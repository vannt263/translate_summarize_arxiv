    "although a cosmological constant ( @xmath13 ) provides a plausible answer to the conundrum posed by dark energy , it is well known that the unevolving cosmological constant faces serious ` fine tuning ' problems since the ratio between @xmath14 and the radiation density , @xmath15 , is already a miniscule @xmath16 at the electroweak scale ( @xmath17 gev ) and even smaller , @xmath18 , at the planck scale ( @xmath19 gev ) .",
    "this issue is further exacerbated by the ` cosmological constant problem ' which arises because the @xmath20-term generated by quantum effects is enormously large @xmath21 , where @xmath22 gev is the planck mass @xcite .",
    "although the cosmological constant problem remains unresolved , the issue of fine tuning which plagues @xmath20 has led theorists to explore alternative avenues for de model building in which either de or its equation of state are functions of time .",
    "( following @xcite we shall refer to the former as quiessence and to the latter as kinessence . ) inspired by inflation , the first dark energy models were constructed around a minimally coupled scalar field ( quintessence ) whose equation of state was a function of time and whose density dropped from a large initial value to the small values which are observed today @xcite .",
    "( ` tracker ' quintessence models had the advantage of allowing the current accelerating epoch to be reached from a large family of initial conditions @xcite . )",

    "the enormous efforts made by these two teams have changed the way cosmologists view their universe .",
    "a recent analysis @xcite of 172 type ia supernovae by hzt gives the following bounds on the cosmic equation of state ( at @xmath29 cl ) -1.48 < w < -0.72 , [ eq : state0 ] when the 2dfgrs prior @xmath30 is assumed @xcite . a similar bound",

    "this ansatz for @xmath43 is exact for the cosmological constant @xmath13 ( @xmath45 ) and for de models with @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",

    "note that the weak energy condition for dark energy @xmath62 has the following form for the ansatz ( [ eq : taylor ] ) : [ eq : wec ] a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 0 ,  a_1 + 2a_2 x 0  , provided we assume that the @xmath63 term in ( [ eq : taylor ] ) is totally due to non - relativistic dark matter and does not include any contribution from dark energy . the demand",
    "that the wec ( [ eq : wec ] ) be satisfied for all @xmath64 ( i.e. in the past as well as in the future ) requires @xmath65 to be non - negative .",
    "however , the demand that the wec ( [ eq : wec ] ) be satisfied in the past ( @xmath66 ) but not necessarily in the future , leads to the somewhat weaker constraint [ eq : wec1 ] a_1 + 2a_2 0 ,   a_2 0  .",

    "= 2.4 in    the presence of the term @xmath63 in ( [ eq : taylor ] ) has two important consequences : ( i ) it ensures that the the universe transits to a matter dominated regime at early times ( @xmath69 ) , ( ii ) it allows us to incorporate information ( available from other data sets ) regarding the current value of the matter density in the universe .",
    "this information can be used to perform a maximum likelihood analysis with the introduction of suitable priors on @xmath70 . in further analysis",
    "we will assume that the @xmath63 term in ( [ eq : taylor ] ) does not include any contribution from dark energy .",
    "we have also studied simple extensions of the ansatz ( [ eq : taylor ] ) by adding new terms @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the @xmath71 term allows @xmath0 to become substantially less than @xmath73 , thereby providing greater leeway to phantom models .",
    "the @xmath72 term allows de to evolve towards equations of state which are more stiff than dust ( @xmath74 ) ; its role is therefore complementary to that of @xmath71 . despite the inclusion of these new terms , our best fit to the supernova data presented below",
    "does not change significantly(choosing @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , which points to the robustness of the ansatz ( [ eq : taylor ] ) for the given data set .",
    "we should add that our reason for choosing an ansatz to fit @xmath43 rather than some other cosmological quantity was motivated by the fact that the hubble parameter is directly related to a fundamental physical quantity ",
    "the ricci tensor , and is therefore likely to remain meaningful even when other quantities ( such as the equation of state ) become ` effective ' .",
    "( this happens for instance , in the case of the braneworld models of dark energy discussed in @xcite . )",
    "the rationale for choosing a three parameter ansatz for @xmath43 is the following .",
    "the observed luminosity distance determined using type ia supernovae is rather noisy , therefore in order to determine the hubble parameter from @xmath77 and following that the equation of state , one must take two derivatives of a noisy quantity .",
    "this difficulty can be tackled in two possible ways : ( i ) either one smoothes the data over some interval @xmath78 ( binning is one possibility ) , or ( ii ) we may choose to smooth ` implicitly ' by parameterizing @xmath43 through an appropriate fitting function .",
    "the number of free parameters @xmath79 in the fit to @xmath43 will be related to the smoothing interval @xmath80 through @xmath81 .",
    "increasing @xmath82 implies decreasing @xmath80 which results in a rapid growth of errors through @xmath83 , and @xmath84 @xcite , therefore in order not to loose too much accuracy in our reconstruction we considered 3 parameter fits for @xmath43 in our paper ( these correspond to 2 parameter fits for @xmath0 ) .",
    "we now test the usefulness of the ansatz  ( [ eq : taylor ] ) in reconstructing different dark energy models .",
    "the ansatz returns exact values for @xmath20cdm , and @xmath85 , @xmath86 quiessence models . in figure",
    "[ fig : err ] we show the accuracy of the ansatz ( [ eq : taylor ] ) when applied to several other dark energy models such as tracker quintessence , the chaplygin gas and super - gravity ( sugra ) models .",
    "we plot the deviation of @xmath87 ( which is the measured quantity for sne ) obtained with the ansatz  ( [ eq : taylor ] ) from the actual model values .",
    "clearly the ansatz performs very well over a significant redshift range for @xmath88 ( also see appendix  [ sec : fits ] ) .",
    "in fact , in the redshift range where sne data is available , the ansatz recovers these models of dark energy with less than @xmath89 errors",
    ". however it would be appropriate to add a note of caution at this point .",
    "although figure  [ fig : err ] clearly demonstrates the usefulness of the ansatz for some de models , its performance vis - a - vis other models of de is by no means guaranteed . by its very construction",
    "the ansatz ( [ eq : taylor ] ) is expected to have limitations when describing models with a fast phase transition @xcite as well as rapidly oscillating quintessence models @xcite .",
    "( the ansatz ( [ eq : taylor ] ) can give reasonable results even for these models provided the resulting de behaviour is suitably smoothed . ) for this reason , although the bulk of our analysis will be carried out using ( [ eq : taylor ] ) , we shall supplement it when necessary with other fitting functions , which will provide us with an independent means with which to test the robustness of our reconstruction exercise .",
    "* methodology :*    for our primary reconstruction , we use a subset of 172 type ia supernovae , obtained by imposing constraints @xmath90 and @xmath91 on the 230 sne sample , as in the primary fit of @xcite . for the ansatz ( [ eq : lumdis ] ) , we require to fit four parameters : ( @xmath92 )",

    ", we have to define the bounds of a four - dimensional volume in @xmath101 .",
    "the bounds of @xmath93 are taken at @xmath102 of the hst prior . for @xmath70 ,",
    "the natural choice is @xmath103 .",

    "this bound is merely a matter of convenience and does not affect our results in any way .",
    "after marginalisation , we have a grid in @xmath100 space on which @xmath107 is specified at each point .",
    "we may now proceed in two ways .",
    "firstly , we may choose to fix @xmath70 at a suitable constant value ( @xmath88 ) thereby obtaining a grid in the @xmath108 plane with @xmath109 ( the probability if @xmath70 is known to be an exact value ) defined at each point .",
    "for a particular redshift , we may then calculate @xmath110 at each point of the grid .",
    "this would yield results that would hold true if @xmath70 were known exactly . instead of using the exact value of @xmath70",
    ", we may use the prior information about it available to us ( @xmath111 ) , and calculate @xmath110 at each point of a three - dimensional grid , the probability @xmath112 at each point being known .",
    "therefore , at any given redshift @xmath2 , @xmath113 can be tagged with a numerical value @xmath114 .",
    "starting from the best - fit @xmath0 ( the value at the peak of the probability distribution ) , we may move down on either side till @xmath115 of the total area is enclosed under the curve , thus obtaining asymmetric @xmath116 bounds on @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath117 bounds can be similarly obtained .",

    "a detailed look at the @xmath118 surface in the ( @xmath104 ) plane ( figure  [ fig : chi ] ) reveals the existence of two minima in @xmath118 , a shallower one close to @xmath20cdm ( @xmath119 ) , and a deeper minimum at @xmath120 .",
    "we would like to draw the readers attention to the fact that imposing the prior @xmath121 amounts to disallowing a significant region of parameter space ( the unshaded region in figure  [ fig : chi ] ) .",
    "consequently an analysis which assumes @xmath122 loses all information about the region @xmath123 around the deeper minimum ! since we have no reason ( observational or theoretical ) to favour either minimum over the other , we shall always choose the deeper minimum as our best - fit in all the subsequent calculations .",

    "we show how the ansatz performs in recovering dark energy models whose equation of state is known , from simulated data .",
    "this ansatz was demonstrated to work extremely well when simulations of snap data were used @xcite .",
    "however , simulation of snap - like data is an optimistic exercise , since data of this quality is unlikely to be available in the near future .",
    "we now demonstrate the accuracy with which the ansatz can recover the fiducial background cosmological model if data is simulated using present - day observational standards . in figures  [ fig : sim_err ] ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , we show how well the ansatz recovers the equation of state for three fiducial models ( assuming @xmath88 ) :    \\(a ) a quiessence dark energy model with a constant equation of state : @xmath182 ,    \\(b ) a generalised chaplygin gas model with @xmath183 : with @xmath184 and the present - day equation of state @xmath185 , which would give rise to an effective equation of state w(z)=- , and    \\(c ) a model with a linearly evolving equation of state : @xmath186 , with @xmath187 .",
    "( for de models with @xmath188 the ansatz is exact therefore we do nt show the results for these cases . )    we find that in all three cases , the fiducial model lies within the @xmath189 confidence limits around the best - fit @xmath0 . based on this result , we claim that within the @xmath132 error bars , the reconstructed equation of state represents the true properties of dark energy when we use real data .    * using other ansatz :*    it is also important to check whether the results of our reconstruction can be replicated using other ansatz such as fits to the luminosity distance or the equation of state .",
    "many different fits have been suggested in the literature ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "here we choose the fit suggested in @xcite in which the equation of state of dark energy is expanded as w(z)=w_0 +  .",

    "we find that for this fit , the errors in the equation of state get larger with redshift , however this fit too demonstrates that the equation of state of dark energy increases rapidly with redshift ( figure  [ fig : lin](a ) ) when no priors are assumed on the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the @xmath118 per degree of freedom at the best - fit is @xmath191 .",
    "when the prior @xmath121 is invoked , the best - fit eos remains very close to the @xmath20cdm model ( figure  [ fig : lin](b ) ) .",
    "therefore , from this ansatz , we may make the statement that at low redshifts , the equation of state of dark energy shows the same signs of rising steeply with redshift if no priors are assumed on the equation of state , thus supporting our earlier results .",
    "the large errors in the equation of state at redshifts of @xmath192 however make it difficult to make any definitive statements about the behaviour of dark energy at high redshifts .",
    "a limitation of the fit ( [ eq : lin ] ) is that it is unable to describe very rapid variations in the equation of state .",
    "an ansatz which accommodates this possibility has been suggested in @xcite w(z)=w_i+ , [ eq : bass ] where @xmath193 is the initial equation of state at high redshifts , @xmath194 is a transition redshift at which the equation of state falls to @xmath195 and @xmath130 describes the rate of change of @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting luminosity distance has the form : = _ 1 ^ 1+z , + where @xmath196 $ ] .",
    "the results for the analysis using this fit to the equation of state are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bass ] .",
    "we find that when the reconstruction is done without any priors on the equation of state ( figure  [ fig : bass](a ) ) , the best fit is _ remarkably close _ to the result for ansatz  ( [ eq : taylor ] ) ( figure  [ fig : total](b ) ) .",
    "the @xmath118 per degree of freedom at the minimum is @xmath197 for this fit .",
    "the errors in this case are somewhat larger , especially at high redshift .",
    "if we constrain @xmath1 , then as before , the evolution of the equation of state is much slower ( figure  [ fig : bass](b ) ) .",
    "so the reconstruction using this ansatz appears to confirm our earlier results .",
    "the above exercises lead us to conclude that our results are neither dependent on the nature of the statistical analysis nor on the manner in which the sne data is sampled .",
    "it therefore appears that dark energy with a steeply evolving equation of state provides a compelling alternative to a cosmological constant if data are analysed in a prior - free manner and the weak energy condition is not imposed by hand .",
    "as this paper was nearing completion , a new dataset consisting of 23 type ia sne was released by the hzt team @xcite .",
    "it is clearly important to check whether or not these new data points corroborate the findings reported in the previous sections .",
    "accordingly , we use a subset of 200 type ia sne with @xmath198 from the 230 sne sample of @xcite , and 22 sne with @xmath199 from the new sample to obtain a best - fit for our ansatz with @xmath88 .",
    "we then plot the magnitude deviation of our best - fit universe from an empty universe with @xmath200 in order to illustrate how well our model fits the data ( figure  [ fig : hubble ] ) . for clarity ,",
    "we plot the median values of the data points .",
    "we obtain medians in redshift bins by requiring that each bin has a width of at least 0.25 in log@xmath2 and contain at least 20 sne . for comparison",
    ", we also plot an @xmath20cdm @xmath201 model , as well as ocdm and scdm models . from figure",
    "[ fig : hubble ] we see that our dark energy reconstruction is a much better fit to sne beyond @xmath202 than @xmath20cdm . at low redshifts ( @xmath203 )",
    "the agreement between data and the two models is rather marginal .",
    "we now add 22 of the new supernovae ( rejecting one with @xmath204 ) to our existing dataset of 172 supernovae and perform de reconstruction on this new dataset of 194 sne , assuming @xmath88 and no other priors .",
    "the resultant figure  [ fig : w_new ] is similar to the figure  [ fig : total](b ) , with slightly smaller errors and has a best - fit @xmath205 .",
    "the above exercises point to the robustness of results reported in previous sections , and indicate that evolving dark energy agrees well with the full data set containing 194 type ia sne .",
    "the energy conditions :    * strong energy condition : @xmath11 ( sec ) , * weak energy condition : @xmath206 , @xmath7 ( wec )    play a vitally important role in our understanding of the accelerating universe , both in the context of inflation and dark energy .",
    "we therefore consider it worthwhile to review certain key developments which deepened our understanding of these issues .    in an expanding frw universe",
    "the sec implies that the universe decelerates while the wec forbids the pressure from becoming too negative .",
    "additionally , in the 1960 s and early 1970 s it was noted that energy conditions play a crucial role in the formulation of the singularity theorems in cosmology .",
    "indeed , one of the necessary conditions for the existence of an initial / final singularity in big bang cosmology is that matter satisfies both the sec and wec @xcite .    by the late 1970 s it became clear that not all forms of matter satisfy the energy conditions .",
    "perhaps the best example of a form of matter which satisfied the weak energy condition but violated the strong one is the cosmological constant , introduced into cosmology by einstein in 1917 .",
    "in addition , the vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor , @xmath207 , which describes quantum effects ( particle production and vacuum polarization ) in an expanding universe could , in certain cases , violate both wec and sec @xcite .",
    "( for certain space - times , such as de sitter space , the vacuum energy momentum tensor generates a cosmological constant since @xmath208 . ) thus by the late 1970 s it was well known that neither of the energy conditions could be held as being sacrosanct .",
    "the 1980 s , as we all know , led to great advances in the development of the inflationary paradigm .",
    "the inflaton field mimics the behaviour of a cosmological constant over sufficiently small intervals of time and therefore violates the sec .",
    "early dark energy models were based on inflaton - type scalars which coupled minimally to gravity ( quintessence ) .",
    "quintessence violates the sec but respects the wec .",
    "precisely because of the latter property , not _ any _ experimentally obtained @xmath42 is compatible with quintessence , as emphasized in @xcite .",
    "( the same observation holds for @xmath43 , since the latter can be derived from @xmath42 using equation ( [ eq : h ] ) . ) clearly if observations do indicate that the wec is violated by de then more general ( wec - violating ) models for de should be seriously considered .",
    "one example of wec - violating de is provided by scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "scalar - tensor models contain at least two functions of the scalar field ( dilaton ) describing dark energy . as shown in @xcite , these two functions , namely , the scalar field potential and its coupling to the ricci scalar @xmath209 , are sufficiently general to explain _ any _ @xmath43 obtained from observations .",
    "the wec can also be effectively violated in de models constructed in braneworld cosmology .",
    "it has recently been shown that such models , with @xmath210 , are in excellent agreement with supernova data @xcite .",
    "since the field equations in these models are derived from a higher dimensional lagrangian the unusually rapid acceleration of the four dimensional universe arises because of the full five dimensional theory and not because of matter which continues to satisfy the energy conditions and whose density remained finite and well behaved at all times @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is in contrast to phantom , which assumes a conventional ` perfect fluid ' form for the energy - momentum tensor and therefore contains pathological features such as an energy density which diverges in the future and a sound speed which is faster than that of light @xcite .",
    "the fact that the observed luminosity distance ( derived from supernova observations ) is better fit by dark energy violating the wec than either quintessence or a cosmological constant was first noticed by @xcite .",
    "caldwell called this ` phantom energy ' and showed that larger values of @xmath70 ( @xmath211 ) implied increasingly more negative values for the equation of state ( @xmath5 ) of phantom .",
    "caldwell s results have since been confirmed by larger and better quality sne data sets  for instance @xcite find that , in the absence of priors being placed on @xmath70 , the de equation of state has a @xmath31 confidence limit of being @xmath32 ! both @xcite and @xcite however work under the assumption that the equation of state of dark energy is unevolving , so that @xmath212 constant .",
    "in this paper we have shown that , suspending the wec prior and allowing the dark energy equation of state to evolve brings out dramatically new properties of dark energy .",
    "thus the dark energy model which best fits the sne observations has an equation of state which rapidly evolves from @xmath213 at present ( @xmath214 ) to @xmath215 at @xmath4 .",
    "dark energy therefore appears to have properties which interpolate between those of dark matter ( dust ) at early times and those of a ` phantom ' ( @xmath5 ) at late times .",
    "this paper reports the model independent reconstruction of the cosmic equation of state of dark energy in which no priors are imposed on @xmath0 . in the literature",
    "the imposition of various priors frequently precedes the analysis of observational data sets .",
    "such a procedure is well founded and entirely justified when priors are dictated by complementary information such as orthogonal observations coming from different data sets . however , on occasion the use of priors is justified on ` theoretical grounds ' and in this case one must be careful so as not to prejudge nature . ( compelling theoretical reasons might well reflect our own particular conditioning or set of prejudices ! ) in the case of the analysis of type ia supernova data , the priors most frequently used have been @xmath212 constant and @xmath216 . both confine de to within a narrow class of models .",
    "moreover , as shown in @xcite , the imposition of such priors on the cosmic equation of state can , on occasion , lead to gross misrepresentations of reality .    in this paper",
    "we do not impose any priors on @xmath0 and reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy in a model independent manner . in this case",
    "our best fit @xmath0 evolves from @xmath5 at @xmath161 , to @xmath3 at @xmath217 ( the upper limit is set by observations ) .",
    "this result is robust to changes in the value of @xmath70 and remains in place within the broad interval @xmath218 .",
    "our reconstruction clearly favours a model of de whose equation of state metamorphoses from @xmath24 in the past to @xmath219 today .",
    "an excellent example of a model which has this property is the chaplygin gas @xcite . however , in this model dark energy does not violate the weak energy condition ( if it was not already violated initially ) .",
    "our results also lend support to the dark energy models discussed in @xcite in which the de equation of state shows a late - time phase transition .",
    "an interesting example of an evolving de model in which @xmath220 at present whereas @xmath221 at earlier times is provided by the braneworld models ( called brane1 ) examined in @xcite which have been shown to agree very well with current supernova observations @xcite .",
    "it is also conceivable that the observed rapid growth in the eos might characterise ` unified ' models of dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) .",
    "we end this paper with a small speculation on this last possibility .",
    "since the nature of both dm and de is currently unknown , it may be that a mechanism exists which converts dm ( with @xmath24 ) into de ( with @xmath25 ) in regions with sufficiently high density contrast @xmath222 .",
    "( this would happen if , for instance , the rate of conversion of dm into de depended upon @xmath223 , etc . )",
    "since the conversion of dm to de is confined to high peaks of the density field this process will not occur uniformly in the entire universe but will be restricted to regions occupying a small filling fraction ( @xmath224 ) ( @xmath225 for regions with @xmath222 ; see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this process could commence as early as @xmath226 when the first peaks in a cdm model collapse .",
    "since de does not cluster and since @xmath227 grows rapidly as the universe expands , de from high density regions ( @xmath225 ) will spread at the speed of light , percolating through the entire universe ( @xmath228 ) by @xmath4 . since the creation of de is tagged to the formation of structure , this model may not encounter the ` coincidence problem ' which plagues other scenarios of de including quintessence .",
    "( however this model might have problems in producing a sufficiently homogeneous and isotropic distribution of dark energy on the largest scales . )",
    "the concrete mathematical framework for a phenomenological model of this kind will be worked out in a companion paper .    in summary , evolving de models have been shown to satisfy sne observations just as well ( if not better ) than the cosmological constant .",
    "our best fit equation of state , in the absence of any priors , evolves from @xmath213 at @xmath214 to @xmath215 at @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig : hubble ] shows that our best fit eos is better able to account for the relative brightness of supernovae at @xmath229 than @xmath20cdm .",
    "however , the evolution in @xmath0 is much weaker if the prior @xmath230 ( @xmath231 ) is imposed . due to the paucity of sne data beyond @xmath232 ( till date",
    ", there is only a single data point beyond @xmath233 , sn1999bf at @xmath234 ) it is not clear whether @xmath215 is a stable asymptotic value for the reconstructed de equation of state at high redshifts . new supernova data at @xmath235 from ongoing as well as planned surveys ( snap ) combined with data from other cosmology experiments ( cmb , lss , s - z survey s , lensing , etc . )",
    "are bound to provide important insights on the nature of dark energy at high redshifts .",
    "our results clearly throw open exciting new possibilities for dark energy model building .",

    "we have seen that the error bars on @xmath0 for the analysis using ansatz  ( [ eq : taylor ] ) are non - monotonic with redshift .",
    "low redshift behaviour of the equation of state affects the luminosity distance at all higher redshifts , while high redshift behaviour effects fewer such distances .",
    "this leads to an expectation that high-@xmath2 behaviour of the equation of state should be poorly constrained as opposed to the low-@xmath2 behaviour .",
    "this seems to contradict the behaviour seen in our figures . to investigate",
    "if this could be explained by our specific method of error analysis we describe the fisher matrix error bars below and show that they are almost identical to what we obtain in our method .    in an analysis which uses an ansatz with @xmath237 parameters @xmath238 ,",
    "the fisher information matrix is defined to be f_ij , where @xmath239 , @xmath240 being the likelihood .",
    "for an unbiased estimator , the errors on the parameters will follow the cramr - rao inequality : @xmath241 .",
    "since the likelihood function is approximately gaussian near the maximum likelihood ( ml ) point , the covariance matrix for a maximum likelihood estimator is given by ( c^-1)_ij .",
    "the fisher information matrix is therefore simply the expectation value of the inverse of the covariance matrix at the ml - point .",
    "given the covariance matrix , the error on any cosmological quantity @xmath242 is given by : [ eq : propagate ] _",
    "q^2 = _ i=1^n ( ) ^2 c_ii+2 _",
    "i=1^n _ j = i+1^n ( ) ( ) c_ij .",
    "thus the nature of the errors on a quantity will depend essentially on the manner in which it is related to the parameters of the system .",
    "we now consider how errors propagate for different cosmological quantities for the polynomial fit to dark energy which we have used for most of the results in this paper : h^2/h_0 ^ 2 = x^3+a_0+a_1 x+a_2 x^2 ,  x=1+z , where @xmath243 .",
    "if @xmath70 is held constant then the parameters of the system are @xmath244 .",
    "= 2.4 in    = 2.4 in    we obtain the covariance matrix in @xmath244 from the ml analysis , and then using equation  ( [ eq : propagate ] ) , calculate the errors on cosmological quantities of interest .",
    "for example , the errors on the quantity @xmath245 are given by : _",
    "^ 2(x ) = ( x-1)^2 [ c_11 + 2 ( x+1 ) c_12+(x+1)^2 c_22 ] .",
    "although the term @xmath246 is negative we find that @xmath247 still _ increases _ with redshift .",
    "this is shown in the figure  [ fig : err_hubb ] .",
    "the errors shown are approximately similar to those obtained in figure  [ fig : dev ] .",
    "the corresponding errors on the equation of state can be calculated using equations  ( [ eq : state2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : propagate ] ) , and has the somewhat more complicated expression : _",
    "w^2(x ) = , where @xmath248 and @xmath105 are the mean values of the parameters .",
    "although in this case it is difficult to predict the behaviour of error bars , after substituting the numerical values we obtain the error bars that are shown in figure  [ fig : err_w ] .",
    "this figure can be compared to the figure  [ fig : total](b ) , having almost identical errors .",
    "this shows that the nature of our error bars is not an artifact of our specific method of error analysis .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig : lin ] , a two parameter expansion in @xmath0 shows monotonically deteriorating errors in @xmath0 with the redshift , while the expansion in @xmath249 shows errors that improve with redshift ( figure  [ fig : total](b ) ) .",
    "this indicates that the nature of error bars might be affected by which quantity is being approximated . in the limit of infinite terms in the expansion of various quantities",
    "all the methods should produce identical result .",
    "the practical need for truncating these expansions make these approximations slightly different from each other . more specifically , we require setting of priors f(z ) & = & _ i=0^ a_n z^n + a_n & = & 0 ;  ( n > n_p ) where @xmath250 could be @xmath43 , @xmath0 or any other physical quantity and @xmath251 is the chosen number of parameters .",
    "the non - linear priors in the above equation make different finite expansions inequivalent . since we do not know for certain if the underlying model for the accelerating expansion involves an energy component with negative pressure in a frw setting we are forced to choose one of the alternatives for approximations .",
    "we hope that with increasingly high quality data the effect of such truncations will eventually disappear .",

    "we take this exercise further and see how well it can reconstruct some of the other fits to dark energy known in literature . in figures  [ fig : sim ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we show results for simulations using @xmath88 and two different fits to the equation of state of dark energy :      \\(b ) the non - perturbative @xmath0 suggested in @xcite and @xcite , which has the parameters @xmath256 ( the dark energy equation of state today ) , @xmath257 ( the dark energy equation of state at the matter dominated epoch ) , @xmath258 ( the redshift where equation of state changes from @xmath257 to @xmath256 ) , and @xmath130 ( the width of transition ) . for the simulation",
    "we again use three sets of values in order of increasing growth rate of @xmath0 : ( a ) @xmath259 , ( b ) @xmath260 , and ( c ) @xmath261 .",
    "we find that in both cases , the ansatz recovers the measured quantity to within @xmath89 accuracy in the redshift range important for sne observations .",
    "thus we find that even for fits for which the ansatz does not return exact values , it can recover cosmological quantities to a high degree of accuracy ."
