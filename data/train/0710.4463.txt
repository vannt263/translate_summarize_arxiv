    "the local baryon density at a space point @xmath42 is the zeroth component of the baryon four - current @xmath43",
    ". the local rest frame ( rf ) baryon density at this space point is defined in the frame where the three - current vanishes , @xmath44 , with @xmath45 .",
    "this definition is known as the eckart frame .",
    "other definitions are possible , e.g. in the landau frame , the energy - momentum tensor is at rest while a baryon three - current might still be present .",
    "we believe however , that the eckart frame definition captures the relevant physics at the energy regime under investigation .    in the context of the urqmd model quantities",

    "the density @xmath51 is a sum of gaussians at position @xmath42 : @xmath52 i.e. , a three - dimensional in @xmath53-direction contracted and normalised gaussian with @xmath54 being the lorentz factor for the particle under consideration .",
    "the normalisation is different for individual particles due to the different @xmath55 factors .",
    "the nominal width of the gaussian is case @xmath56  fm .",
    "the particle that defines position @xmath42 has to be included in the sum because one is interested in the baryon density in the local rest frame of the cell and not in the density around a particle in its rest frame .",
    "the velocity of the cell is computed with the same gaussians as used for the density calculation as weighting functions .",
    "therefore , the velocity of the cell in the computational frame is : @xmath57 the last step is to perform a general lorentz boost of the four - vector @xmath58 into the local rest frame of the cell .",

    "<S> we show that the measurement of di - leptons might provide only a restricted view into the most dense stages of heavy ion reactions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , possible studies of meson and baryon properties at high baryon densities , as e.g. done at gsi - hades and envisioned for fair - cbm , might observe weaker effects than currently expected in certain approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the strong absorption of resonances in the high baryon density region of the heavy ion collision masks information from the early hot and dense phase due to a strong increase of the total decay width because of collisional broadening . to obtain additional information </S>",
    "<S> , we also compare the currently used approaches to extract di - leptons from transport simulations - i.e. shining , only vector mesons from final baryon resonance decays and instant emission of di - leptons and find a strong sensitivity on the method employed in particular at fair and sps energies . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown explicitly that a restriction to @xmath0 meson ( and therefore di - lepton ) production only in final state baryon resonance decays provide a strong bias towards rather low baryon densities . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented are obtained from urqmd v2.3 calculations using the standard set - up .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum - chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) predicts that the properties of hadrons change when they are brought into a ( hot and/or dense ) nuclear environment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this modification is due to the interaction with the surrounding medium which eventually leads to chiral symmetry restoration at high baryon densities and/or high temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental verification of this theoretical prediction is one of the most challenging questions in modern strongly interacting matter physics .    among the non - strange mesons </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 meson plays a dominant role in these investigations . </S>",
    "<S> it has a short lifetime and therefore it has a large probability to decay inside the reaction zone when created in heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> it couples strongly to nuclear resonances and , most important , it has a non - negligible chance to decay into di - leptons which leave the interaction zone essentially without any further interaction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the di - lepton channel seems to offer a unique chance to study the high baryon density properties of the @xmath0 meson .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretically the question of how the spectral function of the @xmath0 meson changes in the medium is still under active discussion . </S>",
    "<S> there is certain theoretical evidence that the @xmath0 meson is broadened if put into the nuclear medium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , hatsuda and lee predicted a lowering of the @xmath0 meson mass in a nuclear environment based on qcd sum rules calculations @xcite . a result which has also been found by brown and rho @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , more recent calculations indicate that the pole mass of the @xmath0 meson remains almost unchanged in the nuclear medium @xcite . however , these calculations rely on specific assumptions on the coupling strength of the @xmath0 meson to the nuclear resonances and on the branching ratios whose validity can presently only be proven by comparison to experimental data . for the present status of the theoretical spectral function calculations for vector mesons we refer to @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> experiments have been launched to verify these theoretical predictions . in proton - nucleus collisions </S>",
    "<S> @xcite at 12 gev a decrease of the @xmath0 meson mass with increasing baryon density @xmath1 as @xmath2 - about half of the value predicted by theory - but without an increase of the @xmath0 meson s width has been reported . </S>",
    "<S> the clas collaboration reports that the experimental data of photon - induced reactions is compatible with no shift of the @xmath0 meson pole mass and no additional broadening to the theoretically estimated collisional broadening @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the di - lepton data in in+in collisions at 158 agev @xcite are best described using essentially the free @xmath0 meson pole mass but a considerable broadening of the spectral function . at lower energies of 2 agev ( see @xcite for the newest data at 1  gev ) , the hades collaboration has recently published di - lepton spectra @xcite . here , a deviation from the yield calculated from a hadronic cocktail fit in the vicinity of the @xmath0 meson mass is visible but due to the many sources of di - leptons there is no conclusive explanation for that suppression yet . </S>",
    "<S> how much of these different experimental findings can be exclusively attributed to the different environments , i.e. cold nuclear matter in proton - nucleus reactions , an expanding meson dominated fireball after a possible phase transition from a quark gluon plasma in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions at the sps or a baryon dominated expansion in reactions at about 2 agev is still a matter of debate .    to link the final state di - lepton data to the in - medium spectral functions of the hadrons detailed quantitative theoretical simulations of the baryon density distribution at the @xmath0 meson production and decay / absorption point are necessary . </S>",
    "<S> this allows then to calculate di - lepton spectra from the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , up to now different approaches are used to convert the calculated hadron spectra into di - leptons . in general four different approaches can be identified :    * explicit propagation of stable particles , baryon and meson resonances , decays of resonances into other mesons ( especially baryonic resonances into @xmath0 mesons ) , as well as @xmath3 scattering . </S>",
    "<S> di - leptons are emitted continuously from vector mesons and baryon resonances with their respective locally given total width while the resonances are propagated ( `` shining '' ) @xcite , * explicit propagation of stable particles , baryon and meson resonances , decay of resonances into other mesons ( especially baryonic resonances into @xmath0 mesons ) , as well as @xmath3 scattering . </S>",
    "<S> di - leptons are only emitted at the point of decay ( not absorption ) of the hadronic resonance @xcite , * explicit propagation of nucleons , pions and nucleon resonances while vector meson degrees of freedom are not propagated explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> di - leptons are produced via the evmd model from nucleonic resonances at the point of the decay of the nucleonic resonances . </S>",
    "<S> this model assumes di - lepton production via intermediate @xmath4 states @xcite , * explicit propagation of nucleons , pions , kaons and @xmath5 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> di - leptons are produced by decay of nucleonic resonances according to the branching ratios . </S>",
    "<S> this is supplemented by the di - lepton production from mesonic resonances , which are calculated by folding the @xmath6 distribution of the elementary nucleon - nucleon collisions with the mesonic production cross sections and the corresponding branching ratios into di - leptons @xcite .    while the first method is sensitive to all stages of the collision and allows for a dynamical treatment of the collisional broadening , </S>",
    "<S> the other methods rely on the actual decay of the meson or baryon resonance . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the different approaches probe different baryon density regimes and might therefore provide different results for the extracted di - lepton rates . </S>",
    "<S> another problem is posed by the implementation of bremsstrahlung especially at low beam energies . </S>",
    "<S> this discussion has recently been revived by the calculations of @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this situation it is necessary to study the general differences between the above discussed approaches and explore the baryon density probed by the @xmath0 meson in the fair energy regime . </S>",
    "<S> this helps to provide a theoretical error margin for further detailed model studies on the change of the in - medium spectral functions at these energies .    </S>",
    "<S> we perform this study for massive nuclear reactions in the energy range of @xmath7  gev . </S>",
    "<S> this range marks the expected transition towards chiral symmetry restoration , but also the transition from baryon dominated to meson dominated matter </S>",
    "<S> . dedicated facilities to explore this energy domain are the fair project at gsi @xcite and the critrhic program at bnl @xcite . for our studies </S>",
    "<S> we employ the urqmd(v2.3 ) model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is a non - equilibrium transport approach based on the covariant propagation of hadrons and strings . </S>",
    "<S> all elementary cross sections are calculated by the principle of detailed balance , from the additive quark model or are derived from available data . </S>",
    "<S> this model allows to study the full space time evolution for all hadrons , resonances and their decay products . </S>",
    "<S> it permits to explore the emission patterns of the resonances in detail and to gain insight into the origin of the resonances @xcite .    in this approach </S>",
    "<S> the resonances are treated with their vacuum properties during the whole evolution of the reaction . </S>",
    "<S> however , one should note that the particle properties are dynamically modified in a hot and/or dense medium due to the coupling of the @xmath0 meson to the surrounding hadrons ( at sis energies especially the baryon resonances are important @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 meson is assumed to have a lifetime according to an exponential distribution with a mean lifetime @xmath8 of @xmath9  mev , in addition collisional broadening is implicitly taken into account for the calculation of di - leptons by the interaction of the @xmath0 meson with the evolving medium .    </S>",
    "<S> urqmd has been successfully applied to study light and heavy ion reactions from @xmath10  mev to @xmath11 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the present version of the transport model is able to describe the yields and the transverse momentum spectra of different particles in proton - proton , proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> detailed comparisons of urqmd with a large body of experimental data at sis and fair energies can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for further details of the model the reader is referred to @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start the discussion by displaying the time evolution of the baryon density in central au+au / pb+pb reactions at 2 , 11 and 30a gev ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ rhob ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the baryon density is averaged over all hadron positions and is calculated locally in the rest frame of the baryon current ( eckart frame ) averaged over the position of every baryon as @xmath12 with @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> details on the calculation of the baryon density are discussed in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> note that the maximal baryon density grows with increasing beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> the question to be asked is , how sensitive are di - lepton observables on the high baryon density stage of the collisions ?    in order to investigate this question , we first review the different production and loss mechanisms for the @xmath0 meson . in urqmd </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 meson can be produced from the decay of a high mass ( meson or baryon ) resonance or directly in a collision of two particles ( e.g. @xmath14 ) which includes also the production from string fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 meson is destroyed by two different mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> it can decay ( `` loss ( decayed ) '' , e.g. @xmath15 ) or it can be absorbed in collisions ( `` loss ( absorbed ) '' , e.g. @xmath16 ) .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ rate ] we show the respective gain and loss rates of @xmath0 mesons separated for the different contributions for central au+au and pb+pb reactions at @xmath17 and @xmath18gev . </S>",
    "<S> the different processes mesons equals the number of outgoing @xmath0 mesons have been discarded from the analysis as they provide only a trivial off - set . ] </S>",
    "<S> in which a @xmath0 meson is produced are denoted as `` gain ( collisions ) '' or `` gain ( decays ) '' ( meaning the stem from the decay of another resonance ) . </S>",
    "<S> the loss term differentiates also between @xmath0 mesons which have decayed `` loss ( decayed ) '' and those which are absorbed in collisions `` loss ( absorbed ) '' as discussed above .    at @xmath19gev </S>",
    "<S> , one observes that the production rate of @xmath0 mesons is dominated by the decay of resonances ( @xmath20% , full line ) as compared to the formation in a s - channel @xmath21 scattering ( @xmath22 20 % , dotted line ) . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is in line with the expectations that a dominant production channel for the @xmath0 meson in low and intermediate energy heavy ion collisions is the decay of baryon resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a previous detailed analysis of the @xmath0 meson production channels at @xmath19gev within the urqmd approach , found in @xcite confirms this interpretation in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of the @xmath0 meson production rate coincides with the maximum baryon density around @xmath23  fm . </S>",
    "<S> however , these @xmath0 mesons are subject to frequent interactions with the surrounding baryons resulting in rather short life times of the @xmath0 mesons as indicated by the large absorption rate ( dashed line ) . only towards the end of the high density stage ( when the @xmath0 absorption processes , e.g. @xmath24 cease ) @xmath0 mesons can decay directly as denoted by the dashed - dotted line . in the present model @xmath0 meson absorption accounts for the main loss of @xmath0 mesons , while the decay accounts for only 30% of the @xmath0 meson loss . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that these features might lead to different time - dependent di - lepton yields , depending on the method with which the di - lepton rates are extracted from the numerical simulation .    at higher energies ( @xmath25 gev , @xmath26 gev ) this low energy line of arguments changes . </S>",
    "<S> here one observes two distinct phases for the production and decay / absorption of the @xmath0 meson . </S>",
    "<S> initially @xmath0 meson production from collisions proceeding either via string formation and fragmentation or via meson - meson scattering dominates the gain term ( dotted line ) . however , also the absorption probability is rather high in this stage of the reaction resulting in a quick re - absorption of the @xmath0 meson ( dashed line ) . for di - lepton calculations </S>",
    "<S> it becomes clear that only a `` shining '' approach has the potential to provide information on this stage , whereas the approaches which depends on the decay of the resonance do not allow to extract this information . </S>",
    "<S> however , also at higher energies , the production of @xmath0 mesons from resonance decays in the late stage of the reaction is sizeable . </S>",
    "<S> this is evident because the sequential processes @xmath27 , @xmath28 will need a certain time and therefore triggers on later stages of the reaction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the @xmath0 meson production from baryon resonance decays again leads towards a self - triggering of @xmath0 meson production and subsequent decay at rather moderate densities , even at energies of @xmath25 gev and @xmath26 gev .    to gauge our assumptions for the absolute importance of the different processes the integrated @xmath0 meson rates </S>",
    "<S> are shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the nomenclature is the same that has been used in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ rate ] . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal evolution of the integrals for three values of beam energies from @xmath29gev to @xmath30gev is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the sum of the gain ( @xmath31 ) and the sum of the loss terms ( @xmath32 ) are displayed . </S>",
    "<S> if one subtracts the sum of the loss terms from the sum of the gain terms one gets the yield ( @xmath33 ) of @xmath0 mesons which is present at each time step of the collision .    as discussed above , at the lowest energy the gain via resonance </S>",
    "<S> decays dominates over the gain from direct @xmath0 meson production due to kinematical constraints . </S>",
    "<S> however , this behaviour reverses already at @xmath34gev . at the highest energy ( @xmath30gev ) </S>",
    "<S> displayed already a factor of 2.5 more @xmath0 mesons are produced in collisions than in decays of other resonances . </S>",
    "<S> for the loss term we observe a dominance of the absolute value of decayed @xmath0 mesons at @xmath30gev .    </S>",
    "<S> let us investigate the baryon density distribution at the space - time position of the @xmath0 meson decay and absorption in more detail . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",

    "<S> one clearly observes that absorption of the @xmath0 meson in the most dense medium reached at sis energies ( @xmath35 ) is already a strong effect . </S>",
    "<S> if only decaying @xmath0 mesons are taken into account the effective density probed reduces to ( @xmath36 ) at higher beam energies ( @xmath25  gev , @xmath26  gev ) this splitting in the density between decaying @xmath0 mesons and absorbed @xmath0 mesons becomes even more pronounced . here , absorption processes are strongly dominating the high baryon density stage , while decays populate the low baryon density region .    to relate the present discussion directly to the sensitivity of di - leptons to the most dense stages of the reaction , di - lepton rates </S>",

    "<S> for each energy , the di - lepton production as a function of baryon density is separated into a part where the initial @xmath0 meson decays ( dashed lines ) and a part where the @xmath0 meson was absorbed by the medium ( dotted lines ) , the sum of both contributions provides the total emission rate of di - leptons and is shown as full lines .    </S>",
    "<S> two different scenarios related to the initially discussed theoretical approaches for the di - lepton extraction can be discussed :    1 .   in the first scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the full branching ratio into di - leptons is attached to both the @xmath0 decay and the @xmath0 absorption vertices ( shown as thin lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> this provides the most optimistic reach towards high baryon densities , as it assumes that no collisional broadening takes place even in the most dense stage of the reaction ( i.e. its a full vacuum baseline calculation ) . on the one hand , this setting is similar to the one employed in models that calculate di - leptons from folding the @xmath39 distribution of nucleon - nucleon collisions as it assumes no interaction of the produced @xmath0 meson with the medium , i.e. absorption . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if one omits the di - leptons emitted in the absorption process , these calculations are similar to previous calculations that assume di - lepton production only from the late stage decays of ( baryon ) resonances . </S>",

    "<S> is assumed over the whole lifetime of the @xmath0 meson ( generally for all relevant hadrons ) . </S>",
    "<S> the di - lepton emission rate is then integrated over time , taking the collisional broadening for each individual vector meson in its surrounding into account . due to the strong collisional </S>",

    "<S> is reduced to 1 - 2 @xmath40 in contrast to the expected values around 2 - 3 @xmath40 from scenario 1 . at higher energies ( @xmath25  gev , @xmath26  gev ) , the reach of di - leptons into the most dense stage is also strongly reduced . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , late stage decays of baryon resonances and @xmath0 mesons provide a strong trigger towards low baryon densities , resulting in strong peak of the di - lepton emission rate below 1 - 1.5 @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this low density peak might possibly blur the view on the most interesting di - leptons from the most dense stages of the reaction .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we explore the average baryon density experienced by @xmath0 mesons with different masses . </S>",

    "<S> [ mass ] gives the results of the present calculation for the creation , absorption and decay point of the respective @xmath0 meson . </S>",
    "<S> one observes that the baryon density of the system is constant as a function of the mass , indicating that most @xmath0 mesons , independent of their mass decay at a certain ( low ) baryon density , as argued before . </S>",
    "<S> note that the baryon density where @xmath0 mesons are absorbed is higher , which is in line with the previous discussion .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the measured di - leptons provide only a restricted view into the most dense stages of the reaction despite the fact that electromagnetic probes leave the reaction zone without any further interaction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , possible studies of meson and baryon properties at highest baryon densities might be blurred . for the @xmath0 meson </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the baryon density probed in the di - lepton decay channel does depend on the method of di - lepton extraction employed . </S>",
    "<S> we argued that the absorption of resonances in the high baryon density region of a heavy ion collision masks information from the early hot and dense stage . to demonstrate this , we have split </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of the loss term of the @xmath0 meson yield into `` loss(absorbed ) '' and `` loss(decayed ) '' and have shown that at early times , i.e. at the highest baryon densities the absorption results in substantial reduction of the @xmath0 meson life times . </S>",
