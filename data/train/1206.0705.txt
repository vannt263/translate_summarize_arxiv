    "a nonlinear schrdinger equation has been recently advanced by nobre , rego - monteiro and tsallis @xcite .",
    "the nrt proposal constitutes an intriguing contribution to a line of enquiry that has been the focus of continuous research activity for several years : the exploration of non - linear versions of some of the fundamental equations of physics @xcite .",
    "the nrt equation is inspired in the thermostatistical formalism based upon the tsallis @xmath2 non - additive , power - law entropic functional , whose applications to the study of diverse physical system and processes have attracted considerable attention in recent years ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , the @xmath2 entropy constitutes a useful tool for the analysis of diverse problems in quantum physics @xcite .    the nrt nonlinear schrdinger equation governing the field @xmath3 ( `` wave function '' ) corresponding to a particle of mass @xmath4 reads @xcite , @xmath5= -\\frac{1}{2-q}\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2 } { \\partial x^2 } \\left[\\frac{\\phi(x , t)}{\\phi_0 } \\right]^{2-q},\\ ] ] where the scaling constant @xmath6 guarantees an appropriate physical normalization for the different terms appearing in the equation , @xmath7 is the imaginary constant , @xmath8 is planck s constant , and @xmath0 is a real parameter formally associated with tsallis entropic index in non - extensive thermostatistics @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the wave equation ( [ qsnl ] ) admits time dependent solutions having the `` @xmath0-plane wave '' form , @xmath9^{\\frac{1}{1-q}},\\ ] ] with @xmath10 and @xmath11 real parameters having , respectively , dimensions of inverse length and inverse time ( that is , @xmath10 can be regarded as a wave number and @xmath11 as a frequency ) . in the limit @xmath1 , the @xmath0-plane waves ( [ qplane ] )",
    "reduce to the plane wave solutions @xmath12 of the standard , linear schrdinger equation describing a free particle of mass @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath0-plane wave solutions ( [ qplane ] ) propagate at a constant velocity @xmath13 without changing shape , thus exhibiting a soliton - like behaviour .",
    "moreover , and in contrast to the @xmath1 case yielding standard plane waves , the solutions corresponding to @xmath14 do nt have a spatially constant modulus .",
    "in fact ( defining @xmath15 ) we have , @xmath16^{\\frac{1}{1-q}},\\ ] ] which corresponds , for @xmath17 to a normalizable @xmath0-gaussian centered at @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , in this case the @xmath0-plane wave solution describes a phenomenon characterized by a certain degree of spatial localization .",
    "a field - theoretical approach to the nrt equation was developed in @xcite , where it was shown that this equation can be derived from a variational principle .",
    "the nonlinear nrt equation is formally related to the nonlinear fokker - planck equation ( nlfp ) with a diffusion term depending on a power of the density .",
    "these kind of evolution equations , and their relations with the nonextensive thermostatitical formalism , have been the focus of an intensive research recently @xcite . in spite of the formal resemblance between the nrt schrdinger equation and the nonlinear fokker - planck ,",
    "there are profound differences between these two types of equations .",
    "for instance , the nonlinear fokker - planck equation does not admit @xmath0-plane wave solutions of the form ( [ qplane ] ) , that propagate without changing their shape .",
    "a property of the solutions ( [ qplane ] ) that was highlighted by nrt @xcite is that they are consistent with the celebrated de broglie relations @xcite , @xmath19 connecting , respectively , energy with frequency and momentum with wave number .",
    "indeed , it can be verified that the @xmath0-plane wave ( [ qplane ] ) satisfies the equation ( [ qsnl ] ) if and only if the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath10 comply with the relation , @xmath20 which , combined with ( [ earlyqu ] ) , lead to the standard relation between linear momentum and kinetic energy , @xmath21 this suggests that it is conceivable that the @xmath0-plane wave ( [ qplane ] ) represents a particle of mass @xmath4 with kinetic energy @xmath22 and momentum @xmath23 @xcite .    wave packets ( in particular gaussian wave packets ) are of paramount importance in quantum mechanics , both from the conceptual and practical points of view @xcite .",
    "wave packets also played a distinguished role in the historical development of quantum physics @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to explore the existence of time dependent wave packet solutions of the nrt nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the original presentation of the nrt equation @xcite was strongly focused upon the @xmath0-plane wave solutions .",
    "however , as a first step towards elucidating the meaning of the nrt equation , it is imperative to explore more general solutions .",
    "the aim of the present effort is to investigate a family of exact analytical time dependent solutions to the nrt equation exhibiting the form of @xmath0-gaussian wave packets and corresponding , in the limit @xmath1 , to the celebrated gaussian wave packets solutions of the linear schrdinger equation .",
    "in this work we are going to investigate solutions to the nrt equation based upon the @xmath0-gaussian wave packet ansatz , @xmath24^{\\frac{1}{1-q}},\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are appropriate ( complex ) time dependent coefficients .",
    "notice that @xmath28 depends on time only through these three parameters . inserting the ansatz ( [ qgauswp ] ) into the left and the right hand sides of the nrt equation ( [ qsnl ] ) one obtains , @xmath29 and , @xmath30\\psi^q \\label{der_2}.\\ ] ] combining now equations",
    "( [ qsnl ] ) , ( [ der_1 ] ) , and ( [ der_2 ] ) one sees that the ansatz ( [ qgauswp ] ) constitutes a solution of the nrt equation provided that the coefficients @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 comply with the set of coupled ordinary differential equations , @xmath31 the above set of differential equations admits the general solution , @xmath32,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are integrations constants determined by the initial conditions @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41      let us now briefly consider the limit @xmath42 of the evolving @xmath0-gaussian wave packet . in this case the time dependent parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are ,    @xmath46    with @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 integration constants . the general solution can be written as    @xmath47^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\cr & = & \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\ln \\left(\\frac{2i\\hbar t}{m}+\\alpha \\right)- \\frac{(\\beta/2+x)^2}{\\frac{2i\\hbar t}{m}+\\alpha } + \\gamma\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    taking now @xmath48 and defining @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , ( [ quno ] ) can be cast under the guise ,    @xmath51    recovering the well known gaussian wave packet solution of the standard linear schrdinger equation .",
    "the evolution of the time dependent @xmath0-gaussian solution is illustrated in figure 1 , where the square modulus @xmath53 of an initially localized solution is depicted against the ( nondimensional ) time variable @xmath54 and spatial coordinate @xmath55 , for @xmath52 ( here @xmath56 stands for the modulus of the intial value of the parameter @xmath25 ) .",
    "it is interesting that in the nonlinear ( @xmath52 ) case , as time progresses , @xmath57 develops two peaks that depart from each other .",
    "this behaviour exhibits some qualitative similarity with the evolution of an initially localized particle in the tight binding model @xcite .     determined by the nrt nonlinear schrdinger equation with @xmath52 and initial conditions given by @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "all depiced quantities are dimensionless . ]",
    "when @xmath62 the set of coupled differential goberning the evolution of the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , admit the solution ,    @xmath63    where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , are time independent constants .",
    "the concomitant solution to the nrt equation reads ,    @xmath67^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ]    it is interesting that the solution ( [ wqutres ] ) is periodic ( with period , in the dimensionless time variable @xmath68 , equal to @xmath69 ) even though the particle is not subjected to an external confining potential .",
    "indeed , this solution describes a quasi - stationary scenario where the shape of @xmath57 `` pulsates '' with the abovementioned period . in the extreme case given by @xmath70 ,",
    "the amplitude of the `` pulsations '' vanishes and we obtain the stationary solution ,    @xmath71^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ]    the norm @xmath72 of this last solution is finite provided that @xmath73 and @xmath74 is not a real number .",
    "it is interesting that there are `` frozen '' solutions like ( [ qutrequieta ] ) also for instances of the nrt equation characterized by other values of @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , it can be verified that the nrt equation admits stationary solutions of the form    @xmath75^{\\frac{1}{2-q}},\\ ] ]    with @xmath76 and @xmath77 real constants .",
    "the square modulus @xmath53 of the `` frozen '' solutions ( [ frozen ] ) has a @xmath0-gaussian profile ,    @xmath78^{\\frac{1}{2-q}}\\ ] ]    and a finite norm for @xmath79 .",
    "notice that the solutions ( [ frozen ] ) can be cast under the guise of a @xmath0-exponential , but with a @xmath0-value given by @xmath80 , which is different from the @xmath0-value associated with the concomitant nonlinear nrt evolution equation .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , the solutions ( [ frozen ] ) are not comprised within those corresponding to the ansatz ( [ qgauswp ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath81 leads to a family of particular solution of the set of equations ( [ qudyn ] ) , given by ,    @xmath82    where @xmath65 and @xmath83 are complex constants . a simple but important case is obtained when the constant @xmath65 is purely imaginary and @xmath84 ,    @xmath85    which , after setting @xmath86 , is clearly seen to correspond to the @xmath0-plane wave solutions considered in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the exact solutions to the nrt equation studied in @xcite constitute a particular case of the time dependent @xmath0-gaussian wave packet investigated here .",
    "another interesting particular instance of the solutions associated with ( [ simple ] ) corresponds to the case where the constant @xmath65 is a real number and @xmath87 , with @xmath88 a real constant with dimensions of time , leading to ,    @xmath89^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}.\\ ] ]    the squared modulus of the above soution has a @xmath0-gaussian form ,    @xmath90^{\\frac{1}{1-q } } \\left\\ { 1 + \\left [ \\frac{2m(1-(1-q)b_c x)}{(1-q)\\hbar b_c^2 ( t+t_0 ) } \\right]^2 \\right\\}^{\\frac{1}{1-q}},\\ ] ]    leading to a finite norm , @xmath72 , for @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( see next subsection ) .",
    "the solution ( [ simplunexpected ] ) exhibits a finite - time singularity in the past : indeed , its norm diverges at the finite time @xmath93 . in the limit",
    "@xmath1 the solutions ( [ simplunexpected ] ) go to    @xmath94,\\ ] ]    which are formal solutions of the standard linear schrdinger equation but are , evidently , physically unacceptable because they are not normalizable ( and the wave function s square modulus @xmath53 itself diverges when @xmath95 ) .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting that the non - linearity associated with @xmath96 not only regularizes ( in the sense of leading to a finite norm @xmath97 ) the plane wave solutions of the schrdinger equation ( as stressed by nrt in @xcite ) but it also regularizes the exponential solutions ( [ expoexplodes ] ) ( at least for all times @xmath98 ) .",
    "it is known that , in general , time dependent solutions to the nrt nonlinear schrdinger equation do not preserve the norm @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-plane wave solutions studied in @xcite constitute a remarkable exception : they do preserve the norm . up to now the @xmath0-plane wave solutions where the only known time dependent solutions to the nrt equation .",
    "this means that no norm non - preserving explicit solution was known before our present work .",
    "therefore , it is of some interest to explore whether the solutions to the nrt equation investigated here preserve the norm or not .",
    "the norm @xmath97 of the @xmath0-gaussian wave packet is given by , @xmath99 where @xmath100^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}.\\ ] ] when @xmath101 the @xmath0-gaussian wave packet is normalizable ( that is , @xmath102 ) provided that @xmath103 and the polynomial @xmath104 does nt have real roots . notice that for @xmath105 the range of @xmath0-values admitting normalizable @xmath0-gaussian wave functions of the form ( [ qgauswp ] ) is larger than the range of @xmath0-values leading to normalizable @xmath0-plane wave functions ( which is @xmath17 @xcite ) .",
    "let us now consider a concrete instance of a solution to the nrt equation that does not preserve the norm .",
    "in the case of the solution ( [ simplunexpected ] ) the norm is ,    @xmath106^{\\frac{1}{2 } + \\frac{1}{1-q } } \\int_{-\\infty}^{+ \\infty } du \\left[1 + u^2 \\right]^{\\frac{1}{1-q } } \\cr \\ , & = & \\ , \\frac{1}{|1-q| b_c } \\left[\\frac{(1-q)^2 \\hbar^2}{4 m^2 } b_c^4 ( t+t_0)^2 \\right]^{\\frac{1}{2 } + \\frac{1}{1-q } } \\sqrt{\\pi } \\,\\ , \\frac{\\gamma   \\left ( { \\frac { 3-q}{2(q-1 ) } } \\right ) } { \\gamma   \\left (   \\frac{1}{q-1 } \\right)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the norm is finite for @xmath91 and @xmath92 and proportional to @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , the norm is not conserved : it vanishes in the limit @xmath108 , it is a finite and monotonously decreasing function of time for all finite times @xmath109 , and it diverges at @xmath93 .",
    "consequently , ( [ simplunexpected ] ) constitutes an explicit example of a norm non - preserving solution to the nrt equation .    as a final comment ,",
    "let us mention that the non conservation of the norm suggests that , when considering pairs of time dependent solutions @xmath110 and @xmath111 to the nrt equation , the overlap @xmath112 is not conserved either",
    ". however , there may still be some conserved measure of the `` distance '' or `` fidelity '' between pairs of time dependent solutions .",
    "the search for such a measure constitutes a line of enquiry that may shed new light on the nature of the nrt dynamics . a possible direction to explore in this regard",
    "would be the one suggested by yamano and iguchi in @xcite , where non - csiszar @xmath113-divergence measures where considered in connection with nonlinear liouville - type equations .",
    "now we are going to use the @xmath0-gaussian ansatz ( [ qgauswp ] ) to investigate time dependent solutions of nonlinear schrdinger equation given by    @xmath114    where @xmath115 . in the limit",
    "@xmath42 the above equation reduces to the time dependent schrdinger equation of the quantum harmonic oscillator . inserting the ansatz ( [ qgauswp ] ) in the right hand side of equation ( [ quharmo ] ) we get    @xmath116\\psi^q+\\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\psi^q\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left[\\left(\\frac{m}{\\hbar^2}k-2(3-q)a(t)^2\\right)x^2 - 2(3-q)a(t)b(t)x+2a(t)-2(1-q)a(t)c(t)-b(t)^2\\right]\\psi^q \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    comparing eq.([der_1 ] ) with ( [ der_2 ] ) we obtain the following set of coupled differential equations for the evolution of the parameters appearing in the ansatz    @xmath117    integrating the first of these equation one obtains ,    @xmath118    where @xmath119 is an integration constant .      a particularly interesting solution of the set of equations ( [ abc_harmon ] ) is given by ,    @xmath120,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    leading , in turn , to the following solution for the non - linear schrdinger equation ,    @xmath121^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}.\\ ] ]    it is interesting to consider now the @xmath42 limit of the above solution ,    @xmath122^{\\frac{1}{1-q } } \\cr \\ , & = & \\ , \\exp\\left(-i\\frac{\\hbar",

    "the norm of the solution ( [ quasiest ] ) is finite for @xmath125 and @xmath126 with @xmath127 , and it has finite - time sigularities at @xmath128 .",

    "therefore , the time dependent solution ( [ quasiest ] ) constitutes another explicit example of a solution that does not preserve the norm . in the limit @xmath1 we get @xmath130 and , of course , @xmath131",
    "the existence of @xmath0-plane wave solutions consistent with the de broglie relations connecting frequency and wave number respectively with energy and momentum was one of the features of nrt equation discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that there are other possible nonlinear schrdinger - like equations exhibiting similar properties .",
    "that is , the nrt approach can be substantially generalized .",

    "indeed , inserting the ansatz ( [ genplanwe ] ) into the right and left hand sides ( [ genert ] ) and setting @xmath138 we get ,    @xmath139   & = & \\left ( \\frac{df}{du } \\right ) \\left ( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t } \\right )   = \\hbar w \\ , \\frac{df}{du } , \\cr -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m } \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\left[l \\left ( \\frac{\\phi(x , t)}{\\phi_0 } \\right)\\right ] & = & -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m } \\frac{d^2}{d u^2}\\left[l \\left(u \\right)\\right ] \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x } \\right)^{\\!\\!2 } = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m } \\ , \\frac{d^2}{du^2 } \\left [ l(f(u ) ) \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , in the last equation , the fact that @xmath140 was used .",
    "it is plain that the functional relation ( [ nicecouple ] ) implies ( [ genert ] ) , provided that @xmath137 .",
    "this in turn leads , via the de broglie relations , to the kinetic energy - momentum relation @xmath141 .",
    "similarly to what happens within the nrt scenario , the solutions ( [ genplanwe ] ) to the non linear evolution equation ( [ genert ] ) propagate without changing shape and with constant velocity @xmath142 .",

    "one procedure to generate pairs of functions satisfying ( [ nicecouple ] ) is the following .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the nrt equation was inspired by the nonextensive generalized thermostatistical formalism based on the constrained optimization of tsallis entropy @xcite .",
    "indeed , there are formal connections between the nrt scenario and the alluded thermostatistical formalism . an intriguing question , which is beyond the scope of the present work but certainly deserves to be explored , is the possible existence of connections between ( some of ) the nonlinear schrdinger equations ( [ genert ] ) , on the one hand , and other formalisms based on non - standard entropic functionals different from the tsallis one @xcite , on the other hand .",
    "we have seen that the nrt equation is not the only nonlinear equation of the form ( [ genert ] ) admitting plane wave - like solutions consistent with the de broglie relations .",

    "finally , we have ,    @xmath166    involving one more integration constant @xmath167 .",
    "making now the identification @xmath168 one sees that ( up to multiplicative and additive constants ) the form of the solution ( [ voila_almost_qexp ] ) coincides with @xmath0-gaussian wave packet .",

    "our solutions have the form of a @xmath0-exponential evaluated upon a quadratic function of the spatial coordinate @xmath169 with time dependent coefficients . therefore , these solutions have a @xmath0-gaussian form . they extend and generalize the previously known solutions to the nrt equation .",

    "<S> the nrt equation , inspired in the @xmath0-generalized thermostatistical formalism , is characterized by a parameter @xmath0 , and in the limit @xmath1 reduces to the standard , linear schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-gaussian solutions to the nrt equation investigated here admit as a particular instance the previously known @xmath0-plane wave solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the present work thus extends the range of possible processes yielded by the nrt dynamics that admit an analytical , exact treatment . in the @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> limit the @xmath0-gaussian solutions correspond to the gaussian wave packet solutions to the free particle linear schrdinger equation . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> we also show that there are other families of nonlinear schrdinger - like equations , besides the nrt one , exhibiting a dynamics compatible with the de broglie relations . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , however , the existence of time dependent gaussian - like wave packet solutions is a unique feature of the nrt equation not shared by the aforementioned , more general , families of nonlinear evolution equations . </S>"
