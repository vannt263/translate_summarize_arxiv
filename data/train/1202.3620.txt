    "the stable aromatic free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ( dpph ) is one of the first and most widely used standard samples for determination of the @xmath0-factors of the spin species and for measuring the unpaired spin concentration using electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) @xcite .",
    "dpph was synthesized in 1922 , and its epr spectrum was recorded for the first time in 1950 @xcite .",
    "chemical stability of dpph and its very narrow spectral line have led to the widespread use of the powder form of this radical as an epr standard @xcite .",
    "single crystals of dpph are also frequently used in epr spectroscopy because the linewidth they produce is considerably narrower than that of the powder form .",
    "various types of dpph crystals have been prepared up to now  some of them are solvent free and some contain molecules of solvation @xcite . in the cambridge structural database @xcite crystal structures of two dpph solvates , one with acetone @xcite and the other with benzene @xcite , are deposited .",
    "the benzene solvate was also investigated by neutron diffraction @xcite .",
    "some preliminary x - ray diffraction measurements , done by williams @xcite , indicated that the dpph crystal forms obtained from diethyl ether ( ether ; orthorhombic crystal system ) and carbon disulfide (; triclinic crystal system ) were both solvent free .",
    "however , their crystal structures have never been solved , i.e.  no atomic coordinates have been deposited in the cambridge structural database @xcite .",
    "more recently , a new application of dpph  in detecting local fields in the close vicinity of the surface of superconductors @xcite and single molecule magnets @xcite  has been established in our laboratory .",
    "these results prompted us to investigate the properties of dpph in more details .",
    "in this paper , we report on the single - crystal x - ray diffraction study , as well as the ir , epr and squid magnetization measurements of the two williams  solvent - free  forms @xcite of dpph , i.e. the one grown from ether ( dpph1 ) and the other form crystallized from ( dpph2 ) .",
    "a detailed structural analysis showed that the orthorhombic dpph form ( crystallized from ether ) , in accord with the previous preliminary measurements @xcite , does not really contain solvent molecules ; however , the triclinic dpph form ( crystallized from ) , believed to be solvent free for 40 years , is actually a solvate with the stoichiometry .",

    "the values are close to the free electron value of 0.375  emuk / mol , and according to the epr measurements , this should be the case also for dpph1 and dpph2 . from the epr data , using @xmath41 , one can see that there are 96.5% radical electrons of the spin @xmath42 per formula unit of dpph1 and 93.3% radical electrons per formula unit of dpph2 .",
    "approximately the same values for the curie constant @xmath43 result from the curie - weiss analysis of @xmath44 , where the slope of the straight line gives @xmath45  emuk / mol for dpph1 and @xmath46  emuk / mol for dpph2 . from here , the curie - weiss parameter @xmath47 amounts @xmath48 and @xmath49  k for dpph1 and dpph2 , respectively .",
    "the negative values of this parameter point to the antiferromagnetic interactions in both samples .",
    "the obtained values are somewhat smaller than for other measured dpph crystals , where the @xmath47 values were found to be from @xmath50 to @xmath51  k @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that these parameters are empirical and descriptive only , and might not give the true values of interaction energies .",
    "the antiferromagnetic interactions for both compounds are indicated by the downward bending of the @xmath38 curves with decreasing temperature ( figure [ magnetization ] ) .",
    "magnetic correlations have visible effects starting approximately from 50 and 150  k for dpph1 and dpph2 , respectively .",
    "moreover , it seems that for dpph2 there are two characteristic temperatures ( energies ) .",
    "for further discussion of magnetic behavior of these compounds , their structural characteristics should be taken into account .",
    "it appears that consideration of the 3d long - range interactions would not be appropriate , as no pathways for such interactions could be observed in the crystal structures . instead",
    ", a more precise interpretation of the magnetic data should be found in dimer interactions of radical electrons .",

    "only the c - n - n fragments are shown , with the closest distances between the central n atoms ( according to the crystallographic and dft studies , the unpaired electron is delocalized over the bonds ) .",
    "it is easy to notice that all molecules in dpph1 are coupled into dimers ( figure [ dpph1-interaction ] ) .",
    "pairs of symmetry independent molecules ( in the same asymmetric unit ) group into dimers with the centroid distances of 5.82   .",
    "other paramagnetic neighbors are mutually much more distant ( more than 7   ) .    in dpph2",

    "those labelled as * a * ( red , lighter molecules ) are mutually closer ( 6.11   ) than those labelled as * b * ( blue , darker molecules , 7.35   ) .",
    "it could be concluded that the dpph2 molecules are divided into two types of dimers with different distances between the unpaired electrons , which could lead to different exchange parameters .    according to the previously mentioned , the susceptibility of dpph1 is fitted by the following equation : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the relative amount of molecules coupled into dimers and @xmath54 is the relative amount of single molecules interacting weakly with other neighboring molecules .",
    "the uncoupled single paramagnetic centers could originate from the defects and surface effects in the crystals .",
    "the susceptibility of dimers is given by : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the heisenberg exchange coupling ( defined by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath57 ) between two unpaired electrons in a dimer @xcite . other parameters have their usual meanings .",
    "the curie - weiss molar susceptibility of weakly interacting spin @xmath42 molecules is : @xmath58 when @xmath41 is assumed in accordance with the epr determination , the best fit is achieved with and . at the same time , the obtained antiferromagnetic exchange coupling within the dimers is @xmath59  k and the long - range interaction curie - weiss parameter @xmath60  k. the agreement between the measured data and the fitted function is excellent in the whole interval of temperature ( see figure [ magnetization ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath56 is close to the already published data on other dpph crystals @xcite .",
    "the dpph2 susceptibility was analyzed assuming the coexistence of two kinds of dimers with different exchange couplings .",
    "therefore , the data were fitted by : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the relative amounts of molecules coupled into particular types of magnetic dimers with the exchange energies @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "the obtained parameters are @xmath66 and @xmath67 , whereas the corresponding exchange interactions are @xmath68  k and @xmath69  k. in figure [ dpph2-interaction ] , @xmath64 and @xmath65 could be associated with the molecules labelled as * b * ( blue , darker molecules ) and * a * ( red , lighter molecules ) , respectively .",
    "the fitting of the @xmath38 curves ( inset in figure [ magnetization ] ) gave consistently the same parameters for both compounds .",
    "however , the obtained results for the exchange parameters for dpph1 ( @xmath59  k ) and for the * a * labelled molecules in dpph2 ( red , lighter molecules , @xmath69  k ) , which have approximately the same mutual distance within dimers , are significantly different .",
    "the difference arises from the different orientation of molecules in dpph1 and dpph2 .",
    "the molecules forming dimers in dpph1 are almost mutually perpendicular ( the angle between the planes which are determined by the c - n - n fragment , is 80.4@xmath15 ) and the molecules forming dimers in dpph2 are mutually parallel ( for both types of dimers ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the molecular field model in which the neighboring dimers mutually interact gave poor agreement with the measured data .",
    "the possible explanation lies in the fact that at low temperatures the antiferromagnetically coupled dimers are in the singlet state , and their mutual interactions are therefore unlikely .    the magnetic susceptibility analysis showed the presence of magnetic dimerization in both dpph1 and dpph2 , but the amounts of entities participating and the strength of exchange couplings are different for the two samples , in accord with their crystal structures .",
    "crystal structures for two dpph samples were solved : dpph1 , crystallized from ether , and dpph2 , crystallized from . the single - crystal x - ray diffraction analysis ( and also ir spectroscopy ) showed that the single crystals of dpph1 are solvent free and those of dpph2 contain one molecule of in the unit cell . from the epr",
    "measurement principal values of the @xmath0-tensors at room ( 297  k ) and low ( 10  k ) temperatures were obtained .",
    "although the crystals of dpph2 give a narrower linewidth , the crystals of dpph1 , due to an almost insignificant change of linewidth with decreasing temperature ( from room temperature to @xmath22  k ) and a lower @xmath0-tensor anisotropy , prove to be more suitable as the epr probe .",
    "the magnetization study show pairing into dimers with the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling of @xmath70  k for all molecules in dpph1 and pairing into two kinds of dimers ( _ ca _ 50 - 50% ) with the antiferromagnetic exchange couplings of @xmath71  k and @xmath72  k , in dpph2 .",
