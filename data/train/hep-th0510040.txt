    "these notes summarize the lectures presented at the 2005 cern - claf school in malarge , argentina and the 2009 cern - claf school in medelln , colombia .",
    "the audience in both occasions was composed to a large extent by students in experimental high energy physics with an important minority of theorists .",
    "in nearly ten hours it is quite difficult to give a reasonable introduction to a subject as vast as quantum field theory .",
    "for this reason the lectures were intended to provide a review of those parts of the subject to be used later by other lecturers .",
    "although a cursory acquaitance with th subject of quantum field theory is helpful , the only requirement to follow the lectures it is a working knowledge of quantum mechanics and special relativity .",
    "the guiding principle in choosing the topics presented ( apart to serve as introductions to later courses ) was to present some basic aspects of the theory that present conceptual subtleties .",
    "those topics one often is uncomfortable with after a first introduction to the subject . among them",
    "we have selected :    * the need to introduce quantum fields , with the great complexity this implies .",
    "* quantization of gauge theories and the rle of topology in quantum phenomena .",
    "we have included a brief study of the aharonov - bohm effect and dirac s explanation of the quantization of the electric charge in terms of magnetic monopoles . * quantum aspects of global and gauge symmetries and their breaking . * anomalies . * the physical idea behind the process of renormalization of quantum field theories . * some more specialized topics , like the creation of particle by classical fields and the very basics of supersymmetry .",
    "these notes have been written following closely the original presentation , with numerous clarifications .",
    "sometimes the treatment given to some subjects has been extended , in particular the discussion of the casimir effect and particle creation by classical backgrounds .",
    "since no group theory was assumed , we have included an appendix with a review of the basics concepts .    by lack of space and purpose ,",
    "few proofs have been included . instead",
    ", very often we illustrate a concept or property by describing a physical situation where it arises .",
    "full details and proofs can be found in the many textbooks in the subject , and in particular in the ones provided in the bibliography @xcite .",
    "specially modern presentations , very much in the spirit of these lectures , can be found in references @xcite .",
    "we should nevertheless warn the reader that we have been a bit cavalier about references .",
    "our aim has been to provide mostly a ( not exhaustive ) list of reference for further reading .",
    "we apologize to those authors who feel misrepresented .",
    "* acknowlegments .",
    "* it is a great pleasure to thank the organizers of the cern - claf 2005 and 2009 schools , and in particular teresa dova , marta losada and enrico nardi , for the opportunity to present this material , and for the wonderful atmosphere they created during the schools .",
    "the work of m.a.v .- m . has been partially supported by spanish science ministry grants fpa2002 - 02037 , fpa2005 - 04823 and bfm2003 - 02121 .      before starting it is convenient to review the notation used . through these notes",
    "we will be using the metric @xmath0 .",
    "derivatives with respect to the four - vector @xmath1 will be denoted by the shorthand @xmath2 as usual space - time indices will be labelled by greek letters ( @xmath3 ) while latin indices will be used for spatial directions ( @xmath4 ) . in many expressions",
    "we will use the notation @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the pauli matrices @xmath7 sometimes we use of the feynman s slash notation @xmath8 . finally , unless stated otherwise , we work in natural units @xmath9 .",
    "in spite of the impressive success of quantum mechanics in describing atomic physics , it was immediately clear after its formulation that its relativistic extension was not free of difficulties .",
    "these problems were clear already to schrdinger , whose first guess for a wave equation of a free relativistic particle was the klein - gordon equation @xmath10 this equation follows directly from the relativistic `` mass - shell '' identity @xmath11 using the correspondence principle @xmath12    plane wave solutions to the wave equation ( [ kg ] ) are readily obtained @xmath13 in order to have a complete basis of functions , one must include plane wave with both @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that given the conserved current @xmath16 its time - component is @xmath17 and therefore does not define a positive - definite probability density .",
    "a complete , properly normalized , continuous basis of solutions of the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) labelled by the momentum @xmath18 can be defined as @xmath19 given the inner product @xmath20 the states ( [ basis ] ) form an orthonormal basis @xmath21    = 0.5truein    the wave functions @xmath22 describes states with momentum @xmath18 and energy given by @xmath23 . on the other hand , the states @xmath24 not only",
    "have a negative scalar product but they actually correspond to negative energy states @xmath25 therefore the energy spectrum of the theory satisfies @xmath26 and is unbounded from below ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "although in a case of a free theory the absence of a ground state is not necessarily a fatal problem , once the theory is coupled to the electromagnetic field this is the source of all kinds of disasters , since nothing can prevent the decay of any state by emission of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the problem of the instability of the `` first - quantized '' relativistic wave equation can be heuristically tackled in the case of spin-@xmath27 particles , described by the dirac equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are @xmath31 matrices @xmath32 with @xmath6 the pauli matrices , and the wave function",
    "@xmath33 has four components . the wave equation ( [ eq : dirac ] ) can be thought of as a kind of `` square root '' of the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) , since the latter can be obtained as @xmath34    an analysis of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dirac ] ) along the lines of the one presented above for the klein - gordon equation leads again to the existence of negative energy states and a spectrum unbounded from below as in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "dirac , however , solved the instability problem by pointing out that now the particles are fermions and therefore they are subject to pauli s exclusion principle . hence , each state in the spectrum can be occupied by at most one particle , so the states with @xmath35 can be made stable if we assume that _ all _ the negative energy states are filled .",
    "= 5.0truein    if dirac s idea restores the stability of the spectrum by introducing a stable vacuum where all negative energy states are occupied , the so - called dirac sea , it also leads directly to the conclusion that a single - particle interpretation of the dirac equation is not possible .",
    "indeed , a photon with enough energy ( @xmath36 ) can excite one of the electrons filling the negative energy states , leaving behind a `` hole '' in the dirac see ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dirac_sea ] ) .",
    "this hole behaves as a particle with equal mass and opposite charge that is interpreted as a positron , so there is no escape to the conclusion that interactions will produce pairs particle - antiparticle out of the vacuum .    in spite of the success of the heuristic interpretation of negative energy states in the dirac equation",
    "this is not the end of the story . in 1929",
    "oskar klein stumbled into an apparent paradox when trying to describe the scattering of a relativistic electron by a square potential using dirac s wave equation @xcite ( for pedagogical reviews see @xcite ) . in order to capture the essence of the problem without entering into unnecessary complication",
    "we will study klein s paradox in the context of the klein - gordon equation .",
    "= 5.0truein    let us consider a square potential with height @xmath37 of the type showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] . a solution to the wave equation in regions i and ii",
    "is given by @xmath38 where the mass - shell condition implies that @xmath39 the constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 are computed by matching the two solutions across the boundary @xmath42 . the conditions @xmath43 and @xmath44 imply that @xmath45    at first sight one would expect a behavior similar to the one encountered in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "if the kinetic energy is bigger than @xmath46 both a transmitted and reflected wave are expected , whereas when the kinetic energy is smaller than @xmath46 one only expect to find a reflected wave , the transmitted wave being exponentially damped within a distance of a compton wavelength inside the barrier .",
    "indeed this is what happens if @xmath47 . in this case",
    "both @xmath48 and @xmath49 are real and we have a partly reflected , and a partly transmitted wave . in the same way , if @xmath50 _ and _ @xmath51 then @xmath49 is imaginary and there is total reflection .",
    "however , in the case when @xmath52 and the energy is in the range @xmath53 a completely different situation arises",
    ". in this case one finds that both @xmath48 and @xmath49 are real and therefore the incoming wave function is partially reflected and partially transmitted across the barrier .",
    "this is a shocking result , since it implies that there is a nonvanishing probability of finding the particle at any point across the barrier with negative kinetic energy ( @xmath54 ) !",
    "this weird result is known as klein s paradox .    as with the negative energy states , the klein paradox results from our insistence in giving a single - particle interpretation to the relativistic wave function",
    "actually , a multiparticle analysis of the paradox @xcite shows that what happens when @xmath55 is that the reflection of the incoming particle by the barrier is accompanied by the creation of pairs particle - antiparticle out of the energy of the barrier ( notice that for this to happen it is required that @xmath52 , the threshold for the creation of a particle - antiparticle pair ) .",
    "actually , this particle creation can be understood by noticing that the sudden potential step in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] localizes the incoming particle with mass @xmath56 in distances smaller than its compton wavelength @xmath57 .",
    "this can be seen by replacing the square potential by another one where the potential varies smoothly from @xmath58 to @xmath52 in distances scales larger than @xmath59 .",
    "this case was worked out by sauter shortly after klein pointed out the paradox @xcite .",
    "he considered a situation where the regions with @xmath60 and @xmath61 are connected by a region of length @xmath62 with a linear potential @xmath63 .",
    "when @xmath64 he found that the transmission coefficient is exponentially small ) we will see how , in the case of the dirac field , this exponential behavior can be associated with the creation of electron - positron pairs due to a constant electric field ( schwinger effect ) . ] .",
    "the creation of particles is impossible to avoid whenever one tries to locate a particle of mass @xmath56 within its compton wavelength .",
    "indeed , from heisenberg uncertainty relation we find that if @xmath65 , the fluctuations in the momentum will be of order @xmath66 and fluctuations in the energy of order @xmath67 can be expected .",
    "therefore , in a relativistic theory , the fluctuations of the energy are enough to allow the creation of particles out of the vacuum . in the case of a spin-@xmath68 particle ,",
    "the dirac sea picture shows clearly how , when the energy fluctuations are of order @xmath56 , electrons from the dirac sea can be excited to positive energy states , thus creating electron - positron pairs .    = 3.5truein    it is possible to see how the multiparticle interpretation is forced upon us by relativistic invariance . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics observables",
    "are represented by self - adjoint operator that in the heisenberg picture depend on time .",
    "therefore measurements are localized in time but are global in space .",
    "the situation is radically different in the relativistic case .",
    "because no signal can propagate faster than the speed of light , measurements have to be localized both in time and space .",
    "causality demands then that two measurements carried out in causally - disconnected regions of space - time can not interfere with each other . in mathematical terms",
    "this means that if @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the observables associated with two measurements localized in two causally - disconnected regions @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : causal ] ) , they satisfy @xmath73=0 , \\hspace*{1 cm } \\mbox{if $ ( x_{1}-x_{2})^2<0 $ , for all $ x_1\\in r_{1}$ , $ x_{2}\\in r_{2}$}. \\label{commutator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hence , in a relativistic theory , the basic operators in the heisenberg picture must depend on the space - time position @xmath74 .",
    "unlike the case in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , here the position @xmath75 _ is not _ an observable , but just a label , similarly to the case of time in ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "causality is then imposed microscopically by requiring @xmath76=0 , \\hspace*{1 cm } \\mbox{if $ ( x - y)^2<0$}. \\label{microcausality}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a smeared operator @xmath77 over a space - time region @xmath40 can then be defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the characteristic function associated with @xmath40 , @xmath80 eq .",
    "( [ commutator ] ) follows now from the microcausality condition ( [ microcausality ] )",
    ".    therefore , relativistic invariance forces the introduction of quantum fields .",
    "it is only when we insist in keeping a single - particle interpretation that we crash against causality violations . to illustrate the point ,",
    "let us consider a single particle wave function @xmath33 that initially is localized in the position @xmath81 @xmath82 evolving this wave function using the hamiltonian @xmath83 we find that the wave function can be written as @xmath84 integrating over the angular variables , the wave function can be recast in the form @xmath85 the resulting integral can be evaluated using the complex integration contour @xmath86 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] .",
    "the result is that , for any @xmath87 , one finds that @xmath88 for any @xmath75 .",
    "if we insist in interpreting the wave function @xmath33 as the probability density of finding the particle at the location @xmath75 in the time @xmath89 we find that the probability leaks out of the light cone , thus violating causality .",
    "we have learned how the consistency of quantum mechanics with special relativity forces us to abandon the single - particle interpretation of the wave function . instead we have to consider quantum fields whose elementary excitations are associated with particle states , as we will see below .    in any scattering experiment ,",
    "the only information available to us is the set of quantum number associated with the set of free particles in the initial and final states .",
    "ignoring for the moment other quantum numbers like spin and flavor , one - particle states are labelled by the three - momentum @xmath18 and span the single - particle hilbert space @xmath90 @xmath91 the states @xmath92 form a basis of @xmath90 and therefore satisfy the closure relation @xmath93 the group of spatial rotations acts unitarily on the states @xmath94 .",
    "this means that for every rotation @xmath95 there is a unitary operator @xmath96 such that @xmath97 where @xmath98 represents the action of the rotation on the vector @xmath99 , @xmath100 . using a spectral decomposition ,",
    "the momentum operator @xmath101 can be written as @xmath102 with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq : transformation ] ) it is straightforward to check that the momentum operator transforms as a vector under rotations : @xmath103 where we have used that the integration measure is invariant under so@xmath104 .",
    "since , as we argued above , we are forced to deal with multiparticle states , it is convenient to introduce creation - annihilation operators associated with a single - particle state of momentum @xmath18 @xmath105=\\delta(\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}\\ , ' ) , \\hspace*{1 cm } [ a(\\vec{p}),a(\\vec{p}\\,')]= [ a^{\\dagger}(\\vec{p}),a^{\\dagger}(\\vec{p}\\,')]=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that the state @xmath94 is created out of the fock space vacuum @xmath106 ( normalized such that @xmath107 ) by the action of a creation operator @xmath108 @xmath109    covariance under spatial rotations is all we need if we are interested in a nonrelativistic theory . however in a relativistic quantum field theory we must preserve more that so@xmath104 , actually we need the expressions to be covariant under the full poincar group iso@xmath110 consisting in spatial rotations , boosts and space - time translations . therefore , in order to build the fock space of the theory we need two key ingredients : first an invariant normalization for the states , since we want a normalized state in one reference frame to be normalized in any other inertial frame . and secondly a relativistic invariant integration measure in momentum space ,",
    "so the spectral decomposition of operators is covariant under the full poincar group .",
    "let us begin with the invariant measure .",
    "given an invariant function @xmath111 of the four - momentum @xmath112 of a particle of mass @xmath56 with positive energy @xmath113 , there is an integration measure which is invariant under proper lorentz transformations are introduced for later convenience . ]",
    "@xmath114 where @xmath115 represent the heaviside step function .",
    "the integration over @xmath116 can be easily done using the @xmath117-function identity @xmath118=\\sum_{x_i={\\rm zeros\\,\\,of\\,\\,}f}{1\\over |f'(x_{i})| } \\delta(x - x_{i } ) , \\label{eq : delta_identity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which in our case implies that @xmath119 the second term in the previous expression correspond to states with negative energy and therefore does not contribute to the integral .",
    "we can write then @xmath120 hence , the relativistic invariant measure is given by @xmath121    once we have an invariant measure the next step is to find an invariant normalization for the states .",
    "we work with a basis @xmath122 of eigenstates of the four - momentum operator @xmath123 @xmath124 since the states @xmath125 are eigenstates of the three - momentum operator we can express them in terms of the non - relativistic states @xmath94 that we introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonrelativistic_states ] ) @xmath126 with @xmath127 a normalization to be determined now . the states",
    "@xmath128 form a complete basis , so they should satisfy the lorentz invariant closure relation @xmath129 at the same time , this closure relation can be expressed , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : normalization ] ) , in terms of the nonrelativistic basis of states @xmath92 as @xmath130 ) for the nonrelativistic states , expression ( [ eq : closure_r ] ) follows provided @xmath131 ) so that @xmath132 is real , we define the lorentz invariant states @xmath125 as latexmath:[\\ ] ] which proves that @xmath1353 $ ] and therefore @xmath1356 whenever the representation is real or pseudoreal .",
    "since the gauge anomaly in four dimensions is proportional to @xmath1352 this means that anomalies appear only when the fermions transform in a complex representation of the gauge group .",
