    "the classification of topological phases of matter is increasingly well understood  @xcite .",
    "we now know that , in addition to states with _",
    "intrinsic _ topological order  @xcite  which can not be smoothly connected to any local product state  @xcite  there are those that exhibit a weaker form of topological order .",
    "these so - called _ symmetry protected topological _ ( spt ) states  @xcite are also incompatible with any local - product - state description , but only insofar as a special protecting symmetry remains unbroken .",
    "spt states are gapped and featureless in the bulk , and they are short - range entangled .",
    "they share few of the exotic features of their intrinsically ordered cousins .",
    "for instance , they do not support fractional excitations  @xcite , nor do they possess topological ground - state degeneracy  @xcite ( i.e. , they have unique ground states on closed manifolds ) .",
    "nonetheless , nontrivial spt states do possess interesting boundary modes , which in low - dimensional systems must either be gapless or spontaneously break a symmetry .",
    "( beginning in three spatial dimensions , topologically degenerate boundary modes offer a third possibility  @xcite . ) in general , the wave function at the boundary admits projective representations of the protecting symmetries .",
    "the haldane chain is a well - known example of an spt state in one dimension , where the spin-1 degrees of freedom in the bulk fractionalize into spin-1/2 at the boundary  @xcite ; there , the projective representations are su(2 ) in the case of so(3 ) symmetry and @xmath2 in the case of time reversal symmetry .",
    "the concept of spt phases was first developed in the context of noninteracting fermions , and an exhaustive classification  @xcite was soon worked out following the discovery of topological insulators . in the presence of interactions , however , the story is more complicated .",
    "for example , in the case of spinless fermions in one dimension with time - reversal invariance and particle - number conservation , interactions reduce the group structure from @xmath3 down to @xmath4  @xcite ; for bosons , the group structure must enlarge , since noninteracting bosons ultimately condense into a single phase .",
    "there is ongoing work to classify spt phases for general interacting quantum systems . for fermions ,",
    "there is a proposal to apply group supercohomology theory  @xcite .",
    "classification of interacting bosonic systems has been attempted using group cohomology  @xcite and nonlinear @xmath5 models augmented by topological @xmath6 terms  @xcite .",
    "much progress has been made already in the special case of one spatial dimension , where gapped spt phases can be described by matrix product states  @xcite and their characterization given by a generalization of string order .",
    "but in two or more dimensions , string order is ill - defined , and such a classification scheme is not possible .",
    "some promising approaches include universal signatures in the entanglement spectrum  @xcite and the braiding statistics of topological excitations in the corresponding `` gauged '' intrinsic topological state  @xcite .",
    "recent proposals extend to the geometric properties of reduced density matrices  @xcite and the analysis of modular matrices  @xcite .",
    "however , these approaches are computationally costly and impractical outside of exact diagonalization , density matrix renormalization group , matrix product state , and tensor network methods .    an intriguing alternative has been suggested by you _",
    "_ , who introduced a `` strange correlator '' that effectively maps spatiotemporal correlations at the physical boundary of an spt phase to spatial correlations at a temporal boundary with a trivial symmetric product state  @xcite . because the modes at the physical boundary are either gapless or degenerate , in one and two dimensions they must be either critical or ordered ( because of spontaneous symmetry breaking at the boundary ) .",
    "thus , the strange correlator will show exponential decay for trivial symmetric states but long - range or power - law behavior for nontrivial spt states .",
    "this understanding has been confirmed in studies of affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) states in one and two dimensions  @xcite , spin-1 heisenberg chains and ladders  @xcite , quasi - one - dimensional arrays of haldane chains  @xcite , and quantum spin hall states in the kane - mele - hubbard model  @xcite .    the basic idea of the strange correlator is to map the imaginary - time green s function of a spatial boundary onto the equal - time green s function of a space - time boundary  @xcite .",
    "as long as there exists an emergent lorentz symmetry in the low - energy effective field theory of the spt phase ( i.e. , the dynamical critical exponent @xmath7 ) , then this mapping is in principle exact .",
    "since the boundary modes of an spt are either gapless or degenerate , in one and two dimensions this implies that the green s function must show either long - range order ( lro ) or quasi - long - range order ( qlro ) . in three dimensions , the possibility of a topologically ordered boundary mode introduces the possibility of short - range order ( sro ) .",
    "thus , in one and two dimensions , lro or qlro signal a nontrivial spt phase , while sro signals a symmetric product state . in three dimensions , lro and qlro still signal a nontrivial spt phase , but sro no longer implies a symmetric product state unless it can be shown that the boundary is topologically trivial .    in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate how to measure the strange correlator within a generalized spin-@xmath0 valence bond formalism and apply this method to study aklt states in one , two , and three dimensions .",
    "the aklt states are exact valence bond solid states with well - known properties , and we employ them as a testbed for methods to characterize spt states .",
    "in one dimension our approach provides an intuitive and easy - to - visualize picture of why the strange correlator yields long - range correlations in spin-@xmath0 aklt chains for odd values of @xmath0 .",
    "it also makes clear a connection to the concept of valence bond winding number sectors , as well as to the conventional string order in one - dimensional systems . in two dimensions",
    "the strange correlator becomes quasi - long - range , yet we show that the corresponding winding number fraction remains finite .",
    "this is reminiscent of the kosterlitz - thouless phase , where slow twisting of the superfluid order parameter prevents bose - einstein condensation at finite temperature , yet there still exists a finite superfluid fraction due to vortex confinement .",
    "finally , in three dimensions we show the strange correlator is long - range with a nonzero winding number fraction .    the remainder of the text proceeds as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : method ] we introduce aklt states as the exact ground states of a class of projective hamiltonians .",

    "this mapping holds in any dimension and implies , via the mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite , that all aklt states in one and two dimensions are magnetically disordered . in 3d ,",

    "( a ) @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to the same loop with an odd number of valence bonds connecting them . after the update ,",
    "they remain in the same loop while the two untouched segments ( red dashed lines ) retain their internal structure , but pick up an odd factor in their relative ordering .",
    "( b ) @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to the same loop with an even number of valence bonds connecting them . after the update ,",
    "the loop is split so that @xmath260 and @xmath261 no longer belong to the same loop . in the reverse update ,",

    "next , if @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to the same loop , this loop will either remain intact or split in two , depending on the `` loop distance '' ( call this @xmath276 ) between @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "if @xmath276 is even , the loop splits in two , and @xmath278 .",
    "if @xmath276 is odd , the loop remains intact and @xmath277 .",
    "note that the loop update rules are the opposite of the singlet projection operator for the case where @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to the same loop .    combining the prefactors of the singlet projection operator ( 1/2 or 1 depending on whether or not @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to different singlets ) with the above determined loop weights , we obtain the total weights for singlet projection operator updates as follows :    * if @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to different loops , then combine the loops with probability 1/4 . *",
    "if @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to the same loop with even loop spacing , then split the loops with probability 1 . *",
    "if @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to the same loop with odd loop spacing , then keep the reordered loop with probability 1/2 .      in a symmetrization update ,",
    "we wish to symmetrize over all possible relabelings of the on - site flavor components .",
    "this entails randomly picking a pair of flavors on a given site ( call them @xmath260 and @xmath261 ) , then exchanging their labels .",
    "this update is related to the parity operator update , but in this case the factor of @xmath262 that comes from acting on a state with @xmath271 will drop out in the detailed balance equation ; only the weight associated with loop rearrangements survives .",
    "( equivalently , we can consider symmetrization updates as acting upon the current state with an operator @xmath280 . ) as discussed above , one of three possible rearrangements will occur .",
    "this time , their total probabilities are as follows :    * if @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to different loops , then combine the loops with probability 1/2 . *",
    "if @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to the same loop with even loop spacing , then split the loops with probability 1 ( relative weight is 2 ) . *",
    "if @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to the same loop with odd loop spacing , then keep the reordered loop with probability 1 .",
    "thus , to construct the symmetrization updates appears to be quite simple .",
    "just choose some @xmath260 and @xmath261 , then use @xmath281 to reorder the valence bond pattern with probability @xmath282 given by the above list . since @xmath282 depends on whether or not @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to the same loop , at first glance it appears that we have to keep a record of all loops . actually ,",
    "this is not the case , and we can in fact form a `` fast '' update that does not need to keep track of loop memberships during the course of the update . the trick is to take advantage of the bipartite nature of valence bonds and construct a pseudospin degree of freedom that is attached to each sublattice ( say , `` up '' on a and `` down '' on b ) , but within a given loop these pseudospins are flipped with probability 1/2 . then we accept an update if and only if the pseudospin of @xmath260 matches the pseudospin of @xmath261 .",
    "if @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to the same loop , then since they belong to the same sublattice their pseudospins must match and we always accept this update ( in agreement with the probability list given above ) .",
    "however , if @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to different loops , then their relative pseudospins are randomized and will only match 1/2 the time , and we end up accepting this type of move with probability 1/2 ( again in agreement with the probability list given above ) .",
    "the fast updates described above can alternatively be formulated in the combined space of the valence bond basis and @xmath283 component spin basis . as discussed by sandvik and evertz  @xcite",
    ", this basis can be formed by considering the possible @xmath283 configurations on top of the valence bond configurations .",
    "since all overlap graphs in the valence bond basis considered in this work form systems of closed loops , the only allowed @xmath283 configurations consist of alternating up and down spins within a loop . in general , the pattern of up and down spins between separate loops do not need to agree , and it is easy to see that this combined picture provides a physical motivation for the pseudospin degree of freedom introduced in the fast updates described above .",
    "sandvik and evertz only considered pure valence bond overlap graphs ( i.e. , they did not consider the type of internal triplet states we consider in this work for the calculation of the strange correlator ) , so here we show that overlaps between the internal triplet state and an arbitrary valence bond state produce the pseudospin pattern described above .    to derive the appropriate pseudospin pattern used in the fast updates , it is convenient to write the internal triplet state as a product state in the @xmath284 basis : @xmath285 for spin @xmath9",
    ", the on - site state @xmath286 can be written in terms of the spin-1/2 degrees of freedom projected along the @xmath21 axis as @xmath287 so that the @xmath288 pattern within each closed loop will contain a pseudospin pattern of either @xmath289 or @xmath290 . for higher spin",
    ", we simply form the symmetric combination of @xmath0 pairs in the @xmath291 state listed above . thus",
    ", our internal triplet state can only be formed for _ integral _ @xmath0 . in general",
    ", the loops formed in the overlap graph state between these internal triplet states and an arbitrary valence bond configuration will always obey an @xmath288 pattern , and the form of the internal triplet state described above allows for two possible spin arrangements in the @xmath292 basis : @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
    "hence , the pseudospin update can also be applied to calculations of the strange correlator and represents a generalization of the fast updates in the combined bond - spin space described by sandvik and evertz  @xcite .",
    "the above rules for loop updates may also be used to construct rules for measuring spin correlation functions .",
    "they can be summarized by the following formula for spin flavors @xmath260 and @xmath261 : @xmath293 where @xmath294 is a @xmath123 function that triggers when @xmath260 and @xmath261 are in the same loop , while @xmath263 and @xmath264 are the sites hosting the spin flavors @xmath260 and @xmath261 , respectively . as in the main text , @xmath295 for @xmath263 and @xmath264 on the same ( @xmath120 ) or opposite ( @xmath121 ) sublattices , and @xmath296 for @xmath260 and @xmath261 with even ( @xmath120 ) or odd ( @xmath121 ) loop distance .    for valence bond overlaps in the singlet sector ,",
    "the @xmath16 pattern within each loop guarantees that when @xmath263 and @xmath264 belong to the same ( opposite ) sublattice , their loop spacing is even ( odd ) .",
    "thus , the above formula reduces to @xmath297 this is the standard formula for spin correlations in the valence bond basis . beach and sandvik",
    "have extended this to the case of four - spin correlations  @xcite , @xmath298.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here , @xmath299 triggers only if @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to the same loop _",
    "after _ acting on the overlap graph with @xmath300 .",
    "since the operation of @xmath300 may merge , rearrange , or split existing loops , this is @xmath123 function is distinct from the unprimed one .",
    "for mixed overlap states , a more general relation can be derived : @xmath301 \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{16}\\bigl(2\\epsilon_{i_{\\mu},j_{\\nu}}+\\lambda'_{\\mu\\leftrightarrow\\nu}\\bigr)\\bigl(2\\epsilon_{k_{\\sigma},l_{\\tau}}+\\lambda_{\\sigma\\leftrightarrow\\tau}\\bigr)\\delta'_{\\mu\\leftrightarrow\\nu}\\delta_{\\sigma\\leftrightarrow\\tau}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] again , the prime indicates the values in the updated configuration obtained by acting @xmath300 on the overlap graph .",
    "this simplifies to the normal relation whenever @xmath302 .",
    "when the flavors @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to opposite sublattices , we can decompose the spin correlations as @xmath303 .",
    "since we already know the weights of @xmath304 , we can easily determine the weights of @xmath305 :    * if @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to different loops , then @xmath306 . * if @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to the same loop with even loop spacing , then @xmath307 .",
    "* if @xmath260 and @xmath261 belong to the same loop with odd loop spacing , then @xmath308 .",
