    "the observed staggering of energy levels in atomic nuclei requires a theory that goes beyond mean - field considerations @xcite .",
    "staggering data contain detailed information about the properties of the nucleonic interaction and suggest the existence of high - order correlations in the collective dynamics .",
    "most studies of staggering focus on two aspects of the phenomena .",
    "there are discrete angular momentum dependent oscillations of physical observables ; namely , of @xmath6 transitions in nuclei @xcite or of the energy levels themselves ( e.g. , in octupole @xcite , superdeformed @xcite , ground and @xmath7 @xcite bands in atomic nuclei , as well as in molecular rotational bands @xcite ) .",
    "and then there are sawtooth patterns of different physical quantities ( most commonly binding energies ) that track with changes in the number of particles in a system ( both in nuclei @xcite and in metallic clusters @xcite ) .    in nuclear structure physics , staggering behavior of the second type",
    "is observed when one changes in a systematic way the usual nuclear characteristics such as proton ( @xmath8 ) , neutron ( @xmath9 ) , mass ( @xmath10 ) or isospin projection ( @xmath11 ) numbers .",
    "examples of these nuclear phenomena include odd - even mass staggering ( oems ) @xcite , odd - even staggering in isotope / isotone shifts @xcite , and zigzag patterns of the first excited @xmath12 state energies in even - even nuclei @xcite .",
    "the staggering behavior of a nuclear observable is most easily seen when discrete derivatives of second or higher order in its variable(s ) are considered . the aim of this approach is to filter out the strong mean - field ( global ) effects and in so doing reveal weaker specific features . in this way , for example",
    ", the oems , which is usually attributed to the nuclear pairing correlations , manifests itself in certain finite differences of the binding energies that can provide for a measure of the empirical pairing gap @xcite .",
    "likewise , various discrete approximation of derivatives ( filters ) of the binding energies can be considered to investigate detailed properties of the nuclear structure @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the binding energies of the @xmath1 ground states of even-@xmath10 nuclei in the mass range @xmath13 , and for the rest odd - odd nuclei with a ( @xmath14 ) ground state , the energy of the lowest isobaric analog @xmath1 excited state ( which corresponds to the ground state of the even - even neighbor )",

    "our aim is to investigate how various , comparatively small but not insignificant , parts of the interaction between nucleons influence these states when we consider higher - order discrete derivatives of their energies within the framework of a convenient systematics .",

    "different types of discrete derivatives are considered and various staggering patterns are investigated in the following sections .",
    "the corresponding components of the interaction isolated through the energy difference filters can be explained in analogous ways as in @xcite , in addition to the advantage that because they are free of coulomb effect they reflect phenomena related only to nuclear forces .",
    "for even - even nuclei , the discrete approximation of the @xmath156 first derivative of the binding energies ( including the coulomb repulsion energy ) is related to the well - known two - proton ( two - neutron ) separation energy , which is usually defined as @xmath157 [ see figure  [ nis2p](a ) for a relation to proton number and figure  [ nis2p](b ) for the difference of the coulomb corrected energies @xmath117 versus neutron number ] .",

    "these nuclei are not yet explored as seen in figure  [ nis2p ] and an experimental comparison for the two - proton - drip line is expected to be soon possible due to radioactive beam experiments near the limits of stability . yet , the findings of our model are in close agreement with the results of other theoretical predictions @xcite . particularly , the estimate for the two - proton separation energies in @xcite confirms the division in nuclides such that the isotones with lower / higher @xmath8 values than the nuclei in ( [ dripline ] ) have positive / negative @xmath161 energies ( compare to figure  [ nis2p ] ) .",

    "= 3.5 in    as a whole , the higher - order derivatives with respect to proton ( neutron ) number have a smooth behavior .",

    "the discretization of the @xmath175 second - order derivative , @xmath176 [ @xmath177 ( [ stag_m ] ) ] , accounts for the interaction between the last two @xmath43 ( @xmath48 ) pairs in the ( @xmath178 ) nucleus ( figure [ nider2npvpn](a ) ) .",

    "another smaller peak is observed around midshell ( figure [ nider2npvpn](a ) ) , which is due to the particle - hole discontinuity introduced in the pairing theory .",
    "the analysis yields that as a whole the @xmath28 model reproduces the fine structure effects in interactions isolated via the @xmath182 filters .",
    "another aspect of the nuclear interaction is revealed by the second - order discrete mixed derivative of the energy @xcite , @xmath183 ( [ stag_2_mixed ] ) . for even - even nuclei",
    "it was found to represent the residual interaction between the last proton and the last neutron @xcite and it was empirically approximated by @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "the theoretical discrete derivative ( figure  [ nider2npvpn](b ) ) agrees remarkably well with the experiment @xcite , especially in reproducing the typical behavior at @xmath160 , and is consistent with the empirical trend ( on average , @xmath185 for @xmath114 and @xmath186 for the major shell above the @xmath131 core ) .",
    "it is well - known that the attractive peak in the self - conjugate nuclei can not be described by a model with an isovector interaction only @xcite and in this respect our model achieves this result due to the additional terms included in the hamiltonian , mainly the symmetry term ( figure [ ca_cmp ] ) .",
    "the @xmath187 energy difference provides for a powerful test for the symplectic model : the theory not only gives a thorough description of the isovector @xmath3 and like - particle pairing but additionally accounts for @xmath188 components of the @xmath3 interaction in a consistent way with the experiment . as a result the model can be used to provide for a reasonable prediction of @xmath187 of proton - rich exotic nuclei as well as odd - odd nuclei .",
    "the @xmath28 classification scheme can also be used to investigate energy differences with respect to the total number of particles @xmath22 and their isospin projection @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , in contrast with the typical smooth behavior observed for discrete derivatives with respect to @xmath74 and @xmath70 that was highlighted in the preceding section , the derivatives with respect to @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the ones that reveal distinct staggering effects .",

    "according to the @xmath28 model , the @xmath191 staggering patterns appear due to the discontinuous change of the seniority numbers driven by the @xmath16 pairing interaction @xcite .",
    "even values of the seniority quantum number ( @xmath55 ) in even - even nuclei and odd values for odd - odd nuclei lead to a change in @xmath3 and like - particle pairing energies in opposite directions . after the contribution from the isovector pairing energy",
    "is taken away , the theoretical staggering amplitude , @xmath248 , has still a ( typically large ) component from the remaining @xmath249 interactions in the hamiltonian ( [ clh ] ) , mainly the symmetry ( @xmath250 ) term [ figure [ cahterms ] , long - dashed ( purple ) line with squares ] .",
    "this is the same nonmonopole nuclear interaction , @xmath251 , that was suggested in ( [ stg2i_int_i0 ] ) and ( [ stg2i_int ] ) using phenomenological arguments .",
    "indeed , the symmetry energy contribution is significant and nonzero in all nuclei but the odd - odd @xmath5 ( [ clh ] ) ( figure [ cahterms ] ) , which is consistent with the discussion above [ ( [ stg2igap ] ) , ( [ stg2i_int_i0 ] ) , ( [ stg2i_int ] ) ] . also , an estimation of the pairing gaps is possible based on the examination of the model hamiltonian but the theoretical staggering amplitudes of the @xmath16 pairing energies ( shown in figure [ cahterms ] ) need to be rescaled in accordance with ( [ stg2igap ] ) , ( [ stg2i_int_i0 ] ) and ( [ stg2i_int ] ) .    in a way analogous to that used in ( [ stg2i_int ] ) , the second - order discrete derivative with respect to @xmath22 ( can be compared to the filter used in @xcite ) @xmath252 is related to the pairing gap relation @xmath253 where in the odd - odd case , for example , @xmath247 is the non - pair interaction of the last two protons with the last two neutrons in the ( @xmath205 ) nucleus .",
    "the effects due to @xmath224 can not be isolated via ( [ stg2n_int ] ) because of the additional nonzero contribution due to the symmetry energy .",
    "however , the staggering amplitude of the discrete derivative ( [ stg2n ] ) , @xmath254 , of the theoretical total , @xmath43 ( @xmath48 ) and @xmath3 pairing energies can provide for estimation of the pairing gaps @xmath224 , @xmath255 and @xmath256 , respectively [ figure [ canigaps](a ) ] .",
    "the like - particle pairing gap can be compared to the empirical value of @xmath257 @xcite [ solid ( purple ) line ] .",
    "the gap is smaller in odd - odd nuclei as compared to their even - even neighbors .",
    "this is a consequence of a decrease in the like - particle pairing energy in the odd - odd nuclei due to the blocking effect while there is an increase in energy due to the @xmath3 pairing .",
    "the @xmath3 isovector pairing gap increases toward @xmath213 and eventually gets almost equal to @xmath258 for odd - odd nuclei around the @xmath5 region , which is in agreement with the discussion of @xcite .",
    "= 3.55 in    furthermore , an average of the additional non - pair interaction is achieved by the fourth - order derivatives both in @xmath22 [ @xmath259 and @xmath23 [ @xmath260 @xmath261 assuming that the @xmath3 pairing gap is negligible for high-@xmath23 nuclei in large shells like the @xmath115 major shell , the gap relation ( [ stg4i_int ] ) or ( [ stg4n_int ] ) provides for a rough estimation of the like - particle pairing gaps . with the use of the model hamiltonian ( [ clh ] )",
    "we can estimate the additional @xmath247 interaction with the major input being the symmetry energy .",
    "although the existence of a very small mixing of isospin values complicates the computation of the symmetry energy for nuclear systems with very large interaction matrices , as a very good approximation one may use @xmath262 with isospin values @xmath263 for even - even nuclei and @xmath264 for odd - odd nuclei .",
    "once the fourth - order discrete derivative ( [ stag_m ] ) of the approximated symmetry energy is removed from @xmath265 ( [ stg4i_int ] ) , the like - particle pairing gaps @xmath266 are found to be in a very good agreement with the experimental approximation of @xmath267 for the ( @xmath268 ) multiplets in the @xmath115 major shell ( figure [ canigaps](b ) ) . for lower @xmath269 values the difference increases due to an increase in the @xmath3 pairing gap as mentioned above . as a whole , the agreement would not be possible if the significant energy contribution due to the symmetry energy was not taken into account .",
    "next we consider the second - order discrete mixed derivative of the relevant energies with respect to the total number @xmath22 and the third projection @xmath23 @xmath270 where in addition to the pairing gaps relation , @xmath224 , there is the contribution due to the nonpairing interaction , @xmath251 .",
    "for example , for the odd - odd \\{even - even } case it is the positive \\{negative } nonpairing average interaction between the last three protons \\{neutrons } in the ( @xmath205 @xmath271 ) nucleus with a ( @xmath272 ) core . within the @xmath28 framework the additional nonpairing contribution corresponds to the staggering of the symmetry energy approximation , @xmath273 , of @xmath274 .",
    "= 3.55 in    the filter ( [ stg2ni ] ) isolates fine structure effects between two @xmath23 multiplets [ figure  [ dernt](a ) ] and two consecutive isobaric sequences [ figure  [ dernt](b ) ] .",
    "clearly , it reveals a @xmath275 symmetric oscillating pattern as it is observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "its positive ( negative ) value is centered at even - even ( odd - odd ) nuclei and its amplitude increases ( decreases ) with @xmath269 .",
    "this mixed discrete derivative ( [ stg2ni ] ) serves as another test for the @xmath28 model and allows for a detailed investigation of the nonpairing , like - particle interactions involved .    to isolate the effect of nonpairing interactions ( again",
    ", it is understood to order @xmath276 ) , an energy difference with respect to both @xmath277 and @xmath23 can be considered .",
    "the second discrete derivative of the energy @xmath278 represents the negative \\{positive } nonpairing two - body interaction of the last two neutrons \\{protons } with a proton and a neutron in the ( @xmath279 ) nucleus .",
    "it shows prominent @xmath194 staggering patterns for different @xmath23 multiplets ( figure  [ nidernptau0 ] ) . while in the framework of the @xmath28 model its amplitude",
    "does not depend on @xmath277 and @xmath23 except for irregularities around the mid - shell , the magnitude of the few experimental values @xcite ( where data exist ) tends to be slightly lower away from the closed shell . as a whole ,",
    "the results show that the staggering behavior of this interaction is due to the fine structure features in the relationship between the like - particle and @xmath3 nonpairing interactions and differs between proton - rich and neutron - rich nuclei .    regarding ( [ stg2npi ] ) and the other discrete approximations of the derivatives in section [ derstg ] , it is clear that the oscillating patterns that exist and their regular appearance throughout the nuclear chart can not be a simple artifact due to errors in the experimental or theoretical energies .",
    "even more , the staggering amplitudes are usually ( very ) large compared to the energy uncertainties .",
    "for all the discrete derivatives that we have investigated above and that show ",
    "@xmath189-@xmath190 \" staggering behavior , the discontinuity of the symmetry term ( due to discrete changes in the isospin value ) plays an important role . in contrast ,",
    "when these discrete derivatives include states of odd - odd nuclei with a dominant @xmath17 @xmath3 coupling there is a constant or no contribution due to the symmetry energy , and hence yield patterns of different shapes and interpretations .",
    "our investigation does not aim to account for such effects .",
    "it is focused on the @xmath191 staggering behavior of the @xmath117 energies of the lowest _ isovector - paired _ states as observed from the experimental data and reproduced remarkably well by the @xmath28 model .",
    "a dynamical @xmath28 symmetry was used to provide for a natural classification scheme of nuclei and to describe isovector pairing correlations and high-@xmath4 interactions . in a previous study @xcite",

    "the @xmath0 algebraic approach has been further tested through second- and higher - order discrete derivatives of the energies of the lowest _ isovector - paired _ @xmath1 states in the @xmath28 systematics , without any parameter variation .",
    "if reality were only a mean - field theory , none of the finite energy differences would reveal regular or irregular staggering effects .",
    "the reason is that any effect due to a smoothly varying mean - field part of the nuclear interaction is either entirely cancelled out in a finite energy difference filter or contributes regularly to the isolated part of the interaction .",
    "indeed , the results obtained show that this is not the case and staggering behavior is observed .",
    "the theoretical discrete derivatives investigated not only followed the experimental patterns but their magnitude was found to be in a remarkable agreement with the data .",
    "the proposed model successfully interpreted the following : the two - proton ( two - neutron ) separation energy @xmath280 ( hence determined the two - proton drip line ) for even - even nuclei , the @xmath202 energy difference when a @xmath3 @xmath16 pair is added , the observed irregularities around @xmath5 , the prominent @xmath191 staggering when even - even and odd - odd nuclides are considered simultaneously , the like - particle and @xmath3 isovector pairing gaps , and the large contribution to the finite energy differences due to the symmetry term .",
    "the oscillating effects , where observed , were found to develop due to the discontinuity of the seniority numbers for the @xmath3 and like - particle isovector pairing , which is in addition to the larger staggering due to the discontinuous change in isospin values ( symmetry term ) between even - even and odd - odd nuclei .",
    "we found a finite energy difference that , for a specific case , can be interpreted as an isovector pairing gap , @xmath281 , which is related to the like - particle and @xmath3 isovector pairing gaps .",
    "they correspond to the @xmath16 pairing mode because we do not consider the binding energies for all the nuclei but the respective isobaric analog @xmath1 states for the odd - odd nuclei with a @xmath282 ground state .",
    "this investigation is the first of its kind .",
    "moreover , the relevant energies are corrected for the coulomb interaction and therefore the isolated effects reflect solely the nature of the nuclear interaction .",
    "the outcome of this investigation shows that , in comparison to the experiment , the simple @xmath28 model reproduces not only global trends of the relevant energies but as well the smaller fine structure effects driven by isovector pairing correlations and higher-@xmath4 @xmath3 and like - particle nuclear interactions . in particular , the @xmath0 algebraic model was used to interpret specific phenomena revealed in finite energy differences and to investigate the contribution of the underlying interactions . in this way",
    ", it provides for an estimation of the isovector pairing gaps . for @xmath5 odd - odd nuclei all three pairing gaps",
    "were found equal while the @xmath3 pairing was found to weaken relative to the like - particle pairing strengths with increasing proton ( neutron ) excess .",
    "the like - particle pairing gaps were found to be in a good agreement with the empirical value of @xmath283 . additionally , the discrete derivatives give insight into particular small parts of the various non-(@xmath284 ) interactions , mainly into the detailed contribution of the interaction related to the @xmath18 term ( symmetry energy ) .",
