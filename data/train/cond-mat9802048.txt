    "the problem of diffusion limited aggregation ( dla)@xcite has been a subject of extensive research for the past decade and a half .",
    "this model produces highly ramified and non smooth patterns which seem to be fractal @xcite .",
    "these patterns have a great resemblance to those which are formed in many natural growth phenomena , such as viscous fingering @xcite , dielectric breakdown @xcite and many more .",
    "a good understanding of the dla model should help us to explain the essential physics of these processes .      in dla",
    "there is a seed cluster of particles fixed somewhere ; a particle is then released at a distance from it .",
    "this particle diffuses until it attempts to penetrate the fixed cluster , in which case it gets stuck and the next particle is released . in this way",
    "the cluster grows .",
    "simulations have shown that dla clusters form fractal branches .",
    "it has been shown that dla is equivalent to the dielectric breakdown model ( dbm ) with @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this paper analyzes the dbm model .",
    "dbm is a cellular automaton which is defined on a lattice .",
    "it consists of the following steps : one starts with a seed cluster of connected sites and with a boundary surface far away from it .",
    "a field @xmath3 , which corresponds to the electrostatic potential , is found by solving the discrete laplace equation on a lattice , @xmath4 it is believed that the laplace equation plays a crucial role in producing fractals in many physical cases , because it has no length scale and because of its long range screening qualities .",
    "these growth processes are called laplacian @xcite . in order to solve this equation",
    "the boundary conditions must be specified .",
    "the aggregate is considered to have a constant potential which is usually set to zero .",
    "the potential gradient on the distant boundary is set to one in some arbitrary units .",
    "after solving the discrete laplace equation ( [ laplace ] ) we use the field @xmath3 to determine the manner in which the cluster continues to grow .",
    "the growth process is stochastic and the growth probabilities per perimeter bond are determined by the local values of the electric field , equal to the potential difference across each bond , i.e. to the potential value at the sites lying across the perimeter bonds : @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the bond index , and @xmath1 is a parameter .",
    "one of the perimeter bonds is chosen randomly according to the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ growth probabilities ] ) and the site across it is occupied .",
    "the growth continues by re - solving the laplace equation ( [ laplace ] ) , etc . notice that the boundary conditions have changed a bit because the potential on the newly occupied site is set to zero this time",
    "this growth model manufactures fractal clusters without the need to fine tune any parameter and thus differs from ordinary critical phenomena and belongs to the class of self organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite .",
    "dbm can be grown in different geometries . by geometry",
    "we refer to the dimensionality of the lattice , to the shapes of the boundaries and to the details of the seed for growth ( usually a point or a line for two dimensional growth ) . for instance",
    ", the case is which the distant boundary is a sphere is called radial boundary conditions , and the case in which the boundary is a distant plane at the top , while the seed cluster is a parallel plane at the bottom with periodic boundary conditions on the sides , is called cylindrical boundary conditions .    there has been considerable work on simulating dla and measuring it s fractal dimension .",
    "the accepted value for the fractal dimension is @xmath7 for circular dla in two dimensions ( 2d ) and @xmath8 for infinitely wide cylindrical dla @xcite . more details and references on numerical analysis",
    "could be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a summary of values of the fractal dimension , obtained by simulations and by theoretical approaches discussed in this paper , appears in table [ results comparison ] .",
    "a novel approach to dbm , called the fixed scale transformation ( fst ) , was introduced by pietronero _",
    "et al . _ with considerable success",
    "because our work was motivated and inspired by fst , we include a short description of this approach , which is close in spirit to the real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) , but yet very different .",
    "while the rsrg transformation changes the scale , the fst transformation keeps the same scale while moving in the growth direction in real space .",
    "fst analyzes the statistics of the frozen structure , which is far behind the growing front .",
    "this region is called frozen because it has very low growth probabilities due to the screening of the laplace equation .",
    "the fst actually analyzes a cross section perpendicular to the growth direction .",
    "the most simple case studied by fst is that of the two dimensional cylindrical geometry @xcite . in 2d the sites on the cross section",
    "are gathered into pairs . a non - empty pair can have either one or two occupied sites .",
    "the probabilities for these two cases are denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , see fig . [ configurations ] .",
    "then we have : @xmath11 in fst one calculates the conditional probabilities of having one configuration follow another in the growth direction .",
    "these probabilities make up the fst matrix : @xmath12 the matrix element @xmath13 represents the conditional probability of having a configuration @xmath14 at the @xmath15 row , provided there is a configuration @xmath16 at the @xmath17 row , right below it , see fig .",
    "the fixed point of this transformation represents the asymptotic limit for the probabilities , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in this asymptotic limit , the average number of sites in each row is @xmath20 . for a self similar fractal structure ,",
    "one expects that a change of scale by a factor 2 will change the average mass of a linear cut by a factor @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the fractal dimensionality of the full 2d fractal . assuming that the above procedure represents a coarse graining of the sites into cells of width 2 , pietronero @xmath23 thus concluded that @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 to calculate the fst matrix , one must consider all possible growth processes , taking account of the boundary conditions .",
    "pietronero @xmath23 computed the probabilities using different schemes. here we follow one scheme , referred to as closed : it is periodic with a period of 2 sites , i.e. the structure is divided into columns , two sites wide , which are all identical . in order to calculate the element @xmath26 , pietronero @xmath23 set the @xmath17 row to be a @xmath10 configuration .",
    "then they considered all possible growth process which resulted in a configuration @xmath9 at the @xmath15 row , and added them up with the corresponding statistical weights .",
    "these statistical weights were determined by multiplying the probabilities for the successive growths .",
    "a similar procedure was done for the rest of the matrix elements , with the resulting fractal dimension of @xmath27 .",
    "further enhancements of fst were achieved by including empty configurations @xcite and by working with the scale invariant growth rules @xcite .",
    "fst also works well in 3d @xcite .",
    "fst is not exact , because not all possibilities are taken into account .",
    "for example , in the calculation of the element @xmath28 , pietronero _ et al .",
    "_ assume that there is a @xmath9 configuration at the _ k_th row , but they do not consider what happens below it .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that there is a @xmath10 configuration right below it , whereas in reality there might be a few consecutive @xmath9 rows . in the calculation of the element",
    "they assume that there is nothing above it , whereas in reality , at the time that a @xmath10 row is formed there may be a few @xmath9 rows above it .",
    "moreover , the evaluation of the elements is done by summing over a finite number of growth processes , whereas ideally , one should sum over infinite growth processes .",
    "it is also hard to evaluate the error in the various quantities , e.g. the fst matrix elements @xmath13 and the fractal dimension @xmath22 .      in this paper",
    "we solve the dbm in the geometry referred to by pietronero @xmath23 as `` closed '' , i.e. in a 2d column which is very tall but only two sites wide , with periodic lateral boundary conditions .",
    "each non empty level can be either a @xmath9 or a @xmath10 configuration .",
    "our solution gives the exact probabilities for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , but not through the fst approach . in spite of this , we get very similar results , which validate those of pietronero @xmath23 the differences between our results and those obtained with fst are summarized in table [ results comparison ] for the case @xmath2 .",
    "our approach is different from fst , because we use the interface rather than single rows in the frozen area .",
    "we focus our attention on the interface because it determines the solution of the laplace equation ( [ laplace ] ) .",
    "the solution to the equation is totally unaffected by what happens behind the interface , i.e. by the rest of the structure .",
    "the solution also does not depend on the history of the growth which led to the specific interface shape .",
    "we consider all the possible shapes that the interface can assume , and for each possible shape we solve the laplace equation . in the case of periodic boundary conditions with period two",
    "the characterization is simple : a single parameter characterizes all the possible shapes that the interface can have .",
    "this parameter , which we denote by @xmath16 or @xmath14 , is the height difference between the two columns , which we will call the step size. this parameter is explained in fig .",
    "in the situation where the two columns are of the same height it is obvious that the growth probabilities are equal for both sides .",
    "therefore we can assume that the growth will always be on the same side in such an event , for instance on the right side .",
    "this means that the step size can always be considered as non negative .",
    "we start by solving the laplace equation ( [ laplace ] ) ( the electrostatic problem ) for each possible interface ( sec .",
    "[ solution ] ) .",
    "first we present a general derivation in 2d with periodic lateral boundary conditions ( with a general width ) , then we solve for @xmath3 in our special geometry of width 2 ( the closed scheme ) .",
    "we do it by dividing the plane into two parts : the upper part , which is empty , and the lower part , which contains the structure .",
    "we match up the two solutions by writing down the explicit equation for the site common to both parts . from the potential we get the growth probabilities",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ growth probabilities ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ ep ] we arrange them in a matrix , which we call the evolution matrix , which functions as a temporal transfer matrix for this problem .",
    "this matrix is infinite , but the matrix elements @xmath30 decay exponentially for large @xmath16 .",
    "we then calculate the steady state which is the fixed point of the evolution matrix . in sec .",
    "[ frozen structure ] we use the evolution matrix and the steady state in order to calculate the average density of the aggregate , and therefore also the probability @xmath10 and the fractal dimension .",
    "we continue by analyzing the frozen structure below the growing interface .",
    "we observe that the frozen structure is made of a series of elements , which we call hooks , and we calculate the statistics of their appearance . by doing so",
    ", we fully characterize the structure .",
    "we carry out the same procedure for a few different values of @xmath1 in the more general dbm model .",
    "we summarize in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "before solving the laplace equation for our special geometry we present a derivation which applies to general systems with periodic boundary conditions in 2d .",
    "we look at a rectangle , @xmath31 sites high and @xmath32 sites wide , with lateral periodicity .",
    "the laplace equation is satisfied by every site in this rectangle .",
    "this is the situation in those parts in space which are unoccupied by the aggregate .",
    "first , we find a set of basis functions which span the linear space of solutions .",
    "these basis functions obey the discrete laplace equation and have lateral periodicity , but do not obey the boundary conditions on the upper and lower boundaries .",
    "we formulate the latter boundary conditions and find the solution which obeys them by finding the right constants for the linear combination of the basis functions . in this process",
    "the boundary green function will emerge .",
    "the discrete laplace equation in 2d is : @xmath33 inserting an exponential solution , @xmath34 eq .",
    "( [ discrete_rearranged ] ) yields the dispersion relation @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "this reduces to the linear dispersion relation for the continuous laplace equation : @xmath37 , in the limit where the lattice constant is much smaller than the potential wave length : @xmath38 .",
    "the relations for the discrete and continuous cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ dispersion_fig ] .",
    "the discrete case introduces an upper cutoff on the absolute value of @xmath39 , @xmath40 the maximum corresponds to the shortest possible wavelength , i.e. 2 sites . for a period @xmath32",
    ", the periodic boundary conditions require that @xmath41 , hence @xmath42 with @xmath43 . for each @xmath44",
    "we have two possible @xmath39 s : @xmath45 with @xmath43 .",
    "the case @xmath46 is special , because there is apparently only one solution with @xmath47 , namely @xmath48 the second solution is obtained by considering the limit @xmath49 the rest of the @xmath50 basis solutions are @xmath51 and @xmath52      the boundary conditions at the top row are that the gradient ( difference ) is uniform and equal to 1 in some arbitrary units : @xmath53 this condition corresponds to a uniform flux of incoming particles @xcite . at the bottom",
    "the potential is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an arbitrary function .",
    "we define @xmath56 @xmath57 also solves the discrete laplace equation , but it obeys different boundary conditions . at the top it has zero gradient , and at the bottom it is the same as @xmath58 .",
    "a set of @xmath32 linearly independent functions that obey the boundary conditions at the top and the discrete laplace equation are , @xmath59 we now take the limit @xmath60 , and observe that @xmath61 ( pietronero @xmath23 used @xmath62 in their calculations in ref .",
    "we have thus discarded @xmath32 of our basis solutions , which we denoted by @xmath63 .",
    "the remaining @xmath32 basis functions obey an orthogonality condition at the bottom boundary : @xmath64 the solution will be a linear combination of these basis solutions : @xmath65 where @xmath66 are @xmath32 complex scalars .",
    "the orthogonality condition ( [ orthonormality ] ) implies that @xmath67 and therefore @xmath68 where we introduce the boundary green function : @xmath69 being a linear combination of basis functions , @xmath70 also obeys the discrete laplace equation .",
    "when @xmath71 the function has zero gradient , and at the bottom boundary it obeys @xmath72 the fact that the specified boundary conditions are real and symmetric with respect to @xmath73 also means that @xmath70 is real and symmetric , i.e. @xmath74 the growth probabilities will be determined by the potential values near the interface , so only the rows @xmath75 and @xmath76 will be of importance to us . in this formulation , the row @xmath75 is known , so we are really only interested in the row @xmath76 , which will be determined by @xmath77 .",
    "we therefore denote @xmath78 before proceeding we note that @xmath79 the final expression for the solution in a cylinder of width @xmath32 is @xmath80      we now turn to solve for @xmath3 in our geometry ( fig .",

    "we note again that all of the structure below the interface has no effect on the solution for @xmath3 , and hence does not change the growth probabilities . as mentioned earlier , the interface has the shape of a step whose height is variable .",
    "the conditions for the derivation of sec .",
    "[ general_derivation ] are not fulfilled now because the set of sites which obey the discrete laplace equation do not form a rectangle .",
    "we therefore solve the problem by dissecting the plane into two parts ; the upper part with @xmath81 , which is empty , and the lower part with @xmath82 , which contains the aggregate .",
    "first , we solve the laplace equation ( [ discrete_rearranged ] ) for the upper and the lower parts separately , expressing them in terms of the potential at the connecting site , @xmath83 , which is denoted by @xmath84 .",
    "then we write the explicit laplace equation for the site @xmath85 to patch the two parts together .",
    "the upper part @xmath81 is rectangular with lateral periodicity with @xmath86 and with gradient one for @xmath71 , so we apply the general derivation of sec .",

    "( [ estimate dimension ] ) . in order",
    "to use this equation we have to perform a calculation of the probabilities @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which is straight forward : @xmath215 one can compare this exact value with the value obtained using the fst approach : @xmath216 @xcite . plugging our value for @xmath10 into eq .",
    "( [ estimate dimension ] ) gives the fractal dimension : @xmath217 it is possible to bound the error in the @xmath200th order numerical evaluation of the fractal dimension : @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is some other constant .",
    "this means that one can obtain any desired accuracy by using higher order evaluations .",
    "this result can be compared with pietronero s : @xmath27 @xcite for the closed scheme .",
    "we can make a more exact comparison with fst by extending fst to include @xmath220 growth processes , instead of @xmath221 , and by using a high ceiling @xmath222 , instead of @xmath62 , as used by pietronero @xmath23 in this case the values @xmath223 and @xmath224 are obtained .",
    "one can also compare our results to simulation results for the 2d cylindrical dla , which is @xmath225 @xcite , and to the 2d circular dla , which is @xmath226 @xcite .",
    "these results are summarized in table [ results comparison ] .",
    "the steady state @xmath149 provides complete statistical information about the interface , but it does not describe directly the properties of the structure behind the interface , which is frozen .",
    "the key to the analysis is to understand that the structure is actually a series of hooks of different heights , piled one on top of the other .",
    "a hook starts above a @xmath10 configuration and ends at the next @xmath10 configuration ( including ) .",
    "[ hooks ] demonstrates a few such hooks .",
    "a full description of the structure is provided by the set of probabilities of having a hook of height @xmath16 , which we denote by @xmath227 .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath228 s is straightforward using the steady state @xmath149 and the evolution matrix @xmath0 .",
    "we have to look at growth processes which create @xmath10 configurations ( these are always side growths , which occur inside the fjord ) : @xmath229 where @xmath230 is the normalization factor because it is the average probability for a growth to occur inside the fjord .",
    "one can obtain an asymptotic approximation of @xmath227 for @xmath231 by using the asymptotic approximation of @xmath172 and using a series expansion of @xmath232 in terms of @xmath233 . by doing",
    "so one can carry out the sum in ( [ q(i ) ] ) and find out that @xmath234 with @xmath235 for @xmath236 the above expression should be multiplied by @xmath237 , because only growths at the bottom of the fjord contribute to @xmath238 .",
    "the eight first probabilities are presented in table [ q(j ) ] with an accuracy of @xmath189 .",
    "they were evaluated using the sum ( [ q(i ) ] ) with very precise values of @xmath172 , obtained by a high order truncation .",
    "these predictions were verified using a dla computer simulation . in this simulation",
    "we laid 40000 hooks . each time a hook of height @xmath14 was formed a counter @xmath239 was raised by one . table [ q(j ) ] summarizes the normalized results : the fluctuations are expected to be of the order of @xmath240 . in this respect the measurement is in excellent agreement with the theory .",
    "the @xmath241 s give complete information about the frozen structure , so we can also derive the fractal dimension @xmath22 and @xmath10 in terms of the @xmath241 s : @xmath242 equation ( [ c_2 ] ) sums over the probabilities to have a row with 2 occupied sites at the end of hooks of height @xmath14 ( there is just one such row in a hook , the height of which is @xmath14 ) .",
    "the result in eq .",
    "( [ c_2 ] ) is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ c_2= ] ) , hence the estimation of the fractal dimension @xmath22 gives the same result as in eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) .    now that we have the @xmath241 s we can also compute the exact conditional probabilities for having one configuration follow another in the growth direction , i.e. the fst matrix elements @xmath13 .",
    "the conditional probability for having a @xmath10 configuration above another @xmath10 configuration is just the probability for having a hook of height one .",
    "thus , @xmath243 .",
    "the conditional probability for having a @xmath10 configuration above a @xmath9 configuration , @xmath244 , can be expressed as : @xmath245 these can be compared with @xmath246 and @xmath247 obtained by pietronero s direct evaluation in the closed scheme ( computed by summing up to two growths ) @xcite",
    ".    why does fst work so well ?",
    "there are a few differences between our calculations and the ones performed in refs .",
    "@xcite using fst .",
    "first , fst uses a ceiling with @xmath62 , instead of @xmath248 as is done here , but this seems to have a small effect on the growth probabilities ( less than @xmath249 for @xmath2 ) . in any case one can try to implement fst also with @xmath248 and thus remedy this small effect .",
    "second , the fact that a relatively small number of growth processes is considered does not change the fst matrix considerably .",
    "this effect could also be fixed by taking into account a larger number of growth processes .",
    "third , in computing , for example , the conditional probabilities of having a @xmath10 ( or @xmath9 ) row above a given @xmath10 row , the fact that a few @xmath9 rows may exist above the basis @xmath10 row at the time of it s formation is not taken into account .",
    "this problem is inherent within fst and can not be fixed in it s framework .",
    "however , this effect is found to be small because the probability for having two @xmath9 rows or more above a @xmath10 row at the time of it s formation is very small ( about @xmath250 ) .",
    "moreover , the probability of having @xmath14 @xmath9 rows above a @xmath10 row at the time of it s formation decays exponentially as a function of @xmath14 , with the small factor @xmath251 . repeating the fst computation for the case of a high ceiling @xmath248 , as in our own scheme , and accounting for as many as 30 growth processes , changes @xmath22 by @xmath252 .",
    "this difference in @xmath22 is smaller by an order of magnitude from the differences in the fst matrix elements themselves , which reflect the robustness of the fst approximation .",
    "niemeyer , pietronero and wiesmann introduced the dbm with the parameter @xmath1 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ growth probabilities ] ) , also referred to as the @xmath1 model @xcite . for @xmath253 , all possible growths have identical probabilities , yielding a special version of the eden model , which does not allow growth inside closed loops .",
    "this produces compact structures , i.e. the fractal and euclidean dimensions are equal : @xmath254 ( in our model @xmath255 is determined by the average density and thus is less than @xmath221 because of the closed loops ) . for @xmath256",
    "we get the dla model , which has @xmath257 , and for @xmath258 we get a deterministic model , in which the strongest electric field always wins , and therefore produces straight lines with @xmath259 .",
    "we see that as @xmath1 increases from zero to infinity , the fractal dimension @xmath22 decreases from 2 to 1 continuously and monotonically .",
    "we can get exact results for any value of @xmath1 in the same way that we got the exact results for @xmath2 .",
    "the only difference is in the values of the evolution matrix elements @xmath30 , which are now evaluated using eqs .",
    "( [ etae_(i , j ) ] , [ s_j ] ) . the steady state",
    "is then computed by solving eqs . ( [ p = ep ] ) and ( [ sump_j=1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath209 , @xmath260 , @xmath10 and @xmath22 are evaluated using eqs .",
    "( [ pup ] , [ rho ] , [ c_2= ] and [ estimate dimension ] ) , and the hook height distribution @xmath241 is found using eq .",
    "( [ q(i ) ] ) .",
    "the solution is shown in table [ eta tab ] .",
    "note that the solution for @xmath261 is shown with only 3 significant digits .",
    "this is because the higher the value of @xmath1 , the slower is the convergence of @xmath172 and @xmath241 .",
    "we used in this case a truncation scheme with @xmath204 , and achieved an accuracy of @xmath203 for @xmath22 .",
    "we presented a complete theoretical solution of the dla problem in a plane with periodic boundary conditions , with a period of 2 .",
    "first we identified the possible shapes of the growing interface , as steps of varying heights .",
    "then we solved the laplace equation with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the potential defined the growth probabilities , which we inserted into the evolution matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath30 was the conditional probability to go from a step of size @xmath14 to a step of size @xmath16 in the next time step , by the appropriate growth process .",
    "next we presented the state of the interface using an infinite vector , which we denoted by @xmath162 . in this notation the dynamics of the system was simply described by a transfer matrix , see eq .",
    "( [ transfer matrix ] ) .",
    "this allowed us to look for the steady state , which we also denoted by @xmath149 .",
    "we argued that this state was attractive so that starting from any initial condition of the system we would reach the steady state in an exponential way .",
    "the steady state and the growth probabilities enabled us to calculate the average probability for upward growths , which was inversely proportional to the average density .",
    "we calculated the probability for having a filled row , @xmath10 and the complementary probability for having a half filled row , @xmath9 , and used these to obtain the fractal dimension , @xmath262 .",
    "our next step was to analyze the geometry of the frozen structure .",
    "we identified it as being composed of hooks of different heights , which were laid one on top of the other .",
    "the frozen structure was fully characterized by the probabilities @xmath241 of having a hook of height @xmath14 .",
    "this concluded the solution of the problem .",
    "we also repeated the same procedure for different values of @xmath1 , in the more general dbm model .",
    "the solution we presented is analytical and exact , in the sense that any desired numerical accuracy can be achieved .",
    "the steady state vector was presented as a sum of exponentially decaying contributions .",
    "it was thus possible to bound the maximal error , with an expression that decays exponentially with the order of approximation . a similar",
    "bound applied for the computed fractal dimension .",
    "our results are very close to those obtained by the closed scheme fst .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with dla simulations , which we performed in the specified geometry ( 2 sites periodic boundary conditions ) . the same approach can be utilized for more complex geometries .",
    "although it might be difficult to obtain exact results , our method should yield a systematic scheme of approximations .",
