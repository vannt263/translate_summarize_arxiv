    "a permutation group @xmath4 is called _ @xmath0-transitive _ if it is transitive on ordered @xmath0-tuples of distinct elements and _ highly - transitive _ if it is @xmath0-transitive for every @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath6 is given as an automorphism group , it can often be verified that the given action is highly transitive .",
    "this is the case for any subgroup of @xmath7 which contains all finitely supported permutations , where @xmath8 is any infinite set .",
    "other examples include groups such as @xmath9 and many of its subgroups .",
    "but for most groups the question : `` what is the maximal @xmath0 for which the group admits a faithfull , @xmath0-transitive action '' ? is wide open .",
    "it was shown by mcdonough @xcite that any non - abelian free group admits a highly transitive action .",
    "another proof which is more useful from our point of view was later given by dixon in @xcite , using a baire category type argument .    in this paper , we prove that a _ surface group _ ( the fundamental group of a closed , orientable surface without boundry of genus greater than @xmath10 ) admits a faithfull , highly - transitive action of countably infinite degree .",
    "before we continue , we introduce some notation .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the full symmetric group of a countable set which we identify with the integer numbers .",
    "the action of @xmath12 on @xmath13 is always from the right and the image of an element @xmath14 under @xmath15 is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath17 then @xmath18 $ ] will denote the set of all integers between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we define a group topology on @xmath21 where a basis is given by the sets of the form @xmath22)=\\left\\{\\psi\\in{s_{\\infty}}\\ \\left|\\ \\psi\\big|_{[n ] } =   { \\varphi}\\big|_{[n]}\\right . \\right\\},\\",
    "( { \\varphi}\\in{s_{\\infty}},n\\in{{\\mathbb{n}}}).\\ ] ] it is easy to see that if @xmath23 and @xmath24 is any finite set then @xmath25 is open in this topology .",
    "notice that this topology is the restriction to @xmath21 of the topology of pointwise convergence on the space of all functions @xmath26 and a straightforward proof shows that @xmath21 is a topological group which is completely metrizable .",
    "the problem of finding highly - transitive subgroups of @xmath21 can now be approached via the following proposition , derived directly from the definition of the topology on @xmath21 .",
    "[ ht = dense ] let @xmath27 .",

    "[ main ] let @xmath28 be the fundamental group of an orientable surface of genus @xmath29 .",
    "then there exists a dense subgroup of @xmath21 which is isomorphic to @xmath30 .",
    "the methods used in this work to obtain dense embeddings of surface groups into @xmath21 are analogous to those used in @xcite and @xcite to show that if a locally compact group contains a dense , free subgroup of every finite rank @xmath2 then it contains a dense surface group of every genus @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath21 is _ not _ locally - compact but as we shall see , by prooving that @xmath21 has a dense free subgroup of every finite rank @xmath2 with the additional property that certain elements of that free group generate a non - discrete cyclic group we can apply the same methods in our setting .",
    "as a first step to proving theorem [ main ] we prove the following .    [ free - dense ] let @xmath32 , let @xmath33 be reduced words and assume that there exists @xmath34 such that every @xmath35 is not a conjugate of a power of @xmath36 . then",

    "we prove the theorem using baire s category theorem .",
    "let @xmath8 be a topological space .",
    "a subset of @xmath8 which is a countable intersection of dense , open sets is called _ residual _ or _",
    "generic_.    baire s theorem states that in a non - trivial , complete metric space , a residual set is dense .",
    "since they are dense and closed under countable intersections , residual sets in a complete metric space can be thought of as being `` large '' .",
    "dixon showed in @xcite that if we denote @xmath42 then the set of elements in @xmath43 that freely generate a free group is residual in @xmath44 .",
    "we use a somewhat different setting than dixon in order to prove the existence of the desired dense free subgroups .",
    "fix @xmath45 to be the _ shift _ permutation ,",
    "i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "we show that for every @xmath47 , the set of elements @xmath48 such that @xmath49 has the properties stated in theorem [ free - dense ] is residual is @xmath50 .",
