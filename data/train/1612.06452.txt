    "the existence of two or more pairs of synchrotron emitting radio lobes driven by the same central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is extremely important for understanding the evolution of agns , as it provides vital evidence for multiple episodes of nuclear activity .",
    "such sources are often termed double - double radio galaxies ( ddrgs ) @xcite .",
    "these ddrgs exhibit a wide range of linear sizes , from less than few hundreds of kpc up to more than a mpc @xcite .",
    "for these episodic sources the new jets usually follow the same direction as the previous jets .",
    "there are a few examples of `` misaligned ddrgs '' which have different orientation of axes for the two epochs .",
    "@xcite show that the misalignment angle is within @xmath020@xmath1 for a sample of 12 ddrgs .",
    "however , the steep - spectrum core - dominated radio galaxy 3c293 provides excellent observational evidence of restarted jet activity along with a @xmath035@xmath1 jet rotation @xcite .",
    "the estimated time - scale of episodic activity in 3c293 is @xmath010@xmath5  yr , which is significantly smaller than most other known ddrgs @xcite . in accordance with this",
    ", found that the outer lobes are @xmath060 myr old and that the jet activity related to the formation of the outer lobes ceased within the last myr .",
    "meanwhile , the misaligned inner lobes are only about @xmath00.3 myr old .",
    "the derived jet time - scales provide strong support for the lense - thirring precession model @xcite , in which the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) spin , and therefore the jet axis , flips rapidly .",
    "recently , @xcite identified another ddrg , b0707 - 359 , with a misalignment angle of about @xmath030@xmath1 between the two epochs of activity .",
    "the reorientation of the jet axis in these misaligned ddrgs may be caused by an axis precession or axis flip of the agn .",
    "influence of a nearby galaxy or the coalescence of massive black holes may trigger a new jet with sufficient axis rotation to explain the observations @xcite .",
    "historically , radio galaxies with a rapid change of jet direction , in particular `` x - shaped '' galaxies , have been proposed as candidates for binary black holes ( see e.g. ) .",
    "these sources are also promising contributers to the gravitational wave background @xcite .",
    "recently , double - peaked emission lines in agn have been suggested as an indicator for binary black holes .",
    "such lines are a possible signature of a bound pair of smbhs , moving with their own characteristic velocities @xcite . however , apart from binary black holes , there are other scenarios that may explain double - peaked emission lines , including jet - cloud interactions or rotating gaseous disks @xcite . of these different possibilities ,",
    "the scenario of binary black holes is more likely in the case of merger remnants or elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "a misaligned ddrg hosted by a giant elliptical with double - peaked emission lines is therefore of great interest as a potential candidate for harbouring a binary black hole .",
    "such systems may provide direct observational evidence for galaxy mergers as triggers of multiple epochs of jet activity @xcite .    from our previous study @xcite",
    "we have identified one such source , j1328@xmath42752 .",
    "this system shows not only restarted jet activity with an axis reorientation , but also double - peaked emissions lines from the central agn at a redshift 0.0911 .",
    "@xcite included the host galaxy of j1328@xmath42752 in a list of 3030 galaxies that show double - peaked narrow emission - lines in their ` sloan digital sky survey ' ( sdss ) spectra .",
    "the linear sizes of the inner and outer doubles of this source are 96 and 413 kpc , respectively . in this paper",
    "we present new low - frequency radio observations of j1328@xmath42752 along with a study of the optical spectrum .",
    "we assume a universe with h@xmath6=71 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath7=0.27 and @xmath8=0.73 .",
    "both radio and optical data have been used to analyse the characteristics of j1328@xmath42752 .    * radio data : * the radio observations were performed with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) under proposal codes 23@xmath9056 and 28@xmath9044 . the target was observed on 2013 - 03 - 24 for 3.6 hr at 607 mhz and on 2015 - 06 - 27 for 4.7 hr at 325 mhz .",
    "we observed the flux density calibrator , 3c286 , at the beginning and end of each observing run and also used it as a bandpass calibrator based on the scale of .",
    "the phase calibrator , j1330 + 251 , was observed for @xmath05 min after each of several @xmath020  min exposures of j1328@xmath42752 .",
    "we used the aips software package for data reduction . to obtain the best possible images ,",
    "several rounds of self - calibration were performed .    for this study",
    "we also used images at 1400 mhz obtained from first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters ; @xcite ) and nvss ( nrao vla sky survey ; @xcite ) . since about 40% of the flux density ( and structure ) is lost in the high - resolution first map , the first and nvss images were combined to image the range of structure shown in fig .",
    "[ j1328_fig1 ] .",
    "the final merged map was checked for flux density consistency by comparing the flux - density of point sources in the first and merged maps .",
    "this difference did not exceed 1% .",
    "the integrated flux densities at different frequencies are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "additionally , we used the nvss q and u stokes maps and the aips task comb to create images of the linearly polarized intensity and fractional polarization .",
    "* optical data : * the optical spectrum of j1328@xmath42752 was obtained from data release dr12 of the sdss .",
    "the observed spectrum is contaminated by the stellar absorption features of the host galaxy and also affected by the foreground extinction and recession velocity of the system . before analyzing the narrow emission lines , we have therefore removed all other features using the penalized pixel - fitting tool ( @xmath10 , @xcite ) .",
    "the full - resolution maps at 325 , 607 and 1400 mhz are shown in fig .",

    "weak emission from the core is detected at 607 mhz , while the 325 mhz map does not show any clear core emission .",
    "the flux density values ( see table [ table2 ] ) of the central component indicate that this is a flat - spectrum radio core .",
    "the outer lobes are asymmetric in morphology .",
    "a bright hotspot in the southern outer lobe is visible at all three frequencies , while there is no evidence of a hotspot in the northern outer lobe . in the gmrt images we note a sharp bend of the northern outer lobe towards the north - east and an enhancement of flux density at the position where the lobe starts to bend .",
    "the combined 1400 mhz image also shows an enhancement of flux density at the same position .",
    "the asymmetric inner double is completely embedded in the older diffuse emission .",
    "the northern inner component is dominated by a bright hotspot , while the southern inner component has an elongated structure with a bright hotspot at the end . the integrated flux densities and those of the components",
    "are presented in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] respectively and plotted in fig .",

    "the typical stellar velocity dispersion of the host determined using ppxf is 193.1@xmath213.6 kms@xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with the result from the sdss dr12 survey ( velocity dispersion 176.8@xmath29.7 kms@xmath3 ) .",

    "we find that the two components are separated by a velocity of 235 @xmath2 10.5 kms@xmath3 .",
    "such a velocity separation between the blue and red components is consistent with a scenario of two cores in merging galaxies @xcite .",
    "for every line , the intensities of the two narrow - line components are different . to understand the classes of the two merging components , we use the bpt diagnostic diagram @xcite shown in fig .",

    "these data , together with the 1400 mhz image , reveal that the source has four distinct components in addition to a flat - spectrum core .",
    "the spectral indices of the outer double is steeper than the inner one , which indicate two epochs of jet activity ( e.g. ) although the difference here is small due to an active hot - spot in the southern outer lobe and possible re - acceleration in the sharp bend in the northern outer lobe . from the radio morphology and spectral index analysis we confirm this source as a ddrg with an axis rotation .",
    "the percentage of polarized emission is similar to that observed for x - shaped radio galaxies which show jet reorientation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "here we speculate that the different strengths of the two components of the optical emission lines is an indication that the system is associated with two distinct narrow line regions ( nlrs ) orbiting around each of two separate nuclei , plausibly constituted by a merging massive black hole binary .",
