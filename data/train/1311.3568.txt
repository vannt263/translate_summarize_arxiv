    "study of electromagnetic emission from a supernova sn across various wavelengths provides us with important clues about the nature of the explosion as well as the progenitor star .",
    "early time optical emission from a sn is used to derive many important parameters of the explosion ( e.g. total explosion energy , nickel mass etc . ) whereas late time optical emission is a probe of the inner layers of ejecta . though",
    "not all sne are detectable at radio wavelengths at a very young age , a small fraction of them have detectable radio emission even at a very young age . according to current understanding , this radio emission is non - thermal in origin @xcite .",
    "the fast moving sn ejecta drives a strong shock into the circumstellar medium ( _ forward shock _ ) .",
    "electrons are accelerated to relativistic energies at this shock .",
    "these electrons gyrate around the post - shock magnetic field and radiate via synchrotron emission .",
    "this radiation is an important probe of the pre - explosion evolution of massive stars .    during their evolution ,",
    "massive stars lose mass ( by either continuous stellar winds or periods of rapid / episodic mass loss @xcite ) which forms the circumstellar medium in which the sn shock evolves . the velocity of stellar winds is small ( for wolf - rayet stars it can be @xmath10% of the ejecta velocity ) compared to that of the sn ejecta , and therefore in a short time the fast moving ejecta probes a long period of mass loss .",
    "observationally determined mass loss rates can be used to constrain stellar evolution models .",
    "young radio bright sn also offer an opportunity to study particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification at these shocks .",
    "type ii - p sn are a class of core - collapse sn displaying an intermediate plateau phase in their bolometric light curve which extends from @xmath11 .",
    "they show a wide range of magnitude in plateau phase and expansion velocity @xcite .",
    "their progenitor stars have an extended hydrogen envelope prior to collapse .",
    "therefore they are at the extremity of a range of stars retaining different hydrogen envelope masses at the time of explosion . as a result of the sn explosion the hydrogen envelope is ejected at high velocity .",
    "the plateau phase is powered by a hydrogen recombination wave traveling inwards as this ejecta cools due to expansion and radiation losses .",
    "the photosphere demarcates this expanding hydrogen envelope into an inner region of high opacity and an outer region of low opacity .",
    "the plateau phase has been modeled numerically , semi - analytically @xcite and analytically @xcite .",
    "the extended duration of plateau phase makes these sn more easily detectable even in low cadence surveys .",
    "the long duration of the plateau phase may have consequences for the non - thermal radiation processes .",
    "the high radiation density of optical ( ubvri ) photons during the plateau phase may cause effective cooling of relativistic electron population at the forward shock @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission from a young type ii - p sn can be thermal or non - thermal in origin @xcite .",
    "the thermal component can originate as a result of free - free emission in the post - shock region or at the _ reverse shock _ ( a shock which is driven in to the expanding sn ejecta ) , whereas the non - thermal emission can be due to inverse compton scattering of low energy photons by relativistic electrons at the forward shock .",
    "therefore in case a sn is bright and detectable in x - rays at early times , much more information is available for understanding the dynamics of the forward shock , the reverse shock , the density profile of the ejecta and the circumstellar medium . in case of sn 2004dj ,",
    "@xcite have estimated various important parameters relevant to blast wave dynamics and particle acceleration using @xmath12 epochs of _ chandra _ observations . in the case of sn 2011ja",
    ", @xcite have reported that the x - ray flux from this sn on second observation epoch was higher compared to the x - ray flux on first epoch by a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "they have argued that it can be explained by an enhancement in the density of the circumstellar medium probed by the shock at later time and have suggested that a fraction of type ii - p explosions may take place inside bubbles blown by hot winds or variable circumstellar medium created by non - steady winds . therefore following",
    "the temporal evolution of young type ii - p explosion in radio and x - rays band will provide us with crucial information about the explosion and their surrounding medium created during the late evolution of their progenitor stars .",
    "sn 2012aw is a bright type ii - p sn which exploded in the galaxy m95 ( d @xmath14 ) .",

    "the progenitor seems to be a faint red super - giant and is the most massive type ii - p progenitor discovered till date .",
    "both works noted that the star had a significantly higher extinction prior to its explosion as a sn and interpret it as a signature of dust destruction by explosion .",
    "@xcite note that the progenitor s luminosity is not very well constrained because of uncertainty in the extinction which will further affect the estimates on progenitor s mass .",
    "@xcite claim evidence for dust - destruction by explosion as the current extinction to the sn is very low .",
    "this may have interesting consequences for the progenitors of type ii - p sn .",
    "sn 2012aw has been extensively studied through optical and uv photometry . @xcite",

    "sn 2012aw was first detected in radio jvla-@xmath3 band ( @xmath31 ) at @xmath32 days by @xcite & @xcite .",
    "we conducted the follow up radio observations of 2012aw at various epochs extending up to @xmath33 days after the explosion using _",

    "the source fluxes were extracted by fitting gaussian using task _ jmfit _ assuming point sources .",
    "the errors reported on the flux are obtained by using the image statistics from the region surrounding the source .",
    "in the case of sn 2012aw explosion date is strongly constrained to within @xmath34 based on a non - detection ( limiting magnitude of @xmath35 ) on @xmath36 reported by @xcite and the first detection on @xmath37 reported by @xcite .",
    "we have used the explosion date as @xmath38 in this work .",
    "we have explored the effect of varying the explosion date within the @xmath39 time range .",
    "the radio observations are presented in table [ table-1 : radio obs ] .",
    "the interaction of fast moving ejecta with the circumstellar medium drives a strong shock which moves ahead of the ejecta into the circumstellar medium and is called the ` forward shock ' .",
    "electrons are accelerated to relativistic energies at this shock via fermi first order process .",
    "these electrons radiate via synchrotron mechanism in the post - shock magnetic field .",
    "the electron spectrum is described as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the normalization constant and @xmath42 is electron index .",
    "the radio emission from young sne is generally modeled as synchrotron emission by this electron population affected by a variety of absorption processes .",
    "the absorption can be modeled as a combination of synchrotron self absorption ( ssa , the electrons which are responsible for synchrotron emission also absorb the synchrotron photons ) & free - free absorption ( ffa , the thermal electrons in the post - shock medium absorb the synchrotron photons ) .",
    "we use chevalier model - i ( table 1 .",
    "@xcite ) to study this emission . in this model",
    "the radius of the forward shock increases as , @xmath43 and energy densities in relativistic electrons and magnetic field are proportional to the thermal energy density which leads to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the energy density in the relativistic electrons and and @xmath46 is the energy density in the post - shock magnetic field respectively .",
    "another important assumption inherent to the model is that the electron index @xmath42 remains constant during the evolution .",
    "electron index can be obtained by fitting a power law to the optically thin component .",
    "the equation for the radio flux evolution in such a case is given in @xcite for the case of a sn blast wave expanding into a circumstellar medium set up by a uniform wind ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "if we try to model the radio emission from sn 2012aw by a simple _ ssa+ffa _ model , the best fit gives @xmath48 , but results in a value of @xmath49 greater than @xmath50 ( _ ssa _ model : @xmath51 ; _ ssa+ffa _ model : @xmath52 ) , implying an accelerated blast wave , which is unlikely as the blast wave decelerates due to its interaction with the circumstellar matter . the difference between model and data at early time is relatively large compared to that at late times .    in order to explore it",
    "further we make a study of spectral index evolution using our radio data as shown in figure [ fig : spectral_index ] . in case of a source that can be described by a simple _ ssa+ffa _ model without cooling the radio",
    "spectral index approaches the value , @xmath53 , as the source enters the optically thin regime .",
    "the spectral index curves labeled as ` @xmath54 ' and ` @xmath55 ' have values lower than @xmath56 for an extended period of time during which the supernova has a plateau in its optical bolometric light curve , whereas ` @xmath57 ' spectral index values slowly approach the optically thin regime value .",
    "this is because due to electron cooling the flux in higher frequency bands is diminished more in comparison to lower frequency bands and this leads to a dip in the spectral index .",
    "the simplistic model proposed here may not fully account for the dip in the spectral index curves , -indicating that one may need to go beyond simple model described here to accommodate early time high frequency observations .",
    "a more realistic model will include the effect of variation in electron index and mass loss in to consideration as has been done in the case of sn 1993j by @xcite .",
    "electron cooling can be due to coulomb , synchrotron or inverse compton mechanisms or adiabatic expansion .",
    "cooling has been discussed in the case of type ii - p sne by @xcite and @xcite have discussed its importance in case of sn 2002ap , a type ic event . to determine the dominant cooling mechanism , we need to compare the cooling timescales for various mechanisms .",
    "the rate at which an electron of energy @xmath58 loses energy by adiabatic expansion , inverse compton scattering and synchrotron emission is @xmath59 respectively , where @xmath60 is energy density of the radiation field and @xmath61 is the magnetic field .",
    "the characteristic energy loss timescale @xmath62 can be written as @xmath63 . the adiabatic cooling timescale @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the cooling timescales for inverse compton and synchrotron therefore can be written using formulas for energy loss from @xcite as @xmath65 where @xmath60 in our case is energy density of photons at supernova radiosphere and @xmath46 is energy density of the post - shock magnetic field . in the following subsections",
    "we will compare the cooling timescale for inverse compton and synchrotron loses and determine the dominant cooling mechanism . in order to compare the cooling timescales we first need to estimate the post - shock magnetic field and the radiation density at forward shock .      to get the synchrotron cooling timescale we need an estimate of magnetic field . in the csm interaction models for radio supernova , the post - shock magnetic field",
    "is assumed to scale with time according to a power law . in chevalier model",
    "- i the magnetic field evolves as @xmath66 .",
    "this is because magnetic energy density is proportional to thermal energy density , which for a constant parameter wind medium goes as @xmath67 , therefore @xmath68 .",
    "if we know the magnetic field at epoch @xmath69 it can simply be scaled to get the field at any other epoch using @xmath70 we use the value @xmath71 in our calculations in accordance with chevalier model - i . to get an estimate of magnetic field",
    "we can either use a late time radio spectrum or a low frequency radio lightcurve which are relatively free from the electron cooling effects .",
    "we consider the @xmath72 lightcurve for this part of calculation . in order to have minimum free parameters we need to check whether ffa is important to model the @xmath73 radio data available to us ( @xmath74 ) .    to get an estimate of the ffa we use @xmath75 determined from epoch of x - ray detection ( time",
    "at which the optical depth to x - rays becomes unity ) where @xmath76 is mass loss rate in units of @xmath77 , @xmath78 is wind velocity in units of @xmath79 .",
    "this object was first detected in x - ray ( @xmath80 band ) by @xcite approximately @xmath81 after the explosion .",

    "the seemingly slow objects between @xmath123 and @xmath122 lines are dominated by ffa at early times or are affected by cooling at early times .      to get the compton cooling timescale we need the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we construct a bolometric lightcurve using published photometric ( ubvri ) data from @xcite ( _ swift photometry _ ) & @xcite .",
    "we take the available photometric data and fill in the gaps using linear interpolation . note",
    "that we have not included the infrared photometry which is not available at these epochs , and due to this the bolometric luminosity may be a higher by at most @xmath124 at the plateau phase .",

    "the ratio of synchrotron and compton cooling timescales is independent of electron energy @xmath130    it is evident from figure [ fig : cooling - ts2 ] that compton cooling dominates over the synchrotron cooling mechanism .",
    "therefore in order to model the radio spectrum at early epochs and at high frequency we need to consider the effect of inverse compton cooling mechanism on emission .",
    "this can be done by modeling the kinetic equation for electrons with the relevant energy loss terms included .      assuming that an electron emits synchrotron radiation at its characteristic frequency @xmath131",

    "it shows that at very early times most of the _ jvla _ radio bands are affected , but as the sn bolometric flux decreases @xmath139 goes to larger and larger values as can be seen from equation [ eqn : c - cool - freq ] .",
    "it shows that electron cooling needs to be considered for a self - consistent modeling of early times high frequency radio emission .",
