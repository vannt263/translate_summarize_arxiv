    "at temperatures where liquids have a diffusion constant similar to that of ambient temperature water , the translational and rotational diffusion , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , are well described by the stokes - einstein ( se ) relation  @xcite [ eq : se ] d_t= and stokes - einstein - debye ( sed ) relation  @xcite [ eq : sed ] d_r= , where @xmath4 is the temperature , @xmath5 the viscosity , @xmath6 the boltzmann constant and @xmath7 is the `` molecular '' radius .",
    "these equations are derived by a combination of classical hydrodynamics ( stokes law ) and simple kinetic theory ( e.g , the einstein relation )  @xcite .",
    "recently the limits of the se and sed relations have been an active field of experimental  @xcite , theoretical  @xcite and computational  @xcite research .",
    "the general consensus is that the se and sed relations hold for low - molecular - weight liquids for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the glass transition temperature . for @xmath15 ,",
    "deviations from either one or both of the se and sed relations are observed .",
    "experimentally it is found that the se relation holds for many liquids in their stable and weakly supercooled regimes , but when the liquid is deeply supercooled it overestimates @xmath2 relative to @xmath5 by as much as two or three orders of magnitude , a phenomenon usually referred to as the `` breakdown '' of the se relation .",
    "the situation for the sed relation is more complex .",
    "some experimental studies found agreement with the predicted values of the sed relation even for deeply supercooled liquids  @xcite , while others claim also a breakdown of the sed relation to the same extent as for the se relation  @xcite .",
    "the failure of these relations provides a clear indication of a fundamental change in the dynamics and relaxation of the system .",
    "indeed , the changing dynamics of the liquid as it approaches the glass transition is well documented , but not yet fully understood  @xcite .",
    "there is a large body of evidence  @xcite that , upon cooling , the liquid does not become a glass in a spatially homogeneous fashion  @xcite .",
    "instead the system is characterized by the appearance of regions in which the structural relaxation time can differ by orders of magnitude from the average over the entire system  @xcite .",
    "the liquid is characterized by the presence of `` dynamical heterogeneities '' ( dh ) , in which the motion of atoms or molecules is highly spatially correlated .",
    "the presence of these dh is argued to give rise to the breakdown of the se relation  @xcite .",
    "since the derivation of the einstein relation assumes uncorrelated motion of particles , it is reasonable that the emergence of correlations could result in a failure of the se relation .",
    "the aim of the present work is to assess the validity of the se and sed relations in the spc / e model of water , and consider to what extent the dh contribute to the se and sed breakdown .",
    "computer simulations have been particularly useful for studying dh ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) since simulations have direct access to the details of the molecular motion . for water ,",
    "the existence of regions of enhanced or reduced mobility has also been identified  @xcite . in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite identifies the clusters of molecules with greater _ translational _ ( or center of mass ) mobility with the hypothesized `` cooperatively rearranging regions '' of the adam - gibbs approach  @xcite .",
    "most computer simulation studies on dh describe these heterogeneities based on the particle or molecule translational degrees of freedom .",
    "we will refer to these dh as translational heterogeneities ( th ) . for water ,",
    "it is also necessary to consider the rotational degrees of freedom of the molecule .",
    "recently , some computer simulation studies on molecular systems described the dh based on the molecular _ rotational _ degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "we will refer to these dh as rotational heterogeneities ( rh ) . for the case of a molecular model of water ,",
    "rh were studied  @xcite and it was found that rh and th are spatially correlated .",
    "this work extends those results .",
    "we find support for the idea that th are connected to the failure of the se relation , and further that rh have a similar effect on sed relation .",
    "additionally , we find that the breakdown of these relations is accompanied by the decoupling of the translational and rotational motion .",

    "[ eq : rsed ] both @xmath45 and @xmath46 will be temperature - independent if the se and sed relations are valid .    to evaluate @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we must first calculate the appropriate diffusion constants .",

    "a frequently employed approximation exploits the fact that @xmath5 is proportional to the shear stress relaxation time , @xmath56 , via the infinite frequency shear modulus , @xmath57 , which is nearly @xmath4-independent  @xcite .",
    "additionally , we expect that @xmath56 ( a `` collective property '' ) should be nearly proportional to other collective relaxation times , such as the relaxation time @xmath58 defined from the coherent intermediate scattering function , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the wave vector . therefore , we substitute @xmath5 by @xmath58 , which should only affect the value and units of the constants in the @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for the purposes of our calculations ,",
    "we define @xmath58 by fitting @xmath59 at long times with a `` stretched '' exponential [ eq : isf ] f(q , t)~ , where @xmath61 , and we focus on the @xmath60 value corresponding to the first peak in the static structure factor @xmath62 .",

    "whether there is a breakdown of the sed relation in experiments is not clear . while some experiments measuring dipole relaxation times show that the sed relation holds down to the glass transition  @xcite , other experiments  @xcite show that the sed relation fails for low @xmath4 .",
    "our simulations are in agreement with the breakdown of the sed ratio observed in , e.g. , ref .",
    "figures  [ dtaut](a ) and [ dtaut](b ) also show @xmath45 and @xmath46 for different subsets of molecules to examine the role played by dh .",
    "this is discussed in the following section .",
    "many theoretical approaches ( e.g.  @xcite ) attempt to explain the breakdown of se and/or sed in terms of dh . to this end , we must first describe the procedure used to select molecules whose motion ( or lack thereof ) is spatially correlated .",
    "a variety of approaches have been used to probe the phenomenon of dh .",
    "here we use one of the most common techniques : partitioning a system into mobility groups based on their rotational or translational maximum displacement .    for the th ,",
    "we define the translational mobility , @xmath63 , of a molecule @xmath64 at a given time @xmath65 and for an observation time @xmath66 , as the maximum displacement over the time interval @xmath67 $ ] of its oxygen atom [ eq : mobi ] _",
    "i(t_0,t)\\{|_i(t+t_0)-_i(t_0)| , t_0tt_0+t}. for the rh , following  @xcite , we define a rotational mobility that is analogous to the translational case . in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ eq : mobi ] ) , we define the rotational mobility at time @xmath65 with an observation time @xmath68 as _",
    "i(t_0,t)\\{|_i(t+t_0)-_i(t_0)| , t_0tt_0+t}. we identify the subsets of rotationally and translationally `` fastest '' molecules as the @xmath8 of the molecules with largest @xmath69 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "analogously , we identify the subsets of rotationally and translationally `` slowest '' molecules as the @xmath8 of the molecules with smallest @xmath69 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the choice of @xmath8 is made to have a direct comparison with the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , but the qualitative details of our work are unaffected by modest changes in this percentage . in the following",
    ", we will refer to these subsets of molecules as th and rh , fastest and slowest , depending on whether we consider the top or the bottom of the distribution of mobilities .",
    "we will see that comparing the fastest and the slowest molecules will reveal new features of dh .",
    "having identified subsets of highly mobile or immobile molecules , we can calculate the ratios @xmath45 and @xmath46 by limiting the evaluation of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath58 to these subsets .",
    "this is relatively straightforward for the diffusion constants , since they depend only on single molecule averages . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the situation is more complex since @xmath59 includes cross - correlations between molecules .",
    "hence we specialize the definition of @xmath59 for the th and rh subsets by introducing a definition that captures the cross - correlation within subsets and between a subset and rest of the system .",
    "we call this function @xmath70 , which we discuss in detail in appendix  [ sec : app2 ] .",
    "we show the value of @xmath45 and @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ dtaut](a ) and  [ dtaut](b ) for the cases when only the fastest and slowest subsets of molecules are considered .",
    "like the total system average , both the se and sed ratios for the subsets deviate at low @xmath4 from the corresponding constant value reached at high temperature .",
    "therefore , we observe that the breakdowns of both the se and sed relations occur not only in the subset of the fastest molecules , but also in the slowest . we have also confirmed a breakdown in intermediate subsets .",
    "the most mobile subset of molecules has a consistently greater value of @xmath71 and @xmath72 than the rest of the system , while the ratios for the least mobile subsets are always smaller .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the means by which we select the different subsets most strongly affects the diffusion constant ( see appendix  [ sec : app2 ] ) , and hence the differences in the se and sed ratios between the full system and the subsets are dominated by the diffusion constant , rather than by the relaxation time .    in order to compare the relative deviations of these curves from the se and sed predictions ,",
    "we normalize @xmath45 and @xmath46 by their respective high temperature values [ fig .",
    "[ dtaut](c ) and  [ dtaut](d ) ] .",
    "we observe that there is a collapse of all the curves ; thus , we conclude that both the most and least mobile molecules contribute in the same fashion to the breakdown of se and sed .",
    "moreover , this result supports the scenario that the deviation from the se and sed relations can not be attributed to only one particular subset of fastest / slowest molecules , but to all scales of translational and rotational mobility .",
    "we have confirmed this by looking at subsets of intermediate mobility ( not shown ) .",
    "therefore , we interpret our results as a sign of a generalized breakdown in the system under study , in contrast to a picture where only the most mobile molecules are the origin of the breakdown of se and sed , embedded in an inactive background where the se and sed equations hold  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . these results are consistent with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , who arrived at the same conclusion via a different analysis .",
    "when the se and sed relations fail , it is frequently observed that they can be replaced by _ fractional _ functional forms  @xcite @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "hence we test to what degree eqs .",
    "( [ eq : frac ] ) hold for our system . in fig .",
    "[ fractional ] we show a parametric plot of diffusivity versus @xmath76 for the entire system , and for the fastest and slowest molecules composing the th and rh .",
    "the results at low temperature are well fit with the fractional form of se and sed relations . from fig .  [ fractional ] ,",
    "@xmath77 for th is @xmath78 for fastest , slowest , and all , respectively , so all th have approximately the same exponent .",
    "similarly , for rh we find that @xmath79 is @xmath80 for fastest , slowest , and all , respectively .",
    "reference  @xcite found a stronger form of this fractional relation . specifically , ref .",
    "@xcite examined an `` ensemble '' of systems of the st2 water model at the same @xmath4 , which by statistical variation have fluctuations in the se and sed ratios .",
    "nonetheless , all systems collapsed to the same master curve when plotted in the parametric form shown in fig .",
    "[ fractional ] , meaning that the systems dominated by mobile or immobile molecules collapse to the same curve . while ref .",
    "@xcite employed a very different method ( small systems followed for shorter times ) , the conclusion of our fig .",
    "[ fractional ] is the same : a generalized deviation from se and sed .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fractional ] clearly shows that we do not find a general collapse in our present calculation . to understand why , we return to the fact that the method by which we define mobility affects much more strongly the diffusion constants than the coherent relaxation time , @xmath58 . as a result , it is impossible to have the data for the mobile and immobile subsets to collapse to a single master curve . to observe the same collapse ,",
    "presumably one needs a more `` neutral '' method for selecting the mobile particles  that is one that does not explicitly bias toward a specific property .",
    "unfortunately , such an approach is not obvious .",
    "however , we reproduced the ensemble approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , by splitting each of our 5 simulations into 3 trajectories .",
    "we obtain reasonable fluctuations that allow us to test and confirm ( not shown ) the observation of collapse of ref .",
    "hence , the phenomenon of homogeneous breakdown of se and sed appears to be robust for the different water models .",
    "the se and sed relations also imply a coupling between rotational and translational motion . specifically , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : se ] ) and ( [ eq : sed ] ) imply that the ratio = should remain constant as a function of temperature .",
    "since we have already seen that the se and sed ratios are not obeyed , it is likely that the ratio @xmath81 is also violated  @xcite .",
    "however , it is also possible that * @xmath81 * remains constant if both @xmath3 and @xmath2 deviate from their expected behavior in the same way .",
    "figure  [ ratio](a ) shows @xmath81 as a function of temperature .",
    "as @xmath4 decreases , we observe that @xmath81 increases , which implies that the breakdown of the sed relation is more pronounced than that of the se relation .",
    "experiments generally do not examine the behavior of @xmath81 since @xmath3 is not accessible .",
    "instead , @xmath3 is usually replaced by @xmath82 with @xmath83  @xcite . here , @xmath84 is the relaxation time of the rotational correlation function c_(t ) = p _ ( ) , where @xmath85 is the legendre polynomial of order @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is defined in appendix  [ sec : rotational - msd ] .",
    "figure  [ ratio](b ) shows @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "we observe that @xmath88 also shows a decoupling between rotational and translational motion .",
    "however , while @xmath81 _ increases _ upon cooling , @xmath88 _ decreases _ upon cooling .",
    "md simulations using an _ ortho_-terphenyl ( otp ) model  @xcite and the st2 water model  @xcite also find an opposite decoupling of the se and sed relations depending on whether @xmath3 or @xmath90 is used . in the simulations of otp",
    ", it was shown that the inverse relation between @xmath3 and @xmath90 fails due to the caging of the rotational motion ; this caging results in intermittent large rotations that are not accounted for by the debye approximation .",
    "similar to the analysis of the breakdown of the se and sed ratios , we can test whether dh play a strong role in the decoupling by examining the ratio @xmath81 for the different mobility subsets .",
    "this is slightly complicated by the fact that we can choose mixed mobility subsets when calculating the ratio .",
    "figure  [ ratiodh ] shows that the ratio @xmath81 for all choices of mobility subsets approximately coincide when scaled by the high temperature behavior of @xmath81 .",
    "this indicates that ( like the breakdown of the se and sed relations ) the decoupling is uniform across the subsets of mobility .",
    "the se and sed relations depend on @xmath91 and @xmath5 , which are defined only in the asymptotic limit of infinite time .",
    "in contrast , the time scale on which dh exist is finite , and generally shorter that the time scale on which the system becomes diffusive . as a result ,",
    "making the connection between dh and the breakdown of se and sed expressions is difficult . to address this complication ,",
    "we incorporate a time dependence in the se and sed relations , so that we can evaluate these relations at the time scale of the dh .",
    "this point has been neglected so far in the literature . to define time - dependent versions of the se and sed ratios , we first define time - dependent diffusivities d_t(t ) , d_r(t ) , and we also define time - dependent relaxation times ( t)_t^t+tf(q , t)dt. note that @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the limit @xmath94 .",
    "the definition of @xmath95 requires some explanation : @xmath95 is the time integral of the intermediate scattering function , and @xmath95 will be proportional to the standard relaxation time @xmath58 [ eq .  ( [ eq : isf ] ) ] in the limit @xmath94 .",
    "there is a constant of proportionality resulting from the stretched exponential form  @xcite .",
    "when , instead , a dh is considered , @xmath96 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqtsubset ] ) ] is used in the computation of @xmath95 .",
    "we choose these definitions since , in the limit @xmath94 , they converge or are proportional to the corresponding time - independent definitions .",

    "allows one to verify quantitatively the role of the time scale in the se / sed ratios . to contrast the behavior of @xmath97 with the average over the entire system ,",
    "we define the time dependent `` breakdown '' ratios as follows : b_dh(t ) [ b_dh ] where dh refers to th or rh .",
    "if the dh are related to the breakdown of the se and sed relations , then one would expect that : ( i ) the @xmath98 and @xmath99 ratios will show the largest deviations from the system average behavior at the time scale when dh are most pronounced , i.e. approximately at a time which we denote as @xmath100 , at which the non - gaussian parameter is a maximum ( see appendix  [ sec : times ] ) .",

    "we next directly probe the relation between dh and the decoupling of @xmath3 and @xmath2 . as discussed above ,",

    "figure  [ phi - r](a ) shows the results for @xmath105 for the fastest subsets of molecules . for short times ,",

    "the fact that @xmath105 shows a maximum at approximately @xmath100 , while @xmath108 shows a minimum at @xmath100 is because fastest subsets of rh tend to enhance the rotational motion with respect to the translational motion , while the opposite situation occurs for the fastest subsets of th .",
    "we note from fig .",
    "[ phi - r](b ) that @xmath111 , indicating that the decoupling of rotational and translational motion observed in the fastest subsets of rh is larger than that found in the average over the entire system .    in short ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath105 and @xmath108 indicates that the emergence of dh is correlated to the rotation / translation decoupling , just as it does for the breakdown of the se and sed relations .",
    "in this work , we tested in the spc / e model for water ( i ) the validity of the se and sed equations , ( ii ) the decoupling of rotational and translational motion , and ( iii ) the relation of ( i ) and ( ii ) to dh .",
    "we found that at low temperatures there is a breakdown of both the se and sed relations and that these relations can be replaced by fractional functional forms .",
    "the se breakdown is observed in every scale of translational mobility .",
    "similarly , the sed breakdown is observed in every scale of rotational mobility .",
    "thus our results support the view of a generalized breakdown , instead of a view where only the most mobile molecules are the origin of the breakdown of the se and sed relations , embedded in an inactive background where these relations hold .",
    "we also found that , upon cooling , there is a decoupling of translational and rotational motion .",
    "this decoupling is also observed in all scales of rotational and translational mobilities . in agreement with md simulations of an otp model  @xcite",
    ", we find that an opposite decoupling is observed depending on whether one uses the rotational diffusivity , @xmath3 , or the rotational relaxation time , @xmath90 . in the first case ,",
    "rotational motion is enhanced upon cooling with respect to the translational motion , while the opposite situation holds when choosing @xmath90 .",
    "this is particularly relevant for experiments , where typically only @xmath90 is accessible .",
    "we also found that as the decoupling of @xmath81 increases , the number of molecules belonging simultaneously to both rh and th also increases .",
    "this is counter - intuitive since a stronger decoupling would suggest less overlapping of th and rh .",
    "therefore we conclude that the decoupling of @xmath81 is significant even at the single molecule level .",
    "we also explored the role of time scales in the breakdown of the se and sed relations and decoupling . to do this we introduced time dependent versions of the se and sed expressions .",
    "our results suggest that both the decoupling and se and sed breakdowns are originated at the time scale corresponding to the end of the cage regime , when diffusion starts .",
