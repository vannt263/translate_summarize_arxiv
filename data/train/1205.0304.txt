    "the purpose of this paper is to show how different properties of a data set affect the results from using a method developed in a previous paper ( speights & westpfahl 2011 , hereafter paper i ) for solving the pattern speed ( @xmath0 ) equations of tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 , hereafter tw84 ) .",
    "this is important for choosing data in future applications of the solution method , with the long - term goal of determining whether spiral patterns are rigidly rotating waves , shearing material arms , or perhaps some combination of both .",
    "the pattern speed is traditionally determined from a guided interpretation of observations according to the density wave theory ( lin & shu 1964 , 1966 ; lin et al .",
    "1969 ) . in density wave theory",
    "@xmath0 is a free parameter that is measurable by assuming that it is constant ( i.e. , independent of radius ) , and that resonant radii are identifiable from photometric and kinematic features of the galaxy .",
    "resonance is assumed to occur when @xmath0 = @xmath1 , the material speed ( corotation resonance ) , and when @xmath0 = @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3/@xmath4 , where @xmath3 is the epicycle frequency of a stellar orbit and @xmath4 is the mode of the wave corresponding to the number of arms ( lindblad resonance ) . the assumption that @xmath0 is constant is appealing if one assumes that spiral patterns persist for many dynamical ( orbital ) timescales because this avoids the winding dilemma for material arms .    the tw84 equations ,",
    "however , are independent of the detailed assumptions of spiral structure theories , and solutions can be used to test those assumptions .",
    "these are integrated forms of the continuity equation that relate the pattern speed to the observable kinematic and density properties of a pattern tracer .",
    "the derivation in tw84 assumes that the disk is flat , that the pattern speed is well defined , and that the pattern tracer obeys the continuity equation .    in paper",
    "i the tw84 equations are solved for a pattern speed that is allowed to vary with radius .",
    "the solution method is then applied to the h1.5pt i spiral pattern of the barred , grand - design galaxy ngc 1365 .",
    "a statistical analysis of the results rules out the hypothesis of a constant @xmath0 for the spiral arms .",
    "the pattern speed behaves approximately as 1/@xmath5 , and is very similar to the material speed .",
    "there are also no clear indications of unique corotation or lindblad resonances for the spiral arms .",
    "it is noted in paper i that the winding dilemma is avoidable for ngc 1365 if the spiral pattern is a transient feature .",
    "the results for ngc 1365 are inconsistent with traditional methods for measuring spiral arm pattern speeds .",
    "more direct measurements that allow for a radially varying @xmath0 are therefore needed in order to estimate how common shearing patterns are .",
    "there is an abundant amount of archived data for doing so , and a better understanding of how different properties of a data set affect the results will help with selecting useful data .",
    "this paper reports the results from applying the solution method of paper i to the grand - design galaxy ngc 3031 , the irregular galaxy ngc 2366 , and the dwarf irregular galaxy ddo 154 .",
    "four different data sets of ngc 3031 show how angular resolution , spectral resolution , and sensitivities to structures on different scales affect the results .",
    "the pattern speed is found for ngc 2366 and ddo 154 to show how the results are affected in the absence of a coherent or well - organized pattern .",
    "the results for the irregular galaxies also provide a counterexample to the results for ngc 3031 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the solution method developed in paper",
    "i is briefly reviewed , and a new procedure is introduced for selecting models that are an alternative to a constant @xmath0 . in section 3 the method of analyzing the results is explained . in section 4",
    "the data are described . in section 5",
    "the results are presented and analyzed . in section 6",
    "the results are discussed . in section 7",
    "is a summary .",
    "when @xmath0 is allowed to vary with radius in the tw84 equations one of the results is an integral equation , @xmath6 that is solvable for simple functional forms of @xmath0 . in equation",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath7 is the intensity of a pattern tracer and @xmath8 is the line of sight velocity of the tracer ( corrected for the systemic velocity , @xmath9 ) times the cosecant of the disk inclination , @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 coordinates are measured relative to the kinematic minor and major axis respectively . for an illustration showing how a galaxy disk is oriented in the coordinate system of equation ( 1 ) ,",
    "see figure ( 1 ) in paper i.    the two forms of @xmath0 that are used in paper i for solving equation ( 1 ) are a polynomial in @xmath5 = @xmath13 , @xmath14 and a polynomial in 1/@xmath5 , @xmath15 where that @xmath16 is an integer and @xmath17 are unknown coefficients that are determined in a solution . both equations ( 2 ) and",
    "( 3 ) can represent a constant @xmath0 when @xmath16 = 0 , and higher order terms can be used to determine whether the pattern is rigid or shearing . determining the order at which point it is appropriate to truncate the summations in equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is the primary goal of the analysis in paper i.    the advantage of using such forms for @xmath0 is that the unknown coefficients can come out of the integral on the left hand side of equation ( 1 ) . using equation ( 2 ) , equation ( 1 )",
    "becomes , @xmath18 or similarly using equation ( 3 ) , @xmath19 applying either equation ( 4 ) or ( 5 ) independently ( i.e. , at least a beam size apart in the case of radio synthesis maps ) to different parts of the galaxy transforms the integral equation into a matrix equation of the form @xmath20 = @xmath21 .",
    "that the calculations are independent is important because this is assumed in the methods used for estimating and propagating uncertainties , and in the statistics used for analyzing the results .",
    "the matrix equation is easily solved using the normal equations , @xmath22 = @xmath23 , for the linear least - squares problem .",
    "methods for the analysis of the results for linear least - squares problems are well established , and this is another advantage of using such forms for @xmath0 .    the results for ngc 1365 demonstrate that only a few terms are needed in the above polynomials in order to determine the radial behavior of @xmath0 . including many terms",
    "can unnecessarily complicate the analysis , and by @xmath24 = 3 the matrix @xmath25 typically becomes ill - conditioned for numerical inversion .",
    "when @xmath25 is ill - conditioned , the solution is unstable , and any inferences based on such solutions may be unreliable . by summing equations ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) to order @xmath16",
    "= 3 one can infer whether there is any sign of a discontinuity in @xmath0 such as a step function .",
    "this is useful in paper i because the bar in ngc 1365 may have a separate @xmath0 than that of the spiral arms ( sellwood & sparke 1988 ; sellwood 1993 and references therein ) , and it needed to be shown whether the pattern speed of the bar is detected in the results .    since the pattern of ngc 3031 shows no obvious discontinuities or signs of a bar ( see figures 1 through 4 ) , and in order to simplify the analysis for all three galaxies , only two terms are used in this paper as an alternative to a constant @xmath0 model .",
    "the alternative models have the form , @xmath26 but without the restriction to integer values of @xmath16 . relaxing the restriction to integer values of @xmath16",
    "allows for different amounts of curvature in @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath16 is determined by comparing the goodness of fit for solutions of equation ( 1 ) using equation ( 6 ) and a range of different values for @xmath16 . for each solution , the distribution of the residuals , normalized by the propagated uncertainties ,",
    "is compared with a standard normal distribution .",
    "if one assumes that the uncertainties are well known , the distribution of the normalized residuals will be a standard normal distribution when the true form of @xmath0 is used to find a solution .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath16 that results in a distribution of the normalized residuals that is the most similar to a standard normal distribution is used to chose an alternative model for subsequent analysis .    a kolmogorov - smirnov ( @xmath27 )",
    "test is used to quantify how similar the distribution of the normalized residuals is to a standard normal distribution .",
    "the @xmath27 test consists of finding the largest distance between two cumulative distribution functions ( cdf ) , @xmath28 = max@xmath29cdf(@xmath30 ) @xmath31 cdf(@xmath32)@xmath29 , where that in this case @xmath30 is the distribution of the normalized residuals and @xmath32 is a standard normal distribution .",
    "then , the probability , @xmath33 , is found for obtaining a value of @xmath28 should the null hypothesis be true that @xmath30 is a standard normal distribution ( kendall & stewart 1973 , chapter 30 ; lupton 1993 , chapter 19 ) . if @xmath33 is sufficiently small , then there is convincing evidence that @xmath30 @xmath34 @xmath32 , and one can infer that the model in question is not the true model .",
    "the following convention is adopted for interpreting values of @xmath33 : @xmath33 @xmath35 @xmath36 is convincing evidence that @xmath30 @xmath34 @xmath32 ; @xmath33 @xmath37 @xmath38 is suggestive of @xmath30 @xmath34 @xmath32 , but inconclusive ; and larger values can not rule out the null hypothesis that @xmath30 is a standard normal distribution . in this paper a lower limit of 0.01% is chosen as a cutoff for reporting small probabilities . as a compliment to",
    "the analysis explained in the next section , the @xmath27 test is also applied to the results from using a constant @xmath0 model .",
    "for the purpose of determining @xmath16 , a larger value of @xmath33 is considered an indication that the distribution of the normalized residuals is more similar to a standard normal distribution . in section 5",
    "it is shown that two peaks consistently occur in plots of @xmath33 vs @xmath16 , one each for negative and positive values of @xmath16 .",
    "the results are analyzed for each case , where the model using a negative value of @xmath16 = @xmath39 is referred to as alternative model 1 ( am1 ) , and the model using a positive value of @xmath16 = @xmath40 is referred to as alternative model 2 ( am2 ) .",
    "the goal of the analysis is to determine whether the pattern is rigid or shearing .",
    "this is based on a comparison of reduced chi - square ( @xmath41 for @xmath42 degrees of freedom ) for a solution using a constant @xmath0 model with the values obtained for am1 and am2 .",
    "unless otherwise noted in section 5 , the validity of using @xmath41 as an indicator of the goodness of fit is based on the results of a lilliefors test for quantifying how similar @xmath30 is to a normal distribution . the lilliefors test follows the same procedure as the @xmath27 test , with the difference that @xmath28 = max@xmath29cdf(@xmath30 ) @xmath31 cdf(@xmath43)@xmath29 , where that @xmath43 is a normal distribution with a mean and a standard deviation that is the same as that for @xmath30 ( mandansky 1988 , chapter 1 ) .",
    "if the probability , @xmath44 , of obtaining @xmath28 is sufficiently small , then @xmath30 may not have a normal distribution , and the value of @xmath41 may not be a reliable indicator of the goodness of fit .",
    "the same convention that is adopted for interpreting values of @xmath33 is adopted for interpreting values of @xmath44 .",
    "if a solution using am1 or am2 has a value of @xmath41 that is an improvement to the value of @xmath41 for the constant @xmath0 model , then fisher s @xmath45 test of an additional term is used to determine if the improvement is statistically significant .",
    "the @xmath45 test is a natural choice for quantifying the significance of the improvement in @xmath41 because the constant @xmath0 model is a reduced version of am1 and am2 .",
    "the @xmath45 test consists of calculating @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47/@xmath48 and finding the probability , @xmath49 , for obtaining such a value of @xmath45 should the null hypothesis be true that the extra term , @xmath50 , is zero ( bevington & robinson 2002 , chapter 10 ) .",
    "if @xmath51 is sufficiently small , then there is convincing evidence that @xmath52 @xmath34 0 , and one can infer that the pattern is shearing . if such evidence is found then the result for the constant @xmath0 model is the mean of @xmath0 . the following convention is adopted for interpreting values of @xmath49 : @xmath49 @xmath35 @xmath36 is convincing evidence that @xmath52 @xmath34 0 ; @xmath49 @xmath37 @xmath38 is suggestive of @xmath52 @xmath34 0 , but inconclusive ; and larger values are an indication that the improvement is not statistically significant .",
    "the uncertainties for calculating @xmath41 , confidence intervals for the coefficients , and confidence bands for @xmath0 , are estimated by propagating the uncertainties per pixel in the maps of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as well as the uncertainties in @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath10 , and @xmath53 through the calculations of both * g * and * d*. the method of estimating the uncertainties in the maps of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are adopted from the reasoning given in paper i. this takes into account the rms noise , the channel width , and the number of channels a typical detection occurs .",
    "the total uncertainty for the @xmath54th independent calculation of equation ( 1 ) is @xmath55 @xmath46 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 ( bevington & robinson 2002 , chapter 6 ) .",
    "the confidence intervals and confidence bands are not estimated using the covariance matrix because of the uncertainties in * g*. instead , these are estimated using monte carlo methods .    an incorrect value for the position angle of the disk ( pa ) can potentially cause large errors in solutions of the tw84 equations ( debattista 2003 ; debattista & williams 2004 ) .",
    "the pa does not explicitly appear in equation ( 1 ) , and consequently the uncertainty in the pa is not accounted for in the calculation of the propagated uncertainties . how an incorrect pa could affect the conclusions in this paper is investigated in section 5 by changing the pa and applying the solution method and analysis .",
    "this is done for a range of -2@xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61pa @xmath60 2@xmath59 where that @xmath59 is the 1@xmath62 uncertainty for the adopted pa . in paper",
    "i it is explained that this method is preferred to monte carlo methods because monte carlo methods typically produce non - gaussian results for the distributions of the coefficients .    in order to minimize the uncertainties in the analysis , instrumental units of [ @xmath0 ]",
    "= km s@xmath64 arcsec@xmath64 are used for solving equation ( 1 ) and analyzing the results .",
    "this is preferred to units commonly used for galactic disks , [ @xmath0 ] = km s@xmath64 kpc@xmath64 , because the conversion from arcseconds to kpc adds a large amount of uncertainty to @xmath11 and @xmath12 owing to the uncertainty in the distance to the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , units commonly used for galactic disks are not necessary for the purpose of this paper .",
    "radio synthesis intensity and velocity maps of h1.5pt i are used for applying the solution method . for a discussion of the advantages of using h1.5pt i as a pattern tracer the interested reader",
    "is referred to paper i. although tw84 use a form of the continuity equation that assumes mass conservation , the tw84 equations are derivable form the general form of the continuity equation that includes a source function for the creation and destruction of material ( westpfahl 1998 ) . if the source function is constant within dynamical timescales , then it does not affect the calculation of the pattern speed ( paper i ) .",
    "for the purpose of this paper it is assumed that the source function is approximately constant within dynamical timescales .",

    "similar to most of the other plots , however , @xmath33 is small near @xmath16 = 0 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath33 for the constant @xmath0 model is the largest of the values of @xmath33 shown in table 3 for the constant @xmath0 model .",
    "it is too large to rule out the null hypothesis that the distribution of the normalized residuals is a standard normal distribution for the constant @xmath0 model .",
    "plots of @xmath0 calculated from the coefficients are shown in figure 12 .",
    "the material speed in the figure is calculated from the rotation curve by oh et al .",
    "all three models of @xmath0 are quite similar in the outer half of the disk .",
    "the plots for the constant @xmath0 model and am2 are consistent with each other to within their 95% confidence bands . the plot for am1 differs from the other two by showing corotation in the central part of the galaxy .",
    "none of the plots show corotation at @xmath37 100@xmath99 .",
    "the values of @xmath49 in table 5 for am1 and am2 are small enough to rule out the null hypothesis that @xmath52 = 0 .",
    "this result for am2 may be unreliable because the results of a lllliefors test applied to its normalized residuals is inconclusive ( @xmath44 = 4.62% ) .",
    "also note that the solution for this model has a value of @xmath78 that is smaller than 1 by more than 2@xmath62 . from the results for the @xmath45 test , the results of the @xmath27 test for the constant @xmath0 model , and the plots of @xmath0 , the clumps of h1.5pt i in ddo 154 are corotating in the central and outer parts of the disk .",
    "some of the clumps of h1.5pt i at @xmath37 100@xmath99 are rotating more slowly than the material .",
    "the result for the constant @xmath0 model is the mean of @xmath0 .",
    "figure 13 shows how an incorrect pa could affect the conclusions for ddo 154 .",
    "the results for ddo 154 are much more dependent on the value of the adopted pa than are the results for ngc 3031 or ngc 2366 .",
    "the values of @xmath40 vary by as much as a factor of 6 .",
    "the values of @xmath78 vary by almost as much , with the smallest values occurring around @xmath61pa @xmath37 0@xmath68 .",
    "there are values of @xmath61pa where that the results of the @xmath45 test are inconclusive , or that @xmath45 is too small to rule out the null hypothesis that @xmath52 = 0 .",
    "the results for the constant @xmath0 model deviates quite significantly beyond the 95% confidence intervals for the value obtained using the adopted pa .",
    "it must be concluded that the accuracy of the adopted pa affects some of the conclusions for ddo 154 , particularly whether the solution using a constant @xmath0 model , or one of the alternative models , provides a better solution for equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the previous section shows the results from applying the solution method to data sets with different angular resolutions , spectral resolutions , and sensitivities to structures on different scales .",
    "results are also shown for galaxies without coherent or well - organized patterns . knowing how these properties of a data set affect the results is important for choosing data in future applications of the solution method .",
    "of all the differences in the data sets , the angular resolution had the most noticeable affect on the results by setting the number of independent calculations of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the most extreme cases can be seen in figure 8 for the ngc 3031 data sets .",
    "the results for the yp99 data set demonstrate that a constant @xmath0 , or the mean if there is evidence for a radial dependence , can be found with only 4 independent calculations of equation ( 1 ) , but more calculations would be desirable in order to reduce the uncertainty . in order to determine whether there is a single , global pattern speed ( i.e.",
    ", @xmath0 is the same in different regions of a galaxy ) , a number of independent calculations similar to what was used for aw96b and ngc 2366 should be sufficient , given similar uncertainties .",
    "there is no noticeable affect on the results due to spectral resolution .",
    "consistent results were obtained for the aw96a and h84 data sets despite a factor of @xmath37 4 difference in the channel separation . also consider that results with small uncertainties were obtained in paper i for ngc 1365 using maps made from a 20.84 km s@xmath64 channel separation .",
    "the large channel separation for the ngc 1365 data may have been compensated for by having 62 independent calculations of equation ( 1 ) for the whole disk .",
    "the results for the three different data sets of ngc 3031 are remarkably consistent despite their different sensitivities to structures on different scales .",
    "the results for the aw96a and h84 data sets are almost identical even though they are more sensitive to small and large scales , respectively , and the aw96a data set is missing some flux .",
    "the results for the data sets of ngc 3031 with the largest angular resolution , aw96b and yp99 , are slightly less than the results for aw96a and h84 .",
    "the smaller number of independent calculations of equation ( 1 ) for the aw96b and yp99 data sets , and consequently larger uncertainties , may be the cause for this small difference .",
    "the results for ngc 2366 and ddo 154 demonstrate that the solution method can produce meaningful results that are simple to interpretin the absence of a coherent or well - organized pattern .",
    "this shows that the solution method is not limited to grand - design patterns .",
    "it could be used to find @xmath0 for multiple armed and flocculent spiral galaxies as well . for these types of spiral galaxies",
    "the solution method would be measuring @xmath0 for different arms , or clumps of higher density material .",
    "although this may violate the assumption of a well - defined pattern speed by tw84 ( i.e. , the surface brightness is assumed to be constant in a frame rotating at an angular speed @xmath0 ) , the tw84 equations are generalizable to a frame that is rotating at a variable angular speed @xmath0(@xmath5 ) ( engstrm 1994 ) . whether the results for galaxies without a coherent or well - organized pattern have any physical meaning",
    "can be determined using a variety of statistical tools such as @xmath41 and the lilliefor s test used in this paper . a very large or small value of @xmath41 , or a small enough value of @xmath100 for the normalized residuals , could mean that equation ( 1 ) is a poor description of the dynamics of a galaxy , or part of a galaxy , for example .",
    "this paper shows that having a sufficient number of independent calculations is important for applying the solution method .",
    "this limits the use of h1.5pt i radio synthesis data to nearby galaxies .",
    "for example , the resolution of the c - array of the vla for h1.5pt i observing , which has a typical fwhm of @xmath37 13@xmath70 for the synthesized beam , would be adequate for many nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "radio synthesis data for tracers of molecular gas , which have a higher frequency , and thus a smaller synthesized beam ( typically as small as sub arcsecond to a few arcseconds at @xmath37 100 ghz ) , would be useful for applying the method to more distant galaxies that have a smaller angular size .",
    "the resolution of optical data , such as fabry - perot h@xmath101 data , is typically @xmath37 1@xmath70 - 2@xmath70 due to atmospheric seeing .",
    "such data would also expand the applicability of the solution method to galaxies with a smaller angular size .",
    "there is convincing evidence in the form of the @xmath45 test that the spiral pattern in ngc 3031 is shearing .",
    "in fact , the values of @xmath45 are quite large .",
    "this confirms the discovery of shear in the pattern by westpfahl ( 1998 ) .",
    "the pattern speed is very similar to the material speed , and there are no clear indications of unique corotation or lindblad resonances .",
    "the same conclusions were found for the spiral pattern of ngc 1365 .",
    "note that the results of the @xmath45 test are complimented by the results of the @xmath27 test for the constant @xmath0 model , from which it can be inferred that the constant @xmath0 model is not the true model .",
    "it is important to point out that these findings for both ngc 3031 and ngc 1365 are based on calculations that are independent of the assumptions made in spiral structure theories .",
    "the results for ngc 3031 are similar to the sheared gravitational instabilities of goldreich & lynden - bell ( 1965 ) and the swing amplifier of toomre ( 1981 ) .",
    "close passage of the companion galaxies ngc 3034 and ngc 3077 could have caused the swing amplification in ngc 3031 .",
    "several models agree that these galaxies passed to within 20 kpc of ngc 3031 about 600 myr ago ( van der hulst 1977 ; cottrell 1976 , 1977 ; gottesman & weliachew 1975 , 1977 ; and brouillet et al .",
    "simulations show that such interactions can produce grand design patterns that shear over time ( s. oh 2008 ; dobbs et al .",
    "2010 ; struck et al .",
    "this implies that the spiral pattern in ngc 3031 is a transient feature that is driven by interactions with its companions , and in this way the winding dilemma is avoided .    the results in this paper and in paper i are part of a growing body of evidence that some grand - design spiral patterns are shearing , transient features .",
    "some of this evidence is coming from simulations , which have yet to produce persisting patterns ( e.g. , berman et al .",
    "1978 ; sellwood & carlberg 1984 ; sorensen 1985 ; bottema 2003 ; dobbs & bonnell 2008 ; s. oh et al . 2008",
    "; dobbs et al . 2010 ; struck et al .",
    "2011 ; wada et al . 2011",
    "; sellwood 2011 for a review ) . of the more recent simulations , wada et al .",
    "( 2011 ) showed that the shearing , short lived ( @xmath37 100 myr ) , recurring spiral arms in their simulations of a live disk have a pattern speed that is similar to the material speed .",
    "simulations are useful tools for forming hypothesis about spiral structure , but a true understanding must ultimately come from observations . in paper",
    "i it was pointed out that the original solution method of tw84 produced results for at least 7 nearby spiral galaxies that are consistent with a shearing pattern .",
    "foyle et al . ( 2011 ) also found evidence against long - lived , rigidly rotating patterns in spiral galaxies .",
    "they showed that the angular offsets between star formation tracers in 11 nearby spiral galaxies , including ngc 3031 , are not systemically ordered as predicted from a long - lived , rigidly rotating pattern .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile the findings in this paper for ngc 3031 with the density wave theory .",
    "all versions of the theory use as a foundation the premise that the pattern is rotating approximately rigidly ( bertin & lin 1996 , chapter 2 ; bertin 2000 , chapter 15 ; binney & tremaine 2008 , chapter 6 ) .",
    "one possibility is that @xmath0 is a step function , as advocated for by meidt et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and meidt et al .",
    "the solution method used in this paper would not be able to detect such step functions because continuity is assumed for am1 and am2 .",
    "the forms used in paper i , however , are capable of detecting such step functions , and did not find evidence for this form of @xmath0 in the spiral pattern of ngc 1365 .",
    "the same forms of @xmath0 used in paper i were also tried for the ngc 3031 data sets , and there is no sign of a step function .",
    "most importantly , note that there are no discontinuities in the spiral pattern of ngc 3031 as one would expect if @xmath0 is indeed a step function .",
    "in this paper the method derived in paper i for solving the pattern speed equations of tw84 is applied to ngc 3031 , ngc 2366 , and ddo 154 in order to show how different properties of a data set affect the results .",
    "the conclusions are as follows :        -10.5pt four different data sets of ngc 3031 produce consistent results despite differences in angular resolution , spectral resolution , and sensitivities to structures on different scales .",
    "they all produce convincing evidence for shear in the pattern .",
    "the pattern speed is more similar to the material speed than it is to the speed of a rigidly rotating pattern .",
    "there are no unique points of corotation or 2-arm lindblad resonances .",
    "-10.5pt the angular resolution had the most noticeable affect on the results by setting the number of independent calculations of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "this is important to consider when selecting data for future      0.1pt applications of the solution method , especially for determining the radial behavior of @xmath0 , and whether there is a single , global pattern speed .",
    "lower angular resolution data sets give few independent rows of data , so are less useful for determining @xmath0 as a function of radius .              -10.5pt",
    "the results for ngc 2366 and ddo 154 show that meaningful results that are simple to interpret can be obtained even in the absence of a coherent or well organized pattern .",
    "the results for these galaxies also demonstrate that the solution method is not merely measuring the material speed , and thus serve as a counterexample to the results for ngc 3031 .",
    "the authors acknowledge the helpful comments of the referee that improved this paper .",
    "the authors also acknowledge erwin de blok and se - heon oh for providing the rotation curve data and the uncertainties of the orientation parameters for ngc 3031 , ngc 2366 , and ddo 154 .",
    "renee andrae , tim shulze - hartung , and peter melchoir provided some of the inspiration for the procedure used in this paper for finding models that are an alternative to a constant @xmath0 .",
