    "in the unifying scheme for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) it is postulated that an `` obscuring torus '' usually surrounds the accreting massive black hole .",
    "models predict that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a torus depends sensitively on its orientation , geometry , and density distribution ( veilleux 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the tori are predicted to exhibit prominent silicate dust features in either absorption or emission , depending on whether an agn is viewed with the torus edge - on ( type  2 ) or face - on ( type  1 ) .",
    "many type  2 agn do indeed exhibit silicate absorption features .",
    "however , until very recently type  1 objects have not shown any clear evidence of silicate features , neither in emission nor in absorption ( e.g.  clavel et al . 2000 ) . in uniform density torus models with standard dust , suppression of the silicate features occurs for only a very narrow range of model parameters . to account for the non - detections clumpy torus models or tapered disks have been invoked ( e.g. , nenkova et al . 2002 , efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 ) , and larger grain sizes have been postulated ( e.g. , laor & draine 1993 ; maiolino et al .",

    ". we also comment on detections in more luminous agn in our sample , with luminosities up to 10@xmath3 greater than in ngc3998 .",
    "ngc3998 is an s0 galaxy at a distance of 14.1 mpc ( tonry et al .",
    "the optical line ratios are typical of low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ) . because of a broad h@xmath4 component ( ho et al .",

    "the 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity of ngc3998 is  3x10@xmath5 erg / s ( ptak et al . 2004 ) .",
    "a strong uv point source was detected by hst ( fabbiano et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the uv source is variable indicating agn accretion , as opposed to a stellar , energy source ( maoz et al .",
    "our data were obtained with the spitzer irs ( houck et al .",
    "2004 ; werner et al . 2004 ) as part of our go cycle-1 project on liners . for comparison",
    "we also consider pg qsos which are part of our medium size go cycle-1 program on quasar and ulirg evolution ( quest ; pi : s. veilleux ) .",
    "the objects were observed in three low and high resolution irs modules : short low ( s0 ) , short high ( s1 ) and long high ( s3 ) .",
    "our data reduction started with the two - dimensional bcd products from the spitzer pipeline ( s11 ) .",
    "we used our own idl routines for de - glitching and sky subtraction , and smart ( higdon et al .",
    "2004 ) for extraction of the final spectrum .",
    "the sed of ngc3998 is characterized by a well - detected warm continuum with clear broad emission features in the 9 - 13@xmath1 m and 15 - 20@xmath1 m range ( fig .",

    "pah dust emission features are absent .",
    "the spectrum also exhibits a number of ionic emission lines ( omitted in fig .",
    "1 ) , that will be analyzed elsewhere .    siebenmorgen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have suggested that the failure to detect silicate emission in agn in earlier missions could be explained as luminosity dependence , because the only detections so far have been in highly luminous ( but apparently faint ) quasars .",
    "our detection of a prominent silicate feature in a liner with an agn luminosity 4 to 5 orders of magnitude below those of quasars is clear evidence against this hypothesis .",
    "silicate emission can be equally strong in low luminosity agn ( see the comparison in fig .",
    "[ f : n3998 ] ) .",
    "the agn in which silicate emissions have been reported to date are listed in table  [ tab : agncollection ] .",
    "this emission is present for a large range of intrinsic 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity .",
    "our quest and liner programs are beginning to provide additional observations .",
    "although only a fraction of these observations have been taken or analyzed so far , these surveys provide an early indication of the prevalence of silicate emissions in agn .",
    "they appear in a majority of our optically selected qsos ( with 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosities ranging from @xmath610@xmath7 to 10@xmath8 erg / s ) but in only a small fraction of liners ( 1 out of 10 ) . in many liners ( but not in ngc3998 ) and",
    "seyferts the analysis is complicated by confusion with strong pah emission , requiring a careful decomposition of the spectra into the various components .",
    "this will make determining the prevalence and characteristics of silicate emission challenging .    in fig .",

    "( 2005 ) sample , using their continuum subtracted spectrum . for ngc3998 we subtracted the continuum by fitting a spline ( see fig .",
    "[ f : n3998 ] ) through the continuum points in the 7 - 8@xmath1 m and 25 - 35@xmath1 m ranges . without any further scaling the two spectra are virtually identical in the 10@xmath1 m feature , but at wavelengths @xmath220@xmath1 m they deviate significantly from each other .",
    "the other qso spectra also match the shape of the 10@xmath1 m feature but the peak wavelength varies between  10 and  11.5@xmath1 m .",
    "all are different from ngc 3998 at longer wavelengths .",
    "we now compare the 10@xmath1 m profile in ngc3998 with feature `` templates '' from various astronomical environments .",
    "figure [ f : comp_templates]a shows a comparison to normal ism silicate emission ( kemper et al .",
    "clearly , the normal ism profile is not a good fit . the ism silicate profile peaks at @xmath09.8@xmath1 m , and it is narrower than in ngc3998 .",
    "siebenmorgen et al . and hao et al .",
    "try to fit the broadened and shifted profiles by folding ism dust opacities with steeply rising ( cold ) planck functions . however , in ngc3998 this can not be the full explanation ( fig .  [",
    "f : comp_templates]c ) .",
    "while the relative intensities of the 10/18 peaks in ngc3998 can be reproduced by such a fit with a temperature of @xmath0180k , the emission in the blue wing of the 10@xmath1 m feature and longwards of @xmath020@xmath1 m is significantly over - predicted .",
    "[ f : comp_templates]a also shows a template spectrum for enhanced grain sizes ( van boekel et al .",
    "an increase in the grain size clearly shifts and broadens the profile .",
    "van boekel et al .",
    "have used such templates to fit silicate emission profiles of young stellar objects ( herbig be stars ) .",
    "they found that none of the stellar sources consist of fully pristine dust comparable to that found in the ism , and that larger grain sizes and/or crystallization due to dust processing are necessary to fit the spectra . in fig .",
    "[ f : comp_templates]b we show a comparison of ngc3998 with the herbig be star hd163296 ( meeus et al .",
    "the shapes of the two 10@xmath1 m _ profiles _ match quite well ; the emission _ peak _ in ngc3998 is shifted towards longer wavelengths , however .    while an increased average grain size of amorphous silicates ( olivine , pyroxene ) can move the feature as a whole , an increased admixture of crystalline silicates ( fosterites , enstatites ) would result in an additional , relatively sharp peak at 11.3@xmath1 m and further features at longer wavelengths ( e.g. meeus et al . 2001 ) . within the s",
    "/ n limits we do not see clear evidence for such peaks in ngc3998 . we note , however , that other species of crystalline silicates , like clino - pyroxenes , produce weaker discrete features and would also be consistent with the faster decline at @xmath018@xmath1 m ( wooden et al .",
    ".    the feature profile may also be sensitive to the chemical composition .",
    "for instance , iso spectra of carbon - rich environments around red giants revealed strong emission of sic around 11.2@xmath1 m ( e.g. aoki et al . 1999 ) , which looks very reminiscent of the features studied here .",
    "jaffe et al . ( 2004 ) reported a similar blue wing deviation and peak shift in the _ absorbed _ silicate profile in ngc1068 .",
    "this indicates that the observed shift of silicate emission may not be purely a temperature effect .",
    "we conclude that , due to dust processing , the dust giving rise to the emission features in these agn may deviate from pristine galactic ism dust .",
    "evidence that dust in the circum - nuclear region of agn has different properties ( like larger grain size ) than in the galactic diffuse ism has been reported earlier ( maiolino et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "our conclusion does not depend on the simplified assumption of a single temperature that we made in the fit described above ( ism dust opacities x planck function ) .",
    "we have repeated the fit using a mixture of various planck functions with cooler and warmer temperatures . applying a mixture of temperatures rather than a single temperature worsens the fit :",
    "the silicon features are broadened even more , such that the mismatch in the blue wing of the 10@xmath1 m feature and the red wing of the 18@xmath1 m feature increases .",
    "the presence of the 10@xmath1 m silicate emission feature over a broad range of agn luminosities could be taken as evidence for the obscuring torus . however , it is not clear yet whether the silicate emission arises in fact from a face - on torus of the standard unified agn scenario .",
    "apparently , some agn have a significant region of optically thin , relatively cool ( @xmath0200k ) dust emission with comparable properties in various agn types .",
    "this temperature , though , seems too cold to be explained by a hot inner torus wall , which should emit closer to the sublimation temperature of silicates .",
    "depending on the size and composition of the grains , this is between @xmath6800 and 1500k ( kimura et al .",
    "a lower temperature might be the result of a stratification into the torus wall , with cooler dust from deeper layers contributing to the inferred average value .",
    "however , as described above , mixing emission components of different temperature makes the fit to the observed feature profiles worse .",
    "this preliminary approach needs to be improved by real ( 3-dimensional ) radiative transfer models of the agn emission , before final conclusions can be reached .",
    "the case of ngc3998 with its low agn luminosity and different sed shape at longer wavelengths compared to qsos places important new constraints on such modeling .",
    "more indication that the silicate emission may not originate in a ( standard ) torus is provided by the fact that other type  1 agn ( e.g. some quest qsos and some qsos of the hao et al . sample ) do _ not _ show silicates in emission .",
    "furthermore , obscuring tori may not be present in liners at all , given that variable central uv point sources are observed in both type  1 and type  2 liners ( maoz et al .",
    "in addition , observations of nearby seyfert galaxies have revealed extended dust emission that is roughly co - spatial with the nlr ( e.g.  cameron  1993 ; bock et al .",
    "1998 ; tomono et al .",
    "2001 ; radomski et al .  2003 ; packham et al .",
    "the role and influence of this extended component is currently poorly constrained but may be significant , given the absence of a strong type  1 vs. type  2 anisotropy in total agn infrared continua ( lutz et al .",
    "we note that dust temperatures of the order 200k are fully consistent with observed color temperatures of extended nlr dust ( radomski et al .",
    "2003 , packham et al .",
    "future results from spitzer observations of both type  1 and type  2 agn over the entire range of intrinsic luminosity will certainly shed more light on this issue .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through contracts # 1263752 and # 1267948 issued by jpl / caltech ( sv , dsr , dck ) . as thanks the israel science foundation for support .",
