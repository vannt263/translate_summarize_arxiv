    "black holes ( bhs ) in einstein - maxwell theory are characterized by three parameters @xcite : mass @xmath2 , electric charge @xmath3 and angular momentum @xmath4 .",
    "bhs are thought to be abundant objects in the universe .",
    "their mass is estimated to vary between @xmath5 and @xmath6 or higher @xcite , their electrical charge is negligible because of the effect of surrounding plasma @xcite and their angular momentum is expected to be close to the extremal limit because of accretion and merger events @xcite .",
    "a non - comprehensive list of some astrophysical bh candidates @xcite is shown in table [ tab : data ] .    despite the wealth of circumstantial evidence",
    ", there is no definite observational proof of the existence of astrophysical bhs due to the difficulty to detect an event horizon in astrophysical bh candidates @xcite .",
    "thus astrophysical objects without event horizon , yet observationally indistinguishable from bhs , can not be excluded a priori .",
    "some of the most viable alternative models describing an ultra - compact astrophysical object include gravastars , boson stars , wormholes and superspinars .",
    "+ dark energy stars or _ gravastars _ are compact objects with de sitter interior and schwarzschild exterior @xcite .",
    "these two regions are glued together by a model - dependent intermediate region . in the original model",
    "@xcite the intermediate region is an ultra - stiff thin shell .",
    "models without shells or discontinuities have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "+ _ boson stars _ are macroscopic quantum states which are prevented from undergoing complete gravitational collapse by heisenberg uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "their models differ in the scalar self - interaction potential which also set the allowed maximum compactness for a boson star .",
    "+ an exhaustive description of _ wormholes _ can be found in the monograph @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this work",
    "we shall consider particular wormholes which are infinitesimal variations of bh spacetimes .",
    "these wormholes may be indistinguishable from ordinary bhs @xcite .",
    "+ _ superspinars _ are solutions of the gravitational field equations that violate the kerr bound . these geometries could be created by high energy corrections to einstein gravity such as those present in string - inspired models @xcite .",
    ".mass , @xmath2 , radius , @xmath7 , angular momentum , @xmath8 , and compactness , @xmath9 , for some bh candidates ( from @xcite ) .",
    "mass and radius are in solar units . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      objects with @xmath10 could potentially describe superspinars .",
    "several arguments suggest that objects rotating above the kerr bound are unstable .",
    "firstly , extremal kerr bhs are marginally stable .",
    "thus the addition of extra rotation should lead to instability .",
    "secondly , fast - spinning objects usually take a pancake - like form @xcite and are subject to the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite .",
    "finally , kerr - like geometries , like naked singularities , seem to be unstable against a certain class of gravitational perturbations @xcite called algebraically special perturbations @xcite . for objects with",
    "@xmath10 the surface or mirror can be placed anywhere outside @xmath11 . in general",
    "the instability is as strong as in the @xmath12 regime .",
    "an example in shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : super ] for the surface at @xmath13 .",
    "this result confirms other investigations suggesting that ultra - compact objects rotating above the kerr bound are unstable @xcite .",
    "we investigated the ergoregion instability of some ultra - compact , horizonless objects which can mimick the spacetime of a rotating black hole .",
    "we studied some of the most viable bh mimickers : gravastars , boson stars , wormhole and superspinars .",
    "if rotating , boson stars and gravastars may develop ergoregion instabilities .",
    "analytical and numerical results indicate that these objects are unstable against scalar field perturbations for a large range of the parameters .",
    "slowly rotating gravastars can develop an ergoregion depending on their angular momentum , their compactness and the thickness of their intermediate region .",
    "in a recent work @xcite it has pointed out that slowly rotating gravastars may not develop an ergoregion . in the formation of the ergoregion for rotating gravastars an important role",
    "is played by the thickness ( see figure [ fig : delta ] ) which is not easily detectable .",
    "thus further investigations are needed to better understand the ergoregion formation in physical resonable gravastar models .",
    "the instability timescale for both boson stars and gravastars can be many orders of magnitude stronger than the instability timescale for ordinary stars with uniform density . in the large @xmath14 approximation , suitable for a wkb treatment , gravitational and scalar perturbations have similar instability timescales . in the low-@xmath15 regime",
    "gravitational perturbations are expected to have even shorter instability timescales than scalar perturbations .",
    "instability timescales can be as low as @xmath16 seconds for a @xmath17 objects and about a week for supermassive bhs , @xmath18 , monotonically decreasing for larger rotations and a larger compactness .",
    "the essential features of wormholes and superspinars have been captured by a simple model whose physical properties are largely independent from the dynamical details of the gravitational system .",
    "numerical and analytic results show that the ergoregion instability of these objects is extremely strong for any value of their angular momentum , with timescales of order @xmath19 seconds for a @xmath20 object and @xmath21 seconds for a @xmath18 object .",
    "therefore , high rotation is an indirect evidence for horizons .",
    "although further studies are needed , the above investigation suggests that exotic objects without event horizon are likely to be ruled out as viable candidates for astrophysical ultra - compact objects .",
    "this strengthens the role of bhs as candidates for astrophysical observations of rapidly spinning compact objects .",
    "the authors warmly thank matteo losito for interesting discussions and for sharing some of his results .",
