    "characteristic identities have proven to be a useful tool for revealing important and explicit information about representations of lie algebras and superalgebras .",
    "the aim of this article is to give an overview of how characteristic identities may be used for such purposes .",
    "it was dirac in 1936 @xcite who first employed polynomial identities related to @xmath0 in the context of relativistically invariant wave equations .",
    "later , lehrer - ilamed @xcite noted more generally that @xmath1 elements of the enveloping algebra @xmath2 of a lie algebra @xmath3 satisfy @xmath1 identities , which in some cases may be expressed as a single polynomial identity of degree @xmath4 for an @xmath5 matrix with entries from @xmath2 .",
    "there were subsequent works , for example , by louck @xcite , mukunda @xcite and louck and galbraith @xcite in which polynomial identities were encountered for a variety of lie algebras . in @xcite , bracken and green established a general theory of characteristic identities for classical lie algebras , which was soon followed by the work of obrien , ca nt and carey @xcite in which the authors instituted a suitable algebraic formalism . in a series of papers @xcite , gould made use of the characteristic identities to deduce information such as invariants , wigner coefficients and matrix elements pertaining to the irreducible representations of the classical lie algebras .",
    "it is also worth noting that these polynomial identities also extend to finite groups @xcite and quantum groups @xcite .    following the work of kac @xcite , jarvis and green @xcite investigated characteristic identities and invariants related to the vector representation of the general linear , special linear and orthosymplectic lie superalgebras .",
    "other works soon followed that were related to other lie superalgebras ( e.g. @xcite ) and more general representations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it was not until the more recent work of the current authors @xcite , however , in which the approach of gould for lie algebras was generalised to the case of lie superalgebras , particularly for the general linear case .",
    "to demonstrate how the characteristic identities may be utilised , we exhibit the theory in the context of the lie algebra @xmath6 .",
    "we denote the generators of @xmath6 by @xmath7 , @xmath8 which satisfy the defining relations @xmath9",
    "= \\delta_{kj}a_{i\\ell } - \\delta_{i\\ell}a_{kj}.\\ ] ] we may assemble the generators into a square @xmath5 matrix @xmath10 with @xmath11 entry @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath12 and define powers of @xmath10 recursively by @xmath13      casimir invariants are defined as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xmath19tr@xmath20 to assist the reader in understanding the notation used throughout , consider the following straightforward examples that were originally presented in @xcite . for @xmath21 , ( trivial ) direct calculation yields @xmath22 which is interpreted to mean @xmath23 for each @xmath24 . for @xmath15 , we may similarly calculate @xmath25 this gives two examples of polynomial identities satisfied by the matrix @xmath10 with coefficients in the centre of the enveloping algebra of @xmath21 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that in these cases @xmath26 , @xmath27 for @xmath21 and @xmath28 for @xmath15 , demonstrating that the casimir invariants so defined are not generally independent .",
    "the characteristic identity of @xmath10 for @xmath6 on a finite dimensional irreducible representation @xmath29 is constructed in the following way .    in the previous section",
    "we saw examples of how the matrix @xmath10 satisfies polynomial identities with coefficients expressible in terms of the casimir invariants .",
    "if we now look at such polynomial identities on a finite dimensional irreducible representation @xmath29 , with highest weight highest weight @xmath30 , we then have from schur s lemma that the casimir invariants take on constant values on @xmath29 .",
    "for example , for @xmath6 , @xmath31 bracken and green @xcite showed that the identity @xmath32 holds on a finite dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath6 , where @xmath33 are referred to as the characteristic roots .",
    "we highlight the fact that the entries of @xmath10 are now representation matrices .",
    "the matrix @xmath10 is not the only such matrix one may define .",
    "consider taking the negative transpose of @xmath10 as @xmath34 one may also show that @xmath35 holds on a finite dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath6 , where the characteristic roots are in this case given by @xmath36 .",
    "the construction of these characteristic matrices at this stage may seem ad hoc , but there is in fact a general formalism which relies on the quadratic casimir element @xcite .",
    "such a matrix can then be constructed for an arbitrary semisimple lie algebra .",
    "let @xmath37 be the co - product of the enveloping algebra @xmath2 of a semisimple lie algebra @xmath3 , and let @xmath38 denote any irreducible representation of @xmath3 corresponding to module @xmath39 .",
    "we may define the matrix with algebraic entries @xmath40.\\ ] ] considering its action on an arbitrary finite dimensional irreducible representation @xmath41 gives @xmath42.\\ ] ] in the case @xmath39 is the vector representation of @xmath43 ( i.e. highest weight @xmath44 ) we obtain @xmath45 , and for the case we take the dual vector representation of @xmath43 , we obtain @xmath10 .",
    "for the characteristic roots @xmath46 in the general case , first consider the clebsch - gordan decomposition @xmath47 on each @xmath48 , @xmath49end@xmath50 takes on the constant value @xmath51,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 denotes the eigenvalue of @xmath53 on @xmath48 , @xmath54 is the eigenvalue of @xmath53 on @xmath29 , and @xmath55 the eigenvalue of @xmath53 on @xmath39 .",
    "this results in the characteristic identity @xmath56      we may use the characteristic identities to define projection operators , which , as we shall see , turn out to be a crucial ingredient for determining matrix elements .    we modify our notation slightly , so that @xmath57 is understood to be the characteristic matrix associated with @xmath6 .",
    "explicitly , we have from the characteristic identity @xmath58 and @xmath59    if we set @xmath60 to be the vector representation of @xmath6 , we have the decomposition @xmath61 and so @xmath62 is a projection . here , @xmath63 is simply an @xmath4-tuple with a 1 in the @xmath64th entry and zeroes elsewhere .    by contrast , denoting by @xmath65 the dual vector representation of @xmath6 , we have the decomposition @xmath66 which implies that @xmath67 is a projection",
    ". these projections will be used in what follows .",
    "we may utilise the characteristic identity to determine the matrix elements of finite dimensional irreducible representations . here",
    "we demonstrate the procedure , at the same time highlighting the power of this approach .",
    "of particular note is the fact that we may deduce , up to a phase factor , not only the matrix elements of the elementary generators of @xmath6 , i.e. those of the form @xmath68 , but also the nonelementary generators .      before presenting the details of the matrix element formulae ,",
    "we first need to describe vector operators .",
    "define a @xmath6 vector operator as a collection of @xmath4 operators @xmath69 satisfying @xmath70 = \\delta_{jk}\\psi_i.\\ ] ] related to the dual vector representation , we also define a @xmath6 contragredient vector operator as a collection of @xmath4 operators @xmath71 satisfying @xmath72 = -\\delta_{ik}\\phi_j.\\ ] ] from the work of green @xcite , we have @xmath73 where @xmath74 are linearly independent and change that value of the highest weight label @xmath75 by one , leaving the other @xmath76 unchanged , i.e. @xmath77 also , in the case of the contragredient vector operator , we have @xmath78 such that @xmath79 where @xmath80      the @xmath81 branching rules give the decomposition of a @xmath82 irreducible representation into a direct sum of @xmath6 irreducible representations : @xmath83 where the direct sum is taken over an admissible set of dominant @xmath6 weights @xmath84 .",
    "this determines the branching rules . specifically , the highest weights @xmath85 are known to satisfy @xmath86 by recursion we may deduce the gelfand - tsetlin @xcite patterns for the entire subalgebra chain @xmath87 which is in one - to - one correspondence with an orthonormal basis of @xmath88 .",
    "now consider the @xmath82 characteristic matrix : @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 are @xmath6 vector and contragredient vector operators respectively .",
    "the matrix @xmath92 satisfies @xmath93 and the projections are given explicitly by @xmath94      following the work of gould @xcite , we are now in a position to construct eigenvalues of invariants @xmath95 ( defined below ) . consider the @xmath82 identity expressed in the form @xmath96 looking at the @xmath97 entry , @xmath98 gives @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a @xmath6 invariant .",
    "after some manipulation , we arrive at @xmath101    it is known @xcite that for any polynomial @xmath102 , @xmath103 since the @xmath104 are linearly independent .",
    "also , @xmath105 since the @xmath95 are defined in terms of projections .",
    "this gives a set of linear equations that can be solved for @xmath95 , giving @xmath106 similarly , for @xmath107 we have @xmath108      in @xcite , gould showed that @xmath109 where @xmath110 taking the @xmath111 entry of equation ( [ equ1 ] ) above leads to the following expression for the action of the elementary generators @xmath112 : @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes a state corresponding to a gelfand pattern , @xmath115 denotes a shift in the @xmath116th highest weight label at the @xmath4th level , and @xmath117 similar expressions may be obtained for @xmath118 .    using similar techniques",
    ", we may also determine matrix element formulae for @xmath119 : @xmath120 where @xmath121^{-1/2}. \\label{mels}\\ ] ] similarly for @xmath122 .",
    "for the lie superalgebra @xmath123 , we now have generators @xmath124 , @xmath125 satisfying @xmath126 \\equiv a_{pq}a_{rs } - ( -1)^{[(p)+(q)][(r)+(s)]}a_{rs}a_{pq } = \\delta_{qr}a_{ps } - ( -1)^{[(p)+(q)][(r)+(s)]}\\delta_{ps}a_{rq}.\\ ] ] where @xmath127 analogous to the lie algebra case , we define the characteristic matrices by setting @xmath128 on the irreducible representation @xmath129 , with @xmath130 , it is also possible to show @xcite that the following characteristic identities hold @xmath131 with associated characteristic roots @xmath132 by analogy with the methods outlined for @xmath6 , we may construct similar objects for @xmath123 as listed below .    * projection operators @xmath133 ; * vector operators @xmath134 ; * branching rules ; * invariants ( @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) ; * matrix elements .",
    "there is , however , one major complication in the context of lie superalgebras .",
    "the representation theory is not as well - understood as that of lie algebras , and in particular the branching rules for an arbitrary irreducible representation are not known .",
    "in fact , in general it is not even known if an irreducible representation is completely reducible , i.e. there is no analogue of weyl s theorem in general . to avoid this problem , we look at a special subset of the irreducible representations first considered by scheunert , nahm and rittenberg @xcite .",
    "the so - called star representations were first considered by scheunert , nahm and rittenberg @xcite in order to ensure complete reducibility .",
    "let @xmath139 be a well - defined , positive - definite , invariant , sesquilinear form defined on an irreducible highest weight module @xmath129 of @xmath123 : @xmath140}{\\langlev|a_{qp}w\\rangle } , \\ \\ \\",
    "\\epsilon = 0,1.\\ ] ]    for the case @xmath141 , @xmath129 is said to be a type 1 star irrep .",
    "otherwise , for @xmath142 , @xmath129 is called a type 2 star irrep .",
    "we have complete reducibility in these cases , and so determine branching rules , which is the one complication in the above procedure .",
    "the star representations , which we now refer to as `` unitary '' due to the existence of the positive - definite form ( i.e. an inner product ) , were classified by gould and zhang @xcite .",
    "here we only focus on the type 1 case .    in particular , @xmath129 , with highest weight @xmath143",
    "is a type 1 star irrep .",
    "iff    * @xmath144 ( typical ) , or * there exists an odd index @xmath145 such that @xmath146 ( atypical ) .",
    "there are similar conditions for type 2 star irreps which may be found in @xcite , but we will not include the details here .    as indicated in the paper @xcite , we set @xmath147 then a type 1 star irrep .",
    "@xmath129 of @xmath123 has highest weight expressible in the form @xmath148 where @xmath149 corresponds to a covariant tensor representation , i.e. it occurs within a finite tensor product of the vector module @xmath150 with itself , @xmath151 or @xmath152 and @xmath153      the main outcome of our research so far is that for type 1 star irreps .",
    ", generators of @xmath154 have action of the form @xmath155{\\left|\\lambda_{q , s } + \\delta_{u_p , p } + \\cdots + \\delta_{u_\\ell,\\ell}\\right\\rangle } , \\ \\",
    "\\ell < p+1,\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath156 .",
    "the precise form of the coefficients @xmath157 $ ] ( i.e. matrix elements ) will not be given here , but are similar in form to the matrix elements of equation ( [ mels ] ) above which are related to the lie algebra @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , for the cases under consideration , we make the point that the procedure closely follows that already presented for @xmath6 .",
    "for the fully explicit details of matrix element formulae and other features such as branching rules related to the type 1 unitary irreps of @xmath123 , see @xcite .",
    "based on the convenient form of the highest weight given by equation ( [ hwform ] ) , we see that our results agree with those presented in the work of stoilova and van der jeugt @xcite , molev @xcite and also the essentially typical representations considered by palev @xcite .",
    "currently work is in preparation for providing the explicit details of the type 2 unitary irreps .",
    "it is also of interest to consider how to treat the cases of representations that do not admit an invariant inner product , and hence are not guaranteed to be completely reducible .",
    "one possibility is to investigate mixed tensor representations .",
    "that is , those representations that occur within the tensor product of a type 1 unitary irrep . with a type 2 unitary irrep .",
    "having made some progress for the classical lie superalgebras , it is also of interest to determine the analogous matrix element formulae for the quantum group counterparts .",
    "finally , our procedure may be considered beyond the vector representation ( a type 1 unitary irrep . ) and the dual vector representation ( a type 2 unitary irrep . ) , leading to a more general pattern calculus .",
