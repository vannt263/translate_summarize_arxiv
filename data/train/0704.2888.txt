    "an isotropic , apparently diffuse flux of @xmath0 rays was discovered with sas-2 in the @xmath1  200 mev range @xcite .",
    "egret , improving and extending the sas-2 result , measured isotropic @xmath0-ray emission in the @xmath2 mev  100 gev range @xcite with @xmath3 intensity at 1 gev at the level of @xmath4 kev/(@xmath5-s - sr ) , and with @xmath3 spectral index @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "the diffuse isotropic @xmath0-ray background consists of an extragalactic @xmath0-ray background and an uncertain contribution of quasi - isotropic galactic @xmath0 rays produced , for example , by compton - scattered radiations from cosmic - ray electrons .",
    "the model - dependent galactic contribution @xcite , and the addition at some level of heliospheric flux @xcite , means that the actual contribution from extragalactic sources is somewhat uncertain . the data in fig .",
    "1a compares the extragalactic diffuse @xmath0-ray intensity from egret analysis @xcite with results using the galprop model @xcite , the latter of which requires an extended ( @xmath7  10 kpc ) nonthermal electron halo to fit the hard ( @xmath8 ) diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission . for our purposes , we consider the apparently diffuse extragalactic @xmath0-ray background ( egrb ) of @xcite as the conservative upper limit for the superposed intensity of any class of @xmath0-ray sources , with the @xcite intensity as an absolute upper limit to the combined residual intensity from all source classes .",
    "the galprop fits @xcite to the osse - comptel - egret milky way intensity spectra in different directions toward the galaxy implies the total @xmath0-ray luminosity of the milky way galaxy .",
    "scaled to @xmath9 ergs s@xmath10 , the galprop analysis gives @xmath11 for the @xmath12 mev @xmath0-ray luminosity of the milky way , a factor @xmath13 greater than the value @xmath14 inferred from cos - b observations @xcite .",
    "most of this emission is from secondaries created in cosmic - ray nuclear production processes .",
    "the galactic @xmath0-ray power provides an important yardstick to assess the total contribution of to the unresolved @xmath0-ray background of cosmic - ray emissions from star - forming galaxies , as described in more detail below .",
    "every @xmath0-ray source class makes a different contribution to the @xmath0-ray background , including transient events below detector threshold , variously oriented relativistic jet sources , and large numbers of individually weak sources . the basic formalism for making such calculations for beamed and unbeamed sources",
    "was given in my barcelona talk @xcite . here",
    "i review the various source classes that likely dominate the composition of the diffuse background : blazars and radio/@xmath0 galaxies ; star - forming galaxies of various types ; @xmath0 rays from structure - formation shocks ; and grbs .",
    "population studies of @xmath0-ray blazars were undertaken soon after the recognition of the @xmath0-ray blazar class with egret @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a @xmath15 analysis assuming no density evolution and showed that luminosity evolution of egret blazars was implied by the data . with a larger data set , and using radio data to ensure the sample was unbiased in regard to redshift determination , @xcite again found that luminosity evolution was required .",
    "they obtained best - fit values through the maximum likelihood method that gave an agn contribution to the egret @xmath0-ray background at the level of @xmath16% .",
    "-ray background from analyses of egret data , shown by filled @xcite and open @xcite data points , compared to model calculations of the contributions to the egrb for fsrqs and bl lac objects , and total agns @xcite , star - forming galaxies @xcite , starburst galaxies @xcite , structure shocks in clusters of galaxies @xcite , and grbs @xcite .",
    "( b ) fitted egret and predicted redshift distributions of fsrqs and bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "( c ) fitted egret size distribution , and predictions for different flux levels @xcite.,width=614 ]    @xcite postulated a radio/@xmath0-ray correlation in blazars , and tried to correct for the duty cycle and @xmath0-ray spectral hardening of flaring states .",
    "they found that essentially 100% of the egret @xmath0-ray background arises from unresolved blazars and agns .",
    "in later work @xcite , they predict that glast will detect @xmath17 blazars to a flux level of @xmath18 ph(@xmath12 mev)/(@xmath19-s ) , which will be reached with glast after @xmath7 years .",
    "they did not , however , fit the blazar redshift distribution to provide a check on their model , nor distinguish between flat spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) and bl lac objects .",
    "the crucial underlying assumption of this approach , which has been developed in recent work @xcite , is that there is a simple relation between the radio and @xmath0-ray fluxes of blazars . because a large number of egret @xmath0-ray blazars ( primarily fsrqs ) are found in the 5 ghz , @xmath20 jy @xcite catalog , a radio@xmath21-ray correlation is expected .",
    "this correlation is not , however , evident in 2.7 and 5 ghz monitoring of egret @xmath0-ray blazars @xcite .",
    "x - ray selected bl objects are also not well - sampled in ghz radio surveys .",
    "studies based on correlations between the radio and @xmath0-ray emissions from blazars must therefore consider the very different properties and histories of fsrqs and bls and their separate contributions to the @xmath0-ray background .",
    "treatments of blazar statistics that avoid any radio/@xmath0-ray correlation and separately consider fsrqs and bl lac objects have been developed by @xcite and @xcite . in the @xcite study ,",
    "blazar spectra were calculated assuming an injection electron number index of @xmath22 .",
    "distributions in injected particle energy in bl lac and fsrq jets were separately considered , with a simple description of density evolution given in the form of a cutoff at some maximum redshift @xmath23 .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath23 , @xcite concluded that as much as @xmath1 ",
    "80% of the egrb is produced by unresolved agns , with @xmath24 ",
    "90% of the emission from fr 1 galaxies and bl lac objects .    in my recent study @xcite",
    ", i also use a physical model to fit the egret data on the redshift and size distribution of egret blazars .",
    "the egret blazar sample consists of 46 fsrqs and 14 bl lac objects that were detected in the phase 1 egret all - sky survey @xcite , with fluxes as reported in the third egret catalog @xcite .",
    "a blazar is approximated by a relativistic spherical ball entraining a tangled magnetic field and containing an isotropic , power - law distribution of nonthermal electrons .",
    "single electron power - law distributions were used in the study , with indices @xmath25 for fsrqs and @xmath26 for bl lac objects , giving spectral indices @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , as shown by observations @xcite . beaming patterns appropriate to external compton and synchrotron self - compton processes , and bulk lorentz factor @xmath29 and @xmath30 , were used in fsrqs and bl lac objects , respectively .",
    "the comoving directional luminosities @xmath31 and blazar comoving rate densities ( blazar formation rate ; bfrs ) for the two classes were adjusted to give agreement with the data .",
    "the threshold detector sensitivity @xmath32 , in units of @xmath33 ph@xmath34 mev)/(@xmath19-s ) , was nominally taken to be @xmath35 for the two - week on - axis egret sensitivity , and @xmath36 for the one - year all - sky sensitivity of glast . due to incompleteness of the sample near threshold ,",
    "the egret threshold was adjusted to @xmath37 . because a mono - luminosity function was used , the range in apparent powers is entirely kinematic in this model , arising from the different , randomly oriented jet directions .    by using a minimalist blazar model ,",
    "the model parameters were severely constrained .",
    "the fsrq data were fit with @xmath38 ergs/(s - sr ) and a bfr that was @xmath39 greater at @xmath40  3 than at present . the bl lac data , by contrast , could not be fit using a fixed luminosity . a model that could jointly fit the redshift and size distribution of bl lac objects",
    "required that bl lac objects be brighter and less numerous that in the past , consistent with a picture where fsrqs evolve into bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "1b shows the fitted egret redshift distributions and predicted redshift distributions of @xmath0 galaxies and blazars at different glast sensitivities @xcite .",
    "the fits to the egret size distributions of fsrqs and bl lac objects , and extrapolations of the model size distributions to lower flux thresholds , are shown in fig.1c .",
    "after one year of observations with glast ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 fsrqs / fr2 and @xmath43 bl lac / fr1 @xmath0 galaxies and @xmath0-ray blazars are predicted .",
    "this is a lower prediction , and additional hard - spectrum blazars to which egret was not sensitive could increase this number , but not by more than a factor @xmath44 .",
    "the contribution of unresolved blazars below a flux level of @xmath45  25 to the egrb is shown in fig .",
    "as can be seen , the total blazar/@xmath0 galaxy contribution is less than @xmath46  30% of the egret egrb intensity , meaning that other classes of sources must make a significant contribution .",
    "the integrated emission from @xmath0 rays formed by cosmic - ray interactions in star - forming galaxies will make a `` guaranteed '' @xmath0-ray background .",
    "pavlidou & fields @xcite calculate this intensity by approximating the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray spectrum as a broken power law and assuming that the @xmath0-ray spectrum of a star - forming galaxy is proportional to the supernova rate and thus the massive star - formation rate , which can be inferred from the measured blue and uv luminosity density .",
    "1a shows their results for a dust - corrected star formation rate ( sfr ) integrated over all redshifts , and a lower curve where the sfr is integrated to redshift unity .",
    "a different approach @xcite to this problem starts by noting that cosmic - ray protons in the milky way lose only @xmath47% of their energy before escaping .",
    "this fraction could rise to nearly 100% in starburst galaxies where the target gas density is much higher and the timescale for escape , due primarily to advective galactic winds rather than diffusion in the galaxy s magnetic field , is less than the nuclear loss time .",
    "support for this contention is provided by the observed correlation between far infrared flux  primarily due to starlight reradiated by dust and gas  with synchrotron flux produced by cosmic ray electrons .",
    "if both are proportional to the supernova rate , and the radio - emitting electrons lose a large fraction of their energy due to synchrotron cooling , then this correlation is explained @xcite .",
    "the calculated intensity @xcite from starburst galaxies is shown in fig .",
    "the bulk of this intensity is formed at redshifts @xmath48 , where the starburst fraction of star - forming galaxies is large . the starburst intensity from ref .",
    "@xcite is smaller than the the total star - forming galaxy contribution @xcite , even when the latter calculation is truncated at @xmath49 .",
    "the latter calculation was checked in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the @xmath0-ray spectrum of the milky way .",
    "stecker @xcite argues that the starburst contribution is a factor @xmath50 lower than diffuse @xmath0-ray and neutrino intensity derived by loeb and waxman @xcite and thompson et al .",
    "@xcite by pointing out that directly accelerated electrons make a strong contribution to the synchrotron flux , and questioning the assumption that protons lose all their energy in starbursts .",
    "this criticism is addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "glast will clarify this situation through its observations of nearby star - forming galaxies , e.g. , lmc , smc , m31 , and m33 , the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 , and infrared luminous galaxies like arp 220 .",
    "these galaxies are predicted to be glast sources @xcite , and will provide benchmarks to correlate @xmath0-ray fluxes with star formation activity .",
    "nonthermal radiation from clusters of galaxies is expected for several reasons : cosmic rays will be accelerated through merger shocks from merging subclusters , from accretion shocks as primordial matter continues to accrete on a forming cluster , and from turbulent reacceleration of nonthermal particles by plasma waves in the intracluster medium . in addition , a galaxy cluster often has an energetic agn in its central cd galaxy that could inject cosmic rays into the cluster medium .",
    "hadronic cosmic rays with energies @xmath51 ev will be trapped on timescales longer than the hubble time , so galaxy clusters become storage volumes for cosmic rays @xcite . in spite of these expectations ,",
    "egret did not make a high - significance detection of any galaxy cluster @xcite .    hard x - ray tails have also not been detected with high significance from the coma cluster or any other galaxy cluster .",
    "the study of nonthermal emission from clusters of galaxies has consequently stalled , as nonthermal x - ray measurements provide the crucial information to normalize the magnetic field and nonthermal electron spectrum .",
    "predictions based on the marginal detection of the hard x - ray tail from the coma cluster indicate that coma will be easily detectable with glast in one year of observation and marginally detectable with ground - based @xmath0-ray telescopes in a nominal 50 hour observation @xcite , though the angular extent of coma makes such detections more difficult @xcite .    in view of these uncertainties ,",
    "any calculation of the integrated contribution from clusters of galaxies to the @xmath0-ray background is likewise highly uncertain .",
    "1a shows predictions @xcite for galaxy cluster emission .",
    "glast detections of clusters of galaxies will be crucial to provide a better basis for determining this contribution .",
    "the contribution of untriggered grbs to the @xmath0-ray background can be estimated in a number of ways , but all depend on modeling , or inferring from observations , the typical high - energy grb spectra . for the optimistic case that the tev flux made by a grb is @xmath52 greater than the mev flux ,",
    "then the superpositions of grb emissions are found to make @xmath53% of the @xmath0-ray background after cascading from high energies into the gev band @xcite .",
    "if one instead relies on observations of egret spark - chamber grbs that show that the fluence in the egret band is only @xmath53% of the fluence in the batse band , then grbs are found to give very little ( @xmath54% ) contribution to the @xmath0-ray background @xcite .",
    "this neglects the contributions of short , hard grbs and low luminosity grbs , but since these have small fluences and all - sky rates , they are unlikely to make a significant contribution to the @xmath0-ray background .",
    "it hardly needs to be mentioned that glast observations of the high - energy emission from grbs will provide crucial information to determine the share of the background @xmath0-ray intensity provided by grbs .",
    "a truly diffuse flux of @xmath0 rays will be formed by the cascade radiations initiated by photopion and photopair production of ultra - high energy cosmic rays interacting with photons of the extragalactic background light .",
    "because the electromagnetic secondaries are distributed over several orders or magnitude as they cascade to photon energies where the universe becomes transparent to @xmath55 processes , this intensity will be well below the waxman - bahcall intensity at @xmath56 kev/(@xmath19-s - sr ) . by comparing with the diffuse neutrino intensities calculated in bottom - up scenarios for the ultra - high energy cosmic rays @xcite ,",
    "cosmogenic @xmath0 rays are not expected to make a large contribution to the egrb ( however , see ref .",
    "@xcite , though they could for top - down models @xcite .",
    "this question will definitively be answered by auger data .",
    "the various source classes that contribute to the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background have hardly been exhausted , but the described classes are expected to be most important . yet when one adds up the best guesses of the various contributions to the total , as shown in fig .  1a",
    ", a deficit remains at both low ( @xmath57 mev ) and high ( @xmath58 gev ) energies .",
    "because star - forming and starburst galaxies make such a large contribution to the total , it is possible that their spectra are actually much softer than assumed on the low - energy side , due to nonthermal electron bremsstrahlung and compton - scattered emissions from @xmath0-ray production by cosmic rays in  thick - target starburst and infrared luminous galaxies ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "this , or soft - spectrum radio galaxies and from the superposition of hard tailes from many weak radio - quiet seyfert galaxies , could explain the low - energy deficit .",
    "it seems unlikely , however , that star - forming galaxies , whose high - energy radiation originates from cosmic rays accelerated by supernova remnant shocks , could explain the deficit on the high - energy side unless shock injection spectra harder than @xmath22 were postulated .",
    "the egret effective area dropped rapidly above @xmath50 gev due to self - vetoing effects , so it was not sensitive to hard - spectrum sources , in particular , hard spectrum bl lac objects . but",
    "the bl lac contribution is estimated at the 5% level , and it is difficult to suppose that egret was not able to detect a number of such hard - spectrum bl lac objects .",
    "hard tails on fsrqs originating , e.g. , from photohadronic cascade emissions @xcite , could explain the high - energy discrepancy .",
    "other possibilities are the diffuse contributions from dark matter annihilation @xcite , or cascade radiations from misaligned blazars @xcite .",
    "we must furthermore keep in mind the possibility that the model of foreground galactic emission that must be subtracted from the extragalactic flux is incomplete @xcite , or that the egret internal background was underestimated @xcite .",
    "data from glast will tell us which , if any , of these suggestions are correct , and whether new , unexpected sources of high - energy @xmath0 rays are required to explain the @xmath0-ray background .                                                                                      strong , a.  w. , moskalenko , i.  v. , & reimer , o.  2000 , _ astrophysical j.  _ 537 , 763 strong , a.  w. , moskalenko , i.  v. , & reimer , o.  2004 , _ astrophysical j.",
