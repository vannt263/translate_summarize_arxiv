    "the random - field ising model ( rfim ) at zero temperature is a prototype of many disordered systems which exhibit hysteretic and jerky behavior when an external parameter ( _ e.g. _ magnetic field , pressure , strain ) is slowly changed@xcite .",
    "this behavior is related to the existence of a corrugated ( free ) energy landscape with many local minima ( or metastable states ) separated by barriers much larger than @xmath0 , therefore preventing relaxation towards equilibrium on experimental time scales . as a consequence ,",
    "the response to an external driving field is a series of discontinuous jumps ( called avalanches ) from one metastable state to another , the number and size of these jumps varying with the amount of disorder . in the 3-dimensional rfim with gaussian random fields two regimes of avalanches",
    "are observed@xcite : at large disorder , there are many microscopic jumps resulting in a smooth magnetization curve macroscopically ; at low disorder , there is a system - spanning avalanche resulting in a macroscopic jump in the magnetization curve .",
    "these two regimes are separated by a critical point at which avalanches of all sizes are observed . as shown recently",
    ", this type of nonequilibrium disorder - induced phase transition may underly the hysteretic behavior of @xmath1he adsorbed in high porosity silica aerogels@xcite .    even though the @xmath2 rfim and similar models have been extensively studied",
    ", there is currently no analytical tool to compute the saturation hysteresis loop in finite dimensions ( even approximately ) and no theory to describe the statistical properties of the metastable states , for instance their configurational entropy ( also called ` complexity ' ) as a function of magnetization .",
    "furthermore , the behavior of the correlation functions along the hysteresis loop is unknown , although this is an issue of experimental interest@xcite . of course",
    ", describing analytically such a nonequilibrium situation where the present state of the system depends on its past history is a difficult problem and at first sight there seems to be no other choice than to follow the dynamical evolution for given initial conditions ( _ e.g. _ one of the two saturated states corresponding to infinitely positive or negative magnetic field ) . in this way",
    ", one can treat exactly ` mean - field ' systems , _",
    "i.e. _ fully connected lattices@xcite or lattices with a locally tree - like structure such as the bethe lattice@xcite , and obtain analytical expressions for the saturation hysteresis loop or the avalanche size distribution . to go further and build a field - theoretical description of these phenomena",
    "it then seems necessary to employ the martin - siggia - rose formalism@xcite . in ferromagnetic systems , however , an alternative route is possible thanks to a remarkable property of the saturation hysteresis loop in the large - disorder regime : the loop is the convex hull of the metastable states in the two - dimensional field - magnetization plane@xcite . in other words ,",
    "the complexity is zero outside the loop and positive inside@xcite .",
    "moreover , it exactly vanishes along the loop since there is a single ` extremal ' metastable state at a given field ( at least for a continuous distribution of the random field ) .",
    "determining the hysteresis loop is then tantamount to counting the number of metastable states at fixed field as a function of their magnetization and finding the magnetization at which the complexity vanishes .",
    "the main difficulty is that one must count the _ typical _ ( _ i.e. _ most likely ) number of metastable states and compute the associated _ quenched _ complexity , which of course is a nontrivial task requiring the use of replicas .",
    "nevertheless , at least in principle , one can thereby study hysteresis and avalanche statistics without referring to the dynamical evolution .",
    "in the present paper we test this approach by studying the soft - spin version of the rfim introduced in ref.@xcite , where the spins take on continuous values between @xmath3 and @xmath4 and are confined by a bistable potential with a linear cusp .",
    "this model has the advantage over the standard rfim to show hysteresis for all values of the disorder in mean - field theory and is anyhow expected to behave as the hard - spin model on long length scales .",
    "our basic strategy is to express the complexity as the legendre transform of the ` free - energy ' associated to a certain action in replica space and then to use approximations borrowed from condensed - matter theory to calculate the corresponding correlation ( or green s ) functions and thermodynamic properties .",
    "our focus on the correlation functions is also motivated by analytical and numerical calculations on the bethe lattice which suggest that their spatial structure along the hysteresis loop is simpler than at equilibrium@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the model and the observables that we want to compute . in section iii",
    ", we introduce the general formalism in the context of a replica method , focusing on the various correlation functions . in section iv , we first consider the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) which is equivalent to mean - field theory and becomes exact in infinite dimension . in section v ,",
    "we go beyond the rpa by introducing a local self - energy approximation ( lsea ) and we compare the predictions for the magnetization , the correlation functions , and the second - moment of the avalanche - size distribution along the hysteresis loop to simulation data .",
    "concluding remarks and directions for future work are provided in section vi .",
    "additional details on the analytical calculations are provided in the appendix .",
    "we consider a collection of @xmath5 soft spins placed on the sites of a @xmath6-dimensional hypercubic lattice and interacting via the hamitonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a ferromagnetic interaction that couples nearest - neighbor spins , @xmath9 is an external uniform field , and @xmath10 is a set of quenched random fields drawn independently from a gaussian probability distribution @xmath11 with zero mean and variance @xmath12 .",

    "each metastable state is characterized at a macroscopic level by its magnetization , its energy , etc . in the present study ,",
    "we only focus on the magnetization since this is sufficient to unambiguously determine the hysteresis loop .",
    "our goal is then to compute properties averaged over all metastable states with a given magnetization @xmath27 per site at a given external magnetic field @xmath9 ( with a flat measure ) .",

    "the fact that there are no metastable states outside the saturation hysteresis loop is a trivial consequence of the so - called ` no - passing ' rule for ferromagnetic systems@xcite . on the other hand , to the best of our knowledge , there is yet no general proof that the complexity in the large - disorder regime is strictly positive _ everywhere _ inside the loop in the large - disorder regime ( within the formalism developed in this work , it may very well be that the complexity vanishes at some finite value of the auxiliary field @xmath78 , say @xmath523 ; this would imply that the number of metastable states does not grow exponentially with the system size for @xmath524 and therefore that the hysteresis loop , obtained in the limit @xmath71 , is not the convex hull of the metastable states ) .",
    "however , this seems quite unlikely , as illustrated by recent analytical and numerical calculations@xcite . on the other hand , in the low - disorder regime",
    ", it is conjectured that the region where the complexity is positive is non - convex , and the loss of convexity results in the macroscopic jump in the non - equilibrium magnetization curve ( since the response function @xmath525 must always be convex ) .",
