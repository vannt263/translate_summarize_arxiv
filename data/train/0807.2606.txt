    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) electron systems can nowadays be studied in different material systems , e.g.by depositing negatively charged metallic gate electrodes on top of a 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) in semiconducting heterostructures , thereby depleting the 2deg to form the desired structure,@xcite or in single - wall nanotubes ( swnts).@xcite such 1d quantum wires have been argued to realize the non - fermi liquid behavior of a _ tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll)_,@xcite arising as a consequence of electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions .",
    "experimental signatures of tll behavior include non - universal power laws in certain transport properties related to the tunneling density of states , but many other observables also may reflect the non - fermi liquid properties of a tll .",

    "this gives rise to interesting magnetic barrier and magnetic confinement effects.@xcite    it is well known , both theoretically@xcite and experimentally,@xcite that a magnetic - field gradient can give rise to unidirectional 1d snake states .",
    "such orbits were recently studied theoretically in graphene@xcite and in swnts.@xcite snake states carry current along the lines where the magnetic field changes sign , and hence is zero . on a classical level , they can be understood as half - orbits of different circulation sense ( for @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , patched together to form a unidirectionally propagating orbit.@xcite pairs of snake states running antiparallel to each other are referred to as double snake states.@xcite in many regards , double snake states correspond to the standard left- and right - movers in 1d quantum wires .",
    "for example , they should exhibit quantized conductance in multiples of @xmath16 ( including spin and valley degeneracies ) .",
    "since the snake states are spatially separated , this quantization should be robust : shallow impurities are not expected to cause scattering between snake modes of opposite directionality .    in this work ,",
    "we address consequences of the long - ranged but ultimately screened e - e interactions within and between the counterpropagating snake orbits in graphene magnetic waveguides . for a wide class of experimentally relevant field profiles , we show that a tll state with broken galilei invariance and extremely weak disorder sensitivity can be realized . on a general level , the importance of e - e interactions for the correct interpretation of experimental data in graphene",
    "has recently been stressed.@xcite theories describing e - e interaction effects on the transport properties of electrons in graphene have been proposed for strong homogeneous magnetic fields@xcite and for zero magnetic field.@xcite a recent debate has discussed the question whether interacting electrons in undoped graphene form a fermi liquid or not.@xcite interactions are also predicted to yield a tll state in special graphene nanoribbons with armchair edges.@xcite    for the related case of interacting metallic swnts , the effective low - energy theory predicts a four - channel tll state,@xcite where the spin and valley degrees of freedom give rise to the four channels .",

    "albeit the interaction does not spoil conductance quantization in dc transport for adiabatically connected reservoirs,@xcite it nevertheless destroys the fermi - liquid character of the system .",

    "most of our conclusions also apply ( at least qualitatively ) to magnetic waveguides based on traditional schrdinger fermions .",
    "we consider the class of magnetic field profiles given by @xmath39 in our gauge , we thus have @xmath40 the index @xmath41 can describe rather different situations , but we are only interested in @xmath41 being a natural number .",
