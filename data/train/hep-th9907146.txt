    "perturbative string theory is defined by series expansions based on the topologies of the string world - sheet , with the weights proportional to the action of string .",
    "the perturbation series can be presented as sum over different graphs which describe the `` joining - splitting''(js ) processes of strings as events in space - time .",
    "in fact these graphs are those which should be obtained as feynman graphs of a _ string field theory_. in spite of the absence of a complete string field theory , those graphs which are produced by small strings ( @xmath4 limit ) correspond to well known particle field theories namely various ( super ) gravity and gauge theories .",
    "so basically one expects to have a similar interpretation for js processes of particles and corresponding particle field theory graphs .    on the other hand , through the developments of understanding of m - theory as a m(atrix ) model @xcite , a description of perturbative light - cone string theory was achieved , based on a non - abelian gauge theory living on a 2d cylinder which in most times can be interpreted as the world - sheet of free strings .",
    "this description was mentioned in @xcite , more concreted in @xcite , and has been checked to produce the well known amplitudes in string theory @xcite . besides in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) it was argued that configurations with different lengths of strings and their js processes are corresponded to various backgrounds of world - sheet ( gauge ) fields . by the above picture for feynman graphs of strings ,",
    "it is the purpose of this letter to study similar ones for d - particles .",
    "it is argued that quantum traveling of d - particles are corresponded to graphs of a certain particle field theory and their amplitudes in the light - cone frame .",
    "so it provides the possibility of defining a particle field theory by its feynman graphs , those generated by js processes of d - particles .",
    "it is useful to compare our approach to d - particle dynamics and that of m(atrix ) model calculations @xcite . in the case of m(atrix ) model , because of large amount of supersymmetry , the d - particle action is trusted even for large separated d - particles ; where it is not expected the action to be valid @xcite . though it may be taken an advantage , but lacks using the action in non - supersymmetric case . in our approach",
    "the dynamics of d - particles is used exactly in the region of kinematical variables where the action is defined .",
    "it causes that the calculation of d - particle scattering amplitudes can be performed even in the non - supersymmetric case .",
    "the gauge theoretic description of interactions in bosonic case is supported by the result of @xcite for light - cone bosonic strings .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows . in the next section we review some important aspects of d - particle dynamics . in section 3 the correspondence between d - particle quantum mechanics and the light - cone field theory amplitudes",
    "is presented .",
    "section 4 is devoted to specification of the field theory in more details by estimating the masses of the intermediate states .",
    "section 5 is for conclusion .",
    "d@xmath5-branes are @xmath5 dimensional objects which are defined as ( hyper)surfaces which can trap the ends of strings @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of d - brane dynamics appears in their _",
    "coincident limit_. in the case of coinciding @xmath6 d@xmath5-branes , their dynamics are captured by dimensional reduction of @xmath7 gauge theory to @xmath8 dimensions of d@xmath5-brane world - volume @xcite .    for d - particles @xmath9 since only time exists in the world - line the above dynamics reduces to quantum mechanics of matrices .",
    "the bosonic action is @xcite [ 1.1 ] s = m_0 dt ( d_tx_i^2 + ^2 ) , i=1, ... ,d , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the string tension and the mass of d - particles respectively , and @xmath12 is string coupling . here",
    "@xmath13 acts as covariant derivative in the 0 + 1 dimensional gauge theory . for @xmath6",
    "d - particles @xmath14 s are in adjoint representation of @xmath7 and have the usual expansion @xmath15 , where @xmath16 s make basis of @xmath7 algebra .",
    "in fact this action is the result of the string theory calculation of d - brane interactions in the so - called _ gauge theory limit _ , defined by : [ 1.5 ] g_s & & 0 , + l_s & & 0 , + & = & fixed , + & = & fixed , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the relative velocities and distances involved in the kinematics of d - branes and @xmath19 is the string length .",
    "firstly let us search for d - particles in the above lagrangian : + for each direction @xmath20 there are @xmath21 variables instead of @xmath6 which one expects for @xmath6 particles .",
    "however there is a solution for the equations of motion which restricts the @xmath22 basis to the @xmath6 dimensional cartan subalgebra .",
    "this solution causes vanishing the potential and one finds the equations of motion for @xmath6 free particles . in this case",
    "the @xmath7 symmetry is broken to @xmath23 and the interpretation of @xmath6 remaining variables as the classical relative positions of @xmath6 particles is meaningful .",
    "the center of mass of d - particles is represented by the trace of the @xmath14 matrices and easily can be seen that the momentum of the center of mass is conserved .    in the case of unbroken gauge symmetry",
    "the gauge transformations mix the entries of matrices and the interpretation of positions for d - particles remains obscure @xcite .",
    "but even in this case the center of mass is meaningful and the ambiguity about positions only comes back to the relative positions of d - particles . in unbroken phase",
    "the @xmath24 non - cartan elements of matrices have a stringy interpretation ; they govern the dynamics of low lying oscillations of strings stretched between d - particles .",
    "let us study the limit @xmath4 more carefully . here",
    "this limit is analogous to the limit @xmath25 in @xcite . in this limit to have a finite energy one has to restrict @xmath14 s to [ 1.10 ] [ x_i , x_j]=0,i , j , and consequently vanishing the potential term in the action .",
    "so the classical action reduces to the action of @xmath6 free particles [ 1.15 ] s = dt _",
    "m_0 _ a^2 .",
    "however the above observation fails when d - particles arrive each other .",
    "when two d - particles come very near each other two eigenvalues of @xmath26 matrices will be equal and the corresponding off - diagonal elements can get non - zero values .",
    "this is the same story of gauge symmetry enhancement .",
    "the fluctuations of these off - diagonal elements are responsible for the interaction in d - particle bound - states .    in the non - coincident case",
    "we take simply the action ( [ 1.15 ] ) .",
    "it is based on our expectation for free d - branes in large seperations @xcite .",
    "for @xmath6 coincident d - particles one may write the action and hamiltonian as , [ 1.20 ] s = dt ( ( nm_0 ) ^2 + l_int(_a,_a)),a=1,2 , ... , n^2 - 1 , [ 1.25 ] h= + h_int(_a,_a ) , in which @xmath14 and @xmath27 are the position and momentum of the center of mass and @xmath28 s and @xmath29 s are the non - abelian positions and momenta .",
    "the dependences of energy eigenvalues and the size of bound states are notable . by the scalings @xcite t & & g_s^-1/3 t",
    ", + a_0 & & g_s^1/3 a_0 , + x & & g_s^1/3 x , one finds the relevant energy and size scales as e & ~ & g_s^1/3/l_s , + l_d+2&= & g_s^1/3l_s .",
    "the length scale @xmath30 should be the fundamental length scale of the covariant @xmath1 dimensional theory whose light - cone formulation is argued to be action ( [ 1.20 ] ) .",
    "this length is known to be the 11-dimensional planck length . ] in the weak coupling @xmath31 one finds @xmath32 which allows to treat the bound - states of finite number of d - particles as point like objects in the transverse dimensions of the light - cone frame . also consequently one finds @xmath33 which shows invariance under boost transformation of this combination .",
    "as we will see the mass of the intermediate states appear as @xmath34 .",
    "due to momentum conservation , @xmath6-particle states in light - cone frame have @xmath35 longitudinal momentum .",
    "on the other hand , the longitudinal momentum of a state plays the role of the newtonian mass in the transverse space of light - cone frame .",
    "so to have @xmath6-particle ( normalizable ) states the existence of marginal bound - states is necessary ; those which are defined by @xmath36 .",
    "so the energy - mass equivalence relation for them is read as e = m_n = nm_0 which in light - cone case we have @xmath37 .",
    "the existence of normalizable marginal bound - states in d - particle case is clarified for supersymmetric case @xcite , and also for bosonic case @xcite .",
    "here there are two possibilities to produce specified initial and final states , the so - called s- and t - channel processes .",
    "take the probability amplitude corresponded to detect four clusters of d - particles , those with masses @xmath38 and @xmath39 in positions @xmath40 and @xmath41 at time @xmath42 , and masses @xmath43 and @xmath44 in @xmath45 and @xmath46 at time @xmath47 , presented by path integral as [ 2.60 ] x_3 , x_4;t_f | x_1,x_2;t_i = ^-s , and supplied by the newtonian mass conservation n_1+n_2=n_3+n_4=n . in the limit @xmath4 one writes ( fig.1 ) [ 2.65 ] x_3 , x_4;t_f | x_1,x_2;t_i & = & _ +   & = & _ t_i^t_fdt_1 dt_2 _ -^ d^dx_1 d^dx_2 + & & ( k_n_1m_0(x_1,t_1;x_1,t_i ) k_n_2m_0(x_1,t_1;x_2,t_i ) ) + & & ( k_nm_0(x_2,t_2;x_1,t_1 ) k_int(x_2a=0,t_2 ; x_1a=0,t_1 ) ) + & & ( k_n_3m_0(x_3,t_f;x_2,t_2 ) k_n_4m_0(x_4,t_f;x_2,t_2 ) ) , which @xmath48 is the non - relativistic propagator of a free particle with mass @xmath49 between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the corresponding propagator for the non - abelian path integrations over @xmath53 . in the above",
    "@xmath54 is for a summation over different js times and points .",
    "it is assumed that the group @xmath55 for the position matrices is enhanced as @xmath56 at time @xmath57 and again is broken to @xmath58 at time @xmath59 .",
    "we use the representations in @xmath0 dimensions [ 2.40 ] k_m(y_2,t_2;y_1,t_1)&=&(t_2-t_1 ) d^dp ( ip(y_2-y_1)- ) , + k_int(x_2a , t_2;x_1a , t_1 ) & = & d_a ^-s_int[t_2,t_1]= _ n _ 2a|nn|_1a^-ie_n(t_2-t_1 ) , where @xmath60 s are the eigenvalues of @xmath61 of ( [ 1.25 ] ) and @xmath62 is the step function .",
    "it is more convenient to translate every thing to the momentum space by ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) [ 2.75 ] p_3,p_4,e_3,e_4;t_f |p_1 , p_2,e_1,e_2;t_i & ~ & ^i(e_3+e_4)t_f - i(e_1+e_2)t_i_k=1 ^ 4 d^dx_k + &  & ^i(p_1x_1+p_2x_2-p_3x_3-p_4x_4 ) x_3,x_4;t_f | x_1 , x_2;t_i , and doing all integrations one finds ( for @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) ] ] [ 2.85 ] p_3,p_4,e_3,e_4;|p_1 , p_2,e_1,e_2;-&~ & ^(d)(p_1+p_2-p_3-p_4)(e_1+e_2-e_3-e_4 ) + &  & _ 0^+ _ n , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "now recalling the energy - momentum relation in the light - cone frame for a particle with mass @xmath69 @xmath70 one sees that the fraction in the sum of ( [ 2.85 ] ) is the the light - cone propagator of a particle @xcite by identifications [ 2.90 ] q_+&=&nm_0 , + m_n^2&=&2nm_0 e_n .",
    "the first relation of ( [ 2.90 ] ) learns us that each d - particle has light - cone momentum equal to @xmath71 ; this is because to have the light - cone momentum @xmath72 for @xmath6 d - particles in the time interval @xmath73 $ ] ( fig.1 ) .",
    "so ( [ 2.85 ] ) is the same expression which one writes ( in momentum space ) as tree diagram contribution to 4-point function of a field theory but in the light - cone frame @xcite , with exchanging masses as @xmath74 s .",
    "it is noted that @xmath75 .    in a covariant form",
    "one writes for ( [ 2.85 ] ) [ 2.95 ] p_3^,p_4^;|p_1^ , p_2^;-&~ & ( p_1+p_2-p_3-p_4 ) ( p_-1+p_-2-p_-3-p_-4 ) + &  & _ 0^+ _ n , where @xmath76 and for any vector @xmath77 we have @xmath78 so @xmath79    the above considered amplitude for detecting four clusters of d - particles also can be studied in t - channel as ( fig.2 ) [ 2.105 ] x_3 , x_4;t_f | x_1,x_2;t_i&= & _ +   & = & _ t_i^t_fdt_1 dt_2 _ -^ d^dx_1",

    "this is because of the unique direction of time in light - cone frame ; see ( [ 2.40 ] ) .",
    "so for every propagation of particles , _",
    "e.g. _  intermediate states , propagations are from smaller time to bigger time .",
    "again by going to the momentum space and doing all integrations one finds ( for @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) [ 2.110 ] p_3,p_4,e_3,e_4;|p_1 , p_2,e_1,e_2;-&~ & ^(d)(p_1+p_2-p_3-p_4)(e_1+e_2-e_3-e_4 ) + &  & _ 0^+ _ n , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "again we have light - cone propagator of a particle @xcite by identifications [ 2.115 ] q_+&=&nm_0 , + m_n^2&=&2nm_0 e_n .    in a covariant form",
    "one writes for ( [ 2.110 ] ) [ 2.120 ] p_3^,p_4^;|p_1^ , p_2^;-&~ & ( p_1+p_2-p_3-p_4 ) ( p_-1+p_-2-p_-3-p_-4 ) + &  & _ 0^+ _ n , where @xmath83 .",
    "the question of `` what field theory ? '' is answered only by knowing the full set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xmath61 defined by , @xmath84 the knowledge about the spectrum of the interested hamiltonian is restricted . as is noted earlier the existence of zero - energy bound - states is discussed in @xcite .",
    "so , as the same of string theory , we have massless states which produce the low energy limit of the @xmath1 dimensional theory .    in the following we discuss another approach , the constant background .",
    "when two d - particles come very near each other two eigenvalues of @xmath26 matrices will become approximately equal and this makes the possibility that the corresponding off - diagonal elements take non - zero values .    in the coincident limit",
    "the dynamics is complicated .",
    "the relative matrix position may be taken as : x_i= ( ) , where @xmath85 is the complex conjugate of @xmath86 . by inserting this matrix in the lagrangian one",
    "obtains : s = dt ( ( 2m_0 ) ^2 + m_0 _ i_i^ * - m_0 ( 1-^2 ) x_j^2 y_iy_i^*+m_0 _",
    "j^2+o(y^3 ) ) , with @xmath14 for the center of mass and @xmath87 is the angle between @xmath88 and the complex vector @xmath89 .",
    "as is apparent in the limit @xmath4 which is in our direct interest , the @xmath90 element can not get large values and have a small range of variation .",
    "in high - tension approximation of strings , one takes the relative distance of d - particles constant and of order of bound - state size @xmath91 , as was mentioned in sec.2 .",
    "so one writes : s = dt ( ( 2m_0 ) ^2 + m_0 _ _ ^ * - m_0 y_y_^ * + ) , where in the above @xmath92 is an @xmath93 independent numerical factor , and @xmath94 is the perpendicular part of the @xmath89 to the relative distance @xmath88 . the parallel part of @xmath89 behaves as a free part . in @xmath95 dimensions of space - time",
    "the dimension of @xmath94 is @xmath96 which shows that we are encountered with @xmath97 harmonic oscillators because , @xmath86 is a complex variable .",
    "these harmonic oscillators are corresponded to vibrations of oriented open strings stretched between d - particles .    by translating all the above to the momentum space and doing the integrals",
