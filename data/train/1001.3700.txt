    "recent work has considerably enriched our detailed knowledge of the kinds of strongly coupled physics that can be studied using holographic studies of charged black holes .",
    "such studies are in fact quite old , since it was realized very shortly after the formulation of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite that electrically charged black holes allow for the study of non  trivial strongly coupled physics at finite density or chemical potential@xcite at both non  zero and zero temperature .",
    "a rich phase structure was uncovered in refs.@xcite , for ( finite volume ) systems dual to asymptotically ads spacetime backgrounds with reissner  nordstrm black holes in diverse dimensions .",
    "( see also the related work in refs.@xcite on the phase structure of certain scalar charged black holes . )    a decade after those studies a new wave of interest emerged , principally due to key observations about how charged black hole solutions to asymptotically ads einstein  maxwell systems ( sometimes coupled to scalars and fermions ) may pertain directly to holographic models of superconductivity @xcite and to holographic access to fermi surfaces@xcite .",
    "( note that the recent focus has been infinite volume system , therefore focusing on flat black holes . )    in the latter case ( refs.@xcite ) the system that displays fermi surface behaviour is a zero temperature reissner ",
    "nordstrm black hole with a probe fermion .",
    "the spectral function @xmath2 of the probe fermion in this background was shown , at @xmath3 and finite chemical potential @xmath4 , to exhibit a sharp peak at @xmath5 and finite @xmath6 .",
    "this peak has been interpreted as the quasiparticle pole at the edge of a fermi surface . here",
    "@xmath7 is identified with fermi energy above the chemical potential , @xmath8 . the dispersion associated with this peak",
    "was observed to be distinctly non  landau in a manner consistent with the quasiparticles being not effectively free ( as in standard landau theory ) , but in a strongly coupled phase .",
    "this is encouraging , since this type of behaviour is reminiscent of that which one might hope to gain understanding of in order to gain insight into various novel phenomena known from experiment in condensed matter physics ( see for example ref.@xcite for a review ) .",
    "several concerns arise here .",
    "not the least is that the while the results are suggestive , a quasiparticle peak alone ( especially for a minimally coupled non  backreacting fermion ) is not damning evidence for a fermi surface .",
    "some encouragement is to be found in ref .",
    "@xcite where they showed that at @xmath9 the peak broadened as a function of @xmath10 in the expected manner , but much more evidence is desirable .",
    "another concern is that the parallel studies of holographic superconductivity in the literature all strongly indicate that a charged scalar profile ( representing the condensate / order parameter ) would have developed at a critical temperature well above @xmath3 , and so an extremal reissner ",
    "nordstrm solution is presumably the wrong object to be studying for the @xmath11 physics at @xmath12 .",
    "( in fact , that an extremal black hole is probably excluded from this point of the phase diagram was already suggested a decade ago@xcite , since there is an expected decay channel due to super ",
    "radiance effects@xcite , inherited from the fact that the charged black holes are really dimensional reductions of spinning d3branes . ) the approximate holographic superconductivity studied in refs .",
    "@xcite suggest that at @xmath11 the system would be ( at best ) a scalar  profiled charged black hole ( _ i.e. _ not reissner  nordstrm ) and so one might argue that this is the system to which the spectral analysis should be applied . however , further study in a fully backreacted m ",
    "theory context@xcite has shown that the black hole nature of the system entirely vanishes at @xmath11 .",
    "an ads background re  emerges at @xmath11 instead .",
    "this may all fit well with the expectation that if the system has become superconducting below some @xmath13 the fermi surface may well no longer be available , although it remains to be seen what the appropriate study might reveal .",
    "with all these concerns up front , it is our view that the work of refs .",
    "@xcite remains of considerable value .",
    "it is a simple , remarkable system with many of the key features of interest for some of the studies , since away from @xmath11 , at high enough temperature , a charged black hole will still be relevant .",
    "the techniques developed and insights gained in this study , even if the system is not exactly the right one , will be of value in the broader context .    in this spirit",
    ", we continue the study that we began of the reissner  nordstrm system and the putative fermi surface in the presence of a background magnetic field @xmath1 . in our first paper@xcite",
    ", we studied a dyonic black hole , the magnetic component now playing the role of an external magnetic field of the system . on general grounds ,",
    "one expects the system to develop an infinite set of landau levels , the quantized energy levels of the fermions in the magnetic field .",
    "our first paper studied the lowest landau level , and already we saw interesting physics , including multiple quasiparticle peaks and a magnetic field dependence in the dispersion characteristic of the peaks .",
    "the non  zero magnetic field case has peaks appearing at @xmath14 since now the energy of the fermions has been increased as compared to the @xmath15 system , for a given  @xmath4 .",
    "so even for the lowest landau level , the peak is at @xmath16 , as we saw in ref.@xcite .",
    "this lowest landau level has a boundary condition for the probe fermion at the horizon that is constructed from the zeroth hermite function . in this paper",
    "we will study more general boundary conditions corresponding to the @xmath0th hermite function , and we find a family of quasiparticle peaks signalling the presence of a fermi surface at each such  @xmath0 . each value of  @xmath0 , for fixed chemical potential @xmath4 , is a distinct landau level for the probe fermion .",
    "there are two distinct classes of solution that we present and study here .",
    "one class is separable ( section  [ sec : separable ] ) and the other can be understood as an infinite sum of the separable solutions ( section  [ sec : non - separable ] ) .",
    "the first , adopted in the work of refs.@xcite , does _ not _ have a smooth limit to the @xmath17 case ( for general momentum @xmath18 ) . as a result",
    ", we find it less compelling as a basis for the generalization of the results and methods of ref.@xcite for the purposes of identifying fermi surfaces by searching for quasiparticle peaks , since the method requires that the location ( in ( @xmath19 ) ) of the peaks in the spectral function @xmath20 ( generically appearing at non  zero @xmath18 ) be read off from the system , and not fixed by hand .",
    "we stress that there is nothing wrong with studying the separable class of solutions , for the appropriate kind of physics of interest .",
    "rather , we are noting that it does not connect to the @xmath17 physics in a way that allows an analysis of the fermi surface physics in the spirit of the prototype case of ref.@xcite . following from this , we note in section  [ sec : separable ] that the choices made in ref.@xcite , when taken to their logical conclusion ( performing the required fourier transform to construct the spectral function ) , lead to no quasiparticle peaks at all .",
    "by contrast , the infinite  sum class , which we began the study of in ref.@xcite , has a smooth limit to the @xmath17 case , as we discuss in section  [ sec : non - separable ] , and we carry out the search for quasiparticle peaks and display our results in section  [ sec : numerical_results ] .",
    "to set the stage and for later comparison with the more complicated case , we begin by studying a free fermion with mass @xmath21 charged under a global @xmath22 . the dirac action is : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the classical equations of motion are given by : @xmath25 let us first consider the case of zero magnetic field , taking only @xmath26 to be non  zero .",
    "if we choose : @xmath27 and take an ansatz of the form : @xmath28 then the equations of motion reduce to ( for @xmath29 ) : @xmath30 the solutions are then given by : @xmath31 note in particular that at @xmath32 , the non  trivial solution is simply @xmath33 with no restriction on @xmath34 .",
    "let us now consider turning on a magnetic field .",
    "taking @xmath35 , and following a similar procedure as above ( with @xmath36 now depending on @xmath37 as well ) , we find as equations of motion : @xmath38 let us assume at present that @xmath39 and @xmath40 and define a new coordinate @xmath41 as : @xmath42 in terms of which the equation of motion simplifies to : @xmath43 if we consider solutions of the form : @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the standard hermite functions defined in terms of the hermite polynomials @xmath46 as : @xmath47 we have the requirement that : @xmath48 another solution is given by : @xmath49 the solutions for the fields are the same as before , but now we have the requirement : @xmath50 let us now consider the case of @xmath51 .",
    "the analysis is mostly the same , except that we now define @xmath41 as : @xmath52 this modifies the equation of motion to : @xmath53 the solutions to this equation are given by : @xmath54 and @xmath55 in particular , we note that flipping the sign on the magnetic field interchanges the @xmath41 dependence for @xmath36 .",
    "finally , let us study the zero magnetic field limit , which is a delicate issue .",
    "we first point out that the coordinate change presented in equation ( [ eqt : eta ] ) is singular in the limit of zero magnetic field , so it is not a particularly good basis for studying this limit .",
    "however , one might think that in order for the restriction on @xmath7 to match , we have to choose : @xmath56 however , in this limit , the functions @xmath45 behave as : @xmath57 so both @xmath58 and @xmath59 vanish in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "this does not match the zero magnetic field solution we found earlier .",
    "we can perhaps compensate for this vanishing by including an @xmath0dependent overall normalization of our fields @xmath36 , but we emphasize that this issue is not present when @xmath32 . there",
    ", no special limit needs to be taken on @xmath0 and the hermite functions go to a constant in the limit of @xmath60 .",
    "this sort of property will occur in our full probe fermion problem later , for one class of solutions ( separable ) that we will discuss .",
    "there will be another class of solutions ( infinite  sum ) that will not suffer from this limitation , having a smooth @xmath61 limit for arbitrary @xmath18 .",
    "this latter class is naturally amenable to being used to search for fermi surfaces by looking for quasiparticle peaks in the spectral function , since these peaks will naturally occur at non ",
    "zero @xmath18 which we wish to read off as output , and not fix _ a priori_.",

    "the negative cosmological constant sets the length scale @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and the einstein ",
    "maxwell action is : @xmath67 where we use signature @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",

    "we choose a gauge such that : @xmath74 which sets a chemical potential @xmath75 and a magnetic field @xmath76 .",
    "we choose to work at zero temperature , which restricts @xmath77 and @xmath78 to satisfy : @xmath79 as discussed in our first paper@xcite , it is important to realize that this equation does _ not _ place a restriction on the magnetic field for a given value of @xmath77 . the important quantity to hold fixed",
    "while varying the magnetic field is the chemical potential @xmath4 , and as @xmath77 decreases for increasing @xmath78 , @xmath64 increases to compensate , resulting in the physical magnetic field @xmath1 being able to run its full natural range from zero to infinity .",

    "if we write : @xmath107 then the functions @xmath108 can be written : @xmath109 ( with analogous expressions for the fourier transforms @xmath110 , with @xmath111 instead of @xmath112 ) such that the relevant green function quantities are simply : @xmath113 to solve for the fields @xmath114 , we define : @xmath115 the equations of motion for the fields @xmath116 when @xmath29 is given by : @xmath117 these are the equations of motion we presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "expanding the equations of motion at the event horizon , we find ( for @xmath16 ) the following conditions : @xmath118 ( there are analogous equations for @xmath119 , but we do not list them here since we will not find quasiparticle peaks at @xmath119 . ) there is some freedom in choosing the boundary conditions for the fields , leading to very different physics .",
    "we present two particular choices in the next two sections .",
    "we restrict ourselves at present to @xmath120 .",
    "changing coordinates to : @xmath121 we can write the @xmath37dependent parts of our equations above as : @xmath122 there are two possible anstze that we can make : @xmath123 or @xmath124 we emphasize that the ansatz with @xmath125 and @xmath126 is not consistent with the first order equations .",
    "let us start with the first ansatz . if we write : @xmath127 then the solution takes the form : @xmath128 where @xmath45 is the hermite function defined in section  [ sec : freefermion ] . note that @xmath129 . with this ansatz .",
    "we considered them in our work in ref.@xcite for @xmath130 , but focused on the infinite  sum solutions for the rest of that paper .",
    "the lack of a smooth @xmath131 limit for @xmath132 , combined with the desire to seek quasiparticle peaks at non  zero @xmath18 , led us away from these separable cases .",
    "we will discuss this more below .",
    "] , the equations of motion in the bulk become : @xmath133 if we consider the second ansatz , we can write : @xmath134 which has solutions given by : @xmath135 and the equations of motion reduce to equations  ( [ eq : become ] ) , the same set of equations of motion that resulted from the first ansatz .",
    "so in this case , the behavior in the @xmath80 direction is independent of our choice .",
    "we will return to the issue of this freedom later .",
    "we proceed with calculating the green function given by equation ( [ eqt : green ] ) , where all the fields have been fourier transformed in both @xmath136 coordinates .",
    "note that in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , no fourier transform was performed for the @xmath37 coordinate .",
    "the fourier transform of the hermite functions is given by : @xmath137 where the normalization @xmath138 was given in equation  ( [ eq : hermite ] ) .",
    "let us compare to the results and methods of ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath61 . there",
    ", the choice @xmath139 is made , and we can examine the physics of the solution we have here at @xmath140 for @xmath141 to see how it connects .",
    "if we restrict to @xmath139 , we find that for @xmath0 odd , the fourier transform of @xmath142 vanishes .",
    "therefore , when @xmath0 is even , only @xmath143 survive when using the first ansatz , whereas only @xmath144 survive when using the second ansatz .",
    "when instead @xmath0 is odd , only @xmath145 survive for the first ansatz and only @xmath146 survive when using the second ansatz . therefore ,",
    "if we wish our retarded green function to be positive , we must use the first ansatz to describe even modes and the second ansatz to describe odd modes .",
    "this gives : @xmath147 let us now consider the @xmath60 limit of our solutions .",
    "as shown earlier for the free fermion in 2 + 1 dimensions , the hermite functions in terms of @xmath41 do not have nice behavior as @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , the green function presented above in the @xmath60 limit can not match the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , since their results at @xmath148 are a constant only at @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , these results suggest that this choice of solutions ( used , crucially , in ref.@xcite to discuss fermi surfaces ) is not connected to the pole found in ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath61 , but they form a separate set of solutions present at non ",
    "zero magnetic field .",
    "we complete our discussion of this set of solutions by considering the case of @xmath149 .",
    "the coordinate change is now given by : @xmath150 under the change of variables , the @xmath37dependent part becomes : @xmath151 if we now consider our two anstz from before , we find that ansatz 1 results in : @xmath152 and ansatz 2 gives : @xmath153 both these anstze give exactly the same equation of motion as before with the appropriate modification under the square root : @xmath154 in turn this suggests that when @xmath51 , the even modes are associated with ansatz 2 and the odd modes are associated with ansatz 1 .",
    "this is the opposite of what occurred when @xmath155 .",
    "let us summarize our results so far : @xmath156 note the close similarity between these results and the results found for the free fermion in @xmath157 dimensions .",
    "we find here that for a given ansatz , the single dirac spinor in the @xmath158dimensional background contains both solutions that were found for the free fermion . under the flip of the magnetic field for a given ansatz",
    ", we find the same flipping of the @xmath41 dependence between each 2component spinors .",
    "in addition , the flipping of the magnetic field interchanges the roles of the two anstze for describing the modes , which suggests that they may describe aligned _ vs. _ anti  aligned couplings .",
    "these results indicate that the even modes and odd modes should be understood as describing two distinct ladders .",
    "the separable solutions presented so far have two unfortunate features . because of the solutions dependence on the coordinate @xmath41",
    ", the solutions have singular behavior in the zero magnetic field limit . to connect these solutions to the zero magnetic field solution",
    ", one has to take a limit similar to that of equation ( [ eqt : limit1 ] ) , where the landau level label @xmath0 goes to infinity : @xmath159 independent of this fact , considering the separable solutions alone leads to a trivial green function , as presented in equation ( [ eqt : trivialgreen ] ) .",
    "we wish to proceed by studying a class of solutions that avoids these two features . in order to avoid singularities associated with the coordinate @xmath41",
    ", we wish to consider solutions that depend on the coordinate @xmath37 as opposed to @xmath41 .",
    "let us take the case of @xmath39 .",
    "motivated by the separable solutions discussed earlier , focusing on the behaviour at the horizon ( @xmath73 ) , we consider @xmath160 for even @xmath0 and @xmath161 for odd @xmath0 . for @xmath0",
    "even we take : @xmath162 such that we have @xmath163 .",
    "we can write this ansatz in terms of our separable solutions from the previous section , @xmath164 and similarly for the other fields .",
    "the coefficients @xmath165 can be determined from the field behavior at the event horizon .",
    "for example , for @xmath166 , the coefficients @xmath165 are given by : @xmath167 in the limit of @xmath60 , the infinite sum remains finite _ without _ requiring us to take a limit of the form of equation ( [ eqt : limit2 ] ) .",
    "we do not need to take @xmath168 since the infinite sum effectively does this by defining a new landau level labeling in terms of an infinite sum of the landau labels of the separable solutions ( _ i.e. _ the labeling of @xmath169 instead of @xmath170 ) .",
    "because of the nature of the infinite sum , it is important to first perform the sum and then take the limit of @xmath60 to ensure the correct result .",
    "we emphasize that the infinite sum gives us the freedom to vary the new landau level label as well as @xmath18 independently while sending @xmath60 , a freedom we did not have with the separable solutions presented earlier .",
    "this is an important difference from the separable solutions we considered in the previous section .    by substituting the series form of the fields from equation ( [ eqt : series ] ) into the equations of motion ,",
    "the partial differential equation becomes an infinite series of coupled ordinary differential equations for @xmath171 , where the coupled equations are identical to those of equations ( [ eq : become ] ) .",
    "we have traded the partial differential equation for an infinite number of coupled ordinary differential equations .",
    "we choose to proceed by solving the partial differential equation using an ansatz that is not explicitly separable since this is more tractable numerically .    with this ansatz",
    ", we find that : @xmath172 we notice that for @xmath32 , we find that @xmath173 , which agrees with the separable solution from the previous section .",
    "finally , we have : @xmath174 where we have used that : @xmath175 note again that for @xmath32 , we recover that @xmath176 which is the single separable solution presented earlier .",
    "in addition , note that for @xmath130 we recover the equations that we had in ref .",
    "for @xmath0 odd , we take : @xmath177 such that we have @xmath178 . with this ansatz",
    ", we find that : @xmath179 the advantage of this choice over the finitely separable choice from the previous section is that in the @xmath60 limit , the equations of motion and fields reduce to those of ref.@xcite with no restrictions placed on @xmath0 . in addition , since at @xmath32 , the fields reduce to the simple separable case discussed earlier , we can immediately write the green function for this special case : @xmath180 which connects nicely with the zero magnetic field @xmath181 result of ref.@xcite . furthermore , for @xmath182 , the green function gives a non  trivial result , as opposed to the separable case which gave a trivial result ( see equation ( [ eqt : trivialgreen ] ) ) .",

    "in addition , in order for the pole in the green function to be associated with a quasiparticle , the pole must have non  zero residue . in our analysis , we restrict ourselves to @xmath186 , and therefore our search for poles is such that the lifetime of the mode is always infinite .",
    "away from the poles , the numerical results should not be taken too seriously since away from the poles , one should consider a complex @xmath7 and not a purely real  @xmath7 .",
    "this is relevant because in our numerics the poles occur immediately after a region where the imaginary part of the green function is negative , which is not allowed if the theory is unitary .",
    "we believe that the proper treatment of the complex @xmath7 in these regions would resolve this .",

    "@xcite shows that the pole for @xmath61 bounces off the real axis , and in the purely real analysis the imaginary part of the green function remains positive on both sides of the pole .",

    "fig : w_vs_h ] we plot the behavior of the poles at fixed @xmath0 for varying @xmath78 , for a few sample values of @xmath0 , choosing of @xmath0 such that it falls in the regime where @xmath191 behaves regularly with  @xmath0 .",
    "using these ( and much more ) data , we can attempt to fit the behavior of @xmath185 with the magnetic field and @xmath0 , for large @xmath0 , giving : @xmath194 for how well this function fits the data , see figure [ fig : w_vs_h ] .",
    "in particular , we find that the fit improves for larger @xmath78 and larger @xmath0 .",
    "the exact numbers associated with the scaling of @xmath78 and @xmath0 are not as important as the fact that they deviate from the free relativistic fermion behavior which would have both scaling with exponent @xmath195 .",
    "another important characteristic of these poles is the rate at which the peak is approached as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "this is the dispersion of the quasiparticles associated with that peak , and it can be read off from our numerical searches quite readily . in our earlier paper@xcite",
    ", we found that non ",
    "zero @xmath78 modified the behaviour seen in ref.@xcite . in particular , a peak at higher @xmath18 had more linear ( _ i.e. _ landau  like ) dispersion .",
    "we observe that the same is true for all @xmath0 .",
    "note however that from figure  [ fig : h=0_1_second ] it can be seen that , for the second class of peaks ( the one that persist for all @xmath0 ) , at higher @xmath0 , the peaks are at successively _ lower _ values of @xmath18 ( in either the even or odd @xmath0 sequence ) .",
    "we show some sample dispersion behavior of the poles at fixed @xmath78 but different @xmath0 in figure [ fig : dispersion ] .",
    "we have generalized the work of ref .",
    "@xcite to include an infinite number of excitations labeled by @xmath0 .",
    "different @xmath0 correspond to different landau levels for the probe fermion in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "we studied in detail two separate classes of solution , leading to distinct physics .",
    "one class is separable ( it is used in the work of refs.@xcite ) and the other is an infinite sum of the separable solutions ( studied for @xmath130 in our first paper@xcite ) .",
    "both classes are probably physical , but the first class does not allow a smooth @xmath61 limit for arbitrary  @xmath18 , and so seems less suitable for discussion of quasiparticle peaks and fermi surfaces in the spirit of ref.@xcite , which is our focus ( and that of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in fact , we argued that the separable solutions have a _ constant _ green function at @xmath141 when the @xmath37dependence is included in the green function definition , which differs from the argument presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the infinite  sum solutions have key properties that make them attractive .",
    "they limit to the @xmath61 solution smoothly for arbitrary @xmath0 , with non  trivial dependence on @xmath18 .",
    "this is the class of solutions we use to find quasiparticle peaks for all the landau levels  @xmath0 .",
    "note that since @xmath7 depends on @xmath18 , these landau levels do not have the usual degeneracy found for the free fermion landau levels .",
    "we also noted that levels given by even @xmath0 and odd @xmath0 form distinct towers , distinguished by a relative energy shift ( that diminishes as @xmath0 increases ) that suggests a aligned / anti  aligned coupling to the magnetic field .",
    "the difference between even and odd stems from two different choices one can make at the event horizon .",
    "we also noticed that the family of quasiparticle peaks , at sufficiently large @xmath0 , has a dependence on @xmath78 and @xmath0 that is different that of the relativistic massless free fermion .",
    "in fact the exponent lies between the free relativistic value of @xmath195 and the non  relativistic value of unity .",
    "this is consistent with our quasiparticles possibly having an induced mass .",
