    "neutron stars accreting from disks tend towards a state of rotational equilibrium with the disk . in the equilibrium state",
    "the rotation rate of the star is equal or close to the keplerean rotation rate at the inner boundary of the disk , which is the alfven radius where the magnetic stresses of the @xmath0 magnetic field of the star balance the material stresses in the disk accretion flow and thereby disrupt the disk .",
    "the recently discovered accreting and bursting pulsar igr j17480 - 2446 in the globular cluster terzan 5 attracts attention with its high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) at frequencies of 48 , 173 and 814 hz , much higher than the rotation frequency of 11 hz ( papitto et al 2011 ) .",
    "the rotation rate itself stands out as rather slow for neutron stars in globular clusters which typically contain radio millisecond pulsars and accreting x - ray millisecond pulsars .",
    "igr j17480 - 2446 is still undergoing spin - up by accretion ( patruno et al 2011 ) .",
    "the identification of the high qpo frequencies is an intriguing question . a combination of very slow rotation rate and very high frequency qpo is also observed from the soft gamma repeaters sgr 1806 - 20 ( p = 5.2 s ) and sgr 1900 + 14 ( p = 7.5 s ) , which may be surrounded by an accretion flow according to the fallback disk model ( alpar 2001 ; chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the higher frequency scales associated with the higher multipoles in a magnetosphere in rotational equilibrium with the disk at the dipole alfven radius .",
    "the boundary between an accretion disk and the magnetosphere of a star is primarily determined by balancing the magnetic stresses due to the longest range , dipole , component of the star s magnetic field against the material stresses of the accretion flow in the disk , yielding the conventional alfven radius @xmath1 here the subscript refers to @xmath2 1 for dipole , @xmath3 is the mass of the neutron star , @xmath4 the gravitational constant and @xmath5 is the dipole magnetic moment of the star .",
    "thus @xmath6 is the stopping radius at which the dipole magnetic field of the star disrupts the quasi - keplerean flow of the material in the accretion disk .",
    "the alfven radius is defined by the balance of the material stresses @xmath7 against the magnetic stresses @xmath8 .",
    "the density @xmath9 arriving at the alfven radius is related to the mass transfer rate @xmath10 arriving from the disk : @xmath11 where the factor @xmath12 describes the geometry of the non - spherical flow , and also serves to scale the velocity of the flow to the kepler and free fall velocities , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "( i have scaled the definition of @xmath12 with @xmath13 rather than @xmath15 to incorporate the factor of @xmath16 . )",
    "close to the dipole alfven radius the accretion disk has a boundary or transition region within which the rotation rate @xmath17 adjusts from keplerean rotation towards corotation with the star and magnetosphere .",
    "the term transition region will denote a region , not necessarily extremely thin , where the flow adapts to a new configuration .",
    "inward of the dipole alfven radius , at @xmath18 , the magnetosphere is loaded with accreting matter which follows magnetic field lines towards the star , acquiring some radial velocity commensurate with free - fall and gradually adopting to co - rotation , starting from quasi - keplerean azimuthal velocities beyond @xmath6 .",
    "the actual magnetosphere - disk interaction and the behaviour of the accretion flow is likely to be rather complicated .",
    "the magnetic axis of the neutron star is in general not aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "moreover , the stellar field is likely to contain higher multipoles .",
    "there is evidence for the presence of higher multipoles of the magnetic field in classical t - tauri stars ( eg . donati et al 2011a , b and references therein ) , and accreting white dwarfs ( eg . euchner et al .",
    "2006 , beuermann et al .",
    "multipole magnetic fields on neutron stars are required by some models of pulsar emission mechanisms ( gil , melikidze & mitra 2002 ; mitra , konar & bhattacharya 1999 and references therein ) , and in models for the pulse shapes of thermal x - ray emission from millisecond pulsars ( cheng & taam 2003 ) .",
    "mitra et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have investigated the decay of neutron star magnetic fields by diffusion through the crust .",
    "they find that an initial field configuration with comparable strengths in the different multipoles decays and settles to a steady configuration at a few percent of the initial field strengths after decay timescales of 10@xmath19 - 10@xmath20 yrs .",
    "multipoles up to @xmath21 remain comparable to the dipole component in the final state of the surface magnetic field . a distinction between dipole and higher multipole components of magnetars , and",
    "the idea that magnetar fields reside in the higher multipoles has been proposed in the context of the fallback disk model , most recently for sgr 0418 with its observed upper limit on the dipole component of the field far below the magnetar range ( alpar , ertan & alikan 2011 and references therein ) .",
    "the accretion flow onto a neutron star with higher multipoles and non - aligned magnetic and rotation axes will have strong directional dependence .",
    "aspects of the accreting magnetosphere problem have been investigated in 3-d numerical simulations for dipole fields ( koldoba et al 2002 , romanova et al 2002 , 2004 ) , and for configurations involving quadrupole ( long , romanova & lovelace 2007 , 2008 ) and octupole ( long , romanova & lamb 2012 ) fields . the numerical investigations show spatially localized signatures of various distinct distance scales and complicated funnel flows . as in the example of simulations of accretion onto a magnetosphere with tilted dipole and quadrupole fields ( long , romanova & lovelace 2008 ) these flows can be almost stationary .",
    "unstable accretion has been investigated for accretion onto dipole fields ( kulkarni & romanova 2008 , romanova , kulkarni & lovelace 2008 ) .",
    "transient tongues of accretion protruding into the magnetosphere with complicated patterns are found .",
    "if higher multipoles are present together with the dipole , the instabilities encountered by the accretion flow facing the dipole field will let the flow penetrate the magnetosphere to interact with the higher multipoles at distances closer to the star .",
    "simulations of accretion onto dipole fields have produced qpo ( kulkarni & romanova 2009 , bachetti et al 2010 ) .",
    "determination of the quality of these qpos to compare with the high q of the observed qpo is not yet possible , due to the limited time span of the simulations .",
    "as yet qpo have not been reported from simulations of accretion onto higher multipole fields .",
    "one can estimate the distance and frequency scales that correspond to the interaction between multipole components of the star s magnetic field and the accretion flow .",
    "our purpose here is to explore these frequency scales , without going into the discussion of how particular frequencies might be excited .",
    "the radial dependence of multipole component @xmath22 of the magnetic field is : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath22th multipole moment , @xmath25 is a fiducial magnetic field value on the star s surface , and @xmath26 is the stellar radius ( jackson 1998 ) .",
    "for simplicity i will label the multipole fields only with @xmath22 , rather than @xmath27 . @xmath28",
    "correspond to dipole , quadrupole and octupole fields respectively .",
    "individual components of the magnetic field will have the @xmath29 and @xmath30 dependence characteristic of the multipole .",
    "generalized alfven radii for pure single multipole fields were discussed earlier by lipunov ( 1978 ) and long , romanova & lamb ( 2011 ) .",
    "psaltis & chakrabarty ( 1999 ) gave expressions for the kepler frequencies associated with the generalized alfven radii for single multipole fields .",
    "the situation is more complicated when the field contains several multipole components . as the accretion flow approaches the star along the magnetic field lines it encounters varying magnetic field stresses in different directions . in general the different multipole axes",
    "are not aligned with each other , so that there is no axial symmetry , @xmath31 , with respect to the dipole axis .",
    "the surface on which material and magnetic stresses balance will have a complicated geometry , depending on the relative strengths of the different magnetic multipole moments and the inclination between the magnetic and rotation axes of the star . as higher multipole components of the magnetic field dominate closer to the star s surface , one can delineate a succession of ( generalized ) alfven stopping radii for the higher multipoles .",
    "these stopping radii are the characteristic distances of the complicated matter - magnetic field interaction in the magnetosphere . at the generalized alfven radius for each successive multipole ,",
    "the magnetic stresses change slope as a function of the distance @xmath32 from the star .",
    "this leads to pockets of density accumulation .",
    "the generalized alfven radii for multipoles @xmath22 satisfy @xmath33 where @xmath34 relates the local density @xmath35 in the pocket to the total mass accretion rate @xmath10 through the factor @xmath36 .",
    "equation ( 4 ) is a simple extension of the formula for generalized alfven radii for an accretion flow facing a pure single multipole field ( lipunov 1978 , long romanova & lamb 2011 ) , differing by the factor @xmath36 .",
    "when a single multipole is present , this factor depends on the orientation of the multipole axis with respect to the disk . with several multipole components the accretion flow balances against the total field .",
    "how the total mass accretion rate @xmath10 splits into various accretion funnels towards the different multipole stopping radii and what @xmath35 and @xmath37 are in each location depend in a complicated way on the relative strengths of the different multipoles and on the angles between the various multipole symmetry axes .",
    "when several misaligned multipoles are present , eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) do not determine the stopping radii for each multipole independently of the others , with some simple geometrical assumption for @xmath36 reflecting a thin or thick disk or spherical geometry .",
    "rather , all multipoles , with their different misalignment angles , must be taken into account jointly and consistently - a task that can be realistically undertaken only with numerical simulations .",
    "analytical models developed for accretion onto ttauri stars can provide guidelines to the problem ( gregory et al 2006 , gregory & donati 2011 and references therein ) .",
    "these models use current free magnetospheres . the actual situation or the outcome of a numerical calculation",
    "can be expressed in terms of the physical channeling fractions @xmath36 in the simultaneous presence of the multipole fields in interaction with the accretion flow , which enter eq .",
    "( 4 ) in the combination @xmath38 .",
    "these channelling fractions are likely to have a sensitive dependence on the geometry , and it is not possible to separate them from the physically interesting surface fields in estimates using eq . ( 4 ) .",
    "instead , i shall employ below a qualitative picture of the interaction of the mass accretion with the superposition of multipole fields .",
    "without any accretion flow , the distance scales @xmath39 where the multipole field strength matches the dipole @xmath40 are determined by the surface fields alone , @xmath41 the radii where the strength of multipole @xmath22 matches that of the previous multipole @xmath22 -1 are @xmath42 equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) are for multipole fields in vacuum , with no reference to any interaction with an accretion flow .",
    "the distance scales @xmath39 and",
    "@xmath43 refer to the balance between different components of the field and constitute only a rough guide for the stopping radi where the various multipoles assume the prime role in balancing and channeling the accretion flow .    in the following",
    "we shall make an estimation of the successive generalized alfven radii based on a qualitative picture of the balance between the accretion flow and a multicomponent magnetic field .",
    "each multipole field has its `` easy '' directions at @xmath44 values where it has a significant radial component .",
    "the flow guided along the field lines in these directions will also be accelerated towards the star by gravity .",
    "accreting matter loaded onto the dipole field lines at the conventional dipole alfven radius will flow towards the poles , in the easy direction of the dipole field .",
    "when the quadrupole axis is not aligned with the dipole axis , the easy dipole directions towards the poles do not coincide with the easy directions of the quadrupole field .",
    "those components of the magnetic stress energy tensor to which the dipole field has negligible contribution at these directons of the flow , are dominated by the contributions of the quadrupole field .",
    "these stress components become important in balancing the material stresses and channelling the flow as matter approaches the star and the quadrupole field strength increases .",
    "thus the accretion flow will eventually face a barrier at a quadrupole stopping radius , of the order of the quadrupole alfven radius .",
    "the newly important components of the stress energy tensor , contributed by the quadrupole field , should be strong enough to balance the material stresses which are of the order of the material stresses ( and therefore the balancing magnetic stresses ) at the dipole alfven radius .",
    "note that the overall energy density in the dipole field here at the quadrupole stopping radius can be significantly higher than its value at the dipole alfven radius , but it is the stresses in new directions , introduced by the quadrupole field that define the balance between the magnetosphere and the accretion flow .",
    "the flow will now be diverted by the dominant quadrupole component of the magnetic field , to follow the field lines in non - radial directions until the magnetic field lines curve , towards the star following the easy directions of the quadrupole field , which in turn do not coincide with easy directions of the octupole field . as the octupole component starts to dominate in the total magnetic field",
    "the flow is again diverted at the octupole stopping radius , following the octupole dominated field in non - radial directions until now the octupole field lines start curving towards the star , along the easy directions for the misaligned octupole field , and so on , if there are higher multipoles .",
    "figure 1 shows a simple sketch illustrating these ideas for a magnetic field with misaligned dipole and quadrupole components .",
    "the presence of several different stopping distances and associated accretion pockets is clearly seen in figures depicting the 3-d simulations performed for combinations of dipole , quadrupole and octupole fields ( see figures 4 & 5 in long , romanova & lovelace 2007 ; figures 5 , 9 & 15 in long , romanova & lovelace 2008 ; and figures 14 & 17 in long , romanova & lamb 2011 ) .",
    "a surface of some complicated geometry will join the multipole stopping fronts with the conventional dipole alfven surface .",
    "this convolved surface forms a boundary with the accretion flow with higher densities on the side away from the star .",
    "the flow following the field lines forms pockets towards the star along easy directions of the multipole fields .",
    "( in the simple case of a pure dipole the easy directions lead to the polar caps ) .",
    "the generalized alfven or stopping radii define the minima of this surface . at all points on this surface",
    "the magnetic field balances the stresses from the accretion flow .",
    "the directions of the stresses change but we take the magnitude to be comparable to the pressure defining the largest stopping radius , the dipole alfven radius at the maxima of the surface . this is still a rough estimate : the energy per particle will increase with decreasing radius due to fall in the gravitational potential well , while the density @xmath9 is likely to be less than the value at the inner edge of the accretion disk at the dipole alfven radius , due to branching of the accretion flow as also represented in the unknown factors @xmath36 .",
    "we take the relevant stress components over different parts of the surface to be comparable and of typical value given by @xmath45 , and postulate that the generalized alfven radii for multipoles @xmath22 satisfy @xmath46 which gives @xmath47 where @xmath48 in equations ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) we have two different ways of estimating the multipole stopping radii .",
    "equation ( 6 ) makes a comparison of the multipole feld strengths as if thses were vacuum fields , without taking into account the presence of the accretion flow .",
    "( 9 ) is based on balancing the magnetic stresses at the multipole stopping radii against the material stress on the convoluted boundary of the magnetosphere , as defined at the outermost , dipole stopping radius , the conventional alfven radius .",
    "the results of both estimates were compared with the stopping radii for quadrupole plus dipole and octupole plus dipole fields as given in the figures depicting the simulations of long , romanova & lovelace 2007 , 2008 and long , romanova & lamb 2011 .",
    "the agreement with the simulation results is comparable for both models , of order 40% for the quadrupole + dipole case and within a factor of two for the octupole + dipole case .",
    "this a satisfactory level of agreement , noting that we have neglected the angular dependence and dependence on relative orientation of the multipole axes .",
    "as the simulations do not indicate one model over the other we shall pursue the model taking into account the accretion flow .    what are the characteristic frequencies in the accretion flow ?",
    "the rotation rate of any rotating fluid plays a fundamental role in setting the frequency scales in dispersion relations .",
    "the rotation rate is keplerean in the far side of the accretion flow , and approaches the star s rotation rate as the flow approaches the star following closed corotating field lines",
    ". the actual local rotation rate in the transition region will start with being keplerean and may remain commensurate with the local keplerean frequencies .",
    "furthermore , as the matter loads onto magnetic field lines and falls toward the star , it will have velocities close to free - fall velocities , also of the order of the local keplerean velocities .",
    "the local kepler frequency is thus the basic frequency scale in the accretion flow .",
    "this can be seen in the rotation rates obtained from simulations .",
    "for example figure10 of long , romanova and lovelace ( 2007 ) , colour coded for rotation rates in dimensionless form , indicates rotation rates close to local keplerean values in high density accretion pockets beyond stopping radii .",
    "the dispersion in free fall and kepler velocities in these accretion pockets will lead to broad quasiperiodic frequency bands . to explain the quality of well defined qpo features the rotation rate @xmath17",
    "will be required to be modelled as it changes from keplerian behaviour to co - rotation through the transition layer .",
    "the rotation rate in the accretion flow and related mode frequencies like the epicyclic frequency are expected to go through maxima as a function of position in the transition layer ( alpar & psaltis 2008 , erkut , psaltis & alpar 2008 ) .",
    "if these modes can be excited near the location that has maximum mode frequency , the shear @xmath49 in the rotation rate and hence the dispersion in the mode frequencies will be minimal and well defined qpo signals may be imprinted on the accretion flow .",
    "the kepler frequency at the conventional ( dipole ) alfven radius should be comparable to the star s rotation rate if the system is close to rotational equilibrium . the kepler frequencies at the generalized alfven radii for higher multipoles are higher than the kepler frequency at the dipole alfven radius , with the ratios @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the break - up frequency of the neutron star .",
    "the relative strengths of the multipole fields on the neutron star surface can be obtained by taking the star to be in rotational equilibrium with the disk at the dipole alfven radius so that @xmath52 and the observed qpo frequencies are interpreted as @xmath53 . inverting eq.(14 ) gives : @xmath54 + the characteristic frequencies in accretion pockets above the generalized alfven radii can be much higher than the local kepler frequencies . as pointed out by alpar & psaltis ( 2008 ) for the boundary regions at the inner edge of an accretion disk , the radial epicyclic frequency @xmath55^{1/2}\\ ] ] can be quiet different from the kepler frequency .",
    "the rotation rate @xmath17 deviates from the keplerian rotation rate in a boundary or transition region between the disk and the magnetosphere corotating with the star . in the case of an accretion disk rotating",
    "faster than the neutron star and magnetosphere , @xmath17 increases from @xmath56 to @xmath57 through the transition region at the dipole alfven radius .",
    "the epicyclic frequency @xmath58 is then greater than @xmath17 and greater than even @xmath57 .",
    "such sources will be spinning up though they may be close to equilibrium , as expected for the low mass x - ray binaries . for sources rotating faster than the accretion disk at the dipole alfven radius ( sources in spin - down , like the sgr if these are acreting from fallback disks ) eq .",
    "( 17 ) leads to epicyclic frequencies less than the keplerian frequency at the dipole alfven radius .",
    "however , the situation near the stopping radius for a higher multipole component will always lead to epicyclic frequencies larger than the corresponding kepler frequencies : matter is corotating with the star at the rate @xmath56 near the inner surface of the transition region while further out above the stopping radius the transition regions ( accretion tongues or pockets ) support velocities close to the local keplerian values at @xmath59 , which in turn are higher than the keplerian velocities in the disk beyond the conventional dipole alfven radius @xmath60 .",
    "actual frequencies of oscillation modes within an accretion pocket are related to kepler frequencies in a way that incorporates the various magnetic or viscous forces , which may be represented by expressions involving the rotation rate and its derivatives as well as sonic and alfvenic terms ( erkut , psaltis & alpar 2008 ) . between the stopping radius for multipole @xmath22 and the outer surface of the accretion pocket , where the rotation rate is approximately keplerian , there is a steep gradient of the local rotation rate . from eq .",
    "( 17 ) we obtain the approximate expression for the radial epicyclic frequency @xmath61 where we have used @xmath62 , for systems close to rotational equilibrium .",
    "similar arguments can be made for spherical accretion .",
    "for spherical flows free - fall frequencies , which are of the same order as keplerian frequencies set the scale . the geometry of the magnetic field breaks the symmetry , and forms accretion pockets above the multipole stopping radii .",
    "the azimuthal and epicyclic frequencies within the boundary regions should then scale as discussed above .",
    "the generality of these arguments is reflected in the factors @xmath36 in eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) .",

    "a further effect towards producing high frequencies arises due to the presence of epicyclic ( radial ) modes in each of the accretion pockets above the generalized alfven radii ( eqs .",

    "the post - burst accretion flows in sgrs are candidates for the detection of high frequency qpos from slow rotators in a state of high luminosity . during the burst tail , with still high luminosities partly due to accretion ,",
    "the accretion flow disrupted by the burst would be re - adapting to the magnetospheric structure with its multipoles and characteristic frequencies .",
    "the x - ray bursters testify to the possibility of accretion flows in the presence of high luminosity ( super - eddington ) bursts . in table 1",
    "the high qpo frequencies observed from the sgrs 1806 - 20 and 1900 + 14 are evaluated as the keplerian and epicyclic frequencies at the multipole alfven radii in the accretion flow onto a magnetar close to rotational equilibrium but rotating slower than the fallback disk at the conventional @xmath0 alfven radius .",
    "the kepler frequencies at the multipole stopping radii are substantially higher than the stellar rotation rate , and the epicyclic frequencies can therefore be even larger . the sequence of frequencies is first evaluated with the simplest interpretation , associating the frequencies in increasing order with @xmath96 for @xmath88 . the ratios of the surface values for multipole fields to the surface dipole field , listed in the column labeled @xmath89 , are found to be @xmath97 10@xmath98 or less , contrary to the expectation of the fallback disk model , and findings in the source sgr 0418 + 5729 . if we now assume that multipole fields are 100 times as strong as the dipole field on the neutron star surface , and that the observed qpo frequencies correspond to epicyclic frequencies , the factors @xmath91 defined in eq(18 ) turn out to have values in the 10 - 100 range , implying thin boundary layers , with @xmath99 .",
    "if sgrs are indeed accreting from fallback disks , the high frequency burst tail oscillations can be explained as epicyclic frequencies associated with multipole magnetar fields .",

    "<S> when an accreting star is close to rotational equilibrium between the dipole component of the stellar magnetic field and the accretion disk , the star s rotation rate is roughly of the order of the keplerean rotation rate at the inner boundary of the disk , estimated as the conventional alfven radius . </S>",
    "<S> a range of frequencies higher than this equilibrium rotation frequency can naturally arise if the accretion flow is channeled by higher multipoles of the star s magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the higher multipole components of the magnetic field will balance the material stresses of the accretion flow at radii closer to the star . </S>",
    "<S> the kepler frequencies associated with these generalized alfven radii increase with the order of the multipole . </S>",
    "<S> other frequency bands , like the epicyclic frequencies associated with the accretion flow , may in turn be higher than the kepler frequencies . </S>",
