    "graphene , a two dimensional crystal of carbon atoms that has been recently experimentally realized @xcite , has highly unusual electronic properties .",
    "the lattice in graphene has a honeycomb shape and the corresponding energy bands intersect at two points , close to which the effective dispersion relation is approximately conical and similar to a  relativistic \" one .",
    "the low energy excitations of the half - filled system consist of hole - particle pairs created close to the tips of these two cones .",
    "these quasi - particles behave like two - dimensional ( 2d ) massless dirac fermions : for this reason the infrared ( ir ) properties of the system can be understood in terms of a model of 2d dirac particles in the continuum @xcite . as a result , a number of concepts and features of high energy physics have a correspondence and can be observed at much lower energies in this crystal .",
    "the description in terms of dirac fermions is quite accurate in the free case , and it is also helpful in the presence of many - body interactions ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) , as it allows to translate and adopt a number of powerful methods from the realm of quantum field theory ( qft ) to that of graphene .",
    "however , taking the effective description too seriously has some drawbacks , since a model of interacting 2d dirac fermions in the continuum has spurious _ ultraviolet divergences _ due to the linear bands . in order to make the continuum theory",
    "well - defined , ad hoc _ regularizations _ must be introduced to cure the short distance singularities , which are obviously absent in the tight binding model , where the honeycomb lattice acts naturally as an ultraviolet ( uv ) cut - off .",
    "it is unfortunate that the computation within the dirac model of certain physical observables , such as the conductivity , is sensitive to the specific choice of the regularization scheme , a fact that makes the comparison with experiments difficult or inaccurate , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "these ambiguities make an approximation - free analysis of the effects of the lattice and of the non - linear bands in graphene highly desirable . in this paper , we study a lattice gauge model for graphene that describes electrons hopping on the honeycomb lattice and weakly interacting with a three - dimensional ( 3d ) quantum @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "our model has two independent parameters : the bare fermi velocity @xmath1 and the electric charge @xmath2 ( we use units such that the reduced planck constant @xmath3 and the speed of light @xmath4 are equal to 1 ) .",
    "the analysis is performed by using exact renormalization group ( rg ) methods , which allow us to express the physical observables in terms of renormalized expansions in the electric charge with _",
    "finite _ coefficients at all orders , uniformly in the volume and in the temperature ( more precisely , we show that the coefficient multiplying @xmath5 in the renormalized expansion grows at most as @xmath6 ) .",
    "our main physical predictions are the following .    1 .",
    "thanks to the validity of exact lattice _",
    "ward identities _ , the gauge field remains massless and the ir behavior of the system is characterized by a _ line of fixed points _",
    "( i.e. , the effective charge has vanishing beta function ) .",
    "correspondingly , the physical parameters are strongly renormalized by the interaction . in particular , _ the fermi velocity increases up to the speed of light _ and lorentz invariance spontaneously emerges in the infrared .",
    "this is proved by fully taking into account the discrete lattice symmetries , which are used to exclude the presence of dangerous extra marginal or relevant terms in the rg flow .",
    "the wave function renormalization diverges at the fermi points with an anomalous exponent_. this last properties strongly resembles one of the crucial features of one - dimensional _ luttinger liquids _ ; in this sense , the model considered in this paper is one of the very few established examples of luttinger liquid behavior in _ two _ dimensions ( it has been suggested that also the hubbard model on the square lattice close to half filling is a luttinger liquid , but this is still an unproven fact ) .",
    "the response functions have an _ anomalous behavior _ expressed in terms of non trivial scaling exponents .",
    "the difference between the interacting and non - interacting exponents is small at small coupling . in particular , the response functions associated to fermionic bilinears ,",
    "which decay as @xmath7 at large distances in the non - interacting case , remain integrable even in the presence of weak interactions ; therefore , magnetic , phonon or superconducting susceptibilities are finite and _ no evidence for quantum instabilities _ is found , in agreement with the fact that the fixed point is close to the trivial one at weak coupling .",
    "4 .   on the other hand",
    ", the interaction removes the degeneracy in the decay exponents of the response functions : some exponent increase and some other decrease and this depresses or enhances the effects of local perturbations associated to specific fermionic bilinears .",
    "this gives us a criterium to extrapolate the qualitative behavior of the system at larger values of the electric charge and decide what are the favorite _ quantum instabilities at intermediate to strong coupling_. an explicit computation of the anomalous exponents shows that the _ dominant excitations _ correspond to : ( i ) _ kekul distortions _ , associated to a dimerized peierls pattern , ( ii ) _ charge - density waves _ associated to an excess / deficit of the electron density on the two sublattices of the honeycomb lattice , ( iii ) _ nel antiferromagnetism _ , ( iv ) the _ haldane circulating currents _ @xcite . in all these cases , the logarithmic singularity at zero transferred momentum in the first derivative of the response function in momentum space",
    "is changed into a power law singularity with an anomalous exponent .",
    "the singularity in the other responses is either absent or weaker than in the four cases mentioned above .",
    "if we add a symmetry breaking field coupled to a kekul distortion the induced energy gap in the spectrum is dramatically amplified by the interaction : the ratio between the energy gap and the amplitude @xmath8 of the external field diverges as @xmath9 with an anomalous power law . 6 .",
    "the effect of the electronic repulsion on the peierls - kekul instability , usually neglected , is evaluated by deriving an exact non - bcs gap equation , from which evidence is found that the gauge interaction facilitates the spontaneous distortion of the lattice and the gap generation .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn for the mass terms corresponding to the other dominant excitations .",
    "the exact wilsonian rg methods we use are based on ideas borrowed from constructive qft and have been introduced in the context of interacting fermi systems in @xcite ( and then extended in @xcite ) at the beginning of the 90s , and since then successfully applied to various problems in solid state physics , see , e.g. , @xcite for an updated review . in particular",
    ", they appear to be very well suited to analyze the properties of graphene without any dirac approximation , large - n approximations or unphysical regularization schemes .",
    "such methods have been first applied in @xcite to the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice , where we proved in a full _ non - perturbative _ fashion the analyticity of the ground state of the half - filled system ; we used the same methods to rigorously establish the universality of the optical conductivity of graphene with weak short range interactions @xcite , an issue that still needs to be fully understood in the case of electromagnetic interactions .",
    "technically , the analysis in this paper extends the one in @xcite , the main differences being that here we fully exploit the lattice symmetries and , besides computing the reduced density matrices , we construct the response functions , we compute the critical exponents and discuss the effects of external symmetry breaking fields . most of the results in this paper were announced in @xcite .",
    "let us add a comment on the range of applicability of our theory .",
    "our analysis is based on resummations of perturbation theory in @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the effective fine structure constant of graphene , which unfortunately is not small : e.g. , in suspended graphene , @xmath12 , which makes graphene an intrinsically _ strongly coupled _ problem , apriori not accessible to approaches based on power series expansions .",
    "however , one needs to take into account that the effective fermi velocity is considerably increased by the interactions ( recent experiments @xcite can observe a factor three amplification of the velocity close to the fermi points and even a larger enhancement is expected at lower energies ) , an effect that goes in the direction of decreasing the effective fine structure constant .",
    "therefore , our theory is valid close to the ir fixed point , with effective parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( @xmath1 close to the speed of light ) that should be thought as being obtained by the ( non - perturbative ) integration of the `` first few ir scales '' , possibly by using numerical methods , like those of @xcite .",
    "let us also remark that since we predict the emergence of anomalous critical exponents , our final results can be easily extrapolated to intermediate coupling , which would not be the case if the apparent logarithmic divergences emerging in perturbation theory were not correctly resummed at all orders .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we define the model , we present in detail our main results and compare them with existing literature . in sections [ sec2.2 ] to [ appc ]",
    "we discuss the proof of our results : in section [ sec2.2 ] we discuss the functional integral representation of our model and derive the relevant ward identities ( wis ) ; in section [ sec3 ] we describe our rg scheme to compute the functional integral ; in section [ secwi ] we show how to use wis to prove the vanishing of the photon mass , the vanishing of the beta function for the effective charge , and how to control the flow of the renormalization parameters ( fermi velocity , wave function renormalization , vertex functions ) ; in sections [ sec3ac ] and [ secoth ] we compute the response functions associated to several fermionic bilinears ; in sections [ seckek ] and [ appc ] we explain how to modify the general rg scheme to include the effects of an external field coupled to local order parameters and how to derive the non - bcs equation for the gap .",
    "a number of more technical aspects of the proof are deferred to the appendices : in appendix [ app1b ] we derive the functional integral representation , we derive the wis and we explicitly show the equivalence between the feynman and coulomb gauges ; in appendices [ app1 ] and [ app3 ] we analyze the symmetry properties of the theory and use them to identify the symmetry structure of the relevant and marginal kernels ; in appendix [ app2d ] we perform the lowest order computations of the beta function and of the critical exponents ; finally , for completeness , in appendix [ wicheck ] we check at lowest order the cancellation of the photon mass and of the charge beta function , which follows from the general gauge invariance of the model .",

    "the photon uv cutoff is chosen to be on the same scale as the inverse lattice spacing .",
    "we expect that this cutoff should be removable , but this is not our main concern here .",
    "the interacting electron - photon system we are interested in is described at half filling and in the coulomb gauge by the following grandcanonical hamiltonian : h_ = h^h_ + h^f_ + v_,[1.7 ] where the first term is the ( gauge - invariant ) hopping term , the second represents the field energy , and the third is the coulomb interaction , namely : h^h_&= & -t _ _ = ( e^ie_0 ^ 1dsa(x+s_j,0)_j a^+_x , b^-_x+_j , + e^-ie_0 ^ 1dsa(x+s_j,0)_j b^+_x + _ j , a^-_x,),[1.8 ] + h^f_ & = & _ |p| c^+_p , rc^-_p , r , v_ = _ x , y_a_b ( n_x - 1 ) ( x - y ) ( n_y - 1 ) , where @xmath55 is the hopping strength , @xmath2 is the electric charge , and @xmath56 is equal to @xmath57 or to @xmath58 depending on whether @xmath59 , respectively ; moreover , @xmath60 is a regularized periodic version of the 3d coulomb potential : ( x ) = _ p|_l , l e^-i px,[1.6 ] where we remind the reader that @xmath61 .",
    "note that the electron - photon interaction is induced both by the complex hopping rate @xmath62 in @xmath63 and by the static coulomb interaction @xmath64 ; the combination of the two describes the retarded electromagnetic interaction mediated by 3d photons",

    "therefore , interacting graphene at low energies is similar to a gas of massless 2d dirac particles interacting via a modified @xmath96 photon propagator .",
    "our goal is to understand the behavior of the system in the presence of a non - zero electron - photon coupling .",
    "we will be mainly concerned with the computation of the interacting correlations , in particular of the interacting electronic propagator and response functions .",

    "the corresponding response functions are defined as : r^(a)_ij(-)== _ _ l_,l,[res1]where the semicolon in @xmath100 indicates truncated expectation : @xmath101 .",
    "from the long distance behavior of @xmath102 we can read the possible emergence of long range order .",
    "for instance , if the lattice distortion response function behaved as @xmath103 for some @xmath104 asymptotically as @xmath105 , this would signal the spontaneous emergence of a peierls instability in the form of the dimerized kekul pattern of fig.[kcaf]a , which is one of the possible distortion patterns of graphene @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath106 is the local order parameter coupled in the hamiltonian to the hopping strength , whose mean value heuristically represents the intensity of the hopping from a given site to its nearest neighbor . having @xmath104 means that far away bonds are strongly correlated and that the joint distribution of their hopping rates is non uniform , but rather oscillating with a cosine dependence .",
    "with reference to fig.[kcaf]a , this oscillation can be heuristically understood by associating a factor proportional to @xmath51 ( to @xmath107 ) to the double ( single ) bonds and by averaging over the three equiprobable configurations obtained by rotating fig.[kcaf]a by @xmath108 . in momentum space",
    ", this would correspond to the appearance of a delta singularity ( i.e. , of a  condensate \" ) in @xmath109 at @xmath110 .",
    "similarly , a condensate in the @xmath111 mode of @xmath112 , @xmath113 or @xmath114 would signal the spontaneous emergence of a staggered density pattern ( _ charge density wave _ ) , of a staggered magnetization pattern ( _ nel order _ ) as in fig.[kcaf]b and fig.[kcaf]c , respectively , or of the specific pattern of circulating currents discussed in @xcite . even in the absence of condensation , that is of delta - like singularities in @xmath115 ,",
    "the possible loss of regularity in @xmath116 due to the interaction can be interpreted as a tendency of the system to develop quasi - long range order in the corresponding channel .",
    "the _ kekul ' e distortion _ ; the double and single bonds correspond to higher and smaller hopping rates , respectively .",
    "@xmath117 the _ charge density wave instability _ ; big dots correspond to a charge excess , while small dots correspond to a charge deficit . @xmath118",
    "the _ antiferromagnetic instability _ ; the arrows represent the spins of the electrons , and they have to be understood as lying on the axis orthogonal to the honeycomb lattice . ]",
    "we are now ready to state our main results .",
    "as shown in the following , after systematic resummations of perturbation theory , we are able to express the observables of our theory as renormalized series in the electric charge , with finite ( and explicitly bounded ) coefficients at all orders ; the coefficient of @xmath5 grows at most as @xmath6 , a behavior compatible with borel summability of the theory at weak enough coupling strength .",
    "in particular , in the limit @xmath119 , the interacting two - point function in the feynman gauge ( see section [ sec2.2 ] ) is given by : & & s()==_-^ _ e^-is ( ) , + & & s( + _ f^ ) = -    i k_0 & v()(-i k_1 + k_2 ) + v()(i k_1 + k_2 ) & i k_0    ^-1(1 + b())[res1z ] where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the interacting wave function renormalization and fermi velocity , while @xmath122 is a subdominant term , vanishing at the fermi points @xmath123 .",
    "the interacting propagator close to the fermi points has a structure very reminiscent of the free propagator , eq.([free5 ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are _ strongly renormalized _ by the interaction : z( ) ||^-,1-v( ) ( 1 - v)||^,[zv]where = + o(e^4),= + o(e^4),[res2 ] are anomalous critical exponents , well defined at all orders in renormalized perturbation theory ( the @xmath124 remainders in eq.([res2 ] ) are written below in terms of a series in @xmath5 , with coefficients growing at most as @xmath6 ) .",
    "eqs.([res1z])-([res2 ] ) are very reminiscent of the ir behavior of the 2-point function of a luttinger liquid @xcite , and are consistent with results obtained in a model of interacting dirac fermions in the continuum @xcite .    on the contrary , the interacting 2-point function for the photon has the same ir singularity @xmath125 as the free case ; this means that the gauge field remains _ massless _ ( no screening ) .",
    "regarding the response functions associated to fermionic bilinears , we find that in general the interaction changes their decay exponents at large distances as compared to the non - interacting case , where all the responses decay as @xmath126 at large distances .",
    "the presence of the interaction makes these exponents non trivial functions of @xmath2 ( anomalous dimensions ) .",

    ". moreover , the correction terms @xmath130 are subdominant contributions , decaying at infinity faster than @xmath131 ; they include both the effects coming from the irrelevant terms in a rg sense and the effects proportional to @xmath132 ( see eq.([zv ] ) ) coming from the lorentz symmetry breaking terms . from eqs.([rk])([raf ] ) , we see that the decay of the interacting responses in the k , cdw , af , h channels is slower than the corresponding non - interacting functions ; i.e. , the responses to k , cdw , af , h are strongly enhanced by the interaction . on the contrary , all other responses decay at infinity faster than @xmath133 , i.e. , if @xmath134 ( and similar bounds are valid for other observables like the cooper pairs , see section [ secoth ] below )    can be naturally extrapolated to larger values of the electric charge , in which case they suggest that the lattice distortion , staggered density , staggered magnetic order and the  haldane circulating currents \" are the dominant quantum instabilities at intermediate to strong coupling strength .",
    "as we noticed , quantum instabilities are also signaled by divergences in the fourier transform of the response functions . even in the presence of non trivial exponent ,",
    "the power law decay remains integrable at weak coupling : therefore , no divergence is found in the fourier transform of the response function . on the other hand , _",
    "r^(k)_ij(+_f^)~||^-^(k)_r^(a)_ij()~||^-^(a ) , a = cdw , af , h , so that the singularity in the first derivative of the response functions in momentum space , which appeared as a discontinuity or at most as a logarithmic divergence in the non interacting case , is enhanced and turned into a power law singularity by the interaction for these four responses .",
    "the singularity at different momenta or for other response functions is either weaker or absent .",
    "also in this respect , _ the conclusion is that the system shows a tendency towards kekul , charge density wave , nel ordering _ or to the formation of the _ haldane gap_.      the enhancement of the response functions suggests that the effects of small external staggered fields coupled to the @xmath135 local order parameters are dramatically enhanced by the interactions .",
    "this is in fact the case .",
    "let us , for instance , add an external staggered field coupled to the lattice distortion local order parameter , with the same cosine dependence as the long distance decay of @xmath136 , see eq.([rk ] ) .",
    "physically , this can be interpreted as a fixed distortion of the lattice into a kekul pattern as in fig.[kcaf]a .",
    "in fact , if we allow distortions of the honeycomb lattice , the hopping becomes a function of the bond length @xmath137 that , for small deformations , can be approximated by the linear function @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the equilibrium length of the bonds and @xmath140 plays the role of a classical phonon field .",
    "if a kekul distortion of amplitude proportional to @xmath141 is present , then @xmath142 for some @xmath143 and the hamiltonian becomes h^_0_ = h_-_j=1,2,3 _ e^ip_f^(x-_j+_j_0)^k_x , j.[hd0 ] if the electron - photon coupling @xmath2 is equal to @xmath53 , then the fermionic 2-point function has a mass proportional to @xmath8 .",

    "that is , the kekul mass is strongly amplified by the interaction ( note that the ratio between the interacting and bare masses diverges with an anomalous exponent as @xmath9 ) .",
    "this phenomenon is very reminiscent of the spontaneous mass generation phenomenon in qft , the main difference being that while in a truly relativistic theory in the continuum the flow of the mass can be studied also in the uv region and the bare mass can be let to zero with the uv cutoff ( still keeping the same dressed mass at fixed ir scale ) , see @xcite , here the lattice acts as a fixed uv cut - off , so that the mass is amplified but not spontaneously generated .",
    "similar arguments can be repeated for the other dominant excitations .",
    "let us finally discuss a possible mechanism for the spontaneous generation of a kekul instability in our model .",

    "note the non bcs - like form of the gap , similar to the one appearing in certain luttinger superconductors @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis can be repeated for the gap generated by the staggered density , the magnetization or the haldane mass .",
    "before we enter the technical part of our work , let us conclude this expository section by a comparison of our model and our results with existing literature .",
    "we do not pretend to give a full account of the rapidly expanding literature on the effects of interactions in graphene ; several excellent reviews already exists , like @xcite , which we refer to for extensive bibliography .",
    "here we focus on the difference between the approaches and results based on the effective models of dirac gas in the continuum , which is the most popular and widely studied model of graphene , and ours , which is based on a tight binding lattice model .    _ short range interactions_. graphene with electron - electron screened interactions has been studied in terms of an effective model of 2d massless dirac fermions interacting with a local quartic potential : in the weak coupling regime this interaction is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense @xcite , while at strong coupling analyses based on large @xmath161 expansions found some evidence for quantum critical points @xcite .",
    "this model requires an uv regularization and some observables , like the conductivity , appear to be sensitive to the specific uv regularization scheme used : different results are found @xcite depending on whether momentum or dimensional regularizations is chosen .",
    "a more realistic model for graphene with short range interactions is a tight binding model that keeps into full account lattice effects , such as the half - filled _ hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice_. formally , the hubbard model reduces to the continuum dirac gas in the limit as the lattice spacing goes to zero ; in this sense the latter can be thought as a scaling limit approximation of the former .",
    "one important advantage of the lattice model",
    "as compared to the continuum one is that within the former no ambiguities arise in the computation of the conductivity . in particular , all the interaction correction to the conductivity _ exactly cancel out _ in the optical limit @xcite , in agreement with experimental results , @xcite , and in disagreement with the dirac model with momentum regularization .",
    "_ gauge - invariant electromagnetic interactions_. in the early paper @xcite ( written much before the actual realization of graphene ) an effective model for interacting of graphene was proposed , in which massless dirac fermions in the 2d continuum are coupled to a quantum 3d photon field , with the fermionic propagation speed much smaller than the speed of light .",
    "the main result of @xcite , based on second order perturbation theory ( and , therefore , valid in the weak coupling regime ) , is that at low energies the fermi velocity tends to the speed of light and the wave function renormalization diverges with an anomalous exponent .",
    "no computation of the response function exponents was performed .    in @xcite",
    ", we revisited the model proposed in @xcite and , rather than using dimensional regularization as in @xcite , we used an uv momentum cut - off ; this is a much more natural choice , since the dirac continuum model should be though of as an effective model emerging in a wilsonian rg after the integration of the high energy degrees of freedom . using this model , we extended the results in @xcite at all orders , but still we computed neither the response functions nor the gap equation .",
    "on the other hand , the momentum cutoffs , necessary to avoid spurious uv divergences , break gauge invariance and this imposed the introduction of counterterms in order to keep the photon mass vanishing and in order to have one ( rather than three ) effective charge @xcite .    in the more realistic model considered in this paper the electrons live on a honeycomb lattice and interact with a quantum photon field living in the 3d continuum .",
    "the fact that gauge invariance is not broken has the effect that no unphysical counterterms need to be introduced .",
    "the critical exponents and the gap equation have been computed here for the first time .",
    "moreover , lattice gauge invariance prevents the generation of several potentially dangerous marginal and relevant terms . as in the case of hubbard interactions , the conductivity computed in the continuum model show an unphysical dependence from the conductivity @xcite ,",
    "while considering the model and the formalism introduced in this model will resolve such ambiguities .",
    "_ static coulomb interactions . _",
    "the most popular model used to describe graphene with unscreened electromagnetic interactions is a dirac gas with static density - density coulomb interactions ; this is an apparently sensible approximation , since the ( bare ) propagation speed of quasi - particles in graphene is much smaller than the speed of light , so that retardation effects should be negligible at least in a wide range of energy scales .",
    "however , in the weak coupling regime , a second order rg analysis predicts an unbounded growth of the fermi velocity in the ir and the vanishing of the effective charge at the fermi points @xcite .",
    "therefore , at low energy scales the fermi velocity becomes comparable with the speed of light and the model with static interactions loses its significance , a fact that can be seen as a dramatic manifestation of its  uncompletness \" , see @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that the theory with static coulomb interactions does not appear to be renormalizable at all orders , see @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "retardation effects are important to understand the nature of the ir fixed point of the theory .",
    "the effective dirac model with coulomb interactions has been also extensively analyzed in the strong coupling regime .",
    "it has been argued that , at large enough coupling , an excitonic gap spontaneously opens @xcite , by a mechanism similar to mass generation in qed@xmath162 @xcite : in these works , the gap equation is derived by a self - consistence argument ; the corresponding solution is shown to be momentum - dependent and vanishing in the limit of high momenta .",
    "however , these findings rely on several approximations , in particular : in @xcite the vertex , wave function and velocity renormalizations are neglected ; in @xcite the renormalization of the velocity is taken into account , but the corresponding flow is ir - unbounded and uv - cutoff dependent . in our work ,",
    "the gap equation is obtained by using an _ exact _ energy optimization problem and fully takes into account the renormalization of all relevant and marginal operators ; moreover , since we do not neglect effects of the honeycomb lattice , our results are free from the ambiguities related to the presence of the spurious uv divergences typical of the dirac approximation .    in @xcite",
    "a systematic classifications of the possible interaction and mass terms allowed by symmetry is performed in the dirac model with coulomb interactions ; in the present paper a similar analysis is carried out , with the difference that the lattice discrete symmetries rather than the continuum symmetries are taken into account .",
    "rg analyses based on large @xmath161 expansions @xcite and quantum montecarlo analyses @xcite in the presence of coulomb interactions have identified critical exponents for the response functions and found evidence for the presence of excitonic phase transitions ( like cdw and kekul instabilities ) .",
    "again , these results are in qualitative agreement with our finding that the effective kekul mass ( or the cdw , af , h mass ) grows at low momenta with an anomalous power law , although the model and the method are quite different ( expansion in the charge and retarded interactions versus @xmath163 expansions and instantaneous interactions ) .",
    "a strong coupling expansion for a lattice gauge theory for graphene has been also performed in @xcite and evidence for spontaneous kekul mass generation was found .",
    "it is worth stressing that the lattice used for the quantum montecarlo analysis in @xcite is a _ square _ lattice , rather than the original _ honeycomb _ lattice ; it would be interesting to repeat a similar analysis for the more realistic honeycomb lattice gauge theory introduced in the present paper .",
    "let us finally note that the peierls - kekul instability was first discussed in the non - interacting case in @xcite , as a key ingredient for the emergence of electron fractionalization without the breaking of time - reversal symmetry ( on this issue , see also @xcite ) .",
