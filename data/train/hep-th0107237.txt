    "the yukawa model , describing a system of two fermions interacting by scalar exchange ( @xmath4 ) , is instructive for studying the relativistic bound states and for developing the renormalization methods .",
    "it is also a main ingredient in building the @xmath5 interaction , which contains an important contribution of scalar meson exchanges .",
    "the bound state problem and the renormalization in the yukawa model were studied @xcite in the framework of standard light - front dynamics @xcite .",
    "the relativistic two - nucleon wave functions have been also calculated perturbatively @xcite in the explicitly covariant version of light - front dynamics @xcite , where the state vector is defined on the invariant plane @xmath6{$\\cdot$}}x=0 $ ] with @xmath7 ( see for review @xcite ) . in this work ,",
    "the bonn @xmath5 model was used with the corresponding form factors @xcite and the problem of cut - off dependence was not analyzed .    in reference",
    "@xcite , we investigated the stability of the bound states relative to the high momentum contributions of the kernel , when the cutoff tends to infinity .",
    "below we present the results of our study and compare them with those obtained in @xcite .",
    "we consider the two fermion wave function with total angular momentum @xmath8 . in the fermion spin indices",
    ", it is a @xmath9 matrix determined , due to the parity conservation , by two independent elements  the spin components @xmath10 .",
    "since the wave function is defined on the light - front plane @xmath6{$\\cdot$}}x=0 $ ] , components @xmath11 depend not only on the relative momentum @xmath12 , but also on the angle @xmath13 between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the system of equations for @xmath16 contains a @xmath9 matrix kernel @xmath17 , calculated by using the explicitly covariant light - front graph techniques @xcite .",
    "these equations and the analytical expressions of kernels are given in @xcite .",
    "though their form differs from the ones used in @xcite , we have shown that they are strictly equivalent .",
    "let us consider the equations on the finite interval @xmath18 .",
    "the dependence of their solutions on the cutoff @xmath19 in the limit @xmath20 is determined by the kernels asymptotics .",
    "the kernel @xmath21 is repulsive and can not generate a collapse , whereas @xmath22 is attractive .",
    "therefore , to investigate the stability , we can consider the one channel problem for the component @xmath23 , which satisfies the equation : @xmath24 f_1(k,\\theta ) = \\frac{m^2}{2\\pi^3 } \\int k_{11}(k,\\theta;k',\\theta')f_1(k',\\theta')\\frac{d^3k'}{\\varepsilon_{k'}},\\ ] ] where @xmath25 .",
    "our analysis uses the fact that at @xmath26 the integral in the r.h.s . of ( [ as2_0 ] )",
    "is dominated by the region @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 with a fixed ratio @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "one can therefore replace in ( [ as2_0 ] ) both wave function and kernel by their asymptotics , which have the form @xcite : @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . by setting @xmath35 and @xmath36 in ( [ eqn16 ] ) ,",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath22 becomes identical to asymptotics of the momentum space kernel corresponding to the non - relativistic potential @xmath37 .",
    "as it is well known @xcite , there exists for this potential a critical coupling constant @xmath38 , that corresponds to @xmath39 .",
    "the inspection of ( [ eq14a ] ) shows that in the yukawa model the function @xmath40 is smaller than for the @xmath37 potential : @xmath41 .",
    "therefore in this model , one can expect a larger critical coupling constant i.e. @xmath42 , what is confirmed by numerical calculations .    substituting ( [ eqn16 ] ) into equation ( [ as2_0 ] ) , we obtain for @xmath43 @xcite : @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 equation ( [ ghg ] ) is an eigenvalue equation for @xmath47 , parametrized by @xmath48 .",
    "it provides the relation between the coupling constant @xmath2 and @xmath48 , determining the power law ( [ eqn16 ] ) of the wave function asymptotics . the r.h.s .",
    "of equation ( [ as2_0 ] ) becomes divergent for @xmath49 .",
    "hence , the equation @xmath50 determines the critical coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "in the numerical calculations , the constituent masses were taken equal to @xmath51=1 and the mass of the exchanged scalar is @xmath52=0.25 .",
    "the numerical solution @xmath53 , found from equation ( [ ghg ] ) with the function @xmath54 given by ( [ eq14a ] ) , is plotted in figure [ alpha_beta ] .",
    "the critical coupling constant is obtained for @xmath55 for which the eigenvalue is @xmath56 .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath57 , as shown in figure [ alpha_beta ] at @xmath55 .    in figure",
    "[ b_kmax ] , we have plotted the mass square @xmath58 of the two fermion system , found from ( [ as2_0 ] ) , as a function of the cutoff @xmath19 for two fixed values of the coupling constant below and above the critical value @xmath59 .",
    "one can see two dramatically different behaviors depending on the value of the coupling constant @xmath2 . for @xmath60 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath61 , the result is convergent . on the contrary , for @xmath62",
    ", i.e. @xmath63 , the result is clearly divergent : @xmath58 decreases logarithmically as a function of @xmath19 and becomes even negative . though the negative values of @xmath58 are physically meaningless , they are formally allowed by equations .",
    "the first degree of @xmath64 does not enter neither in the equation nor in the kernel , and @xmath58 crosses zero without any singularity .",
    "we have examined the asymptotical behavior of the wave function @xmath65 and found that it very accurately follows the power law ( [ eqn16 ] ) with the power @xmath66 given in figure [ alpha_beta ] .",
    "for instance for a binding energy @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) a direct measurement in the numerical solution plotted in figure [ wf_as_50 ] gives @xmath69 whereas the solution of equation ( [ ghg ] ) for the corresponding @xmath2 gives @xmath70 .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath74  or @xmath75 state in the classification @xcite  is stable ( i.e. convergent relative to the cutoff @xmath20 ) for coupling constant @xmath2 below the critical value @xmath59 . in this point ,",
    "our conclusion differs from the one settled in @xcite , where it was stated that the integrals in the r.h.s . of",
    "the equations diverge logarithmically with cutoff . above the critical value",
    "the integrals indeed diverge and the system collapses .",
    "thus , by an analytical method , confirmed by numerical calculations , we have shown that the yukawa model is not cutoff dependent for coupling constant below a critical value .",
    "the results obtained should be taken into account for instance in the renormalization procedures . @xmath77    99 glazek , st . ,",
