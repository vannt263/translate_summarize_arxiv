    "<S> we find that it strongly depends on the @xmath4 limit or the unique gauge coupling to the quarks , whether the @xmath5 decay , which is from the @xmath2-boson annihilation , is suppressed by @xmath6 ; however , no such suppression is found via the loop - induced @xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> a light gauge boson @xmath0 has been studied widely due to various motivations  @xcite . especially , a mass of around 17 mev boson with more than @xmath8 significance is indicated by the measurement of @xmath9 angular correlations in @xmath10 transition  @xcite , where the implications of this light gauge boson are investigated  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , contradictory conclusions associated with the @xmath0 emission in rare @xmath11 decay occur in the literature , where the authors  @xcite concluded that the longitudinal component in the @xmath5 decay is enhanced by @xmath12 , but the authors @xcite claimed that this decay amplitude should be suppressed by @xmath13 . in this study </S>",
    "<S> , we revisit this issue by exploring the situations with and without the @xmath4 limit and unique gauge coupling , when the @xmath14 transition arises from the @xmath2-boson annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also study the contributions from the loop - induced flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> since our purpose is to investigate the property of a light gauge boson emission from @xmath14 transition , we do not focus on a specific gauge model . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we study the case that the @xmath0-boson vectorially couples to the standard model ( sm ) quarks and the interactions are dictated by : @xmath15 in general , the couplings @xmath16 are flavor dependence , and the fcncs at the tree level are then induced . </S>",
    "<S> since we have less knowledge on the flavor mixings , the associated fcnc parameters are completely free ; therefore , we skip the discussions on the tree - level fcnc effects in this work by assuming that they are small , or they can be always constrained by the low energy physics . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : lx ] ) can be applied to dark photon models if @xmath16 for the same type of quarks are the same  @xcite . in order to demonstrate the characteristics of the @xmath5 decay </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the hadronic effects with leading - twist parton distribution amplitudes ( das ) for the @xmath17 and @xmath11 mesons . as usual , the twist-2 da of a pseudoscalar meson is defined by @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the decay constant of a meson @xmath22 . </S>",

    "<S> it can be seen that due to the su(3 ) breaking , the odd moments in the @xmath11 meson do not vanish . to calculate the @xmath0 emission from the @xmath11 and @xmath17 mesons , we adopt the spin structure for incoming meson as  @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of colors ; and the spin structure for outgoing meson can be obtained by using @xmath33 instead of @xmath34 . according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : da ] ) , the @xmath21 can be obtained by taking the trace in spinor space as : @xmath35 where the @xmath36 in the numerator is from the sum of color charges of quark line @xmath37 q_{1\\alpha}$ ] .     </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : lx ] ) , the @xmath5 decay can arise from the tree and one - loop diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> since the hadronic effects from the tree level are more copious than those from one - loop , we first discuss the tree contributions in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the flavor diagrams for the @xmath1 decay are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kpix ] , where the square boxes and numbers denote the possible places to emit the @xmath0-boson . according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : da ] ) , the decay amplitude for the @xmath0-boson emitting from place-1 can be derived as : @xmath38 it is found that the decay amplitude for the @xmath0-boson emitting from place-@xmath39 can be formulated as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are defined as : @xmath48 in order to understand the @xmath4 limit and @xmath16 dependence of @xmath49 , we study the cases by requiring exact / partial @xmath4 limit and different / same @xmath16 .    : </S>",
    "<S> + since @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the multiplier factors , they are irrelevant to the discussions of @xmath4 limit ; therefore , we do not need to set @xmath52 . due to the kinematics </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath53 has to be satisfied ; thus , we need to leave the factors @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which appear in the denominators of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : a_j ] ) and ( [ eq : r_j ] ) , we then get : @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath58 because the @xmath59 and @xmath60 involve the same gauge coupling @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> one can alternatively use @xmath62 depending on the convenience . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly seen that the decay amplitude for the @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this result can match the conclusions given in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that when calculating @xmath64 , we have used the property @xmath65 , where this condition is suitable for the @xmath17 meson , and it is violated in the @xmath11 meson due to the @xmath4 breaking . as a result , the leading - twist contributions can not lead to an interesting result in the @xmath4 limit . furthermore </S>",
    "<S> , if we further set @xmath66 , it can be found that @xmath67 .     </S>",
    "<S> + when we release the condition @xmath68 , the first term in the numerator of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : a1pa3 ] ) inside the integral becomes @xmath69 , and the denominator is @xmath70 . with @xmath71 , </S>",
    "<S> we find : @xmath72 where the @xmath73 dependence of numerator and denominator in the integral is cancelled , and @xmath74 is applied . by this analysis , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that when we put back the @xmath4 breaking effect with @xmath75 , the decay amplitude is not proportional to @xmath63 anymore . </S>",
    "<S> this result confirms the conclusions given in  @xcite . furthermore , if we take all gauge couplings to be the same and @xmath76 , we find that @xmath77 is still satisfied </S>",
    "<S> . we can understand the cancellations from another viewpoint : by using @xmath78 , from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : a_j ] ) and ( [ eq : r_j ] ) it can be easily found that @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> + with partial @xmath4 limit , which is conditioned by @xmath83 , we have seen that the decay amplitude for the @xmath5 is not suppressed by @xmath63 ; however , it diminishes when @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> it is intriguing to see whether the cancellations work or not when the @xmath4 breaking effects are taken into account in the da of the @xmath11 meson . from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : a_j ] ) and ( [ eq : r_j ] ) , we can easily get the result @xmath85 when the @xmath61 and @xmath73 in @xmath60 are replaced by the @xmath86 and @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> the connection between @xmath60 and @xmath88 is based on the property @xmath89 , where the odd gegenbauer moments vanish . </S>",
    "<S> that is , if @xmath90 , the cancellation between @xmath60 and @xmath88 still works . unlike the da of pion , @xmath91 due to nonvanishing odd gegenbauer moments , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , @xmath92 . hence , we have : @xmath93 \\label{eq : a1pa2}\\ ] ] in order to examine eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : a1pa2 ] ) , we simplify the analysis by taking the limit @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , with @xmath95 , we find : @xmath96 according to the result , it can be seen that the decay amplitude for the @xmath5 with @xmath97 is @xmath98 , where the function @xmath99 is from the integration in @xmath73 and only depends on the @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> we then conclude that if the @xmath0 gauge couplings to the quarks are the same , the decay amplitude of the @xmath5 process from the leading - twist da is suppressed by @xmath100 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is of interest to examine the @xmath0 emission from @xmath2-boson propagator shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kpix ] . to estimate the contribution , we parametrize the lorentz covariant gauge coupling @xmath101 to be : @xmath102 w^{-\\alpha } w^{+\\beta}x^\\mu\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the trilinear gauge coupling ; @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are the momenta of @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath0 gauge bosons , respectively , and the momenta are chosen to flow into the vertex . accordingly , the decay amplitude for the @xmath5 via the trilinear coupling can be obtained as : @xmath109 it is clear that the contribution from the coupling @xmath101 is suppressed by @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is nothing to do with the @xmath4 limit .    without the @xmath4 limit </S>",
    "<S> , it can be seen from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : r_j ] ) that the numerators of @xmath110 are related to @xmath111 and those of @xmath112 are associated with @xmath113 . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath118 is sensitive to the difference between @xmath86 and @xmath61 . to present the numerical analysis </S>",
