    "in this paper , we consider the situation in which an irreducible subfactor @xmath10 has an intermediate subfactor @xmath11 ; and work out a reformulation of the proof of the fact that the planar algebra @xmath12 may be derived from @xmath13 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) by requiring that the action of a planar tangle @xmath4 is given by equation ( [ alpheq ] ) below .",
    "it is well - known from earlier work of bisch @xcite - and reformulated in @xcite and @xcite in the planar algebraic terms that we will actually use here - that such intermediate subfactors are in bijective correspondence with so - called _ biprojections _ say @xmath14 .",
    "we wish here to describe ( in theorem  [ main1 ] ) the planar algebra of @xmath15 in terms of the planar algebra of @xmath10 , while the planar algebra of @xmath8 can be obtained by applying these results to @xmath9 .",
    "the biprojection @xmath16 corresponding to the intermediate subfactor @xmath11 gives rise naturally to a mapping @xmath17 from tangles of any colour ( say @xmath18 ) to partially labelled tangles of the same colour ( see definition [ deff ] ) , and a scalar - valued function @xmath19 defined on the collection of all tangles ( see definition [ defalpha ] ) , such that @xmath20 may be identified with a planar algebra , call it @xmath21 , with @xmath22,where @xmath23 is the identity tangle of colour @xmath24 and the multilinear map @xmath25 associated to a tangle @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 where both sides are thought of as acting on @xmath28 . the slightly involved proof of the above assertion takes some work - see theorem [ main ] and theorem [ main1 ] .",
    "the difference in proofs here and in @xcite stems from the two ways that a planar algebra @xmath29 can be described , respectively , ( i ) as in @xcite ( where one says what the underlying spaces @xmath30 are , and explicitly describes the multilinear operator @xmath31 associated to a planar tangle @xmath4 , and then verifying that these tangle maps satisfy the necessary compatibility conditions , as in theorem [ main1 ] ) , and ( ii ) by specifying a non - degenerate scalar - valued partition function @xmath32 on @xmath33-tangles ( labelled by @xmath34 ) which is invariant under planar isotopy and multiplicative on connected components ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , one may say that a ` bonus ' in our approach is that we know how any planar tangle acts on a vector in its domain .    with our formulation of intermediate planar algebra , as an application , in section [ cpe ] we have recovered the result of @xcite which establishes an one - one correspondence between a planar subalgebra @xmath35 of the ` group planar algebra ' which is naturally associated with a group @xmath36 of automorphisms of the given group @xmath37 and the planar agebra corresponding to the ` subgroup - subfactor ' associated with the inclusion @xmath38 .",
    "it seems that there is a slight inaccuracy with the constant in the defining isomorphism @xmath39 of @xcite , while the corrected constant may be found in definition [ defi ] .    in an appendix ,",
    "we have described the tower of iterated basic construction of @xmath40 in terms of the the corresponding tower of @xmath41 .",
    "this is the crucial step in obtaining standard invariant of @xmath42 in terms of @xmath43 .",
    "the jones tower of @xmath42 in terms of @xmath43 was described in @xcite . here",
    "we give another proof using yet another characterization of the basic construction , in terms of pimsner popa bases .",
