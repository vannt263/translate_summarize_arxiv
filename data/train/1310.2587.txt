    "for example , upon doping with co for fe in ba(fe@xmath11co@xmath12)@xmath7as@xmath7 , both the structural and afm order are suppressed to lower temperatures and split , with the structural transition found at a slightly higher temperature than the magnetic transition.@xcite sc emerges for co substitutions between @xmath13 = 0.03 and @xmath13 = 0.12 with superconducting transition temperatures ( @xmath14 ) up to @xmath1523  k. neutron diffraction studies have clearly established the coexistence of , and competition between , sc and afm order over a small range in co concentration.@xcite above @xmath13 @xmath15 0.06 , the afm order is completely suppressed , but correlated afm fluctuations are observed at * * q**@xmath9 .",

    "however , the proposed a - type afm order has not previously been confirmed via diffraction techniques and is surprising in light of the inelastic neutron scattering measurements in srco@xmath7as@xmath7 mentioned above which show stripe - like afm fluctuations.@xcite    here we report on our crystal and magnetic structure investigations of powders and single crystals of sn - flux grown @xmath0  by x - ray and neutron diffraction . the co - refined x - ray and neutron powder diffraction measurements confirm the essential elements of the structure determined previously.@xcite however , from two independent measurements , we show that there are 7(1)% vacancies on the co site , leading to a stoichiomentry of @xmath2 instead of the previously reported stoichiometry @xmath0 .",
    "we also report on the temperature dependence of the lattice constants which exhibit conventional behavior in contrast to the negative thermal expansion found previously for the _ c_-axis of srco@xmath7as@xmath7.@xcite our single - crystal magnetic neutron diffraction measurements are consistent with collinear a - type afm order , as suggested by cheng _",

    "diffraction data were obtained at temperatures of 295  k , 200  k , 100  k , 60  k and 20  k.    neutron powder diffraction data were collected at the spallation neutron source ( powgen ) at oak ridge national laboratory .",
    "a sample of mass 1.3  g was prepared by crushing single crystals and loaded into a vanadium sample can in the presence of he exchange gas to maintain thermal conductivity at low temperatures .",
    "data were collected at temperatures of 300  k and 10  k using center wavelengths of 1.333 and 4.797    which allowed the acquisition of diffraction patterns for @xmath31 spacings of 0.45 to 8.5   . to search for evidence of magnetic order at low temperature ,",
    "the longer - wavelength data at 10  k were collected for six times longer than for 300  k as the afm signal was expected to be weak because of the expected small ordered moment ( @xmath15 0.3  @xmath32/co).@xcite    single - crystal neutron diffraction measurements were performed on a 34  mg crystal using the triax triple - axis spectrometer at the university of missouri research reactor .",
