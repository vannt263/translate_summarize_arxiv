    "since the late 1990 s , the notion of @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians in quantum physics is addressed in many works after its first appearance in a publication of bender and boettcher @xcite concerning a conjecture of bessis and zinn - justin .    by dropping the requirement of hermiticity but of course keeping the invariance by the lorentz group ,",
    "one opens on a significantly larger class of hamiltonians satisfying a weaker hypothesis , namely the @xmath0-invariance .",
    "this more flexible condition amounts to the commutability of the hamiltonian @xmath2 and the composite operator @xmath0 whose components consist of one linear operator @xmath3 ( for _ parity _ ) and another anti - linear @xmath4 ( for _ time - reversal _ ) .    it has been showed that , despite the lack of hermiticity , many @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians still have a whole real and bounded from below discrete spectrum ( see @xcite ) . however , a controversy has merged among researchers due to the fact that the space of states may be no longer a hilbert space , at variance with traditional quantum mechanics .",
    "recently , many studies have been devoted to the establishment of a conventional mathematical structure for @xmath0-symmetry quantum mechanics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most important considerations is to equip the space of states associated with a given hamiltonian with a certain inner product , so suitably that the norm induced by this inner product is positive definite .    for hermitian hamiltonians on the real axis @xmath5 ,",
    "such a space is normally known as the hilbert space @xmath6 , whose inner product is nothing but the usual one .",
    "the norm induced from this actually positive definite inner product is interpreted as a probability density in the space of states .",
    "such an ideal model seems to be no longer available whenever the hamiltonians are non - hermitian .",
    "however , the specialists in the field have recently succeeded in constructing a consistent physical theory for _ unbroken _ @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians .",
    "the most essential aspect in their investigations is the appearance of a linear _  charge \" _ operator @xmath7 whose action enables the so - called @xmath0-pseudo - norm to switch its sign in a suitable way , so that the induced @xmath8-norm is now positive definite .",
    "this operator @xmath7 is nowdays a central subject of interest .",
    "recently , in an attempt to formulate @xmath0-symmetric quantum theories , bender _ et al _ have obtained many significant results through explicit calculation of the operator @xmath7 for some special @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians ( see @xcite ) . as a rule ,",
    "the construction relies on the observation of a so - called quasi - parity quantum number @xcite , so that the @xmath0-pseudo - norm exhibits a generic sign alternation , upon the eigenstates of hamiltonians .",
    "this paper , which is motivated by these observations , aims mainly to justify the indefiniteness of the @xmath0-inner product for a class of unbroken @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians . by using some classical results on stokes multipliers ( see @xcite , ch .",
    "@xmath9 ) , whose zeros are exactly the eigenvalues of the considered hamiltonians , we show an analytical relation between the @xmath0-pseudo - norm and the derivative with respect to the eigenparameter of one of these stokes multipliers , from which the sign alternation occurs as a natural consequence .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall some simple notions and facts on the sturm - liouville eigenvalue problem associated with a class of complex hamiltonians .",
    "a strong connection between our problem and sibuya s theory on linear differential equations is formulated for our next purposes .",
    "section 3 contains our main results which allow to establish a relationship between the @xmath0-pseudo - norm and the derivative in the eigenparameter of a convenient stokes multiplier .",
    "this gives a clear explanation for the indefiniteness of the @xmath0-pseudo - norm , thus justifying what has been observed in various works ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in the conclusion we suggest some further considerations and discuss a degenerate case , where the @xmath0-symmetry may be spontaneously broken by the vanishing of the @xmath0-pseudo - norm at some degenerate states .",
    "we consider a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the operator @xmath12 and @xmath13\\ ] ] is a polynomial of degree @xmath14 in the variable @xmath15 with _ real _ coefficients @xmath16 .",
    "these assumptions induce that the complex - valued potential function @xmath17 satisfies the following relation , @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 stands for the complex conjugate of @xmath20 ) , which is broadly known as the @xmath0-symmetry , or more geometrically as the invariance property of @xmath17 under the _ real _ conjugation .",
    "recall that , as usual , the combination @xmath0 stands for the composite operator of @xmath3 ( _ parity _ operator ) and @xmath4 ( _ time - reversal _ operator ) whose actions on the @xmath21-space are generally determined as follows : @xmath22    by definition , @xmath23 is not a linear but an anti - linear operator .",
    "its action on a wave function @xmath24 is simply given by @xmath25 consequently , a function @xmath24 is called @xmath0-_symmetric _ if it remains unchanged under the action of the operator @xmath0 in ( [ dncuapt ] ) .",

    ", we shall determine a space of functions on which the action of our given hamiltonian is meaningful .",
    "we note that the usual set of functions considered for most ( hermitian ) hamiltonians on the real line is @xmath6 , in relation to its useful hilbert space structure . in the context of non - hermitian hamiltonians , defining such a space with an appropriate algebraic structure has not been yet completely settled in general .",

    "precisely , it will be convenient to define @xmath38 by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( drawn on fig.[hinh3 ] ) are respectively the rays oriented from the origin to infinity such that @xmath49    we now introduce a sesquilinear form on @xmath30 as follows . for @xmath50",

    "<S> this paper presents an underlying analytical relationship between the @xmath0-pseudo - norm associated with the @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath1 and the stokes multiplier of the differential equation corresponding to this hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the sign alternation of @xmath0-pseudo - norm , which has been observed as a generic feature of the @xmath0-inner product , is essentially controlled by the derivative of stokes multiplier with respect to eigenparameter .    </S>",
