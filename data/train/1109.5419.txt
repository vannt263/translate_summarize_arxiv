    "one - dimensional chaotic dynamics are usualy characterized by the existence of a positive lyapunov exponent , which indicates exponential separation of initially nearby trajectories @xcite . in recent years , we have witnessed a rapid development in the study and characterization of dynamical unpredictable systems in which the separation of trajectories is weaker than exponential @xcite . for these systems ,",
    "generically dubbed weakly chaotic in the physical literature , the conventional lyapunov exponent vanishes and new concepts and ideas for the characterization of dynamical instabilities are necessary for a deeper understanding of their global dynamics .",
    "many results of infinite ergodic theory @xcite come out as powerful tools in this context , shedding light on several apparently unrelated results in the physical literature . among them , the aaronson - darling - kac ( adk ) theorem @xcite has certainly a central role in these problems .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to extend the well - known pesin relation @xcite for the case of weakly chaotic one - dimensional systems , a matter that has attracted considerable attention recently ( see @xcite for references ) and even some controversy @xcite . for usual one - dimensional chaotic systems ,",
    "the pesin relation is given simply by @xmath0 , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 standing , respectively , for the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy and the usual lyapunov exponent .",
    "we will show that adequate subexponential generalizations of the ks entropy and of the lyapunov exponent will obey exactly the same pesin - type relation , for almost all trajectories .",
    "it is important to stress that the existence of such generalization is far from intuitive since we are dealing with nonergodic systems for which the typical dynamical quantities do depend on the specific trajectory .",
    "we also show that the extension based on krengel entropy proposed in @xcite for weakly chaotic systems is incorrect .",
    "the source of the problem is identified and the correct expression is presented .",
    "we close by comparing our proposed pesin - type relation based on the subexponential ks entropy and the proposal involving the krengel entropy .",
    "we will consider here the general class of pomeau - manneville ( pm ) @xcite maps @xmath3 , with @xmath4\\to [ 0,1]$ ] such that @xmath5 for @xmath6 , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . from the physical point of view , the original pm system ( @xmath9 ) is paradigmatic since it corresponds to certain poincar sections related to the lorenz attractor @xcite .",
    "systems of the type ( [ pmap ] ) exhibit exactly the kind of subexponential instability for nearby trajectories that we are concerned here : @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "a distinctive characteristic of such class of maps is the presence of an indifferent ( neutral ) fixed point at @xmath12 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the global form of @xmath15 is irrelevant for our purposes , provided it respects the axioms of an afn - system @xcite .",
    "these systems are known to have invariant densities @xmath16 such that [ dens ] ( x)~bx^- , = ( z-1)^-1 , near the indifferent fixed point @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "clearly , the corresponding invariant measures diverge for @xmath17 . in these cases",
    ", we have pictorially two qualitative distinct dynamical behavior coexisting , namely a laminar regime near @xmath12 and a turbulent one elsewhere , resulting eventually in nonergodicty and subexponential separation of initially close trajectories .",
    "it is noteworthy here that it was recently shown that subexponencial instability does imply infinite invariant measure @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath18 leads to a finite invariant measure , which is naturally related to ergodicity and positivity of the ordinary lyapunov exponent .    for intermittent systems like ( [ pmap ] ) ,",
    "the statistics of a given observable @xmath19 for randomly distributed initial conditions has some peculiar properties . for ergodic systems",
    ", the time average @xmath20 converges to the spatial average @xmath21 , with @xmath22 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the system has a diverging invariant measure , the time average will typically depend on the chosen trajectory .",
    "nevertheless , the adk theorem @xcite ensures in this case that a suitable time - weighted average does converge in distribution terms towards a mittag - leffler distribution with unit first moment .",
    "more specifically , for a positive integrable function @xmath19 and a random variable @xmath23 with an absolutely continuous measure with respect to the lebesgue measure on the interval of interest , there is a sequence @xmath24 for which _ , for @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a non - negative mittag - leffler random variable with index @xmath27 $ ] and unit expected value .",
    "notice that for @xmath18 ( the ergodic regime ) , @xmath28 , and the corresponding @xmath29 mittag - leffler distribution reduces to a dirac @xmath30-function .",
    "for the subexponential regime ( @xmath17 ) , we have @xmath31 @xcite and , by choosing @xmath32 , the adk theorem assures the convergence in distribution terms towards a mittag - leffler distribution of the subexponential finite - time lyapunov exponent @xmath33 for @xmath34 . the generalized lyapunov exponent ( [ lamba ] ) plays for intermittent systems the same role did by the usual exponent ( corresponding to @xmath29 in ( [ lamba ] ) ) for one - dimensional chaotic systems , see @xcite and references therein for a recent discussion .",
    "in order to investigate the connection between subexponential instability and the corresponding degree of randomness of an intermittent dynamical system like ( [ pmap ] ) , we will consider the kolmogorov - chaitin concept of complexity @xcite .",
    "let us assume that the phase space of the map ( [ pmap ] ) is partitioned and completely covered by a set of non overlapping ordered cells .",
    "a given trajectory @xmath35 generated by the map ( [ pmap ] ) can be represented by a sequence of symbols @xmath36 , which we assume to be integers such that @xmath37 corresponds to the cell where @xmath38 belongs .",
    "the next step in the analysis consists in eliminating redundancies that may appear in @xmath36 by performing a compression of information .",
    "this can be done , for instance , by introducing the so - called algorithmic complexity function @xmath39 , which is defined as the length of the shortest possible program able to reconstruct the sequence @xmath36 on a universal turing machine @xcite .",
    "systems that exhibit some degree of regularity are able to generate sequences of symbols at a rate higher than needed for recording their programs . for example , a periodic sequence can be recreated by replaying the periodic pattern over the total lenght .",
    "typically , for these cases , one has @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the trajectory is completely random , there is no way of reproducing it other than memorizing the whole trajectory , resulting in a sequence length that increases linearly in time , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath41 .",
    "the finite time ks entropy is defined simply as @xmath42 .",
    "an important recent rigorous result due to zweimller @xcite unveils the relation between ks entropy and the lyapunov exponent for systems exhibiting subexponential instability .",
    "according to this result , we have , for almost all initial conditions , @xmath43 for @xmath34 , for any observable function @xmath19 , where @xmath44 stands for the krengel entropy @xcite , which can be expressed by the so - called rohlin s formula @xcite [ rohlin ] h_(f)=|f| d. by choosing again @xmath32 , we get from ( [ smb ] ) the surprisingly simple relation @xmath45 for @xmath25 and for almost all initial conditions , where @xmath46 is the subexponential generalization of the finite - time ks entropy .",
    "the relation ( [ pes ] ) is the most natural generalization of the pesin relation for systems of the type ( [ pmap ] ) . from the adk theorem and ( [ pes ] ) , we have that both @xmath47 and @xmath48 converge in distribution terms toward the same mittag - leffler distribution .",
    "nevertheless , zweimller s result is indeed stronger , assuring that , for almost all trajectories , @xmath47 coincides with @xmath48 in the limit @xmath25 . in this way",
    ", the relation ( [ smb ] ) does provide an efficient prescription for evaluating the algorithmic complexity of a given trajectory for one - dimensional maps , namely @xmath49 for large @xmath50 .",
    "the power of the prescription ( [ k ] ) resides in the fact that it does provide , for the systems in question , a computable way for the calculation of the algorithmic complexity function @xmath51 , a well - known non - computable function in general @xcite .",
    "it is important also to remind that , for dynamical systems with infinite invariant measure , the invariant density , and consequently , the invariant measure , is defined up to an arbitrary multiplicative positive constant . in other words ,",
    "the transformation @xmath52 ( implying , in this way , that @xmath53 in ( [ dens ] ) ) , with @xmath54 , does not have any dynamical implication .",
    "zweimller s construction , based in ( [ smb ] ) , is clear invariant under such transformation .",
    "of course , such `` symmetry '' is broken in the usual ergodic case due to the normalization of the invariant measure .",
    "we notice that the relation ( [ pes ] ) is compatible with the pioneering work of gaspard and wang @xcite , where the standard pm map @xmath55 ( mod 1 ) was considered .",
    "they argue , in particular , that the algorithmic complexity @xmath51 for the pm map is proportional to @xmath56 , the number of entrances into a given phase space cell during @xmath50 iterations of the pm map . by invoking some results from renewal theory @xcite ,",
    "one has @xmath57 for @xmath11 and @xmath34 , where @xmath58 is a positive constant and @xmath59 stands for the one - sided lvy cumulative distribution function with index @xmath60 . with the change of variable @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , we have that the normalized random variable @xmath63 tends toward a mittag - leffler random variable with index @xmath60 and unit first moment for @xmath25 ( see @xcite for more details on the relations between one - sided lvy and mittag - leffler distributions ) , in perfect agreement with the predictions of the adk theorem . the possibility of estimating the algorithmic complexity function @xmath51 from @xmath56 also for generic systems of the type ( [ pmap ] ) is indeed confirmed by our exhaustive numerical explorations .",
    "( see , also , @xcite and references therein . )",
    "the adk convergence of the generalized lyapunov exponent ( [ lamba ] ) was exhaustively checked and confirmed by numerical simulations for different maps in @xcite .",
    "the zweimller prescription for calculating the algorithmic complexity ( [ k ] ) assures also an adk - like convergence for the generalized ks entropy ( [ ks ] ) .",
    "a possible way of testing the consistence of the overall picture is to compare the zweimller prescription ( [ k ] ) with other independent prescription for calculating the algorithmic complexity @xmath64 . for this purpose ,",
    "we consider some simple realizations of the general maps of the type ( [ pmap ] ) , namely the standard pm case discussed in @xcite , the thaler map @xcite @xmath65^{-1/(z-2 ) } , \\label{tmap}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] mod 1 , and the so - called modified bernoulli map ( see @xcite for references ) [ bern ] f(x ) = \\ {    ll x + 2^z-1x^z , & 0 x , + x - 2^z-1(1-x)^z , & < x 1 .    .",
    "the modified bernoulli map ( [ bern ] ) has indeed two neutral fixed points at @xmath12 and @xmath66 , but this does not alter our analysis since we still have @xmath67 for @xmath17 in this case @xcite . motivated by the construction introduced in @xcite , let us consider the standard partition of the interval @xmath68 $ ] into two cells , @xmath69 $ ] and @xmath70 $ ] , where @xmath71 is the point of discontinuity of the maps , _",

    "the trajectories inside both cells @xmath76 and @xmath77 are typically regular , the turbulent behavior is associated with the transition from one cell to the other , see @xcite and fig [ fig0 ] .     and @xmath77 for the bernoulli map ( [ bern ] ) with @xmath78 .",
    "notice that the dynamics are regular inside each of the cells , with the trajectories departing monotonically from the respective fixed points . nevertheless , the transition for one cell to the other is chaotic .",

    "we could check by numerical simulations that the subexponential ks entropy ( [ ks ] ) calculated directly from @xmath56 , namely [ ks1 ] = , does converge toward a mittag - leffler distribution with unit expected value .",

    "we close with some final remarks on the work @xcite and what has led to its misleading conclusion that [ pes1 ] h_(f)=^()for systems of the type ( [ pmap ] ) .",
    "the first observation is that ( [ pes1 ] ) is incompatible with the re - scaling transformation @xmath52 , which must be a symmetry for the dynamics in the infinite measure case",
    ". the dynamical quantity on the right - handed side , whatever way the average is taken , must be invariant under such transformation , while the left - handed side is certainly not , see ( [ rohlin ] ) .",
    "such problem can be elucidated recalling that the adk theorem gives ( see , for instance , @xcite ) [ adk ] ^()_adk=()^|f(x)|(x)dx , from which rohlin s formula ( [ rohlin ] ) for the krengel entropy implies immediately that @xmath94 which is the correct relation between krengel entropy and a dynamically meaningful average of subexponential lyapunov exponents for maps of the type ( [ pmap ] ) .",
    "the adk average is not only a dynamically meaningful average , it is essentially _ the _ dynamically meaningful average for these systems .",
    "for instance , the average of the subexponential lyapunov exponents ( [ lamba ] ) calculated for randomly chosen ( with any absolutely continuous measure with respect to the usual lebesgue measure on the interval @xmath68 $ ] ) initial conditions @xmath23 will converge to the adk average for large @xmath50 , see @xcite for some recent applications of this important fact .",
    "notice also that both sides of ( [ kent ] ) are invariant under the symmetry @xmath52 .    a closer inspection of @xcite ( see , in particular , their eq .",
    "( 10 ) ) shows that they , when dealing with the continuous time stochastic linear model proposed in @xcite , tacitly choose a value for @xmath95 such that b=()^-1 , breaking the measure re - scaling symmetry of ( [ kent ] ) and rendering it in its @xmath95-dependent form ( [ pes1 ] ) .",
    "however , one could have chosen any other value for @xmath95 , leading to a distinct value of @xmath96 and to a completely different `` relation '' between the krengel entropy and the adk average .",
    "since these relations do depend on some specific multiplicative constant of the infinite invariant measure , they have no dynamical meaning .",
    "it is interesting to notice that @xmath97 is also considered as a mittag - leffler random variable in @xcite by using renewal theory in a different manner , but its relation to @xmath64 is not stated .",
    "instead , it is used as hypothesis that @xmath98 in order to conclude that @xmath48 is mittag - leffler distributed .",
    "such assumption presumes the convergence for almost all trajectories , which is indeed correct , but it is a very strong assumption without a prior knowledge of zweimller s relation ( [ smb ] ) .",
    "we close by noticing that , comparing ( [ pes ] ) and ( [ kent ] ) , it is clear that the subexponential ks entropy is the appropriate entropy for extending pesin relation for weakly chaotic systems .",
    "relation ( [ pes ] ) is simpler than ( [ kent ] ) and , mainly , it is more powerful since it holds for almost all single trajectories , in contrast with ( [ kent ] ) , where a statistic description involving many trajectories is necessary ( and , moreover , an invariant measure , which usually is not explicitly known , is required for the calculation of krengel entropy ) .",
    "furthermore , the ergodic transition @xmath99 in ( [ kent ] ) is rather awkward in comparison with the same transition for the relation ( [ pes ] ) , which is straightforward and natural since the mittag - leffler distribution tends to a dirac @xmath30-function for @xmath100 .",
