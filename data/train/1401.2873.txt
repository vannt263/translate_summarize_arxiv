    "after this , in @xcite , the analysis of @xcite was generalized with the computation of the frequency - dependent angular pattern of interferometers in the gauge of @xcite , while in @xcite the angular pattern was only computed in the low frequencies approximation ( wavelength much larger than the linear dimensions of the interferometer , under this assumption the amplitude of the sgw , @xmath1 , can be considered  frozen  at a value @xmath2 ) .    in this paper",
