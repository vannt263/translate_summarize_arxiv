    "according to the big bang theory , the universe has been expanding and cooling . during its early evolution , the universe has been underwent a series of phase transitions characterized by spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "these phase transitions are important , because they provide a mechanism for the formation of topological defects such as domain walls , monopoles , cosmic string , among others @xcite . in the eighties of last century",
    "the interest to cosmic strings has been increase due to the fact that they were considered candidates to provide a mechanism for the large - scale structure formation in the universe . although the recent observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation have ruled out cosmic strings as seed for the primordial density perturbations , they are still candidates to explain a small non - gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background and the influence on the temperature anisotropies .",
    "such effects had origins in the gravitational fields of cosmic strings in motion @xcite .",
    "in addition , astrophysical and cosmological consequences of formation of strings are emission of gravitational waves and high energy cosmic rays such as neutrinos and gamma - rays .",
    "these observational data can help to constraint the product of the newton s constant @xmath0 to the linear mass density of cosmic string , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these effects are generated by cosmic strings formed under inflation context which makes the physics of cosmic strings a vast area of interest .    the first theoretical model associated with strings - like solutions was given by nielsen and olesen @xcite by using an abelian higgs model lagrangian which presents a spontaneously @xmath2 gauge symmetry broken .",
    "these solutions were also named by * vortex*. the influence of this system on the geometry of the spacetime has been analyzed in @xcite many years ago , by coupling the energy - momentum tensor associated with the nielsen and olesen string with the einstein equations . in these papers ,",
    "static and cylindrically solutions for the matter and gauge fields and also for the metric tensor , were investigated numerically by using coupled ordinary non - linear differential equations .",
    "a few years latter the abelian higgs model has also investigated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the so - called ( p , q ) gravitating cosmic string have been analyzed numerically in @xcite . in the latter , static and cylindrically solutions of the system containing two different abelian gauge fields coupled with two bosonic sectors",
    "were investigated .    in this paper",
    "we are interested to analyze the cosmic string solution again , however , considering at this time the @xmath3 non - abelian higgs model coupled to gravity . as it was also shown in @xcite , to create a non - abelian topological stable string , it is necessary the presence of two bosonic iso - vectors coupled with the gauge field .",
    "the interaction potential should present terms with fourth powers in these bosonic fields in order to have spontaneously gauge symmetry broken .",
    "moreover , it may contain a direct interaction between these bosonic sectors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we present the non - abelian higgs model coupled to gravity and analyze the conditions that the physical parameters contained in the potential should satisfy in order the system provides stable topological solutions . in section [ ansatz ] we present the ansatz for the matter and gauge fields , and for the metric tensor .",
    "the equations of motion and boundary conditions obeyed by the fields and metric tensor are presented in section [ equation ] . in section",
    "[ numerical ] we exhibit our numerical results for the behaviors of the fields considering different values of the relevant parameters . in this section",
    "we present a comparison of this non - abelian system with the abelian one .",
    "also we investigate the behaviors of the energy density of the string and planar angle deficit , as functions of the energy scale where the @xmath3 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken and the interaction coupling between the bosonic sectors . in section [ concl ]",
    "we give our conclusions and in the appendix we present a special solution of the system that , although the corresponding configuration is not in according to stable topological configuration , it behaves as a bps solution of the fields equations .",
    "the model that we want to study is described by the following action , @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the ricci scalar , @xmath0 denotes the newton s constant and @xmath7 is the matter lagrangian density of the non - abelian higgs model given by @xmath8 the field strength tensor is @xmath9 with the @xmath3 gauge potential @xmath10 , and @xmath11 being the gauge coupling constant .",
    "the covariant derivatives of the higgs fields are given by @xcite , @xmath12 @xmath13 where the latin indices denote the internal gauge groups @xmath14 .",

    "the potential above has different properties according to the sign of @xmath22 :    * for @xmath23 , the potential has positive value and its minimum is attained for @xmath24 and @xmath25 . * for @xmath26 ,",
    "these configuration becomes saddle points and two minima occur for : @xmath27 and @xmath28 the values of the potential for these cases are , respectively , @xmath29 both values for @xmath30 are negatives , since @xmath26 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for the higgs and gauge fields , and the einstein equations for the metric tensor are obtained as presented below .",
