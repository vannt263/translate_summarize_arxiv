    "humans begin to form categories and abstractions at an early age  @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms underlying human category formation are the subject of many competing accounts , including those based on prototypes  @xcite , exemplars  @xcite , density estimation  @xcite , and bayesian inference  @xcite .",
    "but all modern models agree that human category representations involve subjective variations in the typicality or probability of objects within categories .",
    "for example , bird category includes both highly typical examples such as robins , as well as extremely atypical examples like penguins and ostriches , which while belonging to the category seem like subjectively  abnormal \" examples .",
    "visual images can seem abnormal , in that they can exhibit features that depart in some way from what is typical for the categories to which they belong . in this paper , we ask what makes visual images seem abnormal with respect to their apparent categories , something that human observers can readily judge but is difficult to capture computationally .        [",
    "fig : intro ]    abnormality detection plays a substantial role in broad range of tasks : learning visual concepts  @xcite , natural languages processing  @xcite , human perception and cognition  @xcite , human action recognition  @xcite , etc . in computer vision ,",
    "abnormality in the context of object and scene categorization is an under - studied problem .",
    "in contrast to humans ability to generalize and successfully categorize atypical instances  @xcite , state - of - the - art computer vision algorithms fail to achieve similar generalization .",
    "table  [ tab : deeplearning ] shows categorization results of several state - of - the - art approaches  @xcite when tested on our dataset of abnormal images .",
    "this highlights the lack of generalization of these approaches and the importance of studying the problem of abnormality . in this paper",
    "we focus on understanding the causes of abnormality and reasoning about it .",
    "we address the problem of abnormalities in images and present computational models to detect atypical instances of categories , where the model is trained only on normal images .",
    "* challenges : * there are several issues and concerns in abnormality detection . _",
    "first _ , researchers are not in an agreement about what is a typical sample of a category and what makes humans distinguish typical instances from atypical ones  @xcite .",
    "the definition of abnormality in the visual space is even more complex .",
    "for example , there is no general rule as what is a typical car .",
    "even if there were such a rule , it might vary across people and categories .",
    "_ second _ , abnormality ( atypicality ) in images is a complex notion that happens because of a diverse set of reasons that can be related to shape , texture , color , context , pose , location or even a combination of them .",
    "figure  [ fig : intro ] shows large variability of abnormality reasons among examples of car images that human subjects denoted as abnormal .",
    "_ third _ , there is a gradual transition from typical to atypical instances , so simple discriminative boundary learning between typical and atypical instances does not seem appropriate .",
    "fourth , with the limited number of abnormal images it is hard to be comprehensive with all aspects of abnormality .",
    "this suggests that computational models for identifying abnormalities should not rely on training samples of abnormal images .",
    "this is also aligned with how humans are capable of recognizing abnormal images while only observing typical samples  @xcite .    _",
    "the goal of this paper is to extract a list of reasons of atypicality , enumerating distinct modes or types of abnormal images , and to derive computational models motivated by human abnormality classification . _",
    "the contribution of this paper is manifold .",
    "we conduct a human - subject experiment to determine a typology of images judged abnormal by human observers and collect data that facilitates discovery of a taxonomy of atypicality .",
    "analysis of the data lead us to a coarse taxonomy of three reasons for abnormality : object - centric , scene - centric , and contextual .",
    "we propose a model for normality ( typicality ) in images and find meaningful deviations from this normality model as the case of abnormality .",
    "the model is fully trained using only normal images . based on the model we propose and evaluate scoring functions that can predict the three types of atypicalities . in contrast to prior work on this topic , which were limited to specific types of abnormality ( as will be discussed in the next section )",
    "our work is a more comprehensive study that is supported and justified by perceptual experiments .",
    "we also propose a new dataset for image abnormality research that is more complete than what was previously used in this area . with the final version of this paper",
    "we will publish the dataset along with the human subject experiment results and implementation of our computational models .",
    "space does not allow an encyclopedic review of the anomaly detection literature [ see  @xcite ] . in computer vision ,",
    "researchers have studied abnormality detection in events or activities in videos as deviation from normal temporal patterns  @xcite ; modeling out - of - context objects using a tree model that encodes normal scene layout  @xcite ; identifying abnormal images using contextual cues such as unexpected relative location or size of objects  @xcite ; reasoning about object - centric abnormalities using an attribute - based framework  @xcite ; or investigating the connection between image memorability and abnormality  @xcite . from a cognitive point of view , abnormality has also been studied  @xcite ; or by a combination of human intervention and scene classifiers on sun dataset  @xcite .",
    "biederman  ( @xcite ) investigates violations in a scene according to five semantic relations : support , interposition , probability , position and size .",
    "[ tab : deeplearning ]    among all possible reasons for abnormality , previous work has mainly focused on isolated and specific kinds of abnormalities ; for example , rooted in either objects  @xcite or context  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we first investigate the different reasons for abnormality , and provide evidence that supports our proposed clusters of reasons . following this grouping",
    ", we introduce a comprehensive framework for detecting and classifying different types of atypicalities in images .",
    "the taxonomy of abnormality in images is not well - defined either in psychology or computer vision .",
    "we design a human subject experiment to discover a coarse taxonomy for abnormality . to this end",
    ", we first need to collect a dataset of abnormal images that is more comprehensive than what has been used in prior work .    * 1001 abnormal image dataset : * previous datasets for abnormality research are either not specifically designed for the task of abnormality detection  @xcite , or limited to a specific type of abnormality [ @xcite are focused on contextual cues , and  @xcite is concerned with object - centric reasons ) ] ; or of small size [ @xcite has 40 and  @xcite has 200 images ] .    in order to study abnormalities in images with more details , this paper introduces a dataset that is more comprehensive both in terms of the number of images and types of abnormality . to collect this dataset , we started by gathering images from three public datasets used in  @xcite , which we call  initial collection \" and almost doubled the size by adding more images from the web .",
    "our image collection process is similar to  @xcite , but textual queries that we used for image search are not limited to abnormal objects . for examples",
    ", we used  strange street \" or ",
    "weird living room \" as additional queries .",
    "after downloading a large number of images , we pruned the result by removing duplicates and very low - quality images .",
    "then we merged these images and  initial collection \" into the final dataset with a total number of 1001 unique abnormal images .",
    "figure  [ fig : intro ] shows some images of this dataset .",
    "we validated our collection and acquired image annotations by conducting a human - subject experiment , which is explained next .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : conf ]",
    "in this paper we approached the challenging research question : what make an image look abnormal ?",
    "we made the biggest dataset of abnormal images and conducted a large - scale human subject experiment to investigate how humans think about abnormal images .",
    "we proposed a diverse list of abnormality reasons by human responses , and inferred a taxonomy of visual cues that make an image abnormal .",
    "based on three major components of this taxonomy we built computer vision models that can detect an abnormal images and reason about this decision in terms of three surprise scores . digging deeper into the categories of the inferred taxonomy is an important future work ."
