    "studies of many body systems , like the sophisticated fields of atomic , nuclear and particle physics , have seen new and versatile enrichment under the auspices of quantum information theory . on one side we are aware of the implications of a first principle treatment of complex quantum mechanical systems and on the other side we are aware of less sophisticated phenomenological solutions that simplify the many body systems significantly .",
    "phenomenology requires only a few degrees of freedom and introduces effective intensive and extensive matter properties .",
    "the growing awareness and hope to exploit entanglement of quantum mechanical systems , as a new resource , has fostered many fields to investigate their realm also within the terminology of information theory .",
    "this is undoubtedly the case for a wide range of molecular and atomic systems and less for nuclear and particle physics .",
    "at least currently , the latter systems are not guided by practical applications but rather epistemological virtues .",
    "nuclear geometries are realized with nuclear structure calculations or measurements in conjunction with direct nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "their values are now available in comprehensive tables and the data - groups continue their program as new facilities advent . in terms of information theory ,",
    "nuclear physics is still in its infancy .",
    "shannon information entropy , together with quantum information theory , has been the subject of many theoretical studies @xcite . for its realization",
    "we know many cases with a fundamental microscopic approach as well as approaches which prefer a phenomenological access to information theory @xcite . in any case ,",
    "the shannon information entropy and quantum information entropy ( @xmath5 ) are closely related .",
    "the first uses a normalized set of probabilities , the other uses the density matrix formalism and a normalized trace . the density matrix is diagonalized and the eigenvalues are taken as probabilities to calculate @xmath5 @xmath6    the eigenvectors are generally not used to define a probability distribution , but investigations along such line have been done and produced interesting results and conclusions . to distinguish their input approach , from the full density matrix @xmath5 , it is said , shannon information entropy is calculated , with entities in _",
    "r- _ and _ k-_space , for atoms @xcite , and more recently for nuclei , atomic clusters and boson traps @xcite in particular .    in subnano physics @xmath5 is everywhere present .",
    "it reduces radically any genuine and detailed information of a many particle system and the normalization condition eliminates any aspect of relative scales which are existing within physical quantities and are the key for prevalence and subordinate . within the set @xmath7 ,",
    "the succession is irrelevant . as such",
    ", the pure mathematical aspect of @xmath5 is impossible to escape and any set of positive definite normalized physical data are used as a potential set @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the resulting information entropy does not automatically have a physical interpretation since an abstract scheme of order or disorder is now in vogue .    with this outline in mind",
    ", we do not hesitate to augment nucleon - nucleus @xmath9 cross sections with the expression of information entropy . in this way we concatenate geometry , kinematics and dynamics of nuclear reactions .",
    "we expect that these entities are separable and thus imply a linear relation for measures of @xmath5 .",
    "this conjecture is based upon a uniform probability distribution , to simplify the @xmath5 relation , for all partial wave scattering amplitudes , which form our input data @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the grazing ( largest relevant ) angular momentum .",
    "this is determined from the grazing radius @xmath13 , for which a nuclear fermi distribution implies @xmath14 with @xmath15[fm ] and @xmath16[fm ] .",
    "the masses ( projectile , target ) @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 determine the wave number @xmath20    a uniform distribution , @xmath21 , implies @xmath5 to be @xmath22 .",
    "together with the approximated @xmath23 and @xmath24 values , this gives a desirable linear dependence @xmath25 with @xmath26    eq .",
    "( [ simple - ie ] ) is interesting in itself , as it recalls the well known physiological sensitivity of biological sense - organs which often show a logarithmic dependence on magnitudes , i.e. sound pressure or light intensity .",
    "as one knows , animals alike humans are very able to notice and detect small structural differences , even within a chaotic environment , thus we anticipate propitious support also from information entropy for the physics of many body systems and in particular for quantum scattering .",
    "it is not difficult to improve eq .",
    "( [ simple - ie ] ) and foresee departures from simplicity with nonlinear dependencies between the variables ( @xmath27 ) . to this end",
    ", we performed accurate numerical studies with realistic input data and compiled results for many nuclei and projectile energies , ranging from low to medium energies , @xmath28[gev ] .",
    "the following sections contain the relevant scattering theory , related input data , numerical results and the final summary and conclusions .",

    "we suppress the coulomb amplitude @xmath31 and use only the sum of partial wave amplitudes .",

    "it is necessary to use the full power of the density matrix formalism with diagonalization .",
    "this formalism is well developed and general scattering programs , for low and medium energy scattering , are available .",
    "a range of such programs has been developed by j. raynal , cen - saclay , with older as well as more current versions of dwba , with a sophisticated microscopic approach suited for @xmath29 scattering , and versions of the coupled channels code ecis @xcite .    for introductory studies",

    "such a microscopic approach is our choice for this study and we are using the argonne av18 @xmath46 potential @xcite . hereby , we generalized av18 above pion production threshold to become a complex @xmath46 optical potential @xcite .",
