    "although oxygen is an important tracer of galactic chemical evolution , only a few spectral lines are available for its diagnostics in extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars . in red giant stars , [ o  i ] 630  nm line can be used , however , in the emp regime it is very weak and frequently blended with telluric oxygen lines ( [ o  i ] and @xmath2 band ) .",
    "alternatively , oxygen abundances can be derived from ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) oh lines but results obtained using molecular and atomic lines are frequently discrepant : for example , abundances obtained from ir  oh lines are typically @xmath3  dex higher than those determined from the forbidden [ o  i ] 630  nm line .",
    "one possible reason behind these discrepancies is that 1d hydrostatic model atmospheres that are used in the abundance analysis do not account for the horizontal fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities arising from convective motions in stellar atmospheres .",
    "since formation of oh lines is very sensitive to the effects of convection ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one may expect that application of 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres in the abundance analysis may diminish , or even eliminate , the differences in oxygen abundances obtained from atomic and molecular lines .    in this contribution",
    "we therefore study whether a more realistic modeling of convection may bring the oxygen abundances obtained from molecular ir  oh lines into better agreement with those determined using forbidden [ o  i ] 630  nm line ( note that [ o  i ] 630  nm line is insensitive to 3d hydrodynamical _ and _ nlte effects , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . to this end , we used spectra of three emp giants obtained with the vlt  crires spectrograph , as well as 3d hydrodynamical co@xmath0bold  and 1d hydrostatic lhd  model atmospheres , to better understand the role of convection in the formation of ir  oh lines .",
    "all results obtained in this analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper @xcite , while in this contribution we briefly summarize some of the most important findings .",
    "we used high resolution ( @xmath4 ) and high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath5 ) near - infrared ( @xmath6-band ) spectra of 3 emp stars ( @xmath7}}=-2.6 $ ] to 3.1 , see table  1 ) obtained with the crires spectrograph at the vlt  ut1 telescope ( program i d 089.d-0079(a ) ; a sample spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) . for each star",
    ", oxygen abundances were determined using the measured equivalent widths of vibrational - rotational ir  oh lines ( @xmath8 ) from the first - overtone sequence located in the spectral range of @xmath9  nm .",
    "atmospheric parameters and iron abundances used in the abundance determination were taken from the literature .",
    "abundance analysis was done in 1d  lte with the atlas9  model atmospheres .",
    "the obtained 1d  lte oxygen abundances were corrected for the 3d hydrodynamical effects , by applying 3d1d abundance corrections to oxygen abundances determined from each individual ir  oh line . the 3d1d abundance corrections ( i.e. , differences in the abundance of a given chemical element obtained from the same spectral line using 3d hydrodynamical and 1d hydrostatic model atmospheres ) were computed with the 3d hydrodynamical co@xmath0bold  @xcite and 1d hydrostatic lhd  model atmosphere codes @xcite .",
    "the two types of model atmospheres shared identical elemental abundances , atmospheric parameters , equation of state , and opacities .",
    "abundance corrections were derived using a single 3d hydrodynamical model atmosphere computed using the following atmospheric parameters : @xmath10  k , @xmath11 , @xmath12}}=-2.5 $ ] .",
    "we note that differences between the atmospheric parameters of this 3d hydrodynamical model and those of the target emp stars studied here did not exceed @xmath13  k , @xmath14 , and @xmath15}}= 0.6 $ ] .",
    "such differences would lead to only minor deviations in the abundance corrections , the size of which ( typically , a few hundredths of a dex ) would render them unimportant in the context of the present study .",
    "the 3d hydrodynamical co@xmath0bold  model atmosphere used in our work had a spatial resolution of @xmath16 elements , corresponding to the physical size of @xmath17  gm in @xmath18 directions , respectively .",
    "the solution of radiative transfer equation was made using opacity binning technique @xcite , by sorting opacities into 6 bins .",
    "the opacities were taken from the marcs  model atmosphere package @xcite .",
    "a sample vlt  crires spectrum with the gaussian fits to ir  oh lines is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the obtained 1d  lte and 3d  lte oxygen abundances , as well as abundances determined using forbidden [ o  i ] 630  nm line ( literature data ) , are provided in table  [ table : stars - abundances ] .",

    "all models were computed using identical atmospheric parameters ( @xmath10  k , @xmath11 , @xmath12}}=-2.5 $ ] ) , chemical composition , equation of state , and opacities .",
    "horizontal bars indicate the range in optical depth where typical ir  oh line forms ( i.e. , its where equivalent width increases from 5% to 95% ; parameters of this particular line were : wavelength @xmath24  nm , excitation potential @xmath25  ev ) : black and dashed blue bars correspond to the line forming regions in the full 3d and 1d model atmospheres ( the equivalent widths of oh lines in both cases were 1.6  pm ) . * bottom panel : * rms value of horizontal temperature fluctuations in the 3d model ( black line ) and temperature difference between the average @xmath26 and 1d models ( dashed blue line).[fig : t - profiles],width=453 ]",
    "results provided in table  [ table : stars - abundances ] show that oxygen abundances determined using 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres are always smaller than those obtained with 1d hydrostatic models : 3d1d differences for the three stars are in the range of @xmath27  dex .",
    "these differences are a result of large horizontal fluctuations of thermodynamic and hydrodynamical quantities in 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres of these stars that arise because of convective motions in their outer atmospheric layers .",
    "horizontal temperature fluctuations are clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - profiles ] , where we show temperature profiles of the 3d hydrodynamical , average @xmath26 , and 1d model atmospheres computed using identical atmospheric parameters , chemical composition , equation of state , and opacities . in fact , the presence of large temperature fluctuations ( which increase towards the outer atmospheric layers characterized with lower @xmath23 values ) seems to be a general property of different types of stars and is seen routinely in their 3d hydrodynamical model structures ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "large horizontal temperature fluctuations lead to larger oh line opacities in the low - temperature regions .",
    "this , in turn , results in stronger lines in 3d , negative abundance corrections , and thus , lower 3d  lte abundances .    in fact , it is not only the horizontal temperature fluctuations that influence the formation and strengths of ir  oh lines .",
    "the differences between the average temperature profile of the 3d model and that in 1d hydrostatic model do play a role , too . since the average @xmath26 model is slightly hotter in the optical depths where ir  oh lines form ( @xmath28 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : t - profiles ] ) , this results in somewhat weaker lines in @xmath26 , and thus , small but positive abundance corrections . this slightly diminishes the effect of horizontal temperature fluctuations and leads to smaller ( i.e. , in the absolute sense ) total 3d1d abundance corrections .    at the same time",
    ", we obtain a good agreement between the 3d  lte oxygen abundances and those obtained in 1d  lte using forbidden [ o  i ] 630  nm line .",
    "the agreement is especially good in hd  122563 and hd  186478 , where the difference between abundances obtained using the two indicators is smaller than @xmath29  dex . although differences are larger in bd  18:5550 , note that in this case 1d  lte abundance measurement is less reliable , as indicated in @xcite .",
    "the obtained results therefore demonstrate that the use of 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres may allow to reconcile oxygen abundances obtained from ir  oh lines and [ o  i ] 630  nm line .",
    "nevertheless , one should note that nlte effects may play a role in the formation of oh lines at low metallicities .",
    "the impact here may be two - fold .",
    "first , formation and dissociation of oh molecules may be affected by non - equilibrium effects and thus non - equilibrium oh number densities may be different from those where equilibrium molecular formation is assumed .",
    "second , ir  oh lines may form in the conditions that are far from lte , thus nlte line strengths may be different from those that would be expected in lte .",
    "it is quite likely that both effects may be important in the atmospheres of emp red giants , especially in the outer atmospheric layers were molecular lines form ( note , however , that the forbidden [ o  i ] 630  nm line seems to be insensitive to 3d hydrodynamical and nlte effects , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the future , these effects should be properly taken into account using full 3d  nlte analysis methodology ."
