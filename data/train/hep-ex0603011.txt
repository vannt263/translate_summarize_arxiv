    "the strong interaction , the main focus of this review , is responsible for the existence of all composite elementary particles ( hadrons ) by providing the binding force between the constituents and also for most of the short lived hadron decays .",

    "studies of differences between quark and gluon jets reveal many properties of the gauge bosons of qcd , the gluons , which are correctly predicted by the theory .",
    "the measurements of jet production rates and event shape observables using theoretically and experimentally well behaved observables allow direct tests of advanced perturbative qcd predictions and precise determinations of the value of the strong coupling constant @xmath58 .",
    "a fundamental prediction by qcd is asymptotic freedom of the coupling at high energies and this has been verified directly using data over a large range of cms energies .",
    "more indirect tests of asymptotic freedom stem from successful comparison of precision determinations of @xmath58  at different energy scales .",
    "the most reliable and precise determinations of @xmath58  in @xmath0annihilation to hadrons employ inclusive observables such as the hadronic branching ratios of the gauge bosons of the electroweak theory , @xmath59 , @xmath1  and @xmath60 .",
    "the inclusive observables are mostly unaffected by hadronisation corrections and they are accessible to nnlo perturbative qcd calculations with 2-loop radiative corrections . the final result for @xmath5  from inclusive observables calculated in nnlo perturbative qcd is @xmath61 this result is in good agreement with recent world averages of measurements of the strong coupling constant @xmath62  @xcite or @xmath63  @xcite which are based on all available analyses .",
    "the best measurements of @xmath5  including ours shown above yield errors of about 2% .",
    "the other determinations of @xmath58  discussed in this report are found to be in good agreement with our main result and we note that the results from analyses of the 4-jet rate using the durham or cambridge algorithms are of similar precision .",
    "further improvements in the near future may be expected from nnlo calculations for 3-jet observables which are expected to reduce the otherwise dominating theoretical uncertainties and might allow total uncertainties of 1%  @xcite .",
    "studies of the gauge structure of qcd using angular correlations in 4-jet final states , 3-jet observables at different energy scales and quark and gluon jet differences were discussed .",
    "the results for the colour factors @xmath23  and @xmath24  were observed to be in good agreement and combined values were calculated .",

    "@xmath0  annihilation to hadrons has been and still is indispensable to stringently probe the theory of strong interactions .",
    "qcd has been established as a part of the standard model of high energy physics and has been tested to a precision of 2% with some well suited observables .",
    "this impressive result has been achieved by the lep experiments , sld , the re - analysis of jade data and the parallel theoretical work stimulated by the availability of precise data .",
