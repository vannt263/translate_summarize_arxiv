    "since intriligator , seiberg and shih showed in their seminal paper @xcite that long lived , supersymmetry - breaking metastable vacua arose in simple theories , such as sqcd in the free magnetic phase , many works have studied models of particle physics based upon iss - type constructions . a minimum requirement for these models to be considered as plausible descriptions of the particle interactions in nature",
    "is that the lifetime of the relevant vacuum should be greater than the estimated age of the universe .    ref .",
    "@xcite argued that the lifetime of the iss vacuum in the original model depended parametrically on the ratio between the dynamical scale @xmath0 of the gauge interactions and the mass scale @xmath1 of the low - energy magnetic theory , which is related to the masses of the electric quarks .",
    "thus , long enough lifetimes are guaranteed for @xmath2 , which can always be achieved by pushing @xmath0 to higher energies .",
    "a similar situation holds for models in which r - symmetry violating interactions involving a new scale @xmath3 are introduced , as in ref .",
    "@xcite ; in this case the decay towards supersymmetric vacua is parametrically suppressed for @xmath4 . however , since @xmath5 determines the gaugino masses while @xmath1 ends up controlling the squark soft masses , the ratio @xmath6 can not be made too small without creating a very fine - tuned spectrum . in principle",
    "it is not completely clear whether this will be in conflict with the vacuum being sufficiently stable , but the results of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that this is not necessarily the case . here a more a more detailed numerical analysis will be presented .",
    "another threat to the stability of the vacuum appears when the iss model is coupled to elementary spectators . in models based upon iss constructions and attempting to link supersymmetry breaking with flavor physics , such as those of refs .",
    "@xcite , some of the generations of the standard model are embedded into the meson fields of the low energy theory ; generically , this can not be done without having light mesons in undesired representations of the gauge group , which have to be lifted by coupling them to elementary spectators .",
    "these new couplings give rise to new metastable vacua involving nonzero expectation values for the spectator fields , which have lower energy than the iss vacuum @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the decays towards supersymmetric minima , which exhibit the parametric suppressions alluded to before , it is not clear whether the decay rates towards the new vacua will have a strong dependence on the ratios of scales ; at least for weak r - symmetry breaking interactions , the rates are expected to be mainly determined by a dimensionless coupling which can not be made parametrically small in phenomenologically acceptable models .",
    "it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that by making the electric quarks appropriately non - degenerate , the energy of the new vacua can be lifted above that of the iss vacuum , which would prevent the decay . however , in models attempting to explain gaugino masses this solution is unsatisfactory , since the consideration of nondegenerate masses for the electric quarks leads to a suppression of the gaugino masses arising from r - symmetry breaking interactions @xcite .",
    "thus , in models with degenerate quark masses and spectator fields , with no extra mass scales involved in the interactions of the latter otherwise it is straightforward to lift the vacua involving spectator vevs above the iss vacuum a more detailed estimation of the decay rates is needed in order to discern whether the iss - type vacua are long - lived enough .",
    "this paper presents new calculations of the decay rates of iss vacua in models with degenerate electric quarks , both towards supersymmetric vacua and towards vacua involving expectation values for spectator fields , in theories with and without r - symmetry breaking interactions .",
    "these calculations were performed by solving numerically for the semiclassical bounce configurations that dominate the path integral representing the decay amplitude @xcite .",
    "the computation is not straightforward due to the fact that the bounce configurations involve several fields ; it was tackled following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , with up to five fields .",
    "also , since some of the vacua are only stabilized after taking into account quantum corrections , these have to be taken into account when solving for the bounce configurations .",
    "partial results were already quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here a more complete presentation is given as well as results involving less approximations .",
    "the results confirm the qualitative dependence of the bounce action on dimensionless couplings and ratios of scales that can be extracted by identifying the small parameters that dominate the relevant contributions to the potential .",
    "thus , the decays towards susy vacua generated by nonperturbative interactions are indeed parametrically suppressed for growing values of the ratio @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , the decays towards susy vacua generated by r - symmetry breaking interactions are suppressed for diminishing @xmath8 .",
    "finally , the decays towards vacua involving nonzero vevs of spectator fields are controlled essentially by the dimensionless parameter @xmath9 present in the iss model superpotential , although for fixed @xmath9 they are enhanced by increasing @xmath8 .",
    "this last property could not be captured by the simplified calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , which ignored r - symmetry breaking interactions , and used only a rough estimation of the gauge fields one - loop contributions to the scalar potential .",
    "analytic estimations of the scaling of the bounce action with respect to the above dimensionless parameters , that were previously obtained in the literature by assuming a triangular barrier and restricting to one field direction , are confirmed for the decays towards the nonperturbative susy vacua . in the case of susy vacua with @xmath10 , the analytical scaling obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is valid for @xmath4 , which is not the regime studied here numerical fluctuations make it hard to explore .",
    "the scaling obtained here differs from the triangular barrier result , but the latter could still be valid for @xmath4 .",
    "regarding the resulting lifetimes , all decays to susy vacua , including the case with r - symmetry breaking interactions , turn out to be more than sufficiently suppressed for typical , phenomenologically acceptable values of the parameters , so that demanding long - lived vacua does not impose phenomenologically relevant constraints . in the case of models with spectator fields , centering on the case in which the magnetic group is trivial and for diagonal spectator fields ( i.e. coupling to the diagonal of the meson field matrix ) , sufficiently long lifetimes can be achieved for small , nonzero @xmath5 ( perfectly safe regarding the decays towards susy vacua ) and order one values of @xmath9 ; for the choice of parameters of  [ subsec : numerics : spect ] , the bounce action for sufficiently high values of @xmath11 scales roughly ( up to errors around 10% ) as @xmath12 regarding off - diagonal spectators ( coupling to off - diagonal mesons ) , they are expected to generate milder instabilities than the diagonal ones : the new vacua are either further from the origin of field space or involve more fields getting a vev , which implies an increase in the number of tunneling directions . hence ,",
    "if a model is safe with respect to decays towards vacua associated with diagonal spectator fields , it is expected that it will also be safe concerning decays to vacua generated by off - diagonal spectators .",
    "thus only the first type decays were analyzed in detail .",
    "finally , it should be commented that there exist other potential sources of instabilities in iss - type models , which do not involve tunneling processes but rather growing classical solutions , such as q - balls .",
    "@xcite argued that by making the dimensionless coupling @xmath9 of the iss model greater than the gauge coupling @xmath13 of the gauged global symmetry , @xmath14 , then q - balls are unstable towards decay to massive vector bosons and they do not threat the stability of the theory .",
    "this requirement seems in tension with the fact that the decay rate towards spectator vacua grows for increasing values of h see eq .",
    "[ eq : spectscaling ] .",
    "the above bound applies when the full global symmetry is gauged , so that the goldstone modes of the global symmetry are eaten away and do not support q - ball solutions .",
    "the situation worsens in models in which only a subgroup is gauged , since then the goldstone modes become pseudo - goldstone modes with masses of the order @xmath15 , which can support q - balls and can not decay to other particles .",
    "however , there is a possible way out consisting in gauging the global u(1 ) symmetry that guarantees the existence of q - balls .",
    "this gauging seems to make the q - balls unstable , at least for large values of the gauge coupling @xcite .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : vacua ] reviews the iss model , including the iss vacuum , the supersymmetric vacua and the vacua arising when spectator fields are added .",
    "section [ sec : numerics ] deals with the numerical calculations . ",
    "[ subsec : numerics : gen ] introduces the numerical method , while  [ subsec : numerics : dimensionless ] introduces a dimensionless parameterization of the bounce action , which allows to extract qualitative conclusions about the dependence of the latter with respect to the couplings and scale ratios of the theory .",
    "the results for decays towards susy vacua with and without r - symmetry breaking and for vacua involving spectator fields are given in   [ subsec : numerics : susyr ] , [ subsec : numerics : susynor ] and [ subsec : numerics : spect ] , respectively .",
    "an appendix has been included , providing formulae for the tree - level mass matrices and the coleman - weinberg potential .",
    "this paper focuses on weakly coupled iss - type supersymmetric models involving an @xmath16 gauge group , an @xmath17 matrix @xmath18 of singlet meson fields , and fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 ``magnetic quarks'' in the fundamental and antifundamental representations of the gauge group .",
    "the superpotential for the basic model is @xcite @xmath21 where the suffix `` mag '' is chosen to emphasize the fact that these models arise as low energy descriptions of @xmath22 sqcd with @xmath23 massive flavors in the free magnetic phase , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "@xmath26 is a matrix of mass parameters , which can be related to the mass matrix of the electric quarks in the dual theory as @xmath27 @xmath0 being the dynamical scale of the electric @xmath22 gauge group . for the rest of the paper",
    ", the focus will be on degenerate electric quarks , yielding @xmath28 .",
    "apart from the weakly coupled superpotential @xmath29 , one has to take into account nonperturbative contributions generated by the gauge dynamics , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the dynamical scale in the magnetic theory , related to @xmath0 as @xcite @xmath32 the theory has a global @xmath33 symmetry under which the fields transform as    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in typical models , as in applications to gauge mediation or models with composite generations , a diagonal subgroup @xmath34 , @xmath35 is gauged , where @xmath36 contains the standard model group .",
    "similarly , models usually involve the gauging of one or more @xmath37 factors in order to lift massless goldstone modes around the soon to be reviewed iss vacuum @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the possibility of coupling the meson field to a matrix @xmath38 of elementary spectator fields will be considered , as in the models of refs .",
    "@xcite , without the introduction of further mass scales .",
    "this entails a superpotential contribution of the form @xmath39 to avoid spoiling the iss vacuum , in which @xmath18 acquires nonzero f - terms along the diagonal , @xmath38 is taken as a traceless matrix . if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are chosen to be in a reducible representation of @xmath34 , @xmath38 can have components transforming in both vector representations of this group along diagonal blocks and chiral ones along off - diagonal blocks .",
    "finally , in models of supersymmetry breaking based upon iss vacua and aiming to explain gaugino masses , it is necessary to introduce an explicit source of violation of r - symmetry .",
    "we will follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and add the following contribution to the superpotential : @xmath40 throughout the rest of the paper it will assumed that the khler potential for the fields is canonical ; this is justified since the models considered arise as weakly coupled infrared descriptions of the strongly coupled electric theories .",
    "this section provides a brief review of the vacuum configurations of models without r - symmetry breaking , with superpotential of the form @xmath41 where the different terms are given in eqs .  , and .",
    "the superpotential of eq .",
    "admits supersymmetric configurations , thanks to the nonperturbative contributions .",
    "these are @xcite    @xmath42    with the rest of the fields having zero vevs .      ignoring the nonperturbative contributions @xmath43 to the superpotential , which can be done when the fields take values near the origin , the iss model breaks supersymmetry due to the rank condition : @xmath44 because the two terms in the sum do not have the same rank ; at most one cancel @xmath45 f - terms .",
    "thus , supersymmetry is broken . decomposing the meson and magnetic quarks in the following way , @xmath46 @xmath47",
    "then the resulting iss vacuum is characterized by nonzero f - terms @xmath48 , with @xmath49 and the rest of the fields having zero vevs .",
    "the tree - level vacuum energy is @xmath50 to lowest order , @xmath51 is a pseudomodulus , but it is stabilized at the origin by one - loop quantum corrections @xcite . it should be emphasized that all field directions , including the goldstone modes associated with the global symmetries broken by the configuration of eq .  , are stabilized once one gauges the global u(1 ) symmetry of the model @xcite .",
    "thus , the decays to other vacua can only proceed through tunneling ( as long as the q - balls of ref .",
    "@xcite are made unstable , as commented in the introduction ) .      as was motivated before",
    ", the spectator fields can be embedded into a traceless matrix .",
    "they are used to lift some mesons included in the field @xmath51 of eq .  , which are light in the iss vacuum ; thus , @xmath38 only couples to @xmath51 .",
    "taking into account the spectator couplings , and ignoring again nonperturbative contributions to the superpotential , instead of eq .",
    "one has @xmath52 the rank condition applies as before to the fields @xmath53 but not to @xmath54 ; one can use the spectators to cancel more f - terms than in the iss vacuum . @xcite .",
    "one can then consider vevs for both off - diagonal as well as diagonal components of the spectator fields . in the case of diagonal vevs ,",
    "if @xmath38 is an @xmath55 traceless matrix coupling to an @xmath55 block @xmath56 of the meson field , one can use @xmath57 diagonal elements to cancel as many f - terms of @xmath56 , and then the uncancelled f - term can be made zero by giving a vev to a pair of components of the @xmath58 fields .",
    "this in turn requires to set one component of @xmath59 to zero in order not to turn on some components of @xmath60 .",
    "the new vacuum is @xcite @xmath61 whose tree - level energy is @xmath62 i.e. , lower than the energy of the iss vacuum . in this vacuum , @xmath63 as well as the components of @xmath51 that do not couple to spectators are tree - level flat directions ; again , they are stabilized by quantum corrections .",
    "regarding vacua with vevs for off - diagonal spectators , one may distinguish two cases .",
    "the first case is that in which off - diagonal spectator fields come in conjugate pairs .",
    "this allows again to cancel more f - terms than the @xmath64 ones allowed by the rank condition for the iss vacuum .",
    "considering @xmath65 as @xmath66 matrices , one can give identical vevs to multiple rows of @xmath65 ; this allows to cancel the diagonal f - terms in eq .   but generates symmetric off - diagonal contributions , which can be compensated in turn by giving vevs to off - diagonal spectators .",
    "the f - term conditions for @xmath60 then force to set to zero one linear combination of the rows of the @xmath67 matrix of vevs of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "hence , if one cancels @xmath70 f - terms along @xmath51 , one needs to give vevs to @xmath70 rows of @xmath65 as well as @xmath71 pairs of off - diagonal spectators ; the resulting vacuum energy is again that of eq .  .",
    "alternatively , one can have off - diagonal spectators that are not accompanied by their conjugates .",
    "again , one can cancel the diagonal f - terms of @xmath51 as in the previous paragraph by giving vevs to the @xmath54 fields , which generates the same pairs of off - diagonal contributions to @xmath72 . for each of these pairs , one can cancel one of the f - terms by giving a vev to an off - diagonal spectator field ; since it is assumed that the spectators do not come in conjugate pairs , there will remain a nonzero off - diagonal contribution , @xmath73 . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the resulting vacuum configurations have a runaway towards vacua with energy as in eq .  .",
    "to see this , consider the cancellation of a pair of diagonal components of @xmath74 , say @xmath75 and @xmath76 , by choosing @xmath77 an off - diagonal spectator @xmath78 can be given a vev to cancel @xmath79 ; then @xmath80 is in principle nonzero but can be minimized by taking either @xmath81 or @xmath82 to zero , which by virtue of implies that either @xmath83 or @xmath84 must approach infinity , which generates a runaway .    at this point",
    "it should be clear that the tunneling from the iss vacuum towards the vacua of this section should proceed preferably towards those involving spectators along the diagonal , either because they are closer to the iss vacuum or because the decay involves a smaller number of tunneling directions .",
    "for this reason the numerical estimates in  [ sec : numerics ] center on the case of diagonal spectators .",
    "this section is dedicated to the vacuum configurations in the presence of r - symmetry breaking interactions coming from the superpotential contribution of eq .",
    ", so that the total superpotential is of the form @xmath85 where the different terms are given in eqs .  , , and .    in this case",
    ", the violation of r - symmetry gives rise to susy - vacua near the origin , as expected from the results of ref .",
    "these vacua are given by @xmath86    if the r - symmetry breaking deformation @xmath87 of the superpotential is small , it is expected that there will be vacuum configurations deforming the iss vacuum of  [ subsec : iss ] .",
    "this turns out to be the case indeed ; although at tree - level the pseudomodulus field @xmath51 of the iss model becomes unstable , one - loop quantum corrections stabilize it at a nonzero vev , so that the new vacuum becomes @xcite @xmath88",
    "analogously , the vacua involving spectator fields also survive the @xmath3 deformation ; in this case the pseudomodulus field @xmath63 gets a nonzero vev due to quantum corrections , of the same order as @xmath51 in eq .  .",
    "more details about the coleman - weinberg potential responsible for these quantum corrections are given in ",
    "[ app : vcw ] .",
    "in order to estimate the decay rates of the iss vacuum towards the supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric vacua describe above , the semiclassical approach of coleman @xcite will be followed . in this approach , the lifetime of a metastable vacuum is computed from a saddlepoint evaluation of the path integral for the transition amplitude of the false vacuum onto itself after infinite time . in a theory involving a set of fields @xmath89 , the decay rate per unite volume can be written as @xcite @xmath90}{\\det[-\\box+v''(\\phi_-)]}\\right|^{-1/2}\\times ( 1+o(\\hbar ) ) , \\,\\,\\,\\,s_b = s(\\overline\\phi)-s(\\phi_-).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the previous formula , @xmath91 denotes the metastable vacuum configuration , while @xmath92 indicates the determinant with translational zero modes omitted .",
    "@xmath93 represents the semiclassical bounce configuration , which is obtained as a solution of the euclidean equations of motion with appropriate boundary conditions . with the euclidean action written as @xmath94=\\int\\ !",

    "however , this is not suited for multifield configurations .",
    "the calculations presented in this paper were done with the technique of ref .",
    "essentially , this approach contemplates the equation with a modified friction term , @xmath99 the equations for the frictionless case @xmath100 are equivalent to the equations of motion of the following one - dimensional action @xmath101.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , the bounce solution is not strictly a minimum of the above functional , but rather corresponds to a saddlepoint @xcite solutions staying closer to the true vacuum than the bounce have lower values of @xmath102 . nevertheless , by using a modified potential @xmath103 , obtained from @xmath104 by flattening out the potential energies below that of the false vacuum , it can be argued that the frictionless bounce configuration for @xmath100 ( see eq .  ) is a minimum of the functional @xmath105 obtained by substituting @xmath104 with @xmath103 in eq .",
    ", in the limit @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "@xmath103 can be taken as @xmath107 where @xmath108 designates the lower lying vacuum .",
    "the reason for this is that , for @xmath106 , the frictionless bounce has the same value of @xmath105 than field configurations joining both vacua and hence minimizing the functional ; the bounce can be obtained from them by simply eliminating the points with @xmath109 , whose contribution to the action vanishes for @xmath106 .",
    "once the solution of eq .   for",
    "@xmath100 has been obtained via a minimization procedure , the sought for solution corresponding to @xmath110 can be obtained iteratively in incremental steps in @xmath111 by solving a finite - difference version of eq .   with a linearized gradient of the potential .",
    "discretizing the @xmath112 variable as an @xmath113 point lattice @xmath114 and denoting @xmath115 , the linearized equation for a given value of @xmath111 and a previous estimation @xmath116 of the solution is @xmath117 which can be easily inverted .",
    "@xmath118 is an offset parameter introduced to avoid pathological behavior near @xmath119 , which eventually has to be driven to zero . in the computations presented here , the iterations were performed with increasing number of steps in @xmath111 until the successive values of the bounce action differed in less than a few percent .    in the previous formulae ,",
    "@xmath120 is in principle meant to be the tree - level potential .",
    "however , when the higher energy vacuum is only stabilized after taking into account quantum corrections as happens in the @xmath3 deformation of the iss vacuum there will be no bounce solution to eq .  .",
    "an obvious way out is to substitute the tree - level potential by the perturbative quantum effective potential @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "this approach is correct as long as the effect of higher derivatives terms or field renormalizations can be ignored ; to take these into account , and to avoid problems with imaginary values of the effective potential , a modified formalism is needed , such as the one described in ref .  @xcite . to leading order",
    "both approaches are expected to be equivalent ; therefore in the computations presented here it was proceeded by simply using the one - loop effective potential , which was obtained by evaluating the coleman - weinberg potential for arbitrary background values of the fields , as detailed in  [ app : vcw ] .",
    "the numerical method summarized above allows to compute the bounce action @xmath122 in eq .  .",
    "the calculation of the prefactor is a much more daunting task ; however , since the bounce action enters exponentially , its contribution is dominant .",
    "the prefactor can be estimated as an appropriate power of the most relevant scale in the potential ; with scales of the order of 200 tev the typical mass scale for the fields @xmath123 in phenomenological models of direct mediation based on the iss model , then a bounce action of the order @xmath124 ( in natural units ) is enough to guarantee a lifetime of the order of the age of the universe .",
    "since the action of the bounce configuration is dimensionless in natural units , it depends only on dimensionless couplings or ratios of the scales in the potential .",
    "thus , it is desirable to perform the computations using dimensionless variables .",
    "this not only might help avoid numerical fluctuations in the presence of very different mass scales , but also allows to reach qualitative conclusions about the dependence of the bounce action on the dimensionless quantities .",
    "the parameters in the superpotentials of eqs .  , , and are the dimensionless couplings @xmath125 and the scales @xmath126 . from these we can define dimensionless scale ratios and fields , as well as a dimensionless radial variable and potential ,",

    "suppose that one can single out a coupling @xmath130 such that @xmath131 is of order one .",
    "rescaling the radial variable @xmath132 , the bounce action is @xmath133,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integrand is expected to be of order one , so that the bounce action will scale like @xmath134 .    in the case of decays from the iss vacuum ,",
    "generically @xmath9 is assumed to be of order one ; since it appears in the f - terms and the masses of the messenger fields , it can not be made too small in phenomenologically acceptable models .",
    "the parameters which can be made small are @xmath135 and @xmath136 , which are expected to determine the decay rates towards the susy vacua .",
    "this is so because both parameters appear in the superpotential contributions @xmath43 and @xmath137 of eqs .   and , which are responsible for the existence of the susy vacua of  [ subsec : vacua : r ] and  [ subsec : vacua : nonr ] .",
    "these superpotentials give rise to terms with positive powers of @xmath136 and @xmath138 in the potential , and the discussion in the previous paragraph applies .",
    "thus , the bounce action is expected to be parametrically large for small values of these ratios of scales , which guarantees a parametrically small decay rate .",
    "the same conclusions were achieved in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite using more detailed arguments based on one - dimensional tunneling with a triangular potential barrier , which yielded analytic estimates for the scaling . ref .",
    "@xcite argued that the bounce action associated with the decay towards the nonperturbative susy vacua should behave as @xmath139 while in ref .",
    "@xcite the bounce action corresponding to the decay towards the susy vacua in the presence of r - symmetry breaking was estimated , in the limit @xmath140 as @xmath141 the next section will present numerical results which confirm the qualitative behavior and the scaling of eq .  . regarding the decays to susy vacua in the presence of r - symmetry breaking , numerical fluctuations prevented to probe the regime @xmath140 for which eq .",
    "still , a phenomenologically relevant range of parameters could be studied ; the obtained scaling is different from eq .  , but it is still an open question whether the latter is valid or receives corrections due to the failure of the one - dimensional triangular barrier approximation .",
    "regarding the decays from the iss vacuum to the vacua involving spectator fields , the situation seems less clear . from the scale ratios ,",
    "only @xmath135 will be relevant , since it influences the tunneling along the fields @xmath51 and @xmath63 , whose vevs are controlled by @xmath5 .",
    "however , it is hard to guess how dominant the @xmath5-dependent pieces in the potential are in comparison with other terms , and if at all , the decay rate is expected to increase for growing @xmath5 , since the difference between the vevs in the iss and spectator vacua grows with @xmath5 .",
    "concerning @xmath142 and @xmath143 , although they control the interaction with the spectator fields , typically one has @xmath144 , which implies that the vevs of the spectator fields will be very small see eq .  ; thus the contribution of their kinetic energy to the bounce action will be subdominant , and their profile in the bounce configuration will be approximately that which minimizes the potential for the rest of the fields at any given point in the bounce trajectory .",
    "the value of the potential at these minima wo nt be affected by changes of @xmath145 , and so they will have a weak influence in the final value for the bounce action .",
    "thus , one expects that the latter will be mainly determined by the remaining dimensionless parameter @xmath9 , which as said before can not be made parametrically small for phenomenological reasons .",
    "therefore , a more detailed numerical evaluation is needed in order to elucidate whether sufficiently long lifetimes can be achieved for phenomenologically acceptable values of the parameters .",
    "the following sections present the results of the numerical evaluations of the bounce configurations and their actions .",
    "given the preceding discussion , the computations are done for different values of @xmath146 and @xmath9 , keeping fixed @xmath147 as well as @xmath148 and @xmath149 .      this section presents the results for the numerical evaluation of the bounce action associated with transitions from the iss to the susy vacua generated by nonperturbative interactions , in the case @xmath150 .",
    "both vacua differ in the vevs of the fields @xmath51 , @xmath63 , @xmath53 ; in both of them one can choose @xmath151 , which will be respected by the evolution under the equations of motion of the bounce . turning on other fields",
    "apart from the above will increase the potential energy by turning on additional f - terms ; thus the bounce configuration will only involve nontrivial profiles for three fields : @xmath51 , @xmath63 and @xmath152 .",
    "the parameters in the superpotential are taken as real , which allows to only consider tunneling along the real parts of the above fields ; furthermore , @xmath51 is treated as a diagonal field , @xmath153 . in order to solve for the bounce configuration with the technique of  [ subsec : numerics : gen ] , the fields have to be rescaled so that their kinetic terms are canonical as in eq .  ;",
    "thus , the following redefinitions are introduced , @xmath154 the bounce action was computed for different values of the parameter @xmath143 , which according to the discussion in the previous section should largely determine the decay rate .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , which confirms the parametric dependence in @xmath143 , with exponent equal to 2.6 .",
    "this confirms the analytical result of eq .  , which for the choice of parameters here yields an exponent of 2.4 .",
    "the results show that the normalization is such that even for moderate values of @xmath143 the lifetimes are much bigger than the age of the universe , @xmath155 .",
    "one of the resulting multifield bounce configurations is shown on fig .",

    "this is only relevant when considering decays from the iss vacuum to spectator vacua , but it is a good approximation due to the fact that the bounce configurations exit the barrier close to the iss vacuum , in which the field components of the superfield @xmath51 have a supersymmetric tree - level mass matrix .    the one - loop coleman - weinberg potential at a scale @xmath195 in the @xmath187 scheme can be written as @xmath196 where @xmath197 for vector , fermions and scalars , respectively , and @xmath198 are the corresponding field - dependent mass eigenvalues in a proper normalization of the fields . as justified in the discussion above , we include the following degrees of freedom :      the mass eigenvalues in eq",
