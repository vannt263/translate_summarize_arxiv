    "the soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) are a subclass of the low  mass x  ray binaries in which a low  mass star transfers material to a neutron star or black hole .",
    "they undergo large outbursts , reaching x ",
    "ray luminosities of order the eddington limit ( see tanaka & lewin 1995 and tanaka & shibazaki 1996 for reviews ) .",
    "the outbursts have similarities to those of dwarf novae , but with important differences , one being that the timescales are much longer ; a dwarf nova outburst lasts a few days and typically recurs every few weeks , whereas in sxts the corresponding timescales are months and years .",
    "it is generally accepted that the dwarf nova outburst results from a thermal  viscous instability in the accretion disc ( see cannizzo 1993 for a review ) . to some extent the models used for dwarf novae can reproduce the correct timescales for the sxt outburst , but only by reducing the viscosity parameter by a factor of 10100 and choosing a particular functional form for it ( e.g. cannizzo , chen & livio , 1995 ) .",
    "although there are similarities between the discs during outburst in dwarf novae and sxts , an important observed difference is that the discs in the sxts are heavily irradiated by the central x  ray source ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ; shahbaz & kuulkers 1998 ) .",
    "recently king & ritter ( 1998 ) have pointed out that irradiation prolongs the entire sxt outburst cycle , forcing sxt light curves to have long exponential or linear tails , because the outburst can only shut off through the viscous decay of the central accretion , rather than via a cooling front as is the case in dwarf novae .",
    "( for counterarguments see cannizzo 1998 . ) in this paper we apply some of the key features of the kr irradiation model to the x  ray light curves of sxts .",
    "kr show that the light curves of sxts can be explained by a disc instability model , modified to take account of irradiation by the central x  ray source during the outburst .",
    "irradiation prevents the disc returning to the cool state until the central accretion rate is sharply reduced .",
    "if irradiation is strong enough to ionize all of the disc out to its edge , kr show that the x  ray light curve will be a roughly exponential decay , with most of the disc mass being accreted on a viscous timescale .",
    "the recurrence time to the next outburst will be long , as the disc has to be rebuilt by mass transfer from the companion star .",
    "if instead the x - rays are too weak to ionize the whole disc , kr show that the x  ray light curve should be a roughly linear decline , returning to quiescence after a viscous timescale . in this case",
    "much of the disc mass is not accreted , allowing the next outburst to begin after a shorter recurrence time than if there had been an exponential x ",
    "ray decay .",
    "kr give expressions for the critical central accretion rates required to ionize the disc out to a given radius @xmath1 .",
    "there are two rates , depending on whether the central source is point  like or disc  like . in the second case irradiation",
    "is weaker by a typical factor @xmath4 , since a disc  like source is foreshortened by this factor as seen by matter at the disc surface . as a result the critical accretion rate ( and thus luminosity ) is higher by a factor @xmath13 than in the point  like case .",
    "the critical rates ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) of kr are equivalent to critical luminosities    @xmath14    @xmath15    here @xmath16 is the ionized disc radius @xmath1 in units of @xmath17  cm .",
    "the maximum possible value of the outer disc radius , and hence the radius @xmath1 of the ionized region , is given by the tidal radius @xmath18 of the disc ( we use 80 per cent of the roche lobe of the primary in the applications in this paper , but it should be noted that the fraction can vary between 70 and 90 per cent ) . if the accretor is a neutron star it must behave as a point  like source , as its surface will be heated by accretion . if the accretor is a black hole it is possible for it to behave as a disc  like accretor ( the relevant formulae were labelled ` ns ' , ` bh ' in kr ) .",
    "indeed this effect probably accounts for the very strong tendency of black  hole systems with low ",
    "mass companion stars to be transient ( king , kolb & szuszkiewicz , 1997 ) : the _ mean _ mass transfer rate @xmath19 lies below @xmath20(disc  like ) for all black  hole systems , almost irrespective of the nature of the companion star , so that a persistent state with a stably irradiated disc is impossible for them .",
    "however , during outbursts , all transients develop a hard power  law x  ray component which is very probably a central x - ray corona , in addition to the softer blackbody  like component which probably comes from the disc .",
    "thus it is likely that even black  hole accretors become point  like x  ray sources during sxt outbursts , making @xmath20(point  like ) given by ( [ pt ] ) the correct formula to use during the outburst .",
    "this is the procedure adopted in this paper ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . note that the use of @xmath20(point  like ) during outbursts and @xmath20(disc  like ) for the mean behaviour is consistent , provided that the power  law coronal component becomes weaker than the blackbody component once the central accretion rate @xmath21 declines below the mean mass transfer rate @xmath19 near the end of an outburst .",
    "equipped with the appropriate value of @xmath20 , we can now predict the form of the light curve decay .",
    "if the observed peak x  ray luminosity is less than the value of @xmath22 corresponding to its outer radius , the outer edge of the disc is not strongly irradiated and the decay will be linear . if however the observed luminosity is greater than this critical luminosity , it is strong enough to ionize the outer parts of the disc and the decay will initially be exponential .",
    "both kinds of decay are observed .      in a linear decay the x ",
    "ray luminosity obeys    @xmath23 . \\label{lin}\\ ] ]    ( using eqn 23 of kr ) , where the decay started at time @xmath24 .",
    "here @xmath25 is the kinematic viscosity near the edge of the heating front , @xmath26 is the heated mass at the start of the outburst ( peak luminosity ) , and    @xmath27    thus the peak value @xmath28 of @xmath29 is given by setting @xmath24 , and gives    @xmath30    defining @xmath31 as the time for @xmath29 to fall by a factor 2 we get    @xmath32    combining these two relations and measuring @xmath31 in days we find    @xmath33    and    @xmath34    thus given the peak x  ray luminosity and the time taken for the flux to drop by a factor 2 we can determine the ionized disc mass at the start of the outburst and the disc viscosity . since for a linear decay @xmath29 lies below the critical value which would ionize the whole disc ( by definition ) , the radius of the ionized disc at the start of the outburst is given by    @xmath35    a linear decay in an sxt implies that the ratio @xmath36(outer disc radius)@xmath37 is smaller than a critical value .",
    "this can happen either because ( a ) the central x",
    " rays are weaker than usual , or ( b ) the disc is very extended , which in turn requires the tidal radius @xmath18 to allow a large disc radius .",
    "case ( a ) is seen in aql x1 ( see section 4.1 ) ; the 19hr period means a relatively small disc , but the x  ray luminosity only reaches peak values @xmath38  erg  s@xmath39 .",
    "case ( b ) must apply in sufficiently long  period binaries : the disc can not be smaller than the circularization radius , which increases with orbital period , while the x  ray luminosity can not greatly exceed the eddington limit .",
    "an example is grs 174463 , ( p = 11.8 days ; the longest period of any sxt ) which is linear right from the start of the observed outburst decline ( @xmath40 cf @xmath41 ) .      for systems in which the peak x ",
    "ray luminosity is strong enough to keep the whole disc in a hot state , kr show that the x ",
    "rays decrease exponentially , i.e.    @xmath42    where @xmath43  g  @xmath44 , @xmath12 is the ratio of the disc mass at the start of the outburst to the maximum possible , and    @xmath45    we can fit the form of ( [ exp ] ) at @xmath46=0 to the observed x  ray light curve , to give the normalisation of the light curve and the decay time allows one to determine @xmath25 and @xmath1 . from ( [ exp ] ) at @xmath46=0 we get    @xmath47    and combining this equation with ( [ tau ] ) gives    @xmath48    and    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is @xmath51 measured in days .    equation ( [ exp ] ) is equivalent to the statement that the hot disc mass @xmath52 decays exponentially on the viscous timescale @xmath51 , i.e.    @xmath53    ( cf eqn 4 of kr ) , so the total heated mass at the start of the outburst is    @xmath54    note that this equation is very similar to equation ( [ ml ] ) , i.e. the mass of the hot disc in the linear case . combining",
    "the first form of this equation with equations ( [ p ] ) and ( [ tau ] ) shows that the heated mass at the start of the outburst is    @xmath55    the maximum possible value of this mass is given by assuming that the disc has the critical density everywhere ( @xmath56 ) , and that its outer radius has the largest possible size , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "this gives    @xmath58    where @xmath59  g  @xmath44 and @xmath18 the tidal radius . since the latter quantity is a function of binary parameters ,",
    "this value can be compared with the observational estimate ( [ mh ] ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the monotonic decay of x  ray / optical light curves of many of the sxts are often interrupted by a flux increase of a factor of 2 or more over a timescale @xmath60  d , followed by the resumption of the normal decay .",
    "the secondary maximum has predominantly been seen in the bh sxts . however , it should be noted that a closer inspection of the x  ray light curves of cen x4 ( kaluzienski et al .",
    "1980 ) , aql x1 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) and gro  j1744 - 28 ( kouveliotou & van paradijs 1998 ) also show similar secondary maxima . note that gro  j1655 - 40 is the only bh sxt that shows a linear decay ( see fig .",
    "we define the time in days after the outburst peak that the secondary maxima occurs as @xmath2 . as kr point out , these secondary maxima features may be caused by material in the outer disc triggering small outbursts during the linear decay phase .",
    "a related idea is simply that the increase in viscosity when irradiation begins is more marked in the outer regions than further in , causing a ` pulse ' of extra mass to move inwards . in both cases",
    "the secondary maximum should appear one irradiated ",
    "state viscous time after the initial outburst . in table 2",
    "we determine @xmath2 and @xmath61 for those sxts in which the secondary maximum has been observed , which we plot in fig .",
    "5 . note that all data points from exponential decays lie in a straight line , whereas the data from linear decays are systematically higher .",
    "this may suggest that there is a different relation for linear decays , which may not be so surprising as one would expect the density wave to behave differently depending on whether or not it started in the outermost part of the original disc",
    ". only more observations of linear decays with secondary maxima will resolve this .",
    "a least squares linear fit to the data points from exponential decays gives    @xmath62    where the fit has a correlation coefficient of 0.92 and 1@xmath63 errors are given ( a constant term in the fit is only significant at the 34 percent confidence level ) .",
    "i.e. this fit is consistent with the physical requirement that it pass through the origin .",
    "thus given a complete x  ray outburst of a sxt then @xmath2 is determined by the observation of a secondary maximum .",
    "this can then be used in eqn .",
    "( [ rad ] ) to predict the peak luminosity of the outburst .",
    "the distance to the source ( @xmath64 ) can then be determined given the observed peak x  ray flux @xmath8 .",
    "thus for exponential decays we obtain    @xmath65      the gradient of the @xmath0 versus @xmath2 fit is related to the rate with which @xmath0 decreases , i.e. the speed of the density wave producing the secondary maxima .",
    "the speed of this wave is given by the radial drift velocity    @xmath66    where @xmath3 is the accretion disc viscosity parameter , @xmath67 is the equatorial  plane sound speed in the hot gas and @xmath68 is the disc scale height at disc radius @xmath69 . for an irradiated disc the temperature at the edge of the density wave",
    "is given by    @xmath70    ( van paradijs 1996 ) which then gives @xmath67 .",
    "we find a mean @xmath67 of 1.0@xmath71  cm  s@xmath39 ( see table 2 ) , in line with our expectation that the outer region of the disc must be close to but just above the ionization temperature @xmath72  k. > from the gradient of eqn .",
    "( [ fit ] ) we find @xmath73 = 1.5@xmath74  cm  s@xmath39 , implying that the average aspect ratio and viscosity parameter for sxts in outburst have orders of magnitude such that @xmath75 a typical high  state value for @xmath3 is of order 0.1 , so this result is consistent with the expected aspect ratio @xmath76 of the outbursting disc .      the 1974 november x  ray outburst light curve of tra x1 is best fitted with an exponential decay ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . there is a secondary maximum present @xmath77 52 days after the outburst peak ; the peak observed flux is @xmath78  ergs  s@xmath39  @xmath79 and @xmath9=57.4 days .",
    "using equation ( [ d ] ) below we estimate @xmath64=16 and 12 for the neutron star and black hole cases respectively .    using the lower limit to the distance",
    "we can estimate the absolute magnitude of the secondary star . given @xmath80 and @xmath81 mags ( csl )",
    "we find @xmath82 + 3.2 .",
    "the secondary star is either a main sequence star later than f or a subgiant later than k5 ; the latter seems to be more probable .",

    "ray outburst light curve of the x - ray pulsar / transient sax  j1808.43658 is best fitted with an exponential decay ( see fig .",
    "there is also a secondary maximum present @xmath77 13 days after the outburst peak .",
    "given the observed peak flux @xmath83  ergs  s@xmath39  @xmath79 ( gilfanov et al . 1998 ) and @xmath9=8.4 days , using equation ( [ d ] ) we estimate the distance to be 5.5 kpc , assuming @xmath12=1.0 . however , if @xmath12=0.5 , then the we obtain 3.9 kpc which agrees very well with the distance estimate obtained from assuming that the type @xmath84 x - ray burst was eddingtion limited ( int zand et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we have shown that the x  ray light curves of soft x ",
    "ray transients are divided into exponential or linear according as their peak luminosities lie above or below the critical value which can maintain the outer disc in the hot state .",
    "this is as expected in the model of king and ritter ( 1998 ) for transient outbursts .",
    "we were also able to estimate the radius and mass of the heated disc region .",
