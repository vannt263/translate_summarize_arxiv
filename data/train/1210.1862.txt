    "the disordered pinning model has attracted significant attention in recent years .",
    "one reason is that it is one of the very few models where the effect of disorder on the critical properties can be identified with large precision .",
    "in particular , there exists a fairly satisfactory knowledge on whether and how much the critical point , which separates its localized and delocalized regime , changes under the presence of disorder @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mechanism that defines it is present in multiple physical models , and therefore it provides a step to understand the effect of disorder in more complicated systems  we refer to the recent monograph @xcite for related references .    before going into detail",
    "let us define the model .",
    "we first consider a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "variables @xmath0 , which play the role of disorder .",
    "the assumptions on this sequence are in general mild , for example , mean zero and exponential moments . we denote the joint distribution of this sequence by @xmath1 .",
    "the model involves also a renewal sequence @xmath2 on @xmath3 , that is , a point process such that the gaps ( or interarrival times ) @xmath4 are independent and identically distributed .",
    "this renewal process should be viewed physically as the set of contact points with @xmath5 of the space - time trajectory of a markov process @xmath6 whose state space contains a designated site 0 , with this trajectory representing the spatial configuration of the polymer .",
    "since the interaction between the markov process and the disorder comes only at contact times with @xmath7 , the only relevant information is the renewal sequence @xmath8 , consisting of the contact points of the path @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "therefore we only need to define the statistics of this renewal process , whose law we will denote by @xmath9 . in particular , we define @xmath10 and assume that for some @xmath11 and slowly varying function  @xmath12 , @xmath13 we will assume that @xmath14 , that is , that the renewal is recurrent .",
    "we will  also need the quantity @xmath15 .",
    "the polymer measure can now be defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the partition function @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20.\\ ] ] the polymer measure rewards paths for which the @xmath21 values are large at the times of renewals .",
    "it will also be useful to consider the constrained polymer measure @xmath22 where we restrict the polymer to have a renewal at time @xmath23 . here",
    "the constrained partition function is @xmath24.\\ ] ] more generally for a collection @xmath25 of trajectories we define @xmath26.\\ ] ] we will also need the notation @xmath27,\\omega } = z^{\\beta , h}_{n - m,\\theta_{m}\\omega } , \\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , for @xmath30 .    as already mentioned , the pinning polymer exhibits a nontrivial localization / delocalization transition , which is often quantified via the strict positivity of the free energy .",
    "to be more precise , let us define the quenched free energy of the pinning polymer to be the @xmath1-a.s .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , chapter  3 , for the existence of this limit .",
    "the localized regime is defined as @xmath32 and the delocalized regime as @xmath33 the free energy is monotone in @xmath34 so the two regimes are separated by a critical line and we can define the quenched critical point @xmath35 as @xmath36 let @xmath37 $ ] be the moment generating function of @xmath38 . for the corresponding annealed model , with partition function @xmath39 and free energy @xmath40 the corresponding critical point is @xmath41",
    "the question of the path behavior of the quenched model for @xmath42 is of particular interest when @xmath43 , so we summarize what has been proved about such an inequality .",
    "it is known from  @xcite ( for gaussian disorder ) and from  @xcite ( for general disorder ) that for small @xmath44 , @xmath45 , for @xmath46 as well as for @xmath47 and @xmath48 . on the other hand , from for gaussian disorder , for @xmath49 , there exists a constant @xmath50 and a slowly varying function @xmath51 related to @xmath52 and @xmath53 such that for all small @xmath44 , @xmath54 while for @xmath55 , @xmath56 a matching upper bound is also expected to hold but has not been proved . for @xmath57 , @xmath58 the case @xmath47 is marginal and not fully understood . it is believed that @xmath59 for every @xmath44 , as long as @xmath60 .",
    "this inequality has been confirmed under some stronger hypotheses in @xcite , for gaussian disorder , and ( most nearly optimally , for general disorder ) in @xcite . for all @xmath61 , for large @xmath44",
    "the critical points are shown in @xcite to be distinct provided the disorder is unbounded , but for @xmath62 they are equal for all @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "theorem 1.5 of @xcite shows that for @xmath64 the critical points are different for all values of @xmath63 .",
    "the use of the terms localization / delocalization can be understood better by relating the quenched free energy to the portion of time the polymer spends on the defect line @xmath65 .",
    "in particular , from @xcite , @xmath66 is differentiable for all @xmath67 with @xmath68,\\ ] ] and therefore we can interpret the localized regime as the regime where the polymer spends a positive fraction of time on the defect line , while in the delocalized regime it spends a zero fraction of time on the defect line . while this is quite satisfactory in the localized regime , and further detailed studies on the path properties in the localized regime have been made in @xcite , it provides a rather incomplete picture in the delocalized one  it only allows one to conclude that the number of contacts is @xmath69 .",
    "it was proven in @xcite that the number of contacts is at most of order @xmath70 in the delocalized regime .",
    "this was actually done for the related copolymer model , but its extension to the pinning model is straightforward @xcite .",
    "more precisely , for every @xmath42 , there exists a constant @xmath71 such that @xmath72\\bigr|>c_{\\beta , h}\\log n \\bigr)=0.\\ ] ] this result was further extended to an a.s .",

    "nevertheless , the picture has been unclear in the disordered case , since stretches of unusual disorder values could typically attract the polymer back to the defect line a number of times growing to infinity with @xmath23 .",
    "the open questions are discussed in @xcite , section  8.5 . in this work",
    "we clarify and complete the picture for behavior in probability .",
    "in fact , we will prove a stronger result , namely , that the last contact of the polymer happens at distance @xmath75 from the origin . in particular ,",

    "the path behavior in the regime of theorem [ longreturns ] is therefore in contrast with that for @xmath104 , where , in fact , the number of contacts remains tight for the measures averaged over the disorder ; see @xcite , remark 1.5 .",
