    "the optimistic situation during the years before the crisis in the second half of 2008 had trended from simple , marked to marked liquid products to progressively more complex and illiquid products which were marked to model .",
    "although the degree of exoticity of products increased , they were still priced under considerably simple modeling assumptions .",
    "this led to a lot of reasonable but already limited variations of pricing models which in the very end were priced under refined assumptions of simple models such as black - scholes , hull - white , gaussian copula and so on .",
    "wrong use of these simple models was one of the reasons which led to the 2008 crisis .",
    "after the crisis the trend has evolved toward less exotic and more liquid products valued under more complex pricing assumptions .",
    "however , there is still a big concern about model risk and an increasing trend toward provision or reserve calculation as an internal policy of the financial institution .",
    "markets such as foreign exchange continue trading liquidly first generation barrier products ( barrier call / put , touch and no - touch options ) which still exhibit a considerable model risk uncertainty .",
    "this means that although products are getting simpler , model risk estimation will be from now on a big concern anyway . before the crisis",
    ", this first generation of fx exotic products were valued with the volga - vanna ( vv ) model ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this is a heuristic analytical model based on the black scholes price with a smile correction given by the price difference of a portfolio of three vanilla options valued with smile and at - the - money volatilities .",
    "this portfolio of vanilla options is calculated to match the vega ( @xmath0 ) , vanna ( @xmath1 ) and volga ( @xmath2 ) of the barrier black - scholes price ( @xmath3 ) with at - the - money volatility .",
    "it has been justified ( see @xcite ) that this model provides accurate results for non - path - dependent options ( e.g. quanto options ) . however , nothing could be concluded for path - dependent options such as barriers .",
    "a provision calculation philosophy should cover the expected hedging loss plus some of the uncertainty of that loss .",
    "some characteristics of a good provision policy is the fact that they should be transparent and easy to compute ( so that both front office and risk department can calculate them easily )",
    ". they should be dynamic ( change through time ) and stable with a smooth decreasing evolution as expiry approaches ( the closer to expiry the less uncertainty and therefore the less model risk provision ) . from a management perspective , provisions should balance risk mitigation with business limitation .",
    "this means that they can provide the means to approve marketing derivative products to customers using limited models with controllable risk .",
    "for instance , if a deal can be valued with a slow but accurate model but the number of deals is huge , product marketing could be approved with a simpler less accurate model if the appropriate provision is applied .",
    "in addition , provisions introduce an incentive to improve models .",
    "a less accurate model may be charged a high provision so that when it gets improved , the provision is reduced .",
    "model risk can arise out of many different sources of uncertainty : unrealistic model hypothesis , inaccurate calibration , different calibration strategies , different sets of calibration products or externally input parameters which are not calibrated to market ( e.g. correlations , dividends , mean reversion ) .",
    "therefore , model risk could be estimated on a deal - by - deal basis by calculating sets of prices varying these sources of uncertainty .",
    "for example , a set of prices can be calculated varying one or more of these sources of uncertainty : model hypothesis ( e.g. change mean reversion , correlations or evaluate same deal with different models ) , calibration sets , calibration strategies or externally - input parameters not calibrated to market .",
    "this set of prices gives an interval which could be interpreted as a bid - offer spread ( this bid - offer spread would be theoretically composed by the set of arbitrage - free prices according to the arbitrage free measures given by all possible underlying hypotheses or `` models '' ) .",
    "the absolute value of the difference between the highest price ( offer side ) and the lowest price ( bid side ) would give an estimate for model risk for a single deal .",
    "the key question now would be which parameters to change and how much they should be changed .",
    "in addition , this strategy is usually carried out on a deal - by - deal basis and portfolio diversification is not considered .",
    "furthermore , each product may have its own way of estimating model risk . in this context , the provision would be a fraction or multiplier of this model risk quantity . through this approach , the senior management can clearly define their risk profile .",
    "this `` absolute '' way of measuring model risk is formalized and analyzed in a systematic way by @xcite . in this reference ,",
    "a given product is valued under different arbitrage - free pricing measures which must satisfy certain properties .",
    "each measure gives a different price and all the prices are confined in an interval ( a bid - offer spread ) .",
    "the model risk measure is then defined as the difference between the offer and bid prices .",
    "this can be regarded as an `` absolute '' model risk measure , because any pricing hypothesis can virtually be considered and the interval can get progressively broader as long as more pricing measures are incorporated . in practice , only a limited number of measures can be considered ( e.g. changing unobservable market parameters , calibration sets or hypotheses of the evolution of the underlying risk factors ) .",
    "this limited number of pricing measures allow estimating model risk .",
    "the portfolio effect can be considered when the whole portfolio is priced with each measure and model risk is calculated from the bid - offer spread obtained for the whole portfolio .",
    "this paper does not address this `` absolute '' model risk approach .",
    "instead , it is concerned with a relative model risk measure of a particular product priced with a given model with respect to a reference model under which the market dynamics are assumed to be driven .",
    "the relative measure is defined by the expected shortfall at a given significance level of the hedging strategy of the product priced according to its model , assuming that the market is driven by the reference model .",
    "the advantage of the expected shortfall measure is the fact that it is coherent ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this means that it satisfies a number of properties which provide a framework to deal with model risk in a systematic way .",
    "this relative measure provides a homogeneous framework to compare products priced with different models under the same reference .",
    "the products chosen are double - no - touch and fader options , the models under analysis are volga - vanna and black - scholes and the reference model is heston .",
    "the ideal situation would be that the reference model is chosen to be a market proxy .",
    "the original motivation of this work was to have a reasonable criterion to decide from a list of models which one was the most appropriate to price and manage a product . if the risk department is worried because many double - no - touch deals are closed what would be your answer if your boss asks you : what would you use to manage these positions ?",
    "a heuristic model such as the volga - vanna or the well - known black - scholes model but without skew pricing hypothesis ?",
    "getting back to basics , simulating the hedging strategy seemed a reasonable way to answer this question .",
    "considering hedging strategies to contrast valuation models is not new ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", the main goal of this paper is to estimate relative model risk in a way which could be consistent and robust , general purpose and applicable to a portfolio of deals .",
    "the approach followed by this paper is to simulate the hedging strategy .",
    "therefore , only analytical models can be considered in practice as the computational cost is very high .",
    "that s why this study was carried out with the help of a grid of computers .",
    "two assumptions are considered for the hedging strategy .",
    "the first one assumes that the market volatility surface is driven by heston s model ( see @xcite ) calibrated to market at a given time horizon .",
    "the second one is the fact that hedging inaccuracies from using actual sensitivities provided by the pricing model or using several vanillas to hedge the movements of the volatility surface are eliminated .",
    "this is possible because market dynamics are known and the hedging ratios are calculated to hedge the two known factor which drive the market .",
    "this methodology can be applied to a single deal or a portfolio of them .",
    "every model is evaluated under the same framework and therefore , different models and products can be quantitatively compared with each other",
    ". a reasonable provision would be equal to this relative model risk measure .",
    "this method will be applied to a single deal ( double - no - touch option ) and a portfolio of fader options with the aid of a grid of computers .",
    "the first one will be valued under black scholes and volga - vanna hypothesis and the second one only using volga - vanna .    under the black - scholes @xcite framework ,",
    "i.e. the asset follows a lognormal distribution on the real world measure with drift @xmath4 , there exists a clear mapping between the real world probability @xmath5 and the risk neutral probability @xmath6 used for pricing and hedging .",
    "this is also true under dupire s framework @xcite .",
    "apart from these two models it is difficult to find other with such direct relationship .",
    "for example , merton @xcite jump diffusion model assumes that jumps are part of the firm idiosyncratic risk .",
    "since the market portfolio cancels all firm idiosyncratic risk by diversification , according to capital asset pricing model @xcite , no risk premium should be taken into account .",
    "heston @xcite model needs to assume that investors have a very particular utility function to derive the partial differential equation of the option price and find a correspondance between pricing measures @xmath5 and @xmath6 . beyond these ideal cases",
    "authors have become more and more aware that a perfect hedging might not be possible either because the market is incomplete ( a unique risk neutral probability does not exist ) or because for practical reasons traders might want to use a simpler and faster model for pricing and hedging .",
    "the former case has been extensively studied by scheweizer @xcite , contributing to the mean - variance hedging technique and zhou @xcite , embedding the problem into a `` markowitz '' type problem .",
    "the latter case has been treated by corielli @xcite using @xmath7 energy inequities for parabolic equations which allow estimating expected pricing and hedging errors between the `` true '' model and the one used by the trading desks .",
    "our work could be regarded as a practitioner approach to this latter type of problem .",
    "although heston s model has been used as `` real world probability '' it could be argued that as long as the risk department is able to provide a coherent evolution of the underlying and the vanilla options , the methodology would still hold .",
    "nevertheless , the presented methodology is not directly meant to solve the mean - variance hedging problem rather than to study for a given model developed by a front office team , how well will it behave as market conditions are stressed .",
    "the paper starts with the formulation of the hedging strategy in section [ sec : formulation ] .",
    "section [ sec : dnt ] applies the methodology to double - no - touch options valued with black scholes and volga - vanna models .",
    "section [ sec : modelriskmeasure ] defines the relative model risk measure which will allow comparing different models in the following sections .",
    "section [ sec : dnt ] applies the methodology to double - no - touch options valued with black - scholes and volga - vanna models .",
    "it is concluded that double - no - touch products have high model risk and hedging with volga - vanna is better than black - scholes .",
    "section [ sec : faders ] applies the methodology to a portfolio of forward fader options using only the volga - vanna model .",
    "it is concluded that model risk is irrelevant for this product .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] ends with some conclusions .",
    "this section presents the formulation of the hedging strategy which will be used to compare different products evaluated with different models .",
    "subsection [ sec : marketsimulation ] shows the hypothesis assumed for the market and how to calculate the hedge ratios .",
    "subsection [ sec : implementationhedging ] explains the implementation of the hedging strategy through an intuitive derivation .",
    "the rigorous derivation of the hedging strategy is presented in subsection [ sec : rigorousderivationhedging ] justifying why model risk leads to a drift in the profit or loss of the hedging strategy and quantifying it on average .",
    "the main and hardest assumption of this hedging strategy is that the market is driven by heston s process given by equation ( [ eq : marketprocess ] ) , where @xmath8 is the underlying spot price at time @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the time - dependent domestic and foreign interest rates , @xmath12 is the variance process , @xmath13 is the long - term variance , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are correlated brownian motions with correlation @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 is the volatility of the variance process .    @xmath19    this model has two risk factors : the evolution of the underlying @xmath8 and the variance @xmath12 . therefore , on a given date , the set of model parameters ( @xmath20 , @xmath13 , @xmath18 and @xmath16 ) and these two factors completely define the market .",
    "this means that the spot and forward volatility surface ( out of vanilla and forward start call and put options ) are completely defined ( see @xcite and @xcite for a semi - analytical implementation of heston s pricing for spot and forward start vanilla options ) .",
    "this assumption that the market is driven by heston s process might not be realistic ( even if it is calibrated to market for a given horizon ) .",
    "however , it will be seen in the following sections that in spite of this fact , this hypothesis provides a framework in which different models can be compared .    under this assumption ,",
    "the evolution of the market is obtained by simulating the factors @xmath8 and @xmath12 at each point of time using a set of model parameter which were obtained calibrating the model to real market on a particular date . from these factors ,",
    "the implied volatility surface is calculated for each day and path simulated by this hypothetical market .",
    "the hedging strategy is built in order to neutralize the uncertainty of these two factors .",
    "the hedging products used are the underlying and an at - the - money 6 month vanilla call option .",
    "thus , the sensitivities of the premium of the product being hedged and the hedging products ( the 6 month vanilla option ) are calculated with respect to @xmath8 and @xmath12 as indicated by equation ( [ eq : greekdefinition ] ) , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23    the premium @xmath24 is calculated by tweaking @xmath12 , rebuilding the whole volatility surface with an initial variance @xmath25 and repricing the product with the rebuilt volatility surface ( for the 6 month vanilla it is only necessary to change the initial variance leaving heston s parameters constant ) .",
    "the same should be done for @xmath26 . however , as the fx volatility surface is expressed in terms of delta ( rather than strike ) , the volatility surface does not change when @xmath8 is varied .",
    "it is important to stress that @xmath27 is the standard fx delta ( moving the spot without changing the implied volatility surface ) .",
    "however , it would not be the standard delta in an equity context ( the surface should be rebuilt changing @xmath8 ) .",
    "concerning @xmath28 , it is clearly not the standard vega ( premium sensitivity under a parallel movement of the volatility surface ) .",
    "these sensitivities are `` external '' in the sense that they are not calculated by the pricing model itself but by the hedging algorithm to properly hedge the two factors driving the hypothetical market . in this context ,",
    "the sensitivities given by the model are ignored , only the premium is used .",
    "@xmath29    if vega sensitivities provided by the model were used to compute @xmath28 , equation ( [ eq : vega_model ] ) should be used instead of equation ( [ eq : greekdefinition ] ) , where @xmath30 is the actual vega returned by the model at different maturity and delta buckets and @xmath31 is the sensitivity of heston s implied volatility of each bucket with respect to the change of the initial variance @xmath12 . under heston s model , implied volatility movements with respect to @xmath12 have only term structure ( all delta buckets move parallel to each other ) .",
    "this means that to hedge the risk factor @xmath12 , only the term structure of vega returned by the model would be needed ( the sum of equation ( [ eq : vega_model ] ) would be only across maturities ) .",
    "if the market were represented by a mixed volatility model ( see @xcite ) , the movements of the implied volatility surface would depend on both the spot level and the initial variance and the implied volatility sensitivities with respect to the initial variance would not be equal across delta buckets . in addition , a vanna contribution @xmath32 should be added .",
    "the reason to calculate @xmath28 according to equation ( [ eq : greekdefinition ] ) instead of equation ( [ eq : vega_model ] ) is to avoid the hedging noise of the prediction error of the premium change obtained out of model sensitivities for the given movement of the implied volatility surface .",
    "however , comparing the final distribution of the hedging cost when @xmath28 is calculated according to equations ( [ eq : greekdefinition ] ) and ( [ eq : vega_model ] ) would provide a quantitative measure of the quality of the sensitivities provided by the model and their capability of predicting premium change ( this would be very useful for model validation purposes ) .",
    "see that a regular trader would only know @xmath30 ( the regular vega sensitivity provided by the model used to manage the position ) but not @xmath31 because the dynamics of the market are unknown for the trader .",
    "however , a regular trader would not use a single option ( e.g. 6 month at - the - money ) as the study presented here , but most likely three vanillas ( to account for the level , steepness and convexity of the volatility surface ) for a number of maturities . in the study presented in this paper , it is possible to hedge all movements of the volatility surface with a single vanilla because the dynamics of the market are known and therefore the movements of the volatility surface with respect to the market driving factors ( @xmath8 and @xmath12 ) . in a more realistic situation , the dynamics of the market would be unknown but several vanilla options would be used for hedging leading to a similar result .",
    "the more realistic approach is not followed here because the hedging would be worse and the purpose of this paper is to provide an estimation of the model risk premium , filtering out the imperfections of hedging with several vanillas and using the sensitivities provided by the model .",
    "comparing model risk when these imperfections are not filtered out is also very interesting but will be left for a future research .    as the foreign exchange implied volatility surface",
    "is expressed in terms of delta ( and not strike ) , it is build through an iterative method .",
    "this method starts with an initial term structure of implied volatility given by the solution of the deterministic part of the variance process ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the fx volatility surface conventions are converted into the simple black scholes setting ( spot delta , premium not included in delta , atm straddle , call and put on foreign currency ) .",
    "strikes are calculated out of the surface delta buckets and the initial term structure of implied volatility . from the strikes , vanilla call option prices",
    "are calculated according to heston s model with the given set of parameters and their implied volatilities are calculated thereafter .",
    "black scholes call deltas are then calculated out of the strikes and implied volatilities",
    ". they will not coincide with the delta buckets of the surface expressed as call option deltas .",
    "therefore , the implied volatilities of the delta buckets are interpolated from the just calculated delta versus implied volatility points and the process starts again .",
    "strikes are calculated with the new volatilities , then prices , implied volatilities and deltas which get compared with those of the buckets .",
    "the process repeats until the deltas obtained in the iteration are close enough to the delta buckets of the surface .",
    "this section presents the implementation of the hedging strategy using an intuitive derivation .",
    "the rigorous justification for continuous time will be provided in subsection [ sec : rigorousderivationhedging ] to interpret the findings of sections [ sec : dnt ] and [ sec : faders ] .",
    "consider now a portfolio @xmath34 composed by the portfolio of options to hedge @xmath35 ( this is not cash but positions on option contracts ) valued with the model under test and the hedging portfolio @xmath36 as indicated by equation ( [ eq : pitotal ] ) . equation ( [ eq : pihedgebf ] ) shows that the hedging portfolio is composed by a cash amount @xmath37 in domestic currency which will get funded , an amount of underlying @xmath38 and @xmath39 units of the 6 month vanilla call option whose price is denoted by @xmath40 .",
