    "the charge exchange process of solar wind ions with neutrals ( swcx ) is considered to contribute to the diffuse x - ray background , especially at energies under 1 kev ( @xcite ) . when solar wind ions interact with neutral atoms ( mainly h and he ) , electrons bound in the neutral",
    "are transferred to the excited state of the ion , and move to the ground state by emitting x- rays corresponding to the de - excitation energy .",
    "thus the swcx consists of emission lines , among which the o triplet at 0.57 kev is the most prominent and has been observed with x - ray ccd spectrometers on board chandra , xmm - newton and suzaku ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the swcx - induced diffuse emissions are considered to arise from collisions with neutrals of two different origins .",
    "one is the earth s geocorona , thus the emission is called `` geocoronal swcx '' . according to @xcite ,",
    "the geocorona extends with a scale height of @xmath2 @xmath3 ( earth radii ) .",
    "the other source is atoms of the local interstellar medium ( lism ) flowing into the interplanetary space ( heliosphere ) due to the relative motion of the solar system against the lism .",
    "the heliosphere extends up to @xmath4100 au from the sun @xcite , and the emission is called `` heliospheric swcx '' .",
    "the contribution of the geocoronal swcx to the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) 3/4 kev band map was pointed out by @xcite , as an enhancement characterized by variability of timescales of a few tens ks to a few days .",
    "xmm discovered strong line emissions correlated with the solar wind conditions around the earth ( @xcite ) .",
    "careful analysis might be able to remove this variable emission from the other x - ray diffuse emission ( eg .",
    "the general contribution of the heliospheric swcx has been also debated and demonstrated in several cases ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in particular , @xcite showed that several observed variations on short or medium time scale can be interpreted to be of the heliospheric swcx origin .",
    "if the heliospheric swcx actually contributes to a certain amount of the soft x - ray background , long term emission variations related to the 11-year solar cycle and the inhomogeneity of the interstellar neutral distributions around the sun are expected .",
    "large variations are mainly expected because of the anisotropic slow / fast solar wind distributions in the solar corona ( @xcite ) . due to the difference in plasma temperature ,",
    "the o@xmath5 and o@xmath6 ionization fractions of the slow solar wind ( higher temperature ) are much larger than those of the fast solar wind .",
    "conversely , the ionization fractions of oxygen ions with ionization state lower than o@xmath5 are higher in the fast solar wind . during the solar minimum phase ,",
    "the slow wind is restricted to within a low heliocentric ecliptic latitude area @xmath7 , and the fast wind widely extends from the polar regions ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the slow wind covers almost the whole solar corona during the maximum phase . for this reason",
    ", the heliospheric swcx - induced emission at high ecliptic latitudes is expected to depend on the long term ( 11-year ) solar activity .",
    "@xcite calculated all sky emission maps of the heliospheric swcx induced o and o lines on the basis of averaged , minimum and maximum solar activity in solar cycle 22 .",
    "they obtained different o and o maps with different solar activity levels , especially toward the high ecliptic latitudes .",
    "according to these model simulations , o at higher ecliptic latitudes may be enhanced by 12 line unit ( lu @xmath1 ) at solar maximum relative to minimum from the same observing site along the earth orbit .",

    "we thus need to use those observations made at the same period of time in each year .",
    "in addition , it is required to remove time intervals during which the o intensity is enhanced over @xmath4tens of ks , since this indicates enhancement by geocoronal swcx .",
    "we analyzed o and o line intensities toward the lockman hole ( in the high ecliptic latitude area at @xmath15 ) with suzaku ( @xcite ) , observed annually from 2006 to 2011 .",

    "the stated error ranges show 90% confidence level from the center value , and the vertical error bars in the figures indicate @xmath16 level unless otherwise noted .",

    "the observation lh06 was also analyzed in @xcite , and our result is consistent with theirs ( see the details below ) .",
    "we start from the xis1 cleaned event files that are processed with standard data screening criteria . to avoid high energy particle penetration due to the earth s magnetic field , we extracted the data when cut off rigidity ( cor2 ) was larger than 8 gv @xmath25 .",
    "two bright sources whose flux was larger than @xmath26 erg @xmath27 s@xmath28 in the 0.5  2.0 kev band were removed by circles with diameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 centered at @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    after the data were screened with the above criteria , we additionally removed the intervals when geocoronal swcx - induced lines and the neutral o k@xmath33 line in the earth s atmosphere were enhanced ( screening procedures were described in @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",

    "therefore , we can assume that when variations reach a minimum intensity during each observation the spectrum is the least contaminated by geocoronal swcx .",
    "the intensity of the geocoronal swcx - induced line depends on the product of the neutral density in the atmosphere and the solar wind ion flux .",
    "a typical scale hight of the geocoronal neutrals is @xmath36 from the earth s surface ( @xcite ) , and the penetration depth of solar wind ions to the atmosphere is determined by the interplanetary plasma conditions ( @xcite ) . here",

    "the data of ace / swics  swims were only used when the quality flags of solar wind parameters were equal to 0 ( meaning `` good quality '' ) . in these observation intervals , there were some missing ace level 2 data , for which we compensated with the solar wind proton data measured by wind .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc_proton_ion ] shows the x  ray light curves in the 0.5  0.7 kev band , where o and o emission lines are dominant , of suzaku xis1 , the solar wind proton density and velocity with ace / swepam ( black ) and wind / swe ( red ) , and solar wind o@xmath5 ion flux with ace swics  swims during each observation .",
    "both ace and wind are orbiting around l1 ( @xmath37 @xmath3 sunward of earth ) , and there is a delay in the solar wind propagation from l1 to the earth .",
    "we shifted the solar wind data by using the velocity averaged over each observation .",
    "we compared energy spectra extracted from different intervals sorted by the proton flux in each observation , in order to judge the necessity of screening .",
    "note that the statistical errors in the x - ray light curves are too large to visually identify the influence of geocoronal swcx .    during lh07 , lh09 , and lh11 ,",
    "the proton fluxes , expressed as a product of the density and the velocity , were always less than @xmath38 @xmath27s@xmath28 . according to the solar wind monitoring at l1 ,",
    "both lh07 and lh09 occurred during slow solar wind conditions , and lh11 was in temporary fast conditions ( typical properties of the slow / fast solar winds are summarized in @xcite , table 1 ) .",
    "these were not screened by solar wind flux .    in lh06 and lh10 ,",
    "both proton and ion fluxes were enhanced by the passage of a corotating interaction region ( cir ) around the earth , in which slow solar wind is compressed by fast wind .",
    "we compared the o line intensities between the cir passage and the rest of the observation interval .",
    "the o intensities estimated from spectral fitting ( details are described in the next section ) were @xmath39 ( cir passage ) / @xmath40 ( the rest ) lu in lh06 , and @xmath41 ( cir passage ) / @xmath42 ( the rest ) lu in lh10 , respectively .",
    "we used only the data when the solar wind was consistently slow or fast ( i.e.  from 90 ks after the start of lh06 , and within 110 ks from the start of lh10 ) .",
    "although the proton density data presented a steep increase between 60 ks and 100 ks from the beginning of lh08 , there was no enhancement in both the o@xmath5 flux and o. estimated o intensities are @xmath43 ( 60 ks to 100 ks ) / @xmath44 ( the rest ) lu respectively .",
    "therefore , we did not screen the lh08 data by the solar wind flux .",
    "second , we calculated the structure of the geomagnetic field towards the suzaku line of sight ( los ) using the geopack 2008 ( @xcite ) . in all observations , the distance of the earth  center to the magnetopause ( etm ) varied from 1.5 to 15.0 @xmath3",
    "however , the effect of low etm distance on the energy spectrum was only confirmed during the passage of a cir in lh06 that had been already removed . in this analysis , we did not screen the data based on the etm distance .",
    "we checked the mixing of neutral oxygen lines to the o line .",
    "solar x - ray photons scattered with neutral oxygen in earth s atmosphere create the o k@xmath33 line emission ( centroids are @xmath45 ev and @xmath46 ev ) . in accordance with previous studies ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , we calculated the distributions of the neutrals in earth s atmosphere using the normal msise00 model 2001 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the count rate in the 0.50.6 kev band increased with the neutral column density only in lh07 .",
    "we decided to use the x - ray events of lh07 when the neutral oxygen column density was less than @xmath47 @xmath27 for observation intervals on earth s dayside , or @xmath48 @xmath27 on the nightside .",
    "the spectral differences in the 0.50.6 kev band were also seen in lh11 when the satellite orbited between the earth s day and night side .",
    "it is thought to be an effect of the neutral scattering occurring in the atmosphere very close to suzaku .",
    "we only used the lh11 data for spectral analysis when suzaku was on the nightside .",
    "in addition , a goes c4.2 class x - ray flare was observed on may 5th 11:00 ut during lh07 , and an m2.0 class flare was observed on june 12th 9:00 ut during lh10 .",
    "however , there was no significant o k@xmath33 enhancement in either the suzaku light curve or the energy spectrum , so we included the data acquired during the flare arrivals .",
    "we created a redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) for conversion between the pulse invariant ( pi ) channel spectrum and the energy spectrum , and an auxiliary response file ( arf ) for the spectral fitting , using the suzaku ftools software * xisrmfgen * ver .",

    "in order to confirm the reproducibility of * xisnxbgen * , we compared count rates of the calculated nxb with those in each lockman hole observation above 12  kev , where the xrt does not reflect x - ray photons .",
    "the count rates were consistent within 10% .",
    "these results were consistent with other papers ( @xcite and @xcite ) . to correct the slight difference of the calculated nxb and the observed background , we scaled the normalization of nxb spectrum to equalize its count rate above 12 kev to that of each lh observation .",
    "the purpose of this spectral analysis is to obtain the o k@xmath33 ( 0.57 kev ) and o ly@xmath33 ( 0.65 kev ) line intensities precisely , and scrutinize the variability of them among different observations .",
    "however , there are some contributions at these line energies from other diffuse emission components that can not be resolved with the ccd resolution .",
    "therefore , we need to estimate this contribution by using a certain range of energy spectra .",
    "the diffuse emission model consists of three components ; the extragalactic unresolved point sources ( cosmic x - ray background ; cxb ) , the galactic halo gas , and a blend of the `` local hot bubble '' ( lhb ) and swcx .",
    "the emission of cxb , which is the dominant component in 25  kev , is represented by double broken power laws .",
    "their photon indices are @xmath50 and @xmath51 below the folding energy at 1.2 kev and @xmath52 above it . following @xcite , we normalized the broken power law component with photon index of @xmath53 to 5.7 photons s@xmath28 kev@xmath28 sr@xmath28 at 1 kev .",
    "galactic halo gas , the hot interstellar medium in the galaxy , is represented by a thin thermal plasma with @xmath54 kev , absorbed by the galactic neutrals ( @xcite ) .",
    "the blend of lhb ( @xmath55 k gas surrounding our solar system ) and swcx is represented by an unabsorbed thin thermal plasma with @xmath56 kev .",
    "though the emission process and fine structures of swcx induced lines are quite different from a collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) plasma ( @xcite ) , we treated them as a single cie plasma in this analysis in accordance with many previous works ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "for the thin thermal plasma emission , the _ apec _ model ( with atomdb ver.2.0.1 ) is applied to estimate both the galactic halo gas and the lhb@xmath57swcx emissions .      to estimate the oxygen line intensities",
    ", we first tried to fit the spectra using a broad energy range from 0.4 to 5.5 kev .",
    "figure [ fig : spec_tae ] shows the lockman hole spectra with their best fit double broken power laws @xmath57 galactic halo @xmath57 ( lhb @xmath57 swcx ) models .",
    "all six spectra are fitted simultaneously .",
    "first , we tried to fit the spectra with the same normalization of cxb for all observations , because their pointing directions were almost the same .",
    "the result showed the 90 % confidence ranges of the temperature and the normalized halo all overlapped .",
    "therefore , we decided to take the same value of the halo parameters for all observations .",
    "the temperature of the lhb@xmath57swcx blend was fixed at the typical temperature @xmath58 kev ( @xmath59 k ) , derived from observations of the local blank field region , where the contribution of the halo was almost negligible due to the large interstellar absorption ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the best fit values are summarized in the upper 6 rows in table [ tab : spec_tae_dpow ] .",
    "the reduced @xmath60 value is 0.999 for 636 d.o.f . , and all spectra were well reproduced by this model .      after determining the model parameters of wide band spectra in @xmath61[sec : analysis_fit_wide ]",
    ", we tried to fit the same spectra again by fixing the halo temperature at the best fit values , and setting zero oxygen abundances for both the halo and lhb@xmath57swcx , but inserting three gaussian lines at the o k@xmath33 , o ly@xmath33 , and o k@xmath62 energies .",
    "as reported in @xcite , the o ly@xmath33 line intensity is weak and the o k@xmath62 line at 666 ev can not be resolved from o ly@xmath33 .",
    "for this reason , it is hard to determine the error of the o ly@xmath33 line energy centroid in the lockman hole observations .",
    "we fixed the centroid of o k@xmath33 at 567 ev , averaging the centroids of resonance ( 574 ev ) and forbidden ( 561 ev ) lines , and the centroids of o ly@xmath33 and o k@xmath62 at 653 ev and 666 ev respectively .",
    "the fraction of the o k@xmath62 to o k@xmath33 was also fixed at @xmath63 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the lower 6 rows in table [ tab : spec_tae_dpow ] show the best fit results with this new model , and here we define the intensity of o and o lines by normalization of the two inserted gaussian lines . according to this fitting result , the o intensities of the earlier four observations were almost constant within the 90 % statistical error range .",
    "however , those of lh10 and lh11 are @xmath0 lu ( @xmath64 ) brighter than the others .",
    "the statistical significances of the o intensity variation of lh10 and lh11 with respect to an average of lh06 to lh09 ( @xmath65 lu ) are @xmath66 ( lh10 ) and @xmath67 ( lh11 ) , respectively .",
    "when we use an apec model with zero o abundance , it is implicitly assumed that the continuum by o atoms is negligible . to confirm that the contribution of the continuum is small",
    ", we also fitted the spectra with a thermal plasma model including the continuum by o atoms but no o k@xmath33 , o ly@xmath33 and o k@xmath62 lines , along with three gaussian lines representing the o emission lines .",
    "the normalization of the three gaussian lines did not change by more than a few % .",
    "hence , we conclude that the contribution of the continuum is small .",
    "note that continuum emission is expected if the origin is a thermal plasma , while no continuum is expected if the origin is swcx .",
    "our results suggest that the intensity of the three lines can be precisely determined regardless of the continuum assumption , i.e. , the origin of the emission .",
    "the absolute intensities of o / o lines strongly depend on the x - ray detection efficiency and emission model ( @xcite ) .",
    "first , we checked the uncertainty due to the contaminant thickness on the xis optical blocking filter .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of contaminant thickness is estimated to be @xmath68 of the nominal value in the caldb files ( suzaku technical description ) .",
    "we changed the efficiency described in the arf using the software * xiscontamicalc * version 20101105 according to the thickness uncertainty .",
    "these systematic errors are smaller than the 90 % statistical ones in table [ tab : spec_tae_dpow ] , and we only show the results with the arf of nominal contamination thickness . if the o lines of lh10 and lh11 are equal to the early four observations , the thickness must be overestimated by @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the nominal values in may 2010 and june 2011 , respectively ( according to the latest caldb ae_xi[1 - 3]_contami_20091201.fits ) .",
    "second , we checked the contribution of the uncertainty of the cxb spectrum below 2 kev to the determination of oxygen line intensities .",
    "we tried to use a single power law model with photon index @xmath71 for the cxb emission instead of double broken power laws .",
    "the oxygen lines systematically became @xmath72 lu larger than in the case of using the double broken power laws cxb model .",

    "from the results of spectral fitting , we found that o intensities toward the lockman hole were enhanced by @xmath0 lu in 2010 and 2011 , compared to those from 2006 to 2009 , during which the intensity was constant within 90% statistical errors .",
    "a statistically significant variation of the o line was not detected in our analysis .    as we described in ",
    "[ sec : analysis_model ] , o emission is considered to arise from three different origins : hot galactic halo , lhb , and geocoronal / heliospheric swcx .",
    "the emission from the halo and lhb is not time variable on the present observation time scales , and the small difference of the field of view due to azimuthal rotations ( 20 % ) is not likely to produce the observed variation .",
    "the data were screened for enhancements on times of a few tens of ks as much as possible .",
    "after this correction , we may consider that most of the geocoronal swcx is removed .",
    "however , enhancements of the heliospheric component due to solar wind ion flux increases in the near - earth environment ( @xmath108 au scale ) are not removed .",
    "thus we next checked the correlation between the o intensity and the solar wind flux averaged over the observation period .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : ovii_vs_pflx ] . during the four suzaku observations excluding the first and last ones ( lh06 and 11 ) , slow solar wind passed around the earth .",
    "the ionization states of ions can be considered to be similar for the four observations ( lh07 to lh10 ) .",
    "therefore we can consider that the o@xmath5 flux is proportional to the proton flux at least for the four observations .",
    "since the typical elapsed time of the observations is two days , and the typical wind speed is @xmath109 km / s , the lack of positive correlation in figure  [ fig : ovii_vs_pflx ] suggests that the o variation is not correlated with the average ion flux on @xmath110 au scales .",
    "as we discussed in @xmath111 , the parallax can produce intensity variations .",
    "however , all the observations were made between may 3 and june 13 , and we find no correlation between the o intensity and the day of year of the observation .",
    "thus the variation is not due to parallax .",
    "we thus consider that the variation is related to variations of the ion flux or the density of neutrals averaged along the line of sight for lengths longer than @xmath4 0.5 au .",
    "a possible explanation for this is the long term variation of the solar wind properties associated with the solar activity .",
    "based on the number of sunspots , the solar minimum of the cycle 23 was around december 2008 , and then solar cycle 24 began . as we described in @xmath111 , one of the observational differences between the solar maximum and the minimum",
    "is the distributions of the slow and fast solar wind in the solar corona ( @xcite ) .",
    "the direction of the lh is in the relatively high ecliptic latitude area , at @xmath112 , hence the variability of the boundary between the slow and fast winds would affect the o intensity .",

    "solar activities in the northern and southern hemispheres show different time dependences .",
    "the sunspot numbers in the southern hemisphere change symmetrically about the solar minimum , and those in 2006 are almost the same as in 2010 to 2011 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sunspot numbers in northern hemisphere are less than 10 from 2006 to 2010 , while they rapidly increase after the minimum and reach 40 in june 2011 .",
    "the suzaku line of sight ( los ) points toward the northern hemisphere of the sun , and here we focus on the solar activity in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the figure suggests that the enhancement of o emission in 2010 is related to the rapid increase of sunspot number in the northern hemisphere .",
    "this unusual situation may be correlated with the north - south assymetry in sun s polar magnetic field reported by hinode ( @xcite ) .",
    "the solar wind distribution maps are obtained by the interplanetary scintillation method ( ste lab . ) .",
    "though the fast wind whose velocity is @xmath113 km s@xmath28 extends at high latitudes from 2006 to 2009 , the slow solar wind ( @xmath114 km s@xmath28 ) actually spreads throughout the northern hemisphere in 2011 . if the slow / fast solar wind boundary is at @xmath115 at solar minimum , the line of sight ( los ) of the present observations crosses the boundary and enters into the fast - wind region at @xmath108 au from the earth . beyond that point , the los stays in the fast wind region . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume the boundary is at @xmath116 at the solar maximum , the los is in the slow wind all the way to the outer boundary of the heliosphere .",
    "next , we estimated the swcx o intensity following the model developed by @xcite . in their model , both solar wind ions and interstellar neutrals",
    "distribute self - consistently by considering charge exchange loss processes ; the density of the solar wind ions basically has an @xmath117 dependence from the sun , and the densities of interstellar hydrogen and helium were simulated from the so - called classical `` hot model '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "we integrated the heliospheric swcx emission along the los within 90 au from the earth .",
    "all of the parameters used in this model are same as the @xcite : solar wind proton density is 6.5/3.2 @xmath118 , velocity 400/750 km s@xmath28 , o / h abundance ratio 1/1780 / 1/1550 , and o@xmath5 ionization fraction 0.20/0.03 for the slow / fast wind at 1 au respectively . in this case , the model predicts o line @xmath119 lu assuming the solar maximum / minimum conditions for the neutral distribution ( note that the increase of o intensity is smaller than that expected when we just change the beta angle of fast / slow wind boundary , because the density of neutrals decreases due to strong photoionization by the solar uv photons and charge exchange by the solar wind protons . )",
    "thus this model can explain about one third of the observed o intensity variations .",
    "there are uncertainties in the solar wind parameters , in particular , of high ecliptic latitude directions .",
    "the factor of about three discrepancy may be explained by those uncertainties .",
    "because the solar wind contains ions other than o@xmath5 , the swcx induced x - ray emission should also contain emission other than o. however , those lines were too weak .",
    "o emission was positively detected , although its temporal variation was not significantly detected . from the @xcite maps we estimate that the oviii line intensity during solar maximum is @xmath120 lu and during solar minimum @xmath121 lu .",
    "the upper limit of the measured oviii intensity variation ( @xmath122 lu ) is consistent with the model predictions .",

    "dimitra koutroumpa for showing us the details of her model and a number of fruitful suggestions as the referee .",
    "we also thank to the suzaku , ace , and wind team for providing the data .",
