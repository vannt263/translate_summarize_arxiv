    "however , in several realistic scenarios the system may be simultaneously influenced by many environments @xcite .",

    "a similar situation also occurs for a single - donor electron spin in silicon @xcite .",
    "motivated by these practical situations @xcite , some efforts have been devoted to study the effects of multiple environments on the dynamics of an open system @xcite .",
    "quantum interference effects have been found to occur between independent reservoirs when all of them interact with a quantum system and are in non - markovian regimes , which qualitatively modify the dynamics of the interested system @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a spin simultaneously coupled to two decoherence channels , one markovian and the other non - markovian , has been analyzed with respect to the different decoherence mechanisms @xcite .",
    "as is known , a qubit ( i.e. , a two - level system ) interacting with a single vacuum bosonic reservoir may exhibit markovian or non - markovian dynamics depending on the strength of the system - reservoir coupling @xcite . by contrast , if the qubit simultaneously interacts with several reservoirs , its dynamics can be always non - markovian provided that the number of the contributing reservoirs is greater than a critical value @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a qubit coupled to a hierarchical environment made of a single - mode cavity and a structured reservoir with lorentzian spectral density has been studied , showing that a shorter ( longer ) memory time of the reservoir does not generally mean a smaller ( larger ) non - markovianity of the system @xcite .",
    "a new analytical method based on a phase space representation of the system density matrix has been also proposed to study the dynamics of a discrete system in a two - tiered non - markovian environment @xcite .    in the treatments of composite environments",
    "@xcite , the role of the coupling between environmental parts is not typically taken into account . despite this , the knowledge of how this environmental parameter influences the non - markovian character of an open quantum system would provide insightful developments for engineering and controlling quantum memories for possible technological applications .",

    "<S> controlling the non - markovian dynamics of open quantum systems is essential in quantum information technology since it plays a crucial role in preserving quantum memory . </S>",
    "<S> albeit in many realistic scenarios the quantum system can simultaneously interact with composite environments , this condition remains little understood , particularly regarding the effect of the coupling between environmental parts . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the non - markovian behavior of a qubit interacting at the same time with two coupled single - mode cavities which in turn dissipate into memoryless or memory - keeping reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> we show that increasing the control parameter , that is the two - mode coupling , allows for triggering and enhancing a non - markovian dynamics for the qubit starting from a markovian one in absence of coupling . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , if the qubit dynamics is non - markovian for zero control parameter , increasing the latter enables multiple transitions from non - markovian to markovian regimes . </S>",
    "<S> these results hold independently on the nature of the reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> this work highlights that suitably engineering the coupling between parts of a compound environment can efficiently harness the quantum memory , stored in a qubit , based on non - markovianity . </S>"
