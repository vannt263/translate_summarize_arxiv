    "the entanglement in extended quantum systems and the ways to quantify it has attracted a lot of research during the last decade in different areas of theoretical physics like condensed matter , quantum information and quantum gravity ( see @xcite for reviews ) .    given a quantum system in a pure state @xmath0 and assuming that its hilbert space is bipartite , i.e. @xmath1 , the entanglement entropy is an important quantity to measure the entanglement between the two parts of the system . in this manuscript we consider only spatial bipartitions , denoting by @xmath2 a generic spatial region and by @xmath3 its complement .",
    "the @xmath2 s reduced density matrix @xmath4 is obtained by tracing over @xmath5 the density matrix @xmath6 of the entire system .",
    "the normalisation condition is @xmath7 and the von neumann entropy of @xmath4 defines the entanglement entropy , namely [ sa def ] s_a = - ( _ a _ a ) .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath8 obtained from @xmath3 s reduced density matrix can be introduced in the same way .",
    "when @xmath9 is a pure state , we have that @xmath10 .    important quantities to study the bipartite entanglement of pure states are also the rnyi entropies , which are defined as follows [ renyi entropies def ] s_a^(n ) = _ a^n , where @xmath11 is an integer parameter .",
    "the entanglement entropy ( [ sa def ] ) can be found from the rnyi entropies ( [ renyi entropies def ] ) as @xmath12 .",
    "this limit requires to perform an analytical continuation of @xmath13 to real values of @xmath14 close to @xmath15 . for a pure state @xmath16 for any value of @xmath14 .",
    "when the subsystem @xmath17 is made by two regions , which can be either disjoint or adjacent , an interesting quantity to consider is the mutual information , i.e. [ mi def ] i_a_1 , a_2 = s_a_1 + s_a_2 - s_a_1 a_2 = _",

    "the mutual information measures the total amount of correlations between the two systems @xcite .",
    "for some quantum systems on the lattice , the entanglement entropy @xmath19 grows like the area of the boundary of the subsystem @xmath2 as its size increases @xcite .",
    "this area law behaviour of @xmath19 has been proved for gapped systems on the lattice @xcite , but for critical systems the situation is more complicated : important exceptions are the critical systems in one spatial dimension , where @xmath19 diverges logarithmically with the length of the interval @xmath2 @xcite , and free fermions in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "when the continuum limit is described by a quantum field theory , an ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff @xmath20 must be introduced and @xmath19 is a divergent quantity for @xmath21 .",
    "the area law behaviour can occur in the coefficient of the most divergent term , which is non universal and turns out to be proportional to the area of @xmath22 ( i.e. the boundary of @xmath2 ) in these cases .",

    "@xmath2 whose boundary is smooth , the expansion of the rnyi entropies reads @xmath30 as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the perimeter of @xmath2 and the coefficient @xmath33 depends on the model and on the details of the uv regularisation .",
    "the replica limit implies that @xmath34 as @xmath31 , where @xmath35 .",
    "when the two dimensional spatial domain @xmath2 has a non smooth boundary , @xmath36 contains also a subleading logarithmic term whose coefficient is independent of the regularisation details .",
    "such coefficient is obtained as the sum of the contributions of the vertices of the curve @xmath22 , where each term is given by a model dependent function ( corner function ) evaluated on the opening angle in @xmath2 of the corresponding vertex .",
    "many interesting studies have been done on such corner functions in various lattice models @xcite . for a cft in @xmath29 dimensions , it has been recently found that the leading term in the expansion of the corner function as the opening angle @xmath37 is close to @xmath38 provides the constant characterising the two - point function of the stress tensor @xcite . within the context of the ads / cft correspondence ,",
    "the prescription to compute holographically the entanglement entropy in the regime where classical gravity can be employed has been found in @xcite . in the case of ads@xmath39/cft@xmath40 ,",
    "such holographic prescription provides also the expected subleading logarithmic divergence whenever @xmath22 contains vertices @xcite .",
    "the mutual information ( [ mi def ] ) of disjoint domains with smooth boundaries is a uv finite quantity because the area law terms cancel .",

    "another important example of mixed state is the reduced density matrix @xmath4 associated to a subsystem @xmath2 , when the entire system is in its ground state . splitting @xmath2 in two domains @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which can be either adjacent or disjoint , it is worth considering the bipartite entanglement between them .",
    "many measures of the bipartite entanglement for a mixed state have been proposed in quantum information theory , but they are usually very difficult to compute , even for small systems . a measure which is computable also for extended systems is the logarithmic negativity @xcite .    let us consider a mixed state characterised by the density matrix @xmath9 acting on a spatially bipartite hilbert space @xmath46 .",
    "we remark that @xmath47 can be either the hilbert space characterising the whole spatial system or the one @xmath48 associated to the bipartite subsystem @xmath49 introduced above ( in the latter case @xmath50 ) .",
    "the logarithmic negativity is defined through the partial transpose of @xmath9 with respect to one of the two parts .",
    "considering e.g. the partial transposition with respect to @xmath42 , the matrix element of @xmath51 is given by [ partialtransp ] e_i^(1 ) e_j^(2)| ^t_2| e_k^(1 ) e_l^(2)= e_i^(1 ) e_l^(2)| | e_k^(1 ) e_j^(2 ) .",

    "thus , for the configurations in the top panels of fig.[fig : configsqft ] and assuming that only one scale @xmath24 occurs to determine the logarithmic term , one can construct the following uv finite quantity [ neg minus mi ] - i^(1/2)_a_1 , a_2 .",
    "for the same configurations , also the following combinations , depending on the parity of the integer @xmath14 , are uv finite [ renyi neg minus mi ] _ n_o - i^(n_o)_a_1 , a_2 , _ n_e - ( 1- ) i^(n_e/2)_a_1 , a_2 .",
    "the second expression in ( [ renyi neg minus mi ] ) provides ( [ neg minus mi ] ) after the analytic continuation @xmath276 . in a @xmath29 dimensional",
    "cft , the quantities in ( [ neg minus mi ] ) and ( [ renyi neg minus mi ] ) should give non trivial scale invariant functions of the parameters characterising the adjacent domains .",
    "for example , when the adjacent domains are given by a disk of radius @xmath277 and an annulus surrounding it whose radii are @xmath278 , the expression ( [ neg minus mi ] ) should be a model dependent function of the ratio @xmath279",
    ". it would be interesting to compute such function analytically .",
    "the configurations of adjacent domains shown in the bottom panels of fig.[fig : configsqft ] are more interesting because the corner functions corresponding to the vertices highlighted by the red circles is not related to the corner functions occurring in the entanglement entropies .",
    "thus , because of such terms , we expect that the combinations in ( [ neg minus mi ] ) and ( [ renyi neg minus mi ] ) diverge logarithmically for these configurations .",
    "in this manuscript we have investigated the logarithmic negativity @xmath63 and the moments of the partial transpose for adjacent domains @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the ground state of a two dimensional harmonic square lattice with nearest neighbour spring - like interaction .",
    "the regime of massless oscillators in the thermodynamic limit has been considered .    by exploring various configurations of adjacent domains",
    ", we have shown that , at leading order for large domains , the logarithmic negativity and the quantity @xmath64 introduced in ( [ en def ] ) satisfy an area law in terms of the length of the shared curve @xmath141 , suggesting a relation between the coefficient of the area law term in these quantities and the coefficient of the area law term in the rnyi entropies .",
    "a subleading universal logarithmic term occurs in @xmath63 and @xmath64 whenever the shared curve contains vertices , being its endpoints included among them .",
    "the values of the corner function of @xmath63 have been obtained for some pairs of angles . for the vertices of @xmath141 corresponding to pairs of explementary angles",
    ", we have proposed that the corner function of @xmath64 is related to the corner function entering in the rnyi entropies @xcite .",
    "this relation implies that the corner function of @xmath63 for this kind of vertices coincides with the corner function of the rnyi entropy of order @xmath187 .",
    "this statement has been supported by numerical evidences shown in fig.[fig : cornernegold ] .",
    "as for the vertices of the curve @xmath141 corresponding to a tripartition of the angle of @xmath205 , their contribution to the logarithmic term in @xmath63 and @xmath64 is characterised by a new corner function which depends on two independent angular variables .",
    "the numerical values of this corner function for @xmath63 have been given in ( [ corner tri - vertex values ] ) for some pair of angles ( see also fig.[fig : cornernegnew ] ) .",
    "let us conclude with some open questions",
    ". it would be interesting to provide further checks of ( [ conj corner neg 1/2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the analytic continuation to @xmath188 of the corner function found by casini and huerta @xcite should be performed .",
    "more importantly , a method should be found to compute analytically the corner functions @xmath272 and @xmath280 for the vertices partitioning the angle of @xmath205 in three parts . by analogy with the results of @xcite obtained for the corner function of @xmath19 ,",
    "it could be interesting to study the corner function @xmath281 for equal angles as @xmath282 . in order to extract reliable numerical results for the logarithmic term of @xmath64 from the fit of the lattice data , the unusual corrections to the scaling",
    "must be studied , extending the analysis done by cardy and calabrese @xcite in @xmath23 dimensions .",
    "finally , it is worth studying the corner contributions to @xmath63 and @xmath64 for other models , both on the lattice and in the continuum .",
