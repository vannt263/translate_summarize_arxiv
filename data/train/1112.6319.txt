    "<S> using density functional theory , we study physical properties of boron nitride nanotubes ( bnnts ) with the substitutional carbon pair defect . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the stone - wales ( sw ) rearrangement of the c - c pair defect in the bnnt . </S>",
    "<S> the formation energy of an sw defect of the carbon dimer is approximately 3.1 ev lower than that of the sw - transformed b - n pair in the undoped bnnt . </S>",
    "<S> the activation energies show that the sw defect in the c - doped bnnt may be experimentally observed with a higher probability than in the undoped bnnt . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the localized states originating from the carbon pair impurities .    as a wide - band - gap nanomaterial@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) is a stable crystalline form consisting of equal numbers of boron and nitrogen atoms in a honeycomb arrangement@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as it has considerably high thermal and chemical stabilities@xcite , it can be used for high - temperature applications . the bn nanotube ( bnnt)@xcite is a nano - sized seamless cylinder that can be considered a rolled - up h - bn sheet . </S>",
    "<S> it also has a wide band gap that is almost independent of the tube diameter , and chirality@xcite . for @xmath0-bonded carbon nanostructures such as fullerenes , carbon nanotubes and graphene , the stone - wales ( sw ) transformation@xcite </S>",
    "<S> is believed to introduce topological defects or isomerization , which results in a 90@xmath1 rotation of two carbon atoms with respect to the midpoint of the c - c bond .    </S>",
    "<S> when an sw defect is present in h - bn or bnnt , b - b and n - n bonds should be created , and the formation of these bonds increases the total energy of the system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the topological defect created by the sw rearrangement is lacking . </S>",
    "<S> however , the formation of b - b and n - n bond pairs can be avoided if there is a c - c pair defect in h - bn ( or bnnt ) . using post - synthesis doping , </S>",
    "<S> carbon impurities can be substituted in the h - bn layers@xcite . during the formation of bnnts and h - bn sheets using the chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) </S>",
    "<S> , carbon atoms may act as substitutional defects , because residual hydrocarbon may remain in the chamber , or carbon impurities are solubilized in the metal catalyst . </S>",
    "<S> if carbon substitutional atoms congregate together in a local area in h - bn ( or a bundle of bnnts ) by segregation , they may form the interlayer ( or intertube ) conduction channels . as mentioned above </S>",
    "<S> , the c - c pair defect in the h - bn network prohibits the formation of b - b and n - n bonds during the sw transformation . as the sw - transformed defects may affect the mechanical and electrical properties of the bn nanostrucutres </S>",
    "<S> , we should thus study these defects in the c - doped bn sheets or bnnts . </S>",
    "<S> this work may explain the formation of topological defects in the carbon - doped bnnts or h - bn layers that can be produced in the cvd processes . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper , we present our first - principles study of the structural and electronic properties of the bnnts containing two substitutional carbon defects . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of carbon doping on the sw transformation is also examined .        </S>",
    "<S> we carried out total energy calculations for our model systems based on the density functional theory@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite with spin polarization was used for the exchange - correlation functional . </S>",
    "<S> some calculations were repeated using the generalized gradient approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the exchange - correlation functional did not change our main conclusion that the sw defect in the c - doped bnnt may be observed with a higher probability than in the bare bnnt . to study the energetics and the activation energy barrier in the sw transformation of the systems </S>",
    "<S> , we used a plane wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 400 ev and ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp)@xcite . the atomistic models were relaxed until the residual forces on the atoms became smaller than 0.03 ev /  . </S>",
    "<S> for the activation energy barrier , we employed the nudged elastic band method@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eight replicas were selected , including the initial and final configurations to construct an elastic band . to plot the density of states ( dos ) and </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunctions with phase information , we used the openmx code@xcite . in the calculations using the openmx code , </S>",
    "<S> the ionic potentials were described with norm - conserving troullier - martins pseudopotentials . </S>",
    "<S> wavefunctions were expanded in a pseudoatomic orbital basis set@xcite with an energy cutoff of 120 ry . as a model system , we chose the ( 8,0 ) zigzag bnnt containing 48 b atoms and 48 n atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the supercell size in the lateral direction was 25    to avoid the interaction between the defects in neighboring bnnts , and the size in the axial direction was 12.96  .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( bottom panel ) the corresponding three states are shown for the sw transformation from bnc1 to bncr1 . , width=302 ]    .calculated activation ( @xmath3 ) and formation ( @xmath2 ) energies for the sw transformation from the c - doped or the bnnts to the bnnts with sw defects . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     first , we optimized the c - doped and undoped bnnts . </S>",
    "<S> the perfect bnnt has a b - n bond length of @xmath4 1.44  . </S>",
    "<S> our total energy calculations show that the two substitutional carbon atoms tend to bind to each other . </S>",
    "<S> this finding agrees with k. yuge s report that the lowest - formation - energy structures for monolayer boron - carbon - nitride favor b - n and c - c bonds whereas they disfavor b - c , c - n , b - b , and n - n bonds@xcite . for c - doping , two types of c - c pairs can be considered . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figure 1 , one pair ( bnc1 ) was parallel to the tube axis and the other ( bnc2 ) had an oblique angle with the tube axis . </S>",
    "<S> the bond length of the c - c pair was 1.37   ( 1.39  ) for bnc1 ( bnc2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the bond length of benzene ( c@xmath5h@xmath5 ) has a very similar c - c bond length of 1.40  . </S>",
    "<S> although the model of bnc1 had the lowest energy among our model systems for the c - c pair , the energy difference between bnc1 and bnc2 was only @xmath41 mev / atom . thus , two structures may coexist . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , by the chemical potential analysis , we found that the formation of carbon substitutional defects in the bnnts , bnc1 or bnc2 , is possible when the chemical potential of an isolated c - c pair is larger than by -18.02 ev or -17.90 ev . </S>",
    "<S> note that the energy of an c - c pair is -10.09 ev .    in the c - c pair , the c atom bonded to two b atoms protruded out by @xmath4 0.1  . </S>",
    "<S> the b - c bond length was 1.52   and the n - c bond length was 1.46  , which was due to the longer covalent radius of b ( r@xmath6 = 0.84  ) than that of n ( r@xmath7 = 0.71  ) . when the c - c bond was rotated by 90@xmath1 , the bond length slightly decreased to 1.35  . here </S>",
    "<S> , the b - c bond length was increased to 1.61  , and the n - c bond length was slightly decreased to 1.44  . </S>",
    "<S> after the sw transformation from the bnc1 to the bncr1 structure , the total energy of bncr1 increased by 2.5 ev , compared to that of bnc1 . for this structure , the activation energy from bnc1 to bncr1 was 5.5 ev . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the formation and activation energies were 2.2 ev and 5.6 ev , respectively , for the sw transformation from bnc2 to bncr2 ( see table i ) .    for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also calculated the formation and activation energies for the sw transformation in the undoped ( 8,0 ) bnnt as shown in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> for the sw transformation from bn1 to bnr1 ( _ _ o__r from bn2 to bnr2 ) , the formation energy was 5.6 ev ( 5.7 ev ) , and the activation energy was 7.0 ev ( 7.6 ev ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , a b - b bond and a n - n bond are produced , and their lengths are 1.73   ( b - b ) and 1.47   ( n - n ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the rotating c - c bond ( 1.24  ) was shorter than the rotating b - n bond ( 1.29  ) in the transition states . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the shorter bond results in a lower activation energy barrier during the sw transformation in a small area . </S>",
    "<S> the high formation energy is due to the unstable b - b and n - n bonds as mentioned earlier . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , electrons were accumulated in the n atom of the rotating b - n pair in the transition state for the undoped bnnt . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our charge analysis revealed that electron donation from the c - c pair defect in the c - doped bnnt slightly weakens the dangling - bond - like character of the b and n atoms in the transition configuration . in our previous study of the sw transformation in m@c@xmath8 ( m = k , ca , and la ) , we similarly observed that the electron donation by the incorporated metal atom lowers the activation energy barrier@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these findings can explain the lower activation energy barrier of the c - c pair defect compared to that of the b - n pair . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , when the c - doped bnnt _ does _ exist , e.g. , from the sample preparation , we can conclude that the probability that the sw defect is observed is higher in the c - doped bnnt than in the undoped bnnt .        to check a charge doping effect </S>",
    "<S> , we calculated doping of a hole ( charge + @xmath9 state ) for all the model structures ( bnr1 , bnr2 , bncr1 , and bncr2 ) , and an electron doping case ( charge -@xmath9 state ) for bnr2 structure . when a hole was doped , the activation energy barriers were _ reduced _ from 7.04 ev to 6.91 ev for bnr1 , 7.63 ev to 7.18 ev for bnr2 , 5.50 ev to 5.23 ev for bncr1 , and 5.64 ev to 5.52 ev for bncr2 , respectively . for an electron doping in bnr2 , and the activation energy was _ decreased _ from 7.63 ev to 6.69 ev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can conclude that charge doping affects the activation energy barriers of the sw transformation .    in a growth process of the bnnts , </S>",
    "<S> carbon atoms may be incorporated as residual impurities . or one can produce carbon substitutional defects in the bnnts on purpose for doping . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that two carbon atoms far from each other tend to become closer and form a c - c pair . </S>",
    "<S> the energy difference between the c - c pair and two separate carbon atoms was larger than 5 ev in our lda calculation . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , some metal atoms or molecules such as o@xmath10 and br@xmath10 may be adsorbed in the vicinity of the c - c pair . </S>",
    "<S> then , electron transfer takes place between the adsorbate and the nanotube . as mentioned above </S>",
    "<S> , charge doping enables the activation energy barrier to become lowered and the probability of the sw transformation to become higher .    </S>",
    "<S> -point . </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]    according to our lda calculation , the energy band gap of the perfect ( 8,0 ) bnnt is 3.6 ev as shown in figure 3a . </S>",
    "<S> r. wu et al . reported that the bnnt could have a magnetic moment due to the carbon doping@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they considered only one carbon atom in the supercell . </S>",
    "<S> however , our calculational results demonstrated that the magnetic moment does not occur in the bnnt with the c - c pair defect . according to a recent report by n. berseneva et al . </S>",
    "<S> , the magnetic moment is zero when the numbers of carbon atoms replaced by nitrogen and boron atoms are identical@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3]b shows the total dos of bnnts with the c - c pair substitutional defect ( e.g. , bnc1 ) , which clearly demonstrates that a few localized states occur in the band gap in the presence of the c - c pair defect . as shown in figure  [ fig3]c , the projected dos of the two c atoms in the c - c pair defect indicates that the gap states originate from the substitutional carbon pair defects . when a c - c pair forms a sw defect by a 90@xmath1 rotation as seen in bncr1 , the electronic states originating from the sw defect have flatter bands with more localized characters . </S>",
    "<S> these characteristics are reflected in the sharp and narrow peaks in the dos in the gap ( figure  [ fig3]d and [ fig3]e ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4 ] shows wavefunction characters resulting from the defect states in the bnnts with the substitutional carbon pair defect and its sw - transformed defect . </S>",
    "<S> the occupied state at @xmath111.4 ev and the unoccupied state at @xmath121.7 ev shown in figure [ fig4]a are the localized defect states originating primarily from the c - c pair of the bnc1 structure . </S>",
    "<S> the filled state has a bonding character , whereas the unfilled state has a antibonding character at the c - c pair . as displayed in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a , the electron density at the c atom bonded to b atoms is somewhat higher than that at the c atom bonded to n atoms at @xmath111.4 ev </S>",
    "<S> . additionally , the b - c bonds are in the bonding states but the c - n bonds are in the antibonding states . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , figure  [ fig4]b shows the localized defect states at @xmath111.3 ev and @xmath121.8 ev from the sw - transformed c - c pair defect of the bncr1 structure . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the bnc1 case , bonding and antibonding characters of the carbon pair appear at @xmath111.3 ev and @xmath121.8 ev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that there is no mirror ( reflection ) symmentry for the bnnt with respect to the plane containing the midpoint of the c - c bond . </S>",
    "<S> however , the mirror symmetry is manifest with respect to the planes containing the c - c bond itself ( as in bnc1 ) as well as the midpoint of the sw - transformed c - c bond ( as in bncr1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these features were retained for two localized states as shown in figure  [ fig4]a and also for a localized state at @xmath111.3 ev as shown in figure  [ fig4]b .    in summary , we have introduced substitutional carbon pair defects in bnnts to examine the modifications in the structural and electronic properties of the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the two carbon atoms prefer to bind to each other with a bond length of @xmath41.37  . for the sw transformation of the c - c pair defect </S>",
    "<S> , the formation energy of the sw defect is approximately 2.5 ev and the activation energy is approximately 5.5 ev . both the formation and activation energies of the c - c bond are much lower than those of the b - n bond in the undoped bnnt in the sw transformation , which are @xmath45.5 ev and @xmath47.0 ev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , it would be very difficult to find a topological defect such as the sw defect in the perfect bnnt . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , such a topological defect could be observed with a higher probability in the c - rich defective bnnts . </S>"
