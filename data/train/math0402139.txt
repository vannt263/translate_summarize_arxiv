    "the fundamental theorem of prehomogeneous vector spaces @xcite , regarding the fourier transform of a complex power of a relative invariant , then states that for rapidly decreasing functions @xmath36 , @xmath37 on @xmath4 , respectively @xmath38 , the integrals @xmath39 which converge for @xmath40 , can be extended analytically to meromorphic functions on the whole complex @xmath17-plane , and satisfy the functional equations @xmath41 where @xmath42 is given by a product of @xmath43-functions , and the @xmath44 are entire functions .",
    "originally , the theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces developed from an attempt to construct dirichlet series satisfying functional equations in a systematic way .",
    "since every smooth affine algebraic variety @xmath45 which carries the action of a reductive algebraic group @xmath35 , and posesses an open orbit , is isomorphic to a homogeneous vector bundle @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a reductive subgroup of @xmath35 , and @xmath48 is a locally homogeneous @xmath47-vector bundle , the investigation of such @xmath35-varieties can be reduced to the study of locally transitive linear actions of connected reductive groups .    in classical representation theory , for every admissible irreducible representation @xmath49 of @xmath35 on some hilbert space @xmath47 , the continuous linear operators @xmath50 , defined by @xmath51 , where @xmath10 is some test function on @xmath35 , and @xmath52 denotes haar measure on @xmath35 , are of trace class , and the global character of @xmath53 is defined in terms of this trace as a distribution on @xmath35 . in this paper , we will consider the left regular representation @xmath6 of the group @xmath7 on the banach space @xmath8 of continuous functions on @xmath4 vanishing at infinity , and our main goal will consist in giving a description of the corresponding operators @xmath54 , where @xmath10 is a rapidly decreasing function on @xmath35 . since we will work in a @xmath55 framework , avoiding hilbert space theory entirely , we will rely on the theory of pseudodifferential operators in order to formulate our results .",

    ", a trace can be defined in a natural way by restricting its kernel to the diagonal , which yields a density on the underlying manifold . if the manifold is compact , it can be integrated , and the so defined trace coincides with the usual @xmath67-trace . in our situation ,",
