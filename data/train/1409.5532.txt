    "recently , there have been considerable researches on characterizing the _ degrees of freedom _ ( dof ) of wireless networks .",
    "as current wireless networks become very complicated , exact capacity characterization is so difficult that many researchers have actively studied approximate capacity characterizations in the shape of dof .",
    "the dof is the prelog factor of capacity , providing an intuitive metric for the number of interference - free communication channels that wireless networks can attain at the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime .",
    "hence , it is regarded as a primary performance metric for multiantenna and/or multiuser communication systems .",
    "cadambe and jafar recently made a remarkable progress on understanding dof of multiuser wireless networks showing that the sum dof of the @xmath0-user interference channel ( ic ) is given by @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "an innovative methodology called _ interference alignment _ ( ia ) has been proposed to obtain @xmath1 dof , which aligns multiple interfering signals into the same signal space at each receiver .",
    "the concept of such signal space alignment has been successfully adapted to various network environments , e.g. , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "more recently , different strategies of ia were further developed in terms of ergodic ia @xcite and real ia @xcite .",
    "note that most of the previous researches including the aforementioned ia techniques have focused on dof of wireless networks under the assumption that each transmitter perfectly knows global channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "however , for many practical communication systems , acquiring the exact csi value at transmitters is very challenging due to channel feedback delay , system overhead , and so on",
    ". motivated by these practical restrictions , implementing ia under a more relaxed csi condition has been actively studied in the literature .",
    "maddah - ali and tse made a breakthrough in @xcite demonstrating that completely outdated csi is still useful to improve dof of the @xmath0-user multiple - input and single - output ( miso ) broadcast channel ( bc ) .",
    "preceded by @xcite , there have been a series of researches for studying ia techniques exploiting outdated or delayed csi at transmitters @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "similar dof gains were shown in mimo bc under delayed csit and , in particular , the dof region of the two - user mimo bc with delayed csit was completely characterized in @xcite . in the context of ic , it has been first shown in @xcite that ia can achieve more than one dof in the three - user siso ic under delayed csit , which is then extended to the @xmath0-user case in @xcite .",
    "although there is still a practical demand for further relaxing csi requirements at the transmitter side , it has been proved in @xcite that the dof of the @xmath0-user miso bc collapses to one for isotropic fading if the transmitter can not acquire any information about csi . in terms of isotropic",
    "fading and no csit , similar dof degradation was further shown in mimo bc and ic @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , ia without csit , called _ blind ia _ , has been recently proposed in @xcite for a class of heterogeneous block fading models achieving larger dof than that achievable for the isotropic fading model .",
    "in addition , it was shown that blind ia obtains similar dof gain for a class of homogeneous block fading models @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "gou , wang , and jafar have first proposed a blind ia technique exploiting _",
    "reconfigurable antennas_. as shown in fig .",
    "[ reconfigurableantenna ] , reconfigurable antennas are capable of dynamically adjusting their radiation patterns in a controlled and reversible manner through various technologies such as solid state switches or microelectromechanical switches ( mems ) , which can be conceptually modeled as antenna selection that each rf - chain of reconfigurable antennas chooses one of receiving mode among several preset modes at each time instant , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section i ) for the concept of reconfigurable antennas . based on a remarkable observation that even for time - invariant channels ,",
    "reconfigurable antenna can artificially create channel matrices correlated across time in some specific structure , the authors in @xcite show that the optimal sum dof of the @xmath0-user @xmath2 miso bc is given by @xmath3 when each user is equipped with a reconfigurable antenna whose rf - chain can choose one receiving mode from @xmath4 preset modes .",
    "subsequently , in @xcite , the achievability result in @xcite is generalized to the @xmath0-user @xmath5 mimo bc where each user is equipped with a set of reconfigurable antennas whose rf - chains are able to choose @xmath6 receiving modes from @xmath4 preset modes , showing that the sum dof of @xmath7 is achievable .",
    "the idea of blind ia using reconfigurable antennas is further extended to ics consisting of receivers with reconfigurable antennas @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the _",
    "@xmath0-user mimo bc assuming a general reconfigurable antenna environment_. in particular , the transmitter is equipped with @xmath4 antennas and user @xmath8 , @xmath9 , is equipped with a set of reconfigurable antennas whose rf - chains can choose @xmath10 receiving modes from @xmath11 preset modes ( @xmath12 ) , which includes the conventional non - reconfigurable antenna model ( @xmath13 for this case ) .",
    "we focus on the _ linear dof ( ldof ) with no csit _ , i.e. , the maximum dof achievable by linear coding strategies with no csit , see also @xcite for the definition of ldof . for general antenna configurations ,",
    "we completely characterize the sum ldof of the @xmath0-user mimo bc with reconfigurable antennas in the absence of csit .",
    "we further characterize the ldof region for a specific class of antenna configurations .",
    "therefore , the main contributions of this paper are two - folds : 1 ) we generalize the previous achievability results in @xcite assuming a certain class of antenna configurations to general antenna configurations , 2 ) we show the converse of our achievable dof in the ldof sense , which implies that the achievability result in @xcite is also optimal in the ldof sense .",
    "our analysis is further applied to a class of @xmath0-user mimo ic with reconfigurable antennas and the sum ldof is characterized for a class of antenna configurations , which generalizes the achievable sum dof result in @xcite .",
