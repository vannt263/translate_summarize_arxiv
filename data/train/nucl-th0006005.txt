    "recently , there has been a revival of interest in the reaction @xmath1he(@xmath13,@xmath14)@xmath5he  @xcite .",
    "this interest has been spurred by the super - kamiokande collaboration measurements of the energy spectrum of electrons recoiling from scattering with solar neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "over most of the spectrum , a suppression @xmath15 is observed relative to the standard solar model ( ssm ) predictions  @xcite . above 12.5 mev",
    ", however , there is an apparent excess of events .",
    "the @xmath12 process , as the proton weak capture on @xmath1he is known , is the only source of solar neutrinos with energies larger than about 14 mev  their end - point energy is about 19 mev .",
    "this fact has naturally led to questions about the reliability of calculations of the @xmath12 weak capture cross section , upon which is based the currently accepted ssm value for the astrophysical @xmath0-factor at zero energy , @xmath16 kev  b  @xcite . in particular , bahcall and krastev have shown  @xcite that a large enhancement , by a factor in the range 2530 , of the ssm @xmath0-factor value given above would essentially fit the observed excess  @xcite of recoiling electrons , in any of three different neutrino scenarios  uniform suppression of the @xmath17b flux , vacuum oscillations , and matter - enhanced oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of the @xmath12 process , as well as that of the neutron and proton radiative captures on @xmath18h , @xmath1h , and @xmath1he , constitute a challenging problem from the standpoint of nuclear few - body theory .",
    "its difficulty can be appreciated by comparing the measured values for the cross section of thermal neutron radiative capture on @xmath19h , @xmath18h , and @xmath1he .",
    "their respective values are : @xmath20 mb  @xcite , @xmath21 mb  @xcite , and @xmath22 mb  @xcite .",
    "thus , in going from @xmath23=2 to 4 the cross section has dropped by almost four orders of magnitude .",
    "these processes are induced by magnetic - dipole transitions between the initial two - cluster state in relative s - wave and the final bound state .",
    "in fact , the inhibition of the @xmath23=3 and 4 captures has been understood for a long time  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1h and @xmath5he wave functions , denoted , respectively , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 are , to a good approximation , eigenfunctions of the magnetic dipole operator @xmath26 , namely @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29=2.793 n.m .",
    "is the proton magnetic moment ( note that the experimental value of the @xmath1h magnetic moment is 2.979 n.m . , while @xmath5he has no magnetic moment ) .",
    "these relations would be exact , if the @xmath1h and @xmath5he wave functions were to consist of a symmetric s - wave term only , for example , @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "of course , tensor components in the nuclear interactions generate significant d - state admixtures , that partially spoil this eigenstate property . to the extent that it is approximately satisfied , though , the matrix elements @xmath31 and @xmath32 vanish due to orthogonality between the initial and final states .",
    "this orthogonality argument fails in the case of the deuteron , since then @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are two - nucleon spin and isospin states , respectively .",
    "the magnetic dipole operator can therefore connect the large s - wave component @xmath36 of the deuteron to a @xmath37=1 @xmath19s@xmath38 @xmath39 state ( note that the orthogonality between the latter and the deuteron follows from the orthogonality between their respective spin - isospin states ) .",
    "this quasi - orthogonality , while again invalid in the case of the proton weak capture on protons , is also responsible for inhibiting the @xmath12 process .",
    "both these reactions are induced by the gamow - teller operator , which differs from the ( leading ) isovector spin part of the magnetic dipole operator essentially by an isospin rotation . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath12 weak capture and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42he , and @xmath4h radiative captures are extremely sensitive to : ( i ) small components in the wave functions , particularly the d - state admixtures generated by tensor interactions , and ( ii ) many - body terms in the electro - weak current operator . for example , two - body current contributions provide , respectively , 50 % and over 90 % of the calculated @xmath41  @xcite and @xmath42he  @xcite cross sections at very low energies .    in this respect ,",
    "the @xmath12 weak capture is a particularly delicate reaction , for two additional reasons : firstly and most importantly , the one- and two - body current contributions are comparable in magnitude , but of opposite sign  @xcite ; secondly , two - body axial currents , specifically those arising from excitation of @xmath43 isobars which have been shown to give the dominant contribution , are model dependent  @xcite .",
    "this destructive interference between one- and two - body currents also occurs in the @xmath42he ( @xmath44 ) radiative capture  @xcite , with the difference that there the leading components of the two - body currents are model independent , and give a much larger contribution than that associated with the one - body current .",
    "the cancellation in the @xmath12 process between the one- and two - body matrix elements has the effect of enhancing the importance of p - wave capture channels , which would ordinarily be suppressed . indeed ,",
    "one of the results of the present work is that these channels give about 40 % of the @xmath0-factor calculated value . that the @xmath12 process could proceed as easily through p- as s - wave capture was not realized  or , at least ,",
    "not sufficiently appreciated  @xcite  in all earlier studies of this reaction we are aware of , with the exception of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was suggested , on the basis of a very simple one - body reaction model , that the @xmath1p@xmath38 channel may be important .      the history of @xmath12 cross section calculations has been most recently reviewed by bahcall and krastev  @xcite .",
    "the first estimate of the cross section  @xcite was based on the calculation of the overlap of an s - wave proton continuum wave function and a 1s neutron wave function in @xmath5he .",
    "it produced a large value for the @xmath0-factor , @xmath45 kev  b , and led to the suggestion by kuzmin  @xcite that between 20 % and 50 % of the neutrinos in the high - energy end of the flux spectrum could originate from the @xmath12 reaction .",
    "of course , as already discussed above and originally pointed out by werntz and brennan  @xcite , if the @xmath5he and @xmath4he states are approximated , respectively , by ( 1s)@xmath5 and ( 1s)@xmath12s@xmath46 configurations ( 2s@xmath46 is the continuum wave function ) , and antisymmetrized in space , spin , and isospin , then the capture rate vanishes identically .",
    "werntz and brennan  @xcite attempted to relate the matrix element of the axial current occurring in the @xmath12 capture to that of the electromagnetic current occurring in the thermal neutron radiative capture on @xmath1he , and provided an upper limit for the @xmath12 @xmath0-factor , @xmath47 kev  b , based on an experimental upper limit of 100 @xmath48b for the @xmath1he(@xmath49,@xmath50)@xmath5he cross section known at the time .",
    "werntz and brennan assumed : ( i ) the validity of isospin symmetry , apart from differences in the neutron ( in @xmath44 capture ) and proton ( in @xmath12 capture ) continuum wave functions , which they related to each other via @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the usual gamow penetration factor ) ; ( ii ) that two - body currents dominated both the weak and radiative captures , and that their matrix elements could be put in relation to each other through an isospin rotation .",
    "these authors refined their earlier estimate for the @xmath12 @xmath0-factor in a later publication  @xcite , by using hard - sphere phase shifts to obtain a more realistic value for the ratio of the neutron to proton continuum wave functions , and by including the contributions due to p - wave capture channels .",
    "these refinements led to an @xmath0-factor value , @xmath53 kev  b , considerably larger than they had obtained previously .",
    "they found , though , that the p - waves only contribute at the 10 % level .",
    "subsequent studies of the @xmath12 process also attempted to relate it to the @xmath44 radiative capture , but recognized the importance of d - state components in the @xmath1he and @xmath5he wave functions  these had been ignored in refs .",
    "@xcite , and used the chemtob - rho prescription  @xcite ( with some short - range modification ) for the two - body terms in the electroweak current operator .",
    "tegnr and bargholtz  @xcite and wervelman _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite found , using a shell - model description of the initial and final states , that two - body current contributions do not dominate the capture processes , in sharp contrast with the assumptions of refs .",
    "@xcite and the later conclusions of refs .",
    "these two groups as well as wolfs _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite arrived , nevertheless , to contradictory results , due to the different values calculated for the ratio of weak to electromagnetic matrix elements .",
    "tegnr and bargholtz  @xcite obtained an @xmath0-factor value of @xmath54 kev  b , the spread being due to the uncertain experimental value of the thermal neutron capture cross section before 1983 .",
    "this prediction was sharpened by wolfs _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who measured the @xmath44 cross section precisely .",
    "they quoted an @xmath12 @xmath0-factor value of @xmath55 kev  b. wervelman _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite also measured the @xmath44 cross section , reporting a value of @xmath56 @xmath48b in excellent agreement with the wolfs _",
    "measurement of @xmath57 @xmath48b , but estimated an @xmath12 @xmath0-factor in the range @xmath58 kev  b. these discrepancies are presumably due to the schematic wave functions used in the calculations .    in an attempt to reduce the uncertainties in the predicted values for both",
    "the radiative and weak capture rates , fully microscopic calculations of these reactions were performed in the early nineties  @xcite , based on ground- and scattering - state wave functions obtained variationally from a realistic hamiltonian with two- and three - nucleon interactions . the main part of the electromagnetic current operator ( denoted as model independent ) was constructed consistently from the two - nucleon interaction model . the less well known ( model dependent ) electroweak currents associated with the excitation of intermediate @xmath43 isobars and with transition couplings , such as the electromagnetic or axial @xmath59 current , were also included .",
    "however , it was emphasized that their contribution was to be viewed as numerically uncertain , as very little empirical information is available on their coupling constants and short - range behavior .",
    "these studies showed that both the @xmath44 and @xmath12 reactions have large ( in the case of the radiative capture , dominant ) contributions from two - body currents .",
    "indeed , the values obtained with one - body only and full currents for the @xmath12 @xmath0-factor ( radiative capture cross section ) were , respectively , @xmath60 and @xmath61 kev  b ( 6 and 112 @xmath48b ) .",
    "these results indicated that the common practice of inferring the @xmath12 @xmath0-factor from the measured radiative capture cross section is bound to be misleading , because of different initial - state interactions in the @xmath42he and @xmath4he channels , and because of the large contributions associated with the two - body components of the electroweak current operator , and their destructive interference with the one - body current contributions . yet , the substantial overprediction of the @xmath44 cross section , 112 @xmath48b versus an experimental value of 55 @xmath48b , was unsatisfactory .",
    "it became clear that the contributions of the model dependentcurrents , particularly those due to the @xmath43 isobar , were unreasonably large ( about 40 @xmath48b out of the total 112 @xmath48b ) .",
    "it was therefore deemed necessary to include the @xmath43 degrees of freedom explicitly in the nuclear wave functions , rather than eliminate them in favor of effective two - body operators acting on nucleon coordinates , as it had been done in earlier studies .",
    "this led to the development of the transition - correlation operator ( tco ) method  @xcite  a scaled - down approach to a full @xmath62+@xmath43 coupled - channel treatment .",
    "the radiative capture cross section was now calculated to be between 75 and 80 @xmath48b  @xcite ( excluding the small contribution of the uncertain@xmath63 current ) , the spread depending on whether the @xmath64@xmath62@xmath43 coupling constant in the transition interactions is taken either from experiment or from the quark model . in this approach",
    ", the @xmath12 @xmath0-factor was calculated to be in the range between @xmath65 and @xmath66 kev  b  @xcite , the spread due to whether the axial @xmath62@xmath43 coupling was determined by fitting the gamow - teller matrix element in tritium @xmath67-decay or , again , taken from the quark model ( uncertainties in the values of the @xmath64@xmath62@xmath43 coupling had a much smaller impact ) .",
    "in fact , the ssm value for the @xmath12 @xmath0-factor now quoted in the literature  @xcite is the average of these last two results .",
    "improvements in the modeling of two- and three - nucleon interactions and the nuclear weak current , and the significant progress made in the last few years in the description of the bound and continuum four - nucleon wave functions , have prompted us to re - examine the @xmath12 reaction .",
    "the nuclear hamiltonian has been taken to consist of the argonne @xmath3 two - nucleon  @xcite and urbana - ix three - nucleon  @xcite interactions . to make contact with the earlier studies  @xcite , however , and to have some estimate of the model dependence of the results , the older argonne @xmath2 two - nucleon  @xcite and urbana - viii three - nucleon  @xcite interaction models have also been used .",
    "both these hamiltonians , the av18/uix and av14/uviii , reproduce the experimental binding energies and charge radii of the trinucleons and @xmath5he in exact green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) calculations  @xcite .    the correlated - hyperspherical - harmonics ( chh ) method is used here to solve variationally the bound- and scattering - state four - nucleon problem  @xcite .",
    "the binding energy of @xmath5he calculated with the chh method  @xcite is within 12 % , depending on the hamiltonian model , of that obtained with the gfmc method .",
    "the accuracy of the chh method to calculate scattering states has been successfully verified in the case of the trinucleon systems , by comparing results for a variety of @xmath68 scattering observables obtained by a number of groups using different techniques  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the numerical uncertainties in the calculation of the trinucleon continuum have been so drastically reduced that @xmath68 scattering observables can now be used to directly study the sensitivity to two- and three - nucleon interaction models  the @xmath69 puzzleconstitutes an excellent example of this type of studies  @xcite .",
    "studies along similar lines show  @xcite that the chh solutions for the four - nucleon continuum are also highly accurate .",
    "the chh predictions  @xcite for the @xmath42h total elastic cross section , @xmath70 , and coherent scattering length , @xmath71 , measured by neutron interferometry techniques@xmath72 and @xmath73 are the singlet and triplet scattering lengths  have been found to be in excellent agreement with the corresponding experimental values .",
    "the @xmath42h cross section is known over a rather wide energy range , and its extrapolation to zero energy is not problematic  @xcite .",
    "the situation is different for the @xmath4he channel , for which the scattering lengths have been determined from effective range extrapolations of data taken above 1 mev , and are therefore somewhat uncertain , @xmath74 fm  @xcite and @xmath75 fm  @xcite or @xmath76 fm  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the chh results are close to the experimental values above . for example",
    ", the av18/uix hamiltonian predicts  @xcite @xmath77 fm and @xmath78 fm .    in refs .",
    "@xcite variational monte carlo ( vmc ) wave functions had been used to describe both bound and scattering states .",
    "the triplet scattering length was found to be 10.1 fm with the av14/uviii hamiltonian model , in satisfactory agreement with the experimental determination and the value obtained with the more accurate chh wave functions .",
    "however , the present work includes all s- and p - wave channels , namely @xmath19s@xmath38 , @xmath1s@xmath79 , @xmath1p@xmath38 , @xmath19p@xmath79 , @xmath1p@xmath79 , and @xmath1p@xmath80 , while all previous works only retained the @xmath1s@xmath79 channel , which was thought , erroneously , to be the dominant one .",
    "the nuclear weak current consists of vector and axial - vector parts , with corresponding one- , two- , and many - body components .",
    "the weak vector current is constructed from the isovector part of the electromagnetic current , in accordance with the conserved - vector - current ( cvc ) hypothesis .",
    "two - body weak vector currents have model - independentand model - dependentcomponents .",
    "the model - independent terms are obtained from the nucleon - nucleon interaction , and by construction satisfy current conservation with it .",
    "the leading two - body weak vector current is the @xmath64-likeoperator , obtained from the isospin - dependent spin - spin and tensor nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the latter also generate an isovector @xmath81-likecurrent , while additional isovector two - body currents arise from the isospin - independent and isospin - dependent central and momentum - dependent interactions .",
    "these currents are short - ranged , and numerically far less important than the @xmath64-like current . with the exception of the @xmath81-like current ,",
    "they have been neglected in the present work .",
    "the model - dependent currents are purely transverse , and therefore can not be directly linked to the underlying two - nucleon interaction .",
    "the present calculation includes the isovector currents associated with excitation of @xmath43 isobars which , however , are found to give a rather small contribution in weak - vector transitions , as compared to that due to the @xmath64-like current .",
    "the @xmath64-like and @xmath81-like weak vector charge operators have also been retained in the present study .    the leading two- and many - body terms in the axial current , in contrast to the case of the weak vector ( or electromagnetic ) current , are those due to @xmath43-isobar excitation , which are treated within the tco scheme .",
    "this scheme has in fact been extended  @xcite to include three - body connected terms which were neglected in the earlier work  @xcite .",
    "the axial charge operator includes the long - range pion - exchange term  @xcite , required by low - energy theorems and the partially - conserved - axial - current relation , as well as the ( expected ) leading short - range terms constructed from the central and spin - orbit components of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , following a prescription due to riska and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "the largest model dependence is in the weak axial current . to minimize it , the poorly known @xmath82 transition",
    "axial coupling constant has been adjusted to reproduce the experimental value of the gamow - teller matrix element in tritium @xmath67-decay . while this procedure is inherently model dependent , its actual model dependence is in fact very weak , as has been shown in ref .",
    "the analysis carried out there could be extended to the present case .",
    "we present here a discussion of the results for the astrophysical @xmath0-factor and their implications for the super - kamiokande ( sk ) solar neutrino spectrum .      our results for the astrophysical @xmath0-factor , defined as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the @xmath12 cross section at center - of - mass energy @xmath85",
    ", @xmath86 is the @xmath4he relative velocity , and @xmath87 is the fine structure constant , are reported in table  [ tb : sfact ] . by inspection of the table , we note that : ( i ) the energy dependence is rather weak : the value at @xmath6 kev is only about 4 % larger than that at @xmath88 kev ; ( ii ) the p - wave capture states are found to be important , contributing about 40 % of the calculated @xmath0-factor . however , the contributions from d - wave channels are expected to be very small .",
    "we have verified explicitly that they are indeed small in @xmath1d@xmath79 capture .",
    "( iii ) the many - body axial currents associated with @xmath43 excitation play a crucial role in the ( dominant ) @xmath1s@xmath79 capture , where they reduce the @xmath0-factor by more than a factor of four ; thus the destructive interference between the one- and many - body current contributions , first obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , is confirmed in the present study , based on more accurate wave functions .",
    "the ( suppressed ) one - body contribution comes mostly from transitions involving the d - state components of the @xmath1he and @xmath5he wave functions , while the many - body contributions are predominantly due to transitions connecting the s - state in @xmath1he to the d - state in @xmath5he , or viceversa .",
    "it is important to stress the differences between the present and all previous studies .",
    "apart from ignoring , or at least underestimating , the contribution due to p - waves , the latter only considered the long - wavelength form of the weak multipole operators , namely , their @xmath89=@xmath88 limit , where @xmath89 is the magnitude of the momentum transfer . in @xmath1p@xmath38 capture , for example , only the @xmath52-multipole , associated with the weak axial charge , survives in this limit , and the corresponding @xmath0-factor is calculated to be @xmath90 kev  b , including two - body contributions . however , when the transition induced by the longitudinal component of the axial current ( via the @xmath91-multipole , which vanishes at @xmath89=@xmath88 ) is also taken into account , the @xmath0-factor becomes @xmath92 kev  b , because of destructive interference between the @xmath52 and @xmath91 matrix elements ( see discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : xs ] ) .",
    "thus use of the long - wavelength approximation in the calculation of the @xmath12 cross section leads to inaccurate results .    finally , besides the differences listed above",
    ", the present calculation also improves that of ref .",
    "@xcite in a number of other important respects : firstly , it uses chh wave functions , corresponding to the latest generation of realistic interactions ; secondly , the model for the nuclear weak current has been extended to include the axial charge as well as the vector charge and current operators .",
    "thirdly , the one - body operators now take into account the @xmath93 relativistic corrections , which had previously been neglected . in @xmath1s@xmath79 capture , for example , these terms increase by 25 % the dominant ( but suppressed ) @xmath94 and @xmath95 matrix elements calculated with the ( lowest order ) gamow - teller operator . these improvements in the treatment of the one - body axial current indirectly affect also the contributions of the @xmath43-excitation currents , since the @xmath96 transition axial coupling constant is determined by reproducing the gamow - teller matrix element in tritium @xmath67-decay , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : vadlt ] below",
    ".    the chief conclusion of the present work is that the @xmath12 @xmath0-factor is predicted to be @xmath8 4.5 times larger than the value adopted in the ssm .",
    "this enhancement , while very significant , is smaller than that first suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , and then reconsidered by the sk collaboration in ref .",
    "a discussion of the implications of our results for the sk solar neutrino spectrum is given below .",
    "even though our result is inherently model dependent , it is unlikely that the model dependence is large enough to accommodate a drastic increase in the value obtained here .",
    "indeed , calculations using hamiltonians based on the av18 two - nucleon interaction only and the older av14/uviii two- and three - nucleon interactions predict zero energy @xmath0-factor values of @xmath97 kev  b and @xmath98 kev  b , respectively .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the av18 model , in contrast to the av14/uviii , does not reproduce the experimental binding energies and low - energy scattering parameters of the three- and four - nucleon systems .",
    "the av14/uviii prediction is only 6 % larger than the av18/uix zero - energy result .",
    "this 6 % variation should provide a fairly realistic estimate of the theoretical uncertainty due to the model dependence .",
    "it would be very valuable , though , to repeat the present study with a hamiltonian consisting of the cd - bonn interaction  @xcite which , in contrast to the av14 and av18 models , has strongly non - local central and tensor components .",
    "we would expect the cd - bonn calculation to predict an @xmath0-factor value close to that reported here , provided the axial current in that calculation were again constrained to reproduce the known gamow - teller matrix element in tritium @xmath67-decay  @xcite .    to conclude , our best estimate for the @xmath0-factor at 10 kev c.m .",
    "energy is therefore @xmath99 kev  b.      super - kamiokande ( sk ) detects solar neutrinos by neutrino - electron scattering .",
    "the energy is shared between the outgoing neutrino and scattered electron , leading to a very weak correlation between the incoming neutrino energy and the measured electron energy .",
    "the electron angle relative to the solar direction is also measured , which would in principle allow reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy . however , the kinematic range of the angle is very forward , and is comparable to the angular resolution of the detector .",
    "furthermore , event - by - event reconstruction of the neutrino energy would be prevented by the detector background . above its threshold of several mev ,",

    "these have a total flux of @xmath100 @xmath101 s@xmath102 in the ssm  @xcite . while the flux is uncertain to about 15 % , primarily due to the nuclear - physics uncertainties in the @xmath103be(@xmath13,@xmath50)@xmath17b cross section , the spectral shape is more precisely known  @xcite .",
    "the sk results are presented as the ratio of the measured electron spectrum to that expected in the ssm with no neutrino oscillations . over most of the spectrum ,",

    "the currents induced by the momentum dependent components of the interactions , such as the spin - orbit term , have been neglected .",
    "thus the ratio obtained in the calculation is 1.34 for the @xmath19p@xmath79 channel , somewhat smaller than the expected value presumably because of the missingcurrents and the approximate eigenstate property satisfied by the present chh ( variational ) wave functions .",

    "[ tb : sfc_contr ] we list , for all s- and p - wave channels , the @xmath0-factor values obtained with the av18/uix , av18 , and av14/uviii interactions .",

    "the @xmath62@xmath43 axial coupling constant is determined by fitting the gamow - teller matrix element in tritium @xmath67-decay , within each given hamiltonian model . as a result of this procedure the model dependence of the @xmath0-factor predictions",
    "is substantially reduced .",
    "inspection of table  [ tb : sfc_contr ] shows that inclusion of the three - nucleon interaction reduces the total @xmath0-factor by about 20 % ( compare the av18 and av18/uix results ) .",
    "this decrease is mostly in the @xmath1s@xmath79 contribution , and can be traced back to a corresponding reduction in the magnitude of the one - body axial current matrix elements .",
    "the latter are sensitive to the triplet scattering length , for which the av18 and av18/uix models predict , respectively , 10.0 fm and 9.13 fm ( see table  [ tb : scl ] ) .",
    "the comparison between the av18/uix and av14/uviii models , which both reproduce the measured bound - state properties and low - energy scattering parameters of the three- and four - nucleon systems , suggests a rather weak model dependence .",
    "it is important to reiterate that this is accomplished by virtue of the procedure used to constrain the axial current .",
    "indeed , the av18/uix and av14/uviii @xmath1s@xmath79 contributions to the @xmath0-factor obtained with one - body currents only are , respectively , @xmath698 kev  b and @xmath699 kev  b. this difference is presumably due to the stronger tensor component of av14 as compared to that of av18 .    finally , the @xmath1s@xmath79 contribution to the @xmath0-factor obtained with the av14/uviii model in the present work , @xmath700 kev  b , is to be compared with the older prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath701 kev  b. it is important to point out that the older calculation ( i ) used the long - wavelength form of the @xmath259 and @xmath260 operators , ( ii ) ignored the contributions of transitions induced by the axial charge and vector current , ( iii ) retained only the leading non - relativistic ( gamow - teller ) term of the single - nucleon axial current , and ( iv ) employed bound and continuum wave functions , obtained with the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method . in regard to this last point , we note that , for example , the @xmath702 rme calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite with the gamow - teller operator is @xmath703 @xmath247 versus a value of 0.119 @xmath247 obtained here .",

    "<S> the astrophysical @xmath0-factor for the proton weak capture on @xmath1he is calculated with correlated - hyperspherical - harmonics bound and continuum wave functions corresponding to realistic hamiltonians consisting of the argonne @xmath2 or argonne @xmath3 two - nucleon and urbana - viii or urbana - ix three - nucleon interactions . the nuclear weak charge and current operators have vector and axial - vector components , that include one- and many - body terms . </S>",
    "<S> all possible multipole transitions connecting any of the @xmath4he s- and p - wave channels to the @xmath5he bound state are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-factor at a @xmath4he center - of - mass energy of @xmath6 kev , close to the gamow - peak energy , is predicted to be @xmath7 kev  b with the av18/uix hamiltonian , a factor of @xmath8 4.5 larger than the value adopted in the standard solar model . </S>",
    "<S> the p - wave transitions are found to be important , contributing about 40 % of the calculated @xmath0-factor . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence is rather weak : the av18/uix zero - energy @xmath0-factor is @xmath9 kev  b , only 5 % smaller than the 10 kev result quoted above . </S>",
    "<S> the model dependence is also found to be weak : the zero - energy @xmath0-factor is calculated to be @xmath10 kev  b with the older av14/uviii model , only 6 % larger than the av18/uix result . our best estimate for the @xmath0-factor at 10 kev is therefore @xmath11 kev  b , when the theoretical uncertainty due to the model dependence is included . </S>",
    "<S> this value for the calculated @xmath0-factor is not as large as determined in fits to the super - kamiokande data in which the @xmath12 flux normalization is free . </S>",
    "<S> however , the precise calculation of the @xmath0-factor and the consequent absolute prediction for the @xmath12 neutrino flux will allow much greater discrimination among proposed solar neutrino oscillation solutions . </S>"
