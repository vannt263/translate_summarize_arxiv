    "0.5 cm    there has been some discussion lately about the gauge hierarchy problem@xcite .",
    "we would like to contribute to this discussion by suggesting the following rather simple solution : if the scale of new physics is @xmath1 then a gauge hierarchy can be avoided provided that @xmath1 is not too different from the weak scale , @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests the following rough upper limit @xmath3 we prefer to exclude gravity from our discussion for the obvious reason that it is not a well understood quantum theory . despite the large value of @xmath4 it is not clear whether this poses a fine - tuning problem or not .",
    "the mere existence of the two disparate scales @xmath2 and @xmath5 does not _ necessarily _ imply a fine - tuning problem , just like the existence of the disparate scales @xmath6 and @xmath2 does not imply a fine tuning problem in the standard model .",
    "thus , we argue that so long as @xmath7 the gauge hierarchy problem can be avoided .",
    "of course it should also be emphasised that the condition , eq.([1 ] ) is of great practical importance since it means that the theory can be subject to many experimental tests ( in principle ) .",
    "given the rather stringent requirement , eq.([1 ] ) , one might imagine that there is no new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we argue that this is unlikely for at least three reasons :    1 .",
    "there is experimental and theoretical evidence for neutrino masses .",
    "the experimental evidence comes from the neutrino physics anomalies ( such as the atmospheric , solar , lsnd anomalies ) , while the theoretical evidence comes from the electric charge quantization problem of the minimal standard model@xcite ; 2 .",
    "each generation contains five distinct fermionic gauge multiplets ; 3 .",
    "the standard model is a bit ugly because it contains @xmath8 theoretically unconstrained parameters .",
    "let us first remark that the model to be discussed in this paper has many more parameters than the standard model , so that we have certainly not made any progress on the parameter problem .",
    "however the model does partially address the other two points identified above .",
    "one of the reasons that each generation contains five distinct fermion multiplets is that the quarks and the leptons are similar but lack any real symmetry in the standard model .",
    "thus one obvious way to improve on this is to embed the standard model into a gauge model with a symmetry between the quarks and the leptons . given the constraint , eq.([1 ] ) there are only two possibilities that we are aware of .",
    "the first tev scale quark - lepton unified model was proposed in ref.@xcite where a leptonic @xmath9 colour group was assumed so that a discrete @xmath10 quark - lepton symmetry can be defined ( the @xmath9 gauge symmetry is assumed to be spontaneously broken at the tev scale ) .",
    "more recently , one of us@xcite has also shown that it is possible to modify the usual pati - salam model@xcite such that the quarks and the leptons can be unified with gauge group @xmath0 at the low scale of about a tev . ] .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic study of this alternative @xmath0 model ( or 422 model for short ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section ii we review the basic structure of the alternative @xmath11 model . in section iii",
    "we investigate nucleon decay in this model .",
    "as already noted in ref.@xcite , gauge interactions conserve a global baryon number , however this symmetry can be broken by scalar interactions in the higgs potential .",
    "we show that the effect of the scalar mediated nucleon decay is to induce neutron decay @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 ) .",
    "we provide a rough estimate of this decay rate which we show is consistent with a tev symmetry breaking scale . in section",
    "iv we discuss rare @xmath14 meson decays .",
    "these decays provide the main experimental bound on the model . in section v we discuss neutrino masses in the model which are naturally small , despite the tev symmetry breaking scale . in section",
    "vi we conclude .",
    "in this section , we review the alternative @xmath15 model . for more details see ref.@xcite .",
    "the gauge symmetry of the model is @xmath16 under this gauge symmetry the fermions of each generation transform in the anomaly free representations : @xmath17 the minimal choice of scalar multiplets which can both break the gauge symmetry correctly and give all of the charged fermions mass is @xmath18 these scalars couple to the fermions as follows , although such a term is allowed by the gauge symmetry of the model .",
    "we assume that @xmath19 so that it can be neglected .",
    "this is not unreasonable , since the bare mass scale is completely independent of the weak scale . ] : @xmath20 where the generation index has been suppressed and @xmath21 . under the @xmath22 subgroup of @xmath23 , the @xmath24 representation has the branching rule , @xmath25 .",
    "we will assume that the @xmath26 components of @xmath27 gain non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) as well as the @xmath28 and @xmath29 components of the @xmath30 .",
    "we denote these vevs by @xmath31 respectively . in other words , @xmath32 we will assume that the vevs satisfy @xmath33 so that the symmetry is broken as follows : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the linear combination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 which annihilates @xmath38 ( i.e. @xmath39 ) .",
    "the difference is just a @xmath40 rotation . ] . observe that in the limit where @xmath41 , the model reduces to the standard model .",
    "the vev @xmath42 breaks the gauge symmetry to the standard model subgroup .",
    "this vev also gives large @xmath43 invariant masses to an @xmath44 doublet of exotic fermions , which have electric charges @xmath45 .",
    "we will denote these exotic fermions with the notation @xmath46 .",
    "these exotic fermions must have masses greater than about @xmath47 otherwise they would contribute to the @xmath48 width .",
    "observe that the right - handed chiral components of the usual charged leptons are contained in @xmath49 .",
    "they are the @xmath50 components .",
    "the usual left - handed leptons are contained in @xmath51 along with the right - handed components ( cp conjugated ) of @xmath52 .",
    "it is instructive to write out the fermion multiplets explicitly .",
    "for the first generation , @xmath53 and similarly for the second and third generations . in the above",
    "matrices the first column of @xmath54 @xmath55 is the @xmath56 component while the second column is the @xmath57 component .",
    "the four rows of @xmath58 are the four colours and the rows of @xmath51 are the @xmath59 components .",
    "observe that the vevs @xmath60 have the quantum numbers @xmath61 ( or equivalently @xmath62 ) .",
    "this means that the standard model subgroup , @xmath63 is broken to @xmath64 in the usual way ( with @xmath65 ) .",
    "one of the main constraints on unified models is the empirical limit on nucleon decay .",
    "baryon charge in the alternative @xmath15 model is defined as @xmath68 where the @xmath69 charges of @xmath70 are all + 1 and the @xmath69 charges of @xmath71 are 0 .",
    "( the @xmath69 charges of the gauge bosons are also 0 ) .",
    "this baryon charge is conserved by the gauge interactions and yukawa lagrangian , eq.([4 ] ) .",
    "( while @xmath69 and @xmath36 are both broken by the vacuum , the combination @xmath72 is unbroken , since @xmath73 ) ] of the quarks is @xmath74 and the baryon charge of the leptons is @xmath75 .",
    "also it is straightforward to check that the baryon charge of the @xmath63 gauge bosons are also zero . ] .",
    "thus , the only part of the lagrangian which can potentially mediate nucleon decay is the higgs potential .",
    "it is quite easy to see that the only gauge invariant and renormalizable terms in the higgs potential which break the @xmath76 symmetry are @xmath77 where the @xmath78 quantum numbers have been explicitly shown as superscripts . from eq.([4 ] ) the colour triplet components of the @xmath79 interact with the fermions as follows , @xmath80 thus , the higgs potential term which leads to the most significant nucleon decay is expected to be primarily mediates @xmath81 ( ddd ) decay , while @xmath82 terms can mediate nucleon decay but are suppressed because the @xmath83 state couples to the weak - eigenstate @xmath84 ( which contains only a tiny admixture of the light @xmath85 mass eigenstates ) . ]",
    "@xmath86 where we have made the @xmath87 indices explicit [ @xmath88 .",
    "this term mediates neutron decay via the feynman diagram in figure 1 .",
    "the matrix element will contain a term for the propagator of each scalar @xmath89 which will contribute a factor of @xmath90 .",
    "thus the matrix element will be proportional to @xmath91 and the decay time , being proportional to the inverse square of the matrix element will be of the form ; @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the dimensionless coupling constants from the interaction lagrangian eq.([4 ] ) , @xmath95 is from the trilinear scalar interaction term , eq.([uu ] ) .",
    "the neutron mass @xmath96 has been introduced as a dimensional factor because we are studying neutron decay .",
    "observe that the @xmath94 yukawa coupling is proportional to the electron mass , so that @xmath97 .",
    "strictly , the only information that we know about @xmath98 is that @xmath99 , so that the most natural value for @xmath94 is @xmath100 .",
    "thus , with this in mind , we have @xmath101 the current experimental bound on the ( bound ) neutron decay mode @xmath102 is @xmath103 at 90% c.l.@xcite .",
    "this bound suggests @xmath104 , which is not a very stringent limit .",
    "thus , clearly this model is not significantly constrained by current limits on nucleon decay .",
    "obviously , if a @xmath105 signal were to be experimentally observed , then this would be compatible with this model .",
    "finally , note that we have implicitly assumed that the scalars @xmath106 coupled the first generation quarks , @xmath107 with the first generation leptons @xmath108 .",
    "it is possible that this is not the case .",
    "if the scalars @xmath106 coupled the first generation quarks , @xmath109 with the second generation leptons @xmath110 then the decay @xmath111 would be the dominant decay mode .",
    "note that the decay rate for this mode might be somewhat larger due to the larger @xmath94 .",
    "the experimental bound is only slightly weaker , @xmath112 at 90% c.l.@xcite so the bound on @xmath113 is somewhat stronger , but certainly can not exclude a symmetry breaking scale of the order of a tev .",
    "in the alternative @xmath15 model the right handed leptons belong to the same multiplet as the right handed quarks .",
    "this means that there will be gauge interactions of the form ; @xmath114 where the latin index is a family index ( so that @xmath115 etc , ) , the @xmath116 is the coloured electrically charged 2/3 vector gauge boson and @xmath117 is a c.k.m . type matrix . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was shown that an approximately diagonal @xmath118 matrix , @xmath119 would lead to @xmath120 decay faster than the experimental limit unless @xmath121 . however , as was discussed in ref.@xcite there in no compelling reason why @xmath118 must be diagonal , and it was shown that if @xmath118 had the approximate form , @xmath122 then the primary constraint on the model is from @xmath123 rare decays matrices have also been studied in the context of the usual pati - salam type model , see ref.@xcite . ] . in this case",
    "the experimental bound on the @xmath23 symmetry breaking scale is much weaker , @xmath124@xcite .",
    "our purpose now is to examine all possible forms for the matrix @xmath118 which can lead to such low symmetry breaking scales . as discussed already in the introduction , a tev symmetry breaking scale",
    "is theoretically suggested to avoid a gauge hierarchy and also to make the model accessible to experiments .",
    "clearly , the rare decays @xmath125 must be suppressed sufficiently for a tev symmetry breaking scale to occur , and this implies that the only possible ( approximate ) forms for @xmath118 are ; @xmath126    if @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) then the rare decays @xmath129 are avoided because the @xmath130 connects either the @xmath131 quark or @xmath132 quark with the tau lepton . however , as we will discuss in detail in a moment , in each case rare @xmath133 decays will occur .",
    "the relevant experimental limits are ( at 90% c.l.)@xcite , @xmath134 we now discuss the four possible cases @xmath127 in turn : 0.5 cm 1 ) if the @xmath135 then the @xmath136 and @xmath137 may occur , which are mediated by the following feynman diagrams ,    ( 80,23)(-20,0 ) ( 5,5)(1,0)28 ( 5,15)(1,0)28 ( 20,5)(0,1)10 ( 32,4.1)@xmath138 ( 32,14.1)@xmath139 ( 0,4.1)@xmath140 ( 0,14.1)@xmath141 ( 19,8.5)@xmath142 ( 21,8.5)@xmath143 ( 55,5)(1,0)28 ( 55,15)(1,0)28 ( 70,5)(0,1)10 ( 82,4.1)@xmath144 ( 82,14.1)@xmath139 ( 50,4.1)@xmath140 ( 50,14.1)@xmath141 ( 69,8.5)@xmath142 ( 71,8.5)@xmath143    the decay rate for @xmath145 , assuming maximal @xmath146 production for @xmath147 , is calculated from the above feynman diagram .",
    "this diagram corresponds ( after a fierz rearrangement ) to the following effective 4 fermion lagrangian density , @xmath148 where @xmath149 . from this effective lagrangian density",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the decay rate , @xmath150 evaluating this using @xmath151 , @xmath152 and using the measured total decay rate , we find the branching fraction , @xmath153 thus , from the experimental limits , eq.([br ] ) we see that @xmath154 .",
    "similar bounds also occur for other values of @xmath155 .",

    "the @xmath186 gain masses from the large vev @xmath42 and are expected to be quite heavy ( experimentally we know that they must be heavier than about @xmath187 ) . while the approximately sterile ( i.e. @xmath43 singlet ) @xmath188 states gain masses by mixing with the @xmath84 leptons ( see below for more details ) . at tree level the ordinary neutrinos ( i.e. the @xmath189 states )",
    "are massless .",
    "this is quite easy to see , because the masses of the fermions arise from the lagrangian density eq.([4 ] ) , and the @xmath189 states do not couple to any vev .    in order to gain insight into the neutrino masses ,",
    "let us first consider the toy case of just one generation , with just the usual first generation states ( together with the exotic @xmath84 leptons ) . in this case the tree level neutrino mass matrix , which can be obtained from eq.([4 ] ) , has the form : @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath192 thus , at the tree level the ordinary neutrino @xmath189 is massless .",
