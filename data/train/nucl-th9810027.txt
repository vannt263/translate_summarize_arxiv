    "the photoproduction of @xmath5-mesons on deuterium is an extremely interesting process .",
    "while the incoherent reaction is studied with the main motivation to get information on the neutron amplitude in quasifree kinematics , the coherent process is considered as an isospin filter in order to study the isoscalar properties of @xmath6-nucleon resonances . moreover",
    ", it offers the possibility to study rescattering and other medium effects . in view of quark model predictions for a small ratio @xmath7 of isoscalar over proton amplitude in conjunction with a further suppression due to a large energy - momentum mismatch ,",
    "a very small total cross section for the coherent process compared to the incoherent one was expected .",
    "thus it was quite a surprise that the first data of anderson and prepost @xcite were considerably above this simple estimate and seemed to indicate either a larger ratio or strong rescattering effects as estimated by hoshi et al .",
    "this somewhat contradictory situation has changed in recent years .",
    "firstly , more reliable though still approximate evaluations within the kerman - mcmanus - thaler formalism @xcite gave much smaller rescattering effects than the one of @xcite .",
    "secondly , new data became available @xcite which are much lower than the data of @xcite though still somewhat higher than expected from the small ratio @xmath7 as extracted from new data of incoherent @xmath5-production on deuterium @xcite which were also analyzed in @xcite .",
    "for these reasons it appears timely to study rescattering and other two - body effects in a more reliable way .",
    "the present treatment differs from previous work in essentially two aspects .",
    "first of all , we do not use an effective lagrangian model for the elementary eta production amplitude , fixing the undetermined parameters by fitting experimental @xmath5-production data .",
    "rather we use a simple , separable resonance model for the coupled system of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 reactions as developed by bennhold and tanabe @xcite where the resonance parameters are fitted to pion - nucleon scattering and pion photoproduction only .",
    "having thus fixed the model parameters , one can make predictions for eta photoproduction on the proton .",
    "this is described in sect .",
    "[ elem ] . secondly ,",
    "rescattering effects are treated for the first time in a coupled channel model .",
    "furthermore , we also include static two - body @xmath11- and @xmath5-meson exchange current contributions .",
    "this is described in sect .",
    "[ coh ] where also the results are presented .",
    "we close with a short summary and outlook .",
    "instead of viewing the resonance parameters entering the elementary @xmath12 amplitude as free parameters to be fitted to experimental observables of eta photoproduction , we would like to see , whether one can fix all parameters entering our calculation beforehand .",
    "to this end , we first will consider the process @xmath13 with the intention to fix the electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "parameters of the resonances , which we will treat in a simple separable resonance model as used previously by bennhold and tanabe @xcite , henceforth referred to as bt . within this model the coupling of the different physical channels @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16",
    "is generated effectively by the self energy @xmath17 of the resonances , that is through the evaluation of @xmath18 and @xmath19 loops . a genuine coupled channel calculation , as e.g.  in @xcite ,",
    "would be of course much more ambitious but also much more involved .",
    "nonetheless , in view of the fact that one usually has to apply certain approximations when incorporating the elementary amplitudes into a nuclear system , we have refrained from a coupled channel approach in the hope that this simple bt model already contains the essential features of the underlying dynamics .",
    "we take directly the hadronic parameters from @xcite and thus their description of the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 reactions .",
    "but we will not take the e.m .",
    "vertices parametrized in @xcite , simply because one can not separate the resonant contribution from the non - resonant background and we would like to have the possibility to adjust the e.m.pionic born terms in order to fit the experimental pion production multipoles .",
    "therefore , we take the standard lagrangians , as e.g.  in @xcite , and derive the non - relativistic vertex functions @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the photon momentum and @xmath22 the photon energy , and repeat the fitting procedure of @xcite obtaining thus effective , energy - dependent , and complex e.m .",
    "couplings . these may be viewed as @xmath23 form factors , reflecting the internal e.m.structure of the resonances .",
    "they are defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the @xmath13 multipole to which a given resonance @xmath26 contributes , @xmath27 the isospin quantum number , with @xmath28 corresponding to isoscalar excitation in the @xmath29 multipoles , and @xmath30 to the isovector excitation in the @xmath31 multipoles .",
    "@xmath32 denotes the experimental value of the multipole taken from @xcite , @xmath33 the born multipole , and @xmath34 the theoretical parametrization of the resonant multipole .    for the born terms we use in pv - coupling the direct and crossed nucleon pole graphs , the z - graphs , kroll - ruderman term , pion pole terms , vertex currents ( restoring gauge invariance ) , and the vector meson exchange graphs .",
    "we take the parameters for the latter ones from @xcite . at each @xmath18 vertex",
    "we insert a form factor @xmath35^{-1 } ,          \\quad \\lambda_{\\pi{}n}=600\\;\\mbox{mev}\\,.\\label{fpi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we evaluate ( [ effcoupl ] ) for every discrete energy of the experimental data set yielding thus the effective coupling first at every data point .",
    "then , because we need the couplings as a function of the invariant mass @xmath36 , we have fitted polynomials of the order 4 in the pion momentum to @xmath37 : @xmath38 in table  [ tablecoupl ] all expansion coefficients for the @xmath4 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 resonances are summarized .",
    "the resulting effective couplings for the @xmath41 transition are depicted in fig .",
    "[ s11coupl ] , as well as the fitted functions . as one readily notices , the energy - dependence is not too strong , the coefficients of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are indeed very small .",
    "but it is obvious , looking at the large error bars , that these fits contain a sizeable uncertainty .",
    "now we are ready to apply the bt model to @xmath5-photoproduction . to this end",
    "we have to make a choice for the parameters of the born terms .",
    "we have chosen a small value @xmath44 ( ps - coupling ) as also favoured in @xcite with the same cutoff factor as in ( [ fpi ] ) .",
    "for the vector meson couplings we have taken the same values as in @xcite .",
    "first we show in fig .",
    "[ e0p ] the @xmath45 multipole of pion photoproduction .",
    "the description is quite satisfactory , but not as good as in @xcite , which might be due to the fact that our ansatz for the e.m .",
    "vertices and couplings is not as flexible as the one in @xcite .    the predictions for the elementary @xmath5-production process",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ sigmadiffeta ] for the total and differential cross sections .",
    "one readily notices that the experimental data are described quite well , although not perfectly .",
    "we overestimate the maximum of the total cross section by @xmath46  5  % which we do not consider as serious for the present investigation",
    ". thus the satisfactory overall description is quite a success in view of the fact , that no additional fitting to @xmath5-photoproduction data has been applied . a similar successful description using the bt model including an e.m",
    ".  background has been reached by tiator et al .",
    "@xcite before . all in all",
    ", we have obtained a realistic description of the elementary process that is simple enough to be incorporated into the deuteron .",
    "however , we would like to mention , that the ratio @xmath47 extracted from the present model is @xmath46  0.2 , and even somewhat larger in the threshold region .",
    "the comparison of these couplings with the results of other approaches , like the effective lagrangian approach , is somehow difficult , because ours are complex , with sizeable imaginary parts , and energy - dependent . nonetheless , this ratio is about the same as was needed to fit the data on coherent @xmath5-production on the deuteron in the impulse approximation by hoffmann - rothe et al .",
    ". a smaller value of @xmath46  0.09 was extracted from the incoherent reaction by the same authors assuming a simple quasifree picture while in @xcite a value of @xmath46  0.11 was found .",
    "another remark is in order , namely the results for @xmath5-photoproduction presented above are still model dependent , because we found that the observables depend sizeably on the cutoff parameter of the pionic born background used in the bt fitting procedure .",
    "this is expected , because the channels @xmath13 and @xmath48 are of course not independent .",
    "they both would emerge from a consistent treatment of the e.m .",
    "interaction within a coupled channel model , although this connection is somehow indirect within the bt approach .",
    "however , the fact , that it is possible to choose the born background for the pionic reaction such that the @xmath5-process is described simultaneously , is in our opinion at least a consistency check of the bt model .",
    "we show in fig .  [ f1 ] the graphs of the coherent process which we have included in the present calculation .",
    "they comprise the one - body resonance ( @xmath49 $ ] ) , born ( @xmath50 $ ] ) , disconnected two - body terms ( @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] ) , various rescattering terms ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) and meson exchange current ( mec ) contributions ( @xmath57 $ ] , @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 $ ] ) . as resonances",
    "we have considered the three resonances most likely to affect @xmath5-photoproduction , i.e.  @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 .",
    "the various pieces of the elementary amplitude can be incorporated easily into the deuteron . for the energy dependence of the resonance couplings and the self energies , one has to specify the invariant mass @xmath60 of the @xmath61-subsystem as is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we have taken the spectator - on - shell approximation , because the reaction is dominated by small fermi momenta .",
    "it is well known that the first two resonances @xmath1 and @xmath2 have almost no effect on the differential cross section of the elementary reaction @xcite , although polarization observables may show a higher sensitivity to those resonances .",
    "for this reason we have considered @xmath62 rescattering only besides @xmath63 rescattering . in order to treat the exchange of intermediate @xmath11- and @xmath5-mesons we have solved a set of coupled equations for the @xmath63 and @xmath3 channels using the static bonn obepq(abc ) meson exchange potentials @xcite and",
    "static nucleon - resonance transition potentials including a box - renormalization @xcite of the @xmath63 interaction , @xmath64 with @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the meson momentum transferred onto the first nucleon ( or resonance ) , @xmath67 is the corresponding on - shell meson energy , @xmath68 in the case of the @xmath69 potential , and @xmath70 for the @xmath71 potential .    in order to fix the transition strength we have studied the isoscalar @xmath72-phase of @xmath63-scattering which is expected to be most sensitive to the incorporation of @xmath3 transition potentials , because the @xmath3 state couples to this partial @xmath63 wave as a s - wave .",
    "the static bonn obepq(abc ) potentials describe the real part of this phase quite well without this resonance and we find no large effect of the additional @xmath3 interaction , also in the isovector scattering phases . on the other hand ,",
    "the inelasticities can not be described satisfactorily by our model .",
    "this is probably a shortcoming of the present approach .",
    "a more consistent meson - theoretical description of @xmath63 scattering would start with a model incorporating all relevant resonances right from the beginning so that all resonance parameters could be fixed by a fit to @xmath63-scattering data .",
    "such a calculation is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "since we were unable to fix the strength of the @xmath62 and @xmath73 transition potentials by considering @xmath63 scattering , we have chosen the same couplings as for the elementary process given in @xcite , but use a pole - normalized cutoff of @xmath74 . with this choice",
    "we believe to maximize rescattering effects .",
    "turning now to the results of the coherent process on the deuteron we show in fig .",
    "[ sigmadiffetadeut ] the theoretical total cross section for coherent @xmath5-production on the deuteron . evidently , the reaction is dominated by the resonance contribution .",
    "the born terms give a small reduction at lower energies but lead to an enhancement near the maximum shifting it slightly to higher energies .",
    "rescattering effects yield a sizeable reduction , in particular very close to the threshold where they dominate .",
    "the additional mec contributions are small , they amount to @xmath46  3  % .",
    "furthermore , the first order rescattering , i.e. , the one - loop approximation @xmath75 is a reasonable approximation for the coherent reaction only close to threshold .",
    "it breaks down very soon for higher energies , leading to an enhancement above @xmath76 in contrast to the reduction of a complete coupled channel calculation .    as next",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ sigmatotetadeut ] the data of @xcite and the theoretical differential cross sections in the impulse approximation and with inclusion of rescattering and mec .",
    "the impulse approximation appears to be in quite good agreement with the data .",
    "it is dominated by the @xmath4 resonance , the born terms and vector meson graphs are small in accordance with the findings of @xcite , although single born terms , like the z - graphs or the @xmath77 meson exchange graph , are not negligible .",
    "inclusion of rescattering leads to a sizeable decrease , in particular in the backward direction , while mec contributions , not separately shown , are small , similar to what was found for the analogous reaction of @xmath78 production on the deuteron @xcite .",
    "also kamalov et al",
    ".  found a decrease by rescattering , but much smaller in size , which likely is due to their neglect of pion exchange .",
    "our findings are at variance with those of n.  hoshi et al .",
    "@xcite which were much larger in size and which lead to an increase of the cross section .",
    "especially , we find that the effect of @xmath5-exchange is strongly suppressed compared to pion exchange . in order to have the effect of @xmath5-rescattering to be of the same magnitude as @xmath11-rescattering",
    ", the @xmath79 coupling would have to be much bigger than the @xmath80 coupling strength .",
    "but the partial decay widths of @xmath81 and @xmath82 certainly rule out this scenario .    compared to the experimental data ,",
    "one notices a systematic underestimation of the complete calculation by about 30 to 40  % for energies below 750 mev while at 750 mev the agreement is quite satisfactory . on the other hand ,",
    "we had already remarked above that we consider the size of rescattering contributions as an upper limit , the reason for this being that we were unable to determine precisely the magnitude of the appropriate transition potentials , as was the case in @xcite for the corresponding reaction @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , in view of the fact that we found with our maximal choice of parameters a reduction of up to 50  % in the total cross section by rescattering , it is very likely that a more realistic choice of parameters would reduce the size of rescattering effects .",
    "in other words , the decrease of the cross section by rescattering might appear too strong .",
    "however , considering the quite large error bars it might be premature to draw a definite conclusion here as to whether a serious discrepancy between theory and experiment exists or not .    as a summary we would like to state that the most important contribution is the one - body part involving the @xmath4 resonance .",
    "thus the properties of this resonance , especially the parametrization of its self energy , govern the coherent reaction on the deuteron .",
    "the e.m .",
    "structure of the @xmath4 resonance used in this work gives a realistic description of the elementary process and thus should be reliable also for the coherent production on the deuteron .",
    "the sum of nucleonic born terms and vector meson contributions is small . among the medium effects ,",
    "the rescattering is sizeable and leads to a reduction of the differential cross section , while mec contributions are much smaller .",
    "the role of the latter might change in electroproduction with increasing momentum transfers .",
    "with respect to the question whether a discrepancy between coherent and incoherent production exists , as claimed in @xcite , a convincing test would be the incorporation of our effective couplings into a calculation of the incoherent process @xmath84 .",
    "this will be the topic of a forthcoming paper ."
