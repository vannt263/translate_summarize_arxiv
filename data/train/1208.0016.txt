    "in the view of the so - called agn unified model @xcite a super - massive black hole ( smbh ) harbored at the center of the agn powers the nuclear activity .",
    "the region where the activity takes place can be observed from different viewing angles . therefore depending on the orientation of the agn",
    "the observer s line of sight intercepts different amounts of the optically thick gas  dust structure ( torus ) that surrounds the smbh . the nuclear radiation at optical / uv and x - ray wavelengths is efficiently absorbed by the torus .",
    "the amount of obscuring matter ( n@xmath3 column density associated to the torus ) can be best inferred by x - ray spectra of the agns .",
    "x - ray surveys are therefore powerful tools for agn population studies .",
    "the bias of x - ray surveys strongly depends on the column density associated to the sources and the survey sensitivity : the larger the column density and the worse the flux sensitivity , the better the low  absorbed sources are selected .",
    "such selection effect is negligible for unabsorbed sources ( exhibiting n@xmath3 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 ) while it affects the absorbed sources ( exhibiting n@xmath3 @xmath7 10@xmath5 @xmath6 ) and it is magnified for sources with column densities n@xmath3 @xmath8 1.5 @xmath9 10@xmath10 @xmath6 .",
    "this latter value corresponds to the inverse of the thompson cross - section ( @xmath11 ) and the optical depth unity for compton scattering .",
    "absorbed sources affected by such high column densities are defined as `` compton - thick '' .",
    "this plays an important role in nowadays most sensitive agn x - ray surveys that are performed by _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ in the energy range @xmath00.5 - 10 kev @xcite . at these energies",
    "less than a mere 10% of the nuclear radiation is energetic enough to pierce through the absorbing compton - thick torus @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the efficiently absorbed optical / uv radiation heats the dust of the obscuring medium , that is expected to waste the absorbed radiation in form of ir emission .",
    "indeed , an ir  excess due to warm dust heated by obscured agns has been found @xcite .",
    "infrared power - law selected samples in _ chandra _ deep fields are promising agn ",
    "candidates @xcite .",
    "the drawback of the ir selection is that the majority of the detected sources are not agns .",
    "furthermore this approach seems to sample best the sources within redshift 13 @xcite .",
    "this is the same redshift range in which _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ are preferentially selecting most agns in their deep surveys @xcite .",
    "instead the redshift space at z @xmath4 0.4 is so far poorly explored despite extensive studies @xcite .",
    "the low - redshift ( z @xmath4 0.4 ) universe is best fathomed at hard x  ray energies ( @xmath7 15 kev ) . with the advent of the integral @xcite and the _ swift _ @xcite missions , the selection of local agns through their hard x",
    " ray ( @xmath715 kev ) emission has proven to be an extremely powerful technique over the last few years .",
    "integral and _ swift _ carry coded - mask telescopes on board , namely the imager on  board the integral satellite ( ibis : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the burst alert telescope ( bat : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) respectively .",
    "ibis has two detector layers .",
    "one of which is the integral soft gamma - ray imager ( isgri : * ? ? ?",
    "ibis / isgri and bat have two major advantages : 1 ) they have a huge field of view , hence allowing to sample an adequate number of agns at low - redshift 2 ) they operate at energies above 15 kev , hence allowing detecting the photons having enough penetrating power to pierce efficiently even through the compton - thick torus .",
    "a further and major advantage in sampling photons above 15 kev from agns comes from the emitting source itself .",
    "indeed , a broad continuum bump , so - called `` compton - reflection bump '' , peaking at energies between 20 - 30 kev is produced by reflection of the primary nuclear radiation on the inner side of the obscuring gas @xcite .",
    "this spectral component has been found to be dominant in nearby heavily obscured agns @xcite .",
    "the compton - reflection component also plays an important role in reproducing the shape and intensity of the cxb @xcite , that peaks at 30 kev ( for most recent measurements see : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "estimates based on observations with pds @xcite on board the _",
    "beppo_sax @xcite satellite predict that compton - thick agns should dominate over unobscured agns in the local universe @xcite .",
    "this makes ibis / isgri and bat well suited instruments for detecting obscured agns in the local universe .",
    "ibis / isgri and bat both represent a major improvement for the imaging of the sky above 15 kev .",
    "however coded - mask detectors suffer from heavy systematic effects ( errors ) preventing them from reaching their theoretical limiting sensitivity @xcite .",
    "furthermore by design they block @xmath050% of the incident photons causing an increase of the statistical noise .",
    "these are the reasons that make the detection of extragalactic sources , that are mostly faint , still challenging to undertake . here",
    "we describe an alternative approach which has been developed ad hoc to improve the sensitivity of extragalactic hard x",
    " ray surveys by using ibis / isgri and bat .    in this paper",
    "we show that _ swift_/bat and integral / ibis observations can be merged to obtain a more sensitive survey that is able to sample limiting fluxes of @xmath03.3 @xmath9 10@xmath12 erg @xmath6 s@xmath13 in the 18 - 55 kev energy range .",
    "we call this the _ six _ survey , that stands for _ swift_integral hard x - ray survey .",
    "the _ six _ survey extends over a wide sky area of 6200 deg@xmath1 and it is used to obtain a small and persistent sample of faint sources .",
    "this enables the construction of the number density ( log @xmath14log @xmath15 ) as well as developing the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) for agns .",
    "in addition we estimate the contribution of this sample of agns to the intensity of the unresolved fraction of the cxb . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the cosmological parameters of : h@xmath16 = 70 h@xmath17 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 , @xmath18 = 0.73 .",
    "ibis / isgri and bat are both coded  mask instruments .",
    "their performances are considered as a milestone for the sky imaging at hard x - ray energies .",
    "they pose themselves as excellent instruments for population studies of faint hard x - ray sources shedding continuously light on the properties of the local agn population @xcite .",
    "currently the two instruments show a difference in the extragalactic sky survey .",
    "this is mainly due to the different pointing strategies adopted for the satellites .",
    "_ swift _ is quasi - randomly pointing the sky , while integral performs targeted observations and long exposures on the galactic plane .",
    "the authors of the 4@xmath19 ibis / isgri catalog @xcite conclude that the non  detection of bat  detected sources by ibis / isgri is just due to the low exposure of those sources in the isgri detector .",
    "indeed , at comparable exposure time on the extragalactic sky the bat sample @xcite contains @xmath070% extra - galactic sources , the ibis / isgri sample contains @xmath035% @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : bat - isgri ] summarizes the in  flight performances of the two instruments . for ibis",
    "/ isgri the flux sensitivity in the 2040 kev energy range at 4.8@xmath20 is computed over 90% of the extragalactic sky @xcite .",

    "to capitalize on the advantages of selecting local agns at hard x - ray energies we have combined the observations of ibis / isgri and bat .",
    "this greatly enhances the exposure time improving the _ six _ sensitivity as @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , the systematic uncertainties are minimized because the systematic errors of both instruments are uncorrelated .",
    "this reduces the uncertainties by a covariance term leading to a limiting flux sensitivity of 3.3 @xmath9 10@xmath12 erg @xmath6 s@xmath13 in the 1855 kev energy range .",
    "+ bat contributes to the _ six _ survey with a very uniform exposure .",
    "the exposure of ibis / isgri is less uniform ( see figure  [ fig : skycov ] ) .",
    "this is explained by the different fovs of both coded  masks instruments and by the different pointing strategies that are adopted by the _ swift _ and the integral missions . integral performs a dithering that leads to a large exposure time at the center of the surveyed sky area as shown in figure  [ fig : isgri - nep - exp ] .",
    "the center of this sky area corresponds roughly to the value of the ordinate in figure  [ fig : skycov ] where the ibis / isgri sky coverage outperforms that of bat .",
    "ibis / isgri is therefore contributing to the _ six _ survey with its long exposures on limited sky areas .      from observations at soft x ",
    "rays we have inferred the @xmath27-value of 64 out of our 74 agns .",
    "the level of this incompleteness will change as some of these sources are followed up by _ chandra _ ( pi e. bottacini cxc ao-13 ) and xrt .",
    "the fraction of obscured agns as function of luminosity is consistent with a previous work @xcite .",
    "also the drop at low luminosities @xmath010@xmath28 erg s@xmath13 is reproduced in our work .",
    "the relation is represented by an anti  correlation shown in figure  [ fig : lum - nh ] revealing that the @xmath27 function is luminosity dependent .",
    "in contrast to the simple agn unified scheme @xcite , where agns have the same geometrical structure irrespective of luminosity and redshift , this result shows that the opening angle of the torus surrounding the smbh is larger for more luminous agns .",
    "therefore , high ",
    "luminosity agns must be able to clean out their environments .",
    "the physical process responsible for this could be the stronger radiation pressure from the smbh of the more luminous agns . in this scenario the circumnuclear environment is exposed to higher pressure that causes greater mass outflow .",
    "indeed , the existence of such mass outflows is supported by recent observations @xcite .",
    "if accompanied by sufficient mechanical energy transfer , these outflows can provide the coupling of the smbh and host galaxy co - evolution @xcite .",
    "however , it is ambitious to draw conclusions from the observational fact of the anti  correlation .",
    "how the covering factor of the torus relates to the luminosity depends on the interplay of the smbh gravity with the gas , radiation , and magnetic fields accompanied by wind outflows .",
    "the thermal pressure in the gas is able to explain the low - velocity outflow as x - ray warm absorbers @xcite . instead , the uv radiatively - driven wind shields itself from x - rays from the central engine @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a natural shielding is obtained in the magneto - centrifugal outflow scenario @xcite .",
    "finally , in hydrodynamical simulations @xcite high - density gas arises naturally that is able to efficiently absorb x - ray radiation .",
    "all these processes show promising results in numerical simulations .",
    "+ a possible dependence ( decrease ) of the fraction of absorbed agns as function of redshift is marginally detected in this work ( see figure  [ fig : lum - z ] ) . even though within a larger redshift ( z @xmath4 3 ) range , a similar relation is found by @xcite .",
    "instead a strong increase of the fraction of obscured agn within 0 @xmath4 z @xmath4 2 is found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this dependency on the distance at high redshift can be due to the higher gas content in high  redshift ( z @xmath0 1.5 ) galaxies @xcite . in the local universe",
    "our results show a mild decay of the fraction of obscured agns with redshift .",
    "+ the fit to our flux ",
    "number density function is consistent with the euclidean model .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous measurements by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we extend the result towards lower fluxes reaching a flux limit of a few 10@xmath12 @xmath6 s@xmath13 . as a result of the increase of the number density of sources ,",
    "the _ six _ source sample improves the number  density of sources contributing to the cxb by more than a factor @xmath0  2 compared to the fraction derived from the sample in @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the latter sample to the cxb is obtained by integrating the emission of the agn over the entire extragalactic sky of 30000 deg@xmath29 .",
    "even though in our work we survey @xmath01/5 of the extragalactic sky , our surveyed sky area is particularly suited because of absence of strong sources .",
    "we can estimate the number of seyfert  like agn in a deep nustar @xcite survey .",
    "nustar is a nasa mission operating at energies in the range 380 kev and scheduled to be launched in june 2012 .",
    "it is the first high energy x - ray mission using focusing optics .",
    "its relatively small fov ( @xmath0 13 @xmath9 13 arcmin squared ) allows surveying small areas compared to coded  mask detectors .",
    "if the luminosity function derived here does not evolve strongly in either normalization and/or slope the estimated number of agn per square degree at energies @xmath030 kev is @xmath0100 for a limiting flux of 10@xmath30 erg @xmath6 s@xmath13",
    ". this will be quite possible to be performed by nustar since it will have an angular resolution @xmath045 arc sec and source confusion will not be a problem .",
    "nustar will perform very sensitive and beam  like extragalactic surveys tiling not more than a few deg@xmath1 of sky area .",
    "detailed predictions @xcite show , that independent of nustar s survey strategy ( corner shift or half shift ) and the cxb models , agns will be sampled most efficiently at redshift z @xmath7 0.5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : z - lum ] displays the redshift - luminosity plane of seyfert - like agns sampled by bat ( gray circles in background from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ six _ ( solid circles in foreground ) , and nustar .",
    "nustar data are taken from predictions in @xcite and adapted to the energy range 1855 kev .    ]",
    "as the nustar survey fields narrow , the redshift distribution of agns is shifted to higher redshift .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : z - lum ] where squares are from a shallow survey , crosses from the cosmos survey ( 2 deg@xmath1 ) , and asterisks from the ecdf - s survey ( 0.25 deg@xmath1 ) assuming an exposure of 6.2 msec .",
    "nustar s surveys will not compete with the _ six _ survey , but rather they will be complementary .",
    "indeed , if applied to the whole sky the _ six _ survey will fill the redshift and luminosity gap between the current surveys of ibis / isgri and bat alone and the nustar surveys . the absorbed _ six _ sources at low redshift",
    "are easy follow up targets for nustar .",
    "+ our small sample used for the xlf does not permit detecting an evolution in either luminosity or redshift .",
    "therefore , our data are modeled best by a non - evolving xlf plotted in figure  [ fig : lum - function ] .",
    "+ we use the 199 bat - selected seyfert - like agns of @xcite and later used in @xcite as a control sample in order to evaluate whether the _ six _ sample differs in some properties . for both samples",
    "we have derived the redshift distribution excluding radio - loud agns and quasars .",
    "the result is plotted in figure  [ fig : redshift - distribution ] where the solid line refers to the _ six _ sample and the dashed line represents the sample of @xcite .",
    "both samples were split into the same bin size . about 57% of the bat sources",
    "are detected within z = 00.025 . in the same redshift bin",
    "the _ six _ survey samples less than 45% of its sources .    ]",
    "the _ six _ survey is more sensitive compared to the bat survey .",
    "therefore it samples the sources systematically at higher redshift .",
    "sources at higher redshift are also the most luminous ones .",
    "this is marginally reflected in the xlf ( see figure  [ fig : lum - function ] ) for luminosities above @xmath31 .",
    "the best - fit of the xlf adapted from the bat survey ( dashed line ) has a slightly steeper slope at high luminosities . for luminosities below @xmath32 a substantial contribution from the host galaxy to the total luminosity",
    "is expected . therefore , the data point at lowest luminosities in not properly modeled by the _",
    "six _ xlf .",
    "+ finally , we verify whether the control samples and the _ six _ sample are drawn from the same source population .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test applied to the two samples with respect to redshift and luminosity does not allow us to reject the null hypothesis that the two samples are obtained from the same source population .",
    "therefore , the _ six _ is sampling sources at higher redshift from the same source population that is sampled by bat alone .",
    "better statistics for the _ six _ xlf can rule out the high - end slope",
    ". this can be achieved by applying the survey to the whole sky .",
    "a new approach has been developed to survey the sky at hard x - ray energies ( 1855 kev energy band ) by combining the observations of _ swift_/bat and integral / ibis resulting in the _ six _ survey .",
    "first we have performed the independent surveys for both instruments .",
    "then we have resampled , cross - calibrated and merged them . as a result of combining the observations from two different telescopes ,",
    "statistical and systematic uncertainties caused by the high background level of their coded - mask detectors are minimized . in turn the _ six _",
    "survey is more sensitive , like a survey from a virtual new hard x - ray mission .",
    "+ we applied the survey method to 6200 deg@xmath1 of sky ( @xmath0 20% of the entire extragalactic sky ) sampling 113 sources that are : 74 seyfert - like agns , 12 blazars , 5 galaxies , 2 clusters of galaxies , 3 galactic sources , 3 previously detect x - ray sources , and 14 unidentified sources ( of which 7 are newly detected without any counterpart and 7 are of uncertain association ) .",

    "+ the fraction of absorbed agn decreases with increasing luminosities .",
    "although the redshift dependence is marginally significant , we find a mild decrease of the fraction of obscured agns with increasing redshift .",

    "<S> the super - massive black - holes in the centers of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are surrounded by obscuring matter that can block the nuclear radiation . depending on the amount of blocked radiation </S>",
    "<S> , the flux from the agn can be too faint to be detected by currently flying hard x - ray ( above 15 kev ) missions . at these energies </S>",
    "<S> only @xmath01% of the intensity of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) can be resolved into point - like sources that are agns . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we address the question of the undetected sources contributing to the cxb with a very sensitive and new hard x  ray survey : the _ six _ survey that is obtained with the new approach of combining the _ swift_/bat and integral / ibis x  ray observations . </S>",
    "<S> we merge the observations of both missions . </S>",
    "<S> this enhances the exposure time and reduces systematic uncertainties . as a result </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a new survey over a wide sky area of 6200 deg@xmath1 that is more sensitive than the surveys of _ swift_/bat or integral / ibis alone . </S>",
    "<S> our sample comprises 113 sources : 86 agns ( seyfert - like and blazars ) , 5 galaxies , 2 clusters of galaxies , 3 galactic sources , 3 previously detected unidentified x - ray sources , and 14 unidentified sources . </S>",
    "<S> the scientific outcome from the study of the sample has been properly addressed to study the evolution of agns at redshift below 0.4 . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find any evolution using the 1/v@xmath2 method . </S>",
    "<S> our sample of faint sources are suitable targets for the new generation hard x - ray telescopes with focusing techniques . </S>"
