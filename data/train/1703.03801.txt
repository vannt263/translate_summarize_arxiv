    "the study of physical or living self - propelled particles  active matter  has certainly become a booming field , notably involving biologists and physicists , often working together .",
    "physical examples of active matter include self - propelled janus colloids @xcite , vibrated granular matter @xcite , or self - propulsion mediated by hydrodynamical effects @xcite , whereas biological examples are obviously ubiquitous : bacteria , cells , and simply speaking , most animals . in both physical and biological contexts , active matter can organize into rich collective phases .",
    "for instance , fish schools can be observed in a disordered swarming phase , or ordered schooling and vortex / milling phases @xcite .    yet ,",
    "there are important difference between `` dumb '' and `` intelligent '' active matter ( see the appendix for a more formal definition and discussion ) . for the former class , which concerns most physical self - propelled particles , but also , in some context , living active matter , interactions with other particles or obstacles do not modify the intrinsic or `` desired '' velocity of the particles but exert forces whose effect _ adds up to its intrinsic velocity_. intelligent active matter , like fish , birds , or humans , can also interact through physical forces ( a human physically pushing an other one or bumping into a wall ) but mostly interact through `` social forces '' . for instance , a fish or a human wishing to avoid a physical obstacle or an other animal will _ modify its intrinsic velocity _ in order to never actually touch it .",
    "moreover , a physical force applied to an intelligent active particle , in addition to its direct impact , can elicit a response in the form of a change in its intrinsic velocity ( for instance , a human deciding to escape or resist an other human physically pushing her / him ) .",
    "social forces strongly break the newtonian law of action and reaction : a fish or a human avoiding a physical obstacle obviously does not exert a contrary force on the obstacle .",
    "in addition , even between two animals 1 and 2 , the force exerted by 1 on 2 is most often not the opposite of the force exerted by 2 on 1 , since social forces commonly depend on stimuli ( vision , hearing ... ) associated to an anisotropic perception : a human will most often react more to another human ahead than behind her / him .",
    "similarly , social forces between two fish or two humans will also depend on their relative velocities or orientations : the need to avoid an other animal will be in general greater when a collision is imminent than if it is unlikely , due to the velocity directions .",
    "hence , if the understanding of the social interactions that underlie the collective behavior of animal groups is a central question in ethology and behavioral ecology @xcite , it has also a clear conceptual interest for physicists , since social and physical forces play very different roles on the dynamics of an active matter particle ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "these social interactions play a key role in the ability of group members to coordinate their actions and collectively solve a wide range of problems , thus increasing their fitness @xcite . in the past few years",
    ", the development of new methods based on machine learning algorithms for automating tracking and behavior analyses of animals in groups has improved to unprecedented levels the precision of available data on social interactions @xcite .",
    "a wide variety of biological systems have been investigated using such methods , from swarms of insects @xcite to schools of fish @xcite , flocks of birds @xcite , groups of mice @xcite , herds of ungulates @xcite , groups of primates @xcite , and human crowds @xcite , bringing new insights on behavioral interactions and their consequences on collective behavior .",
    "the fine - scale analysis of individual - level interactions opens up new perspectives to develop quantitative and predictive models of collective behavior .",
    "one major challenge is to accurately identify the contributions and combination of each interaction involved at individual - level and then to validate with a model their role in the emergent properties at the collective level @xcite .",
    "several studies on fish schools have explored ways to infer individual - level interactions directly from experimental data . the force - map technique @xcite and the non - parametric inference technique @xcite have been used to estimate from experiments involving groups of two fish the effective turning and speeding forces experienced by an individual . in the force - map approach",
    ", the implicit assumption considers that fish are particles on which the presence of neighboring fish and physical obstacles exert `` forces '' .",
    "visualizing these effective forces that capture the coarse - grained regularities of actual interactions has been a first step to characterize the local individual - level interactions @xcite .",
    "however , none of these works incorporate nor characterize the intrinsic stochasticity of individual behavior and neither attempt to validate their findings by building trajectories from a model .",
    "on the other hand , only a few models have been developed to connect a detailed quantitative description of individual - level interactions with the emergent dynamics observed at a group level @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty to build such models comes from the entanglement of interactions between an individual and its physical and social environment . to overcome this problem , gautrais et al .",
    "@xcite have introduced an incremental approach that consists in first building from the experiments a model for the spontaneous motion of an isolated fish @xcite .",
    "this model is then used as a dynamical framework to include the effects of interactions of that fish with the physical environment and with a neighboring fish .",
    "the validation of the model is then based on the agreement of its predictions with experiments on several observables in different conditions and group sizes .    in the present work ,",
    "we use but improve and extend this approach to investigate the swimming behavior and interactions in the red nose fish _",
    "hemigrammus rhodostomus_. this species performs a burst - and - coast type of swimming that makes it possible to analyze a trajectory as a series of discrete behavioral decisions in time and space .",
    "this discreteness of trajectories is exploited to characterize the spontaneous motion of a fish , to identify the candidate stimuli ( _ e.g. _ the distance , the orientation and velocity of a neighboring fish , or the distance and orientation of the tank wall ) , and to measure their effects on the behavioral response of a fish .",
    "we assume rather general forms for the expected repulsive effect of the tank wall and for the repulsive / attractive and alignment interactions between two fish .",
    "these forms take into account the fish anisotropic perception of its physical and social environment and must satisfy some specific symmetry constraints which help us to differentiate these interactions and disentangle their relative contributions .",
    "the amount and precision of data accumulated in this work and this modeling approach allow us to reconstruct the actual functional form of the response functions of fish governing their heading changes as a function of the distance , orientation , and angular position relative to an obstacle or a neighbor .",
    "we show that the implementation of these interactions in a stochastic model of spontaneous burst - and - glide swimming quantitatively reproduces the motion and spatial distributions observed in experiments with a single fish and with two fish .",
    "_ hemigrammus rhodostomus _ fish have been monitored swimming alone and freely in shallow water in three different circular tanks of radius @xmath0 , 250 , 353 mm ( see supplementary information ( si ) for details ) .",
    "this species performs a burst - and - coast type of swimming characterized by sequences of sudden increase in speed followed by a mostly passive gliding period ( see si movie s1 ) .",
    "this allows the analysis of a trajectory as a series of discrete decisions in time .",
    "one can then identify the candidate stimuli ( _ e.g. _ the distance , the orientation and velocity of a neighboring fish , or the distance and orientation of an obstacle ) that have elicited a fish response and reconstruct the associated stimulus - response function .",
    "most changes in fish heading occur exactly at the onset of the acceleration phase .",
    "we label each of these increases as a `` kick '' .",

    "as already briefly mentioned , for a physical point particle interacting through a physical force like gravity , the angle change @xmath135 would be the projection of the radial force onto the angular acceleration ( normal to the velocity of angular direction @xmath86 relative to the vector between the two particles ) and would then exactly take the form @xmath136 . hence , eq .  ( [ dphiatt ] ) ( resp",
    "( [ phiwnew ] ) , for the wall interaction ) is the simplest generalization accounting for the fish anisotropic perception of its environment , while keeping a product form and still obeying the left / right symmetry condition of eq .",
    "( [ exsymint ] ) ( resp . of eq .",
    "( [ simw ] ) ) . in principle , @xmath137 should be written most generally as an expansion @xmath138 . however , as the number of terms of this expansion increases , we run the risk of overfitting the experimental data by the procedure detailed in the si .",
    "in addition , the leading term of this expansion would still capture the main behavioral effects of the interaction and should be very similar to the results of fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , while the weaker remaining terms would anyway be difficult to interpret .",
    "note that the same argument applies to the alignment interaction , when exploiting the analogy with the magnetic alignment force between two spins .",
    "( [ dphiali ] ) is the simplest generalization of the interaction @xmath139 obtained in this case , while preserving the left / righ symmetry and product form .",
    "considering the fact that no regularization or smoothing procedure was used in our data analysis ( see si ) , the quality ( low noise , especially for angular functions ) of the results presented in figs .",
    "[ figure3 ] and [ figure5 ] strongly suggests that the generalized product forms used here capture most of the features of the actual experimental angle change .",
    "characterizing the social interactions between individuals as well as their behavioral reactions to the physical environment is a crucial step in our understanding of complex collective dynamics observed in many group living species and their impact on individual fitness @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we have analyzed the behavioral responses of a fish to the presence in its neighborhood of an obstacle and to a conspecific fish .",
    "in particular , we used the discrete decisions ( kicks ) of _ h. rhodostomus _ to control its heading during burst - and - coast swimming as a proxy to measure and model individual - level interactions .",
    "the large amount of data accumulated allowed us to disentangle and quantify the effects of these interactions on fish behavior with a high level of accuracy .",
    "we have quantified the spontaneous swimming behavior of a fish and modeled it by a kick dynamics with gaussian distributed angle changes .",
    "we found that the interactions of fish with an obstacle and a neighboring fish result from the combination of four behavioral modes :    \\(1 ) wall avoidance , whose effect starts to be effective when the fish is less than 2bl from a wall ;    \\(2 ) short - range repulsion between fish , when inter - individual distance is less than 30 mm ( @xmath140bl ) ;    \\(3 ) attraction to the neighboring fish , which reaches a maximum value around 200 mm ( @xmath141 to 7bl ) in our experimental conditions ;    \\(4 ) alignment to the neighbor , which saturates around 100 mm ( @xmath142bl ) .",
    "in contrast to previous phenomenological models , these behavioral modes are not fixed to discrete and somewhat arbitrary zones of distances in which the neighboring fish are found @xcite . instead , there is a continuous combination of attraction and alignment as a function of the distance between fish .",
    "alignment dominates attraction up to @xmath143 mm ( @xmath144bl ) while attraction becomes dominant for larger distances .",
    "as distance increases even more , attraction must decrease as well .",
    "however , the limited size of the experimental tanks and the lack of sufficient data for large @xmath84 prevented us from measuring this effect , suggesting the long - range nature of the attraction interaction mediated by vision . note that a cluster of fish can elicit a higher level of attraction , proportional to the 3d solid angle of the fish group as seen by the focal fish , as suggested by models based on visual perception @xcite , and as captured by the power - law decay proposed in eq .",
    "( [ attraction ] ) . designing experiments to test and quantify the long - range nature of the attraction interaction between fish would be of clear interest .",
    "moreover , the behavioral responses are strongly modulated by the anisotropic perception of fish .",
    "the wall repulsion effect is maximum when the orientation of the fish with regards to the wall is close to 45@xmath4 and minimum when the fish is parallel to the wall .",
    "likewise , the maximum amplitude alignment occurs when a neighboring fish is located on the front left or right and vanishes as its position around the focal fish moves towards the back .    to quantify separately the effects of attraction and alignment , we exploited physical analogies and symmetry considerations to extract the interactions between a focal fish and the wall and with another fish .",
    "previous studies have shown that in the golden shiners @xcite and the mosquito fish @xcite , there was no clear evidence for an explicit matching of body orientation . in these species , the alignment between fish was supposed to results from a combination of attraction and repulsion .",
    "however , at least in the mosquito fish , it is likely that the strength of alignment could have been underestimated because the symmetry constraints on alignment and attraction were not taken into consideration . in the rummy - nose tetra",
    ", we find strong evidence for the existence of an explicit alignment .",
    "the characterization and the measurement of burst - and - coast swimming and individual interactions were then used to build and calibrate a model that quantitatively reproduces the dynamics of swimming of fish alone and in groups of two and the consequences of interactions on their spatial and angular distributions .",
    "the model shows that the wall avoidance behavior coupled with the burst - and - coast motion results in an unexpected concentration of fish trajectories close to the wall , as observed in our experiments .",
    "in fact , this phenomenon is well referenced experimentally for run - and - tumble swimming ( for instance , in sperm cells @xcite or bacteria @xcite ) .",
    "it can be explained theoretically and reproduced in simple models @xcite , as the effective discreteness of the trajectories separated in bursts or tumbles prevents the individuals from escaping the wall .",
    "our model also reproduces the alternation of temporary leaders and followers in groups of two fish , the behavior of the temporary leader being mostly governed by its interactions with the wall , while the temporary follower is mostly influenced by the behavior of the temporary leader .",
    "this validated model can serve as a basis for testing hypotheses on the combination of influence exerted by multiples neighbors on a focal fish in tanks of arbitrary shape .",
    "moreover , it would certainly be interesting to study theoretically the dynamics of many fish swimming without any boundary and according to the found interactions .",
    "the study of the phase diagram as a function of the strength of the attraction and alignment interactions ( and possibly their range ) should show the emergence of various collective phases ( schooling phase , vortex phase ... ) @xcite .",
    "finally , our method has proved successful in disentangling and fully characterizing the interactions that govern the behavior of pairs of animals when large amount of data are available .",
    "hence , it could be successfully applied to collective motion phenomena occurring in various biological systems at different scales of organization .",
