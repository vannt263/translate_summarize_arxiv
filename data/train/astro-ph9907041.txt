    "although cosmology has been one of the first areas of application of general relativity , in physical cosmology we encounter rarely general relativistic considerations .",
    "relativistic effects are commonly restricted to either areas of very high density , like black holes or neutron stars , or global cosmological effects , like global dynamics of frw models . in theoretical implementations of observational cosmology , such as theoretical interpretation of the two - degree field(2df) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)projects , the stromlo - apm red - shift survey @xcite and",
    "the las campanas red - shift survey @xcite one usually rely on basic newtonian dynamics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the correct theoretical interpretation of these surveys needs a through understanding of structure formation processes in the universe , mainly objects of scales greater than galaxies and at cosmological distances .",
    "it is obvious that at such scales one can not use the full formalism of general relativity to study the dynamics of structures and one has to rely on some approximation methods . in relativistic jargon",
    ", the newtonian limit means gravity in the vicinity of objects having small mass , or expressing it more exactly , where the ratio of the schwarzschild radius to object radius is a very small number @xcite .",
    "but one never discuss the relativistic effects on cosmological parameters in the intermediate scales where the relativistic effects due to the mass concentration is negligible .",
    "this is exactly the case in the theory of structure formation . for small density",
    "contrasts it is used to apply the newtonian dynamics to the linear theory of structure formation . but even if one tries to apply the linear theory of structure formation to evaluate the observational data , general relativistic effects due to the large extension of the objects or their distances come in .",
    "this is exactly the point which has been neglected in theoretical studies up to now and we are going to consider it . + the problem is to formulate an approximation method within general relativity for the cases where we have small density perturbation in a frw model for intermediate regions smaller than the hubble radius but large enough to be forced to consider light cone effects .",
    "specifically , we will calculate the relation between the density contrast and the peculiar velocity in clusters within the general relativity and compare it to the well known newtonian relations .",
    "the formalism developed here shed some light on the methodology of the calculation of different so - called light cone effects which has been published @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the relativistic calculation helps us to understand more systematically the complex role of different cosmological parameters which come in once . in section",
    "@xmath1 we review the basic hydrodynamical equations based on the newtonian gravity . in section @xmath2 a perturbation formalism for frw universes in harmonic gauge is given . using this approximation formalism , we obtain a relativistic relation between the density contrast and the peculiar velocity . in section",
    "@xmath3 we obtain relativistic derivation from density contrast .",
    "section @xmath4 is devoted to the power spectrum .",
    "the general relativistic @xmath5value is then calculated in section @xmath6 . and",
    "finally in section @xmath7 we summarize the main points of this study . + throughout the paper we choose the signature @xmath8 , and assume @xmath9 , except where indicated .",
    "basic hydrodynamical equations used to study the peculiar velocity of structures in the linear regime are the continuity and the poisson equation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the density contrast in the homogeneous and isotropic universe with the background density @xmath12 . the peculiar velocity is defined by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the velocity of cosmic fluid , @xmath15 is the hubble constant , and @xmath16 is the physical distance . within the newtonian gravitational theory , the following relation between the density contrast and the peculiar velocity",
    "is then derived by peebles @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the biasing factor defined by @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "eq.([vq ] ) can also be written as follows : @xmath21 note that in general @xmath22 depends also on @xmath23 .",
    "however it has been shown by lahav @xcite that the effect of @xmath23 is negligible .",
    "our aim is to study the peculiar velocity of a linear structures in frw space  time .",
    "the structure is assumed to be large enough to take part in the cosmological expansion , yet smaller than the present hubble radius , with a density contrast small enough to justify the use of the linear theory .",
    "this is in contrast to the familiar textbook approach which uses newtonian gravity for the linear regime in the scales less than the hubble radius . as a result of our general relativistic calculations",
    "we will distinguish between intermediate scales where relativistic effects in some reasonable approximations have to be taken into account and small scales where the newtonian approximation is valid within the observational accuracy .",
    "therefore , we perturb linearly a frw metric , or what is the same , we expand a general metric linearly around a frw space  time . + over the past decades , perturbation of frw space ",
    "times have been studied using different gauges like synchronous , poisson and restricted  gauge ( for review see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these gauges are , however , not suitable for our purposes .",
    "as we know from the comparison of the weak limit of general relativity to newtonian gravity , the harmonic gauge is the most suitable one playing the role of the lorentz gauge in electromagnetism as contrasted to the coulomb gauge .",
    "therefore , we try to formulate the corresponding gauge in the perturbed frw space  time .",
    "+ consider a small perturbation of frw metric in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the background frw metric , @xmath26 the stress tensor of the cosmic fluid , @xmath27 the metric perturbation , and @xmath28 energy momentum tensor of the structures .",
    "the structures we are considering are in a matter dominated universe .",
    "therefore , the only non - zero component of the energy momentum tensor in the comoving reference frame is @xmath29 .",
    "taking into account the general form of the energy  momentum tensor of a homogeneous perfect fluid : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the four - velocity of the perturbed cosmic fluid .",
    "we may write its perturbed component as follows : @xmath32 where we ignored higher order of perturbation .",
    "we introduce harmonic gauge in frw metric as follows : @xmath33 for the @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the expression ( [ har ] ) , harmonic gauge can be written in the frw as follows : @xmath36 we obtain the ( 00)component of the perturbed einstein equation @xmath37 , after some lengthly calculations , in the following form : @xmath38 substituting @xmath39 component of harmonic gauge expression ( [ nu0 ] ) into ( [ g00 ] ) , einstein equation obtain as follows : @xmath40 note that for @xmath41 , i. e. the minkowski space time , the familiar poison equation is recovered .",
    "now , for scales smaller than the hubble radius , i.e. @xmath42 , it is easily seen that all the terms in the left hand side of ( [ pos ] ) can be ignored relative to the first term .",
    "in fact , we have to compare the hubble time @xmath43 with the characteristic time of changes in the cluster , @xmath44 , which is less that @xmath45 .",
    "it is then obvious that the second , third and fourth term which are of the order of @xmath46 and fifth term is in the order of @xmath47 are ignorable relative to the first term which is of the order of @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , taking the definition of the gravitational potential of the perturbing field , @xmath49 , as @xmath50 , we obtain finally for the perturbed field equation : @xmath51 where spatial derivatives of @xmath49 are in the terms of the physical coordinates @xmath52 .",
    "we see that the dynamics of perturbing potential obeys the same equation as in the case of relativistic radiation , taking into account the difference between comoving and physical  length .",
    "we may write therefore the potential in the retarded form : @xmath53 now , the gravitational acceleration @xmath54 due to the above gravitational potential is given by : @xmath55d^3r'.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the background density in the frw universe is @xmath56 , and in the linear regime for the structure formation , we have @xmath57 .",
    "it is then easily seen that the ratio of second term in ( [ gg ] ) with respect to the first one is of the order of @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the second term may be ignored and we obtain finally @xmath59 one may therefore interpret the gravitational effect of such linear perturbations at intermediate scales as the newtonian one with two modifications : + i. all coordinate lengths should be understood as physical and therefore have to be multiplied by the cosmological scale factor @xmath60 .",
    "the time coordinate should be replaced by the retarded time which means taking into account the finite velocity of light or doing the calculations on the light cone .",
    "+ this justifies the recent modifications to the newtonian calculations of different cosmological parameters related to the structure formation which are coined with the term light cone effects , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . + the expression ( [ gg ] ) may also be written in the differential form . by taking the divergence of ( [ gg ] ) and ignoring terms of the order of @xmath61",
    ", we obtain : @xmath62 which is of the same form as the newtonian poisson equation except for the modifications discussed above .",
    "+ the corresponding continuity equation can be obtained through the bianchi identities .",
    "we therefore consider the conservation of energy - momentum tensor in the harmonic gauge . now , using ( [ t0][t2 ] ) , the zero component of the bianchi identities as the conservation of the energy - momentum , @xmath63 leads to @xmath64 the third and fourth terms are small relative to the first and second term .",
    "this can best be seen by rewriting expression ( [ delta ] ) in the fourier space : @xmath65 in the linear regime , the first term is proportional to @xmath66 . from expression ( [ peebles ] ) it is easily seen that the second term is of the same order of magnitude as the first one . to estimate the third term we note",
    "first that @xmath67 is essentially the potential energy obeying the newtonian relation @xmath68 taking the time derivative of the corresponding equation in fourier space we easily obtain : @xmath69 the two terms on the right hand side of this equation are of the order of @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the third term in eq.([delta ] ) is of the order of @xmath71 times the first or the second term and is therefore ignorable . + to estimate the forth term in ( [ delta ] ) we consider the @xmath72 component of the einstein equation by taking into account that @xmath73 : @xmath74 taking the fourier transformation of the above equation and using the expression ( [ peebles ] ) , we obtain : @xmath75 which is small relative to the first and second term and can be ignored . therefore ( [ delta ] ) may be written as : @xmath76 we have therefore seen that by perturbing the matter dominated frw universe in harmonic gauge the same newtonian hydrodynamic eqs .([1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) are obtained with the two modifications discussed above . combining the ( [ retard ] ) and ( [ u ] ) and using the fact that in the linear regime @xmath77 we obtain as follows : @xmath78 omitting @xmath79 from both sides and substituting @xmath80 from ( [ retard ] ) , we obtain for the peculiar velocity @xmath81 in the following sections we will rewrite the above relativistic expression in terms of observational parameters and will compare it to the corresponding newtonian results .",
    "assume a cluster of galaxies , @xmath82 , at a large distance from us .",
    "take two typical galaxies @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( fig.1 ) . for the purpose of calculating the relation between density contrast and peculiar velocity",
    "we need the gravitational action of @xmath84 on @xmath83 .",
    "the situation is best visualized in a space  time diagram .",
    "the world lines of @xmath83 and @xmath85 cross our past light - cone at the observation event @xmath86 at @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "these events correspond to our observation of the galaxies .",
    "but the action of @xmath84 on @xmath83 is defined through another event : crossing of the past light - cone of @xmath89 and the world - line of @xmath84 .",
    "call this event _ r _ ( fig.1 ) .",
    "times corresponding to each of the events @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are characterized by the corresponding subscripts .",
    "our observation time at the event @xmath86 is given by @xmath92 .",
    "now , we have to calculate the relation between @xmath93 and @xmath94 using observed data on @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "+ note first the following relations between time and space coordinates of the events @xmath87 and @xmath88 , taking again @xmath95 : @xmath96 let @xmath83 be the reference galaxy . the action of any other galaxy , like @xmath84 , on @xmath83 is along the past light - cone of events on the world line of @xmath83 .",
    "it is easily seen that the time @xmath84 acts on @xmath83 is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is defined as the space coordinate of the event @xmath99 . within the approximation",
    "we are interested in , one can replace @xmath98 by @xmath100 .",
    "therefore the above relation can be written as @xmath101 now , eq.([rel ] ) can be written in terms of space time coordinates at @xmath102 and @xmath99 : @xmath103 quantities depending on @xmath99 have to be reformulated as functions of space time coordinates of @xmath104 .",
    "this is done in two steps .",
    "first we expand @xmath105 in terms of @xmath106 and @xmath107 in the terms of @xmath108 : @xmath109 where we have used the frw equations @xmath110 substituting now the eqs.([h ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) into ( [ vv ] ) , we obtain : @xmath111 note that the range of integration is taken as large as desired .",
    "now , terms depending on the event @xmath99 have to be replaced by those depending on @xmath104 . denoting the relative velocity of @xmath84 with respect to us as @xmath112",
    ", we obtain @xmath113 where @xmath114 here @xmath115 is the peculiar velocity of us with respect to cmbr and @xmath93 is the peculiar velocity of @xmath84 . using the relations",
    "( [ tq ] ) and ( [ tr ] ) and ( [ v ] ) , the expression ( [ rr1 ] ) may be written in the form : @xmath116 for the large scales we are considering , the term proportional to @xmath117 can be neglected relative to @xmath118 .",
    "we may also use the following relation which is easily understood : @xmath119.\\ ] ] now , let us expand the density contrast @xmath120 around @xmath121 : @xmath122 assuming the density contrast to be proportional to the scale factor @xmath60 , it is seen that the time derivation of the density contrast is given by : @xmath123 substituting ( [ de ] ) into ( [ d3 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath124 substituting for @xmath125 and @xmath126 from eqs.([tq ] ) and ( [ tr ] ) , we obtain finally : @xmath127 we have still to write the measure of the integral in ( [ vv ] ) , @xmath128 , in terms of the observed volume @xmath129 : @xmath130 from eq.([rr ] ) , ignoring higher order terms , the jacobian is obtained to be : @xmath131 where @xmath132 it can easily be seen that , within the approximation we are considering , it is allowed to replace in the above relation the divergence of the velocity by the density contrast from expression ( [ peebles ] ) to obtain the final result : @xmath133 replacing now all terms corresponding to the point @xmath99 with those defined at the point @xmath104 , we obtain finally for the peculiar velocity @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 to simplify the results and to have an estimation of the corrections to the newtonian expressions , we take a closer look at different terms in ( [ g ] ) .",
    "let us first distinguish between @xmath137 , and @xmath138 on one side and @xmath139 on the other side .",
    "the latter terms are typically of the order of formers times the fraction of the peculiar velocity divided by the hubble velocity , being of the order of @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , the latter terms may be neglected .",
    "the term @xmath141 contains the factor @xmath142 which is vanishing in general . to see this ,",
    "consider a cluster around @xmath143 . because of the symmetric distribution of matter in the cluster the gradient term accept positive and negative values while @xmath143 is almost constant .",
    "therefore , one may assume that the integral in @xmath141 is vanishing .",
    "the same is true about the contribution of the term @xmath144 in @xmath145 .",
    "this is due to the large extent of our integration domain represented by @xmath143 .",
    "now , for stromlo  apm and las campanas  red - shift survey we may assume the distance to the cluster to be of the same order as the extent of the cluster , @xmath146 , so that we have @xmath147",
    ". a closer look at the remaining terms shows that @xmath148 are of the order of or bigger than @xmath149 .",
    "we may therefore write @xmath150 where @xmath151 substituting now @xmath152 in expression ( [ vvv ] ) we obtain finally : @xmath153 where @xmath146 is the size of structure and @xmath154 is explicitly inserted again . in the limit @xmath155 or @xmath156",
    "we obtain the newtonian value for the peculiar velocity , @xmath157 , which is just the first term on the right hand side of ( [ vvv ] ) .",
    "therefore , the relative relativistic correction to the peculiar velocity up to the first order of @xmath158 is given by @xmath159 where we have taken the absolute values for the velocities and added the subscripts @xmath160 and @xmath161 to emphasize the relativistic corrections . taking the divergence of the ( [ vvv ] ) , we obtain a relation between the density contrast and the divergence of the peculiar velocity : @xmath162 here again , in the limit @xmath155 the second term on the right hand side vanishes and we get the familiar newtonian expression for the density contrast , which will be denoted by @xmath163 .",
    "now , to distinguish the density contrast appearing on the right hand side of ( [ divv ] ) from the newtonian value , we call it @xmath164 .",
    "the expression ( [ divv ] ) is now written as : @xmath165 in the following sections we will calculate the density and velocity power spectra for both newtonian and relativistic cases .",
    "take the correlation function of density contrast as @xmath166 defined in a cosmological volume @xmath167 . for simplicity we will omit hereafter the subscript @xmath168 in @xmath169 .",
    "the power spectrum is given by the fourier transform of the correlation function : @xmath170 using relation ( [ drel ] ) between the newtonian and relativistic density contrast , substituting it in eq.([corr ] ) and ignoring higher order terms in @xmath171 , we obtain the following relation between the newtonian and relativistic  correlation functions : @xmath172 the divergence term on the right hand side is calculated in the appendix a and is given by @xmath173 using this relation and taking the fourier transform of expression ( [ corrn ] ) , the following relation between the newtonian and relativistic  power spectrum is easily obtained : @xmath174 in the limit @xmath155 , the newtonian value is regained .",
    "let us now calculate the relativistic velocity power spectrum . the peculiar velocity is now expressed in terms of its fourier components : @xmath175 where @xmath167 is the space volume .",
    "its power spectrum is defined as @xmath176 . if @xmath177 is an isotropic gaussian field , then the different fourier components are uncorrelated and the power spectrum provides a complete statistical description of the field .",
    "the velocity spectrum is given by @xmath178 as we have shown in the appendix b , the fourier transform of ( [ vrelat ] ) leads then to the following relation between the newtonian and relativistic velocity spectrum : @xmath179 the newtonian spectrum is independently obtained by taking the fourier transform of ( [ peebles ] ) : @xmath180 where @xmath181 .",
    "these relations are obtained in terms of real space expressions in contrast to power spectrum data which are obtained in the red - shift space @xcite .",
    "it is used to change the factor @xmath182 in front of the term on the right hand side of ( [ vn ] ) to @xmath183 to account for the transformation between red - shift- and real - space .",
    "therefore we may write the final equation in terms of red - shift data in the form @xmath184 where @xmath185 now , using expression ( [ mm ] ) the relativistic velocity spectrum will be given in the form @xmath186 where @xmath187",
    "any observation in cosmology is carried along the light cone and not on a space - like slice defined by a definite observer time .",
    "however the difference between the two procedures are usually ignorable , which leads to the usual ignorance of the light cone effects and the finite signal velocity . at cosmological distances",
    "this difference can leads however to observable effects .",
    "+ here we have calculated the peculiar velocity  density contrast relation in a cluster of galaxy taking into account the finite signal velocity .",
    "the result differs from the familiar newtonian relation through a lengthly term which can however be simplified for a typical cluster .",
    "the estimation based on this simplification depends on the extend of the cluster ; the larger the extent the bigger the difference .",
    "let us calculate the term @xmath188 appearing in ( [ drel ] ) and ( [ corrn ] ) . using eqs.([f1]-[f9 ] )",
    "we may write : @xmath189 the symmetric distribution of matter in large scales leads to positive and negative values for @xmath190 in the first integral which makes it vanishing .",
    "the second integral on the right hand side may be written as @xmath191 .",
    "the average value of density contrast , @xmath192 , taking the domain of integration sufficiently large , does vanish too .",
    "we then obtain finally : @xmath193      in order to derive the newtonian power spectrum we substitute expression ( [ nab ] ) into ( [ corrn ] ) : @xmath194 taking the fourier transformation of it we obtain @xmath195 putting for simplicity @xmath196 we may write @xmath197 , which leads to @xmath198 calculation of the velocity power spectrum is similar to above procedure .",
    "one start with ( [ vrelat ] ) , by substituting it into ( [ 73 ] ) and taking fourier transformation of it and using eq.([pows ] ) , it is easily seen that : @xmath199    99    tadros , h. , efstathiniou , g , _ mnras _ , * 282 * , 1381 ( 1996 ) .",
