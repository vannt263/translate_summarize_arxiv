    "cracks are observed on various materials such as rocks , tectonic plates , and paintings .",
    "these cracks are fascinating and has been studied by many researchers .",
    "the study of drying cracks in a powder - water mixture was also included in these researchers . in one example , it was noticed that when a layer of a powder - water mixture is dried in a container , it shrinks and cracks are formed on it @xcite .",
    "the cracks extend from the surface of the mixture to the bottom and propagate horizontally along a line . as a result",
    ", a two - dimensional fracture pattern is formed on the surface of the mixture .",
    "when we gently pour a powder - water mixture into a container and leave it undisturbed during the drying process , a random , isotropic fracture pattern is formed .",
    "however , nakahara and matsuo reported that when an external force is applied to the mixture before drying , the fracture pattern changes depending on the manner in which the force is applied @xcite .",
    "for example , when the mixture is vibrated in one direction before drying , cracks that are perpendicular to the direction of the vibration emerge first .",
    "finally , a lamellar fracture pattern is formed .",
    "it takes more than 3 days for the cracks to be formed after the vibration .",
    "it is quite surprising that the effect of applying the force remains for such a long time .",
    "the experimental result attained by nakahara and matsuo represents that a fracture pattern is controlled by the memory of an external force applied before drying .",
    "similar memory effects that a response can be controlled by the memory of an operation have been observed in other materials , such as sand piles @xcite , micro - gel pastes @xcite , and rubbers @xcite . by recalling that these memory effects have been studied from a rheological point of view , we conjecture that the rheological property of a mixture plays an important role in the memory effect on the formation of drying cracks .    among the rheological properties of the mixture , the most conspicuous one may be plasticity . hence , we study the role of plasticity in the memory effect on the formation of drying cracks .",
    "first , in sec . [ modelsec ] , we propose a model of the formation of drying cracks in a viscoplastic material . in sec .",
    "[ asec ] , we find that a viscoplastic material memorizes the effect of an external force before drying as a plastic deformation by calculating the model numerically . by the influence of this plastic deformation , when an external force is applied to the material , a crack perpendicular to the force emerges earlier than when no force is applied .",
    "based on this result , we conjecture that the perpendicular cracks emerge first by a plastic deformation .",
    "furthermore , we express the position of the first perpendicular crack in terms of measurable material properties in sec .",
    "[ zuresec ] .",
    "this result can be used to test our conjecture that the memory effect is caused by a plastic deformation .",
    "section [ sumsec ] is devoted to the summary and discussion .",
    "technical details are summarized in appendix [ sol ] .",
    "we propose the model of a viscoplastic material in a similar way as that demonstrated by ooshida and sekimoto @xcite .",
    "we consider a viscoplastic material of thickness @xmath0 and width @xmath1 in a container , as shown in fig .",
    "[ paste2 ] .",
    "the coordinate system @xmath2 is assumed such that the center of the container is at @xmath3 and the bottom is at @xmath4 . for the mathematical simplicity ,",
    "we restrict our attention to plane strain deformations of the viscoplastic material and we consider only a displacement @xmath5 in the @xmath6 direction and a plastic strain @xmath7 , which express the occurrence of a plastic deformation .",
    "we assume that the time evolutions of @xmath5 and @xmath7 are described as @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a coefficient of a viscosity , @xmath11 is an external force , @xmath12 is a yield stress , @xmath13 is a normal stress , @xmath14 is a shear stress and @xmath15 is a coefficient which determines the speed of the plastic strain . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are determined by constitutive equations : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are lame coefficients , and @xmath19 is a reference strain rate .",
    "an increase in the reference strain rate represents an effect of shrinking by drying @xcite .",
    "we consider the case where the functional forms of @xmath11 , @xmath20 , and @xmath19 are given as @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 represent the maximum value of an external force , the yield stress before drying , and the speed of drying , respectively .    in order to specify the model",
    "completely , we assume the boundary conditions . at the region where the material comes into contact with the container , the displacement",
    "is set to zero .",
    "in contrast , at the region where there is no contact between the material and the container , the stresses applied to the free surface become zero . here , one peculiar phenomenon arises : when the material is dried , it peels off from the walls of the container .",
    "this phenomenon implies that the boundary conditions change when the peeling occurs .",
    "hence , we assume boundary conditions @xmath27 for @xmath28 , and @xmath29 for @xmath30 , where we consider that the peeling occurs at @xmath31 . in table",
    "[ paratable ] , we summarize the functional forms of the parameters and the boundary conditions at the walls of the container when @xmath32 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we assume the condition of a crack formation . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the condition has not yet been completely understood ; however , two conditions have been used in previous works .",
    "these are the critical stress condition and the griffith criterion . under the critical stress condition ,",
    "a crack is formed when the stress exceeds a material constant .",
    "this has been used in several numerical models @xcite because of the technical advantage of the local condition .",
    "in contrast , under the griffith criterion , a crack is formed when the energy released during the formation of a crack exceeds the increase of the surface energy .",
    "this condition has been used by komatsu and sasa in their theory @xcite .",
    "although we can not determine which condition is more efficient , we employ the critical stress condition for the simplicity of the treatment .",
    "concretely , we define an average normal stress at the position @xmath6 as @xmath33 then , the condition of a crack formation is given as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the position of a crack , and @xmath36 is the time when the crack is formed .",
    "we only consider cracks that are perpendicular to the @xmath6 axis .",
    "to summarize , our model consists of eqs .",

    "in order to understand how a viscoplastic material memorizes the influence of an external force that is applied before drying , we numerically calculate eqs .",
    "( [ u ] ) and ( [ s ] ) with the control parameter @xmath24 . in this numerical calculation ,",
    "the initial conditions are given as @xmath37 , and the parameter values are set as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . in the following we report all quantities in reduced units , i.e. , length in units of @xmath0 , stress in units of @xmath17 , time in units of @xmath50 and other quantities in units of the combinations of these units .    when no external force is applied to the material before drying , ( that is , @xmath51 ) stresses become zero at @xmath52 ( just before starting drying process ) .",
    "even when an external force is applied to a material , provided @xmath24 is not so large that the shear stress exceeds the yield stress , the stresses remain zero at @xmath52 .",
    "however , when @xmath24 is sufficiently large , the stresses have a non - zero value at @xmath52 , by a plastic deformation .    as an example",
    ", we show the results in the case @xmath53 .",
    "when an external force @xmath11 increases in time from 0 , the material displaces to the direction of @xmath6 , as shown in fig .",

    "next , we investigate the influence of a plastic deformation on the formation of drying cracks by comparing the time evolutions of @xmath59 after starting the drying process ( @xmath60 ) in the cases @xmath51 and @xmath57 , which are illustrated in fig .",

    "as the material is dried , the average normal stress @xmath62 increases in a similar manner for both cases .",
