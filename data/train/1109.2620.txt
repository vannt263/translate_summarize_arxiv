    "the extended hubbard model with spin exchange interaction @xcite is a conceptually simple effective model for a  description of magnetically ordered insulators in narrow band systems .    in this report",
    "we will focus on the zero - bandwidth limit of the extended hubbard model with magnetic ising - like interactions , which has the following form : @xmath2 where @xmath0  is the on - site density interaction , @xmath1  is @xmath3-component of the intersite magnetic exchange interaction , restricts the summation to nearest neighbors .",
    "@xmath4 denotes the creation operator of an electron with spin @xmath5 at the site @xmath6 , , and .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath7 depending on the concentration of electrons is calculated from @xmath8 with and @xmath9 is the total number of lattice sites .    the hamiltonian ( [ row:1 ] ) can be considered as a  very simplified model for the family of a@xmath10m@xmath11x@xmath12 compounds ( where a is ga or al , m is one of the transition metals v or mo , and x is s , se , or te ) .",
    "these compounds exhibit very interesting ferromagnetic behavior which is a  mixture of itinerant and localized behavior  @xcite . however , the single - particle excitations play a dominant role in the magnetic behavior of these compounds .",
    "although the electrons are not itinerant in the system , there is a finite density of states at the fermi level , and therefore low energy charge excitations are possible  @xcite .",
    "this points that the magnetic properties result from this band of localized electrons .",
    "the model ( [ row:1 ] ) can be treated as an effective model of magnetically ordered insulators .",
    "the interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be treated as effective ones and be assumed to include all the possible contributions and renormalizations like those coming from the strong electron - phonon coupling or from the coupling between electrons and other electronic subsystems in solid or chemical complexes . in such a general case arbitrary values and signs of @xmath0 are important to consider .",
    "one should notice that ferromagnetic ( ) interactions are simply mapped onto the antiferromagnetic cases ( ) by redefining the spin direction on one sublattice in lattices decomposed into two interpenetrating sublattices .",
    "thus , we restrict ourselves to the case .    for the model ( [ row:1 ] )",
    "only the ground state phase diagram as a function of @xmath7  @xcite and special cases of half - filling ( )  @xcite have been investigated till now .",
    "some our preliminary results have been also presented in ref .  .",
    "we have performed extensive study of the phase diagrams of the model ( [ row:1 ] ) for arbitrary @xmath13 and @xmath7 @xcite . in the analysis",
    "we have adopted two complementary methods : ( i )  a  variational approach ( va ) , which treats the on - site interaction term ( @xmath0 ) exactly and the intersite interactions ( @xmath1 ) within the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) and ( ii )  monte carlo ( mc ) simulations for @xmath14 dimensional square ( sq ) lattice in the grand canonical ensemble . in this report",
    "we present some results concerning strong on - site repulsion limit .",
    "the ferromagnetic ( f ) phase is characterized by non - zero value of the magnetic order parameter ( magnetization ) defined as @xmath15 . in the nonordered ( no ) phase .",
    "the phase separation ( ps ) is a state in which two domains with different electron concentration exist ( coexistence of two homogeneous phases ) . in the model",
    "considered only one ps state ( ) can occur .    in the paper",
    "we have used the following convention . a  second ( first ) order transition is a  transition between homogeneous phases with a  ( dis-)continuous change of the order parameter at the transition temperature .",
    "a  transition between homogeneous phase and ps state is symbolically named as a  `` third order '' transition . during this transition a  size of one domain in the ps state decreases continuously to zero at the  transition temperature",
    "one should notice that the first order transition line on the diagrams for fixed @xmath7 splits into two `` third order '' lines and it is connected with occurrence of ps sates on the diagrams for fixed @xmath13 .",
    "we also introduce the following denotation : , where @xmath3 is the number of nearest neighbors .",
    "vs. @xmath16 for ( as labeled ) obtained within va . dotted and solid lines indicate first and second order boundaries , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 denotes a  tricritical point . ]",
    "obtained phase diagrams are symmetric with respect to half - filling ( , ) because of the particle - hole symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ row:1 ] ) , so the diagrams will be presented only in the range .",
    "in this subsection we discuss the results for strong on - site repulsion obtained within va .",
    "the dependencies of the transition temperature as a function of @xmath18 for and ( this is close to the limit ) are shown in fig.[rys : fig1 ] .",
    "the range of the f phase stability is reduced with decreasing @xmath19 . a tricritical point @xmath17 connected with a  change of the transition order",
    "is located at and its location does not dependent on @xmath19 in the limit considered .",
    "if the system is analyzed for fixed  @xmath13  @xcite , at sufficiently low temperatures the homogeneous phases are not states with the lowest free energy and the ps state can occur . on the phase diagrams ,",
    "there is a second order line at high temperatures , separating f and no phases .",
    "a  `` third order '' transition takes place at lower temperatures , leading to a ps of the f and no phases .",
    "the critical point for the phase separation ( @xmath17 ) lies on the second order line and it is located at and .",
    "phase diagrams for and are shown in fig .",

    "the system exhibits either a  sequence of transitions : ps@xmath21f@xmath21no ( for ) or a  single transition : ps@xmath21no ( for ) and f@xmath21no ( for ) .    vs.  @xmath13 for : ( a )   and",

    "the size of the lattice is relatively small , i.e. .",
    "the general properties of mc phase diagrams are similar to those obtained within va .",

    "[ rys : fig3 ] .",
    "the transitions in finite systems are not sharp ( the finite - size effect on the order parameter , i.e.  in the no phase is larger than zero near the transition ) and thus the precise location of boundaries between different phases are determined by the discontinuity of the magnetic susceptibility . a  tricritical point @xmath17 connected with a  change of the transition order",

    "the f and no phases are separated by a  second order line . at lower temperatures ( below ) the ps state occurs , which is separated from homogeneous phases ( i.e. f and no phases ) by `` third order '' boundaries .",
    "the tricritical point is placed at substantially higher electron concentrations ( ) in comparison to va results and ( as in va ) its location is independent of the on - site repulsion @xmath19 in the limit considered .",
    "we considered a  simple model of magnetically ordered insulators .",
    "we presented phase diagrams for strong on - site repulsion including a  tricritical behavior obtained by monte carlo simulations and compared them with va results .",
    "it was shown that mc results are qualitatively similar to those derived within the va .",
    "however , one should notice that the mc transition temperatures are significantly smaller than va ones .",
    "the transition can be second as well as first order . at sufficiently low temperatures , where the transition is discontinuous ( if @xmath16 is fixed ) , homogeneous phases do not exist ( if @xmath13 is fixed ) and the phase separated states have a lowest energy .",
    "let us stress that the knowledge of the zero - bandwidth limit can be used as starting point for a perturbation expansion in powers of the hopping and as an important test for various approximate approaches analyzing the corresponding finite bandwidth models .",
