    "pelupessy et al . ( 2000 ) formulated the wind momentum equation for sectorial line driven winds including the finite disk correction factor for an oblate rotating star with gravity darkening for both the continuum and the lines .",
    "they calculated models with line  force parameters around the bi  stability jump at 25000 k. in this case , from the pole to the equator , the mass flux increases and the terminal velocity decreases .",
    "their results showed a wind density contrast @xmath1 ( hereafter @xmath2 ) of about a factor 10 independent of the rotation rate of the star .    in this work",
    ", we implement an approximative version for the oblate finite  disk correction factor , @xmath3 , allowing us to solve numerically the non linear m  cak momentum .",
    "we solve then this equation for a _ classical be _ star , for polar and equatorial directions . in this study",
    "we do not take into account the bi  stability jump .",
    "in order to incorporate the oblate distortion of the shape of the star due to the stellar rotation to the m  cak hydrodynamic model , we implement an approximative function . in view of the behaviour of @xmath3 and @xmath0 we approximate its ratio @xmath4 via a sixth order polynomial interpolation in the inverse radial variable @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 . in this form",
    ", we assure that the topology found by cur ( 2004 ) is maintained by the @xmath0 term , but it is modified by the incorporation of the @xmath7 polynomial . with this approximation we can solve numerically the non  linear m  cak differential equation .",
    "we solve the oblate m ",
    "cak equations for a classical be star with the following stellar parameters : @xmath8 k , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ( slettebak et al . 1980 ) and line  force parameter @xmath11 . for the other parameters , we have used two different values for @xmath12 , namely : @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and three values for @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 . in this study , we have considered _ the same value of @xmath15 , @xmath17 and @xmath12 _ for the pole and equator , i.e. without taking into account the bi  stability jump .",
    "we show only solutions for @xmath18 at the equator and pole . for the cases where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the density contrasts exceed a factor 100 , values which are in agreement with observations ( lamers & waters 1987 ) .     for equator",

    "the oblate correction factor has been implemented in an approximative form .",
    "the factor @xmath21 in the oblate correction factor certainly modifies the topology of the hydrodynamical differential equation and we suspect from first calculations that other critical points may exists and , therefore , more solutions might be present .",
    "we recover the observed density contrast only when the rotational velocity of the star is near the break - up velocity , confirming other theoretical works ( see e.g. , townsend et al , 2004 ) .",
    "the use of a set of self  consistent line force parameters is necessary to understand the wind dynamics of these rapid rotators .",
    "the full version of the oblate correction factor will be implemented to study the topology of the wind ."
