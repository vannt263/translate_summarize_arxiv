    "brown dwarfs ( bds ) are very low - mass objects that do not stabilize on the hydrogen - burning main sequence because they develope degenerate cores .",
    "they are akin to giant planets in that their luminosity and temperature drop continuously with time , and ultimately they become extremely cool and faint . the borderline between stars and bds",
    "has been known for 40 years to be at about 0.08  solar mass ( m@xmath5 ) for solar metallicity ( hayashi & nakano 1963 ; kumar 1963 ) .",
    "recent calculations yield a substellar limit at 0.072  m@xmath5 ( e.g. baraffe et al . 1998 ) .    for many years",
    "bds eluded firm detection , but since 1995 ( nakajima et al .",
    "1995 ; rebolo , zapatero osorio , & martn 1995 ) there has been a pletora of discoveries .",
    "the evidence for bds is based on observations of lithium , luminosity and surface temperatures of faint dwarfs , as well as astrometric and radial velocities of main sequence stars .",
    "dynamical measurements of bd masses are becoming available with the study of nearby binaries where both components are substellar ( martn et al .",
    "2000b ; lane et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "recent censuses of bds in young open clusters indicate that they are numerous ( bjar et al . 2001 ; moraux et al . 2003 ) .",
    "with increasing age , bds cool down and reach very faint luminosities , becoming indeed very difficult to detect .",
    "young stellar associations and open clusters have provided a gold mine for bd searches because these objects are still in the early phase of gravitational contraction .",
    "hence , they are brighter and warmer than older bds .    several processes of bd formation have been studied in some detail in the last few years .",
    "they can be divided in two main groups : ( 1 ) failed star - formation model : bds are ejected from unstable multiple systems during the collapse and fragmentation of a turbulent molecular cloud ( reipurth & clarke 2001 , 2003 ; sterzik & durisen 2003 ) ; ( 2 ) small star - formation model : bds result from the collapse of small cores of substellar mass in supersonically turbulent molecular clouds ( padoan & nordlung 2002 ) .",
    "these processes lead to different outcomes in the overall properties of a brown dwarf population which result in observable effects .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations show that the failed star - formation model produces a very low frequency ( @xmath65% ) of bd binaries , which must be limited to systems closer than 10  au ( bate et al . 2002 ; durisen , sterzik & pickett 2001 ; delgado - donate & clarke 2003 ) .",
    "the consequences of the small star - formation model for the properties of the bd binary population have not been explored , but it is reasonable to expect a higher frequency of binaries than in the previous scenario .    using the high - resolution capability of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , keck , and adaptive optics ( ao ) on large ground - based telescopes , the first very low - mass binaries have been resolved ( martn et al .",

    "most of the work has concentrated on nearby field ultracool dwarfs .",
    "however , the field targets represent a mix of ages , distances , primary masses and metallicities .",

    "each bdc was centered in the pc1 chip of the wide - field planetary camera  2 ( wfpc2 ) . with a plate - scale of 0@xmath1.0455 per pixel ,",
    "the pc1 has a field of view of 36@xmath1 in diameter . assuming a distance of 125 pc for the pleiades , this provides a physical separation of 2250  au from each bdc to search for companions .",

    "( 1999 ) which are systematically brighter .",
    "jameson et al . ( 2002 ) noted that the zapatero osorio et al.s @xmath9-band data lies on the harris system , and they provide a conversion to the cousins system .",
    "our f814w data is a good approximation to the @xmath9-band cousins system .",
    "we estimate that the 5  @xmath10 limiting magnitude for the survey is approximately i@xmath1122.5 and was constrained by the lower throughput and shorter exposure times of the f785lp images .",
    "all images have been inspected visually to search for obviously resolved companions .",

    "we used * a custom - made * psf fitting program to compute the precise separation , position angle and flux ratio of each candidate binary system .",
    "this program is identical to that used by bouy et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and it is fully described in that paper . a brief summary is given here for compleness : the psf fitting routine builds a model psf using 8 different psf stars in each filter coming from different wfpc2 images . a cross correlation between the model and the binary system yields the best values for five free parameters ( flux ratio and the pixel coordinates of the two components of the binary system ) . by using non - linear psf fitting",
    "we were able to push the limit of detection down to @xmath14 0@xmath1.060 arcsec for non - equal luminosity systems .",
    "figure  2 displays one example of the psf fitting technique . the uncertainties and limitations of this technique",
    "are discussed in bouy et al .",
    "the final best solutions for the binary parameters are summarized in table  2 .",
    "we report the detection of h@xmath2 in emission ( equivalent width = 13.1 @xmath150.2 @xmath16 ) , and lii resonance line in absorption ( equivalent width = 0.55 @xmath150.10 @xmath16 ) in the esi spectrum of ipmbd  25 ( shown in figure  3 ) .",
    "the lithium depletion boundary ( lpd ) in the pleiades is located at @xmath9=17.8@xmath150.1 ( stauffer et al .",
    "cluster members fainter than the lpd are expected to have preserved a measurable amount of lithium in their photosphere .",
    "cluster members brighter than the lpd are expected to have depleted their lithium abundances to a level that can not be detected .",
    "the apparent @xmath9 magnitude of ipmbd  25 is 17.67 ( hambly et al . 1999 ) , which is brighter than the lithium boundary .",
    "however , the apparent magnitude of the primary is @xmath9=17.93@xmath150.09 , which is fainter than the boundary .",
    "thus , our lithium detection confirms the membership of ipmbd  25 in the cluster , and is consistent with the previously established lpd .",
    "the lii equivalent width that we measured in our esi spectrum of ipmbd  25 is very similar to stauffer et al.s measurement for cfht - pl-11 .",

    "ipmbd  29 was found by hambly et al .",
    "( 1999 ) because it is a binary .",
    "thus , we must exclude it from our binary frequency statistics .",
    "our sample of _ bona fide _ cluster members includes 13 objects , which include 2 resolved binaries .",
    "thus , we derive a binary frequency ( defined as number of binaries divided by total number of objects in the sample ) of 15.3@xmath3% for our proper motion selected subset . statistical uncertainties ( 1  @xmath10 ) throughout this paper were calculating using poisson statistics for a small sample in the manner discussed by burgasser et al .",

    "we note that the two primaries of our binaries have @xmath9 brighter than 18.5 .",
    "we define magnitude limited bins of proper motion members as follows : ( 1 ) between @xmath9 = 17.7418.50 we have 9 objects and 2 binaries ; ( 2 ) between @xmath9 = 18.5021.00 we have 4 objects and 0 binaries .",
    "we also note that 4 of the 10 pleiades bdcs without proper motion data lie in the second magnitude bin . the rate of success in confirming bds among the bdcs found in the cfht survey ( bouvier et al .",
    "1998 ) in the magnitude bin of subset ( 2 ) has been 55% ( 6 proper motion members out of 11 candidates , moraux et al .",
    "if the success rate is similar for the npl and roque surveys , we expect 2 of the 4 bdcs to be confirmed .",
    "thus , we add 2 objects to the sample in bin ( 2 ) and we get 0 binaries for 6 objects .    to summarize , we get the following binary frequencies for the separation range 7 - 12  au : f@xmath17 = 2/13 = 15@xmath3% for the sample of proper motion members in the magnitude range @xmath9 = 17.7420.05 ; f@xmath17 = 2/9 = 22@xmath18% in the magnitude bin @xmath9 = 17.7418.50 for proper motion members ; and f@xmath17 = 0/6 implying f@xmath19 23% in the magnitude bin @xmath9 = 18.5021.00 for targets with confirmed proper motion membership ( 4 objects ) plus targets without proper motion information ( 2 out of 4 objects ) .",
    "our survey is not sensitive to separations smaller than 7  au in the pleiades and smaller than 10.5  au in @xmath0per .",

    "their primary masses are plotted in figure  5 with respect to their projected semimajor axis .",
    "there is a strong trend for the upper envelope of maximum separations to decrease with primary mass .",
    "a similar effect has been noted among binaries in the field ( burgasser et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the lack of bd binaries in the @xmath0per and pleiades open clusters , and in the solar vicinity , with separations larger than 15  au , may be a natural continuation of this effect , already present in stellar binaries , toward substellar masses . in order to check",
    "if there is any sudden change in the distribution of semimajor axis across the substellar boundary , a survey for binaries among m - type pleiades members is needed .",
    "in section 4.1 we obtained a binary frequency for the semimajor axis range 712  au of f@xmath17 = 22@xmath18% in the magnitude bin @xmath9 = 17.7418.50 , which corresponds to primary masses in the range 0.072  0.05  m@xmath5 according to the nextgen models for an age of 120  myr .",
    "we also derived a binary frequency for the same range of semimajor axis of f@xmath19 23 % in the magnitude bin @xmath9 = 18.5021.00 , corresponding to primary masses between 0.050  m@xmath5 and 0.030  m@xmath5 according to the dusty models for an age of 120  myr .",
    "the difference between these two mass bins is not statistically significant , but it suggests that lower mass bd binaries may be tighter than the resolution limit of our wfpc2 survey .",
    "the trend seen in figure  5 may continue into the substellar domain . a larger sample of binaries is needed to improve the statistics .",
    "figure  6 displays the mass ratios of resolved binaries in the pleiades cluster , including the 3 bd binaries found in this survey .",
    "we note the lack of mass ratios equal to unity among the bd binaries .",
    "this may be an effect of low number statistics .",
    "we also note that there are no bd binaries with q@xmath60.7 .",
    "the sensitivity of our survey is @xmath9 = 22.5 , which translates into a mass of 0.027  m@xmath5 using the dusty models for an age of 120  myr .",
    "thus , we are sensitive to mass ratios q@xmath130.37 for our most massive primaries ( mp@xmath140.07  m@xmath5 ) , and larger q for lower mass primaries . however , all our bd binaries were found at close separations where the sensitivity limit is only about 3 magnitudes ( bouy et al .",
    "the lack of bd binaries in our survey with mass ratios in the range q=0.70.4 may be an observational effect . since our survey is not as sensitive to low mass ratios as other surveys ( e.g. , bouvier et al .",
    "1997 ) , our bd binary frequencies may be underestimated if there is a significant number of bd binaries with mass ratios q@xmath60.7 which we have missed .",
    "nevertheless , we note that high - resolution surveys of nearby ultracool dwarfs have also failed to find binaries with q@xmath60.7 in larger samples ( bouy et al .",
    "2003 ; close et al . 2003 ; gizis et al . 2003 ) .",
    "so , there could be a real trend for vlm binaries to have mass ratios larger than q=0.7 .    in figure  7",
    "we plot the frequency of binaries wider than 7  au as a function of primary mass in the pleiades cluster .",
    "the binary frequency for brown dwarfs does not appear to be lower than for stars , although the error bars are still high due to low number statistics .",
    "in a survey carried out with hst / wfpc2 , we have found 4 binaries in a sample of 25 candidate vlm members in the pleiades cluster and no binaries in a sample of 8 candidate vlm members in the @xmath0persei cluster .",
    "we argue that 3 of the pleiades binaries are cluster members and one is not on the basis of the available proper motion and spectroscopic information .",
    "component masses and orbital periods are estimated from theoretical evolutionary models .",
    "follow - up observations will yield orbital parameters in a timescale of about a decade , and will provide powerful tests to the theory of substellar - mass objects .",
    "no binaries are detected with separations larger than 12  au among the vlm population of the @xmath0persei and pleiades clusters .",
    "we estimate a frequency of @xmath69% for vlm binaries with separations larger than 12  au in these clusters .",
    "this result agrees with the scarcity of vlm binaries wider than 15 au in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath62% , bouy et al . 2003 ; close et al . 2003 ; gizis et al .",
    "we show that in the pleiades there is a decrease in the upper envelope of binary separations with decreasing primary mass .",
    "the vlm binaries may be a natural continuation of this effect .",
    "we note that there is a significant lack of data of binaries for masses in the range 0.3 - 0.1  m@xmath5 in the pleiades . a study of binarity in those stars is needed to fill the gap between the cool stars and the vlm objects .",
    "we find that the binary frequency among pleiades bds with confirmed proper motion membership in the mass range 0.072  0.030  m@xmath5 and separations larger than 7  au is 15% .",
    "it is similar to that the binary fraction of stellar binaries for the same separation range .",
    "we divide our pleiades sample in two mass bins .",
    "we estimate a binary frequency of 22@xmath18% for primary masses in the range 0.072  0.050  m@xmath5 . for primary masses",
    "between 0.050  m@xmath5 and 0.030  m@xmath5 we derive an upper limit of @xmath623% .",
    "although our study is hampered by low number statistics , we suggest that low mass bd binaries may be systematically tighter than high - mass bds , and thus are not detected in our hst survey .",
    "studies of larger samples of bds are needed to test our suggestion .",
    "the bd binary frequency appears to be larger than 10% in the pleiades cluster and in the solar neighborhood .",
    "such a relatively high binary frequency does not support hydrodynamical models of bd formation that predict a very low ( @xmath65% ) bd binary frequency ( bate et al .",
    "2002 ) . within the error bars",
    ", our results may be consistent with dynamical decay models of evolution in open clusters with random pairing ( sterzik & durisen 2003 ) .",
    "however , such models predict a flat mass ratio distribution which does not seem to agree with the observed lack of vlm binaries with q@xmath60.7 . models of bd formation should take into account the fundamental observational constrains that bd binaries are numerous , and that they are biased toward separations smaller than 15  au and that the mass ratios tend to be larger than 0.7 .",
    "interferometric imaging and radial velocity studies of the pleiades vlm population are needed to discover short period binaries such as ppl  15 ( basri & martn 1999 ) and determine their frequency and mass ratio distribution .",

    "<S> we present the results of a high - resolution imaging survey for brown dwarf binaries in two open clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the observations were carried out with the wide field planetary camera  2 onboard the hubble space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> our sample consists of 8 brown dwarf candidates in @xmath0persei and 25 brown dwarf candidates in the pleiades . </S>",
    "<S> we have resolved 4 binaries in the pleiades with separations in the range 0@xmath1.0940@xmath1.058 , corresponding to projected separations between 11.7  au and 7.2  au . </S>",
    "<S> no binaries were found among the @xmath0persei targets . </S>",
    "<S> three of the binaries have proper motions consistent with cluster membership in the pleiades cluster , and for one of them we report the detection of h@xmath2 in emission and lii absorption obtained from keck  ii / esi spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> one of the binaries does not have a proper motion consistent with pleiades membership . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that brown dwarf binaries wider than 12  au are less frequent than 9% in the @xmath0persei and pleiades clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with an extension to substellar masses of a trend observed among stellar binaries : the maximum semimajor axis of binary systems decreases with decreasing primary mass . </S>",
    "<S> we find a binary frequency of 2 binaries over 13 brown dwarfs with confirmed proper motion membership in the pleiades , corresponding to a binary fraction of 15@xmath3% . </S>",
    "<S> these binaries are limited to the separation range 7 - 12  au and their mass ratios are larger than 0.7 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed properties of pleiades brown dwarf binaries appear to be similar to their older counterparts in the solar neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively high binary frequency ( @xmath4 10% ) , the bias to separations smaller than about 15 au and the trend to high mass ratios ( q@xmath40.7 ) are fundamental properties of brown dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> current theories of brown dwarf formation do not appear to provide a good description of all these properties . </S>"
