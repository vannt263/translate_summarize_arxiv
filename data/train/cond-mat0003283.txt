    "random resistor - diode networks ( rdn ) were introduced by redner  @xcite . nevertheless , they were already contained implicitly in the pioneering work of broadbent and hammersley  @xcite on percolation .",
    "rdn define a percolation model ( for a recent introduction to percolation see stauffer and aharony  @xcite ) on a @xmath5-dimensional hypercubic lattice in which nearest - neighbor sites are connected by a resistor , a positive diode ( conducting only in a preferred direction ) , a negativ diode ( conducting only opposite to the preferred direction ) , or an insulator with respective probabilities @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . in the three dimensional phase diagram ( pictured as a tetrahedron spanned by the four probabilities ) one finds a nonpercolating and three percolating phases .",
    "the percolating phases are isotropic , positively directed , or negatively directed . between the phases there are surfaces of continuous transitions .",
    "all four phases meet along a multicritical line , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 . on the entire multicritical line ,",
    "i.e. , independently of @xmath12 , one finds the scaling properties of usual isotropic percolation ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "about 20 years ago redner  @xcite studied the phase diagram sketched in fig .  1 as well as geometrical properties of rdn in two dimensions .",
    "he used real - space renormalization methods and planar lattice duality  @xcite .",
    "recently inui _ et al_.  @xcite have measured the order parameter exponent @xmath14 for the special case of a two - dimensional random diode network ( with @xmath15 ) by monte carlo methods combined with series expansions . at the symmetric critical point",
    "@xmath16 ( so called random manhattan ( rm ) ) , they found @xmath17 , which does not coincide with the known values wether for isotropic percolation ( ip ) , @xmath18 , nor directed percolation ( dp ) , @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , they concluded that the percolation properties of the random diode network constitute a new universality class different from isotropic and directed percolation .",
    "in this paper we study rdn by the methods of renormalized field theory .",
    "contrary to inui _",
    "et al_.  we find that random diode networks at the percolation point as well as rdn at the full multicritical line belong to the universality class of isotropic percolation .",
    "the variable @xmath20 , which maps out the multicritical line @xmath11 , is a redundant variable in the sense of the classification scheme of scaling variables by wegner @xcite .",
    "thus , all the points of this line are equivalent to the usual isotropic percolation point with @xmath13 .",
    "the case @xmath21 , in which positive and negative diodes are distributed with equal probability , leads to a breaking of isotropy and to elongated percolating clusters .",
    "however , this symmetry breaking can be easily compensated in the mesoscopic field theoretic formulation by a simple rescaling of the length scale of the preferred direction .",
    "the specific length scale is therefore redundant .",
    "wegner showed that the renormalization flow of a redundant variable depends on the particular form of renormalization group used and does not affect the physics .",
    "thus , in the case of redner s real space renormalization group , a special fixed point , the so called mixed one , is distinguished .",
    "the situation is different for a symmetry breaking which favors not only an axis but also a direction on that axis .",
    "this leads to a relevant variable @xmath22 and therefore to a new correlation length exponent @xmath23 .",
    "the crossover exponent @xmath24 describes the beginning of the crossover to directed percolation .",
    "it also relates the order parameter exponents , @xmath25 . in two dimensions , it has , according to the results of inui _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , the value @xmath26  .",
    "our perturbation calculation yields @xmath27 in agreement with the simulations .",
    "it should be noted that the interpretation of the multicritical line as a line of equivalent fixed points with the same scaling behavior , as well as the new correlation exponent @xmath28 , can be already found implicitly and explicitly in the early papers of redner @xcite ( his notation is @xmath29 for the new exponent @xmath28 ) .",
    "the organization of the remainder of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first develop a mesoscopic field theoretic model that is capable to describe the crossover from isotropic to directed percolation , which is the basic feature of rdn .",
    "we describe the renormalization of the model and calculate the renormalization factors to two - loop order . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce the renormalization group equation for the model and derive the general asymptotic scaling properties . in sec .",
    "iv , we derive an interpolating formula for the crossover exponent from the two - loop @xmath30-expansion and show that it reproduces the result of inui _",
    "et al_. in sec .",
    "v we reconsider the theory by frey , tuber , and schwabl  @xcite for the crossover from isotropic to directed percolation and clear up some minor shortcomings . in sec .",
    "vi , we give some conclusions and summarize our work . in an appendix ,",
    "we present the two - loop calculation of the renormalization factors .",
    "here we develop a mesoscopic model that is capable to describe the crossover from isotropic to directed percolation . in this paper",
    "we are only interested in connectivity properties of the percolating system .",
    "in contrast to earlier work on random resistor networks @xcite we neglect transport properties as the conductance etc . in other words : all we ask is wether two points on the lattice are connected or not .",
    "formally , we consider the limit of zero resistance of the conducting elements .    percolating clusters in space and time",
    "can be generated by a stochastic spreading process known as the general epidemic process ( gep ) @xcite . in order to apply field - theoretic methods",

    "this causality rule then forbids response propagator loops in the diagrammatical perturbation expansion .    using the path - integral formulation a renormalized field - theory of dynamic isotropic percolation",

    "@xmath41 constitutes the density of the immun ( or dead ) individuals and @xmath42 is a gaussian noise which is zero in spatial regions where the disease is extinguished .",
    "the deterministic drift of the disease in space is represented by the flow 2@xmath43 .    of course ,",
    "if the @xmath5-dimensional rotational symmetry is broken to @xmath44 -dimensional isotropy , the diffusion constants for longitudinal ( with respect to the direction @xmath38 ) and transversal spreading are in general different .",
    "thus we have to consider a more general diffusion operator @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "however , it is easy to see that the new parameter @xmath47 can be absorbed into the definition of the longitudinal length scale by @xmath48 followed by an appropriate change of the densities and the coupling constant @xmath49 .",
    "after that , diffusional spreading looks isotropic again .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 depends on the microscopic model .",
    "it is a redundant variable in the sense of wegner  @xcite and is responsible for the multicritical line in the rdn  @xcite . from the microscopic rdn - standpoint , the three variables @xmath50 , @xmath47 , @xmath51 are analytical functions of the three probabilities @xmath6",

    "remember that @xmath59 and @xmath11 defines the multicritical line .",
    "in this paper we are interested only in the static behavior of the process , i.e. , in the statistics of the distributions of immunes in space @xmath60 after a long time when the epidemic is extinguished .",
    "these distributions constitute isotropic percolating clusters at the critical point of the gep , which is given by @xmath61 and @xmath62 if we neglect fluctuation corrections .",
    "the density @xmath63 is proportional to the fourier transform of @xmath64 for frequency zero .",
    "the statistical weight for these frequency - zero modes can be found by invoking the formal limit @xmath65 for the fields in the dynamic functional @xmath66 , eq .",
    "( [ jfunkt ] ) .",
    "this manipulation can be controlled term by term in a diagrammatical perturbation expansion and leads to the wanted representation of the zero frequency green s functions as functional integrals with a weight @xmath67 and a quasistatic hamiltonian @xmath68\\varphi \\biggr\\}\\ .",
    "\\label{hamilt}\\ ] ] remember that closed loops of the response propagators are forbidden in the feynman diagrams as a consequence of the causality rule",
    ". therefore , the functional @xmath69 is , up to a rescaling , identical with the statistical functional considered by frey , tuber , and schwabl  @xcite in their work on the crossover from isotropic to directed percolation .    to absorb ultraviolet divergencies in a perturbational calculation of the green s functions with the hamiltonian @xmath69 we use , in the case @xmath70 , the following renormalization scheme  @xcite : @xmath71 here @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the usual external momentum scale , which makes the renormalized coupling constant @xmath75 dimensionless .",
    "note that the fields @xmath76 and @xmath77 are renormalized by the same @xmath78-factor as a consequence of the reflection symmetry @xmath79 of @xmath69 , which leads eventually to the equality @xmath80 between the exponents characterizing the particle density and the percolation probability .",
    "the renormalizations are known from percolation field theory up to three - loop order @xcite .",

    "now the isotropic percolation exponent @xmath183 is measured .",

    "fts renormalize @xmath47 also .",
    "they find that the anomalous dimension of @xmath47 is zero at the isotropic point .",
    "moreover , they calculate a nonvanishing anomalous dimension of @xmath47 at the directed fixed point .",
    "the variable @xmath47 ( or better @xmath184 , which couples to the composed field @xmath185 ) , being redundant at the isotropic fixed point , changes over to an irrelevant variable at the directed fixed point .",
    "thus , in order to renormalize it , one has to include all the irrelevant operators of equal naive dimension and symmetry which mix under renormalization .",
    "this was overlooked in the work of fts , thus the calculated anomalous dimension of @xmath184 is meaningless .",
    "the technical problem of the crossover from ip to dp is , as fts stated , that the two fixed points , which are to connect by the renormalization flow , have different upper critical dimensions , @xmath186 and @xmath187 , respectively .",
    "thus , one has from the outset the problem to renormalize the theory for general dimensions below @xmath186 and can not use the @xmath30-expansion , which by - passes the problem that the perturbation expansion is ill - defined if one uses critical massless propagators , leading to infrared ( ir ) divergencies below the upper critical dimension .",

    "asymptotic scaling properties follow from the inhomogeneous callan - symanzik equation .    below the upper critical dimension ,",

    "only the vertex function @xmath94 is uv divergent and can be renormalized by a mass shift @xmath188 , where @xmath189 absorbs the uv divergencies .",
    "if the theory is regularized dimensionally , these uv divergencies manifest themselves as poles at @xmath190 , @xmath191 @xcite , where , at the corresponding spatial dimensions @xmath192 , only perturbational contributions to @xmath94 of loop - order smaller then @xmath193 are superficially uv divergent .",

    "after the mass shift , the theory is uv - finite",
    ". then , however , in those dimensions corresponding to the before mentioned poles , non - analytic logarithmic behavior with respect to the coupling constant arises .",
    "an alternative dimensional regularization formalism was presented some time ago by schloms and dohm @xcite , henceforth called sd .",
    "this formalism circumvents renormalization conditions and resorts to the more convenient minimal renormalization but without using the @xmath30-expansion .",
    "the key feature of that formalism is to use the inverse correlation length itself as the mass - parameter @xcite and to define the minimal renormalization at a suitable renormalization point , which introduces the usual external mass scale @xmath74 .",
