    "until recently , the knowledge about helicity ",
    "dependent parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the nucleon mainly came from next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd fits ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to the helicity  dependent structure function @xmath5 , as measured in fixed ",
    "target polarized inclusive deep  inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting helicity  dependent pdf for the gluon has rather large uncertainties due to the fact that the exchanged virtual photon does not couple directly , i.e. , at leading order , to the gluon , and that an indirect way of accessing it via nlo fits to @xmath5 suffers from the limited kinematic reach of the fixed target experiments . accessing the helicity  dependent gluon pdf via the so - called photon - gluon - fusion process in semi - inclusive dis has not yet resulted in better constraints , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for details .",
    "thus , additional data from polarized @xmath0 scattering , in which longitudinally polarized gluons are directly probed via scattering off longitudinally polarized gluons or quarks , should reduce the uncertainties in the helicity  dependent gluon pdf .",
    "this has been demonstrated in a global nlo fit @xcite using , for the first time , the available inclusive and semi - inclusive polarized dis data together with first results from polarized @xmath0 scattering at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "the results included were the double helicity asymmetries in inclusive @xmath6 @xcite and jet @xcite production from the phenix and star experiments , respectively .",
    "the double helicity asymmetry in inclusive hadron production is given as @xmath7 where the cross section @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) describes the reaction where both protons have the same ( opposite ) helicity .",
    "the helicity  independent cross section is defined as @xmath10 . the helicity  dependent decomposition of the numerator is given on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ cross_sec_asy ] , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 represent the helicity  dependent pdfs for quarks or gluons , and @xmath13 are the helicity  dependent hard scattering cross sections calculable in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "the kinematic dependences of these terms are omitted for simplicity . at leading order ( lo ) the fragmentation functions",
    "@xmath14 can be interpreted as the probability for a certain parton @xmath15 to fragment into a certain hadron @xmath16 and thus they are not needed in the case of jet and direct photon production . in current global fits of parton helicity distributions , the fragmentation functions are assumed to be spin independent .",
    "this study focuses on the midrapidity cross section and double helicity asymmetry in inclusive @xmath2 production ( @xmath17 ) as a function of transverse momentum ( @xmath18 ) and the @xmath4 cross section ratio at @xmath19  gev measured at the phenix experiment at rhic .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath2 double helicity asymmetry adds independent data with different systematics to the present set of polarized data available to pdf fits .",
    "even when compared to a closely related data set , e.g. , the phenix @xmath6 data on double helicity asymmetries , the difference in the fragmentation functions can lead to a different sensitivity to certain helicity  dependent pdfs .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath6 , the experimental data available to extract @xmath2 fragmentation functions is rather limited .",
    "the existing @xmath2 cross section measurements from @xmath20 collider data can constrain the quark fragmentation functions to some degree , but the extraction of gluon fragmentation functions requires either rather precise @xmath20 data taken in a wide range of center of mass energies , or cross section measurements from processes where gluons are directly involved , e.g. , @xmath0 scattering .",
    "therefore , the data on cross sections and cross section ratios presented here serve as important input for the extraction of fragmentation functions , in particular as the measurement has been performed over a wide range of @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath2 ( @xmath6 ) meson is reconstructed through its main decay channel , @xmath21 , with a branching ratio ( br ) of about 39% ( 99% )  @xcite .",
    "the data were taken at the phenix @xcite experiment in 2005 and 2006 .",
    "after data quality and vertex cuts , @xmath22pb@xmath23 from the 2005 data and @xmath24pb@xmath23 from the 2006 data are used for the analysis .",
    "the data sets from both years are used for the extraction of the statistics ",
    "limited double helicity asymmetry in @xmath2 production while only the larger data set from 2006 is used for the extraction of the predominantly systematics ",
    "limited cross section measurements .",
    "note that the analysis described in the following , including all cuts , is done in the exact same way for the @xmath2 and the @xmath6 meson in order to minimize the systematic uncertainties on the @xmath4 cross section ratio presented below .",
    "two data sets have been analyzed , collected by requiring two different trigger selections .",
    "the minimum bias ( mb ) trigger requires coincident signals in two beam - beam counters ( bbcs )  @xcite , which are arrays of quartz - radiator erenkov counters providing full azimuthal coverage at pseudorapidities of @xmath25 .",
    "based on the timing of the signals from the two bbcs , the event vertex is reconstructed and required to be within 30  cm of the nominal interaction point .",
    "in addition to the mb trigger , the high-@xmath18 triggered data set requires an energy deposition larger than approximately 1.4  gev in an area of @xmath26 towers in the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal )  @xcite .",
    "the emcal is the primary detector used in this analysis , located at a radial distance of about 5  m from the beam pipe .",
    "it covers the pseudo  rapidity range @xmath27 and has an azimuthal acceptance of @xmath28 .",
    "the emcal consists of eight sectors , six of which are composed of a total of 15552 lead ",
    "scintillator ( pbsc ) sandwich towers ( 5.5  cm x 5.5  cm x 37.5  cm ) , and two sectors of lead - glass ( pbgl ) erenkov calorimeters , consisting of a total of 9216 towers ( 4  cm x 4  cm x 40  cm ) . for the cross section measurements only the pbsc was used .    a cluster in the emcal is assumed to originate from a photon if the following criteria are met .",
    "first , since showers in the emcal are not confined to a single tower , a shower profile analysis can be used to reject hadrons , which usually produce broader showers than photons .",
    "since hadrons are slower than photons , an additional time of flight cut is used for photon identification .",
    "furthermore , the cluster must not be associated with a hit from a charged particle in the pad chamber ( pc3 ) just in front of the emcal ; an exception is made if the hit position in the emcal and in the pc3 are aligned in such a way that the particle could have come from the vertex on a straight line , i.e. , it was not bent in the central magnetic field . in this case , the cluster is accepted as a photon candidate since it is likely that the original photon converted into an @xmath29 pair before the pc3 but outside the magnetic field .",
    "the latter two selection cuts are used in the analysis of the double helicity asymmetry but not in the extraction of the cross sections , leading to a smaller signal to background ratio in the cross section measurements . in order to exclude clusters with potentially incorrectly reconstructed energies due to leakage effects , the tower with the largest energy deposition in a cluster must not be in the outermost two columns or rows of an emcal sector .",
    "in addition , there must not be a noisy or dead tower in the eight towers surrounding the central one .    using all possible pairs of photon candidates , the two  photon",
    "invariant mass spectrum is calculated .",
    "an upper limit of 0.7 is placed on the energy asymmetry , @xmath30 , of the two cluster energies , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , in order to reduce the combinatorial background due to numerous low - energy background clusters .",
    "it is also checked that either of the two clusters coincides with an area in the emcal that caused a high-@xmath18 trigger .",
    "finally , the @xmath18 of the diphoton is required to be larger than 2  gev/@xmath15 . at smaller @xmath18 ,",
    "the uncertainties in the cross section extraction become too large due to large backgrounds and limited acceptance .",
    "peak for the high-@xmath18 triggered data set and for three different bins of @xmath18 .",
    "the selection cuts for the cross section extraction are used . ]    the @xmath2 and @xmath6 cross sections and the @xmath2 double helicity asymmetry are extracted in bins of @xmath18 . using the selection cuts for the cross section extraction on the high-@xmath18 triggered data set , the resulting invariant mass distributions in the vicinity of the @xmath2 peak are shown in fig .",
    "[ invmass ] for three different bins of @xmath18 . for bins at small @xmath18 ,",
    "the signal extraction is based on fits to the invariant mass distributions using a gaussian for the signal plus a second - order polynomial for the background that describe the vicinity of the @xmath2 and @xmath6 peaks very well . for @xmath33  gev/@xmath15",
    "the signal extraction based on fits becomes unreliable as limited statistics leads to large fluctuations in the fit results for the mean and width of the peaks .",
    "therefore , the mean and width are taken from a monte - carlo simulation , which describes the mean and width of the @xmath2 and @xmath6 peaks as a function of @xmath18 very well for bins below @xmath34  gev/@xmath15 , giving confidence in using them for the bins above . in these cases ,",
    "the number of background counts under the signal peak is estimated by using the number of counts in the sidebands .",
    "the sidebands are on both sides of the mean of the peak , between 4 and 7 ( 4 and 6 ) times the gaussian width of the peak for the cross section ( double helicity asymmetry ) analysis .",
    "however , the exact position and width of the sidebands are varied and possible effects are taken into account in the systematic uncertainty . in the mid-@xmath18 range between @xmath35  gev/@xmath15 and @xmath36  gev/@xmath15 , where statistics is sufficient for the fit results to be stable and the background in the vicinity of the peaks is approximately linear so that the sideband subtraction is applicable , both methods agree as expected .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath6 meson cross sections are calculated from @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the integrated luminosity , @xmath39 the acceptance , @xmath40 the trigger efficiency , @xmath41 the reconstruction efficiency , and @xmath42 the number of reconstructed mesons .    the luminosity is calculated from the number of mb events divided by the cross section for events selected by the mb trigger . for the latter , a value of 23.0  mb with a systematic uncertainty of 9.7% has been derived from vernier scan results  @xcite and an extrapolation for subsequent years .",
    "the acceptance is calculated from a monte - carlo simulation using , as an input , the map of noisy and dead cells also used in the data analysis .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the acceptance calculation is 3.6% ( 3% ) for the @xmath2 ( @xmath6 ) meson .",
    "the trigger efficiency for the mb data is given by the mb trigger efficiency for @xmath2 and @xmath6 production .",
    "the trigger efficiency for the high-@xmath18 triggered data set is given by the mb trigger efficiency times the efficiency of the high-@xmath18 trigger .",
    "the mb ( high@xmath18 ) trigger efficiency is determined by the ratio of the number of reconstructed @xmath6 or @xmath2 mesons in a high@xmath18 ( mb ) triggered sample in coincidence with the mb ( high@xmath18 ) trigger divided by the number of reconstructed @xmath6 or @xmath2 events without the coincidence .",
    "the mb trigger efficiency is 0.78 for both @xmath6 and @xmath2 mesons over the whole range of @xmath18 considered , with a systematic uncertainty of 3% .",
    "the high@xmath18 trigger efficiency reaches a plateau at a level of 0.90 for @xmath43  gev/@xmath15 and is also very similar for both mesons . due to the fact that the turn - on curve of the high @xmath18 trigger is very steep and reaches an efficiency of about 0.80 in the @xmath44  gev/@xmath15 bin",
    ", the efficiency for @xmath45  gev/@xmath15 has a large systematic uncertainty .",
    "therefore , the cross section calculation is based on the smaller mb triggered data set for @xmath45  gev/@xmath15 and on the high-@xmath18 triggered data set for larger transverse momenta . the reconstruction efficiency accounts for loss of photons due to conversion ( @xmath46% @xmath47% ) and due to the cut on the shower shape discussed above ( @xmath48% @xmath47% ) . in the case of @xmath6 production , merging of the two decay photons into a single cluster",
    "is considered for @xmath49  gev/@xmath15 .",
    "production at @xmath50  gev as a function of @xmath18 and its comparison to nlo pqcd calculations at three different scales @xmath51 .",
    "the error bars shown are the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature .",
    "not included is the overall normalization uncertainty of 9.7% .",
    "note that the fragmentation functions used in the calculations are partially constrained by this data .",
    "see text for details . ]",
    "the @xmath2 cross section as a function of @xmath18 between 2 and 20  gev/@xmath15 is shown in fig .  [ eta_cs ] and tabulated in table  [ table : cross ] .",
    "note that a bin  shift correction is applied in order to be able to plot each data point at the center of each given @xmath18 bin , which , due to the exponentially falling spectrum , does not represent the true physical value of the yield in that bin  @xcite .",
    "this in particular facilitates the calculation of the @xmath2/@xmath6 cross section ratio .",
