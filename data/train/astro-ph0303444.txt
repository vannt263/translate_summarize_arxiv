    "we present a mission concept for high resolution x - ray spectroscopy at e@xmath31  kev with a resolving power , @xmath06000 , ( c.f . @xmath11000 for _ chandra _ , xmm - newton ) .",
    "this resolution is physics - driven , since it allows the thermal widths of coronal x - ray lines to be measured , and astrophysics - driven , since 50  km  s@xmath2 resolves internal galaxy motions , and galaxy motions within larger structures .",
    "we can then do galaxy dynamics in x - rays .    as _ chandra _ and xmm have made clear the region of the spectrum below 1 kev is where most of the x - ray atomic transitions lie , and is comparable with the optical and ultraviolet bands in this richness of features .",
    "however , this band lags behind optical - uv spectroscopy .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of this soft x - ray band is the only part of ` discovery space ' for which present or future x - ray missions are not pushing for order of magnitude improvements .",
    "inoue ( 2001 ) showed how future missions compare to present and past ones in term of throughput , energy band , and angular resolution .",
    "we have now _ chandra _ that beats ground - based optical telescopes in terms of angular resolution ( though not hst ) , xmm - newton and then con - x and xeus , will have large throughput .",
    "con - x , and other smaller missions , will image above 10 kev for the first time .",
    "calorimeters will give high resolution in the iron k band ( the astro - e calorimeter has a resolution of 6  ev , the con - x calorimeter could reach 2 - 3  ev ) .",
    "what is really missing is high resolution ( e/@xmath45000 ) at low energy .",
    "because low energy x - rays only require short focal lengths , such a mission could be compact and rapidly repointed .",
    "this would allow us to ` x - ray the universe ' using the afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) as strong background sources of x - rays , and so illuminate the ` cosmic web ' .",
    "the cosmic web is predicted to contain most of the normal matter ( baryons ) in the nearby universe . a recent flurry of papers has shown that this warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) does exist , both locally ( nicastro et al .",
    "2002a b , sembach et al .",
    "2002 ) and at moderate redshift ( zappacosta et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the importance of this topic has led to the approval of spidr , a new midex mission .",
    "spidr will map the cosmic web of warm intergalactic gas in the far - uv ovi emission line at 1052 , and so will provide strong morphological tests of cosmic structure formation .",
    "we see a compelling need to go to the next level of the physics of this major , but elusive , component of our environment : how is the plasma moving",
    "? how is it ionized ?",
    "which type of supernova enriched it with heavy elements ?",
    "what is the history of the formation of the cosmic web , and how does this tie in with the destruction of the ` lyman - alpha forest ' of cooler material ?",
    "high resolution soft x - ray and far - uv spectra are the _ only _ means of studying the detailed physics of the warm gas of the cosmic web .",
    "gamma - ray bursts are excellent , though fleeting , background beacons for these investigations : grbs explode in galaxies spanning just the right redshift range , 1@xmath3z@xmath32 . despite their location in the distant universe ,",
    "the x - ray afterglows of grbs shine as brightly as the brightest sources in our own local milky way for a short time . by rapidly slewing a high resolution spectrometer into position to record the soft x - ray and fuv spectrum of a grb afterglow",
    ", we can gather 100 times more photons than missions that point at the only steady distant sources , high redshift quasars .",
    "this will let us study many absorption lines and resolve their profiles , so telling us about the physics of the gas in the cosmic web .    the grb soft x - ray /",
    "fuv spectra will carry the signatures of _ all _ material along the line of sight to the grb , separated out cleanly by redshift .",
    "this will include matter in the grb host galaxies , telling us the composition of galaxies during the ` age of star formation ' ( 1@xmath52 , madau et al .",
    "1996 ) and so testing theories of the star formation history of the universe .",
    "the intimate environs of a gamma - ray burst will also imprint their signature on the spectra , testing models for these most powerful explosions in the universe .",
    "this mission is the complement of the map and planck missions : they put constraints on one end of the process of cosmic structure formation ; this mission on the other .",
    "this mission concept is the result of several discussions with a large group of scientists during two meetings at johns hopkins university .",
    "the heart of the mission is a high resolution soft x - ray spectrometer , with 6  times the spectral resolution of _",
    "chandra_. a slitless fuv spectrograph will add the ovi line to the x - ray ovii and ovii lines , allowing us to distinguish photoionization from collisional ionization .",
    "a grb detector will trigger the spacecraft to slew the x - ray spectrometer onto the grb afterglow within a few minutes .",
    "( 10 minutes requirement , 1 minute goal . )",
    "the soft x - ray spectrometer will consist of : an * x - ray mirror * ( with a 5  arcsec hpd , image size ) , optimized for low energy performance ( @xmath31  kev ) , feeding photons to * diffraction gratings * deployed in an out - of - plane reflection configuration .",
    "the gratings disperse the photons onto an * array of ccd detectors * , which are also optimized for low energies .",
    "the spectral resolution achieved will be @xmath6=6000 ( 50  km  s@xmath2 ) over the energy range 0.11  kev , with a collecting area of 1000  @xmath7 - 2000  @xmath7 .",
    "replicated x - ray optics developed for con - x will be the basis of this design . the short focal length ( 2.5 - 3  meters ) of the x - ray telescope mimimizes the moment - of - inertia of the satellite , allowing faster slews .    to achieve the rapid response necessary to achieve these mission goals",
    ", the satellite will include a compact 2-stage grb detection and localization system based on the highly successful beppo - sax design : a * csi dodecahedron * to localize grb to @xmath81  degree , and a small * x - ray coded aperture telescope * with a 10 - 20  degree field of view that can localize bursts to an arcminute .",
    "this is sufficient to put the grb afterglow into the ( slitless ) spectrometer apertures .",
    "the x - ray ccds of the coded aperture telescope ( e.g. an xmm epic - pn wafer ) will record good quality x - ray spectra of the afterglows , a bonus for the mission science .",
    "it is well known that at high redshifts ( z@xmath92 ) most of the baryons in the universe lie in ` lyman - alpha forest clouds ' , at temperatures of @xmath10 k or less , and with densities only slightly above the average density of the universe ( overdensities of only 1 - 10 ) .",
    "but , in the second half of cosmic time , ( i.e. for the 7  gyr at z@xmath31 ) the number of baryons in lyman - alpha clouds decreases rapidly , while the number of baryons in galaxies and clusters of galaxies does not increase by the same factor .",
    "therefore one of the major problems of the modern cosmology is : _",
    "`` where do most baryons go at low redshift ? ''",
    "_    the leading solution to the ` missing baryons ' problem is the concept of a ` warm - hot intergalactic medium ' ( whim ) .",
    "this concept has been developed in the last few years by cen & ostriker ( 1999 ) , and by other groups , ( see dav et al . 2000 and references therein ) :",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of the evolution of structures in the universe showed , surprisingly , that 30 - 40% of the baryons at z@xmath31 are in a warm ( @xmath11 k ) phase at overdensities between 10 and 200 .",
    "most ( 70% ) of these baryons should be at only a weak overdensity @xmath360 , and so are not virialized and are unbound . the resulting x - ray",
    "` forest ' of absorption lines will show us the structure of the universe developing over the last 7  gyr ( hellsten et al . 1998 ) .",
    "since this structure depends on what physics causes the primordial fluctuations seen in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) to grow into the galaxies and clusters of galaxies we see today , the x - ray forest will constrain that fundamental physics .",
    "a _ chandra _ spectrum was recently used to discover x - ray absorption at zero redshift due to the whim ( nicastro et al . , 2002a ) , following years of frustrating upper limits ( aldcroft et al .",
    "the whim thus does exist , at least locally and along on a single line of sight , and with the predicted overdensity .",
    "the bare detection of collisional ovi , ovii and oviii lines is a prime scientific result , strongly corroborating the results of a decade of forefront cosmological modeling .",
    "most likely the igm component found by nicastro et al .",
    "is a cut through the ` local filament ' associated with the local group of glaxies ( which is dominated by the milky way and andromeda spirals . )",
    "examined in this light fuse detections of zero redshift absorption toward many agn implies that we are embedded in a whim filament of the cosmic web .",
    "nicastro et al .",
    "( 2002b , see also sembach et al .",
    "2002 ) demonstrate that these ovi absorbers are at rest in the frame of our local group of galaxies , but not in any milky way frame of reference .",
    "this clinches the extragalactic location of this highly ionized gas .",
    "moreover , the mass of gas implied is enough to bind the local group gravitationally , which begins to put interesting limits on the amount of ` dark matter ' in our vicinity .    ,",
    "neix , oviii , ovii@xmath12 , and oi@xmath13 resonant lines , from the letgs spectrum.,height=264 ]    to understand the structure of the warm igm making up the cosmic web will require many more directions to be probed to distances well beyond our parochial group of galaxies . observing out to z=2 along many lines of sight will let us see the scales on which the web has formed and will show us how the web has grown and been filled with x - ray hot gas , gradually replacing the cooler ` lyman - alpha forest ' gas . as we show later ,",
    "quasars are a poor choice of background source ; grbs are far better .",
    "the breakthrough science of the cosmic web will come from _ measuring the widths of the oxygen lines_. this will allow a series of new tests of cosmological models for example , hydrodynamical simulations suggest that the igm matter is heated to @xmath11 k by shocks during the collapse of density perturbations .",
    "if this is the case one would expect that the turbulent velocities in the shocked gas of the same order of magnitude as its sound speed , i.e. of the order of 100 - 200 km / s .",
    "this is a several times the thermal velocity of the heavier oxygen atoms ( at @xmath14 k , the temperature at which the baryon density peaks in hydrodynamical simulations , dav et al .",
    "2000 ) . detecting line widths of 100 - 200",
    "km  s@xmath2 would point toward shocks as main source of large scale heating of the gas .",
    "this would contrast with competing sources such as supernova heating , and so determine the heating mechanism .",
    "grb soft x - ray / fuv afterglow spectroscopy will allow these tests to be carried out .",
    "prompt observations of grb afterglows offer a new and distinctive path for the study of the matter in the immediate surroundings of the grb ( r@xmath8100  pc ) and in the grb host galaxy ( fiore et al .",
    "this is the second main science driver for this mission . around @xmath15",
    "is the age of star formation ( madau et al .",
    "1998 ) , and many grbs are found at such redshifts .    as a result grbs can be a powerful tool to determine the history of the metal enrichment in galaxies in the universe ( fiore 2000 , 2001 , savaglio , fall & fiore 2002 ) , which can then be compared with enrichment predictions of theoretical models ( e.g. cen & ostriker 1999 ) , to pin down their several , now unconstrained , assumptions .",
    "grb host galaxies appear typical of normal star - forming field galaxies at the same large redshifts ( bloom et al .",
    "2001 , djorgovski et al .",
    "moreover grbs occur well within the main body of their host galaxies , not in the outer haloes .",
    "best of all , since grb host galaxies are @xmath16-ray and x - ray selected they will be virtually unbiased against dusty environments , a serious limitation of all present studies of high  z galaxies .",
    "optical spectra demonstrate clearly that grb observations can be used to probe the ism of the grb host galaxy . using a grb afterglow spectrum , castro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discovered two absorption systems in the grb host galaxy separated by just @xmath17  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "but optical observations are unable to investigate the abundant hot material expected .",
    "neither can normal ultraviolet , or infrared , telescopes detect this material .",
    "only the far - uv and soft x - ray bands contain the necessary spectral signatures .",
    "the soft x - ray band will measure ovii and oviii , while the fuv band will measure ovi .",
    "the ratios of these lines will determine the temperature of the whim for each line of sight ( figure 2 ) .",
    "crucially , the two line ratios come from 3 ions of the same atom . if the ratios disagree on the temperature",
    ", then we will know that we are not dealing with a simple collisional plasma ( nicastro et al .",
    "2002a ) .",
    "the soft x - ray spectra will also contain neix , while the fuv contains iron , magnesium , silicon , silicium , carbon and zinc and hydrogen lyman-@xmath18 lines . with the oxygen ratios distinguishing unambiguously between photoionization and collisional ionization",
    ", these other lines will give us abundances and enrichment histories .",
    "this will tell us the history of supernovae , and of the recycling of matter from galaxies and quasars .",
    "some elements condense onto dust grains more easily than others ( pettini et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) , so the dust content of the universe will also be measured .",
    "dust is a catalyst for further star formation , and so the whim dust content should link with the star formation history of the universe .",
    "dust dims light from more distant objects , and allowing for this ( probably small ) effect might change the cosmological parameters derived from sn1a light curves .",
    "the spectroscopic goals above are challenging .",
    "they require a large number of photons in each spectrum .",
    "we can use the example of the chandra letgs / hrc pks  2155 - 305 spectrum of nicastro et al .",

    "the computation of the grb position will be greatly speeded up since there will be only a single source producing mask shadows on the detector .",
    "our science goals show that we need to design an x - ray telescope providing an effective area of at least 1000  @xmath57 below 1  kev .",
    "the mirror needs a relatively sharp psf ( hpd@xmath85  arcsec ) in order to produce high spectral resolution using gratings .",
    "there are reasons for optimism that 5  arcsec hpd can be obtained .",
    "silicon carbide shells built by the merate ( italy ) group ( citterio , pareschi and collaborators ) have 11  arcsec hew figure errors .",
    "these shells are 2 mm thick , 60 cm diameter , 3.5 m focal length , and have a weight / effective area ratio of 0.06 kg  @xmath7 .",
    "mandrel quality is expected to improve ( pareschi et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the hew should roughly scale linearly with the thickness down to about a hew of 5 arcsec , where other effects start to be more important than the mirror deformations",
    ".    for a small mission weight is a major constraint . as a rough estimate",
    "the mirror will need a support structure of similar weight .",
    "the detector and its associated electronics will likely have a similar mass , and the total payload will likely be 50% of the total mass to orbit , the spacecraft taking the remaining fraction . the mirror should then account for about 10% of the total to - orbit mass . for a midex the mass to orbit is about 1000  kg ) , this implies a mirror mass of @xmath3100  kg . we have explored the mirror parameter space with the mirror raytrace code kindly provided by leon van speybroeck .",
    "this code was used extensively for _ chandra _ design and development . we show here the results of three representative design options : thin vs. thick shells , short vs. long focal length , and iridium vs. nickel coating .",
    "they give a feel for the effective areas which the x - ray mirror can achieve within the parameter space .",
    "the effective area results for simulations of mirror designs assuming a ` minimal ' mass telescope , and a ` maximal ' mass telescope ( figure  7 ) . in both designs various combination of mirror coatings have been used , with ni being used on the outer shells and ir on the inner shells .",
    "nickel provides better reflectivity below 0.8  kev , and iridium above 0.8  kev , so the mixed coating designs use iridium for the inner shells , and nickel for the outer shells .",

    "if the xmm - newton rgs reflection grating facets were used behind the _ chandra _ mirror the result would be @xmath58 ( subject to better facet alignment , elvis 2001 ) .",
    "but is @xmath59 feasible in a small mission ?",
    "x - ray calorimeters have excellent quantum efficiency and are the natural spectrometer of choice at the 6.4  kev fe - k complex .",
    "however they are not a good choice at 0.5  kev , since their resolution is fixed in ev , so @xmath6 degrades linearly with energy .",
    "the con - x calorimater goal is to have @xmath60=1  ev , or @xmath6=500 at 0.5  kev .",
    "gratings are a requirement for this mission .",
    "a route to achieving @xmath59 with 5  arcsec hpd mirrors is offered by out - of - plane reflection gratings ( orgs , cash 1991 ) .",
    "orgs are being considered to boost the resolution of the con - x low energy spectrometers to @xmath6=1000 - 2000 .",
    "spectral resolution improves linearly with angular resolution .",
    "so with a factor 3 better mirror , and an optimized alignment , @xmath59 becomes feasible .",
    "orgs also have favorable efficiency , peaking at @xmath810 - 15% .",
    "4% of the xmm rgs , and the 10% of the _ chandra _ letgs ) , so requiring a smaller mirror to feed them photons .",
    "filters are needed to eliminate stray optical light . to avoid losses at and above the 0.28  kev carbon edge",
    ", we will use aluminum filters , which have an edge at 1.5  kev , above our primary range of interest .",
    "similar filters have been successfully flown on other missions .",
