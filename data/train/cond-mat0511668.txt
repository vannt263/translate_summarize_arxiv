    "the recent interests in a possible correlated many particle state @xcite at very low electron density of a two dimensional electron system ( 2des ) have sparked a series of experimental investigations in different materials.@xcite in these experiments , the spin susceptibility , @xmath0 , which is proportional to the product of effective mass , m * , and g - factor , g * , usually deviates from its noninteracting  bare \" band edge value , @xmath4 , and increases drastically with decreasing electron density .",
    "the focus of these experiments is on the low density region , whereas @xmath0 has not been pursued to high densities .",
    "while we expect m*g * to approach @xmath4 in the high density limit , the explicit behavior in the intermediate regime remains experimentally unresolved .",
    "the density dependence of @xmath0 is usually expressed in terms of the dimensionless parameter , @xmath5 .",
    "it is defined as the average e - e distance measured in units of the bohr radius , which is also the ratio of coulomb energy to fermi energy . in 2d , @xmath6{n}$ ] , the intermediate density regime resides at @xmath7 and the high density regime at @xmath8 .",
    "high @xmath5 measurements of @xmath9 from different materials generally differ from each other and from theory .",
    "most early calculations@xcite produced the sharp rise of @xmath0 at low densities , but differed quantitatively from experiments .",
    "of those , data on very thin alas@xcite quantum wells came closest to theory , probably since the latter omitted finite thickness effects .",
    "indeed , recent calculation @xcite have shown that most of the discrepancies arise from the finite thickness of the 2des and the resulting modification of the coulomb interaction .",
    "these calculations for @xmath0 extend far into the weak interaction regime , yet there are presently no data available to test their validity .",
    "an additional incentive for such measurement is the fact that an empirical relation for @xmath0 , observed in the low - density regime @xcite , when extrapolated to high density would imply vanishing @xmath0 , whereas one expects @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    "we provide high quality data on @xmath0 through the intermediate interaction regime and towards small @xmath5 for comparison with recent , realistic theoretical calculations .",
    "once the data are corrected for the energy dependence of band mass and g - factor , theory and experiment reach a remarkable level of accord and the data show the correct limiting behavior for large densities .",
    "our primary sample is a heterojunction - insulated gate field effect transistor ( higfet ) .",
    "it consists of a @xmath11 buffer gaas layer grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) on a ( 001 ) gaas substrate . a subsequently grown , 200 period superlattice of 10 nm @xmath12 and 3 nm gaas acts as a diffusion barrier .",
    "it is followed by @xmath11 of undoped gaas , which functions as the channel .",
    "this layer is covered by 5 nm of alas and @xmath13 of @xmath12 , being the dielectric material , topped by 25 nm of heavily doped gaas , which serves as the gate .",
    "the specimen is processed into a @xmath14 square mesa .",
    "we use standard photolithography to define fifteen ni - ge - au contact pads .",
    "our specimen has mobilities as high as @xmath15 .",
    "the density , @xmath16 , can be tuned by varing the gate voltage , @xmath17 . for this sample , @xmath18 .",
    "such a higfet allows us to measure a wide range of densities in a single specimen , eliminating sample to sample parameter fluctuations . for our sample , which has a density range spanning from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , the @xmath5 value can be tuned from 0.9 to 6 , covering a wide range of e - e interaction strength .",
    "all measurements were performed in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of @xmath21 .",
    "the sample was mounted on a rotating sample holder to control separately the total magnetic field , @xmath22 , and the field , @xmath23 , perpendicular to the 2des .",
    "we used conventional low frequency ac lock - in techniques with excitation currents ranging from 1na to 100na , chosen to avoid sample heating .",
    "we determine the spin susceptibility , @xmath0 , by the tilted field method@xcite , in the context of gaas higfets@xcite .",
    "we briefly review the method , referring to ref.@xcite for details : for a 2d system in a magnetic field , the spacing between landau levels , @xmath24 , depends on the perpendicular field @xmath23 , while the zeeman energy @xmath25 , depends on the total magnetic field , @xmath22 .",
    "when @xmath26 , where the coincidence index , @xmath27 , is an integer or a half - integer@xcite , the landau levels of the spin - up and spin - down electrons form a ladder of evenly spaced energy levels . a schematic diagram of evenly spaced energy levels is shown for @xmath28 as an insert to figure 1 .     a typical gate sweep trace showing the coincidence condition for @xmath28 , at @xmath29 and tilt angle=@xmath30",
    "the arrow indicates the density for coincidence to be @xmath31 .",
    "inset : schematic diagram for the @xmath28 coincidence , where spin splittings from the same and neighboring landau levels are evenly spaced.,width=283 ]    the coincidence condition has a clear signature in the oscillation amplitudes of the magnetoresistance . in a density sweep at fixed @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and assuming m * and g * not to depend on density , such evenly spaced energy levels reveal themselves as uniform oscillation of uniform amplitudes . however , in general , m * and g * depend on electron density and therefore such equal amplitude oscillations only appear at a particular density , @xmath16 . only at this particular @xmath16 the value of @xmath34 . as an example , fig .",
    "1 shows such a sweep for the i=1/2 coincidence .",
    "2 shows the so determined @xmath16-dependent values of m*g*. our data cover low @xmath5 values and , hence , persist into the low interaction regime , whereas earlier data by zhu et al.(also shown ) are limited to the high interaction regime(@xmath35 ) .",
    "our data were taken in two different perpendicular fields @xmath36 and @xmath29 , both using the coincidence index @xmath28 .",
    "the error bars in the y - direction represent the uncertainties in angle measurements . for comparison , we also show the low - density data for the @xmath28 taken at @xmath29 from ref.@xcite .",
    "the small difference between our @xmath29 data and theirs is most likely due to a slightly thinner wave function thickness owing to the extra alas layer in our sample(see above ) .",
    "spin susceptibility @xmath0 versus electron density .",
    "black squares are measurements for @xmath28 in perpendicular field , @xmath36 ; grey circles are data for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the error bars in @xmath0 represents the uncertainties in angle .",
    "errors in density are smaller than the symbol size .",
    "open symbols represent data of same - shaped filled symbols after corrected for band structure effects .",
    "the extrapolation of @xmath0 to @xmath37 is plotted as a dashed line(see text ) . after this correction",
    "the right scale becomes effectively @xmath38 , which is used in fig .",
    "low density data from ref.@xcite are plotted for comparison.,width=340 ]    to put the main features of our data in perspective , we first follow the conventional way of normalizing the @xmath0 data simply to the literature band edge values of @xmath4 .",
    "we provide this scale on the right side of fig.2 clearly the spin susceptibility decreases monotonically with increasing density from 3.4 to 0.88 for electron densities from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . on this log - log plot ,",
    "the data from each @xmath23 follow a power law behavior with a similar slope as observed earlier in the low density regime @xcite .",
    "obviously the data drop below @xmath39 for high densities , which is unphysical and contradicts all theoretical predictions . however , bandstructure effects , which modify the  bare \" mass and g - factor of the carriers , alter the powerlaw and prevent this from occurring . while such effects are negligible in the low density regime , they are appreciable at higher densities and need to be corrected for",
    ". in particular , in gaas , the band mass @xmath40 increases with increasing density , while the magnitude of the g - factor , @xmath41 , decreases , with the latter being dominant .",
    "data and fit for coefficient @xmath42 from literature values@xcite ( see text and equation ( 1)).,width=283 ]    the density dependence of the electron band mass in a 2des in gaas due to band nonparabolicity has been widely studied and can be readily calculated @xcite . for our density range @xmath19 to @xmath20 ,",
    "the enhancement of @xmath40 grows from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "the density dependence of the @xmath45-factor is more complex . in a 2des ,",
    "this dependence was first observed by stein et al .",
    "@xcite using electron spin resonance ( esr ) and was later studied systematically via esr by dobers et al.@xcite .",
    "they deduced an empirical formula @xmath46 , where n is the landau level index , @xmath33 is the magnetic field , and @xmath47 and c are two coefficients that may change with electron density .",
    "the observation was explained theoretically @xcite as a combination of nonparabolicity of the band structure and an increase of the penetration of the electron wavefunction into the algaas layer .",
    "since the @xmath45-factor of @xmath48 changes considerably with aluminum concentration and has a different sign from @xmath49 in gaas , the magnitude of the @xmath45-factor shrinks with increasing penetration of the electron wavefunction . in order to correct our data ,",
    "we use the existing measurements@xcite of @xmath47 and c values from samples with electron densities from @xmath50 to @xmath51 . adding @xmath52 for @xmath53 , we interpolate and achieve the phenomenological dependence , @xmath54 where @xmath16 is in @xmath55(see fig.3 ) . the coefficient c is assumed constant , c=0.012 , since it hardly varies in ref.@xcite . while dobers et al .",
    "used an al concentration of @xmath56 , the interface in our sample consists of @xmath57 al . from band structure calculations we can estimate that such a @xmath57 al concentration at the interface reduces the g - factor renormalization by @xmath58 as compared to @xmath56 al .",
    "when combined with a smaller penetration into the alas layer , the final enhancement @xmath59 is affected by less than @xmath60 at our highest @xmath5 and has no observable effect for @xmath61 . a similar estimate yields a variation of c by less than @xmath62 from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "these calculations are approximate .",
    "however , we deem them sufficient since their impact on our data resides within the experimental error bar .    the open symbols in fig .",
    "2 represent all our @xmath0 data corrected for the density dependence of mass and g - factor .",
    "as required , all data remain above @xmath39 and they seem to be levelling off as n increases . since we have been working with a small spin polarization ( @xmath28 ) our data can be assumed to be close to the unpolarized(_i.e . _ @xmath37 ) case , which is the condition used in most theoretical calculations and therefore of importance for comparisons with experiment .",
    "based on the @xmath22-dependence of our low - density data we can actually provide an extrapolation scheme to @xmath37 , which , since it is a small correction , should hold over the extended high density range provided here .",
    "normalized spin susceptibility enhancement @xmath0 versus @xmath5 .",
    "the open symbols are data corrected for band structure effects due to nonparabolicity .",
    "the extrapolation to @xmath65 is shown as a dashed line as in fig.2 . @xmath40 and @xmath66 denote the bare m and g values after corrected for band structure effect .",
    "the solid curves of different grey scale are theoretical calculations from ref.@xcite .",
    "the topmost curve is for a zero - thickness 2des , whereas all other solid curves are for finite thickness gaas systems.,width=340 ]    we observe that the @xmath36 data and the @xmath29 data are slightly offset from each other in the vertical direction . in particular , at lower densities both",
    "follow the previously observed powerlaw , which had allowed for a simple extrapolation scheme@xcite to @xmath37 .",
    "this extrapolation , based on different coincidence indices , @xmath27 , can directly be translated to different @xmath23 and identical @xmath28 as is the case in the present measurements ( see footnote @xcite ) .",
    "the result is a constant multiplicative factor , which appears as a small downward shift on our log - log plot of fig .",
    "2 is shown as a dashed line .",
    "while this extrapolation scheme is derived in the range of the powerlaw dependence between @xmath0 and n of our data , we expect it to apply approximately also in the range of saturating @xmath0 towards higher densities .    an enhancement of m * and a deduced increase of g * by a high in - plane magnetic field has been reported by tutuc et al.@xcite according to their observations , the mass enhancement for our largest in - plane field of @xmath67 , at density @xmath68 , is approximately @xmath69 .",
    "extrapolating their g * enhancement to this density and field , we find it to be less than @xmath70 .",
    "our @xmath0 enhancement from the @xmath71 extrapolation is @xmath72 , which is close to the overall @xmath73 increase deduced from ref.@xcite .",
    "this supports that our method , which _ extrapolates _ the spin susceptibility to vanishing @xmath33 field , @xmath74 , is not sensitive to in - plane field effects on m * and g*.    fig 4 shows our final results as @xmath0 versus @xmath5 , rather than versus density , for better comparison with theory . the symbols and lines refer back to fig.2 .",
    "the data points as well as the extrapolated curve show the correct limiting behavior of @xmath3 as @xmath8 as a consequence of the correction of the data for band structure effects . without such correction",
    ", the @xmath0 data would have fallen below @xmath39 , which would be clearly unphysical .",
    "finally , we can compare our data with theory . in the past two decades",
    ", there have been several calculations of the spin susceptibility @xmath0 , but most of them evaluate @xmath0 in the limit of zero polarization in an ideal 2des . a figure summarizing those theoretical results can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the calculations from different techniques are in rather good agreement for @xmath75 but deviate considerably for large @xmath5 . in the same regime , measurements of @xmath0 in different 2dess have also shown considerable discrepancies . a recent report of depalo et al , attributes many of these discrepancies to the finite thickness of the real 2des and variations of this thickness between 2dess from different material systems .",
    "for comparison with our data , extrapolated to @xmath76 ( dashed line ) , we have included in fig.4 the zero thickness result and the finite thickness result for gaas from ref@xcite .",
    "the calculations from zhang and das sarma@xcite using an improved rpa and dharma - wadana@xcite using a chnc method both reside further below our data .",
    "as can be seen from fig.4 , our experimental data and the theoretical calculations for a realistic 2des in gaas show rather good agreement . for high @xmath5 values ,",
    "this had been pointed out before@xcite . here",
    "we show that after appropriate correction for band structure effects , one also achieves good agreement in the intermediate interaction regime ( @xmath7 ) and obtains the correct trend for @xmath77 .",
    "in conclusion , our data on the spin susceptibility of a 2des in gaas over a very wide of electron densities , covering @xmath5 values from strong electron interactions ( @xmath78 ) through the intermediate interaction regime ( @xmath7 ) , and into the low interaction regime show the correct trends for the limiting behavior ( @xmath77 ) of this quantity .",
    "only when theory takes into account the finite thickness of the real 2des and experiment is corrected for band structure effects , a rather good agreement between data and calculation is reached over the whole range of @xmath5 of this study .",
    "our work highlights the fact that subtleties of the real 2des need to be taken into account when comparison with theoretical calculations are being made ."
