    "one of the central problems in astronomy is that of galaxy formation and evolution : when were the various parts of galaxies assembled , when were the stars formed , and how did these processes depend on environment ? at low redshift the dependence of many galaxy properties on environment is well established .",
    "dense environments contain a larger fraction of red , passive galaxies , while low density environments contain more blue , star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the distributions of colour and h@xmath5 equivalent width , and hence inferred star - formation histories , are found to be bimodal @xcite . surprisingly , the two sequences vary little with environment , except in terms of their relative proportions @xcite .",
    "however , some studies find that star - forming galaxies in clusters tend to have a reduced global star formation rate with respect to field galaxies of the same morphological type @xcite .",
    "the chemical abundances of stars and interstellar gas within galaxies provide a fundamental tool for tracing the evolution of their stellar and metal content .",
    "these abundances depend on various physical processes , such as the star formation history , gas outflows and inflows , etc .",
    "variation in the chemical enrichment of galaxies may potentially provide insight into how environment affects galaxy evolution .",
    "measurements of this variation can thus assist in constraining the likely scenarios of galaxy evolution .",
    "the correlation between galaxy metallicity and luminosity is one of the most significant observational results in chemical evolution studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of large samples of star - forming galaxies shows that metallicity correlates with luminosity over @xmath6 magnitudes , with a factor of @xmath7 increase in metallicity @xcite .",
    "the metallicity relation is tighter versus stellar mass than luminosity @xcite .",
    "spectrophotometric observations of hii regions for a sample of nine virgo cluster spiral galaxies have shown that hi - deficient objects , near the cluster core , appear to have higher oxygen abundance than field galaxies of comparable luminosity or morphology ( @xcite ) .",
    "oxygen abundances of spirals at the periphery of the cluster with normal hi properties are however indistinguishable from those of field galaxies ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for similar results ) . due to their lower gravitational potentials ,",
    "dwarf galaxies ought to be more sensitive to their surroundings and should especially be less able to retain their gaseous contents . for a sample of dwarf star forming galaxies located at different environments , @xcite found that galaxies located in low density regions tend to display higher excitation - sensitive emission line ratios , with higher emission line equivalent widths and total luminosities .",
    "dwarf galaxies appear however to follow the same metallicity - luminosity relation , i.e. , at a given luminosity , there is no systematic difference in oxygen abundance between cluster and field star - forming dwarf galaxies . @xcite",
    "have confirmed this result for a sample of dwarf irregulars in the virgo cluster .",
    "a subsample of virgo star - forming galaxies display a much lower baryonic gas fraction than their counterparts in the field at comparable oxygen abundances .",
    "they argue that the observed gas - poor star forming galaxies have being stripped of their gaseous content without significant effect on their luminosities and metallicities .    the large dispersion in the chemical properties of field galaxies ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , and",
    "previous small sample sizes in dense regions make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding the effect of environment on the chemical properties of galaxies .",
    "the large data sets provided by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) now allow the environmental effects on galaxy properties to be followed statistically over the full range of environments , from the sparse field to dense cluster cores , at least for bright galaxies .",
    "additionally , the homogeneity of the sdss sample enables us to sample the entire range of galactic environments , in a uniform manner .",
    "we can now , therefore , expand the study of galaxy chemical properties from the usual cluster versus field comparison to general environment , in this case characterised by local density , irrespective of actual cluster or group membership .",
    "this will help strongly in constraining the physical processes responsible for determining galaxy properties . in this paper ,",
    "we analyze the variation in oxygen abundance of the interstellar star - forming gas for a large sample of local galaxies as a function of their stellar mass and environment , in order to investigate environmental effects on the chemical content of galaxies , and how it depends on galaxy mass .",

    "similar to the stellar mass versus oxygen abundance relation , the correlation between the specific star formation rate and the stellar mass of star - forming galaxies shows very little dependence on local galaxy density from void - like environments , i.e. , @xmath66 , to the periphery of galaxy clusters , i.e. , @xmath3 . for star - forming galaxies in dense regions ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath49 , the median of the specific star formation rate distribution is , however , @xmath67 dex higher than for galaxies with similar stellar masses in less dense regions .",

    "the stellar mass versus gas - phase oxygen abundance relationship appears to be environment - free over a large range of local galaxy densities . for galaxies located in environments with local galaxy densities typical of the inner regions of galaxy clusters ,",
    "the interstellar star - forming gas is found to be slightly overabundant compared to what is found for their counterparts of similar stellar masses in less dense environments .",
    "this change in oxygen abundance increases as galaxy stellar mass decreases , ranging from @xmath70 dex for galaxies with stellar mass larger than @xmath71 to @xmath72 dex for galaxies with stellar mass around @xmath73 .    over that last few years",
    ", observational evidence has been accumulating that the dominant evolution in the galaxy population properties as a function of environment is the change of the ratio between star - forming / blue galaxies and passive / red galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "the environmental dependence of different galaxy properties , i.e. , colour , concentration index , colour gradient , are found to be almost entirely due to the dependences of galaxy morphology and luminosity on the environment : when morphology and luminosity are fixed , galaxy physical properties are nearly independent of local galaxy density @xcite .",
    "the scaling relations for both passive and star - forming galaxies are virtually unaffected by environment . studies of the fundamental plane have shown that the properties of early - type galaxies are nearly independent of environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the scaling relations for star - forming galaxies are virtually unchanged with environment , whilst over the same density range the fraction of star - forming galaxies is changing strongly ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "our finding that oxygen abundances of galaxies with a given stellar mass depend weakly on environment is consistent with ( i ) the weak dependence on environment of the mean colour , at a given luminosity , of blue galaxies that are still actively growing and evolving , compared with the dependence on luminosity , the strongest effect also being seen for faint galaxies @xcite , and ( ii ) the lack of any environmental effect on the distribution of the emission line equivalent width for star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "the weak dependence of the star - forming gas oxygen abundance shown here is a further suggestion that the primary physical driver(s ) of galaxy evolution must depend primarily on galaxy intrinsic properties rather than on their environment .",
    "in addition , whatever mechanism is responsible for the increasing fraction of passive galaxies in dense environments , it must truncate their star formation on a short timescale to avoid affecting the relations of oxygen abundance and specific star - formation versus stellar mass for actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "yet @xcite have argued , based on the absence of dependence on environment of the correlations between different spectral indicators that probe star formation history on different timescales ( @xmath74 ) , that the decrease in star formation activity in dense environments occurs over long ( @xmath75 ) timescales .",
    "it is not clear however how slow quenching could affect the chemical properties of galaxies , and for which kind of star formation histories galaxies would move along the observed relations in different environments .",
    "self - consistent modelling is clearly needed in order to set tight constraints on quenching timescales from observed chemical and spectro - photometric properties of galaxies .",
    "this is obviously well beyond the scope of this paper , and we will leave it for future investigations .",
    "the modest change of oxygen abundances of star - forming galaxies in regions with local galaxy densities typical of the inner regions of galaxy clusters indicates however that the chemical evolution of galaxies is moderately modulated by the environment .",
    "furthermore , the mechanism responsible for this change must be more efficient in low stellar mass galaxies , as the change of oxygen abundances is larger for those galaxies .",
    "the relationship between stellar mass and oxygen abundance can be understood either as a sequence in astration , i.e. , more massive galaxies are able to convert a larger fraction of their gas into stars than low mass counterparts , or as a depletion sequence , i.e. , the efficiency of galaxies to retain their gas increases with galaxy mass . based on the correlation between effective yield and baryonic mass for local star - forming galaxies , @xcite have argued that the most straightforward interpretation of the correlation is the selective loss of metals from galaxies with shallow potential wells via galactic winds .",
    "this suggests that the change of 0.020.08 dex in the mean gas - phase oxygen abundance of star - forming galaxies as a function of environment can be explained by a reduced effectiveness of galactic winds in removing metals from the potential wells of low mass halos in dense regions .",
    "there is consequently more gas left to be turned into stars .",
    "massive galaxies can however retain all their gas whether they are in the field or in a cluster .",
    "in this scenario , therefore , the efficiency of star formation within low mass halos is higher in the presence of a confining intergalactic medium , because supernovae are less efficient at removing gas from a galaxy if there is hot material surrounding the galaxy .",
    "an alternative explanation of the observed mass - dependent change in oxygen abundances of galaxies as a function of environment might be that low stellar mass galaxies have assembled their stellar contents at a faster rate in denser regions .",
    "whatever triggers star formation in galaxy clusters , it causes it to happen rapidly , hence increasing the efficiency of recycling during star formation .",
    "environment - driven processes , i.e. , tidal interactions , mergers , could enhance the star formation activity in low mass galaxies in cluster environment",
    ". the observed systematic difference of specific star formation rate between field and cluster galaxies may be the signature of such an effect ."
