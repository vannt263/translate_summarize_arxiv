    "the present paper is concerned with the numerical simulation of stochastic partial differential equations ( spde s ) used to model excitable cells in order to analyze the effect of noise on such biological systems .",
    "our aim is twofold .",
    "the first is to propose an efficient and easy - to - implement method to simulate this kind of models .",
    "we focus our work on practical numerical implementation with software used for deterministic pde s such as freefem++ @xcite or equivalent .",
    "the second is to analyze the effect of noise on these systems thanks to numerical experiments .",
    "namely , in models for cardiac cells , we investigate the possibility of purely noise induced reentrant patterns such as spiral or scroll - waves as these phenomena are related to major troubles of the cardiac rhythm such as tachyarrhythmia . for numerical experiments , we focus on the barkley and mitchell - schaeffer models , both originally deterministic models to which we add a noise source . + mathematical models for excitable systems may describe a wide range of biological phenomena . among these phenomena ,",
    "the most known and studied are certainly the two following ones : the generation and propagation of the nerve impulse along a nerve fiber and the generation and propagation of a cardiac pulse in cardiac cells . for both , following the seminal work @xcite , very detailed models known as conductance based models have been developed , describing the physio - biological mechanism leading to the generation and propagation of an action potential .",
    "these physiological models are quite difficult to handle mathematically and phenomenological models have been proposed .",
    "these models describe qualitatively the generation and propagation of an action potential in excitable systems . for instance , the morris - lecar model for the nerve impulse and the fitzhugh - nagumo model for the cardiac potential . in the present paper",
    ", we will consider two phenomenological models : the barkley and the mitchell - schaeffer models .",
    "+ mathematically , the models that we will consider consist in a degenerate system of partial differential equations ( pde s ) driven by a stochastic term , often referred to as noise .",
    "more precisely , the model may be written @xmath0{\\rm d}t+\\sigma { \\rm d } w,\\\\ { { \\rm d}}v&=&g(u , v){{\\rm d}}t , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] on @xmath1\\times d$ ] , where @xmath2 is a regular bounded open set of @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "this system is completed with boundary and initial conditions .",
    "@xmath5 is a colored gaussian noise source which will be defined more precisely later .",
    "system ( [ eq_model ] ) is degenerate in two ways : there is no spatial operator such as the laplacian neither noise source in the equation on @xmath6 .",
    "all the considered models have the features of classical stochastic pdes for excitable systems . the general structure of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is also typical of excitable dynamics . in particular , in the models that we will consider , the neutral curve @xmath9 for @xmath6 held fixed is cubic in shape . +",
    "to achieve our first aim , that is to numerically compute a solution of system ( [ eq_model ] ) , we work with a numerical scheme based on finite difference discretization in time and finite element method in space . the choice of finite element discretization in space has been directed by two considerations .",
    "the first is that this method fits naturally to a general spatial domain : we want to investigate the behavior of solutions to ( [ eq_model ] ) on domains with various geometry .",
    "the second is that it allows to numerically implement the method with popular software used to simulate deterministic pde s such as the finite elements software freefem++ or equivalent .",
    "the discretization of spde by finite differences in time and finite elements in space has been considered by several authors in theoretical studies , see for example @xcite .",
    "other methods of discretization are considered for example in @xcite .",
    "these methods are based on finite difference discretization in time coupled either to finite difference in space or to the galerkin spectral method , or to the finite element method on the integral formulation of the evolution equation .",
    "we emphasize that we do not consider in this paper a galerkin spectral method or exponential integrator , that is , roughly speaking , we neither use the spectral decomposition of the solution of ( [ eq_model ] ) according to a hilbert basis of @xmath10 ( or another hilbert space related to @xmath2 ) nor the semigroup attached to the linear operator ( the laplacian in ( [ eq_model ] ) ) , in order to build our scheme .",
    "we only use the variational formulation of the problem in order to fit to commonly used finite elements method for deterministic pde s , see @xcite . moreover , the present paper is more oriented toward numerical applications than the above cited papers , in the spirit of @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the author numerically analyzes the effect of noise on excitable systems thanks to a galerkin spectral method of discretization on the square . in the present paper",
    ", we pursue the same objective using the finite element method instead of the galerkin spectral one .",
    "we believe that the finite element method is easier to adapt to various spatial domains .",
    "let us notice that a discretization scheme for spde s driven by white noise for spatial domains of dimension greater or equal to 2 may lead to non trivial phenomena , see @xcite .",
    "considering colored noises may also be seen as a way to circumvent these difficulties . + as is well known",
    ", one can consider two types of errors related to a numerical scheme for stochastic evolution equations : the strong error and the weak error .",
    "the strong error for the discretization that we consider has been analyzed for one dimensional spatial domains ( line segments ) in @xcite . the weak error for more general spatial domains , of dimension 2 or 3 for example , has been considered in @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we recall results about the strong error of convergence of the scheme because we want to numerically investigate pathwise properties of the model . working with spatial domains of dimension @xmath11 ,",
    "as obtained in @xcite , the strong order of convergence of the considered method for a class of linear stochastic equations is twice less than the weak order obtained in @xcite .",
    "this is what is expected since this same duality between weak and strong order holds for the discretization of finite dimensional stochastic differential equations ( sde s ) .",
    "+ our motivation for considering systems such as ( [ eq_model ] ) comes from biological considerations . in the cardiac muscle",
    ", tachyarrhythmia is a disturbance of the heart rhythm in which the heart rate is abnormally increased .",
    "this is a major trouble of the cardiac rhythm since it may lead to rapid loss of consciousness and to death .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the vast majority of tachyarrhythmia are perpetuated by a reentrant mechanism .",
    "in several studies , it has been observed that deterministic excitable systems of type ( [ eq_model ] ) are able to generate sustained reentrant patterns such as spiral or meander , see for example @xcite .",
    "we show numerically that reentrant patterns may be generated and perpetuated only by the presence of noise .",
    "we perform the simulations on the barkley model whose deterministic version has been intensively studied in @xcite and the model of mitchell - schaeffer which allows to get more realistic shape for the action potential in cardiac cells @xcite . for barkley model ,",
    "similar experiments are presented in @xcite where galerkin spectral method is used as simulation scheme on a square domain . in our simulations ,",
    "done on a square with periodic conditions or on a smoothed cardioid , we observe two kinds of reentrant patterns due to noise : the first may be seen as a scroll wave phenomenon whereas the second corresponds to spiral phenomenon .",
    "both phenomena may be regarded as sources of tachyarrhythmia since in both cases , areas of the spatial domain are successively activated by the same wave which re - enters in the region .",
    "+ all the simulations in the present paper have been performed using the freefem++ finite element software , see @xcite .",
    "this software offers the advantage to provide the mesh of the domain , the corresponding finite element basis and to solve linear problems related to the finite element discretization of the model on its own .",
    "one of the originalities of the present work is to use this software to simulate stochastic pde s .",
    "+ let us emphasize that the generic model ( [ eq_model ] ) is endowed with a timescale parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the presence of this parameter is fundamental for the observation of traveling waves in the system : @xmath12 enforces the system to be either quiescent or excited with a sharp transition between the two states .",
    "moreover , the values of the timescale parameter @xmath12 and the strength of the noise @xmath13 appear to be of first importance to obtain reentrant patterns .",
    "this fact is also pointed out by our numerical bifurcation analysis .",
    "let us mention that noise induced phenomena have been studied in @xcite for finite dimensional system of stochastic differential equations .",
    "the theoretical study of slow - fast spdes , through averaging methods , has been considered in @xcite for spdes .",
    "+ in a forthcoming work , we plan to address the effect of noise on deterministic periodic forcing of the barkley and mitchell - schaeffer models .",
    "we expect to observe as in @xcite for the one dimensional case , the annihilation by weak noise of the generation of some waves initiated by deterministic periodic forcing .",
    "we also want to investigate stochastic resonance phenomena in such a situation . on a theoretical point of view",
    ", we intend to derive the strong order of convergence of the discretization method used in the present paper for non - linear equations and systems of equations such as the fitzhugh - nagumo , barkley or mitchell - schaeffer models but also on simplified conductance based models . + the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sect_noise ] , we begin with the definition of the noise source in system ( [ eq_model ] ) and present its finite element discretization . in section [ sect_heat_fhn ] , we introduce a discretization scheme based on finite element method in space for a stochastic heat equation and we recall the estimates from @xcite for the strong order of convergence .",
    "then we apply the method to fitzhugh - nagumo model . in section [ sect_arrhy ] ,",
    "we investigate the influence of noise on barkley and mitchell - schaeffer models .",
    "we show that noise may initiate reentrant patterns which are not observable in the deterministic case .",
    "we also provide numerical bifurcation diagrams between the noise intensity @xmath13 and the time - scale @xmath12 of the models . at last ,",
    "some technical proofs are postponed to the appendix .",
    "let @xmath2 be an open bounded domain of @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 , containing the origin and with polyhedral frontier .",
    "we denote by @xmath10 the set of square integrable measurable functions with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath15 .",
    "writing @xmath18 for @xmath10 , we recall that @xmath18 is a real separable hilbert space and we denote its usual scalar product by @xmath19 and the associated norm by @xmath20 .",
    "they are respectively given by @xmath21 let @xmath14 be a non - negative symmetric trace - class operator on @xmath18 .",
    "let us recall the definition of a @xmath14-wiener process on @xmath18 which can be found in @xcite , section 4.4 , as well as the basic properties of such a process .",
    "let @xmath14 be a non - negative symmetric trace - class operator on @xmath18 .",
    "there exists a probability space @xmath22 on which we can define a stochastic process @xmath23 on @xmath18 such that    * for each @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a @xmath18-valued random variable .",

    "we recall the definition of non - negative symmetric linear operator on @xmath18 admitting a kernel .    a non - negative symmetric linear operator @xmath38 is a linear operator defined on @xmath18 such that @xmath39 let @xmath40 be a real valued integrable function on @xmath41 such that @xmath42 that is @xmath40 is symmetric and non - negative definite on @xmath43 .",
    "we say that @xmath14 has the kernel @xmath40 if @xmath44    let @xmath45 be a non - negative symmetric operator with kernel @xmath40 .",

    "note that the regularity of @xmath48 is important to get the result .",
