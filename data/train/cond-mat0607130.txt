    "the recent experimental realizations of ideally clean quasi one dimensional ( q1d ) systems , like ultra cold fermi gases in elongated harmonic traps @xcite and high mobility quantum wires in the so - called cleaved edge overgrowth samples@xcite , have stimulated a new intense theoretical effort to explain the physical outcome of these systems .",
    "the low dimensionality brings about peculiar phenomena such as the fractionalized ( 0.7 structure ) conductance @xcite , enhances the effect of localization ( wigner crystallization)@xcite , breaks the validity of the fermi - liquid paradigm , which must be abandoned in favor of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) concept@xcite .",
    "one of the most striking consequences of the luttinger theory is the spin - charge separation , which has been seen in a series of remarkable experiments carried out by auslaender _",
    "et al . _ , who were able to resolve the dispersion energy of elementary spin and charge excitations @xcite .",
    "they used the tunneling current between two parallel wires to probe the properties within one of the two wires .",
    "however , their measurements exhibit some features , like fringes in the tunneling pattern and non unitary conductance , that are not completely understood .",
    "the finite - size effects , the disorder and the inhomogeneity of the device can play a crucial role to quantitatively explain the experiments@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will rather focus on the simpler homogeneous q1d electron gas with harmonic transversal confinement and effective interactions with a long range coulomb tail ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the details of the confinement only affect the behavior at short range of the effective potential , and many models@xcite have been proposed which give an equivalent description of the homogeneous q1d coulomb gas . despite its simplicity and a huge amount of theoretical work@xcite done to understand its properties , an accurate parametrization of its correlation energy is still missing . indeed , the calculation of the ground state energy of 1d wires with realistic coulomb interactions is still an open problem , since the tll is an effective low energy theory , and the rpa perturbative expansion is correct only in the high density limit .",
    "recently a mapping of the problem with realistic coulomb interaction onto exactly solvable models has been proposed@xcite , but within this scheme several approximations are required for different density regimes .",
    "previously an stls - like@xcite method was used by calmels and gold@xcite to compute the correlation energy , but it turns out to be not accurate enough to yield the correct ground state in the low density regime .",
    "indeed , it predicts a bloch instability ruled out by the lieb - mattis theorem@xcite .",
    "projection quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques are exact in one dimension , since in this case the ground state ( gs ) nodes are known exactly@xcite , and the so called fixed node approximation , which cures the well known sign problem , does not affect the results",
    ". however , previous diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) simulations@xcite suffered from a lack of ergodicity at low electron densities , when the exchange between electrons become exponentially small .",
    "other qmc attempts@xcite to study the q1d electron gas used the `` world - line '' algorithm on the lattice after a naive discretization of the laplacian . here",
    "we apply the novel lattice regularized diffusion monte carlo ( lrdmc)@xcite , which is more efficient than previous projection qmc methods at low density , where it substantially alleviates the lack of exchanges between electrons .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide a simple and efficient parametrization of the ground state correlation energy , exactly computed for the unpolarized system .",
    "other ground state properties are also studied , like the spin and charge structure factors , which reveal a strong similarity with those computed using a tll with long range interactions@xcite . therefore our parametrization can be an extremely useful input of density functional theory ( dft ) calculations of q1d systems with local density approximation ( lda ) , which can include the homogeneous q1d electron gas with realistic long range interactions and tll features as the reference system .",
    "previous successful attempts have been limited so far to model systems such as the luttinger liquid@xcite or the one dimensional hubbard model@xcite , that have been successfully used as the reference systems for dft simulations of q1d ultra cold inhomogeneous atomic gases .",
    "we believe that an essentially exact calculation of the correlation energy , presented in this paper , should open the way for a wide range of relevant realistic applications in the field of q1d systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in chap .",

    "[ conclusions ] . in the end ,",
    "two appendices explain how to compute the rpa correlation energy at high densities , and how to estimate the plasmon excitations from the knowledge of the static structure factor .",
    "in this paper we study a realistic model for a quantum wire with the lateral confinement provided by a harmonic transversal potential @xmath3 , where @xmath0 tunes the strength of the confinement and measures the wire width . here and henceforth we use the effective bohr radius @xmath4 as length unit and the effective rydberg @xmath5 as energy unit , where @xmath6 is the dielectric constant of the semiconducting medium and @xmath7 is the effective mass of the electrons in the semiconductor . the electrons in the wire",
    "interact via a long range coulomb potential .",
    "if the confinement is sufficiently strong , the ground state ( gs ) of this system can be approximated with good accuracy by a wave function with longitudinal and transversal components factorized .",
    "in particular we neglect any contribution from higher subbands of the lateral direction and we take the gs of the two dimensional harmonic oscillator as the transversal part of the total wave function .",
    "this approximation is valid whenever @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the wigner - seitz radius ( @xmath10 is the mean interparticle distance ) , i.e. for sufficiently low electronic density .",

    "we focus on the gs properties of the wire , we work in the sector of vanishing total spin component along the @xmath19 quantization axis , namely @xmath20 .",
    "obviously this choice is not a restriction because the ground state certainly belongs to this sector , regardless of its total spin . on the other hand",
    "the value of the total spin is known from the lieb - mattis theorem and ref .  :",
    "the gs of the one dimensional coulomb gas is always a singlet for _ all _ densities . in order to perform a finite - size scaling analysis of the energy and correlation functions",
    ", we carried out qmc simulations with different number of particles , going from @xmath21 to @xmath22 and with an odd number of particles per each spin so that the degeneracy effects are avoided . with the aim to further reduce the finite - size bias , we considered the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ ham ] with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) and with an infinite number of replicas of the simulation box ( supercell ) .",
    "thus , an electron in a supercell interacts with the other electrons in the supercell , their images , its own images , and the background .",
    "it is then convenient to define an effective interparticle potential , by summing the bare interaction of a particle and its background with a second particle over all its images , to obtain a periodic function : @xmath23 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{l}\\sum_{n\\ne 0}\\tilde{v}_b(g_n)e^{\\imath g_n x}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expression @xmath12 is the length of the simulation box , @xmath24 takes relative integer values and @xmath25 is a reciprocal vector of the 1d bravais lattice with primitive unit cell of length @xmath12 .",
    "since @xmath26 is a long - range potential , we resort to an ewald - like method@xcite to compute the sum in eq .",
    "the short - range part of the potential @xmath27 and its long - range tail are treated in a different fashion , the former being summed in the direct space , the latter in the reciprocal one .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in practice , we have worked with the hamiltonian @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the madelung energy , i.e. , the interaction of a particle with its own images .",
    "we have used a tabulation for the potential @xmath31 . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath32 sum in @xmath33 has been truncated at @xmath34 and a sufficient number of images in @xmath35 has been included , so that the overall error in the tabulation is less than @xmath36 .",
    "the wave function @xmath37 we used in our qmc simulations is of the slater - jastrow type : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a determinant of @xmath40 plane waves with wave vectors occupied up to the fermi momentum @xmath41 .",
    "the jastrow factor contributes significantly to improve the quality of the variational state , since it correlates the particles and tunes the amplitude of @xmath37 .",
    "here we use a two body jastrow factor , which takes into account the electron - electron correlation , without spoiling the translational invariance of the system .",
    "a recent work @xcite on the 1d @xmath42 hubbard model has shown that the long - range behavior of the two body jastrow effectively accounts for the proper description of the metallic and insulating phases of that lattice model .",
    "therefore a good functional form of @xmath43 in eq .",
    "[ wf ] is crucial to obtain the correct physics for a strongly correlated 1d system .    in order to avoid spin contamination@xcite ,",
    "the function @xmath43 does not depend on the spin of the particles .",
    "in particular , we choose the rpa form of @xmath43 as our first variational ansatz . following ref .  , the fourier components of @xmath44 are : @xmath45 with @xmath46 the structure factor of a non interacting one dimensional electron gas ( 1deg ) .",
    "the two body jastrow is repulsive at the origin , to reduce the probability of two electrons to approach each other , and lower in this way the potential energy .",
    "since the effective coulomb coupling increases as the density decreases , the lower is the density , the higher is the jastrow repulsion .",
    "rescaling @xmath47 is the most straightforward improvement beyond the rpa ansatz .",
    "it improves the variational wave function by means of the simple parametrization @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a linear parameter that we optimized using the variance minimization@xcite .",
    "the optimal values for @xmath49 are reported in tab .  [",
    "scaled ] for different densities and for @xmath50 : the rpa seems good for the highest densities , where @xmath51 , but it becomes worse for lower densities , where the rescaling is effective .",
    "indeed , whenever the correlation is stronger , @xmath47 overestimates the interelectron repulsion .",
    "moreover we have found that the optimal value of @xmath49 does not depend on the number of particles in the supercell , the function @xmath47 having the proper dependence on @xmath11 .    .[scaled ] scaling parameter @xmath49 of the @xmath47 function optimized using the method of variance minimization for the 1deg with @xmath52 and @xmath50 [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the low dimensionality and the strong correlation among the electrons not only have dramatic consequences on the physical properties of the quantum wire , which will be studied in secs .  [ correlation_energy ] and [ pair_correlations ] , but",
    "also affect the efficiency of the qmc simulations of the system .",
    "indeed , as we have seen in the previous section , the effective coulomb interaction leads to an optimal wave function with a strong repulsive jastrow factor , which freezes the relative positions of the particles and enhances the @xmath53 component of the charge - charge correlation , a signature that the system is close to the wigner phase .",
    "the two body jastrow , necessary to provide a good variational description of the system , introduces _ pseudo nodes _ ,",
    "i.e. surfaces in the configuration space where the wave function almost vanishes , due to the exponentially increase of @xmath54 , which acts like a gutzwiller projector , by avoiding `` double '' occupancies on a given electronic position @xmath55 .",
    "these _ pseudo nodes _ are similar to the usual nodes of the fermionic wave function , but if the latter arise from the antisymmetrization of the many body state , the former are a consequence of the strong repulsion , which prevents two electrons to come closer and eventually overlap .",
    "the effect of the _ pseudo nodes _ on the qmc simulation is harmful , since in the 1d case they can lead to a slow convergence of the markov chain to the equilibrium distribution . in particular , it can be extremely difficult to connect two configurations with a spin exchange .",
    "however , the charge degrees of freedom are still well reproduced in spite of this lack of ergodicity , as one might infer that the pseudo nodal pockets are equivalent for the charge properties .",
    "instead the expectation values of spin dependent operators are spoiled , if the markov chain is not able to guarantee a sufficient number of spin exchanges during the simulation in a reasonable time .",
    "the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) algorithm can easily overcome the problem , since the proposed move can be forced to flip the spin of an electronic configuration , either by explicitly introducing a spin exchange or by allowing the amplitude of the move to be greater than the mean interparticle distance .",
    "instead in the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) approach , the random walk has to follow the diffusion process driven by the imaginary time dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "if the importance sampling is introduced , the resulting green function , approximated by means of the trotter expansion up to the first order in the time step @xmath56 , includes the drift - diffusion dynamics : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the quantum force , @xmath59 is the diffusion coefficient , and @xmath60 is a gaussian distributed random variable .",
    "the configurations generated step by step are distributed accordingly to @xmath61 at the beginning of the simulation , but after a transient they will reach the equilibrium and sample the mixed distribution @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the lowest variational state with the same nodes as the trial wave function @xmath37 ( this is the so called fixed node ( fn ) constraint ) . in order",
    "to get rid of the time step bias in the final result , one needs to extrapolate the fn energies obtained at different time steps for @xmath56 going to zero . for smaller @xmath56 ,",
    "spin exchanges become rarer , because the mean square displacement vanishes linearly with @xmath56 ( eq .  [ displacement ] ) . to overcome the lack of spin exchanges in the dmc",
    ", we have applied a different projection qmc method , the lattice regularized green function monte carlo ( lrdmc ) , successfully introduced in ref .   to cure the localization error in the presence of non local potentials . in this section",
    "we review the method and compare its efficiency of sampling spin flips with respect to the standard dmc framework .    the main idea behind the lrdmc method is to deal with a regularized hamiltonian in such a way that the standard green function monte carlo ( gfmc ) algorithm@xcite on a lattice can be applied also to continuous systems .",
    "the regularization of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ ham ] involves both the kinetic and the potential parts .",
    "the laplacian is discretized by means of the finite differences @xmath64 + o(a^2 ) , \\label{kinetic}\\ ] ] with @xmath65 an hermitian lattice operator given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the mesh size , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are constants ( @xmath70 ) , and @xmath71 is the position of the @xmath72-th electron . due to the homogeneity of the system , @xmath68 is kept spatially independent , contrary to the general case@xcite where the dependence of @xmath68 on the electronic positions is exploited to improve the efficiency of the diffusion process . here",
    "@xmath73 , and the contributions to the total laplacian coming from @xmath65 and @xmath74 are equally weighted .",
    "the two terms , with @xmath75 , allow the diffusion to explore all the continuous space , since the two meshes are incommensurate ; in this way the lattice space bias due to the discretization of the continuous kinetic operator is greatly reduced and one can work with a reasonably large value of @xmath67 without a significant lattice step error .",
    "also the potential is regularized , so that our final hamiltonian @xmath76 fulfills the following three conditions : i ) @xmath77 for @xmath78 ; ii ) for the chosen trial wave function @xmath37 , for any @xmath67 and any configuration @xmath55 , the local energy @xmath79)= {   h \\psi_t ( { \\bf r } \\over \\psi_t   ( { \\bf r}}$ ] of the continuous hamiltonian @xmath80 is equal to the one @xmath81})$ ] corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath76 ; iii ) the discretized kinetic energy is equal to the continuous one calculated on the state @xmath37 . the condition ( iii ) determines the constant @xmath69 , while the condition ( ii ) fixes the form of the regularized potential @xmath82 : @xmath83({\\bf r}).\\ ] ] notice that the condition ( ii ) yields another important property for @xmath76 : if @xmath37 is an eigenstate of @xmath80 , it is also an eigenstate of @xmath76 for any @xmath67 .",
    "thus , as the quality of @xmath37 increases , the dependence of the lrdmc energy on @xmath67 decreases .",
    "the lattice regularized hamiltonian @xmath76 reads : @xmath84 where @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) is a @xmath11 dimensional vector defined as the _ one _ particle displacement of length @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "thus there are @xmath89 different @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , and @xmath76 in eq .",
    "[ h_discretized ] contains @xmath90 off diagonal elements , which come from the discretization of the laplacian ( eq .  [ kinetic ] ) .",
    "in particular , by defining the importance sampling green function , @xmath91 , the configuration @xmath92 is connected by @xmath93 to a _",
    "finite _ number of configurations @xmath94 , although @xmath92 and @xmath94 live in a continuous space .",
    "therefore the green function @xmath93 is _ discrete _ , and can be sampled using a heat bath algorithm , like in the standard gfmc scheme on a lattice , although in this case @xmath92 and @xmath94 are continuous variables .",
    "another important difference with respect to the lattice case is the spectrum of @xmath76 , which is unbounded from above ; thus , in order to guarantee the positivity of the green function , we need to perform the limit @xmath95 , which can be handled within the continuous time formulation , already introduced in ref .   for the gfmc method",
    "although in the continuous limit @xmath96 there is no sign problem because the sampling is restricted within a region -the nodal pocket- with definite sign , for non zero @xmath67 the fermionic sign problem is still present and needs to be treated by means of an effective hamiltonian @xcite , which approximates the regularized @xmath76 ( fn constraint ) .",
    "the regularized effective hamiltonian @xmath97 included in the lrdmc algorithm is defined as follows : @xmath98 where @xmath99 , the so called sign - flip term , is the sum over all the terms that cause a negative sign problem in the monte carlo sampling . for this reason",
    "these terms are traced in the diagonal part of the effective hamiltonian , that therefore no longer contains off diagonal terms with the  wrong",
    "the ground state @xmath63 of @xmath97 has the same signs as the trial wave function @xmath37 , and so the mixed distribution @xmath62 sampled during the lrdmc simulation will be non negative . in general , in the limit @xmath100",
    "the fn energy @xmath101 of the effective hamiltonian @xmath97 is an upper bound of the gs energy @xmath102 of @xmath80 .",
    "the fn approximation turns out to be exact only if the nodes of the trial wave function are the same as the gs nodes .",
    "however , the trial wave function @xmath37 in eq .",
    "[ wf ] has the exact gs nodes . indeed in the 1d case the nodal structure of the gs is exactly defined by the coalescence planes @xmath103 , where @xmath71 and @xmath104 are two electrons with the same spin , and the position of the planes are completely determined by the antisymmetry of the particles @xcite . therefore both the lrdmc ( @xmath100 ) and dmc ( @xmath105 ) values for this 1d system are exact within their statistical precision .",
    "we did an accurate comparison between the dmc and lrdmc approaches , by taking into account the efficiency of the energy estimate , the dependence on the time step and on the lattice space , and the spin flip frequency during the simulations , defined as the number of exchanges between two particles with opposite spin per unit time ( imaginary projection time ) per particle .",
    "the `` standard '' dmc algorithm , taken as the reference for our comparison , is described in ref .  .",
    "we applied the two qmc schemes to the quantum wire model with @xmath50 and for @xmath9 ranging from @xmath106 to @xmath107 .",
    "for a fair comparison , we chose the dmc time step @xmath108 , so that both algorithms provide the same amplitude for the diffusion move .",
    "the efficiency of the dmc energy estimate is double that of the lrdmc , since in the latter approach we need to compute in advance all the possible off diagonal moves , thus losing a fraction of the computing time . on the other hand ,",
    "as reported in table  [ exchange ] , the spin exchange frequency is almost the same for the high density model , when the correlation is weak , but the lrdmc becomes more and more effective in sampling the spin flips when the density is lower and the correlation becomes stronger .",
    "in particular , for the lowest density ( @xmath109 ) the lrdmc algorithm yields an efficiency in the spin flip sampling which is two orders of magnitude higher than the dmc case .",

    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ error_qw ] , the lrdmc energies have a quadratic dependence on @xmath67 with a prefactor much smaller than the slope of the linear fit for the corresponding dmc energies .",
    "this means that in order to obtain an almost converged lrdmc result one does not need to go to small lattice spaces , with a gain both from the computational point of view and from the efficiency in the spin flip sampling , which of course is reduced as the diffusion move goes to zero .    , @xmath110,@xmath50 ) .",
    "the lattice space @xmath67 has been mapped into the time step , by means of the relation @xmath111 . for both the two cases",
    ", the dependence appears to be linear , with a slope of 0.117(8 ) for the dmc algorithm and -0.018(2 ) for the lrdmc approach . ]    to summarize , it is apparent that both the lattice step bias and the lack of ergodicity are greatly reduced by using the lrdmc algorithm in the place of the standard dmc .",
    "therefore , given the amplitude of the qmc move , the lrdmc is more effective than the dmc scheme .",
    "we believe that the reason is related to the trotter approximation behind the dmc propagator , which spoils the exact dynamics of the diffusion process and apparently affects the ergodicity of the random walk . on the other hand , even within a finite lattice space , the lrdmc algorithm converges to the exact gs of the effective hamiltonian @xmath97 in eq .",
    "[ effective_fn_hamiltonian ] , implying that simulations are always physically meaningful even for @xmath112 .",

    "the unpolarized hf energy of this quantum wire model is @xmath119 where the first term is the kinetic energy , and the second contribution is the exchange energy ( @xmath120 ) term with @xmath121 and the function @xmath122 defined by @xmath123.\\ ] ] the hartree term vanishes since the system is neutral and homogeneous .",
    "we evaluated the gs energy @xmath102 using the lrdmc method with the fn approximation , which projects the initial @xmath37 to the lowest energy state of the system with the same nodes of @xmath37 .",
    "however , since the trial wave function in eq .",
    "[ wf ] has the exact gs nodes , our lrdmc energies are exact within their statistical precision in the limit @xmath78 , as already pointed out in sec .",
    "[ lrdmc ] .",
    "the correlation energy is then obtained by subtracting the @xmath124 energy of eq .",
    "[ hf_energy ] from the gs energy .",
    "thus , the correlation energy is computed exactly for a given value of @xmath9 and @xmath0 .",
    "it is useful to study the correlation energy in the high and low density limits , in order to find a good parametrization which includes the correct asymptotic behavior . in the high density limit ,",
    "i.e. @xmath125 , the correlation energy can be computed via a perturbative expansion of the interaction , using the rpa technique to find the coefficient of the lowest order term in @xmath9 ( see appendix [ appendix_rpa ] ) .",

    "for instance , in ref .",
    "the correlation was computed using a three - sum - rule approach ( 3sra ) of the stls theory for the same model , and this ratio turned out to be @xmath131 since the asymptotic expansion of @xmath132 in the limit of @xmath128 is@xcite @xmath133 it is possible to obtain an asymptotic estimate also for @xmath134 .",
    "one can perform the same comparison using the lrdmc data . in fig.[exchange_corr ]",

    "[ asympt_corr ] , the slowest decaying contribution to @xmath130 should be @xmath140 , which has been included in the fit .",
    "therefore an accurate extrapolation to @xmath128 is very difficult , since the logarithmic correction in the low density regime is extremely slow , and in order to have a reliable estimate of @xmath141 , one should compute the correlation energy at much higher values of @xmath9 .",
    "for instance , in the 3sra - stls theory@xcite , the ratio @xmath130 converges to the value in eq .",

    "thus also our data seem to support the idea that the correlation energy in quasi - one dimensional systems behaves as @xmath148 or at least this behavior is compatible with our data until @xmath144 .     plotted versus @xmath9 in the low density regime for various thickness @xmath0 .",
