    "recently there has been increasing interest in the use of entangled continuous variable systems in quantum communication @xcite .",
    "the most prominent example is the two - mode squeezed vacuum which in the fock basis reads as @xmath3 [ @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 , @xmath7 real ] and whose wigner function is a gaussian .",
    "when transmitted through a noisy channel , such as optical fibers of given extinction coefficients , the resulting state will in general be mixed . for further use of the state in some quantum communication experiment the question of the entanglement that is available after the transmission arises .",
    "real entanglement measures , however , are difficult to compute and are mostly known only numerically .",
    "a typical example is the entanglement measure based on the relative entropy where the distance of the density matrix of the state under consideration to the set of all separable density matrices must be computed @xcite . in practice",
    ", this becomes impossible for states like a two - mode squeezed vacuum with reasonable strength of squeezing , because for comparable numerical accuracy the hilbert space can only be truncated at higher dimension with increasing squeezing strength .",

    ", we first present the basic formulas for determining the output quantum state from the input quantum state and the characteristic transmission and absorption matrices of the devices ( sec .  [ state ] ) .",
    "we then apply the input - output formalism to the calculation of the output wigner function observed when two modes that are initially prepared in a squeezed vacuum are transmitted through absorbing fibers . using the peres - horodecki separability criterion for gaussian states @xcite",

    "let us first consider the quantum - optical input - output relations and the corresponding quantum - state transformation formulas for light at dispersing and absorbing dielectric four - port devices .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a quasi one - dimensional scheme , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ slab ] , in which the dielectric device is surrounded by vacuum . applying the formalism developed in @xcite ,",
    "we quantize the electromagnetic field in the presence of the device by means of a green function representation of the field and introduction of bosonic fields playing the role of the collective excitations of the field , the dielectric matter , and the reservoir .",
    "it turns out that outside the device the usual mode expansion applies , with the @xmath8 and @xmath9 in fig .",

    "the @xmath11 in the figure are the bosonic operators of the device excitations and play the role of noise forces associated which absorption .",
    "it then follows that the action of the dielectric device on the incoming radiation can be described by quantum optical input - output relations which , in fact , are nothing but a suitable rewriting of the corresponding one - dimensional green function .",
    "let us introduce the compact two - vector notation @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 for the field and device operators respectively .",
    "the input - output relations can then be written in the compact form @xcite @xmath15 where the characteristic transmission and absorption matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , satisfy the energy - conservation relation @xmath18 equations  ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) are valid for any frequency .",
    "they allows us to construct the output operators from the input operators over the whole frequency range .",
    "the second step in the quantum - state transformation corresponds to an open - systems approach .",
    "suppose the incoming field is prepared in some state of the hilbert space @xmath19 and the device ( including the reservoir ) is initially prepared in some state of the hilbert space @xmath20 .",
    "in the full hilbert space , which is the tensor product @xmath21 , a unitary operator transformation can then be constructed , whereas in the space @xmath19 it could not due to the dissipation processes .",
    "let us define the four - vector operators @xmath22 where @xmath23 is some auxiliary ( two - vector ) bosonic device operator .",
    "then , the input - output relation ( [ 1.1 ] ) can be extended to a four - dimensional transformation @xmath24 with @xmath25 @xmath26 su(4 ) @xcite .",

    "let us briefly comment on amplifying devices .",
    "in contrast to absorbing devices , we have now to insert the noise _ creation _ operators @xmath38 into the input - output relation ( [ 1.1 ] ) [ i.e. , @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 .",

    "since strong squeezing ( i.e. , large photon number ) is typically required in quantum teleportation @xcite , one has to find a compromise between highest possible entanglement and lowest entanglement degradation .",
    "we have studied the entanglement degradation of a two - mode squeezed vacuum state transmitted through noisy communication channels , a typical example being the propagation along dispersing and absorbing or amplifying optical fibers . as expected , both absorption and amplification lead to entanglement degradation , because of the additional noise introduced by them . using the quantum - optical input - output relations of radiation at dielectric four - port devices , we have derived the maximal transmission length after which an initially entangled state becomes separable .",
    "analogously , we have found that there is a maximal gain factor for which inseparability ( of any two - mode squeezed vacuum state ) can be retained at all .",
    "knowledge of the complete quantum state at the output of the device enables us , in principle , to compute the amount of entanglement available after transmission such as the distance of the state to the set of all separable states .",
    "however , for higher - dimensional hilbert spaces as in our case this is impossible to do in general .",
    "therefore we have restricted ourselves to the calculation of upper bounds or estimates of upper bounds . for weak",
    "squeezing we may truncate the hilbert space effectively at low photon numbers providing us with a way to establish an upper bound on the entanglement by exploiting the convexity property of entanglement measures .",
    "the procedure is based on the extraction of a single pure state from the output state leaving behind only separable states . for the general case of infinite dimensional hilbert space",
    "we have derived an estimate of the upper bound .",
    "still , we are left with ( estimates ) of bounds on the entanglement .",
    "future works must surely contain algorithms for computation of the entanglement , at least for gaussian states .",
