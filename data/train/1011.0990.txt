    "in hierarchical models of structure formation , dwarf galaxies are the ` building blocks ' of the more massive galaxies .",
    "moreover , the vulnerable nature of these galaxies , which are most abundant in the universe , makes them an excellent probe for exploring the impact of the environment on evolution of galaxies .",
    "a reliable census of dwarfs , and detailed knowledge of their properties is required , over a wide range of epochs , to understand the coeval evolution of the large - scale structure and the galaxies therein .    however , unlike their giant counterparts , dwarfs have received little attention in the literature , possibly due to the challenges encountered in observing these faint and low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , studies conducted in the last decade or so have been able to exploit the multiplex gain of wide - field multi - fibre spectrographs @xcite , while others have targeted the low - luminosity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and low surface brightness @xcite galaxy population in nearby clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    large samples of dwarf galaxies have now been exploited to show that passive dwarfs are found only in very dense environments , or accompanying a more massive companion @xcite .",
    "studies of hi gas content in dwarf galaxies do not find any correlation between the hi gas surface density and star formation rate @xcite or star formation efficiency @xcite , suggesting that dwarf galaxies are star - forming everywhere . using hi surface density normalized by stellar mass to quantify star formation efficiency ,",
    "@xcite suggest that mass dependent quenching mechanism(s ) are likely to play a dominant role in galaxy evolution .",
    "these results imply that transformations in the observable properties of dwarf galaxies may occur only in specific environments , and hence galaxy populations in the process of transformation should be confined to such regions . the post - starburst ( or k+a ) galaxies are among the best candidates for such transitional populations .",
    "the k+a galaxies show strong balmer absorption but lack emission lines in their spectra .",
    "such galaxies are mostly found in and around galaxy clusters at @xmath5 @xcite and at higher redshifts ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite for an alternative view ) .",
    "in the coma and abell  2199 supercluster ( @xmath2 ) , dwarf galaxies show a stronger relation between star formation rate and local galaxy density than is found in the more massive galaxies @xcite , while elsewhere @xcite a strong colour - density relation is found in abell 901/902 system ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "clusters and rich groups at intermediate and high redshifts ( @xmath7 ) have more luminous ( @xmath8 ) k+a galaxies , which seem to be missing in rich clusters at @xmath5 @xcite .    in @xcite , we combined the optical photometric and spectroscopic data ( from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 , sdss dr7 ) with the 24@xmath9 m mips observations to study the star - formation and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity in galaxies across one of the nearest ( @xmath10 @xmath11 mpc ) supercluster , namely coma . in this article",
    "we use a subset of data from sdss dr7 to understand the origin of dwarf k+a galaxies , and their evolutionary link to the passive red dwarf galaxies that are observed in abundance in the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe the dataset and definition of different galaxy populations in the following section . in ",
    "[ colour ] and  [ evolution ] we present our analysis , finally discussing the implications of our analysis in  [ discussion ] .",
    "we adopt the concordance cosmology ( @xmath12 ) for calculating the magnitudes and distances .",
    "we note that at the redshift of coma ( z@xmath13 ) , our results are independent of the choice of cosmology .",
    "different techniques give varying estimates for the virial radius of the coma cluster such that @xmath14mpc .",

    ", we will refer to the pair of clusters coma and abell  1367 , along with the associated filament of galaxies , as the coma supercluster .",
    "the optical photometric and spectroscopic data acquired by the sdss dr7 @xcite are used to select the galaxies belonging to the coma supercluster from the sdss spectroscopic galaxy catalogue only , requiring the member galaxies to be within @xmath17ra@xmath18 deg and @xmath19dec@xmath20 deg on the sky , and with a radial velocity within 3,000 km  s@xmath21 of the mean redshift of the coma supercluster .",
    "all our galaxies are brighter than sdss magnitude @xmath22 ( @xmath23m@xmath24 for coma cluster ) , which is the magnitude limit of the sdss spectroscopic catalogue . in order to select the dwarf population by stellar mass",
    ", we define galaxies with @xmath25 as ` dwarfs ' throughout this work since it is relatively extinction free comapared to other sdss bands .",
    "however , we note that for the sample presented here , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 bands are linearly correlated .",
    "this gives us a sample of 3,050 dwarf galaxies which is used in this article .",
    "the k+a galaxies , defined to have @xmath28  of h@xmath3 in absorption and @xmath29  of h@xmath4 in emission , are taken from the catalogue compiled in @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we consider all galaxies with ew(h@xmath4)@xmath30  as star - forming , and any reference to galaxy colour in context of this work refers to the broadband ( @xmath31 ) colour ( see  [ colour ] ) .",
    "in fig .  [ cmr ] , we plot the radial dependence of @xmath32 for all dwarf ( @xmath33 ) galaxies found in and around the coma cluster .",
    "the mean colour of dwarfs changes from 0.3 around 3r@xmath34 away from the centre , to 0.7 in the core of the cluster .",
    "it is also interesting to note that even with dwarfs alone , the red sequence for the coma cluster extends beyond the virial radius , suggesting that the potential well of the cluster effectively contributes to the evolution of all galaxies as far as the cluster periphery .",
    "the k+a galaxies in the vicinity of the coma cluster span a wide range in @xmath32 colour , such that most of the blue k+as lie within r@xmath34 .",
    "the blue colour of some k+as suggests that the star formation in these galaxies has been very rapidly quenched no longer than @xmath0myr ago ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , a gyr should have elapsed since the termination of the last major episode of star formation in the red k+as , allowing for their observed @xmath32 colour .",
    "the k+a dwarfs show a relatively scattered distribution compared to red dwarfs . assuming that some of these galaxies are seen in projection along the line of sight , it is fair to state that the k+as prefer intermediate density regions found in the outer regions and vicinity of rich clusters and groups ( figs .",

    "* for positions of k+a galaxies in the clusters ) , indicating a possible link between the processes contributing to the k+a phase in dwarf galaxies and the depth of the cluster potential .",
    "we use the @xmath35 colour  magnitude diagram to separate red and blue galaxies in the coma supercluster , where , the blue galaxies are defined to have @xmath32 colour one mean absolute deviation ( mad ) below the fitted red sequence . for consistency in this work we fitted this red sequence using dwarf galaxies only .",
    "this red sequence on an average assigns @xmath36mag to a galaxy of @xmath37 mag .",
    "the location of the red and blue dwarf galaxies across the coma supercluster is shown in fig .",
    "the k+a galaxies and galaxy groups found in the nasa extra - galactic database ( ned ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the selection criteria ) are shown explicitly .",
    "the red dwarf galaxies trace the rich structures clusters , groups and the filament , suggesting a stronger star formation - density relation than their blue counterparts .",
    "in the absence of dust , the equivalent width ( ew ) of h@xmath4 is a good indicator of the current star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "intrinsic h@xmath3 absorption is a characteristic feature of a - type stars , which have a lifetime of 11.5 gyr .",
    "hence , a galaxy that experienced a burst of star formation 12 gyr ago is likely to show strong absorption in h@xmath3 .",
    "but star - forming hii regions in galaxies with ongoing starburst can produce enough ionizing radiation to fill - in the h@xmath3 absorption line .    in fig .",
    "[ ha - hd ] we show the distribution of dwarfs in the coma supercluster in the ew(h@xmath4)ew(h@xmath3 ) plane , segregated into four bins of @xmath32 colour .",
    "the four colour bins are such that the both the redder bins contain galaxies belonging to the red sequence . as galaxies become redder towards the cluster core ( figs .",
    "[ cmr ] & [ scl ] ) the narrow ridge formed by blue galaxies having very strong h@xmath4 emission but negligible h@xmath3 absorption vanishes . in dealing with",
    "the spectral features it is important to check whether the two populations seen in this ew(h@xmath4)ew(h@xmath3 ) plane result from measurement uncertainties . in order to do that",
    ", we split the galaxies in each panel into those that have measurement uncertainty according to sdss , @xmath38 of the measured ew for both h@xmath4 and h@xmath3 ( the coloured points in fig .  [ ha - hd ] ) and those that do not ( grey points in fig .  [ ha - hd ] ) .",
    "as expected , as the emission features become weak for the passively evolving red dwarfs , more galaxies inhabit the uncertain zone .",
    "however among the blue , star - forming class , there exists at least two sub - populations , one that of the starburst dwarfs , which line - up in a narrow ridge on the right hand side of the ew(h@xmath4)ew(h@xmath3 ) plane , and the other of normal star - forming and post - starburst galaxies that have significant absorption in h@xmath3 . the latter class of blue dwarfs overlaps with the red ones , showing relatively low ew(h@xmath4 ) and some absorption in h@xmath3 .",
    "although most of these galaxies have continuous star formation histories with a low sfr , a sub - population might have been quenched recently ( @xmath39 gyr old ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as they are assembled into clusters via the large - scale structure @xcite , thus terminating the starburst . from figs .",
    "[ cmr ] and [ scl ] it is also evident that although most of the blue dwarfs within 3r@xmath34 of the cluster centres have low h@xmath4 emission ( @xmath40 ) , such galaxies are found elsewhere in the supercluster as well .",
    "the red dwarfs showing h@xmath3 absorption similar to the blue galaxies could be ( i ) dominated by metal - rich stellar populations @xcite , or ( ii ) transformed large spiral galaxies , whose disks have been removed after they fell into the cluster @xcite , due to the impact of environmental mechanisms such as ram - pressure stripping @xcite , or ( iii ) star - forming dwarf galaxies in the early phases of transformation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we discuss these possibilities further in  [ discussion ] .    in the coma cluster ,",
    "most ( @xmath41 ) of the dwarf galaxies are red ( fig .",
    "[ cmr ] ) and show no h@xmath4 emission ( fig .",
    "[ ha - hd ] ) , while the same fraction is only @xmath42 in the neighbouring abell  1367 cluster .",
    "given that a significant fraction of blue galaxies with more than @xmath43  of absorption in h@xmath3 , also have @xmath44  of emission in h@xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ ha - hd ] ) , it is likely that star formation in some of them was abruptly quenched .",
    "in this work we attempt to understand the origin of k+a galaxies , and the possible evolutionary link between this transitional population and the red dwarfs found abundantly in the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "we use the publicly available sdss dr7 data for the entire supercluster , with a view to studying the influence of large - scale structure , if any , on the evolution of the k+a galaxies in the low redshift universe . in agreement with other studies of cluster dwarfs in the nearby universe @xcite , we find that the k+a galaxies prefer the intermediate density regions in the vicinity of rich structures .",
    "general studies of k+a galaxies at z@xmath45 also reveal that they preferentially avoid very low and high density regions @xcite .",
    "if star formation in a galaxy is truncated by some mechanism affecting the halo gas , star formation is quenched on long time scales of @xmath46 gyr @xcite .",
    "however if the star formation is suddenly quenched , for instance when a galaxy encounters the cluster environment and is stripped not only of the reservoir of gas but also the supply for ongoing star formation , the sfr declines on much shorter timescales of @xmath47 myr .",
    "thus one is more likely to observe the transient populations , such as the blue passive galaxies @xcite and k+a glaxies in the latter scenario .",
    "this is also consistent with the idea that an infalling galaxy can lose most of its gas in a starburst or violent encounters with fellow infalling galaxies on the cluster periphery ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and subsequently evolve in a passive fashion as it settles into the cluster core , on a timescale equivalent to a few times the cluster crossing time ( @xmath46 gyr ) .    for the dwarf galaxies falling into clusters and groups in the coma supercluster , the velocity field varies significantly depending upon the depth of the potential well they are approaching .",
    "hence , it is likely that the galaxies falling into deeper potentials undergo a burst of star formation in which they either exhaust all the gas content , and/or lose it through interactions with the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , thus experiencing a sudden and rapid cessation in star formation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see fig",
    ".  [ image ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "galaxies falling into relatively shallower potentials are likely to suffer slow quenching .",
    "this explains the presence of dwarf k+a galaxies mostly in the vicinity of the two rich clusters , coma and abell  1367 , and occasionally in galaxy groups embedded in the filament crossing them ( fig .",
    "[ scl ] ) .    in the coma supercluster",
    "we find that around 86% ( 78% ) of all the k+a dwarfs are found within 10 ( 5 ) @xmath11 mpc of the centre of the clusters , suggesting a close link between the transitional k+a population and the cluster environment .",
    "consistent with previous results @xcite , we find that most of the blue k+a dwarfs in the vicinity of the coma cluster are found within its virial radius .",
    "the blue colour of some k+as suggests that the star formation in these galaxies has been quenched rapidly within the last @xmath0myr .",
    "these observations are similar to those made for the comparable virgo cluster .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of dwarf ( @xmath48 m@xmath49 ) galaxies in virgo by comparing their uv to radio spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to multi - zone chemospectrophotometric models .",
    "their results suggest that not only is the star formation in the dwarf galaxies entering the virgo cluster quenched on short ( @xmath50 myr ) time - scales , most of the luminous late - type spirals might also be transformed to relatively massive des in a similar fashion .    in fig .",
    "[ radial ] we find evidence to support a similar scenario in the coma cluster . while the fraction of red dwarfs steadily increases from 4 @xmath11 mpc ( @xmath15r@xmath34 ) to the centre of the cluster , the population of blue dwarfs declines steadily within the virial radius .",
    "the distribution of k+a dwarf galaxies follows the red dwarfs .",
    "since the k+a phase is relatively short - lived ( @xmath51 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in a galaxy s lifetime , the observation of even a small fraction of such a transitional population suggests that a much larger proportion of all galaxies in the region may have passed through this stage .",
    "stellar population synthesis models suggest that galaxies with k+a spectral features ( strong balmer absorption and lack of emission ) are best modelled as a post - starburst ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , i.e. star formation is completely ceased following a burst .",
    "studies of large - scale inter - cluster filaments provide statistical evidence to show that galaxies infalling into clusters are likely to undergo a starburst on the outskirts of clusters , before they are assimilated in their cores ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these results imply that bursts of star formation in galaxies falling into clusters are inevitable consequences of the hierarchical assembly of structures .",
    "this is mainly dependent on two factors : ( i ) the gas content of the infalling galaxies , and ( ii ) the velocity field around the cluster @xcite .",
    "this scenario is further supported by the sdss based study of k+a galaxies by @xcite , who find that the @xmath52 colours and the h@xmath3 ew of k+a galaxies are consistent with models where @xmath53 of the stellar mass of galaxies is formed in a recent starburst .",
    "we find that 7.8% of all dwarf galaxies within 3r@xmath34 of the coma cluster are k+as , while in the relatively smaller abell  1367 this fraction declines to 4.1% within the same aperture .",
    "furthermore , excluding the clusters , the fraction of k+a galaxies in the rest of the supercluster ( fig .",
    "[ scl ] ) is only 1.4% .",
    "the wide range of ages ( @xmath54 gyr ) and metallicities ( @xmath55\\!\\lesssim\\!0.0 $ ] ) in the coma cluster dwarfs suggests non - unique evolutionary histories for these galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "while some of the oldest red dwarfs , confined to the cluster core , may belong to the primordial cluster population @xcite , others could have transformed from luminous late - type spirals , after their infall into the cluster ( fig .",
    "[ image ] ; also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the surface brightness profiles of dwarf ( @xmath56 ) galaxies in the coma cluster also show that while the galaxies fitted with a single srsic profile ( des ) could come from star - forming dwarfs , the dwarf lenticulars ( fitted with srsic@xmath57exponential profile ) are evolved spirals that were harassed during infall ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see porter et al .",
    "2008 ) .    figs .",
    "[ scl ] and [ ha - hd ] provide further clues to the evolution path adopted by dwarfs . while some blue galaxies show ongoing starburst ( right - hand ridge in fig .",
    "[ ha - hd ] ) , star formation in others , especially those falling into clusters , must be suddenly quenched ( figs .",
    "[ scl ] and [ radial ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the red galaxies trace the high density regions , suggesting a relatively stronger star formation - density relation throughout the supercluster ( fig .",
    "[ cmr ] & [ scl ] ) .",
    "the range of values of various relevant measured parameters , explored in this article for the dwarf galaxies in the coma supercluster do not allow us to sub - divide our sample into galaxies with widely different evolutionary histories . instead ,",
    "by considering all dwarfs in coma as a single ensemble , we have been able to provide some insight into the complex mix of star formation histories among this vulnerable population .",
    "it is interesting to note that contrary to the results presented in this article , @xcite find that the giant k+a galaxies ( @xmath58 ) show an environmental dependence similar to that of blue galaxies . in a study of @xmath59 galaxies in a cluster at z@xmath600.54 , @xcite found only 6 post - starburst galaxies amongst the spectroscopic cluster members , thus suggesting that the transformation of star - forming infalling galaxies to the faint red ones found in the low redshift clusters must have occurred primarily through physical processes that do not lead to a post - starburst phase . in order to establish and understand the mass dependence in the occurrence and nature of k+a galaxies , a homogeneous analysis of the spectroscopic properties of galaxies spanning a wide range of @xmath61",

    "we intend to return to this in future .",
