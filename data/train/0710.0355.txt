    "the majority of low - mass main - sequence stars seem to be grouped in multiple systems preferentially binary ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 , fischer & marcy 1992 ) .",
    "these systems have attracted more attention since the discovery that many t - tauri and other pre - main - sequence binary stars possess both circumstellar and circumbinary discs from observations of excess radiation at infrared to millimeter waves and direct images in radio ( rodrguez 1998 ; for a review see mathieu 1994 , 2000 ) .",
    "the improvement in the observational techniques allows , on the other hand , the testing of theories on these objects .",
    "moreover , extrasolar planets have been found to orbit stars with a stellar companion , e.g. , 16 cygni b , @xmath0 bootis , and 55 @xmath1 cancri ( butler 1997 ; cochran et al .",
    "all these facts make the study of stellar discs in binary systems , as well as the possibility of stable orbits on them that could be populated by gas or particles , a key element for better understanding stellar and planetary formation .",
    "in particular the study of simple periodic orbits of a test particle in the restricted three - body problem results a very good approximation to the streamlines in an accretion disc in a very small pressure and viscosity regime , or for proto - planetary systems and its debris ( kuiper belt objects ) .",
    "extensive theoretical work has been done in this direction ( lubow & shu 1975 ; paczyski 1977 ; papaloizou & pringle 1977 ; rudak & paczyski 1981 ; bonnell & bastien 1992 , bate 1997 ; bate & bonnell 1997 ) .",
    "several studies are directed to find the most simple and important geometric characteristic of the discs which is the size of both circumstellar and circumbinary discs , going from analytical approximations : eggleton ( 1983 ) , who provides a simple analytical approximation to the roche lobes ; holman & wiegert ( 1999 ) radii in planetary discs ; pichardo , sparke & aguilar ( 2005 , psa05 hereafter ) radii in eccentric binary stars .    based in the approximation studied in classical mechanics to periodic orbits given by moulton ( 1963 ) , we provide in this work a fairly good approximation by calculating the necessary terms , for the case of circular binaries , to periodic orbits .",
    "this formulation gives not only the radii of the circumstellar and circumbinary discs , but gives a good description of any periodic orbit at a given radius for any of the discs , in the form of an analytical approximation . in this manner",
    ", the set of equations we provide can be used to find any periodic orbit or its initial conditions to run it directly in simulations of the three - body restricted problem , or as a good approximation to initial conditions in the eccentric case as well , from the point of view of particle or hydrodynamical simulations , without the need of solving the restricted three body problem numerically .",
    "the low viscosity regime described by the periodic orbits representation , is important in astrophysics since it gives an idea of how bodies would respond only influenced by the effects of the potential exerted by the binaries , and they could permit to link the periodic orbits to physical unknown characteristics of the discs like viscosity that needs to be artificially introduced to hydrodynamical codes .",
    "it also might permit the calculation of physical characteristics like dissipation rates , etc .",
    "studies like these result easier given in the form of approximated analytical expressions , instead of the usual numerical approximations to the periodic orbits since an analytical formulation is much faster to add to any hydrodynamical or particle code that requires the characteristics of a given family of periodic orbits , or simply their initial conditions in a more precise form than assuming keplerian discs until the approximation fails .",
    "the periodic orbits show regions where the orbits are compressed ( or decompressed ) , these regions could trigger density fluctuations maybe able to drive material to form important agglomerations in the discs that , depending on their positions on the disc and the density , could give origin to planets .",
    "an analytical approximation with a given density law for the discs would allow these kind of studies to be much faster and easier .    in section",
    "[ sec : method ] , we show the strategy and equations used to find the approximation to the periodic orbits in circumstellar discs . in section [ sec : orbits2 ] , we present the equations approximating the periodic orbits in circumbinary discs , and an analysis of stability in section [ sec : stability ] .",
    "a comparison of the application of the formulation and numerically calculated periodic orbits is given in section [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in general , orbits around binary systems are calculated by approximate methods .",
    "numerical calculations are the most extended . in this work we are going to use other known method to search for an analytical approximation that will provide us of solutions for any orbit in circumbinary or circumstellar discs of the circular problem .",
    "the method is based on a perturbative analysis . in this case",
    "we choose some terms in the expanded equations of motion , which are relevant to the solution of the problem .",
    "the original equations are approximated with a set of equations that , in many cases , have an analytical solution . comparing with the numerical approach",
    ", this one has the advantage that the expressions are completely analytical and simple .",
    "we compare our calculations with numerical studies in order to pick as many terms in the expansion as we need to obtain the solution .",
    "the method can be used as a way to find a quick answer and for studies in which an analytic expression makes the problem manageable .",
    "the analysis is restricted to the orbital plane , in polar coordinates the equations of motion are given by ,    @xmath2    where the origin of the system is located at the position of the star with mass @xmath3 ( hereafter we call this star @xmath4 ) .",
    "it is important noticing that @xmath4 can represent either the primary or the secondary star .",
    "here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the radial and angular coordinates respectively , and the forces along this directions ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) have the form    @xmath9    with    @xmath10    that represents the perturbing potential ( divided by @xmath11 ) due to the star with mass @xmath12 ( hereafter , star @xmath13 ) .",
    "@xmath14 could be also expressed in terms of the legendre polynomials ( murray & dermott , 1999 ) . here",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are the coordinates of @xmath13 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 locate the particle that is perturbed , @xmath17 .",
    "the non - perturbed state corresponds to the case with @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the non - perturbed orbits are conics around @xmath4 , which are perturbed by the presence of the other mass .",
    "the set of equations ( [ eq : motion ] ) can not be solved analytically , then we expand the perturbation given in equation ( [ eq : disturb_potential ] ) using @xmath19 as a small parameter .",
    "this parameter at some points in an orbit that begins around a resonance is large , so this approach is not valid .",
    "this expansion improves in precision the closer the particle is to @xmath4 .",
    "thus , equations ( [ eq : motion ] ) can be written as ,    @xmath20 , \\nonumber \\\\ r\\ddot{\\psi}+2\\dot{r}\\dot{\\psi } & = & -{gm_{2}\\over 2}{r\\over r^{3 } } \\left[(3\\sin 2(\\psi-\\psi ) ) + { 3\\over 4 } { r\\over r } ( \\sin(\\psi-\\psi)+5\\sin3(\\psi-\\psi))+\\right .",

    "we consider the mass of the discs negligible compared with the mass of the binary system .",
    "thus , the orbit of @xmath13 is given by    @xmath21    where @xmath22 represents the fixed distance between the stars , and @xmath23 is the angular velocity of @xmath13 from the third law of kepler .",
    "at @xmath24 the star is in the reference line , which for a circular orbit can be any radial line that begins on @xmath4 .",
    "the non - perturbed trajectory of the particle @xmath17 , is a keplerian orbit around @xmath4 , in this manner the polar coordinates are expressed ,    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 have the same meaning of its counterpart in equation [ eq : orbit_s2 ] , but relating @xmath17 and @xmath4 .",
    "the perturbed position of the particle @xmath17 can be written ,    @xmath28    @xmath29    where the terms @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the corrections in the trajectory due to the presence of @xmath13 .",
    "we define now the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath0 as follows ,    @xmath33    @xmath34    here @xmath35 is a small parameter for @xmath36 .",
    "this condition is required for the expansion of the equations of motion ( equations [ eq : expanded_eqns ] ) to be useful .",
    "@xmath0 is the angle that locates the particle @xmath17 , measured from the line connecting the stars , for the non - perturbed orbit .",
    "the first step is to replace @xmath37 for @xmath0 in equation ( [ eq : expanded_eqns ] ) , using equation ( [ eq : tau ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ eq : disturbed_r ] and [ eq : disturbed_v ] ) are substituted in equations ( [ eq : expanded_eqns ] ) taking into account that @xmath38 and @xmath31 depend on @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting expressions are finally divided by @xmath39 .",
    "the mass is given in units of @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , then ,    @xmath42 & ,      \\label{eq : motion_rho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath43 &   \\ ; .",

    ". they will be solved for @xmath38 and @xmath31 in terms of @xmath12 ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath0 and @xmath35 .",
    "the value for @xmath12 , characterizes the stellar masses of the system , @xmath0 defines the angular position of the point in the original non - perturbed orbit , and @xmath35 depends on the radial position of the non - perturbed trajectory @xmath26 , in units of the separation between the stars , @xmath22 .",
    "an analytic solution is found if an expansion for @xmath38 and @xmath31 in powers of @xmath35 is made as follows ,    @xmath45    @xmath46    specifically , for periodic orbits , it is necessary to fulfill the next conditions ,    @xmath47    an useful assumption is that the angular position of the orbit , from the line that connects the two stars , is not perturbed by @xmath13 , a fact necessarily true , which can be demonstrated using symmetry arguments .",
    "we restrict the perturbed orbits to be symmetric with respect to the line joining the stars by ,",
    "@xmath48    this condition is general enough since there are no restrictions provided by observations about the orientation of the symmetry axis in the plane of the discs with respect to the line joining the stars .",
    "equations ( [ eq : expansion_rho ] and [ eq : expansion_psip ] ) are substituted in equations ( [ eq : motion_rho ] and [ eq : motion_psip ] ) and expanded in powers of @xmath35 , ending with a polynomial in @xmath35 equal to zero .",
    "the only solution for such an equation is that every coefficient is zero .",
    "each coefficient associated to a given power , is a second order differential equation .",
    "the solutions of the equations for @xmath49 with @xmath50 , are solved imposing the conditions given in equations ( [ eq : periodic_conditions ] and [ eq : condition_tau0 ] ) and are given by    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56    with    @xmath57    it is worth noticing that for each order ( in @xmath58 ) we obtain a system of two differential equations that produce two integration constants that can be calculated by solving the set of equations of the next higher order , by imposing the conditions in equations [ eq : periodic_conditions ] and [ eq : condition_tau0 ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 comes from the approximation @xmath60 , where we will consider @xmath59 constant , justified by the fact that @xmath59 depends weakly on @xmath35 ( moulton 1963 ) .",
    "using equations ( [ eq : rho2 ] , [ eq : psip2 ] , [ eq : rho3 ] , [ eq : psip3 ] , [ eq : rho4 ] and [ eq : psip4 ] ) , plus equations ( [ eq : expansion_rho ] and [ eq : expansion_psip ] ) in equations ( [ eq : disturbed_r ] and [ eq : disturbed_v ] ) will let us find the perturbed trajectory of the particle @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath26 is proportional to @xmath35 , the radial corrections are of order @xmath61 and the angular corrections are of order @xmath62 .",
    "thus , equations ( [ eq : disturbed_r ] and [ eq : disturbed_v ] ) represent coordinates depending on time , which means velocity and accelerations can be obtained by direct differentiation .",
    "it is worth noticing that the orbits are given in the reference system where the stars are fixed in the @xmath63 axis .",
    "an example of the orbits and rotation curves produced by this model are given in section [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "to calculate the total radial size of discs we will assume we are in the regime of low pressure gas .",
    "the permitted orbits for gas to settle down there , are all those that do not intersect themselves or any other ( paczyski 1977 , psa05 ) . in this paper we will use the same approximation to find discs radii except that the intersections are found analytically ( other analytical approximation to the radial extension for circumstellar discs for any eccentricity can be found in psa05 ) .",
    "first , we choose a given @xmath12 , to fix the binary system .",
    "a physical intersection occurs when    @xmath64    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the radius of the orbit given by equation ( [ eq : disturbed_r ] ) and @xmath67 spans the @xmath68-angular - range of the same orbit .",
    "the subindex @xmath69 takes the values @xmath70 for inner and outer consecutive orbits , respectively .",
    "we now look for a value for @xmath26 and @xmath0 that simultaneously satisfy equations ( [ eq : inters_r ] and [ eq : inters_v ] ) .",
    "note that equation ( [ eq : inters_r ] ) can be expanded in a series of taylor in the variable @xmath26 . due to the assumption that we are interested in infinitesimally close orbits , a linear approximation is good enough . in this manner ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : inters_r ] ) can be transformed to    @xmath71    which is a function of @xmath12,@xmath26 and @xmath0 .",
    "also , using equation ( [ eq : disturbed_v ] ) , the equation ( [ eq : inters_v ] ) can be written as    @xmath72    from equations ( [ eq : psip2 ] , [ eq : psip3 ] and [ eq : psip4 ] ) we directly identify that all the terms are proportional to @xmath73 , which results proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "thus , @xmath74 can be factorized in equation ( [ eq : intersec_v ] ) giving the solutions @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : intersec_v ] ) has other solutions but none allows to find a root for equation ( [ eq : intersec_r ] ) . taking ( @xmath77,@xmath78 ) and using any of these options in equation ( [ eq : intersec_r ] ) , we end up with an equation for @xmath26 .",
    "the solution of equation ( [ eq : intersec_r ] ) using @xmath79 gives two values of @xmath26 , which correspond to the intersections .",
    "we take the intersections at the smallest radius ( that represent the maximum radii where gas particles would be able to settle down ) , thus the second intersection at larger radius are not useful in this analysis . in both cases",
    "the intersecting orbits are tangent to each other , and contiguous orbits between them intersect at an angle .",
    "because we do not consider this kind of orbits as part of the disc , the disc naturally ends up in the orbits with smaller @xmath26 .",
    "the minimum value for @xmath26 comes from @xmath78 , this is , the intersection appears at the opposite side of the star @xmath13 . in table",
    "[ table.csdiscs ] , the solution of equation ( [ eq : intersec_r ] ) for different values of @xmath3 , with @xmath78 , is given in the column named @xmath80 .",
    "the following two columns ( @xmath81,@xmath82 ) give the radial positions of the innermost intersecting orbit .",
    "the average of these values is given in the column @xmath83 , the next column gives the same average but from psa05 , and the last column is the approximation to the roche lobe radius by eggleton ( 1983 ) given by ,    @xmath84    where @xmath69 refers to either star @xmath85 with @xmath86 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from table 4 , the trend for @xmath87 is to decrease when the orbit is moving away from the binary system , as expected .",
    "note that @xmath88 is quite small , consequently , this value can be taken as a threshold for instability and the orbit in psa05 will naturally define the boundary between the unstable ( not possible for gas orbits ) and the stable ( possible ) part of the disc .",
    "it is worth noticing that this analysis can be applied either to numerical or analytical orbits .",
    "only the fourier coefficients of a function that depends on the orbit are required .",
    "thus , the stability analysis described here is general , and can be used with any orbit of the restricted circular three - body problem .",
    "in this section we present a simple comparison between the results presented in this work and precise numerical results performed with the usual methods to integrate the motion equations in a circular binary potential .",
    "we show for this purpose two tests , the first is a direct qualitative comparison between numerical and the analytical approximation to some representative discs .",
    "the second including velocities , are the correspondent rotation curves .      the equations of motion of a test particle are solved for the circular restricted three body problem using an adams integrator ( from the nag fortran library ) .",
    "cartesian coordinates are employed , with origin at the center of mass of the binary , in an inertial reference frame . here",
    "we look for the families of circumstellar and circumbinary orbits at a given stellar phase of the stars ( equivalent to look for the families in the non - inertial frame of reference ) .",
    "we calculate the jacobi energy of test particles , in the non - inertial frame of reference co - moving with the stars , as a diagnostic for the quality of the numerical integration , conserved within one part in @xmath89 per binary period .      in the case of binary systems",
    "is well known the shape and extension of discs are different from the single stars case , where the periodic orbits are circles with a radial unlimited ( by the potential of the single star ) extension . in binary systems",
    "the stellar companion exerts forces able to open gaps , limiting the extension of the discs and producing at the same time deformations in the shape of the discs making them visually different from single star cases . in this section",
    "we show a comparison between the discs obtained by the analytical approximation provided in this work , the numerical solution and the keplerian approximation .    to construct the analytical circumstellar discs we show in this section , we have employed the equations [ eq : disturbed_r ] and [ eq : disturbed_v ] that can be written in the inertial reference system ,    @xmath90    @xmath91    with @xmath0 in the interval @xmath92 $ ] .    in the figure [ fig.compeb_mosaico_q0.2 ]",
    ", we show the comparison for circumstellar discs between the approximation presented in this work for periodic orbits in a binary system ( left panels ) and numerical calculations ( right panels ) .",
    "the value for @xmath93 is indicated on the top of the figure .",
    "the darker curve represents the roche lobe .",
    "likewise , in figure [ fig.compeb_mosaico_q0.2_cb ] we show a qualitative comparison of a circumbinary disc between the analytical approximation ( left panels ) and numerical calculations ( right panels ) .",
    "the distance of the stars with respect the center of mass of the binary is shown .",
    "the discs present a slight deformation of the orbits depending on the radius : the outermost orbits are farer from being circles .",
    "the orbits are , a very good approximation , ellipses with an eccentricity depending on the radius to the central star , in the cincumstellar discs , and to the center of mass in the circumbinary discs case .",
    "thus , we have calculated the m=2 fourier mode for all the orbits given by    @xmath94    where the index @xmath69 refers to the number of evenly distributed ( by interpolation ) in angle points in a given loop , and @xmath95 is the total number of points in the loop , @xmath96 is the distance to the point @xmath69 from the center of mass of the binary . in this manner ,",
    "the average inner radius of a circumbinary disk is given in units of the semimajor axis @xmath22 by the coefficient @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "the ellipticity ( @xmath99 ) by @xmath100 with @xmath101 in the same units and transformed first to the ratio @xmath102 , where @xmath103 are the semimajor and semiminor axis of the orbit @xmath69 , and finally transformed to eccentricity ( @xmath104 ) by ,    @xmath105    which represents a more sensitive geometrical characteristic of the orbits than ellipticity .",
    "we have not considered in this comparison higher fourier modes since they are negligible compared to the m=2 mode .    in the figure [ fig.mosaic_ecc ]",
    "we show the eccentricity vs the average radius for a ) the orbits produced by the analytical approximation provided in this work ( continuous lines in the 9 frames ) , b ) the full numerical solution ( open triangles ) , and for reference c ) the keplerian ( @xmath106 ) solution ( dashed lines ) . in this figure",
    "we show three different masses @xmath107 , at left , middle and right panels respectively ( as indicated on the upper frames labels ) .",
    "the upper frames are referred to the circumprimary discs , the middle to the circumsecondary discs , and the lower are the circumbinary discs .",
    "the system of reference for each case is on the respective star for the circumstellar discs and in the center of mass for the circumbinary discs .",
    "we also show here , for a quantitative comparison involving positions and velocities , the rotation curves for binary systems with @xmath108 .    we have constructed the rotation curves by direct differentiation of equations [ eq : disturbed_r ] and [ eq : disturbed_v ] ( or more precisely of equations [ eq : disturbed_r2 ] and [ eq : disturbed_v2 ] ) , to obtain the total velocity ( @xmath109 ) at two different regions of the discs . for the primary discs we compared the rotation curves obtained along the x axis , on the left part of the discs ( where the radial velocities are negative and prograde with the rotation of the binary ) .",
    "for the secondary we chose to compare the rotation curves along the x axis but on the right part of the disc ( where the radial velocities are positive and prograde with the rotation of the binary ) .",
    "once the velocities are calculated , we transformed the results to the inertial frame ( in the circumstellar discs ) by simply adding ( or subtracting depending on the given disc ) the velocity of the correspondent star , and adding or subtracting also a factor @xmath110 , where @xmath23 is the angular velocity of the star and @xmath5 is the radius of a given point in he rotation curve .",
    "the last because of the chosen reference system where this work solves the equations , which anchorages the discs to rotate with the system .    in the figure [ fig.crot_s1 ] and [ fig.crot_s2 ]",
    "we show the outer ( top panels ) and inner ( bottom panels ) regions of the primary and secondary rotation curve discs , respectively . by `` outer '' or `` inner '' regions we mean , in a reference system located in the primary ( or in the secondary ) star , measuring and angle from the line that joins the stars , the inner region corresponds to angle zero from this line , and the outer regions correspond to and angle of @xmath111 .",
    "for both figures we plot the three different cases , @xmath108 .",
    "three different types of lines indicate , a)the keplerian rotation curve on the top ( filled circles ) ; b ) the analytical approximation provided in this work ( continuous line ) ; c ) the numerical solution ( open circles ) .",
    "the velocity and radius are given in code units ( in such a way that @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) .",
    "the rotation curves are in approximately 70@xmath116 of the total radius of the correspondent disc , keplerian curves . for the last 30@xmath116 the keplerian discs velocity are systematically over the numerical result that solves with high precision the restricted three body problem .",
    "the analytical solution we provide here is very close to the numerical solution as expected .    in the figure [ fig.cr_cb ]",
    "we show the rotation curves as in figures [ fig.crot_s1 ] and [ fig.crot_s2 ] , but for the circumbinary disc .",
    "although in this case both approximations ( the one given in this work , and the numerical one ) are very close to a keplerian rotation curve , it is not exactly keplerian .",
    "the velocities in the analytical approximation are sistematically under the keplerian curve and they are practically the same as the ones provided by the numerical solution , until the end ( the beginning of the gap ) where the numerical solution goes slightly over the analytical solution .",
    "we present only one case of mass ratio because other mass ratio would give very similar results .    in the case of the full ( numerical ) solution",
    ", it is worth to notice we obtain in some cases discotinuities on the rotation curves and orbits mainly due to resonances .",
    "this is the case , for instance , in the figure [ fig.cr_cb ] , where we appreciate a discontinuity very close to the resonance 3:1 ( @xmath117 in the figure ) .",
    "the discontinuity is also noticeable in the fig .",

    "we have constructed an analytical set of equations based on perturbative analysis that result simple and precise to approximate the solution for the circular restricted three body problem .",
    "we choose some terms in the expanded equations of motion , which are relevant to the solution of the problem .",
    "the original equations are approximated with a set of equations that , in many cases , have an analytical solution .",
    "we show the goodness of our analytical approximation by direct comparison of geometry and rotation curves with the full numerical solution .",
    "the set of equations we prsent can provide any periodic orbit for a binary system , either circumstellar or circumbinary , and not only the outer edge radius of circumstellar discs or the inner edge radius ( gap ) of the circumbinary disc , without the need to solve the problem numerically .",
    "the relations provided are simple and straightforward in such a way that our approximation can be used for any application where initial conditions of periodic orbits or complete periodic orbits are needed , or for direct study of the three body restricted circular problem .",
    "for instance , in order to introduce on a hydrodynamical or particle code , our initial conditions would result in much more stable discs than with keplerian initial conditions , or than by constructing the discs directly from hydrodynamical simulations of accretion to binaries that will require long times to obtain stable discs . since our approximation is completely analytical it will have the obvious additional advantage of being computationally , extremely cheap , and easier to implement than the numerical solution .",
    "the periodic orbits respond uniquely to the binary potential and do not consider other physical factors such as gas pressure , or viscosity that work to build the fine details of discs structure .",
    "they are however , the backbone of any potential and their shape and behavior give the general discs phase space structure . in this manner , apart of all the possible hydrodynamical or particle discs applications , we can directly use them to study from the general discs geometry to rotation curves , or rarification and compression zones by orbital crowding , etc .",
