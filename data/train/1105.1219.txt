    "the major parameters for studying the structure and dynamics of the galaxy are the galactic constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are the distance of the sun from the galactic center and the circular rotational velocity of the lsr ( local standard of rest ) , respectively .",
    "they are the most fundamental parameters for the rotation curve and mass analyses of the galaxy , and are often assumed to be 8 kpc and 200 ( sofue et al .",
    "2009 ) . however , the currently determined values allow a wide range of uncertainties , diverging from @xmath3 to 9 kpc and @xmath4 to 250 ( reid et al .",
    "1993 , 2009a ; mcmillan and binney 2010 ; olling and merrifield 1998 ; honma and sofue 1997 ) .",
    "there have been various methods to determine @xmath0 and @xmath1 , that include the direct distance measurements of the parallax of sgr a@xmath5 using radio vlbi technique , measurement of the distance to the star forming region sgr b using the statistical parallax method , and the measurement of distance to the center of mass of the distribution of globular clusters from spectroscopic parallax as well as the period - luminosity relation of rr lyr variables ( review by reid et al .",

    "the solar - circle method is a geometrical method to determine @xmath0 , in which an object with known distance and zero lsr velocity is used to solve an isosceles triangle as illustrated in figure [ fig - circ0 ] ( miharas 1981 ) .",
    "it requires no other assumption , except for the circular rotation .",
    "the rotation velocity of the sun @xmath1 is also determined , if the proper motion of the object is measured . however , since the source is required to lie exactly on the solar circle , the method has been rarely applied .",
    "ando et al . ( 2011 ) recently applied this method to the star forming region on2n , which lies exactly on the solar circle with zero lsr radial velocity .    in the present paper , we modify the solar - circle method , which requires sources with lsr radial velocity @xmath6 , to a more practical way , so that a larger number of galactic objects , e.g. with @xmath7 , may be used .",
    "we present formulation of the method and estimates .",
    "the method makes it possible to directly estimate the galactic constants without assuming a rotation curve . in this context",
    ", it may be complimentary to the statistical likelihood method assuming a rotation curve engaged by mcmillan and binney ( 2011 ) .",
    "we also try to apply the method to determine @xmath0 using data from the literature for hii regions with known distances .",
    "if an object is located exactly on the solar circle , its line of sight velocity is zero , @xmath6 , and the galactic constants , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are determined simply by measuring the distance , @xmath10 , and perpendicular velocity in the direction of galactic longitude , @xmath11 as r_0 = r 2 l , [ eqr00 ] and v_0 = -2l .",
    "[ eqv00 ] here , and hereafter , the velocities @xmath12 and @xmath11 are referred to the lsr coordinates after correction for the solar motion .",
    "it is , however , seldom to find an object exactly located on the solar circle with the radial velocity being equal to zero .",
    "we therefore consider using objects which are near the solar circle with finite @xmath12 , and modify the solar circle method for more practical observations .",
    "we consider an object in the galactic plane at galactic longitude @xmath13 at a distance from the sun @xmath10 .",
    "we denote the distance of the object from the solar circle on the line of sight by @xmath14 as illustrated in figure [ fig - circ ] .",
    "then , @xmath10 and @xmath14 are related to the galacto - centric distance @xmath15 and longitude @xmath16 by r = 2 l + d.

    "if the object is near the solar circle , @xmath19 .",
    "this is written using @xmath14 as @xmath20 note that @xmath12 is negative for an object outside the solar circle as shown in figure [ fig - circ ] , for which @xmath14 is positive . here",

    "we now consider a case that the object is not on the solar circle , as usually is the case , but it is located near the circle so that @xmath24 and @xmath25 , e.g. @xmath26 .",
    "we may taylor expand equations [ eq - vr ] and [ eq - vp ] in terms of quantities including @xmath27 and @xmath12 .",
    "we obtain the following explicit expressions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "the above expressions include the oort constant @xmath21 , which includes @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "since the term including @xmath21 is multiplied by @xmath12 , the effect of the uncertainty of @xmath21 is of the second order magnitude .",
    "we adopt the most often used value of @xmath30 . in this context , the present method is not perfectly independent of the current determination of the galactic constants .",
    "however , the effect from the uncertainty of @xmath21 is of the second order smallness , and the errors arising from an error of @xmath21 can be neglected in the present case .",

    "such observations have become recently possible indeed using vera applying the vlbi technique ( honma et al 2007 ) : we are able to determine @xmath10 by parallax measurements , @xmath12 by spectroscopy of maser radio line emissions , and @xmath11 by proper motion measurements .",
    "the errors of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are caused by the observational errors @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 of @xmath10 , @xmath12 , @xmath11 , respectively , as well as by a possible error @xmath35 of the adopted oort constant @xmath21 .",
    "we calculate the propagation of errors in equation [ eq - rsun ] and [ eq - vsun ] , but neglect the second order contributions including terms of the order of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",

    "note also that the error @xmath35 occurring from the uncertainty in @xmath21 appears in the second order terms , and has been neglected .    in figure [ fig - dr0v0 ]",
    "we show examples for the resulting errors in @xmath0 and @xmath1 calculated for a set of given values of errors of the observables as @xmath40 kpc , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "brand and blitz ( 1993 ) compiled data sets of photometric ( spectroscopic ) distances of galactic hii regions / reflection nebulae with measured radial velocities from associated molecular clouds .",
    "their list includes a number of near - solar circle objects , which have sufficiently small radial velocities . considering the error estimates in figure [ fig - dr0v0 ] , we chose sources whose distances are greater than 3 kpc , their radial velocity is small enough with @xmath7 , and galactic longitudes are either @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "also , sources in the galactic center direction at @xmath45 , which are mostly local objects , were omitted .",

    "on1 appears to be too close to the sun ( @xmath53 kpc ) for application of the present method , resulting in unreasonable values , which may also be due to the source s intrinsic motion such as due to random motion and/or streaming motion .",
    "on2n is an exceptional case , for which the strict solar circle method can be applied , as discussed by ando et al ( 2011 ) in detail , and we have confirmed the values .    the present method is based on equations ( [ eq - rsun ] ) and ( [ eq - vsun ] ) , simply applying taylor expansion to the solar circle solutions by equations ( [ eqr00 ] ) and ( [ eqv00 ] ) . hence , the method does not require to assume any model for the rotation curve , except for the local @xmath21 value , which yields uncertainty on the second order of o(@xmath59 ) .",
    "this method may be , therefore , complimentary to the likely food analysis engaged by mcmillan and binney ( 2010 ) , in which a model rotation curve is to be assumed .    finally , we comment on possible intrinsic scatter in the kinematical observables that affect the results .",
    "individual sources may have intrinsic velocity dispersion of @xmath60 several on the same order of that for interstellar matter .",
    "non - circular streaming motions would be also superposed on the circular motion .",
    "these will yield effective velocity dispersion on the order of @xmath61 , and result in the statistical error of the derived @xmath0 values on the order of @xmath62 kpc . to obtain a more precise @xmath0 value ,",
