    "the behavior of particles in confined geometries is important in many different areas of physics and technology .",
    "this includes the physics of ions in electromagnetic traps @xcite , of dusty plasmas confined by external fields @xcite , of classical electrons in quantum wells @xcite and of colloidal suspensions in narrow slits @xcite , as well as application - oriented topics in nanotechnology , ( bio)lubrication and the self - assembly of microstructured materials ( e.g. ref .",
    "it is well - known that confinement effects can dramatically change the behavior of such systems , both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "for instance , when a suspension of colloidal hard spheres is confined in a wedge - shaped geometry , one observes a rich cascade of different equilibrium crystal structures as the wall spacing increases @xcite .",
    "such behavior contrasts sharply with the bulk phase diagram , which consists of a single , density - dependent liquid to face - centered - cubic crystal transition .",
    "the past few decades have seen many studies of the behavior of hard spheres between impenetrable walls ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , of charged particles under strong confinement ( a model for trapped coulombic or yukawa particles , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and of confined dipolar colloids ( e.g. ref .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there have been no studies that systematically investigate the role played by the softness of the confining potential .",
    "this is an important issue to address , as more and more systems become available that involve some form of soft confinement . in the areas of",
    "colloid science and nanotechnology one can for instance think of suspensions confined in dielectrophoretic @xcite or laser - optical fields @xcite , nanometric objects in charged slits @xcite , particles interacting with soft polymer substrates @xcite , or particles trapped at liquid - liquid or liquid - gas interfaces @xcite .",
    "using monte carlo simulations , we here study three - dimensional systems of hard spheres that in one dimension are constrained to a plane by a harmonic potential . unlike hard boundaries ,",
    "this soft potential well does not prescribe a particular confinement ` width ' , can be continuously tuned from very strong to very weak confinement , and makes an energy contribution to the total free energy which depends on the exact particle positions .",
    "we highlight the unique properties imparted by such soft confinement by comparing the observed phase behavior with that of hard spheres between two hard walls @xcite , as well as with the behavior of a more complex system of highly charged particles and their counterions between neutral walls @xcite . in the latter system ,",
    "the particles experience a combination of an effective harmonic potential due to the counterions and long - ranged repulsive coulomb interactions .",
    "we performed grand canonical monte carlo simulations of hard spheres that are constrained to a plane by a harmonic potential .",
    "hard spheres do not interact with each other unless their cores overlap and for any pair of particles the interaction potential is given by : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath2 is the absolute temperature , @xmath3 is the center - to - center distance of the particles and @xmath4 is the particle diameter , which we took as the unit of length in our simulations .",
    "we used periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath5 plane ( box size @xmath6 = @xmath7 20 , unless stated otherwise ) and a soft confining harmonic potential centered around @xmath8 , which acts on each particle individually and whose softness was set through the spring constant @xmath9 ( in units of @xmath10 ) : @xmath11 we performed simulations for different chemical potentials of the reservoir , starting with an empty box . using cell lists and an early rejection scheme @xcite , we typically performed @xmath12 monte carlo moves in which we attempted to insert , delete or displace ( @xmath13 ) a randomly chosen particle , where the fraction of insertion and deletion moves was fixed at 0.2 .",
    "we also performed simulations with an additional move in which the @xmath14 aspect ratio of the box was allowed to change while keeping the area @xmath15 constant . in principle",
    ", this should prevent the box shape from dictating the structure of the particle packing , but in all cases the resulting structures were identical to those observed in a square box .",
    "after thorough equilibration , we determined the number of particles @xmath16 in the simulation box and from this the density , @xmath17 , and characterized the structure of the typically layered particle packings by calculating the four - fold ( @xmath18 ) and six - fold ( @xmath19 ) symmetric two - dimensional bond order parameters in each of the layers @xcite .",
    "the bond - order parameters consider all of the nearest neighbors of a given particle that lie approximately in the same @xmath20 plane . based on geometric arguments and the observed particle distributions along the @xmath20 axis",
    ", the nearest neighbors were here defined as those particles residing within a center - to - center distance @xmath21 of the particle of interest and with a height difference @xmath22 .",
    "this definition excludes second - nearest neighbors , which in a close - packed square - symmetric layer reside at @xmath23 , and is also found to reliably discriminate between thermally broadened and adjacent layers along @xmath20 .",
    "the ratio between the two bond order parameters allowed us to distinguish between the three main types of structures found in our simulations : disordered liquid for @xmath24 , hexagonally ( @xmath25 ) packed for @xmath26 , and square ( @xmath27 ) packed for @xmath28 .",
    "the crossover values were determined from plots of @xmath29 across the entire density range studied in the simulations , as well as the density probability distributions , which revealed the first - order phase transitions .",
    "we find that varying @xmath30 and @xmath31 by @xmath32 does not affect the resulting phase diagram .",

    "[ fig1 ] and the simulation snapshots in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] provide an overview of the observed particle packings as a function of the density and spring constant . at high spring constants ( @xmath37 ) , i.e. relatively strong confinement , and low densities the particles form a layer of disordered liquid ( @xmath38 ) at the minimum of the confining harmonic potential . at higher densities ,",
    "the liquid freezes into one or more crystalline layers which have a hexagonal ( @xmath25 ) or square ( @xmath27 ) symmetry ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , following an alternating sequence as the density increases : @xmath39 ( the integers indicate the number of particle layers that is formed ) . to rationalize these observations",
    ", we consider the limit @xmath36 ( or @xmath40 ) in which the entropic contribution to the free energy can be neglected and the energy contribution of the confining potential dominates : @xmath41 , where the sum runs over all the particles in the system . simple geometry then gives the energies of the perfect hexagonal and square packed structures , which scale linearly with the density because of the quadratic form of the confining potential , fig .",
    "the maximum density of each of the phases corresponds to close packing , e.g. @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "starting at low density , the @xmath46 transition is given by the two - dimensional hard disk freezing transition @xcite and the @xmath47 phase ( strongly constrained to @xmath48 and with negligible energy ) is stable until close packing at @xmath49 . instead of continuously transforming into a 3@xmath25 structure , the system then phase separates into 1@xmath25 and 2@xmath27 .",
    "this phase separation can be understood in terms of a free energy minimization criterion , equivalent to the double - tangent construction .",
    "a similar argument applies to the subsequent transitions @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and so on . around 7 layers",
    "the square symmetric structures eventually disappear , in favor of the denser hexagonal packings , which have a face - centered cubic ( fcc ) , hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) or a random hexagonal close packed ( rhcp ) structure , similar to the crystalline bulk phases of hard spheres .",
    "the sequence of alternating hexagonal and square packings under strong harmonic confinement corresponds to the simple pieranski picture of hard spheres confined between two hard walls @xcite .",
    "however , we do not see any of the buckled , rhombic and prism phases that are found to interpolate between these packings under hard - confinement conditions , when entropy solely determines the phase behavior @xcite . by contrast , at high spring constants the behavior of the harmonically confined system is energy - dominated and the usual intervening phases are found to be unstable , because the second derivative of the ( free ) energy with respect to the density is negative .",
    "furthermore , the intervening phases also appear to be unstable at finite spring constants , as we always observed a spontaneous melting ( low spring constants ) or phase separation ( higher spring constants ) of the system when it was initially prepared in one of these phases . in the absence of any stable intervening phases at higher spring constants , the coexistence regions between the stable hexagonal and square packed phases  which can only exist with low free energy at certain densities due to the integer number of layers  are wider than under hard - confinement conditions ( note , by the way , that in order to approach the hard - confinement limit one would need to increase the exponent of the confining potential , rather than the pre - factor ) .",
    "we point out that the alternating hexagonal and square - symmetric packings appear to be a common property of different types of confined repulsive particle systems @xcite , while the character of the intervening phases seems to depend more strongly on the exact details of the particle - particle interactions and the confining potential .",
    "for example , at high spring constants we do not observe any new phases between 1@xmath25 and 2@xmath27 in the harmonic potential , while the same hard spheres in a hard slit would form an intermediate buckled bilayer structure ( @xmath52 ) @xcite , and while charged particles in an effective harmonic potential are expected to form the sequence @xmath53 in the limit @xmath40 @xcite . in the latter system , which considered point - like particles ,",
    "the long - ranged repulsive coulomb interactions between the particles compete with the attraction to the minimum of the confining potential .",
    "remarkably , as the harmonic confinement becomes softer ( lower spring constant ) , we do find stable intervening phases , which , however , are not ordered . instead of the more commonly observed solid - to - solid transformations , the system undergoes a couple of re - entrant melting transitions that give rise to intervening liquid phases , with triple points around \\{@xmath54 , @xmath55 } and \\{@xmath56 , @xmath57}. thus , around @xmath58 we observe freezing into a stable 1@xmath25 phase , which then re - melts into a disordered liquid before freezing again into the 2@xmath27 phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , while for higher densities we find the same alternating sequence of hexagonal and square packings as before .",
    "we further see that the softer the confinement , the higher the density at which the initial liquid phase still persists and at sufficiently low spring constants ( @xmath59 ) the first stable ordered structures actually consist of more than one layer . for example , at @xmath60 the first ordered phase is 2@xmath25 , followed by re - entrant melting , the 3@xmath27 structure , and then the other multi - layered ordered phases , whereas for @xmath61 we only observe the latter , without any intermediate melting .",

    "the insets give the probability distribution of observing a given density at coexistence chemical potential on the same density scale as the main plot.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     ( color online ) particle distribution along the axis of confinement ( @xmath20 ) , for @xmath35 and different densities .",

    "blue squares : 2@xmath27 , @xmath69.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to make sure that the re - entrant liquid phases did not represent finite - size artifacts , we performed simulations with three different box sizes ( @xmath70 10 , 20 or 50 ) for @xmath35 , fig .",
    "it can be seen that the results for the different system sizes are essentially identical and that there is a clear transition from the 1@xmath25 phase to a re - entrant liquid and then to the 2@xmath27 phase , as reflected by the @xmath29 bond order parameter ratio .",
    "we also determined the density probability distributions at coexistence @xcite using histogram - reweighing @xcite and expanded ensemble @xcite simulations ( insets in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "for both the 1@xmath71 and the @xmath72 transitions we find bimodal probability distributions that are characteristic of a first - order phase transition .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the spatial distribution of the particles in the soft confining potential for different densities outside the coexistence region .",
    "as expected , in the 1@xmath25 phase the particle distribution has a single peak centered at the energy minimum @xmath73 and in the 2@xmath27 phase there are two peaks which are symmetrically located with respect to @xmath73 .",
    "the intervening re - entrant liquid starts out with a flat and broad distribution of the particles at low densities , which then continuously transforms into a doubly peaked profile as the density increases .",
    "interestingly , this occurs without further ordering of the particles in the @xmath5 plane , so that the result is a layered liquid .",
    "others have shown that if the same hard spheres are confined between impenetrable hard walls , a highly ordered buckled structure forms when the wall separation is larger than required for the 1@xmath25 phase , but too small for the 2@xmath27 phase @xcite .",
    "this buckled @xmath52 phase optimizes the particle packing in the available space between the two walls by splitting the 1@xmath25 structure into rows of particles that alternate in height , effectively forming a crystal of two interpenetrating rectangular layers , which continuously transforms into the 2@xmath27 structure as the wall separation increases . in the harmonically constrained system , the re - entrant layered liquid fulfills a similar interpolating role between the one and two - layer ordered phases , but the additional energy considerations and greater positional freedom under soft confinement , together with the absence of long - ranged particle interactions favor disordered over ordered phases .",
    "we have identified the stable phases of hard spheres under harmonic confinement , as a function of the density and the softness of the confining potential .",
    "we find the well - known ` base ' sequence of alternating hexagonal and square - symmetric packings ( @xmath39 ) , which thus appears to be quite insensitive to the details of the ( confining ) interactions .",
    "when we look at the presence of stable intervening phases the soft - confined hard - sphere system is clearly different from hard - confined systems , though . instead of the usual highly ordered interpolating particle packings",
    ", we observe phase separation between the hexagonally and square packed structures under strong confinement , and disordered re - entrant liquid ( @xmath38 ) phases under weaker confinement . for 1@xmath71 and @xmath72 ,",
    "we have shown that the re - entrant melting / freezing transition has a first - order character and that the liquid develops a layered structure , without further ordering of the particles .",
    "we argue that the re - entrant and phase separating behaviors are due to the fact that the penetrable soft harmonic potential on the one hand offers more positional freedom than hard - wall confinement does , while , on the other hand , making an important energy contribution to the overall free energy of the system which depends on the exact particle positions ( in addition to the usual entropic considerations for hard spheres ) .",
    "the net result is a smaller diversity of crystalline packings , as compared to hard spheres between two hard walls .",
    "we expect that other soft confining potentials may well have a similar effect , although the details of the phase diagram will likely be different .",
    "the fact that certain ordered structures can be reliably obtained , while many other structures can be induced or suppressed on demand through a variation of the confinement conditions is important for applications that involve self - assembled structures of colloidal particles .",
    "interestingly , it should be possible to realize harmonic confining potentials with dynamically tunable softness experimentally , for instance in a dielectrophoretic trap .",
