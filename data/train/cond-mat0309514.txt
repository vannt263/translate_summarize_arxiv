    "the original goal of pioneering physicists like galileo , newton and einstein was to predict dynamical behavior in the universe - from projectiles to planets and even photons . however , complex systems in nature are not soluble with analytic or direct computational methods if the space of system descriptions is too large . examples",
    "are master equations - widely used in many disciplines - or quantum theory itself , where the hilbert space for many - body systems is enormous .",
    "this is one of the central problems of modern theoretical physics .",
    "the problem of complexity inspired a claim by feynman@xcite that reads ;    * `` can a quantum system be probabilistically simulated by a classical universal computer ?",
    "... the answer is certainly , * no * ! '' ( richard p. feynman , _ simulating physics with computers , _",
    "1982 )    in this paper , we will give a very general overview of new techniques for probabilistic simulation , called stochastic gauge representations@xcite , which allow these ` impossible ' simulations .",
    "like wigner s original representation@xcite , these are phase - space representations , but in phase - spaces of larger than classical dimension .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to explain the abstract ideas behind stochastic gauges , which are essentially an equivalence class of curved - space path - integrals in a complex phase - space .",
    "we compare the method with other phase - space approaches , as well as giving elementary examples .    even in feynman s",
    "day , the introduction of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite and related path integral techniques indicated a possible way to solve problems of large hilbert space dimension .",
    "while these methods are used to treat canonical ensembles , they can not treat real - time dynamics . presumably , it was the failure of qmc methods in real time - due to the highly oscillatory behaviour of the real - time feynman path - integral - that caused feynman to neglect these types of random sampling methods .    in a more recent publication ,",
    "the time - domain quantum simulation problem was restated by ceperley@xcite , as follows :    * `` there are serious problems in calculating the dynamics of quantum systems '' ( david m. ceperley , _ _ microscopic simulations in physic__s , 1999 ) .",
    "the problems are due to the astronomical size of many - body hilbert spaces .",
    "this makes it difficult to treat the quantum dynamics of bose - einstein condensates - which typically have @xmath0 or more particles , and @xmath1 states in hilbert space . in this paper",
    ", we show that stochastic gauge methods are versatile enough to treat complex quantum systems including master equations and canonical ensembles , as well as many - body quantum dynamics in real time .",
    "phase - space mappings , which map the discrete states of quantum theory into a classical - like phase - space , were originally introduced by wigner in the form of the famous wigner representation@xcite . in the stochastic version of these methods ,",
    "ensemble averages are mapped into trajectory averages - which can be numerically simulated .",
    "phase - space representations have developed in three distinct stages . in the first stage ,",
    "the wigner representation , husimi@xcite q - representation and glauber - sudarshan@xcite p - representation all use a classical phase - space of @xmath2 real dimensions for quantum systems corresponding to @xmath3 classical modes .",
    "these methods typically will not give locally positive propagators for nonlinear quantum systems .",
    "hence they can not have a directly equivalent stochastic process .    in the second stage",
    ", higher dimensional representations were developed .",
    "these include the glauber r - representation@xcite ( which is non - positive ) , the poisson representation ( for incoherent master equations only ) , and for quantum systems , the positive p - representation@xcite .",
    "the last two methods give locally positive propagators , by virtue of using a non - classical phase - space .",
    "however , while they work very well for damped systems , in highly nonlinear simulations they typically develop unstable trajectories@xcite leading to large sampling errors or even systematic errors in nonlinear quantum simulations .",
    "these simulation problems are caused by the distributions having power - law tails in phase - space@xcite .",
    "when this happens , the distributions are not sufficiently localized to allow integration by parts , which is a crucial step in the derivation .    in the current stage ,",
    "gauge representations are used , which add a further complex gauge amplitude * @xmath4 * to the representation phase - space .",
    "these provide a way to overcome feynman s complexity dilemma , and are the subject of the present paper . for appropriate gauge choices these methods",
    "are conjectured to be exact in principle .",
    "they have no instabilities , and we will show that numerical simulations give no systematic errors , even in cases where previous methods would have boundary term errors .",
    "numerical implementations are still necessarily approximate due to the usual limitations of finite computers , but error levels can be estimated and reduced to any desired level compatible with the hardware and time available .    to understand the reason for these developments , it is useful to enumerate the requirements for a phase - space representation that can be used to map quantum dynamics into a stochastic differential equation , which can be simulated numerically .",
    "they are as follows :    1 .   * _ non - singular : _ * essential _ _ for finite probabilities , although an initial delta function can be tolerated . _",
    "_ positive distribution : _ * needed to get positive initial probabilities . 3 .",
    "* _ uv convergent : _ * to control sampling error on lattices , vacuum fluctuations should not diverge at large momentum cut - off .",
    "4 .   * _ 2nd - order derivatives : _ * the mapping must generate at most second - order derivatives , to obtain diffusive phase - space behavior .",
    "_ positive - definite propagator : _ * the short - time propagator must be positive - definite , for an equivalent stochastic process to exist .",
    "_ stable : _ * trajectories in phase - space should be stable to prevent boundary term errors : further restrictions on noise growth are also needed .    how do the known phase - space representations compare ?",
    "this is shown in table 1 , for a system of much current interest , the anharmonic oscillator  see sec .",
    "[ anharm ] .",
    ".table of representation properties required for stochastic quantum dynamics [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     by comparison , the unstable ungauged poisson method clearly gives enormous sampling errors , with incorrect averages in @xmath5 due to systematic boundary term errors .",
    "while this problem is relatively simple ( for purposes of illustration ) , the stochastic techniques given here are easily extended to more complex problems where the original master equations can not be solved directly .",
    "more details of this will be given elsewhere@xcite .",
    "for computational purposes , we can reduce the bose gas hamiltonian to a lattice hamiltonian which contains all the essential features .",
    "this includes nonlinear interactions at each of @xmath3 sites or modes , together with linear interactions that couple different sites together .",
    "such problems are important for quantum gases trapped in optical lattices , or in low - dimensional environments , where evidence for quantum coherence and particle antibunching has been inferred in recent experiments .",
    "the simplest case that can represent a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a one - mode trap has @xmath6 , so :    @xmath7    in this normally ordered hamiltonian , the operator @xmath8 is the boson number operator .",
    "the above hamiltonian can be easily generalized to many important interacting bose gas models .",
    "the canonical ensemble in thermal equilibrium for the one - mode case is an exactly soluble problem , which can be used to illustrate the gauge method .",
    "applications in less trivial cases will appear elsewhere .",
    "it is an interesting historical note that the quantum correction to a classical canonical ensemble calculation was the first application@xcite of the wigner distribution , and wigner regarded the effect of bose or fermi statistics to be a serious issue to be addressed in future .",
    "the un - normalized grand canonical quantum density matrix is defined for our purposes as a slight modification to the usual form in statistical mechanics .",
    "we let : @xmath9\\,\\,,\\label{rho - defn}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . we choose @xmath12 to give a high - temperature initial state at @xmath13 with an initial occupation of @xmath14\\approx1/\\varepsilon$ ] at each site .",
    "thus , the effective chemical potential is actually @xmath15 .",

    "let us expand the density matrix @xmath20 on an off - diagonal coherent state basis set in the manner of the positive p distribution .",
    "this is given in ( [ cohstate ] ) .",
    "the initial g - distribution is gaussian : @xmath21\\delta^{2}(\\alpha-\\beta^{*})\\delta^{2}(\\omega-1)\\,\\,.\\label{p0}\\ ] ]    to determine the effects of the ` kamiltonian ' @xmath22 on @xmath23 , it is first necessary to calculate the effect of the annihilation and creation operators on the projectors @xmath24 .",

    "using these operator identities , the operator equation ( [ rho - evolve ] ) can be transformed to a differential equation .",
    "the ( ungauged ) differential operator acting on the basis @xmath24 is @xmath26\\\\   & = & -k(\\mu,\\alpha,\\beta)+\\sum_{j=1}^{2}\\left[a'_{j}\\partial_{j}+\\frac{1}{2}d_{j}\\partial_{j}^{2}\\right]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to simplify notation , define @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "then @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .    following the main procedure summarized in eq ( [ central ] ) ,",
    "a gauge correction is utilized to stabilize coherent state paths in highly non - classical regions in phase - space .",
    "this allows one to benefit greatly from the over - completeness of coherent states , in reducing the sampling error and eliminating boundary terms . to stabilize large modulus trajectories which otherwise can lead to boundary term errors and large sampling uncertainties , we choose drift gauges @xmath32 , giving:@xmath33\\alpha_{j}+i\\alpha_{j}\\sqrt{\\chi}\\zeta_{j}\\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{d\\omega}{d\\tau } & = & \\left[-k(\\mu,{\\bm\\alpha})+\\sum_{j=1}^{2}g_{j}\\zeta_{j}\\right]\\omega\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    there is an intuitive physical interpretation . since @xmath34 in the initial thermal state , each amplitude initially obeys a gross - pitaevskii equation in imaginary time , with quantum phase - noise due to the interactions .",
    "this causes non - classical statistics with @xmath35 to emerge at low temperatures .",
    "along each path an additional ensemble weight @xmath36 is accumulated , which is logarithmically proportional to the kamiltonian @xmath37 .",
    "the zero - temperature steady - state is the usual gross - pitaevskii approximation , together with quantum corrections .    to illustrate the method ,",
    "first consider the non - interacting case with @xmath38 , where we can set the gauge to zero , and define @xmath39 , giving a diagonal glauber p - distribution .",
    "then:@xmath40    the power of the normal - ordered coherent state expansion is shown by the fact that these equations are deterministic , _ even though they include all quantum fluctuations_. by contrast , the corresponding path - integral equations have large vacuum noise terms .",
    "these equations can be integrated immediately to give a bose - einstein thermal ensemble with gaussian fluctuations : @xmath41\\right\\rangle _ { s}}{\\left\\langle \\omega(\\tau)\\right\\rangle _ { s}}=\\frac{1}{\\exp([\\omega-\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}]\\tau)-1}\\,\\,.\\label{thermal}\\ ] ]    next , consider the exactly soluble interacting case , involving a single bose mode with:@xmath42    a numerical simulation is of most interest here , as it can be generalized to other bose gas systems of greater complexity .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain agreement with the exact solution for large boson number , as quantum - noise corrections are small in this limit .",
    "instead , we focus on the case furthest from coherent statistics with @xmath43 , giving just one boson in the zero - temperature limit , and choose @xmath44 . this case is shown in fig ( [ figg2nbar ] ) , as well as a comparison with the exact results .",
    "[ figg2nbar ]    the results can be seen to agree well with the exact analytic ones , and the agreement is easily improved by increasing the number of stochastic trajectories .",
    "this excellent agreement also occurs with much larger numbers of bosons .",
    "the physical behaviour of strong particle antibunching is in agreement with evidence deduced from recent experiments in optical lattices .",
    "the quantum dynamics of the anharmonic oscillator is the subject of much current interest .",
    "one can combine the previous canonical technique with a real - time evolution , in order to model a transient experiment in which a bec is first cooled , then allowed to evolve after a change in the hamiltonian .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian to be eq ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , the same as previously .",
    "this type of problem has been studied previously as part of more extended multi - mode studies on quantum solitons , leading to the prediction and observation of quantum squeezing in solitons@xcite .",
    "other applications include first - principles studies of evaporative cooling@xcite , and a treatment of phase - diffusion@xcite using an approximate wigner technique , starting from a coherent state .",
    "the present technique is exact rather than approximate , though it predicts , as expected , the same behaviour of phase - diffusion and amplitude decay from an initial coherent state .",
    "however , we shall just consider the one - mode case here .    we find the following salient points :    *",
    "diffusion gauges work better than drift gauges at controlling sampling error * sampling error grows with time * diffusion gauges work by trading off ( increasing ) phase noise against intensity noise * even better results occur if drift and diffusion gauges are combined * it is possible to simulate past the time of amplitude decay    as previously , we use the stochastic gauge procedure of eq ( [ central ] ) .",
    "the resulting ito equations in an arbitrary drift gauge are as follows , where @xmath45 @xmath46 are the two variables that correspond to @xmath47 in a coherent state ( positive - p ) expansion .",
    "we define @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath27 , corresponding to @xmath50 :    @xmath51    here @xmath52 .",
    "these equations correspond to a diagonal noise matrix of form :    @xmath53.\\label{bmat}\\ ] ]    it is convenient to use an equivalent diffusion gauge with a noise matrix @xmath54 defined in terms of a parameter @xmath55 , using an orthogonal transform @xmath56 so that :    @xmath57\\,\\,.\\label{umat}\\ ] ]    we also introduce new variables @xmath58",
    "where:@xmath59    these variables are interpreted as the logarithmic amplitude and phase respectively .",
    "their equations including gauge terms are :    @xmath60\\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\tau } & = & e^{-a}(1-i)\\left[(\\zeta_{1}-g_{1})+i(\\zeta_{2}-g_{2})\\right]\\label{phiequn}\\\\ \\frac{d\\omega}{d\\tau } & = & \\sum_{j=1}^{2}g_{j}\\zeta_{j}\\omega\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    without any drift gauge , these equations have the problem that the logarithmic ratio of amplitudes ( imaginary phase ) @xmath61|$ ] can grow rapidly whenever the quantum noise causes @xmath62 to have an imaginary part , resulting in a large sampling error .",
    "this can be controlled to some extent with the diffusion gauge technique@xcite , which allows us to make @xmath55 large and positive , thereby reducing the quantum noise in @xmath62 .",
    "this , however , is at the expense of an increase in quantum noise in the phase , and can only delay the onset of the rapid growth in @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "even better results are obtained by combining diffusion and drift gauges .",
    "we choose the gauge @xmath64e^{-a}=-ig_{2}$ ] .",
    "this has the property that only noise drives the ratio of amplitudes@xmath65}{d\\tau}=e^{a}(\\zeta_{2}-\\zeta_{1})\\label{gaugeequn}\\ ] ] as opposed to the un - gauged equation of:@xmath65}{d\\tau}=-4\\im[n]+e^{a}(\\zeta_{2}-\\zeta_{1})\\label{nogauge}\\ ] ]    typical results are shown in figure ( [ graph - of - sampling - error ] ) , which gives the time - dependence of the sampling error with different gauges .",
    "this indicates substantial increases in useful simulation times compared to any previous phase - space technique@xcite .",
    "we note that the sampling error still increases with time .",
    "this appears to be inevitable with current stochastic gauge methods , which stabilize trajectories but introduce an increasing uncertainty in the relevant quantum amplitude .",
    "complexity is a major , even central problem in modern theoretical physics .",
    "our fundamental description of nature , quantum field theory , is incredibly complex in terms of the hilbert space dimension - far more so than any classical description .",
    "mappings to phase - spaces of reduced dimensionality therefore provide an attractive route to overcoming this complexity problem . for best results , however , one wishes to have a stochastic mapping , where the dynamics in phase - space obey a local stochastic description . in these cases",
    "the mapping permits a way to sample the complex dynamics over a finite set of samples , thus providing a controllable approximation to the exact dynamics .",
    "the wigner representation is the pioneering method in phase - space that maps quantum mechanics into a classical phase - space .",
    "however , it has some drawbacks .",
    "it gives large vacuum fluctuations in quantum field simulations , and is essentially non - stochastic , as it is not a positive - definite representation .",
    "all the other techniques that have been introduced for classical phase - spaces , like the glauber p - representation , have similar problems .",
    "this includes even the q - representation - which is always positive , but has no local positive propagator when the hamiltonian is nonlinear .",
    "more modern techniques like the positive - p representation , solve most of the technical problems due to lack of positivity , but can give boundary term errors due to moving singularities in the drift equations .",
    "gauge techniques solve these known mathematical problems by stabilizing the drift equations .",
    "however , in specific cases , one still needs to find the optimum method or gauge field .",
    "several examples of workable gauges in different cases and bases have been given here , and their utility demonstrated by comparison with exact results .",
    "in the long run , such techniques can allow one to make progress toward calculations that involve interacting many - body systems .",
    "we note that the gauge approach is rather general , since in any particular case one can optimize the basis set , the gauge , and even the algorithm for sampling the weighted trajectories .    from the larger theoretical perspective",
    "these are important issues , as we treat more challenging complex systems , including possible tests of quantum mechanics in new regions of macroscopic and entangled quantum systems",
