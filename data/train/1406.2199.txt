    "recognition of human actions in videos is a challenging task which has received a significant amount of attention in the research community  @xcite .",
    "compared to still image classification , the temporal component of videos provides an additional ( and important ) clue for recognition , as a number of actions can be reliably recognised based on the motion information .",
    "additionally , video provides natural data augmentation ( jittering ) for single image ( video frame ) classification .    in this work",
    ", we aim at extending deep convolutional networks ( convnets )  @xcite , a state - of - the - art still image representation  @xcite , to action recognition in video data .",
    "this task has recently been addressed in  @xcite by using stacked video frames as input to the network , but the results were significantly worse than those of the best hand - crafted shallow representations  @xcite .",
    "we investigate a different architecture based on two separate recognition streams ( spatial and temporal ) , which are then combined by late fusion .",
    "the spatial stream performs action recognition from still video frames , whilst the temporal stream is trained to recognise action from motion in the form of dense optical flow .",
    "both streams are implemented as convnets .",
    "decoupling the spatial and temporal nets also allows us to exploit the availability of large amounts of annotated image data by pre - training the spatial net on the imagenet challenge dataset  @xcite .",
    "our proposed architecture is related to the two - streams hypothesis  @xcite , according to which the human visual cortex contains two pathways : the ventral stream ( which performs object recognition ) and the dorsal stream ( which recognises motion ) ; though we do not investigate this connection any further here .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in  sect .",
    "[ sec : related_work ] we review the related work on action recognition using both shallow and deep architectures . in  sect .",
    "[ sec : arch ] we introduce the two - stream architecture and specify the spatial convnet . sect .",
    "[ sec : temp_net ] introduces the temporal convnet and in particular how it generalizes the previous architectures reviewed in  sect .",
    "[ sec : related_work ] .",
    "a mult - task learning framework is developed in  sect .",
    "[ sec : multi ] in order to allow effortless combination of training data over multiple datasets .",
    "implementation details are given in  sect .",
    "[ sec : impl ] , and the performance is evaluated in  sect .",
    "[ sec : eval ] and compared to the state of the art .",
    "our experiments on two challenging datasets ( ucf-101  @xcite and hmdb-51  @xcite ) show that the two recognition streams are complementary , and our deep architecture significantly outperforms that of  @xcite and is competitive with the state of the art shallow representations  @xcite in spite of being trained on relatively small datasets .",
    "video recognition research has been largely driven by the advances in image recognition methods , which were often adapted and extended to deal with video data .",
    "a large family of video action recognition methods is based on shallow high - dimensional encodings of local spatio - temporal features .",
    "for instance , the algorithm of  @xcite consists in detecting sparse spatio - temporal interest points , which are then described using local spatio - temporal features : histogram of oriented gradients ( hog )  @xcite and histogram of optical flow ( hof ) . the features",
    "are then encoded into the bag of features ( bof ) representation , which is pooled over several spatio - temporal grids ( similarly to spatial pyramid pooling ) and combined with an svm classifier . in a later work",
    "@xcite , it was shown that dense sampling of local features outperforms sparse interest points .    instead of computing local video features over spatio - temporal cuboids",
    ", state - of - the - art shallow video representations  @xcite make use of dense point trajectories .",
    "the approach , first introduced in  @xcite , consists in adjusting local descriptor support regions , so that they follow dense trajectories , computed using optical flow .",
    "the best performance in the trajectory - based pipeline was achieved by the motion boundary histogram ( mbh )  @xcite , which is a gradient - based feature , separately computed on the horizontal and vertical components of optical flow .",
    "a combination of several features was shown to further boost the accuracy .",
    "recent improvements of trajectory - based hand - crafted representations include compensation of global ( camera ) motion  @xcite , and the use of the fisher vector encoding  @xcite ( in  @xcite ) or its deeper variant  @xcite ( in  @xcite ) .",
    "there has also been a number of attempts to develop a deep architecture for video recognition . in the majority of these works ,",
    "the input to the network is a stack of consecutive video frames , so the model is expected to implicitly learn spatio - temporal motion - dependent features in the first layers , which can be a difficult task . in  @xcite , an hmax architecture for video recognition",
    "was proposed with pre - defined spatio - temporal filters in the first layer .",
    "later , it was combined  @xcite with a spatial hmax model , thus forming spatial ( ventral - like ) and temporal ( dorsal - like ) recognition streams .",
    "unlike our work , however , the streams were implemented as hand - crafted and rather shallow ( 3-layer ) hmax models . in  @xcite",
    ", a convolutional rbm and isa were used for unsupervised learning of spatio - temporal features , which were then plugged into a discriminative model for action classification .",
    "discriminative end - to - end learning of video convnets has been addressed in  @xcite and , more recently , in  @xcite , who compared several convnet architectures for action recognition .",
    "training was carried out on a very large sports-1 m dataset , comprising 1.1 m youtube videos of sports activities .",
    "interestingly ,  @xcite found that a network , operating on individual video frames , performs similarly to the networks , whose input is a stack of frames .",
    "this might indicate that the learnt spatio - temporal features do not capture the motion well .",
    "the learnt representation , fine - tuned on the ucf-101 dataset , turned out to be @xmath0 less accurate than hand - crafted state - of - the - art trajectory - based representation  @xcite .",
    "our temporal stream convnet operates on multiple - frame dense optical flow , which is typically computed in an energy minimisation framework by solving for a displacement field ( typically at multiple image scales ) .",
    "we used a popular method of  @xcite , which formulates the energy based on constancy assumptions for intensity and its gradient , as well as smoothness of the displacement field . recently",
    ",  @xcite proposed an image patch matching scheme , which is reminiscent of deep convnets , but does not incorporate learning .",
    "video can naturally be decomposed into spatial and temporal components .",
    "the spatial part , in the form of individual frame appearance , carries information about scenes and objects depicted in the video .",
    "the temporal part , in the form of motion across the frames , conveys the movement of the observer ( the camera ) and the objects .",
    "we devise our video recognition architecture accordingly , dividing it into two streams , as shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : arch ] .",
    "each stream is implemented using a deep convnet , softmax scores of which are combined by late fusion .",
    "we consider two fusion methods : averaging and training a multi - class linear svm  @xcite on stacked @xmath1-normalised softmax scores as features .        *",
    "spatial stream convnet * operates on individual video frames , effectively performing action recognition from still images .",
    "the static appearance by itself is a useful clue , since some actions are strongly associated with particular objects .",
    "in fact , as will be shown in  sect .  [ sec : eval ] , action classification from still frames ( the spatial recognition stream ) is fairly competitive on its own . since a spatial convnet is essentially an image classification architecture , we can build upon the recent advances in large - scale image recognition methods  @xcite , and pre - train the network on a large image classification dataset , such as the imagenet challenge dataset .",
    "the details are presented in  sect .",
    "[ sec : impl ] .",
    "next , we describe the temporal stream convnet , which exploits motion and significantly improves accuracy .",
    "in this section , we describe a convnet model , which forms the temporal recognition stream of our architecture ( sect .",
    "[ sec : arch ] ) . unlike the convnet models , reviewed in  sect .",
    "[ sec : related_work ] , the input to our model is formed by stacking optical flow displacement fields between several consecutive frames .",
    "such input explicitly describes the motion between video frames , which makes the recognition easier , as the network does not need to estimate motion implicitly .",

    "it is natural to consider an extension to a bi - directional optical flow , which can be obtained by computing an additional set of displacement fields in the opposite direction .",
    "we then construct an input volume @xmath19 by stacking @xmath25 forward flows between frames @xmath16 and @xmath26 and @xmath25 backward flows between frames @xmath27 and @xmath16 . the input",

    ", the displacement vector field components can take on both positive and negative values , and are naturally centered in the sense that across a large variety of motions , the movement in one direction is as probable as the movement in the opposite one .",
    "however , given a pair of frames , the optical flow between them can be dominated by a particular displacement , e.g.caused by the camera movement .",

    "above we have described different ways of combining multiple optical flow displacement fields into a single volume @xmath15 . considering that a convnet requires a fixed - size input , we sample a @xmath29 sub - volume from @xmath19 and pass it to the net as input . the hidden layers configuration remains largely the same as that used in the spatial net , and is illustrated in  fig .",

    ", we put our temporal convnet architecture in the context of prior art , drawing connections to the video representations , reviewed in  sect .",

    "methods based on feature encodings  @xcite typically combine several spatio - temporal local features . such features are computed from the optical flow and are thus generalised by our temporal convnet . indeed , the hof and mbh local descriptors are based on the histograms of orientations of optical flow or its gradient , which can be obtained from the displacement field input   using a single convolutional layer ( containing orientation - sensitive filters ) , followed by the rectification and pooling layers .",
    "the kinematic features of  @xcite ( divergence , curl and shear ) are also computed from the optical flow gradient , and , again , can be captured by our convolutional model .",
    "finally , the trajectory feature  @xcite is computed by stacking the displacement vectors along the trajectory , which corresponds to the trajectory stacking  . in  sect .",
    "[ sec : vis_conv ] we visualise the convolutional filters , learnt in the first layer of the temporal network .",
    "this provides further evidence that our representation generalises hand - crafted features .",
    "as far as the deep networks are concerned , a two - stream video classification architecture of  @xcite contains two hmax models which are hand - crafted and less deep than our discriminatively trained convnets , which can be seen as a learnable generalisation of hmax .",
    "the convolutional models of  @xcite do not decouple spatial and temporal recognition streams , and rely on the motion - sensitive convolutional filters , learnt from the data . in our case ,",
    "motion is explicitly represented using the optical flow displacement field , computed based on the assumptions of constancy of the intensity and smoothness of the flow . incorporating such assumptions into a convnet framework might be able to boost the performance of end - to - end convnet - based methods , and is an interesting direction for future research .          in  fig .",
    "[ fig : conv1 ] we visualise the convolutional filters from the first layer of the temporal convnet , trained on the ucf-101 dataset .",
    "each of the @xmath30 filters has a spatial receptive field of @xmath31 pixels , and spans 20 input channels , corresponding to the horizontal ( @xmath32 ) and vertical ( @xmath2 ) components of @xmath33 stacked optical flow displacement fields @xmath28 .    as can be seen , some filters compute spatial derivatives of the optical flow , capturing how motion changes with image location , which generalises derivative - based hand - crafted descriptors ( e.g.mbh ) .",
    "other filters compute temporal derivatives , capturing changes in motion over time .",
    "unlike the spatial stream convnet , which can be pre - trained on a large still image classification dataset ( such as imagenet ) , the temporal convnet needs to be trained on video data  and the available datasets for video action classification are still rather small . in our experiments ( sect .",
    "[ sec : eval ] ) , training is performed on the ucf-101 and hmdb-51 datasets , which have only : 9.5k and 3.7k videos respectively . to decrease over - fitting , one could consider combining the two datasets into one ; this , however , is not straightforward due to the intersection between the sets of classes .",
    "one option ( which we evaluate later ) is to only add the images from the classes , which do not appear in the original dataset .",
    "this , however , requires manual search for such classes and limits the amount of additional training data .    a more principled way of combining several datasets is based on multi - task learning  @xcite .",
    "its aim is to learn a ( video ) representation , which is applicable not only to the task in question ( such as hmdb-51 classification ) , but also to other tasks ( e.g.ucf-101 classification ) .",
    "additional tasks act as a regulariser , and allow for the exploitation of additional training data . in our case , a convnet architecture is modified so that it has _ two _ softmax classification layers on top of the last fully - connected layer : one softmax layer computes hmdb-51 classification scores , the other one  the ucf-101 scores . each of the layers is equipped with its own loss function , which operates only on the videos , coming from the respective dataset .",
    "the overall training loss is computed as the sum of the individual tasks losses , and the network weight derivatives can be found by back - propagation .",
    "[ sec : impl : spatial ] [ sec : impl : temporal ]    * convnets configuration . *",
    "the layer configuration of our spatial and temporal convnets is schematically shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : arch ] .",
    "it corresponds to cnn - m-2048 architecture of  @xcite and is similar to the network of  @xcite .",
    "all hidden weight layers use the rectification ( relu ) activation function ; max - pooling is performed over @xmath34 spatial windows with stride 2 ; local response normalisation uses the same settings as  @xcite .",
    "the only difference between spatial and temporal convnet configurations is that we removed the second normalisation layer from the latter to reduce memory consumption .",
    "* training .",
    "* the training procedure can be seen as an adaptation of that of  @xcite to video frames , and is generally the same for both spatial and temporal nets .",
    "the network weights are learnt using the mini - batch stochastic gradient descent with momentum ( set to 0.9 ) . at each iteration ,",
    "a mini - batch of 256 samples is constructed by sampling 256 training videos ( uniformly across the classes ) , from each of which a single frame is randomly selected . in spatial net training , a @xmath35 sub - image is randomly cropped from the selected frame ; it then undergoes random horizontal flipping and rgb jittering .",
    "the videos are rescaled beforehand , so that the smallest side of the frame equals 256 .",
    "we note that unlike  @xcite , the sub - image is sampled from the whole frame , not just its @xmath36 center . in the temporal net training",
    ", we compute an optical flow volume @xmath37 for the selected training frame as described in  sect .",
    "[ sec : temp_net ] . from that volume",
    ", a fixed - size @xmath29 input is randomly cropped and flipped .",
    "the learning rate is initially set to @xmath38 , and then decreased according to a fixed schedule , which is kept the same for all training sets .",
    "namely , when training a convnet from scratch , the rate is changed to @xmath39 after 50k iterations , then to @xmath40 after 70k iterations , and training is stopped after 80k iterations . in the fine - tuning scenario ,",
    "the rate is changed to @xmath39 after 14k iterations , and training stopped after 20k iterations .",
    "* testing .",
    "* at test time , given a video , we sample a fixed number of frames ( @xmath41 in our experiments ) with equal temporal spacing between them . from each of the frames",
    "we then obtain 10 convnet inputs  @xcite by cropping and flipping four corners and the center of the frame .",
    "the class scores for the whole video are then obtained by averaging the scores across the sampled frames and crops therein .    * pre - training on imagenet ilsvrc-2012 .",
    "* when pre - training the spatial convnet , we use the same training and test data augmentation as described above ( cropping , flipping , rgb jittering ) .",
    "this yields @xmath42 top-5 error on ilsvrc-2012 validation set , which compares favourably to @xmath43 reported in  @xcite for a similar network .",
    "we believe that the main reason for the improvement is sampling of convnet inputs from the whole image , rather than just its center .",
    "* multi - gpu training . * our implementation is derived from the publicly available caffe toolbox  @xcite , but contains a number of significant modifications , including parallel training on multiple gpus installed in a single system .",
    "we exploit the data parallelism , and split each sgd batch across several gpus .",
    "training a single temporal convnet takes 1 day on a system with 4 nvidia titan cards , which constitutes a @xmath44 times speed - up over single - gpu training .    * optical flow * is computed using the off - the - shelf gpu implementation of  @xcite from the opencv toolbox . in spite of the fast computation time",
    "( @xmath45s for a pair of frames ) , it would still introduce a bottleneck if done on - the - fly , so we pre - computed the flow before training . to avoid storing the displacement fields as floats ,",
    "the horizontal and vertical components of the flow were linearly rescaled to a @xmath46 $ ] range and compressed using jpeg ( after decompression , the flow is rescaled back to its original range ) .",
    "this reduced the flow size for the ucf-101 dataset from 1.5 tb to 27 gb .",
    "* datasets and evaluation protocol . *",
    "the evaluation is performed on ucf-101  @xcite and  @xcite action recognition benchmarks , which are among the largest available annotated video datasets .",
    "ucf-101 contains 13k videos ( 180 frames / video on average ) , annotated into 101 action classes ; hmdb-51 includes 6.8k videos of 51 actions .",
    "the evaluation protocol is the same for both datasets : the organisers provide three splits into training and test data , and the performance is measured by the mean classification accuracy across the splits .",
    "each ucf-101 split contains 9.5k training videos ; an hmdb-51 split contains 3.7k training videos .",
    "we begin by comparing different architectures on the first split of the ucf-101 dataset . for comparison with the state of the art , we follow the standard evaluation protocol and report the average accuracy over three splits on both ucf-101 and hmdb-51 .",
    "* spatial convnets . *",
    "first , we measure the performance of the spatial stream convnet .",
    "three scenarios are considered : ( i ) training from scratch on ucf-101 , ( ii ) pre - training on ilsvrc-2012 followed by fine - tuning on ucf-101 , ( iii ) keeping the pre - trained network fixed and only training the last ( classification ) layer . for each of the settings ,",
    "we experiment with setting the dropout regularisation ratio to @xmath47 or to @xmath48 . from the results , presented in  table  [ tab : spatial ] , it is clear that training the convnet solely on the ucf-101 dataset leads to over - fitting ( even with high dropout ) , and is inferior to pre - training on a large ilsvrc-2012 dataset .",
    "interestingly , fine - tuning the whole network gives only marginal improvement over training the last layer only . in the latter setting , higher dropout over - regularises learning and leads to worse accuracy . in the following experiments we opted for training the last layer on top of a pre - trained convnet",

[ fig : conf ] we show the confusion matrix for ucf-101 classification using our two - stream model , which achieves @xmath49 accuracy on the first dataset split ( the last row of  table  [ tab : fusion ] ) .",
    "we also visualise the corresponding per - class recall in  fig .",
    "[ fig : recall ] .",
    "the worst class recall corresponds to _ hammering _ class , which is confused with _",
    "headmassage _ and _ brushingteeth _ classes .",
    "we found that this is due to two reasons .",
    "first , the spatial convnet confuses _ hammering _ with _ headmassage _ , which can be caused by the significant presence of human faces in both classes .",
    "second , the temporal convnet confuses _ hammering _ with _ brushingteeth _ , as both actions contain recurring motion patterns ( hand moving up and down ) .",
    "we proposed a deep video classification model with competitive performance , which incorporates separate spatial and temporal recognition streams based on convnets .",
    "currently it appears that training a temporal convnet on optical flow ( as here ) is significantly better than training on raw stacked frames  @xcite .",
    "the latter is probably too challenging , and might require architectural changes ( for example , a combination with the deep matching approach of  @xcite ) . despite using optical flow as input , our temporal model does not require significant hand - crafting , since the flow is computed using a method based on the generic assumptions of constancy and smoothness .",
    "as we have shown , extra training data is beneficial for our temporal convnet , so we are planning to train it on large video datasets , such as the recently released collection of  @xcite .",
    "this , however , poses a significant challenge on its own due to the gigantic amount of training data ( multiple tbs ) .",
    "there still remain some essential ingredients of the state - of - the - art shallow representation  @xcite , which are missed in our current architecture .",
    "the most prominent one is local feature pooling over spatio - temporal tubes , centered at the trajectories .",
    "even though the input   captures the optical flow along the trajectories , the spatial pooling in our network does not take the trajectories into account .",
    "another potential area of improvement is explicit handling of camera motion , which in our case is compensated by mean displacement subtraction .",
