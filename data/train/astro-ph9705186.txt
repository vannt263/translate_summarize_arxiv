    "inset  ( b ) shows the advance of the h - shell during this evolution .",
    "simultaneously , the star is expanding and the outer layers become convective . as the star reaches the hayashi limit ( @xmath3 point 7 ) , convection extends quite deeply inward ( in mass ) from the surface , and the star ascends the ( first ) red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "the convective envelope penetrates into the region where partial h - burning has occurred earlier in the evolution , as shown in inset  ( c ) of figure  [ f : lattboot : m1evoln ] .",
    "this material is still mostly  h , but with added @xmath2he  together with the products of cn cycling , primarily @xmath4n and  @xmath5c .",
    "these are now mixed to the surface ( point  8) ; this phase is known as the `` _ first dredge - up _ '' .",
    "the most important surface abundance changes are an increase in the @xmath2he  mass fraction by  @xmath6 ( for masses @xmath7 ) , while @xmath4n  increases at the expense of @xmath8c by  @xmath9% , and the number ratio @xmath8c/@xmath5c  drops from its initial value of  @xmath10 to lie between 18 and 26  @xcite .",

    "helium burning increases the mass fraction of @xmath8c and  @xmath11o ( the latter through @xmath8c@xmath12o ) and the outer regions of the convective core become stable to the schwarzschild convection criterion but unstable to that of ledoux :  a situation referred to as `` semiconvection '' ( space prohibits a discussion of this phenomenon , but an excellent physical description is contained in  @xcite ) .",
    "the semiconvection causes the composition profile to adjust itself to produce convective neutrality , with the resulting profiles as shown in inset  ( e ) of figure  [ f : lattboot : m1evoln ] .",

    "this structure is shown in inset  ( f ) in figure  [ f : lattboot : m1evoln ] .",
    "we will later see that the @xmath2he - shell is thermally unstable , as witnessed by the recurring `` thermal pulses '' .",

    "a more massive star , say of @xmath14 , begins its life very similarly to the lower mass star discussed above .",
    "the main initial difference is that the higher temperature in the core causes cno cycling to be the main source of h - burning , and the high temperature dependence of these reactions causes a convective core to develop .",
    "as h is burned into @xmath2he the opacity ( mainly owing to electron scattering , and hence proportional to the h content ) decreases and the extent of the convective core decreases with time .",
    "this corresponds to points 14 in figure  [ f : lattboot : m5evoln ] .",
    "following core h  exhaustion there is a phase of shell burning as the star crosses the hertzsprung gap ( points 57 and inset  ( b ) ) , and then ascends the ( first ) giant branch . again",
    "the inward penetration of the convective envelope ( point 8) reaches regions where there has been partial h - burning earlier in the evolution , and thus these products ( primarily @xmath5c  and @xmath4n , produced at the cost of @xmath8c ) are mixed to the surface in the first dredge - up , just as seen at lower masses , and sketched in inset  ( c ) of figure  [ f : lattboot : m5evoln ] .",
    "-1.1 true in    for these more massive stars the ignition of @xmath2he  occurs in the centre and under non - degenerate conditions , and the star settles down to a period of quiescent @xmath2he - burning in a convective core , together with h - burning in a shell ( see inset  ( d ) in figure  [ f : lattboot : m5evoln ] ) . the competition between these two energy sources determines the occurrence and extent of the subsequent blueward excursion in the hr diagram  @xcite , when the star crosses the instability strip and is observed as a cepheid variable ( points 1014 ) . following core @xmath2he  exhaustion , the structural re - adjustment to shell @xmath2he burning results in a strong expansion , and the h - shell is extinguished as the star begins its ascent of the agb . with",
    "this entropy barrier removed , the inner edge of the convective envelope is free to penetrate the inactive h - shell ; the products of complete h - burning are mixed to the surface in `` _ second dredge - up _ '' ( point  15 ) .",
    "this again alters the surface compositions of @xmath2he , @xmath8c , @xmath5c , and  @xmath4n , and reduces the mass of the h - exhausted core , ( the process of mixing @xmath2he  outward also mixes h  inward : see inset  ( e ) in fig .",
    "[ f : lattboot : m5evoln ] ) .",
    "there is a critical mass ( of @xmath15 , but dependent on composition ) below which the second dredge - up does not occur . following second dredge - up ,",
    "the h - shell is re - ignited , and the first thermal pulse occurs soon after :  the star has reached the thermally - pulsing agb , or tp - agb . note that at this stage the structure is qualitatively similar for all masses .",
    "as we saw above , when a star approaches the rgb after the completion of main sequence core h - burning , its convective envelope deepens , eventually dredging up products of partial h - burning ( _ first dredge - up _ ) .",
    "the first dredge - up ceases when the convective envelope reaches its maximum inward penetration , and then recedes again .",
    "this leaves behind a sharp composition discontinuity .",
    "for low mass stars ( @xmath16 ) , the h - burning shell catches up to and erases this discontinuity while the star is still on the rgb ; for higher masses , the star leaves the rgb before this can take place .",
    "there is observational evidence from surface abundance changes on the rgb   ( see section  [ s : lattboot : dr12 ] ) that , once the composition discontinuity is erased , some form of non - convective `` _ extra mixing _ '' takes place , which transports material from the ( relatively cool ) bottom of the convective envelope down close to the h - burning shell ( where nuclear burning can alter its composition ) and then up to be mixed back into the convective envelope .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite referred to this process as `` _ cool bottom processing _ '' ; the mixing mechanism is not well understood , but is frequently assumed to be rotation - induced , e.g. , meridional circulation  @xcite and/or shear - induced turbulence  @xcite ( similar to the extra mixing process on the main sequence that yields large @xmath17li - depletions in @xmath1 stars  @xcite ) .",
    "note that `` extra mixing '' or `` extra deep mixing '' generally result in `` cool bottom processing '' and hence in surface abundance changes ; these three terms are used essentially synonymously hereafter .",
    "low mass stars experience significant mass loss on the rgb ( totaling @xmath18 ) , with peak mass loss rates of @xmath19/yr near the tip of the  rgb ; some grain formation may take place during this stage .",
    "after the completion of core he - burning , helium burns in a shell surrounding the degenerate carbon ",
    "oxygen core ; the star ascends the agb , and the convective envelope deepens again . in intermediate mass stars , the h - burning shell is temporarily extinguished and envelope convection reaches into and below the position of the h - shell , bringing more nucleosynthesized material to the surface ( _ second dredge - up _ ) .",
    "this occurs on the early agb ( e - agb ) .",
    "afterwards , the h - shell re - ignites , and periodic thermal pulses ( or helium shell flashes ) occur  the thermally - pulsing agb , or tp - agb ( see section  [ s : lattboot : tpagb ] ) .",
    "the strong nuclear energy generation in these thermal pulses causes a convective region to grow outwards from the he - burning shell , mixing the products of partial he - burning ( mostly @xmath20c ) and of neutron - capture nucleosynthesis ( `` @xmath21-process isotopes '' ) outwards almost to the base of the h - burning shell .",
    "subsequently , the convective envelope reaches into the intershell region where the products of he - burning were deposited and mixes them to the surface ( _ third dredge - up _ : see section  [ s : lattboot : tdu ] ) . note that the third dredge - up is a repeating phenomenon , occurring after almost every pulse ( except for the first few )",
    "this is in contrast to the first and second dredge - up events , which occur at most once per star ( low mass stars do not experience the second dredge - up at all ) .    in stars with masses @xmath22 ,",
    "the convective envelope is deep enough during the long interpulse periods that it reaches into the h - burning shell , i.e. , nuclear processing takes place at the bottom of the convective envelope , altering its composition .",
    "this is known as `` _ hot bottom burning _ '' ( see section  [ s : lattboot : hbb ] ) .",
    "the agb stage of evolution ends when mass loss has removed almost all of the star s envelope ( the `` planetary nebula '' stage follows ) . in the `` superwind '' which terminates the agb ,",
    "mass loss rates of @xmath23/yr are observed ; such dense outflows from cool stars are favorable sites for grain formation .",

    "the @xmath25-element enhancement at lower metallicity was approximated by setting [ o / fe]@xmath26[fe / h ] for [ fe / h]@xmath27 , and constant [ o / fe]@xmath28 for [ fe / h]@xmath29 ; [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] were taken to be independent of metallicity , as indicated by observations ( see timmes _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the initial isotopic ratios @xmath20c/@xmath30c , @xmath31o/@xmath32o , and @xmath31o/@xmath33o were taken to be inversely proportional to fe / h , as suggested by the galactic chemical evolution models of timmes _ et al .",

    "reimers - formula red giant mass loss  @xcite had negligible effect , as very little mass had been lost at the time of first dredge - up ( or at the time of second dredge - up , in intermediate mass stars ) .",
    "models of `` extra mixing '' and the consequent cool bottom processing on the rgb   generally contain free parameter(s ) to control the depth and/or speed of the mixing , whose values may be determined by matching observed rgb stellar compositions .",
    "models presented in this work  @xcite use a simple `` conveyor - belt '' circulation scenario , where the extra mixing reaches down into the outer wing of the h - burning shell .",
    "the temperature difference @xmath38 between the bottom of mixing and the bottom of the h - burning shell was considered a free parameter ( with a value @xmath39 obtained by requiring a @xmath24 , @xmath40 case to reproduce the average observed @xmath20c/@xmath30c ratio ) .",
    "changes in the envelope structure were followed as the star climbs the rgb , by using the structure from a stellar evolutionary run without extra mixing ( as the effect of the extra mixing on the envelope structure should be small ) . for carbon and heavier elements ,",
    "the speed of circulation is irrelevant within wide limits ( a larger number of rapid circulation passes has the same effect as a smaller number of slow ones ; note that if a diffusive approach to mixing had been used , as by denissenkov & weiss  @xcite , then the choice of the speed of mixing would have had a greater effect on the nucleosynthesis ) .",
    "charbonnel  @xcite has attempted to go one step beyond parameterized models such as the one described above , by basing models of extra rgb mixing on zahn s  @xcite prescription for transport of chemicals and angular momentum in rotating stars that are losing angular momentum due to a stellar wind .",
    "@xcite approach is similar to that of pinsonneault  @xcite , assuming a reasonable functional form for the mixing instabilities and parameterizing them in terms of a few adjustable parameters .",
    "however , rather than treating all transport as diffusive , zahn assumes that meridional circulation can transport both chemicals and angular momentum , but that shear instabilities lead to largely horizontal turbulence , homogenizing the star at each radial layer and thus converting the transport of chemicals to a much slower diffusive process with diffusion constant @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , @xmath43  is the local angular velocity , @xmath44  is the rate of loss of angular momentum due to a stellar wind , and @xmath45  is an adjustable parameter@xmath46  on the main sequence , zahn  @xcite estimates @xmath47 from the observed extent of solar lithium depletion .",

    "the mixing was assumed to reach down to the `` top of the h - burning shell ''  @xcite , presumably determined by the stabilizing effect of the molecular weight gradient  @xcite in the outer wing of the h - burning shell .",
    "whether the above assumptions , and zahn s parameterization of rotational mixing itself , are appropriate on the rgb can only be determined by comparison with the observations , as he noted himself  @xcite .",

    "below , most of the @xmath20c and  @xmath30c have been converted into  @xmath60n , @xmath33o has been destroyed , and  @xmath32o  begins to be enhanced from partial burning of  @xmath31o .    as the @xmath30c - pocket is engulfed by the convective envelope , the surface @xmath20c/@xmath30c ratio is reduced from its large initial value ( @xmath10 for solar compositions ) to  @xmath9 in low mass stars and somewhat less ( @xmath61 ) in intermediate mass stars ( see theoretical curves of fig .",
    "[ f : lattboot : dr12varcrat ] ) .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ f : lattboot : dr12varcrat ] , observations of rgb and post - rgb @xmath20c/@xmath30c ratios in galactic open clusters  @xcite indicate the an increasing trend with stellar mass , not a decreasing one .",
    "gilroy & brown  @xcite observed @xmath20c/@xmath30c ratios as a function of luminosity on the rgb .",
    "they found that observed and theoretical ratios agree very well up to and somewhat past the point of deepest first dredge - up , but that excess @xmath30c began to appear after the point where the h - burning shell reached the composition discontinuity that was left behind by deepest first dredge - up .",
    "as discussed by charbonnel  @xcite , this is consistent with cool bottom processing due to relatively slow ( weak ) extra mixing , because the mixing instability can be stabilized by a molecular weight gradient : the large molecular weight gradient at the composition discontinuity acts as a barrier to mixing .",
    "once the h - burning shell has reached ( and erased ) the composition discontinuity , the extra mixing can transport envelope material down into the outer wing of the h - burning shell , where h - burning produces a molecular weight gradient ( how deep into the shell the mixing would reach is determined by the details of the mixing mechanism , but can be estimated by the observed nucleosynthetic results at the stellar surface ) . for stars of mass @xmath62 , the end of the rgb occurs before the composition discontinuity has been erased ; thus these intermediate - mass stars do not encounter rgb cool bottom processing .    in figure",
    "[ f : lattboot : dr12crat ] , the solid lines show theoretical predictions of the @xmath20c/@xmath30c ratio resulting from first dredge - up , as a function of stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "the trend with stellar mass is due to the fact that low mass stars have narrower @xmath30c - pockets than intermediate mass stars ( the entire @xmath30c - pocket is always dredged up ) .",
    "the trend of increased @xmath20c/@xmath30c ratio for reduced metallicity  @xmath63 is due to the fact that the initial stellar @xmath20c/@xmath30c ratio was assumed to be inversely proportional to fe / h  @xcite ; models where the initial stellar @xmath20c/@xmath30c ratio was assumed to be independent of metallicity show a very small trend in the opposite direction ( see also charbonnel  @xcite ) .",
    "the average observed @xmath20c/@xmath30c ratios in rgb and post - rgb stars , in galactic open clusters of near - solar metallicity , are shown by the open circles in figure  [ f : lattboot : dr12crat ] ; for stars of mass @xmath62 , they are in reasonable agreement with the theoretical curves , ( although they suggest that the @xmath30c - pocket may in fact be about 20% smaller than predicted by standard theoretical models ) . for stars of mass @xmath64 ,",
    "the observations reflect the `` extra mixing '' and cool bottom processing that produces additional @xmath30c subsequent to first dredge - up .",

    "the depth of the extra mixing in the models is determined by the observed @xmath20c/@xmath30c ratio in stars of mass @xmath40 , and thus by definition the cool bottom processing models reproduce that observational point . as expected , given the normalization at  @xmath40 , they also reproduce the trend with stellar mass shown by the observations of stars with masses between 1.2 and  @xmath65 . under the assumption that extra mixing always reaches the same point in the outer wing of the h - burning shell , independent of metallicity , figure  [ f : lattboot : dr12crat ] shows that cool bottom processing has a much greater effect on low metallicity ( population  ii ) stars than in stars of near - solar metallicity ( population  i ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that cno - cycle burning proceeds at higher temperatures in the h - shell of a low metallicity star , to compensate for the reduced cno abundance .",
    "if anything , these cool bottom processing models underestimate the effect of metallicity , as discussed below .",

    "a decline in @xmath57he ( not observable ) and in @xmath17li ( consistent with observations ) was also reported  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively correct , but a quantitative test of the model would require consideration of population  i stars , or of more diagnostic isotopes for such population  ii stars , e.g. , total carbon or oxygen abundances , or heavier elements such as sodium , magnesium , and aluminum , whose observed behavior on the rgb is discussed below .",
    "low mass stars ( @xmath67 ) , which develop a degenerate helium core , experience a lengthy rgb stage with significant cool bottom processing before the violent ignition of core helium , in the `` helium core flash '' ; stars of higher mass ignite helium quiescently in a non - degenerate core , and experience only a brief rgb stage , with no opportunity for cool bottom processing . in the models of boothroyd & sackmann  @xcite ,",
    "population  ii stars of mass @xmath22 ignite core helium before they ever reach the rgb , and thus experience no first dredge - up at all ( see the @xmath53 case of fig .  [",

    "whether this `` early '' core helium ignition actually occurs in higher mass population  ii stars is not certain : the corresponding models of charbonnel  @xcite show only slightly shallower first dredge - up than population  i stars , while the corresponding models of lattanzio  @xcite show intermediate behavior .",
    "the exact point of core helium ignition in these stars thus appears to be sensitive to details of the physical inputs and/or numerical treatment of the stellar models ( as are the form and extent of the `` cepheid loops '' experienced by intermediate mass stars during core he - burning ) . however , any resulting uncertainties in the surface composition are wiped out by second dredge - up on the e - agb .    as helium begins to burn in a shell surrounding a degenerate carbon ",
    "oxygen core , the star begins to climb the agb and the convective envelope deepens . in low mass stars ,",
    "the convective envelope does not reach as deep as the h - burning shell , and thus mixes matter that was already homogenized by first dredge - up ; the surface composition thus changes very little . in intermediate mass stars ,",
    "the h - burning shell is extinguished on the e - agb and second dredge - up reaches down into the h - exhausted material left behind by the h - burning shell .",
    "there almost all the cno isotopes have been converted into @xmath60n , so dredge - up of this material has little effect on the @xmath20c/@xmath30c ratio ( see dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ f : lattboot : dr12crat ] ) .",
    "however , if first dredge - up has not yet mixed the @xmath30c - pocket to the surface ( as may be the case in high mass population  ii stars ) , second dredge - up will do so .",
    "since second dredge - up in intermediate mass stars occurs before any significant amount of mass loss , the composition of the material injected into the interstellar medium is not affected by any uncertainty in first dredge - up for population  ii stars .    the envelope @xmath60n/@xmath58n ratio is increased from @xmath68 to @xmath69 by first and/or second dredge - up  @xcite , due to the engulfing of @xmath58n - depleted , @xmath60n - enriched material . however , any cool bottom processing that significantly affects the @xmath20c/@xmath30c ratio should also destroy almost all the @xmath58n in the star s envelope ( yielding the nuclear equilibrium ratio @xmath60n/@xmath58n@xmath70 ) .",

    "these models agree with observations of population  ii field stars and of some globular clusters ( e.g. , m4 , 47  tuc , ngc  3201 , ngc  2298 , ngc  288 ) , which show no oxygen depletion ( see , e.g. , kraft  @xcite , and references therein ) . on the other hand ,",

    "a change in the normalization of extra mixing , i.e. , deeper mixing ( down to hotter temperatures ) , would produce the observed oxygen depletions ( as well as the anti - correlation of o with na and al also observed in some globular clusters ) , as shown by the higher - temperature models computed by denissenkov & weiss  @xcite ; they found , however , that such models could not simultaneously match the carbon observations ( too much carbon was destroyed ) .",

    "a similar conclusion follows from the models of langer _",

    "note that the oxygen - depletion and na - al observations require that , in some stars , extra mixing must reach temperatures corresponding to those at the _ bottom _ of the h - burning shell in standard stellar models . in a case without extra mixing , o depletion and na production can take place just outside the burning shell ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , but when extra mixing is present higher temperatures are needed to deplete o significantly over the entire envelope on the rgb timescale  @xcite .",

    "the agb phase terminates when mass loss has reduced the star s envelope mass almost to zero . in the calculations presented below we used the mass loss formula of vassiliadis & wood  @xcite ,",
    "although there are other formulations and the number of thermal pulses , hbb nucleosynthesis , and final stellar mass depend sensitively on this rather uncertain input ( see also  ) .",
    "the other main sources of uncertainty in agb evolution are possible errors in low - temperature molecular opacities  @xcite , and uncertainties in the treatment of convective mixing ( see section  [ s : lattboot : tdu ] ) .",
    "-0.71 true in    the repeated operation of the thermal pulse cycle described above is responsible for the periodic addition of carbon to the stellar surface .",

    "however , please refer to  @xcite .",
    "neutron capture nucleosynthesis in agb stars is well known , both observationally and theoretically .",
    "we now believe that the neutron source active in these stars ( at least the lower masses ) is @xmath5c .",
    "but how exactly does this @xmath5c arise ?",
    "this remains a serious problem for the models , which do not exhibit the required @xmath5c production . while it is true that some @xmath5c is produced by cno cycling in the h - shell , this is nowhere near enough to produce the neutron exposures inferred from observations of these stars .",
    "we will make an _ ad hoc _ assumption that some kind of extra mixing takes place at the bottom of the convective envelope during the dredge - up phase .",
    "this has indeed been found in one of the models of iben & renzini  @xcite , but has not been reproduced by their subsequent models  @xcite , nor by the models of other authors .",
    "however , such partial mixing at the base of the envelope convective arises naturally from hydrodynamic simulations of overshoot below a convective region   ( and with a parameterization of such an overshoot model , herwig _ et al . _",
    "@xcite did indeed find that a @xmath30c - pocket was produced ) . assuming that such mixing does indeed occur",
    ", small amounts of hydrogen are mixed into a region which is relatively rich in @xmath8c . during the subsequent interpulse phase",
    ", these regions heat and the protons are captured by the @xmath8c to produce @xmath5c .",
    "( it is crucial that there is not too much hydrogen in this region , or all the @xmath5c will be burned to @xmath4n . )",
    "this `` @xmath5c - pocket '' was initially believed to sit in the star and wait until the next thermal pulse , when it would be engulfed by the intershell convection .",
    "the high temperatures present would then release the neutrons and the @xmath21-processing would occur in the convective intershell region .",
    "but it has been shown recently ( straniero _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , followed by  @xcite ) that the temperatures in the intershell are sufficiently high ( i.e. , the interpulse duration is sufficiently long ) that almost all of the @xmath5c burns to @xmath11o there , releasing the neutrons locally and thus resulting in @xmath21-processing _ in situ _ with large neutron exposures .",
    "later , when this region is mixed into the flash - driven convection zone , the results of the neutron captures are also mixed into the convective zone .",
    "this situation is shown schematically in figure  [ f : lattboot : c13pocket ] .",
    "a brief pulse of neutrons from the @xmath91ne neutron source , at the peak of the shell flash , may redistribute @xmath21-process yields somewhat in the flash - driven convection zone .",
    "the details of the @xmath21-processing are covered in the excellent review by gallino & busso  @xcite ; @xmath21-process models ( parameterized by the size of the @xmath30c - pocket ) can yield a good match with observed @xmath21-process abundances .",
    "the nucleosynthesis described above results in changes in the photospheric composition because of the operation of the third dredge - up .",
    "yet there are several details concerning this mechanism which are not well understood .",
    "one usually applies the schwarzschild criterion to determine the convective boundary .",
    "this relies on finding the position where the acceleration of gas eddies is zero , which is where @xmath104 .",
    "convective eddies will still have a non - zero momentum when they reach this boundary , and hence they will penetrate into the radiatively stable region where they are decelerated to zero velocity ( `` _ convective overshoot _ '' ) .",
    "but for third dredge - up , the boundary is even more prone to mixing .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath105 ( at the bottom of the convective envelope ) exceeds unity substantially , and hence a finite buoyancy will drive eddies into the stable region .",
    "exactly how the star will mix , to achieve the expected convective neutrality , is uncertain .",
    "it is , of course , a hydrodynamical problem .",
    "we expect the convective region to grow into the intershell region , until the gradients smoothly approach each other . from this configuration",
    "we would still expect the usual overshoot .",
    "this situation has been investigated in some detail by  @xcite who found that the depth of dredge - up depends critically on assumptions made at the boundary of the convective region , as well as on the way in which the mixing is handled within the evolutionary calculation ( e.g. , if the mixing is performed after each iteration , or only after a model has converged ) ; increasing the number of mass zones and time steps in the model can also have a significant effect  @xcite .",
    "current work in progress has shown that the depth of dredge - up dramatically alters the evolution of the star .",
    "deep dredge - up cools the intershell region , and slows the advance of the he - shell to almost zero , yielding almost stationary shell burning .",
    "the depth of the dredge - up depends also on the treatment of the entropy cost of mixing dense material upward in a gravitational field  @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of stellar convection in 2-d and 3-d have been used in attempts to parameterize the extent of overshoot below a convective envelope that results from the downward plumes typically found in such simulations ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite applied the overshoot parameterization of  @xcite to all boundaries of all convective regions , finding significant effects on thermal pulse nucleosynthesis and dredge - up .",
    "we have much to learn about this complicated phase of evolution , and work is continuing .",
    "hot bottom burning ( hereafter `` hbb '' ) is the colourful name given to the circumstance where the temperature at the bottom of a star s convective envelope is sufficiently high for nucleosynthesis to take place .",
    "it is perhaps better to think of this as the bottom of the convective envelope penetrating into the top of the h - burning shell .",
    "it is also sometimes known as `` convective envelope burning '' or simply `` envelope burning '' .",
    "the first calculations of hbb were performed by sackmann _",
    "_  @xcite and scalo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ; for a discussion of the development and history of this phenomenon , please see  @xcite .",
    "it is only relatively recently that stellar models have shown deep convective envelopes with temperatures exceeding 80 million degrees@xcite in a thin region at their base .",
    "indeed , it was noticed by@xcite that this resulted in the star no longer obeying the luminosity relation , but space prevents us from going into details here ( see @xcite for more information ) .",
    "the first effect of hbb is the production of @xmath106li via the cameron - fowler beryllium transport mechanism .",
    "the first systematic studies of this were carried out by  @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient is an algorithm for time - dependent mixing because it is essential that the timescale for mixing be much shorter than the electron - capture lifetime for @xmath106be ( instantaneous mixing would decrease  @xmath106li ! ) .",
    "sackmann & boothroyd  @xcite showed that @xmath106li was produced when the temperature  @xmath107 at the bottom of the convective envelope exceeded @xmath108k , with abundances up to @xmath109li@xmath110 in stars with @xmath111 to  @xmath112 ( note that @xmath109li@xmath113li@xmath114h@xmath115 ) ; similar results ( with slightly higher peak lithium abundances ) were obtained in hbb models of forestini & charbonnel  @xcite .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the observations   which show magellanic cloud agb stars of @xmath116 between @xmath117 and @xmath112 to have @xmath109li@xmath103 in the range @xmath118 to  @xmath119 , and galactic agb stars with @xmath109li@xmath120 .",
    "one of the main effects of hbb is to take the @xmath8c which is dredged to the surface and process it into @xmath4n via the cn cycle .",
    "some @xmath5c will also be produced , but the overall carbon destruction prevents the star from becoming a carbon star .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite )",
    ". significant destruction of @xmath8c together with production of @xmath5c and @xmath4n requires temperatures of at least @xmath121k .",
    "this was found for masses greater than @xmath122 to  @xmath123 , depending on the metallicity ( increasing as @xmath63 increases ) .",
    "these authors expect a maximum luminosity of @xmath124 for carbon stars , as higher luminosities will result in hbb processing the @xmath8c into  @xmath4n . despite the narrowness of the burning layer ,",
    "the mixing timescale is such that the entire envelope is processed through the burning region many times during the interpulse phase , and the nuclear equilibrium ratio @xmath8c@xmath125c@xmath126 ( by number ) is reached for stars with @xmath127 .",
    "thus there is a narrow region ( in luminosity ) where stars may be rich in  @xmath5c , prior to further processing of  @xmath8c ( and  @xmath5c ) into  @xmath4n .",
    "the situation with oxygen isotopes is a little more complicated .",
    "the third dredge - up appears to have a negligible effect on the oxygen isotopes , but hbb initially destroys any @xmath128o which is present , and then follows this by producing some @xmath129o  @xcite .",
    "the complication comes from the fact that many agb stars do not seem to fit this pattern .",
    "this is despite the fact that extremely precise meteoritic grain analysis  @xcite reveals isotopic ratios which do fit the results of standard first and second dredge - up models quite well ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it now appears that to match the observations of s and c stars we may need to invoke some form of `` deep extra mixing '' during the agb evolution ( possibly in addition to the first ascent of the giant branch , as discussed in section  [ s : lattboot : dr12 ] ) .",
    "we mentioned above @xmath130f enrichment from third dredge - up .",
    "if a star is massive enough for hbb to develop , then any @xmath130f added to its envelope is destroyed by @xmath130f@xmath131o . thus stars with enhanced @xmath130f",
    "are presumably lower - mass stars , where hbb does not take place .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that they are often carbon stars too .",
    "but more can be learned from  @xmath130f . to produce",
    "the largest observed enhancements of  @xmath130f seems to require a substantial source of  @xmath5c  @xcite , just as is needed for the @xmath21-process abundances .    of particular interest to us at this meeting",
    "is the production of @xmath132al in agb stars . during hot h - burning",
    "there is some production of @xmath132al from the mg - al reaction chains .",
    "this was studied by  @xcite who looked into the dredge - up of any @xmath132al produced by the h - shell .",
    "they found that enhancements of @xmath132al could occur , with @xmath132al/@xmath133al@xmath134 , reproducing the mean observed isotopic ratios .",
    "but to obtain the large enhancements required by some grains would require dredge - up to occur when the stellar envelope mass was very small ( thus minimizing the dilution of the dredged - up material ) . yet the dredge - up stops when the envelope mass decreases too much ( the critical envelope mass for dredge - up is very uncertain ) .",
    "an alternative scenario is that hbb will produce @xmath132al in the stellar envelope during the interpulse period .",
    "we close now with some preliminary calculations of hbb from  @xcite .",
    "the calculations are for @xmath135 models with three compositions , appropriate to the sun ( @xmath136 ) , the large magellanic cloud ( @xmath137 ) and the small magellanic cloud ( @xmath138 ) .",

    "the details of the surface composition in the latter stages of a star s life depend critically on the competition between these effects ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we find that dredge - up is still strong at the 43rd pulse ( when the mass has been reduced to @xmath146 ) when we stopped calculations .",
