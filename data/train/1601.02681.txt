    "fibrous media display different degrees of meso - scale variability from ideal fibre paths .",
    "this can be due to the manufacturing of the reinforcement , handling and preparing the moulding step .",
    "resin flow inside porous media is influenced by fibres spatial variability and heterogeneity , and neglecting this causes errors in process analysis and uncertainty in measurement .",
    "thus a reliable model of fluid flow in heterogeneous media must include multiscale phenomena and capture the multiscale nature of fluid transport behaviour , at microscale , mesoscale and macroscale . in the sense the dominant processes and governing equations may vary with scales . therefore , extending from microscale level to a mesoscale one needs upscaling that allows the essence of physical processes at one level to be summarized at the larger level .",
    "however , a detailed understaning of upscaling process from microscale to mesocale has not been completed .",
    "mesoscopic and macroscopic properties of fibrous media such as porosity , fibre size distribution and permeability can be characterized through lab - scale methods while the microscale properties are uncaptured .",
    "the lack of ability for measurements on the microscale can lead to uncertainty in interpretations of the data captured at macroscale .",
    "a major challenge arising from this non homogeneity is how macroscale flow is influenced by the microscale structure ( pore spaces ) , as well as by the physical properties of the resin .",
    "permeability is an important macroscale variable representing average of microscale properties of porous media .",
    "this average permeability is the fundamental property arising from dracy s law ( [ eq.darcy ] ) : [ eq.darcy ] = .p , which describes the relation between the volume averaged fluid velocity ,  , the pressure gradient , @xmath0p , the fluid s viscosity , @xmath1 , and the equivalent permeability tensor k. empirical equations , such as kozeny@xmath2carmen ( [ eq.kozeny ] ) , have been developed to relate the meso - scale permeability with the microscale properties , including porosity : [ eq.kozeny ] k=.here @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is porosity , @xmath6 is fibre radius , @xmath7 is kozeny constant , @xmath8 is tortuosity , @xmath9 is the length of streamlines , l is the length of sample and c is a proportionality constant @xcite .    because the nonhomogeneous nature of porous media originates in the randomness of fibre diameter distributions , porosities and pore structure , permeability is subjected to uncertainty @xcite .",
    "causes and effects of this uncertainty have been reviewed @xcite , assuming a normal @xcite and a lognormal permeability probability density function @xcite , previous studies have modeled the effect of this uncertainty on fluid flow in porous media by employing stochastic analysis .",
    "considered as a vast area in stochastic processes , such analyzes require to identify the sources of uncertainties and to select probabilistic methods for uncertainty propagation up to different modeling levels .",
    "+ in simulation of mould filling process , such as resin transfer moulding , which are described by dracy s law ( [ eq.darcy ] ) , permeability directly affects filling time and flow pattern .",
    "an accurate probability density function for permeability is therefore vital for reliable simulations . a number of studies @xcite have used a normal probability density functions for experimentally determined permeability at macroscale .",
    "but their measurements have been mostly for small sample sizes and hence may still be the subject to experimental and statistical inaccuracy .",
    "in other words , data obtained from the experiments may not be enough to choose between two ( normal or lognormal distribution ) or more competing distribution functions .",
    "furthermore , these studies ignore the effect of microscale uncertainties on macroscale permeability uncertainties .",
    "+ different approximation methods have been used to determine the impact of microscale uncertainties on macroscale permeability uncertainties , e.g , finite element based monte carlo and lattice - boltzmann methods have been used to estimate permeability and superficial velocity of representative volume elements of porous media @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the analytical methods has been debated because they have considered homogeneous periodic arrays of parallel fibres instead of random distributions .",
    "in addition , all of the modeling approaches require that either the distribution of at least one property of fibrous media or the distribution of macropors of fibrous media be known .",
    "another criticism is that estimating permeability by curve fitting with empirical constants is known to generate significant systematic errors .",
    "+ in view of the fact that finding an appropriate distribution function describing the spatial variation of permeability in fibrous media is a challenging problem .",
    "therefore , a method that measures the microstructural variability as input for stochastic simulations is required . in the @xcite , we analyzed the effect of tortuosity on the variability of permeability at the average local fibre volume fraction(microscale level ) .",
    "we showed that the gaussian distribution is not necessarily the most appropriate distribution for representing permeability @xcite . in this study",
    ", we capture the influence of a distribution of local fibre volume fraction ( @xmath5 ) on the variability of permeability . the uncertainty in this variable ( e.g,@xmath5 ) propagates to a larger level and is reflected in the variability of the geometry of flow affecting the final quality of composites .",
    "in order to establish a probability density function for permeability , in this study we propose that ( i ) the best probability density function may be approximated for distribution of fibre volume fraction by a normal model , ( ii ) the values of fibre volume fraction were used to compute the distribution of permeability applying the kozeny - carmen equation , ( iii ) we used the kozeny - carmen equation together with change of variable technique to determine the probability density function of permeability and subsequently the analytical approach is compared with the distribution of permeability @xcite ( figure  [ fig : flowchart1 ] ) .",
    "there is no universal established relationship between fibre volume fraction and permeability . in this paper",
    "we recall the carmen kozeny equation in order to find the pdf of permeability ( [ eq.kozeny ] ) .",
    "observe that in ( [ eq.kozeny ] ) the random variable ( rv ) @xmath10 is an increasing function of porosity @xmath5 ( assuming @xmath11 , @xmath12 are constant ) , see figure  [ change ] .",
    "note also that @xmath10 is significantly affected by @xmath11 . however",
    "this will not be addressed in this paper .",
    "here we use change - of - variables technique , in this study called `` the change of @xmath5 '' , to investigate pdfs of permeability .",
    "this technique is a common and well - known way of finding the pdf of @xmath13 if @xmath14 be a continuous random variable with a probability density function @xmath15 .",
    "therefore to establish the pdf of random variable @xmath10 , it is required to have the pdf of @xmath5 . thus subsequently in the next section ,",
    "we determine numerically the pdf of @xmath5 .    ]",
    "variable fibre volume fraction for a fibrous media depends on areal weight density ( @xmath16 ) and thickness(t ) and can be expressed as equation ( [ eq.poro ] ) : [ eq.poro ] v_f= where @xmath17 stands the fibre density , n is number of layers . to attain a closed form expression of the density of @xmath18 ,",
    "both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are considered normal random variables with correlation coefficient , -1<@xmath21<1 .",
    "when @xmath21=0 , the two variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 are independent , the distribution of @xmath18 would have a cauchy distribution .",

    "now denote @xmath34 , @xmath35 as the standard deviation of rvs @xmath19 , @xmath28 and moreover @xmath21 as their correlation coefficient and their relationship can be expressed as : [ eq.stan ] cov(a_w , t)=(a_w)(t)_corr.in addition we define the coefficient of variation ( @xmath36 ) of a rv , such as @xmath37 :    cv(v_f)= [ eq.cvvv ] consequently eqn .",
    "( [ eq.var.1 ] ) can be recast as : ^2(v_f)(_v_f)^2(cv^2(a_w)-2cv(a_w)cv(t)a_w_corr+cv^2(t))[eq.var.2]consider ( [ eq.var.2 ] ) and replace it in ( [ eq.cvvv ] ) , then the @xmath36 of fibre volume fraction yields : cv(v_f ) [ eq.var.3]equation ( [ eq.var.3 ] ) shows that the @xmath36 of rv fibre volume fraction@xmath38 is approximately independent from @xmath39 .",
    "owing to ( [ eq.var.3 ] ) at point @xmath40 , evidently 3d scatter plots ( [ fig : hhh ] ) exhibits variation of the @xmath36 of the rv fibre volume fraction @xmath38 as a function of the coefficient of variations thickness @xmath41 and local areal density @xmath42 .",
    "+    in figure [ fig : hhh ] , it is possible to observe that when @xmath21 increases from zero to one , a saddel is formed with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and then @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig : hhh ] shows that as @xmath42 and @xmath41 approach each other too closely , @xmath37 moves from the top to the lowest level .",
    "+ as to the pdf of @xmath5 , section 2.1.1 establises experimentally that the random variable @xmath5 has normal distribution .",
    "although by calling the following cases we claim that this assertion in independent case is not theoretically artificial :    * @xmath19 and @xmath28 are * independent*. it is straightforward that when a random variable @xmath28 follows cauchy distribution with parameter @xmath46 then @xmath47 has also cauchy distribution with parameter @xmath48 .",
    "further , according to our explanation above , we can easily check that the ratio of two independent normal random variables determines the cauchy pdf .",
    "hence as result if we consider random variables @xmath19 and @xmath28 takes normal and cauchy distributions respectively then @xmath5 has normal pdf . *",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath28 are * dependent*. this case is more complicated but practical .",
    "first note that if one is interested in bivariate normal distribution for pair @xmath49 .",
    "we address to @xcite which study the ratio of two correlated normal random variables .",
    "the author indeed has established that if @xmath19 and @xmath28 be normally distributed random variables with means @xmath50 , variances @xmath51 , @xmath52 and correlated coefficient @xmath21 , then the exact pdf of @xmath5 takes the form ( 1 ) in page 636 in @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we omit the form ( 1 ) here .",
    "however , in @xcite we could observe that in this special case , i.e. normally distributed @xmath49 the pdf of @xmath5 is not necessarily symmetric and normal .",
    "therefore by virtue of author s investigations , it is not clear yet that what kind of distributions should be considered for @xmath49 to prove analytically a normal pdf for @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , the solution which may come cross the mind is experimental results represented in next subsection .",
    "table  [ input ] shows the specifications of a @xmath53 twill carbon woven fabric used for production of composite parts in this study .",
    "the fabric was cut in the warp direction .",

    "full production details have been presented in @xcite .",
    "[ input ]    in order to measure the h of each tow , series of samples were cut perpendicular to the fibre direction , the samples were polished manually in four steps ( sandpaper grits 320 , 400 , 800 , and 1000 ) , and subsequently photographed using an olimpus png3 optical microscope equipped with a ccd camera .",
    "the analysis of each tow is carried out by image processing matlab 2015 . before importing the images into the matlab workspace , arears such as edges or borders which are not in the interest of tow geometry characterizations were cropped . in projective geometry",
    "every tow section is equivallent to an ellipse .",
    "figure [ ellipse]a illustrates how an ellipse is fitted to a tow to locate the center point based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "then the tow thickness ( @xmath28 ) is equivalent to twice the length of the minor radius ( @xmath54 ) ( figure [ ellipse]b ) .",
    "a total of 200 optical images were collected and an ellipse is fitted to each tow .    to determine the @xmath55 of each tow , the area of each tow ( @xmath56 ) in warp direction was approximated by the equivalent ellipse .",
    "then , the number of filaments per tow ( @xmath57 ) were counted .",
    "knowing the radius of the fibre cross section(r ) , length of warp tow ( l ) , and @xmath58 , the @xmath55 of each tow@xmath59 was computed from the following equation ( [ eq.ad ] ) :    = [ eq.ad ]    to determine distribution of @xmath18 , the `` r '' statistical software @xcite was employed .",
    "for each pair ( @xmath20,@xmath19 ) , @xmath18 was computed , afterward a histogram was generated .      a scatter plot of @xmath55 and @xmath20 for each tow is shown in figure [ fig : cv ] .",
    "the coefficient of variation for the data was 0.72 .",
    "an ellipse is fitted to the data .",
    "we can see that the ellipse extends between 100 and 200 @xmath60 on the 45 degree line .",
    "hence @xmath55 and @xmath20 follow a bivariate normal distribution with mean components 168.5 @xmath61 and 102.3 @xmath62 , respectively . therefore ,",
    "our results suggest that @xmath55 and @xmath20 are dependent and can be well approximated by the bivariate normal distribution .        for each pair of @xmath55 and @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath18 was computed .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist1 ] shows that the distribution of the local average fibre volume fraction follows a bell - curve distributions : the distribution of fibre volume fraction values are well approximated with a normal distribution model .",
    "a large distribution of @xmath18 was observed , ranging from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "the graphical analysis indicates the closeness of the local average fibre volume fraction data to the normal distribution with cumulative distribution function(cdf)(figure  [ fig : cdf ] ) .",
    "the cdf plot is following a typical s curve indicative of normal distribution .",
    "it follows from the section of @xmath65 that the fibre volume fraction of a preform , @xmath5 , has a truncated normal pdf , @xmath66 , with mean @xmath1 and variance @xmath67 over @xmath68 $ ] such that @xmath69 : [ pdf.tn ] f^tn(v_f)= , v_f1<v_f < v_f2.in eqn .",

    "( [ pdf.tn ] ) yields the pdf of normal distribution with mean @xmath1 and variance @xmath67 .",

    "note that the second probability derives from the of that @xmath78 is an increasing function of @xmath5 . + consequently by taking the derivative of @xmath79 with respect to @xmath82 , the pdf of rv @xmath10 is obtained by    l f_k(k)=f_k(k)= f_v_f(g^-1(k ) ) + = g^-1(k ) .",
    "f_v_f(g^-1(k ) ) .    introduce @xmath83 and @xmath84 , since @xmath78 is an increasing function then @xmath85 .",

    "k_2 .    as figure [ change ] shows this function is a one to one function so it is invertible .",
    "however , while it may be possible to find a closed form solution to this inverse , we will begin by presenting a numerical solution to this problem .",
    "a summary of statistical properties of permeability for the different cov of @xmath87 is represented in figure  [ fig : cvflow ] .",
    "it is observed that an in - plane distribution of local fibre volume fraction results in a distribution of local permeabilities for flow perpendicular to the plane of the fibrous medium .",
    "it is established in figure  [ fig : cvflow ] that domain with larger local average areal densities possess larger local average permeability values .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained in terms of probability of number of contact points between fibres .",
    "the probability of number of contact points of fibres is larger for the domains with higher local average areal density .",
    "higher contact points means stiffer arrangement of adjacent fibres , causing increased frictional resistance to fluid flow , and hence leading to less permeable area .",
    "furthermore the normalized local average permeability ( i ) initially decreases when @xmath88 increases due to its influence on @xmath37 , ( ii ) subsequently increases due to the increasing influence of @xmath88 on the normalized local average permeability .",
    "therefore , as expected , this implies that the heterogeneity of fibrous media has a significant impact on the magnitude of variation in permeability .",
    "the pdf ( [ eq.k1 ] ) is computed applying monte - carlos simulations ( using the `` r '' statistical software @xcite ) .",
    "monte - carlo simulation was carried out on the domain with a average fibre volume fraction of 0.78 .",
    "subsequently this analytical model fit ( [ eq.k1 ] ) was compared with what would be predicted by physically based permeability equations ( e.g. kozeny - carman([eq.kozeny ] ) ) .",
    "to do so , using the values of @xmath5 computed earlier , the distribution of permeability was obtained in ( [ eq.kozeny ] ) .",
    "then , probability values calculated through ( [ eq.k1 ] ) were fit to permeability values . finally , in order to find the best distribution model to the analytical pdf , different statistical distributions are examined .",
    "+ figure  [ map ] shows , obtained through the method described above , ( i ) the data are not symmetric and skewed to the right , ( ii ) there is significant agreement between the analytical approach and the simulation results of permeability ( kozeny - carmen ) .",
    "the observed skewness in permeability distribution is close to what one was observed in @xcite at macrolevel .",
    "the same principle was applied to various kinds of corrolations between @xmath10 and @xmath5 .",
    "table  [ com ] lists the distribution behaviour of @xmath10 derived from models found in the literature .",
    "the appearance of the distributions presented in table  [ com ] is the same as one shown in figure  [ map ] .",
    "table  [ com ] shows that the skewness of @xmath10 lies between 1.78 - 3.45 , implying non - normal distribution of the permeability .",
    "in addition , the kurtosis values range between 9 and 24 , deviating extremely from normality .",
    "as expected , there is a significant difference between the calculated skewness and kurtosis and that of the normal distribution .",
    "[ com ]    furthermore , figure  [ fa ] illustrates how well the different distributions including normal , lognormal , gamma , and beta fit to the analytical probability function .",
    "it is clear that the normal and beta distributions fail to represent the distribution of permeability values .",
    "figure  [ fa ] also shows a lognormal distribution as well as a gamma distribution provide a good fit for permeability values .",
    "it has been derived that both lognormal and gamma distributions can be used effectively in analyzing a non - negative right - skewed data set @xcite . as shown in figure  [ fa ] , a comparison between the lognormal and gamma distributions reveals that their pdfs have similar results . to find which of these distributions gives better fit to the data ,",
    "we have considered two data transformation methods , one based on the normal approximation to the log of the data set , working on lognormal distributions and the other based on the cube root of the data , working on gamma distribution : if the data looks symmetric after log transformation , the lognormal distribution would work better to represent the variation of the permeability .",
    "if the data looks symmetric after the cube root transformation , the gamma distribution would work better to represent the variation of the permeability @xcite .",
    "according to figure  [ gl ] , although the log transformation seems to fit well in the body of permeability values , the data shows to be left - skewed on log scale .",
    "the significant left - skewed on log scale also is observable on the work of zhang et al.@xcite(see figure  [ zh ] ) , who evaluated the permeability from local areal weight combined with the kozeny - carmen model , suggesting that the lognormal distribution can be used to describe the permeability distribution",
    ".        one final comment on which we would like to conclude this section regards entropy . in the literature",
    "it has been proven that under constraints , known mean and variance , the normal distribution maximizes entropy .",
    "using this principle that maximizes entropy is a selecting factor for a model we calculated the entropy values of the two fits . using straightforward computations we obtain the entropies for lognormal pdf -0.931 and gamma pfd -0.887 , which coincids with the previous result claiming gamma distribution with more entropy determines the permeability data    .      in order to examine the applicability of gamma distributions to other empirical permeability equations ,",
    "these equations are subjected to the kolmogorov - smirnov statistics ( kss ) test for normality in terms of normal , lognormal , gamma , weibull and beta distributions .",
    "if , in the kss test p < 0.05 , there is significant probability of deviation from normality .",
    "the p value computations are listed in table  [ gamma ] .",
    "gamma distribution shows the largest p - values among the given distributions for the different empirical permeability equations .",
    "hence , based on the information in table  [ gamma ] , we conclude that the gamma distribution provides the best fit .",
    "furthermore , it is shown in table  [ gamma ] the permeability covs of all empirical equations range between 0.43 and 0.74 , which is about 8 times larger than the fibre volume fraction cov of 0.086 .",
    "this suggests that permeability is subjected to larger uncertainty than fibre volume fraction .",
    "an adequate representation of microstructural variability of fibre arrangement in fibre - reinforced composites is of critical importance for the analysis of the flow in the fibrous media . the distribution of fibre volume fraction was quantified by the measurement of areal weight density and areal thickness from optical images of tows in a @xmath53 twill carbon - epoxy composite .",
    "then , the pdf of the permeability was determined by a known pdf of @xmath5 and assuming a constant @xmath12 .",
    "to do so , we proposed a method to determine the probability density function of the permeability of porous media .",
    "we employed the kozeny - carmen equation and combined it with the change of variable technique .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath89 the relationship between the local areal weight density and thickness is well approximated by a bivariate normal distribution . @xmath90",
    "the distribution of local fibre volume fraction exhibits a bell - shaped curve and fit well to a normal distribution model . @xmath91 assuming constant @xmath12 , a gamma distribution could more accurately describe the variation in permeability data . + as conclusion , the understanding of the probability distribution of permeability is still taking further clarification but that the hypothesis of normality has been refuted .",

    "<S> permeability of fibrous porous media at the micro / meso scale - level is subject to significant uncertainty due to the heterogeneity of the fibrous media . </S>",
    "<S> the local microscopic heterogeneity and spatial variability porosity , tortuosity and fibre diameter affect the experimental measurements of permeability at macroscopic level . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the selection of an appropriate probability density function ( pdf ) is of crucial importance , in the characterization of both local variations at the microscale and the equivalent permeability at the experimental level ( macroscale ) . </S>",
    "<S> this study addresses the issue of whether or not a normal distribution appropriately represents permeability variations . to do so , ( i ) the distribution of local fibre volume fraction for each tow is experimentaly determined by estimation of each pair of local areal density and thickness , ( ii ) the kozeny - carmen equation together with the change of variable technique are used to compute the pdf of permeability , ( iii ) using the local values of fibre volume fraction , the distribution of local average permeability is computed and subsequently the goodness of fit of the computed pdf is compared with the distribution of the permeability at microscale level </S>",
    "<S> . finally variability of local permeability at the microscale level is determined . </S>",
    "<S> + the first set of results reveals that ( 1 ) the relationship between the local areal density and local thickness in a woven carbon - epoxy composite is modelled by a bivariate normal distribution , ( 2 ) while fibre volume fraction follows a normal distribution , permeability follows a gamma distribution , ( 3 ) this work also shows that there is significant agreement between the analytical approach and the simulation results . </S>",
    "<S> the second set of results shows that the coefficient of variation of permeability is one order of magnitude larger than that of fibre volume fraction . </S>",
    "<S> future work will consider other variables , such as type of fabrics , the degree of fibre preform compaction to determine whether or not the bivariate normal model is applicable for a broad range of fabrics </S>",
