    "transiting extrasolar planets of bright host stars provide a unique opportunity for physical characterization in ways impossible for non - transiting planets that are also too close to their host stars for direct imaging . currently , the transit and radial velocity methods dominate the growth in planet discoveries both overall and for planets suitable for detailed physical characterization .",
    "this paper addresses the question , `` of these two methods , transits or radial velocities , which is more efficient at discovering planets that transit bright stars ? ''",
    "this is a complex question given the astrophysical effects ( e.g.  planet mass - radius relation , stellar mass - radius relation , stellar mass - luminosity relation , radial velocity jitter , stellar activity , etc . ) and technical challenges ( e.g.  instrumentation , telescope aperture , available observing time , costs of operation , available funding opportunities , etc . )",
    "that influence the planet yield of a survey . to compare the performance of a radial velocity survey to that of a transit survey",
    ", we adopt a parametric model for each . with some simplifying assumptions",
    ", we quantify the precision of a radial velocity survey that will achieve the same level of search completeness as a transit survey using the same amount of observing time .",
    "for any transit survey , the vast majority of observations of any particular star can not contribute directly to the detection of a transit , simply because they are made when the planet is not transiting . to be successful ,",
    "a transit survey must make a sufficiently large number of independent observations in order that the probability @xmath3 of witnessing @xmath4 or more transit(s ) matches or exceeds a design requirement .",
    "for example , the four - year kepler mission was designed to witness @xmath5 transits of earth analogs with orbital periods @xmath6 year @xcite . for a specific set of observation times of a transit survey , the _ window function _ ,",
    "@xmath7 , describes the visibility of the repetitive transit signal of any given period , i.e. the planet s orbital period , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "a survey s window function can be computed numerically with high fidelity , either before or after the actual observations , by monte carlo simulations @xcite .    however , analytic approximations to the window function are quicker and more convenient to compute than monte carlo simulations @xcite . in addition , an analytic approximation is readily inverted to predict the minimum observing time necessary to exceed a given probability @xmath7 of witnessing @xmath4 or more transits of a given @xmath8 .",
    "we show in the appendix that the hypergeometric distribution provides a high fidelity statistical approximation to the window function and its derivation gives physical insight into the design of a transit survey or interpretation of results from them .",
    "most importantly we show how the transit survey window function is primarily dependent upon the number of independent observing epochs , which enables us to compare the performance of a transit survey to a radial velocity survey for detecting transiting planets .    for a radial velocity survey ,",
    "the situation is quite different : nearly every measurement may contribute to the planet detection because the star s radial velocity can be measured at any time and is constantly changing in response to the orbiting planet .",
    "( we write `` nearly '' every measurement because multiple observations made at the same epoch could be redundant if one would suffice at that particular orbital phase . ) to estimate the detection sensitivity of a radial velocity survey , we adopt the prescription outlined by @xcite .",
    "our analysis ends at the phase of a survey when the significance of the detection reaches a suitable level such that follow - up observations to refine the ephemeris and confirm the detection are warranted .",
    "thus , we neglect budgeting for the additional observational effort required to follow - up on a significant signal as the effort required depends very strongly on the nature of the signal and remaining ambiguities of the signal that must be ruled out . in the case of a transit survey a detection from a single to few events",
    "leads to ambiguity in the orbital period @xcite that can be difficult to reconcile with low signal to noise detections .",
    "the numerous sources of astrophysical false positives to the transiting planet signal need to be investigated @xcite along with statistical validation @xcite or mass measurement confirmation @xcite . in the case of a radial velocity detection , in addition to the photometric confirmation of a transit signal @xcite ,",
    "typically additional radial velocity observations are required to refine the ephemeris to a suitable level for scheduling the photometric observations @xcite .",
    "also , radial velocity detections must contend with the astrophysical false positives induced by stellar variability @xcite .",
    "we apply our prescription to address two representative case studies .",
    "first , we compare our models of the performance of a particular transiting - planet finder , _ mearth _  and its southern extension , _",
    "mearth_-south @xcite , to that of a particular radial velocity instrument , _ harps _  @xcite and its northern twin , _",
    "@xcite , for detecting a super - earth transiting at the inner edge of the habitable zone ( hz ) as a function of stellar mass . in the second case",
    ", we study the relative performances of these planet finding techniques for finding earth - sized planets transiting at the inner edge of the hz of m dwarf stars . in each case",
    ", we use the inner edge of the hz simply because planets there will have shorter periods than any other planets in their respective hzs and hence will be more easily detected by either method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : transit ] the transit survey window function is introduced , and in the appendix we derive analytic approximations to it .",
    "this leads to simple approximations for the observing time required to reach a specified level of completeness of a transit survey .",
    "the detection sensitivity of a radial velocity survey is inverted in section  [ sec : rv ] in order to determine the observing time required for it to reach an appropriate level of completeness to compete with the transit survey .",
    "the implications of this study as applied to the detection of a transiting super - earth and an earth analog at the inner edge of the hz in section  [ sec : disc ] and its conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we can approach the statistical modeling of a transit survey window function in two ways .",

    "previous work ( e.g. eq . a2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) adopted approach a , where each independent planetary _ orbital period _",
    "interval is a binomial trial with probability of our witnessing it equal to the average fraction of time spent observing @xmath9 . in approach b ( see appendix ) , the appropriate independent time interval is the _ transit duration _ , @xmath10 } , \\label{eq : tdur}\\ ] ] for arbitrary stellar mass , @xmath11 , radius , @xmath12 , and orbital period , @xmath8 .",
    "we have assumed the average relative chord length , @xmath13 and eccentricity @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "effects of non - zero eccentricity on transit survey yield are addressed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "approach b has the advantage of being readily related to individual observations parceled into lengths of the transit duration .",
    "the window function is determined by the number of unique observing epochs , @xmath15 , of duration @xmath16 .",
    "a set of observation exposures at a cadence shorter than the transit duration will improve the signal to noise ratio of the detection , but count as a single parcel increment to @xmath15  for the purposes of the window function .",
    "thus , @xmath15  is not necessarily the number of exposures ( see section  [ sec : hyperg ] ) .",
    "regardless of approach ( a or b ) , the physical situation is the same : in the time span , @xmath17 , between the first and last observations of a particular star with a transiting planet of orbital period , @xmath8 , the expected number of transits is@xmath17/p@xmath18 or @xmath19@xmath17/p@xmath20 transits where @xmath21 is the truncate to nearest integer operation . for uniform and random relative phase of the planetary transits with respect to the set of observation epochs ,",
    "the expectation value of @xmath22@xmath17/@xmath8 ] @xmath24 from the probability , @xmath25 , of witnessing exactly @xmath4 transits ( derived in the appendix ) , the probability , @xmath26 , of witnessing @xmath4 or more transits is given by @xmath27 a transit survey may require detection of @xmath28 transits in order to know the period and hence predict future transits , or it may require @xmath29 transits in order to validate the detection , i.e. confirm that the times separating the transits are all consistent with a particular orbital period .    in the appendix we have isolated the mathematics of approximating the window function analytically .",
    "figure  [ fig : beattycomp ] shows the window function for a hypothetical transit survey that operates in a mode dedicated to a single field for 30 consecutive days with observations for 8 hours each night .",
    "the specifications for the hypothetical transit survey are the same as presented in figure  1 of @xcite to demonstrate their analytical representation of a transit survey and is typical for the first generation of ground - based hot jupiter transit surveys ( _ hat _ ",
    "@xcite ; _ kelt _  @xcite ; _ ogle _  @xcite ; _ qatar _  @xcite ; _ tres _ ",
    "@xcite ; _ wasp _ ",
    "@xcite ; _ xo _  @xcite ; and others ) .",
    "the window function presented in this study and others ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide convenient approximations to the average performance of a transit survey",
    ". these approximations may be useful for design purposes and for real time updates to a transit survey in progress .",
    "also , this study articulates that transit survey completeness , in terms of the window function , derives primarily from the number of distinct observing epochs , @xmath15 , and only secondarily from the time span @xmath17  ( see figure  [ fig : alternatobs ] and discussion in section  [ sec : numericalcomp])@xmath30 the number of exposures ( see section  [ sec : hyperg ] ) ] .",
    "that is , observations can be spread over an observing season or years rather than concentrated in a single observing run .",
    "a consequence is that a longitudinally - distributed network ( e.g. hat - net ) is not necessarily more observationally efficient at finding planets per unit of observing time than a single site ( e.g. wasp ) , all other factors being equal .",
    "however , a longitudinally - distributed network of n telescopes can retire a particular field of view of targets in a smaller number of days than could be accomplished by the same n telescopes located at a single site at the same latitude as the telescopes of the network .",
    "also , continuous observations avoid the ambiguities ( e.g. of orbital period ) inherent in interpreting observations with many gaps where transits can hide .",
    "figure  [ fig : winfunc ] shows the window function for a transit survey that operates in a mode cycling between targets such as employed by the _",
    "mearth _  project @xcite .",
    "_ mearth _  surveys the brightest m  dwarfs by cycling between targets to obtain several observation per target per night .",
    "the observation span is an observing season for each target .",
    "we simulate this mode of operation through specifying a time series with @xmath15@xmath31 observations that is expected for a target from a single observatory over the course of an observing season including losses due to weather . as a proxy for an observing time",
    "series we begin with a continuous pwv time series downloaded from the noaa earth system research laboratory ground - based gps meteorology program @xcite for @xmath329 months starting september , 1 2008 with a 30 minute cadence from flagstaff , az .",
    "we use the celestial coordinates ra 7h dec + 30 , optimized for the middle of the observing season and observatory latitude , to find the airmass for each pwv observations .",
    "only values when the airmass @xmath33 1.8 , pwv @xmath33 10 mm ( to crudely simulate when the weather conditions would be too poor for observations ) , and sun altitude @xmath33 -5 deg are used to simulate times when observations could be made .",
    "the window function assumes stellar parameters appropriate for a mid m  dwarf star ( @xmath34=0.2 @xmath35  @xmath36@xmath34@xmath37 $ ] ; @xmath38=0.26 @xmath36@xmath39@xmath37 $ ] ) .",
    "in addition to the window functions assuming at least @xmath40 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 transit events are observed ( solid lines from top to bottom , respectively ) , figure  [ fig : winfunc ] also shows the window function ( solid orange line ) which corresponds to the triggering mode of operation adopted by the _ mearth _",
    "project @xcite .",
    "real - time analysis of the data identifies a potential flux decrement for a target , and the observing scheduler interrupts cycling through targets and enters a high cadence follow - up and stare mode in order to get a high sensitivity detection of the transit egress .",
    "this has the potential of detecting a planet with a single transit and relaxed photometric precision , which extends the detectability to longer orbital periods and enables sampling more targets .",
    "however , in practice for m  dwarfs , the transit duration @xmath41 hr and the transit must be observed during the first portion of the transit event to allow sufficient time to commence the high cadence staring mode .",
    "thus , @xmath16  must be reduced to account for the triggering mode delay . throughout , we reduce @xmath16  by @xmath42=30 min when simulating the triggering mode . for the mid m  dwarf example shown in figure  [ fig : winfunc ] , the triggering mode window function is superior to the @xmath43 window function for @xmath44 day .",
    "in this section we summarize our metrics for the performance of a radial velocity survey .",

    "we invert equation 24 of @xcite to determine the argument of the error function , @xmath48 the error function argument , @xmath49 , relates the expectation of the periodogram in the presence of a signal , @xmath50 where @xmath51@xmath15@xmath52 is the degrees of freedom , to the detection threshold of the experiment , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of independent frequencies searched and @xmath55 is the false alarm probability of the experiment .",

    "we numerically solve equation  [ eq : rvall ] to derive the limiting @xmath57 that a radial velocity achieves for a given @xmath47 and @xmath15 .",
    "we adopt parameters following @xcite that the radial velocity survey has a @xmath58 and that @xmath59 @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "an additional assumption for the validity of these results is that the baseline of observations is longer than the orbital period of the planet . in this study",
    "we ignore the impact of uncorrected stellar activity for setting a noise floor on radial velocity precision @xcite , and the additional observations necessary to refine the orbital parameters with sufficient precision to make an accurate prediction for the epoch of transit @xcite .",
    "when analyzing the identification of transiting planets from a radial velocity detected sample of planets in this paper , we assume a purely geometric prior transit probability rather than the potentially 10 - 25% higher posterior transit probability for planets first detected with radial velocities @xcite .",
    "with the results from the previous sections , we can evaluate a transit survey designed to detect a transiting planet and quantify the equivalent radial velocity survey that is expected to have the same detection capability for the same total amount of observing time . with the framework described in this paper , we assume both the radial velocity survey and the transit survey achieve @xmath15  observations .",
    "we then determine which method using @xmath15  ( independent of how long it takes to achieve @xmath15  observations ) achieves a higher survey completeness level for the planet of interest .",

    "we first compare the performances of the _ mearth _  transiting survey @xcite and the _ harps _",
    "m dwarf radial velocity survey @xcite for detection of super - earth planets orbiting the brightest m  dwarfs .",
    "then we show general results for the design of future surveys pushing the detection limits down to earth - sized planets .",
    "the steps for the comparison begin with determining the @xmath15  necessary for a transit survey to reach a given percent completeness for an inner hz planet .",
    "we then calculate the radial velocity precision required to detect the same planet with the same amount of observing time .      as an example we calculate the performance for a survey modeled after the _ mearth _",

    "table  [ tab : results ] shows @xmath73 necessary for a transit survey to achieve a completeness probability @xmath74 of witnessing a transit at least once in the triggering mode of operation at @xmath62 .",

    "focusing on the 0.2 @xmath11 star , @xmath76 are required with sufficient precision to detect the corresponding transit depth , @xmath77 ppm .",
    "if every star has a planet orbiting with a period of approximately , @xmath62 , then with @xmath78 , @xmath79 such targets need to be observed .",
    "at least @xmath80 observations are required to expect to find one transiting planet at the inner hz orbiting a 0.2 @xmath11 m  dwarf .",
    "cycling between targets with a cadence of 5 min and 8 hours of observations , reaching 34000 observations requires 355 clear nights .",
    "the above results are first - order guidance assuming unit planet occurrence .",
    "they can be conveniently scaled to the measured occurrence rates of planets orbiting m - dwarfs @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the targets are independent , so this amount of observing time can be achieved with multiple telescopes working in parallel ( _ mearth _  employs eight telescopes and is commissioning eight more in the southern hemisphere ) or observing fainter stars with multiple targets per field .",
    "of course , if the fraction of stars with such a planet is less than unity , the required observing time will be more .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath73 is not monotonically increasing with @xmath11 because the increasing hz period is offset by the increase in @xmath70 with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , the trigger mode delay becomes an appreciable fraction of @xmath70 for the lowest mass stars . for @xmath81 , @xmath82 ,",
    "thus in principle similar number of observations are needed to find a hz planet orbiting a late k as late m star in the triggering mode of operation . however , the minimum number of clear nights necessary to achieve the requisite number of observations @xmath83 , assuming @xmath84  hr observing each night is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , the depth of the transit for fixed planet size is @xmath856 times smaller for late k hosts than late m hosts placing more stringent requirements on the photometric precision for observations of late k hosts .    for an individual target",
    "we determine the radial velocity precision necessary to reach the same level of survey completeness for making a super - earth @xmath86  detection at @xmath62 given the same amount of observing epochs as the transit survey .",
    "in this case the goal of the radial velocity survey is to make a sufficient number of @xmath86  detections in order to identify at least one that also transits .",

    "furthermore , to first order , the resulting window function for a transit survey depends only on the total number of independent observations and secondarily depends upon the distribution of observation times or baseline over which the observations are obtained .",

    ", we predict _ harps _  and the _ mearth _  surveys have approximately the same efficiency for detecting super - earth planets that transit and orbit at the inner hz . however , at the median brightness of the _ mearth",
    "_  sample , @xmath123 , the _ mearth _  survey is predicted to have much higher efficiency at detecting transiting super - earths than _ harps _  due to the degraded radial velocity precision for fainter stars . the higher efficiency is predominately driven by the small geometric transit probability at the inner hz for late m  dwarfs .",

    "specifically , the orbital period time interval represents a binomial trial with probability of our witnessing it equal to the average fraction of time spent observing @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the probability of witnessing exactly @xmath4 transits is @xmath125 recalling that the expectation value for the number of trials @xmath126@xmath17@xmath127 ( eq . [ eq : m ] ) and that the probability of witnessing @xmath4 or more transits @xmath26 is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : probn ] .",
    "approach a also can be addressed , in appropriate limits , specifically large m and small @xmath9 ( e.g. appendix 4 of lyons 1996 ) , using the poisson approximation to the binomial distribution , @xmath128 where @xmath129 . even though the poisson distribution is defined for all @xmath130 ,",
    "the maximum number of transits in time span @xmath17  is m = @xmath21@xmath17/@xmath131 .",
    "the physical interpretation of the poisson process would be that transits are observed at random times at an average rate of @xmath132 transits in @xmath17 , which approaches @xmath133 in the appropriate limit of large @xmath134 .",

    "recommend that the poisson approximation gives good results so long as @xmath135 and @xmath134 is large . while it is the least accurate ,",
    "the poisson approximation is the simplest to compute ; we recommend it for hand calculations ( see section  [ sec : onetransit ] ) and to validate more complicated window function implementations .      in approach b , `` each time we observe , is the planet transiting ? ''",
    ", the statistical model of the window function adopts the transit duration time interval as the relevant independent trial .",
    "we make an analogy between searching for a transiting planet and randomly drawing colored balls from an urn without replacement ( figure  [ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "each ball represents a time interval equal to the transit duration @xmath16  and also a potential observation of a transit .",
    "the parameter @xmath15  in the hypergeometric distribution is the number of unique observation intervals of length @xmath16  that have sufficient sensitivity to detect a transit if it had occurred during the interval . parceling the observing span @xmath17  into intervals of @xmath16  results in a set of @xmath136@xmath17/@xmath16  time intervals , or by analogy @xmath137 balls in the urn . in the illustration ,",
    "the orbital period @xmath8 is six times the transit duration @xmath16 . in general , for circular orbits and central transits , the ratio @xmath8/@xmath16@xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the orbital semimajor axis and the formula neglects the planetary radius .",
    "the illustration shows a contiguous set of @xmath136@xmath17/@xmath16@xmath140 balls , where @xmath141 balls are red ( in transit ) , and the @xmath142 remaining balls are colored white ( out - of - transit ) .",
    "there are @xmath15=5 balls drawn with solid outlines ( observations ) and @xmath143@xmath15@xmath144 balls with dashed outlines ( observation gaps or observation intervals with insufficient sensitivity to detect a transit even if it had occurred in the particular interval ) .",
    "thus the the probability of having @xmath4 observations occur during transit among the @xmath15  observations is given by the hypergeometric distribution , @xmath145 which is appropriate for this case of sampling without replacement .",
    "in the nomenclature of statistics , @xmath146    a limitation common to the binomial and hypergeometric distributions is that their input parameters formally are required to be integers , because of the combinatorics operator `` choose . '' for example , each equation contains @xmath134 choose @xmath4 ; that @xmath4 is an integer is not a problem , but if @xmath134 is forced to also , then the window function can have a stair - step appearance .",
    "this is readily mitigated by using implementations of the operators that can handle real - valued inputs via the gamma function , e.g. @xmath147 one may wish to use stirling s formula or a similar approximation for the factorials , or instead of the gamma function itself , one may wish to use a log(gamma ) function if available , to avoid numerical overflow .",
    "it is possible to show the numerical similarities of the binomial model of @xcite with the hypergeometric model of this study by expressing @xmath148 , then the binomial model can be written as @xmath149 .",
    "the expectation of the binomial model of @xcite , @xmath150=f_{\\rm cov}m = f_{\\rm cov}t_{\\rm obs}/p = n\\tau_{\\rm dur}/p$ ] , is the same as the expectation of the hypergeometric model of this study , @xmath151=nm /",

    "however , since @xmath153 , for parameters generally applicable to a transit survey , the variances are nearly equal .",
    "the probability of witnessing at least one transit ( from equation  [ eq : probn ] ) is @xmath154 associating @xmath155 , equation  [ eq : poione ] is readily inverted : @xmath15@xmath156 .",
    "this provides a convenient benchmark for planning purposes as well checking how probable a potential planetary discovery is in a transit search .        in figure",
