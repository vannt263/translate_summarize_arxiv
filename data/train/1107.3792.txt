    "<S> it has been pointed out that much of the resulting space of parameter values gives rise to chaotic dynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what we now demonstrate is that this observation is largely an artifact of independence , and when truth table entries are not independently distributed , even a slight deviation from balance ( homogeneity ) may push boolean network dynamics to quiescence . </S>",
    "<S> consider networks in which every transfer function is a strong majority ( with @xmath135 being a simple majority ) . </S>",
    "<S> we get a balanced distribution of transfer function by choosing between @xmath91 and @xmath115 with equal probability . </S>",
    "<S> an _ imbalanced distribution _ is obtained by choosing only one of them . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ f : balance ] ( middle ) shows several examples of how the hamming distance evolves for different values of @xmath91 , and contrasts the balanced and unbalanced settings </S>",
    "<S> . the difference could hardly be more dramatic : even a slight deviation from simple majority ( @xmath136 ) is a difference between chaos and quiescence ; indeed , it is instructive to see the initial increase in hamming distance for the imbalanced strong majority with @xmath137 , only to be ultimately suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we can compare the balanced and unbalanced versions of strong majorities with @xmath117 : the balanced version is clearly chaotic , while in the network with the unbalanced analogue , initial perturbation effects erode within two iterations . </S>",
    "<S> a similar picture emerges when we consider nested canalizing functions , previously offered as an explanation of robustness in genetic regulatory networks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> classes of these are generated by a parameter @xmath138 that governs the fraction of 1 s in the transfer function truth table , with larger values of @xmath138 leading to greater imbalance . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ f : balance ] ( right ) compares evolution of networks with nested canalizing functions , as well as with transfer functions following an empirical distribution of transfer functions based on regulatory networks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the main driver of quiescence appears to be the internal inhomogeneity of transfer functions , rather than canalizing properties . </S>",
