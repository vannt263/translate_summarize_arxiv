    "another factor that can affect t@xmath5-based abundance determinations is the temperature fluctuations inside hii regions @xcite .",
    "if they are important , the ( o / h)@xmath41 abundance would be a lower limit . in most cases the effect appears to be small , probably under 0.1 dex @xcite .",
    "fortunately , there is a way to verify the validity of the t@xmath5  method at high metallicities @xcite .",
    "high - resolution observations of the weak interstellar oi@xmath61356 absorption lines towards stars allow one to determine the interstellar oxygen abundance in the solar vicinity with a very high precision .",
    "it should be noted that this method is model - independent .",
    "these observations yield a mean interstellar oxygen abundance of 284  390 o atoms per 10@xmath58 h atoms ( or 12+log(o / h ) = 8.45  8.59 ) @xcite . @xcite",
    "have determined a mean o / h ratio of 345 @xmath5919 o atoms per 10@xmath58 h atoms ( or 12+log(o / h ) = 8.54 ) for the local bubble .",
    "thus , an oxygen abundance 12+log(o / h ) = 8.50 in the interstellar gas at the solar galactocentric distance seems to be a reasonable value .",
    "the value of the oxygen abundance at the solar galactocentric distance traced by ( o / h)@xmath41 abundances in hii regions is then in good agreement with the oxygen abundance derived with high precision from the interstellar absorption lines towards stars ( open square in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : mwg ] ) .",
    "this is strong evidence that the classic t@xmath5  method provides accurate oxygen abundances in high - metallicity hii regions .",
    "the measured oxygen abundance in the solar vicinity provides an indirect way to check our derived central oxygen abundances .",
    "the oxygen abundance in the solar vicinity is 12+log(o / h)=8.50 , and a gas mass fraction @xmath60 @xmath0 0.20 seems appropriate .",
    "the simple model of chemical evolution of galaxies predicts that a decrease of @xmath60 by 0.1 results in a increase of the oxygen abundance by @xmath0 0.12 dex in the range of @xmath60 from @xmath0 0.75 to @xmath0 0.05 .",
    "when all the gas in the solar vicinity will be converted into stars , the oxygen abundance will increase by 0.2  0.25 dex and will reach a value around 12+log(o / h ) = 8.70  8.75 .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with the central oxygen abundances obtained above for the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "there is no room for central oxygen abundances as large as 12+logo / h = 9.00 or greater .",
    "the present study suggests that there is an upper limit to the oxygen abundances in spiral galaxies .",
    "if true , the existing luminosity ",
    "metallicity relation should be revisited .",
    "one can expect the metallicity to increase with luminosity up to 12+(o / h ) @xmath0 8.75 , but to remain approximately constant for higher metallicities , resulting in a flattening of the luminosity ",
    "metallicity relation .",
    "this suggestion will be investigated in a future paper .",
    "the maximum gas - phase oxygen abundance in spiral galaxies is 12+log(o / h ) @xmath0 8.75 .",
    "the central oxygen abundance in the milky way is similar to that in other large spirals .",
    "some fraction of the oxygen is locked into dust grains in hii regions .",
    "@xcite found that the fraction of the dust - phase oxygen abundance in the orion nebula is about 0.08 dex .",
    "then , the true gas+dust maximum value of the oxygen abundance in hii regions of spiral galaxies is 12+log(o / h ) @xmath0 8.85 .",
    "this value can increase up to @xmath0 8.90  8.95 if temperature fluctuations inside hii regions are important .",
