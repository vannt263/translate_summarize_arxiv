    "in the main text , we discussed how the `` parity anomaly '' gives rise to a change in landau level counting in magnetic field and discussed how this fact is related to signatures in the magnetotransport .",

    "breaking of parity symmetry due to the dirac mass term is discussed in appendix b.    let us start from the spin - up block of the bhz hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath143 with @xmath144 , where we have neglected the @xmath145-dependence of the mass term .",
    "this approximation is valid in the low energy limit @xmath146 which means at least up to an energy of @xmath147 .",

    "each block of the bhz hamiltonian @xmath192 ( eq .  ( [ eq : bhzhamiltonian ] ) ) can be interpreted as a massive ( 2 + 1)d dirac equation with a @xmath151-dependent mass term . at first",
    ", we discuss symmetries of a single block and in the second part , we focus on the symmetries of the full bhz hamiltonian .    for a single block ,",
    "invariance under pseudospin trs ( in the band index ) implies that an anti - unitary operator @xmath193 exists such that @xcite @xmath194 with @xmath195 where @xmath196 is a unitary matrix and @xmath197 is the operator of complex conjugation .",
    "parity symmetry in two space dimensions amounts for e.g. @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "invariance under parity symmetry implies then that a unitary operator @xmath199 exists such that @xcite @xmath200 the mass term ( including the newtonian mass ) is odd under both symmetries , e.g. in case of parity symmetry @xmath201 @xmath202 where we have used that @xmath203 .",
    "therefore , pseudospin trs as well as parity symmetry is broken by the mass term giving rise to the `` parity anomaly '' in odd spacetime dimensions .",
    "however , in the full bhz hamiltonian the anomaly cancels since both spin blocks amount for a different sign in the induced current ( compare with eq .",
    "( [ eq : parityanomaly ] ) ) such that the sum must be zero .",
    "the cancellation of the anomalous four - current for the full bhz model can be also understood in the following way : we can define a trs as well as parity operator for the full bhz hamiltonian connecting both spin blocks @xmath204 ( similar to a two flavor ( 2 + 1)d massive dirac equation @xcite ) .",
    "such a trs operator exists and is given by @xmath205 while the parity operator is @xmath206 .",
    "consequently , there is no `` parity anomaly '' for the pure bhz hamiltonian and the total induced current must vanish .",
    "however , in the presence of an exchange or zeeman - like hamiltonian , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeeman ] ) and ( [ eq : exchange ] ) , parity as well as trs are broken , since e.g. @xmath28 is odd under parity symmetry @xmath207 in an external magnetic field ( applying peierls substitution ) , we find additionally to the zeeman and exchange interaction that another parity breaking term arises which is given by @xmath208 all in all , the exchange interaction , the zeeman as well as the particle - hole asymmetry term break parity and renormalize the effective mass gap in magnetic fields as highlighted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : massterm ] ) .",
    "a topological transition is therefore driven by an effective g - factor consisting off all three contributions .    starting from a qsh phase , the total four - current remains zero during an adiabatic increase in the effective g - factor as long as the mass gap of one of the spin - blocks is not closed .",
    "if one of the mass gaps is closed , the system enters a qah ( requires ferromagnetic exchange interaction without an external magnetic field ) or a qahl ( qah state in magnetic fields ) phase and a non - zero anomalous four - current is observed .",
    "finally , one should note that a bia term also violates parity symmetry , where a representation of the bia term given in the dirac basis reads @xcite @xmath209 where @xmath210 is a parameter .",
    "however , rashba spin - orbit interaction in lowest order @xcite @xmath211 where @xmath212 is a parameter , does not violate parity .",
    "both bia and rashba spin - orbit interaction were found to be negligible ( less than @xmath213 mev ) in recent experiments on symmetric hgte qws @xcite .",
    "since the mass gap protects the anomalous four - current and , therefore , the `` parity anomaly '' , such small perturbations can not destroy the `` parity anomaly '' as long as no gap closing occurs ..",
    "this appendix should elucidate how effective bhz - parameters ( see eq .  ( [ eq : bhzhamiltonian ] ) ) for @xmath214 quantum wells have been numerically calculated .",
    "these parameters haven been used in the main text to predict an early topological transition in magnetic fields to a @xmath84 plateau for a @xmath215 thick sample of @xmath108 as depicted in fig .",

    "it is worth noting that mn does not only give rise to an exchange interaction but one must also renormalize kane parameters for a given mn concentration . for small fractions , it is valid to assume that only the band gap parameter @xmath223 is strongly affected @xcite .",
    "this affects the critical thickness above which hgmnte becomes a 2d ti , for instance @xmath224 , while in pure hgte the transition should have already emerged at @xmath225 @xcite .    the full hamiltonian is then mapped onto a cubic lattice and we assume periodic boundary conditions in x- and y - direction , while in z - direction the interface between hgmnte and cdte is taken into account by having @xmath226-dependent kane parameters @xcite .",

    "the eigenvalue problem of the schrdinger equation can then be solved numerically .",

    "<S> the solution comes from the fact that qah and qahl phases break parity symmetry due to the topological mass , @xmath58 ( see appendix b ) , which enforces adding a topological chern - simons term in the gauge field lagrangian , @xmath97 where @xmath98 /h$ ] is the chern - simons coupling constant , which modifies the maxwell equation , @xmath99 the term originating from the chern - simons action generates a flux @xmath100 which compensates charge such that the full effective charge @xmath34 remains zero ( @xmath37 ) . when the chemical potential is located within the mass gap at @xmath101 with @xmath102 </S>",

    "<S> we believe that indeed these stable plateaus are direct signatures of the `` parity anomaly '' in these systems and the sign of g - factors determines if the stable plateau occurs for @xmath123 or @xmath124 . furthermore , after crossing of the two @xmath62 lls at @xmath125 @xcite , the adiabatic condition is possibly not anymore valid . </S>",

    "<S> values of the critical field @xmath133 must be therefore found numerically . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we omit exchange coupling ( @xmath136 ) , one obtains an analytical expression for a transition from the qsh phase to qahl phase . </S>",
    "<S> closing of the gap for a spin - up block corresponds to @xmath113 with @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the effective g - factor without exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly this transition can occur without any magnetization or magnetic impurities but purely from the particle - hole asymmetry and effective g - factors terms which act in magnetic field as the mass connected with the `` parity anomaly '' . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that in the qahl phase , the hall conductance of the edge states should be more precisely quantized in comparison to the qshl phase and survive even in large magnetic fields ( due to lack of backscattering ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we predict a transition from qshl phase , characterized by a local two - terminal conductance of @xmath139 , to a qahl phase at @xmath140 , characterized by @xmath141 , and finally to the trivial phase at @xmath125 ( see green dashed line in fig .  </S>",
