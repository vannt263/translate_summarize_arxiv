    "expectation values take a form reminiscent of classical statistical mechanics : they are averages with respect to a distribution @xmath7 , where @xmath12 takes values in some ( as yet unspecified ) space @xmath13 : @xmath14 here @xmath11 is a function that depends only on the operator @xmath15 of interest , and @xmath16 is a normalized distribution that depends only on the density matrix @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "although _ quasiprobability _ distributions @xmath7 satisfying indeed exist @xcite , it is often the case that no _ positive - definite _ @xmath7 exists for a given @xmath17 .",
    "the distribution that is the principal subject of this paper is the wigner function , best known as a joint distribution of position and momentum @xcite .",
    "another example is the distribution of local hidden variables that predetermine the outcome of measurements on components of an entangled state . here",
    "the assumption @xmath18 implies certain inequalities between correlations that are violated by the quantum mechanical result , demonstrating the nonexistence of a positive distribution @xcite",
    ".    also represents path integral methods , where @xmath12 is a path in a coherent - state manifold or a time - dependent auxiliary field .",
    "there is no difficulty in principle in working with non - positive distributions , provided one is sufficiently wary when applying the axioms of probability theory . in practice , however , non - positivity can be a serious hindrance to numerical computation of the integrals .",
    "monte carlo techniques typically evaluate integrals of the form by sampling @xmath19 from a distribution @xmath16 .",
    "if the average sign @xmath20 is small , convergence with sample size becomes intolerably slow .",
    "this notorious _ sign problem _ , a frequent hindrance to quantum monte carlo calculations , was first noted in the context of fermion simulations @xcite but appears in other contexts @xcite .",
    "the coherent - state path integral presents the system perhaps least amenable to monte carlo simulation : the weight is complex and contains a rapidly varying berry phase .",
    "for this reason , such integrals have rarely @xcite been tackled by monte carlo techniques .",
    "a more widely used approach for monte carlo simulation of many - body systems replaces the interaction by a gaussian average over an auxiliary field .",
    "the auxiliary field transports the system around a path in state space , with the state relaxing towards the instantaneous ground state in the field @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the auxiliary field is a thermally broadened distribution of the operators to which it is coupled @xcite .",
    "thus the results presented here for coherent states can cast light on the sign problem in the auxiliary - field monte carlo method .",
    "an alternative to direct evaluation of the path integral is to integrate all non - zero frequency modes out of the path integral , thereby mapping the system to an effective _ classical _ system , usually determined variationally @xcite .",

    "the function @xmath27 , regarded as a boltzmann distribution of the variables @xmath26 , forms the basis of a classical statistical mechanics in phase space @xcite .",
    "this distribution is an intuitive interpretation of the path centroid distribution _ if the observables represented by @xmath28 are compatible_. however , this is not always the case : the distribution resulting from a phase - space path integral over canonical coordinates @xmath29 would be a wigner function .",
    "it is such distributions that form the subject of this paper .",
    "the present author has previously shown a formal correspondence between the path - centroid spin distribution in the coherent - state path integral and the spin wigner function @xcite .",
    "this work made the assumption of continuous paths , implicit in field - theoretical treatments @xcite , leading to representation of the spin by its matrix element @xmath30 .",
    "( here the coherent - state label @xmath31 is a unit vector in @xmath32 . ) however , because of the conditionally convergent nature of the path integral , the correspondence between the spin representation in the path integral and the wigner function depends on the class of paths appearing in the path integral . while some forms of the measure require use of the matrix element @xcite , brownian paths in the limit of divergent diffusion coefficient are non - differentiable , and require the diagonal representative @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the apparent ambiguity of the functional integral representations of the hubbard model has similarly been ascribed to questions of continuity of paths @xcite .",
    "subsequent work reported briefly @xcite demonstrated that , if the path integral for spin is defined on a sequence of spherical polygons , the distribution of the path centroid of the diagonal representative of the spin converges onto the spin wigner function .",

    "the next section defines the wigner function and coherent state formalism used here .",
    "derives the main result of this work , that the wigner function of a set of operators can be computed as a histogram of their time - averaged diagonal representatives : @xmath34 here @xmath9 are operators commuting with the hamiltonian , @xmath12 are @xmath24-number variables and @xmath35 are the diagonal representatives of the operators @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is the path centroid , the time average of the diagonal representative .",
    "the first set of angle brackets represents a thermal expectation value , and the second an average over @xmath4-vertex polygonal paths in the coherent - state path integral ; @xmath38 is the delta function in @xmath39 . for finite @xmath4",
    "the distribution is broadened , typically by a gaussian of variance inversely proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "an application to a spin @xmath40 particle is presented in .",
    "finally , discusses the interpretation and wider applicability of these results .",
    "non - positive regions of the wigner function tend to emerge if the dominant path for a given value of the path centroid has a berry phase that is an odd multiple of @xmath10 .",
    "the state of a system is specified by its density matrix @xmath41 , a positive hermitian operator with trace @xmath42 .",
    "this is written in the form of a canonical density matrix of a system in thermal equilibrium at an inverse temperature @xmath43 ; the foregoing equation can be taken as defining a hamiltonian ( up to an additive constant ) for any non - singular @xmath17 .",

    "this is @xcite @xmath59 ( here @xmath60 is the magnitude of the classical spin vector , and @xmath40 is the spin quantum number . )    the representation of the spin distribution as a function of a vector @xmath61 demands comment .",
    "this is appropriate in the context of the statistical mechanics of composite spins , where the state is not restricted to a single spin-@xmath40 representation .",
    "the total spin has a distribution in the same space , which allows for dispersion in the magnitude , and the formalism is explicitly isotropic .",
    "a more natural choice for a fixed spin @xmath40 is the distribution of directions of a vector of magnitude @xmath62 ; the space is a sphere @xmath63 , and a family of distributions on the sphere can be derived from the coherent - state representation of the spin @xcite .",
    "we shall relate the distributions by embedding the sphere in @xmath32 : the correspondence is between sets of points on @xmath63 and their vector average .      before relating these wigner functions to coherent - state path integrals",
    ", we review the properties of generalized coherent states relevant to the present work @xcite .    coherent states @xmath64 , labelled by a variable taking values in some manifold , @xmath65 , provide a continuous , overcomplete and non - orthogonal basis for a finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath66 .",

    "there is substantial cancellation of the real part of the weights ( the sign problem ) , which hinders convergence .",
    "since the pcd is spherically symmetric , we only require the radial distribution @xmath140 because the coordinate transformation is nonlinear , this distribution is not the wigner function of the operator @xmath141 ; in particular , it is not a positive distribution .",
    "shows the numerically accumulated histograms for the radial distribution and their convergence with @xmath4 to the wigner function .",
    "the plots are shown for a relatively small number @xmath142 of monte carlo steps to highlight the influence of the sign problem on convergence .",
    "knowledge of the phase distribution , and of the correlation between phase and path centroid , is of importance both to determine the feasibility of convergence and to develop methods of accelerating convergence @xcite .",
    "the paths contributing to @xmath143 enclose a small area , so that the phase distribution is peaked near zero and the spin distribution is positive .",
    "the action is real for @xmath144 ( the static approximation to the path integral ) , and for @xmath145 , where the path encloses no area .",
    "non - zero phases appear from @xmath146 , where the spherical polygons enclose non - zero area .",
    "this is the smallest value that retains information about spin quantization , and distinguishes the spectra of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin systems @xcite . in this case",
    "the weights are complex , but there is still correlation between the time - averaged spin and the phase , as shows . for @xmath147 the berry phases ( modulo @xmath148 )",
    "are nearly uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath148 @xcite , and weakly correlated with the path centroid , so that convergence is poor .",
    "statistics are poor for the wigner function for large path averages @xmath149 due to uniform sampling , and for small path averages @xmath150 due to destructive interference between paths of positive and negative weights .",
    "these ranges overlap for large @xmath40 and @xmath4 , giving poor statistics for the full interval",
    ". the histograms would converge to the wigner function if the limit of infinitely many monte carlo steps were taken _ before _",

    "quantization is apparent when @xmath153 and becomes exact as @xmath152 .",
    "the distribution corresponding to commuting operators , measured at a single time , is a non - negative effective boltzmann distribution in configuration space @xcite .",
    "interference between paths occurs as the result of superposition of amplitudes , but the probabilities are positive .",
    "if the operators do not commute , the resulting distribution need not be positive . should one interpret the exponentiated action of a path not just as the weight by which functionals of the path are to be averaged , but as a ( complex ) quasiprobability that a spin take a particular closed path , one can see the quasiprobabilities themselves interfering destructively .",
    "the question of whether incompatible observables each take given values is impermissible in quantum mechanics ; we should not expect the answer to be drawn from a positive distribution . however , the question of whether the point @xmath28 lies in a subset @xmath154 is well defined , provided that @xmath155 is sufficiently large that the coarse - grained wigner function @xmath156 is positive .",
    "thus the sum of the weights of all paths with centroid in @xmath155 will be positive .",
    "a heuristic argument helps one to understand the oscillations in sign of the wigner function in terms of the berry phases of paths . because long paths are suppressed by an overlap factor , the dominant paths @xmath157 contributing to the path centroid @xmath158 are the shortest ones exploring a region of low energy",
    ". the wigner function will be negative where these paths have a berry phase near an odd multiple of @xmath10 .",
    "of course the entropy gain in extending the paths leads to a broad distribution of paths @xcite , but the minimum may still be visible as a caustic .",
    "there are two ways this may arise .",
    "firstly , if the coherent state manifold is curved the path centroid does not in general lie in the manifold ; this implies a lower bound on the length of the path . such is the case for su(2 ) coherent states discussed in .",
    "the shortest paths on the unit sphere with centroid @xmath159 are small circles enclosing solid angle @xmath160 ; a spin @xmath40 performing such a conical path will acquire a berry phase @xmath161",
    ". the pcd should therefore be positive for @xmath162 and cross zero whenever the phase is an odd multiple of @xmath163 .",
    "such an argument predicts zeros with positive gradient at @xmath164 ,      \\label{eq : heuristiczeros}\\ ] ] to be compared with the exact result @xmath165 ,      \\label{eq : exactzeros}\\ ] ] for integer [ half - integer ] spins respectively .",
    "this ( admittedly crude ) argument gives the correct spacing of the zeros to @xmath166 .",
    "it is also possible for the dominant paths to have non - zero phase in a flat coherent state manifold if hamiltonian has a local maximum near the position of the path centroid .",
    "this is left for a further investigation .",
    "these results provide insight into the origin of the monte carlo sign problem .",
    "if the variables sampled in a quantum monte carlo simulation correspond to non - commuting operators , the joint distribution of their time average will be a wigner function , indicating the presence of a non - positive integrand .",
    "such an example might be the total spin of an interacting system or , more generally , a vector order parameter generating a non - abelian symmetry group . much more frequently , the hubbard - stratonovich transformation replaces the interaction by an auxiliary field , with monte carlo integration over time - dependent configurations of this field .",
    "the distribution of the time - averaged auxiliary field is a gaussian convolution of the distribution of the operators to which it is coupled , with variance proportional to temperature @xcite .",
    "thus the same considerations apply to the auxiliary - field monte carlo method at low temperatures ; however , as the path space differs from the geodesic polygons discussed here , the results will be quantitatively different .",
