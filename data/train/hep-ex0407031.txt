    "the still not well established production mechanism of the @xmath0 meson as well as its interaction with protons can be investigated via measurements of the following observables available in proton - proton scattering :      measurements of the total cross section for the @xmath1 reaction have been performed at various excess energies in many laboratories worldwide  @xcite .",
    "the existing data , gathered utilizing different experimental techniques are in excellent agreement with each other   reaction . for an overview picture",
    "see for instance fig .",
    "8a in  @xcite ] .",
    "theoretical considerations of the excitation function led in most cases to the conclusion that close - to - threshold production of the @xmath0 mesons in proton - proton collisions proceeds predominantly via the excitation and deexcitation of the negative parity s@xmath2(1535 ) resonance  . despite the very good agreement between different theoretical models as far as the leading @xmath0 creation mechanism is concerned , there are a lot of discrepancies when trying to explain which out of the considered exchanged mesons plays the dominant role in the excitation of the s@xmath2 . as it was shown by nakayama et al .",
    "@xcite , both pseudoscalar and vector meson exchanges result in equally well descriptions of the excitation function for the @xmath1 reaction close to threshold .",
    "measurements of the close - to - threshold angular distributions of the @xmath0 meson emission in the centre - of - mass system at excess energies of q=15  @xcite , 15.5  @xcite , 37  @xcite , and 41  mev  @xcite showed rather flat distributions .",
    "it is concluded from these data that in the lower excess energy range the @xmath0 meson is mainly produced in the @xmath3-wave , while at higher excess energies the influence of the @xmath4-wave starts to play an important role  @xcite .",
    "the contribution from the @xmath5-wave seems to be negligible .",
    "also the proton s angular distributions of the centre - of - mass emission angle  @xcite show an isotropic behaviour . at q=15  mev the data indicate dominance of the @xmath6 transition distorted slightly by the contribution from the @xmath7 . at q=40  mev",
    "there is visible an additional presence of the @xmath8 transition  @xcite .",
    "contributions from the other partial waves were found to be of minor importance . in contradiction to these results , the emission plane of the @xmath1 reaction was found to be anisotropic  @xcite  . this effect has not been explained theoretically yet .      the high statistics production of @xmath0 mesons in proton - proton collisions at @xmath9  mev allowed to perform a dalitz plot analysis of the 3-body final state  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , beside the clear enhancement seen in the lower range of the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath10 subsystem , originating in the strong proton - proton final state interaction , the presence of a wide bump in the upper range of this plot has been observed .",
    "different approaches have been applied in order to explain the origin of this wide bump .",
    "nakayama et .",
    "@xcite described the distribution by introducing @xmath11-waves in the @xmath10 subsystem .",
    "this approach , although in agreement with the shapes of both @xmath10 and @xmath12 invariant masses , fails when explaining the shape of the excitation function for the @xmath1 reaction in the range below q=40  mev .",
    "it is also worth to mention that an indication of such a bump was also seen in the @xmath10 invariant mass distribution at q=4.5  mev  @xcite , where one expects the presence of @xmath13-waves only . a three - body calculation performed by fix and arenhvel  @xcite",
    "could also describe the bump in the @xmath10 invariant mass at q=15.5  mev well , however it fails in explaning the origin of the peak in the low range of @xmath10 invariant mass .",
    "it also does nt reproduce the shape of the @xmath10 invariant mass at q=41  mev .",
    "the @xmath12 invariant mass distributions were not described in this approach .",
    "solution based on the parametrization of the reaction amplitude proposed by deloff  @xcite resulted in a good description of the @xmath10 and @xmath12 invariant masses at q=15.5  mev .",
    "however , it fails at q=40  mev .",
    "another model proposed by the same author , based on a three - particle pair - wise approach via the hyperspherical harmonics  @xcite , led to a good description of @xmath10 and @xmath12 invariant mass distributions at q=15.5  mev .",
    "solutions at q=40  mev as well as the excitation function were not discussed in frame of this model .",
    "polarisation observables should provide a more detailed information on the dynamics of the @xmath0 meson creation in hadronic collisions , due to their sensitivity to the interference terms between @xmath14 and @xmath15 waves . the first attempt to measure the proton analysing power for the @xmath16 has been undertaken by the cosy-11 group , with a set of data at q=40  mev  @xcite .",
    "the data , within their rather large error bars , are consistent with zero , which indicates the absence of higher - than-@xmath3 partial waves in @xmath0 production at q=40  mev .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath15 interference term as well as the sum of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 interference terms were extracted in the analysis and are equal to @xmath19b and @xmath20b , respectively .",
    "in particular , this may indicate that there is no interference between the @xmath14 and @xmath15 waves .",
    "recently , the disto collaboration has obtained the set of a@xmath21 data at excess energies far from threshold , which surprisingly also turned out to be consistent with zero within the error bars  @xcite .",
    "beside the upcoming data from the cosy-11 collaboration for the proton analysing power in the @xmath16 reaction at q=10 and 37 mev   it was proposed to measure the spin correlation function   values are given for instance in  @xcite .",
    "] for the @xmath22 reaction at cosy  @xcite .",
    "the latter would be possible at an external target station at cosy with a frozen spin target .",
    "for a high efficiencies in the @xmath23 event separation the wasa detector  @xcite , which will be moved to cosy in the near future , would be at best suited .",
    "the spin correlation function is an model - independent direct measure of the contribution of the @xmath6 transition in the creation of the @xmath0 meson  @xcite . performing this experiment in the range of the excess energies , where the only contributions to the production amplitude are those from the @xmath6 and @xmath7 transitions , one will be able to exctract contributions from the both transitions in this excess energy range .",
