    "there exist a large consensus in the heavy - ion physics community that a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons is formed during the first instant of the collision of heavy nuclei for sufficiently high incoming energies @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the properties of the highly excited nuclear matter produced requires the use of physical quantities sensitive to the initial partonic state of the system which survive hadronization and the subsequent hadronic evolution .",
    "numerous probes based on the eventwise fluctuations of physical quantities have been proposed to investigate the state and the properties of the fireball @xcite . among them , charged particle ratio fluctuations , charge transfer fluctuations , baryon number - strangeness correlations and charge - strangeness correlations were prominently proposed to pin down the formation of the deconfined phase at rhic @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that these quantities should reflect the properties of the system in the first instants of the reaction and survive the whole evolution : with a strong longitudinal flow , any conserved charge is frozen in a given rapidity window because the expansion is too fast for the initial partonic fluctuations to relax through the transport of charges in and out of a given rapidity slice .",
    "thus , qgp fluctuations should not have the possibility to relax to their hadronic expectation values .",
    "it is clear that the size of the rapidity window for fluctuation studies must not be too wide in order to avoid global charge conservation which would lead to a vanishing signal , but also neither too small to avoid purely statistical fluctuations and the transport of charges in and out of the slice under consideration by hadronic rescattering .",
    "the generally accepted rapidity width is of the order of @xmath2 units in rapidity .",
    "however , hadronization itself might bring the initial qgp correlations and fluctuations to values compatible with the hadronic expectations . how to calculate or describe the non - perturbative domain of qcd where the physics of hadronization sits remains today an open question .",
    "a possible mechanism consists of the recombination of quarks into hadrons @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "the most striking evidences for recombination are the number - of - constituent - quarks scaling of the elliptic flow @xmath3 @xcite and the large number of baryons over number of mesons ratio in the intermediate @xmath4 range measured in central au+au collisions at rhic energies @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the quark molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model @xcite where quarks coalesce locally in coordinate and momentum space due to a confining inter - quark potential .    in previous studies",
    "@xcite performed with qmd and in an earlier exploratory work @xcite , it was argued that recombination leads to a complete vanishing of various initial state qgp fluctuation and correlation signals .",
    "we extend this idea further and show that dynamical recombination generally blurs qgp signals constructed from the correlations and fluctuations of conserved charges .",
    "besides the predicted impossibility to experimentally establish the existence of qgp fluctuations , our results are important for the fluctuation investigations planned for the search of the critical endpoint of the qcd phase diagram at the forthcoming fair facility at gsi .",
    "the article is organized as follow : we first introduce the quark molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model and address the problem of entropy conservation at the partonic / hadronic transition which might occur in some recombination approaches .",
    "we detail the situation for our dynamical recombination procedure and argue that we respect the necessary increase of entropy with time . within our sample of events generated with the qmd model , we then investigate the charged particle ratio fluctuations , the charge transfer fluctuations , the baryon number - strangeness correlation coefficient , the charge - strangeness correlation coefficient and discuss the influence of recombination - hadronization for all these observables .",
    "we also compare the result of the qmd with lattice data @xcite on various ratios of susceptibilities and to directly investigate the susceptibilities by performing event - by - event analyses .",
    "finally , we discuss the reasons for the transition from the initial qgp fluctuations and correlations to their hadronic value .",
    "the qmd model @xcite employed here is a semi - classical molecular dynamics approach where quarks are treated as point - like particles carrying color charges and interact via a linear heavy quark potential .",
    "initial conditions for the qmd are taken from the hadron - string transport model urqmd @xcite : after the two incoming nuclei have passed through each other , ( pre- ) hadrons from the strings and fully formed hadrons from the urqmd model are decomposed into quarks with current masses @xmath6  mev and @xmath7  mev . at the highest rhic energy , this happens at a center of mass time of @xmath8  fm / c .",
    "it should be noted that the qualitative results of the present study are not restricted to any specific initial state .",
    "the urqmd model is solely used to provide an exemplary initial state after the initial @xmath9 production has taken place .",
    "the quarks are then let to evolve and interact within the qmd via a linear potential @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the string tension and @xmath12 is the position of particle @xmath13 .",
    "therefore the full hamiltonian of the model reads : @xmath14 where @xmath15 counts the number of particles in the system and the term @xmath16 takes into account the color dependence of the interaction .",
    "the quark(anti-)quark interaction within this potential naturally leads to confinement through the binding of ( anti-)quarks into color neutral clusters .",
    "new hadrons are formed from quarks whose momentum and positions are close to each others .",
    "typical values for the relative momenta of the quarks in the two - particle rest frame at hadronization are @xmath17  mev , the typical distance is below 1  fm , i.e. hadronization occurs locally into hadronic clusters of mesonic and baryonic type that resemble the yo - yo states of the lund model .",
    "most of the mass of the newly formed hadrons come from the potential energy between the quarks forming the considered cluster .",
    "we generally obtain clusters with large masses mapped to hadronic resonances and thus describe the transition from current quark masses to constituent quark masses of the order of 300  mev after hadronization has occured .",
    "these clusters are then mapped to hadron states that are later allowed to decay in the further evolution of the system .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a detailed discussion of the qmd model .",
    "the question of entropy at the parton / hadron transition needs to be examined when quark recombination is used to describe hadronization .",
    "entropy is proportional to the number of particles in a gas of massless partons / hadrons .",
    "thus , when partons recombine to form new hadrons , the total number of particles decreases and with it entropy .",
    "this situation is not acceptable as it violates the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "contrary to many other recombination models , one can argue that qmd does not violate the entropy condition .",
    "in fact , entropy does not only depend on the number of particles but also on their masses as examined in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath18 , entropy can be simply approximated for a gas of massive particles through : @xmath19 where @xmath20 stands for entropy , @xmath15 for the number of particles in the system , @xmath21 for their average mass and @xmath22 for the temperature at the transition .",

    "the mean rapidity shift is @xmath152.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    figs  [ fig : xoy ] shows the time evolution of @xmath153 ( top left ) , @xmath154 ( top right ) and @xmath155 ( bottom ) from qmd calculations where the quark system is let to evolve according to eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] ( full circles ) , when the quark cluster are mapped to hadronic states but resonances not allowed to decay ( open squares ) and finally for full qmd calculations with mapping and resonance decay included ( open circles ) .",
    "the effect of the rapidity shift depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rapidityshift ] is the difference between the calculations without mapping ( full circles ) and without resonance decay ( open circles ) .",
    "@xmath153 without mapping stays flat around @xmath156 whereas @xmath153 increases with time from @xmath156 up to @xmath157 .",
    "the further increase to @xmath158 in full qmd calculations is related to the decay of resonances .",
    "@xmath154 increases smoothly from @xmath159 up to @xmath160 without mapping and from @xmath159 up to @xmath161 with mapping .",
    "the further increase to @xmath162 is due to the continuing decay of resonances .",
    "the situation is markedly different for @xmath155 which decreases with time from @xmath163 down to @xmath164 with no visible difference between all sets of events . in this last case ,",
    "the decrease of @xmath155 with time is related to the potential - driven gathering of the quarks into color neutral clusters .",
    "we thus conclude that the ratios of susceptibilities is influenced by these three different effects with varying importance .",
    "the correlation due to the inter - quark potential used , the rapidity shift of the quarks to the rapidity of the hadronic cluster at hadronization , and the decay of resonances .",
    "we have investigated various quantities constructed from the fluctuations and correlations of the conserved charges within the dynamical recombination model quark molecular dynamics ( qmd ) which includes an explicit microscopic transition from partonic to hadronic matter . the sample of events used consists of central au+au / pb+pb reactions simulated with the qmd model from low ags energies on ( @xmath0  agev ) up to the highest rhic energy available ( @xmath1  gev ) .",
    "we first discussed our approach and addressed the problem of entropy conservation at the partonic / hadronic transition with quark recombination .",
    "we find that the hadronization procedure implemented in the qmd model is compatible with the necessary increase of entropy with time .",
    "the charged particle ratio fluctuations @xmath37 , the charge transfer fluctuations @xmath79 , the baryon number - strangeness correlation coefficient @xmath84 , the charge - strangeness correlation coefficient @xmath85 were then computed and found to be compatible with their hadronic expectation values in the qmd final state , even though in line with the expected qgp results in the early stage .",
    "the vanishing of the initial qgp correlations and fluctuations occurs at the partonic / hadronic transition and was traced back to the recombination - hadronization process .",
    "our results are supported by the agreement of our model with various ratios of susceptibilities calculated in lattice qcd .",
    "the investigation of the variances and covariances divided by the number of charged particles @xmath165 permits to directly access information on diagonal and off - diagonal susceptibilities .",
    "we show that these quantities exhibit a sharp increase from their qgp to their hadronic value at the transition .",
    "all the susceptibilities present a maximum in the vicinity of the hadronization time with the notable exception of the electric charge susceptibility @xmath166 .",
    "we stress that the study of these quantities , only taking into account the electric charge @xmath43 , baryon number @xmath88 and strangeness @xmath20 ( or another equivalent set of conserved charges ) , allows to treat completely the problem of initial qgp correlations and fluctuations for a system of light quark flavours @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "this work can be extended to heavy quark flavours .",
    "the transition from the initial qgp to the expected hadronic correlation and fluctuation values results from various effects .",
    "the vanishing qgp signal for charged particle ratio fluctuations , charge transfer fluctuations as well as for the @xmath116 coefficients are driven by the decrease of the number of charged particles @xmath65 at hadronization .",
    "for the ratios of susceptibilities , independent of @xmath65 , the vanishing signal is related to the gathering of quarks into color neutral clusters due to the interaction potential used , the rapidity shift of the quark to the hadronic cluster rapidity at hadronization , and the decay of resonances .",
    "the relative importance of these effects differs for different ratios .",
    "the fact that no similar fluctuation signals was ever observed in the experimental data until now can thus be understood as the result of ( recombination-)hadronization . it would be interesting to see the experimental result of the fluctuation and correlation quantities investigated here as they are complementary to the charged particle ratio fluctuations , already extensively measured .",
