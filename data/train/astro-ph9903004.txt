    "the idea that our present universe could be populated by a sea of stochastically distributed gravitational waves ( gw ) is both _ experimentally appealing _ and _ theoretically plausible_. it is _ appealing _ since it would offer a natural cosmological source for the gw detectors which will come in operation during the next decade , like ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , lisa @xcite and geo-600 @xcite .",

    "the causality principle applied to the cosmic microwave ( cmb ) phtons seems to demand a moment where different patches of the universe emitting a highly isotropic cmb were brought in causal contact .",
    "this is one of the original motivations of the inflationary paradigm @xcite .",
    "it is not unreasonable to think that in its early stages the universe passed through different rates of expansion deviating ( more or less dramatically ) from the radiation dominated evolution .",
    "it has been correctly pointed out through the years and in different frameworks @xcite that every change in the early history of the hubble parameter leads , inevitably , to the formation of a stochastic gravitational wave spectrum whose frequency behavior can be used in order to reconstruct the thermodinamical history of the early universe . the question which naturally arises concerns the strength of the produced gravitational wave background .    if an inflationary phase is suddenly followed by a radiation dominated phase preceding the matter dominated epoch , the amplitude of the produced gravitons background can be computed and the result is illustrated in fig .",

    "the soft branch of the spectrum is then constrained and the bound reads @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",

    "in general the slope of the logarithmic energy spectrum is typically `` blue '' since it mildly increases with the frequency .",
    "more specifically the slope depends upon the stiff model and it can be shown @xcite that the maximal slope ( corresponding to a linear increase in @xmath32 ) can be achieved in the case where the sound velocity of the effective matter sources exactly equals the speed of light @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] we illustrate the case of maximal slope in the hard branch corresponding to @xmath33 .",

    "[ f1 ] ) the most constraining bound comes from large scale observations . in our case",
    "the most constraining bounds for the height of the spike and for the whole spectrum come from short distance physics and , in particular , from eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) . in order to visually motivate the need for an accurate computation of the graviton spectra in the case where an inflationary phase is followed by a stiff phase , let us focus our attention on the frequency range where the gravitational wave detectors are ( or will be ) operating .",

    "notice finally that the cross - correlation of two resonant spherical detectors @xcite might be able to achieve sensitivities as low as @xmath37 always in the khz range .",
    "spikes in the stochastic graviton background are not forbidden by observations and are also theoretically plausible whenever a stiff phase follows a radiation dominated phase . in this paper , by complementing and extending the analysis of @xcite and of @xcite , we want to study more accurately the spectral properties of the relic gravitons with special attention to the structure of the hard peak",
    ". we will also be interested in comparing the predictions of the models with the foreseen capabilities of the interferometric and resonant detectors .",
    "the plan of our paper is the following .",
    "in section ii we will introduce the basic aspects of the quintessential inflationary models . in section iii",
    "we will compute the relic graviton energy spectra . in section iv we will discuss the power spectra and the associated spectral densities . in section v we will compare the obtained spectra with the sensitivities of the planned interferometric and non - interferometric detectors . in section vi we will analyze the impact of the slow - rolling corrections on the structure of the hard peak .",
    "section vii contains our concluding remarks . for sake of completeness",
    "we made the choice of reporting in the appendix some relevant derivations of the formulas used in obtaining our results .",
    "recently j. peebles and a. vilenkin @xcite presented a model where the idea of a post - inflationary phase stiffer than radiation is dynamically realized .",
    "one of the motivations of the scenario is related to a recent set of observations which seem to suggest that @xmath38 ( the present density parameter in baryonic plus dark matter ) should be significantly smaller than one and probably of the order of @xmath39 .",
    "if the universe is flat , the relation between luminosity and red - shift observed for type ia supernovae @xcite seem to suggest that the missing energy should be stored in a fluid with negative pressure .",
    "the missing energy stored in this fluid should be of the order of @xmath40 gev@xmath41 , too small if compared with the cosmological constant arising from electroweak spontaneous symmetry bereaking ( which would contribute with @xmath42 ) .",
    "the idea is that this effective cosmological constant could come from a scalar field @xmath43 ( the quintessence @xcite field ) whose potential is unbounded from below @xcite .",
    "according to peebles and vilenkin , @xmath43 could be identified with the inflaton and , as a result of this identification , the effective potential of @xmath43 will inflate for @xmath44 and it will be unbounded from below for @xmath45 acting , today , as an effective ( time dependent ) comological term . a possible potential leading to the mentionad dynamics could be @xmath46 where , if we want the present energy density in @xmath43 to be comparable with ( but less then ) the total ( present ) energy density , we have to require @xmath47 gev .",
    "the scenario we are describing can be implemented with any other inflationary potential ( for @xmath48 ) and the example of a chaotic potential is only illustrative .",
    "our considerations will be largely independent on the specific potential used and we will comment , when needed , aboout possible differences induced by the specific type of potential .",
    "let us consider the evolution equations of an inflationary universe driven by a single field @xmath43 in a conformally flat metric @xmath49 using the conformal time @xmath50 the coupled system describing the evolution of the scale factor and of @xmath43 is @xmath51 where @xmath52 . since the scalar field potential is unbounded from below , after a phase of slow - rolling the inflaton evolves towards a phase where the kinetic energy of the inflaton dominates .",
    "for instance one can bear in mind the form of @xmath53 reported in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) .",
    "the background enters then a stiff phase where the energy density of the inflaton @xmath54 and the scale factor evolve as @xmath55 when an inflationary phase is followed by a stiff phase a lot of hard gravitons will be generated . at the same time the energy density of the background sources will decay as @xmath56 whereas the energy density of the short wave - lengths gravitons will decay as @xmath57 .",
    "te universe will soon be dominated by hard gravitons whose non - thermal spectrum @xcite would be unacceptable since gravitons can not thermalize below the planck scale .",
    "a solution to this potential difficulty came from l. ford @xcite who noted that in the limit of nearly conformal coupling also scalar degrees of freedom ( possibly coupled to fermions ) are amplified .",
    "if @xmath58 minimally coupled scalar field are present they can reheat the universe with a thermal distribution since their energy spectra , amplified because of the transition from the inflationary to the stiff phase , can thermalize thanks to non - graviational ( i.e. gauge ) interactions which get to local thermal equilibrium well below the planck energy scale . it can be also shown that the same discussion can be carried on in the case where the scalar degrees of freedom are simply non conformally coupled @xcite .",
    "suppose indeed that during the inflationary phase various scalar , tensor and vector degrees of freedom were present . unless one adopts some rather contrived points of view we have to accept that , in einsteinian theories of gravity , the only massless degrees of freedom to be amplified by a direct coupling to the background geometry are tensor fluctuations of the metric and non conformally coupled scalar fields since the evolutions equations of chiral fermions , gravitinos @xcite and gauge fields @xcite are invariant under a weyl rescaling of the metric tensor in a conformally flat background geometry as the one specified in eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) . of course",
    ", if the theory is not of einstein hilbert type this statement might be different .      the creation of massless quanta of the fields @xmath74 triggers an interesting possibility of gravitational reheating .",
    "since @xmath81 red - shifts faster than @xmath54 we have that there will be a moment , @xmath82 where the two energy densities will be of the same order . in the context of the present model this moment defines the onset of the radiation dominated phase .",
    "we can compute this moment by requiring that @xmath83 .",

    "we obtain @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number of spin degrees of freedom contributing to the thermal entropy after matter thermalization . amusingly enough",
    "this frequency is of the same order of the typical frequency of operation of lisa .",
    "it is also interesting to compute the present value of the frequency @xmath89 , with the result that @xmath90 the thermalization of the created quanta of the fields @xmath74 occurs quite rapidly , and its specific time is fixed by the moment at which the interaction rate becomes comparable with the hubble expansion rate during the stiff phase .",
    "the typical energy of the created quanta is of the order of @xmath91 .",
    "the particle density is of the order of @xmath92 . assuming that the created quanta interact through the exchange of gauge bosons ,",
    "then the typical interaction cross section will be of the order of @xmath93 .",
    "thus , imposing that at thermalization @xmath94 we get that @xmath95 , with @xmath96@xmath79 .",
    "the typical temperature associated with the transition from the stiff to the radiation dominated phase can be computed and it turns out to be @xmath97 if we do not fine - tune @xmath80 to be much smaller than @xmath98 in planck units and if we take into account that @xmath58 has to be typically large in order to be compatible with standard bbn ( see also section iii ) we have to conclude that @xmath99 is typically a bit larger than @xmath0 tev .",
    "we can characterize a generic graviton background in terms of three related ( and equally important ) physical observables .",
    "we can compute the ( present ) spectral energy density in critical units @xmath32 , but , for experimental applications , two other quantities can be defined , namely the _ power spectrum _ ( which will be denoted with @xmath100 ) and the _ spectral density _ @xmath101 . @xmath32 and @xmath100 are dimension - less whereas the spectral density is measured in seconds . in appendix",
    "a we give the precise mathematical definitions of these observables .",

    "( [ cobe ] ) and also the pulsar bound of eq .",

    "the _ indirect _ nucleosynthesis bound applies to the integrated spectrum and since in our case the spectral energy density increases sharply in the hard branch we have to conclude that the height of the peak can not be too large . in order to prevent the universe from expanding too fast at nucleosynthesis",

    "( [ pp ] ) we can argue that in order to detect a signal of the order of @xmath230 at a frequency of @xmath0 ghz , we would need a sensitivity of the order of @xmath231 .",
    "moreover as stressed in @xcite the thermal noise should be properly taken into account in the analysis of the outcome of these microwave detectors .",
    "indeed , as noticed from the very beginning @xcite , the thermal noise is one of the fundamental source of limitation of the sensitivity .",
    "an interesting strategy could be to decrease the operating frequency range of the device by going at frequencies of the order of @xmath0 mhz .",
    "based on the considerations of @xcite we can say that by taking high quality resonators the foreseen sensitivity can be as large as @xmath232 . this sensitivity , though still above our signal , would be quite promising .",
    "during an inflationary phase the evolution is not exactly of de sitter type . we want to understand how the slope of the energy density of the relic graviton background will be modified by the slow - rolling corrections for frequencies accessible to the forthcoming interferometers . in general the deviations from a de sitter stage",
    "can be induced either because of the specific inflationary model or because of the slow - rolling corrections whose strength can be described in terms of the so - called slow - rolling parameters @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the hubble parameter in cosmic time , @xmath43 is the inflaton and the dot denotes derivation with respect to cosmic time . in the slow rolling approximation the inflaton evolution is dominated by the scalar field potential according to the ( approximate ) equations @xmath235 in this approximation @xmath236 is not exactly constant but it slowly decreases leading to what we called quasi de sitter phase .",
    "the evolution equation of the mode function can be written , by using the definition of @xmath237 as @xmath238\\psi = 0 . \\label{sloromode}\\ ] ] as we can see , the time - dependent frequency appearing in the mode function contains two contribution : the first one ( i.e. @xmath239 ) is the term coming from a pure de sitter phase , the second one , proportional to @xmath237 , is the correction .    in short",
    "the logic is the following .",
    "the quasi de sitter phase modifies ( through and @xmath237-dependent correction ) the index of the hankel functions whose precise value ( equal to @xmath1 in the pure de sitter phase ) gets slightly smaller than @xmath1 . from the sign of the correction appearing in eq .",
    "( [ sloromode ] ) we can argue that the quasi de sitter nature of the inflationary phase will lead to a decrease in the slope of the energy spectrum .",
    "the question is how much the slope of the hard branch will be affected , or , more precisely , how much smaller than one will it be the slope of the hard branch of the graviton energy density .",
    "the answer to this question will of course depend upon the specific inflationary model since the size of the slow - rolling corrections can vary from one inflationary potential to the other .",
    "notice that our concern is different from the one usually present @xcite in the context of ordinary inflationary models where the slow - rolling corrections are taken into account in the soft branch of the spectra ( namely at sufficiently large scales ) .",
    "indeed , for flat spectra the most significant bounds come from the infra - red , whereas , in our case the most significant bounds are in the ultraviolet and we have to understand how the scales which re - enter in the stiff phase are affected by the quasi - de sitter nature of the inflationary phase . of course",
    ", we could also discuss the slow - rolling coprrections to the soft branch of our spectrum , but , they are , comparatively , less relevant ( for the structure of the spike ) than the correction to the hard branch .",
    "let us examine now the quasi - de sitter nature of different inflationary scenarios .",
    "an inflationary potential of chaotic form @xmath251 will lead to @xmath252 .",
    "let us take the value of @xmath237 the one corresponding to modes crossing the horizon around @xmath147@xmath253 e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "the reason for this choice is very simple .",
    "we want to understand how is modified the slope of the energy spectrum for scales larger than ( and of the order of ) the ones probed by the interferometers .",
    "a simple calculation shows that , for instance , the ligo / virgo scale crosses the horizon roughly @xmath254 e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "the end of inflation occurs when @xmath255 .",
    "thus , at the end of inflation @xmath256 . by solving consistently",
    "( [ sloroeq ] ) with the potential ( [ pot1 ] ) we get easily that the number of inflationary e - folds at a given value of @xmath43 is given by @xmath257 from this last equation we can determine easily @xmath258 and then , by inserting @xmath259 , @xmath237 turns out to be @xmath260 which is of the order of @xmath261 for @xmath262 , of the order of @xmath263 for @xmath264 and so on .",
    "another example could be the one of an exponential potential . using the definition of @xmath237 from eq .",

    "the spectral energy density will be @xmath267 the power spectrum and the associated spectral density can be computed from using the techniques already discussed in the previous sections .",
    "some authors call @xmath268 the corrections to the spectral index .",
    "( [ corr ] ) tells us that the corrections arising during a quasi - de sitter phase always go in the direction of making the maximal slope of the hard branch slightly smaller than one by a factor @xmath269 ( for instance in the case the case of @xmath270 potential ) . in the case of exponential potential",
    "the magnitude of the correction to the slope is controlled by @xmath271 .",
    "again we see that for reasonable values of @xmath271 like @xmath272 @xcite the correction are again small and , at most , of the order of few percents .",
    "in this paper we computed the relic graviton spectra in quintessential inflationary models .",
    "we showed that the energy spectra possess a hard branch which increases in frequency .",
    "large energy densities in relic gravitons can be expected in this class of models .",
    "the spike of the energy spectrum can be as large as @xmath273 at a typical ( present ) frequency @xmath274 ghz .",
    "the spectral amplitude at the interferometers frequencies is just below the value visible by the upgraded ligo detectors .",
    "since a large amount of energy density can be stored around the ghz the use of small electromagnetic detectors for the detection of such a background seems more plausible . in particular microwave cavities",
    "should be considered as a possible candidate .",
    "our investigation also hints that the sensitivities of the advanced ligo detectors to energy spectra increasing , in frequency , as @xmath275 should be precisely computed by convolving our spectra with the noise power spectra of the detectors .",
