    "in order to make our description of the background more concise we first introduce two assumptions , and formulate the forward and inverse problems .    _ assumption 1 : _ let @xmath1 @xmath2 be a bounded domain with a @xmath0 smooth boundary @xmath3 . also , let @xmath4 be a strictly positive hermitian matrix on @xmath5 with entries in @xmath6 and @xmath7 be either a real valued positive or complex valued function with positive real and imaginary parts on @xmath5 .",
    "further , let @xmath8 be a positive function on @xmath5 if @xmath9 is a real valued function and complex valued function on @xmath5 with non - positive imaginary part if @xmath9 is a complex valued function .",
    "in addition , if @xmath9 and @xmath10 have any discontinuities in their derivatives , we assume that they are away from @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the sobolev space of fractional differential order @xmath14 in the @xmath15 sense .",
    "now for given dirichlet data @xmath16 , we consider the following boundary value problem : @xmath17+\\omega^2\\rho(x)u(x)=0 & \\mbox{in } \\omega,\\\\ u(x)=g(x )   & \\mbox{on } \\partial \\omega . \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    _ assumption 2 : _ when @xmath9 and @xmath10 are real valued function , we assume that @xmath18 is non - vibrating , that is with @xmath19 only admits a trivial solution .",
    "+ with the above given conditions in assumptions 1 and 2 on @xmath20 and @xmath21 , it is well known that there exists a unique solution @xmath22 to , where @xmath23 denotes the sobolev space of differential order @xmath24 in the @xmath25 sense . +",
    "_ the inverse problem : _ we consider the following problem . given the _",
    "interior measurement _ @xmath26 , the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath27 on @xmath3 , the coefficients @xmath28 on @xmath5 , identify @xmath9 in @xmath18 .",
    "+ in this paper we will mainly consider the above inverse problem whose goal is to identify @xmath9 .",
    "however at the end of the paper we will address a somewhat easier alternate inverse problem where we assume all of the conditions above except that @xmath9 is assumed known and our goal then will be to identify @xmath10 .",
    "natural questions , for both of our main inverse problem and the alternate inverse problem , are the uniqueness , stability and reconstruction of @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) from the measured data . here",
    "our main result is a stability result for @xmath9 given @xmath10 ( or @xmath10 given @xmath9 ) .",
    "there are two major backgrounds for this inverse problems .",
    "the one is coming from a newly developed imaging modality called mre ( magnetic resonance elastography ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "it produces movies of shear waves induced by a single frequency excitation .",
    "once a mathematical model of these waves is determined , analysis and mathematical algorithms can be developed , based on the mathematical model .",
    "the numerical implementation of the algorithms produces diagnostically useful images with the goal of adding to noninvasive medical diagnostic capabilities . in ( @xcite ) , e.g. , the advance , through mre , to produce early diagnosis of liver stiffness and fibrosis is described .",
    "mre is in the general class of hybrid or coupled physics imaging technologies where two physical principles , here mri and elastic wave propagation are combined to obtain a richer data set from which to obtain diagnostically rich images .",
    "the above boundary value problem with @xmath29 equal to the identity matrix @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the simplest pde ( partial differential equation ) model which is used to describe a component @xmath32 of a shear wave inside human tissue . in",
    ", @xmath33 is the angular frequency of the time harmonic vibration , @xmath34 , applied to a human body where @xmath35 is time .",
    "when @xmath29 is equal to the identity matrix @xmath30 , and @xmath10 is real the functions @xmath10 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the density , storage modulus and loss modulus of human tissue .",
    "the other is coming from hydrology .",
    "this corresponds to the case @xmath38 , and @xmath9 is a real valued @xmath6 function and @xmath39 , then this inverse problem has been studied in hydrology .",
    "next we discuss some known results . in the two dimensional case alessandrini ( @xcite ) gave a hlder stability result for identifying @xmath9 by analyzing the critical set , @xmath40 of , @xmath32 , the solution to the forward problem .",
    "further , if the zero on the right hand side of the partial differential equation in is replaced by a positive , hlder continuous function , @xmath41 , on @xmath5 , richter ( @xcite ) gave a lipschitz stability result , in any dimension , for identifying @xmath9 by showing the non - degeneracy of @xmath42 and using the maximum principle . it should be noticed that the assumption , on the positivity of @xmath41 , is a very strong assumption and is only a sufficient condition to guarantee the non - degeneracy of @xmath43 .",
    "this assumption replaces the need to analyze the critical set .",
    "a number of other results have been established where the analysis of the critical set for a single data set is avoided by making additional hypotheses .",
    "marching and elliptic algorithms for recovering an unknown real coefficient , @xmath9 , when @xmath10 is real and known in the interior , @xmath44 , @xmath32 is given in the interior , and it is propagating there to one fixed direction which means that derivative of u in this direction does not vanish there are presented in ( @xcite ) .",
    "another method for addressing the problem of recovering @xmath9 , when data sets @xmath32 can have critical points , is the use of multiple measurements whose input can be controlled .",
    "if we can have multiple measurements and control the input , then the reconstruction of @xmath9 was first given by nakamura - jiang - nagayasu - cheng ( @xcite ) using complex geometric optic solutions and linking them to the input data by solving a cauchy problem .",
    "in that paper , the regularity assumptions on @xmath9 , @xmath10 are just @xmath45 , @xmath46 . when it can be assumed that multiple measurements are given , a more systematic analysis , for a wide class of hybrid inverse problems , was recently done by bal - uhlmann ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in this work",
    "the given mathematical model is linearized and then : ( 1 ) a reconstruction scheme for identifying all the coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath10 of the linearized operator @xmath48 is presented ; and ( 2 ) a lipschitz stability result is given when the regularity assumptions on @xmath49 and @xmath10 are just hlder continuous on @xmath5 .    in the paper presented here , we are concerned with extending alessandrini s result to the higher dimensional case when @xmath9 is a complex valued function and @xmath50 . even in the two dimensional case and if @xmath9 is a real valued function , the cases @xmath39 and @xmath50 are quite different .",
    "one can see that alessandrini s argument breaks down for the case @xmath50 .",
    "as far as we know , there is not any stability result known for the case where @xmath9 is complex valued , where @xmath9 can have discontinuous second derivatives and only one measurement , @xmath32 , as opposed to multiple measurements , is given .",
    "we will show local hlder stability of our inverse problem identifying @xmath9 for the case @xmath9 is a complex valued @xmath51 function on @xmath52 and _ piecewise analytic _ in @xmath18 by assuming that @xmath10 is continuous on @xmath52 and piecewise analytic in @xmath18 and @xmath29 is positive hermitian and analytic .",
    "this third assumption is given more precisely as follows .",
    "we denote by @xmath53 ( resp .",
    "@xmath54 ) the set of complex valued @xmath55 functions on @xmath52 which are analytic ( resp .",
    "piecewise analytic ) in @xmath18 and now clarify our definition of piecewise analytic and further assumptions on @xmath56 . +    ( piecewise analytic ) a function @xmath41 is piecewise analytic in @xmath18 if there exists a compact subset @xmath57 in @xmath18 consisting of a finite disjoint union of closed smooth analytic hypersurfaces such that @xmath41 is analytic in @xmath58 and is locally extendable as an analytic function from one side of @xmath57 across to the other side .",
    "that is , for any @xmath59 , we can find an open neighborhood @xmath60 of @xmath61 with @xmath62 consisting of two connected components @xmath63 and @xmath64 for which @xmath41 in @xmath63 ( resp .",
    "@xmath64 ) analytically extends to @xmath60 .",
    "_ assumption 3 : _ let @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and the locations of the singularities of @xmath9 and @xmath10 be the same .",
    "here @xmath65 means that all the entries of @xmath68 matrix @xmath29 belong to @xmath69 .    with _ assumptions 1,2 , and 3",
    "_ it can be shown by using the theories of analytic pseudo - differential operators , the theories for coercive boundary value problems and the fact that when @xmath9 and @xmath10 are real we assume that we have a nonvibrating problem , that the unique solution @xmath70 to belongs to @xmath71 .",
    "this follows because the interior transmission problem can be transformed to a coercive boundary value problem for a system of equations by introducing the boundary normal coordinates in the neighborhood @xmath60 of @xmath72 ( see definition above ) so that we can reflect the component @xmath73 to the other side of @xmath57 where we have the component @xmath74 , and then apply the analytic hypo - ellipticity result given in chapters iii and v of @xcite to this coercive boundary value problem .    now let @xmath75 be a sufficiently small constant .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the notion of an admissible pair for functions on @xmath52 .",
    "+    ( admissible pair ) a pair @xmath76 of functions on @xmath52 is said to be admissible if there exist exceptional angles @xmath77 with @xmath78 @xmath79 such that , for any @xmath80 , @xmath81 here @xmath82 denotes the @xmath83-dimensional hausdorff measure .",
    "clearly the fact that @xmath84 follows from definition .",
    "in addition , we make the following remarks .",
    "_ remark : _ ( i ) here we give a sufficient condition in order that @xmath85 is an admissible pair : suppose there exists a non - negative constant @xmath86 satisfying @xmath87 then the pair @xmath76 becomes admissible .",
    "note also , as a particular case , real valued @xmath76 are always admissible .",
    "furthermore @xmath88 are always admissible if @xmath89 .",
    "( ii ) in addition to the lower bound on @xmath90 , given in the definition of admissible pair , we can also assume without loosing its generality that @xmath91 . to see this",
    "suppose that @xmath92 are the exceptional angles of the admissible pair @xmath93 for which ( [ eq : def - addmissible ] ) holds .",
    "we will show that if @xmath94 , there exists a @xmath95 with @xmath96 so that @xmath97 can be eliminated .",
    "suppose that no such @xmath95 exists for some @xmath94 .",
    "then @xmath98 holds for every @xmath95 where we set @xmath99 for convenience .",
    "clearly we have @xmath100 which contradicts the fact @xmath101 .    in order to state our main result , it is convenient to use the sobolev space @xmath102 of differential order @xmath103 in the @xmath104 sense with the norm @xmath105 .",
    "we also set @xmath106 .",
    "we denote by @xmath107 the solutions to the boundary value problem with @xmath108 and @xmath109",
    ".    then , we have our main result .",
    "( main theorem ) _ let @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath88 be an admissible pair and @xmath112 satisfy assumptions 1,2,3 , with @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",

    "if @xmath18 has an analytic smooth boundary and if @xmath119 is analytic in @xmath124 and all the coefficients of @xmath120 are analytic near @xmath124 , then we have the estimate _ ( [ eq::stability ] ) _ _ i__n which @xmath125 is replaced with @xmath126 .",
    "+    the succeeding sections are devoted to the proof of the main result and they are organized as follows .",

    "the proofs of these results are given in appendix .",
    "combining the three sets of estimates we finish proving the main result .",
