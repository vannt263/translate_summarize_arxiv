    "five decades of intense experimental and theoretical research have boosted the anderson impurity model ( aim ) @xcite far beyond the scope of the `` localized magnetic states in metals '' that it was initially designed for . in the first three decades ,",
    "its concept of a single level with on - site coulomb repulsion coupled to a host without electronic interactions was mainly used to describe magnetic transition metal impurities dissolved in otherwise nonmagnetic bulk metals .",
    "the last two decades extraordinary progress in nanotechnology , however , brought a myriad of new and rather surprising implementations of what in the meantime had become one of the theorists favourite toys , ranging from tunable quantum dots @xcite over carbon nanotubes @xcite and adsorbed organic molecules @xcite to single - electron @xcite or single - molecule transistors .",
    "@xcite    the vast majority of theoretical work , comprehensively reviewed in ref .  , focuses on aims with metallic hosts of large bandwidth . in the limit of infinite bandwidth",
    ", the exact static and thermodynamic properties can be deduced from the bethe ansatz solution .",
    "@xcite a powerful and versatile alternative is provided by the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) , @xcite recent extensions of which have also been able to address the dynamics of the model to excellent accuracy . @xcite    yet another field of application is the mott metal - to - insulator transition in high spatial dimensions : @xcite here , dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite reduces the at first sight unrelated problem of interacting electrons on a high - dimensional lattice to an effective aim immersed in a bath of identical sites whose properties have to be determined self - consistently .",
    "it was within this context that the possibility of an aim with a metallic host of narrow bandwidth was first evoked @xcite since it naturally arises , in the vicinity of the mott - hubbard transition , @xcite within the now widely accepted scenario of a metallic state surrounded by a preformed gap .",
    "@xcite at the time , w.  hofstetter and s.  kehrein argued , on grounds of their lanczos - determined single - particle spectra for a corresponding aim , @xcite that this incipient gap might be populated by localized states .",
    "although these states have not actually been observed _ inside _ the preformed gap of the infinite - dimensional hubbard model , recent high - resolution dynamic density - matrix renormalization group ( ddmrg ) data @xcite do indeed show very narrow features on the inner band edges of the hubbard satellites in the appropriate regime of interactions .",
    "independent from the relevance for the mott - hubbard transition , several questions about these sharp features may arise : ( i ) what are the underlying physical processes ?",
    "( ii ) do these processes depend on correlations within the dmft bath ?",
    "( iii ) why do these features disappear for both , small and large values of the coulomb repulsion ? ( iv )",
    "are they related  and if yes , in which manner  to the series of peaks observed in the low - energy sector of lanczos - determined spectra of an aim with a correlationless narrow - band host ?",
    "@xcite and ( v ) why , in the latter case , are the peaks organized in a four - set structure ?    some of the above questions have already been addressed in a previous article , @xcite in which the aim was mainly studied perturbatively about the noninteracting limit ; others , in particular those concerning the rich low - energy structure at moderate interaction strengths or the strong - coupling kondo regime , lie out of reach for perturbative approaches and remain unanswered thus far . it is these questions , among others , that shall be addressed in the present article , primarily within the framework of the so - called local moment approach ( lma ) .",
    "this nonperturbative many - body green function formalism , developed by d.  logan and co - workers , @xcite introduces the concept of local moments from the outset . at pure mean - field level",
    ", this would lead to a doubly degenerate ground - state , as appropriate for an insulator , but in manifest contradiction to the kondo singlet observed for impurities hosted in metals .",
    "the lma aims to transcend this deficiency by accounting for dynamical tunneling processes between the two mean - field ground - states , at a rate which has to be determined in consistency with fermi - liquid behaviour on the lowest energy scale .",
    "the resulting formalism is equally well adapted to impurities in metallic @xcite and insulating @xcite hosts , be it in the particle - hole symmetric limit @xcite or away from it .",
    "@xcite the lma has so far been applied and adapted to a variety of impurity and lattice problems with strong electronic correlations , where its ability to cope with essentially all interaction regimes and to correctly describe all energy scales has proven very valuable .",
    "@xcite in the present case of an impurity hosted in a narrow band , the lma has to be generalized by using a renormalized , sum - rule compliant version of the original ladder - sum propagator for the transverse spin fluctuations .",
    "this extension is necessary , especially in the regime of moderate interaction strengths , to correctly capture the subtle low - energy dynamics ( see secs .",
    "[ sec : pi ] and [ sec : spectra_medu ] ) .",
    "the article is outlined as follows : after a brief presentation of the model , sec .  [",
    "sec : mf ] defines the narrow - band regime and presents two different mean - field solutions .",
    "[ sec : lma ] starts with a review of the lma , followed by a discussion of the physically relevant transverse spin fluctuations and of two important sum rules for the associated polarization propagator ; its last paragraph is dedicated to the self - energy approximation implemented in practice .",
    "[ sec : spectra ] presents the lma impurity spectra for different regimes defined by the strength of the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath0 ; the spectra are compared to corresponding hartree - fock or perturbation theory results and , where available , to hofstetter and kehrein s lanczos - determined spectra .",

    "by analogy with an @xmath39 molecule , these poles can be viewed as a bonding and an anti - bonding orbital , thus suggesting that the narrow host band to which the impurity is coupled behaves effectively as a single site or level .",

    "@xcite moreover , the observed kondo resonance has been shown to possess the universal shape and scaling properties characteristic for symmetric aims with a metallic host .",
