    "as one of the most complex human constructions , the internet is a challenging system to model .",
    "dynamic processes of different time - scales operate simultaneously  from slow processes , like the development of new hardware , to the transport of data , which occurs at the speed of light .",
    "these phenomena are to some extent interdependent .",
    "traffic provides income to the service providers which is then invested in infrastructure , which can lead to changes in traffic patterns .",
    "this paper describes an agent - based model ( abm ) that attempts to reproduce large - scale features of the autonomous system ( as ) level of the internet by modeling localized and well - understood network interactions .",
    "the ases of the internet lend themselves naturally to discrete abm models  @xcite .",
    "each as is an economic agent , comprised of a spatially discrete network . over time",
    ", ases create new links to other ases , upgrade their carrying capacity , and compete for customer traffic . the agents in the model described here ,",
    "behave similarly , although we have simplified as much as possible .",
    "specifically , the model is designed to be both simple and general enough to simulate any spatially extended communication network built by subnetworks of economically driven agents .    in previous work ,",
    "et al . _",
    "showed that incorporating economics and geography into the highly - optimized tolerance ( hot )  @xcite model increases the model s accuracy  @xcite . a related abm model of the as graph produces degree distributions similar to empirical observations  @xcite .",
    "bar  _ et al .",
    "_  proposed a similar model  @xcite , that incorporates another aspect of the real internet  that the agents are spatially extended objects .",
    "our model is similar in scope to this earlier work but differs in the details , most importantly by adding explicit economics ( cost ) to the model .",
    "other differences include accounting for population density , simplifying the treatment of traffic flow , and not assuming a hot framework .",
    "the previous work in this area , like much research on network models , focuses almost exclusively on degree distributions of the graphs . in this paper",
    ", we compare our results to internet data using several topological measures  @xcite , including degree distributions , as well as geography and traffic dynamics .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we describe and motivate the model . then",
    ", we characterize the time evolution , network topology , correlation between network structure and traffic flow , packet routing statistics , and geographical aspects of the networks produced by the model . where possible , we compare the properties of these synthetic networks to observed data from the internet .",
    "we begin with the fundamental unit responsible for network growth , an agent with economic interests  @xcite .",
    "these agents manage traffic over a geographically extended network ( which we refer to as a _ sub - network _ to distinguish it from the network of ases ) and profit from the traffic that flows through their network .",
    "we compare the agents to the ases that comprise the internet .",
    "this is not an exact mapping ",
    "some of the internet service providers ( isps ) have many as numbers ( e.g. , at&t ) , while other ases are shared by several organizations .",
    "we make the common simplifying assumption that once an agent is introduced , it does not merge with another agent or go bankrupt  @xcite .",
    "this is partially justified by the fact that the internet , from its inception , has grown monotonically , and we seek to capture this dynamic in our model most other models of the as graph enforce strict growth  @xcite as well and are , as ours , justified by their _ a posteriori _ ability to reproduce measured features .",
    "we assume a network user population distributed over a two - dimensional area .",
    "traffic is simulated by a packet - exchange model , where a packet s source and destination are generated with a probability that is a function of the population profile .",
    "the model is initialized with one agent comprised of a network ( a sub - network in our terminology ) that spans one grid location ( referred to as a _ pixel _ of the landscape . as time progresses , the agent may extend its subnetwork to other pixels , so that the sub - networks reach a larger fraction of the population .",
    "this creates more traffic , which generates profit , which is then reinvested into further network expansion . through positive feedback",
    ", the network grows until it covers the entire population . in this section",
    "we describe the assumptions and most of the details of the model ; the source code is publicly available from www.csc.kth.se/@xmath0pholme / asim/.    an agent @xmath1 is associated with a set of locations @xmath2 ( representing sources or end - points of traffic , and peering points ) , a capacity @xmath3 ( limiting the rate of packets that can pass through the agent ) , a packet - queue @xmath4 , and a set of neighbor agents @xmath5 .",
    "a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for two agents to be connected is that their locations overlap at , at least , one pixel .",
    "the locations exist on an @xmath6 square grid .",
    "a pixel of the grid is characterized by its population @xmath7 and the set of agents with a presence there @xmath8 . the total number of agents is denoted by @xmath9 , and the number of links between agents by @xmath10 .",
    "these quantities , except @xmath11 and @xmath12 , depend on the simulation time .",
    "the outer loop of the model then iterates over the following steps :    1 .",
    "[ step : nwk ] _ network growth . _",
    "the number of agents is increased .",
    "existing agents expand geographically , and their capacities are adjusted .",
    "[ step : traffic ] _ network traffic .",
    "_ packets are created , propagated toward their targets , and delivered . this process is repeated @xmath13 times before the next network - growth step .",
    "we measure simulation time @xmath14 as the number of times step  [ step : nwk ] is executed ( the time unit between packet movements is @xmath15 ) . in the remainder of this section",
    "we describe the growth and traffic steps in greater detail .",
    "the income of an agent , during a time step , is proportional to the traffic propagated by the agent during the period .",
    "this is a simplification  in a more detailed simulation one could let the income depend both on the amount of traffic , and the prices for forwarding the packets set by business agreements",
    ". assume an agent @xmath1 has a budget @xmath16 that it tries to invest so that it can increase its traffic , and thus its profit .",
    "since there is a possibility of congestion in the model , agent @xmath1 tries first to remove bottlenecks by increasing its capacity @xmath3 ( the number of packets that the agent can transit during one time step ) . when the capacity is sufficient , the agent spends the rest its budget on increasing its traffic by expanding geographically .",
    "there are three prices associated with network growth .",
    "first , the capacity price @xmath17the price of increasing @xmath3 one unit . for simplicity",
    "we let @xmath17 be independent of the size of the agent s subnetwork .",
    "second , the wire price @xmath18 .",
    "this is the price per pixel between a new location and the agent s closest existing location .",
    "last , the cost @xmath19 to connect two agents with locations at the same pixel .",
    "it has been observed that the average degree ( number of neighbors of an as ) in the as graph is relatively constant over time  @xcite .",
    "we take this as a constraint in our model and let the desired average agent degree @xmath20 be a control parameter .",
    "we also assume that each agent tries to spend all of its budget , but not more than that , whenever it is updated .",
    "the network growth step iterates over the following steps :    1 .",
    "[ step : add_as ] _ increase of the number of agents .",
    "_ as long as the network is too dense ( i.e.  if @xmath21 ) , new agents are added .",
    "new agents are situated in the pixel @xmath22 that has the highest available population @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the cardinality of @xmath8 and @xmath25 .",
    "the budget and capacity of the new agents are initialized to @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "+ if the network is small , @xmath28 , it is not dense enough for new agents to be added in step  [ step : add_as ] .",
    "thus , we do not apply this condition when @xmath9 is less than a threshold @xmath29 and call the time when @xmath30 is reached @xmath31 .",
    "[ step : capacity ] _ capacity increase .",
    "_ each agent synchronously increases its subnetwork s capacity based upon traffic from the last time step ( but not more than the agent can afford ) .",
    "agent @xmath1 invests the minimum of ( @xmath16 , @xmath32 , 0 ) to increase capacity ( @xmath33 is the change in traffic propagated by @xmath1 since the last update ) .",
    "[ step : link ] _",
    "link addition .",
    "_ while @xmath34 ( which usually means @xmath35 times ) , choose two agents randomly that are not already connected and share a common pixel . if the budgets of both agents are larger than @xmath19 , then connect them .",
    "[ step : extend ] _ spatial extension .",
    "_ let the agents with remaining budget to spend extend their networks .",
    "iterate through all agents @xmath1 and add a location at the pixel , not in @xmath2 , that has the highest available population @xmath36 , and is not further than @xmath37 from a location in @xmath2 ( i.e. , not further from @xmath1 than @xmath1 can afford ) .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : nwk](b ) ) .",
    "an alternative location selector might select the point which has the lowest cost per unit of population .",
    "unfortunately , such an algorithm is computationally prohibitive for modeled networks of the internet s scale .",
    "the cost of each agent modification mentioned above is immediately deducted from the budget of the agent .",
    "we model traffic with a discrete , packet - exchange model  @xcite .",
    "the packets are generated with specific source and target pixels , but the routing takes place on the network of agents .",
    "we neglect intradomain routing between the agent s locations , assuming the time it takes for a packet to pass through an agent is independent of the specific locations it visits .",
    "the dynamics are defined as follows :    1 .",
    "[ step : create ] _ packet generation .",
    "_ we assume that most traffic originates from direct communication between individuals and does not depend on the distance between them .",
    "so , for each pair of points @xmath38 $ ] on the grid , we create a packet with source @xmath22 and destination @xmath39 with probability @xmath40",
    ". then one agent , selected at random from the agents with a location at the pixel , is made the source node for the packet .",
    "the destination agent is randomly chosen from the agents at the destination pixel .",
    "finally , one unit of credit is added to the sender s budget .",
    "[ step : propagate ] _ packet propagation .",
    "_ each agent @xmath1 propagates the first @xmath3 packets from its queue ( of length @xmath41 ) each time step and receives one unit credit for each propagated packet .",
    "a packet can propagate only one hop ( inter - as transmission ) per time step .",
    "a packet at agent @xmath1 is propagated to a neighbor @xmath42 with probability @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 is the recipient as , @xmath45 is the graph distance , and @xmath46 is a parameter controlling the deviation from shortest - path routing  @xcite observed in ref .",
    "[ step : delete ] _ packet delivery .",
    "_ for all agents , delete all packets that have reached their target .",
    "the assumption , in step  [ step : create ] , that the probability that two agents communicate is independent of their spatial separation is in line with the ( somewhat debated ) `` death of distance '' in the internet age  @xcite .",
    "we also tested communication rates that decay with the square of the distance , as observed in conventional trade firms  @xcite , with qualitatively the same results .",
    "business agreements between ases are an important factor in the border gateway protocol ( bgp )  @xcite ( the internet s largest scale routing protocol ) .",
    "next hops are often selected by cost , rather than path length .",
    "we do not explicitly include inter - as contractual agreements , but our probabilistic propagation method  [ step : propagate ] has a similar effect on average path length  @xcite .",
    "before presenting the simulation results , we describe the experimental design , and choice of parameters .",
    "first , we specify a population profile @xmath7 .",
    "we primarily model population distributions , but we also model specific geographic populations ( e.g. u.s.a .",
    "census data ) . to simplify the generation of population distributions ,",
    "we neglect spatial correlations and simply model the frequency of population densities .",
    "this frequency has two important features : it is skewed ( pixels with low population densities are more frequent than highly populated pixels ) and fat - tailed ( there are pixels with a population density many orders of magnitude larger than the average ) .",
    "one probability distribution with such features is the power - law distribution @xmath47 . to reduce the fluctuations between different realizations of @xmath48 , and prevent unrealistically high populations within a pixel",
    ", we sample the power - law distribution in the bounded interval @xmath49 $ ]  @xcite with @xmath50 .",
    "our results do not depend strongly on the distribution @xmath7 .",
    "we obtain qualitatively similar result with normally distributed @xmath51-values and real population - density maps ( data not shown ) .",
    ".default parameters values for simulation experiments .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in multiparameter , agent - based models , such as ours , a systematic investigation of the full parameter space is infeasible .",
    "parameters are , if possible , obtained from real systems .",
    "we set the desired degree @xmath52 as observed in ref .  @xcite . unless otherwise stated , the desired size of the network is @xmath53 , which is the same order of magnitude as the real as graph .",
    "other parameters are balanced to keep runtime low ( less than one day ) while still engaging all aspects of the algorithm .",
    "this means , for example , that between every network update , a significant number of packets are routed through even the smallest agents , and enough packages to cause congestion pass through larger agents .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we use the parameter set given in table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "many of the results we show are from a single run , we have confirmed that the results are representative by comparing them with 20 other runs .",
    "we begin by studying the growth of the network over time . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tme](a ) we plot the number of agents and links as a function of simulation time for one representative run . at @xmath54 the graph is sparser than @xmath20 .",
    "initially , the agents spend the budget they accumulate on new links ( and increasing capacity ) . around @xmath55 ,",
    "the budget of the wealthier agents is sufficient to invest in wires to new locations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tme](b ) ) .",
    "this creates new traffic , which causes positive feedback accelerating the traffic flow , coverage , budget , and also more congestion .",
    "around @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 change from exponential to sub - exponential growth . as we see below , this is also the time when a significant level of congestion appears in the system . at about the same time , the entire population is serviced by the network . with the current model",
    ", the network would grow indefinitely but with decreasing returns for the agents .",
    "alternatively one could introduce maintenance costs proportional to network size , in which case the network would reach a steady state where the budgets of the agents are balanced and no further investments can be made .",
    "for @xmath59 the increase of @xmath57 is slower than exponential .",
    "this is explained by the increasing level of congestion in the system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tme](c ) we plot the average time @xmath60 for a packet to travel from source to destination .",
    "@xmath60 is bounded from below by the average distance ( number of links in the shortest path , averaged over pairs of nodes ) @xmath61 .",
    "the two curves diverge , i.e.  a significant level of congestion appears , around @xmath62 .",
    "the growth of @xmath57 and @xmath58 slows down at the same point .",
    "we conclude that growth slowdown comes from a congestion - driven negative feedback .",
    "the most striking feature of network growth over time is the transition from a small network , almost constant in size , to a rapidly increasing system ( around @xmath63 ) .",
    "this effect is typical for technologies emerging from the interactions of a large number of agents  they need a _",
    "critical mass _ of users to reach a significant fraction of the total population .",
    "one can argue that the internet reached this critical mass in the early 1980 s when it started to span the globe .",
    "another important point in the internet s history was the advent of the world wide web ( www ) in the early 1990 s , and with it commercial applications and access to the general public .",
    "our model does not include applications , such as the www , that undeniably affect network growth .",
    "such effects could be included by adopting a different traffic model , but for this paper we aim at simplicity and generality . in the internet",
    "the growth of the number of ases is slower than the exponential increase of agents predicted by the model ( bgp.potaroo.net/cidr/ ; read january 7 , 2008 ) .",
    "one reason for the faster growth is that we do not assume that maintenance costs are proportional to income  if such costs grow super - linearly , negative feedback could dampen growth . other external factors , such as the fact that as numbers are allocated and assigned by a central authority ( internet assigned numbers authority , www.iana.org ) , might also influence the actual rate of growth experienced by the internet .",
    "one of the most conspicuous network structures of as - graphs is its skewed degree distribution ( first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , compatible with a power - law functional form  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deg](a ) we compare the cumulative degree distribution of our model with that of the internet s .",
    "we use the model network from the example run described earlier ( taking data from the simulation when @xmath64 ) , and the `` as06 '' network of ref .",
    "@xcite ( an as - graph constructed from www.routeviews.org and www.ripe.net , with @xmath65 ) . the match between the model and the real networks is striking .",
    "preliminary studies indicate that the slope of the curve is largely insensitive to changes in parameter values .",
    "we compare this result with a generic network model that produces power - law degree distributions ( the barabsi  albert ( ba ) model  @xcite ) and a simple , geographic model of the as - graph designed by fabrikant , koutsoupias , and papadimitriou ( fkp )  @xcite .    the ba model is a growth model in which one node ( and @xmath10 links to attach it with the rest of the network ) is added every time step . _ preferential attachment _ is used to determine the endpoints of the new links  the probability of attaching to a node of degree @xmath66 is proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "the fkp model is also a simple growth - model .",
    "each time step , one node , and a link attached to it , is added to the graph .",
    "a new node @xmath1 is assigned random coordinates in the unit square and attached to the old node @xmath42 that minimizes latexmath:[$d_0(j)+\\alpha    distance between @xmath42 and the node added first , @xmath68 is the euclidean distance between @xmath1 and @xmath42 , and @xmath69 is a parameter setting the cost - balance between making new physical connections or using the existing network ) .    in figs .  [",
    "fig : deg](b ) and ( c ) we plot the cumulative mass function of degree for one ba and one fkp network .",
    "the model parameter values were chosen to give networks as close as possible to the real as - graph ( @xmath70 for the ba model , @xmath71 for the fkp model , and @xmath65 for both ) .",
    "the slope of the ba model is steeper than the real network , and the curve for the fkp - model is flatter than the real data . to compare the goodness - of - fit ,",
    "since the curves have a similar range in @xmath72 , we measure the ratio @xmath73 of the area between the curves and the area ( in the @xmath74-space ) spanned by the extreme values of @xmath75 and @xmath72 .",
    "we find @xmath76 for our model , @xmath77 for the ba model , and @xmath78 for the fkp model .",
    "although both the ba and fkp models hae been extended to yield better data fits  @xcite , the original forms of the models illustrate two important components of internet growth , namely the rich - gets - richer effect driving the growth of the ba model and the spatial trade - off effect of the fkp model .",
    "a combination of these effects may explain why our model s degree distribution , and the curve of the real network , lies between those of the original ba and fkp models . in our model",
    ", the degrees of nodes do not directly affect the creation of new links .",
    "however , preferential attachment occurs indirectly via positive feedback ",
    "nodes with large degree acquire more traffic , and thus more budget which they can reinvest in more connections , thus increasing their degree .",
    "the effect of preferential attachment in the model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deg](d ) , which is a plot of the probability density of a node s traffic load given its degree . because an agent s income is correlated with the traffic that it propagates , and a larger budget will increase the possibility of creating new links",
    ", there is positive feedback between the degree and the rate of degree increase , i.e.  a form of preferential attachment .",
    "note that the correlation in fig .",
    "[ fig : deg](d ) is not linear ( the slope is different from the solid line s ) .",
    "it is known that nonlinear preferential attachment does not give a power - law degree distribution  @xcite ( which we seem to have ) , so preferential attachment is not the only factor affecting our network s growth .",
    "( if we had linear preferential attachment , the slope of @xmath79 would , furthermore , be the same as the ba model . )",
    "structually , the as graph is hierarchically ordered  @xcite  engineers and network operators speak of the first , second and third tier . for the model networks ,",
    "we measure a node s position in the hierarchy by its network centrality  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad ] we diagram the average fraction of nodes and the average degree as functions of the average distance @xmath80 to other nodes in the network ( @xmath80 is the inverse of a centrality measure , known as _ closeness centrality _ , so more central nodes are to the left in the diagrams ) . by this method",
    "we can get a _ radial _ picture of the as graph structure from the center to the periphery . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad](a)(c ) we plot the fraction of vertices at different @xmath80-values .",
    "we note that our model resembles the real as - graph more closely than the ba and fkp models .",
    "having peaks ( roughly corresponding to the tiers of the internet ) like the observed as - graph .",
    "the shift to the left of the model curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : rad](a ) can , to some extent , be explained by its smaller size ( larger networks have larger average distances , leading to a curve displaced to the right ) . in brief , the ba model lacks the complex periphery of the real as - graph ( the density is more balanced , compared with the left - skewed curve of the real - world network ) . the average degree as a function of @xmath80 is less right - skewed in the ba model compared with the empirical network .",
    "just like the degree distribution , the fkp model deviates from the real network in the opposite way compared to the ba model  the high degree nodes of the fkp model are extremely concentrated to the center of the network .      in section  [ subsec : growth_results ] we investigated network topology and its growth . in this section",
    "we study traffic flow and how network topology affects it . in the internet",
    ", packets do not necessarily travel the shortest distances between source and destination .",
    "most importantly , business agreements between agents arrange agents into a hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "the business contracts put constraints on how packets are routed  for example , usually a packet can not first be routed downwards ( to customers ) , then upwards ( to providers ) , in the hierarchy , even if that is a shorter path ( known as the valley free rule ) . gao and wang  @xcite investigated the extra distance @xmath81 packets need to travel due to such reasons .",
    "they found a decaying probability distribution of @xmath81 , meaning that most of the traffic actually travels via shortest paths . in our model",
    "we do not have explicit business agreements that cause hierarchical routing into the core of the network , and out again .",
    "it is , however , true for most graphs that a vast majority of shortest paths pass a restricted core of the graph  @xcite , and our traffic model routes most traffic via short ( if not the shortest ) paths .",
    "the @xmath81 distribution of our model ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lbc](a ) ) matches the observation of gao and wang  @xcite .",
    "we proceed to investigate the relationship between graph centrality and traffic density .",
    "this can tell us something about how congestion and fluctuations affect routing  @xcite . if all agents have sufficient capacity for packets to always route along shortest paths , then traffic density along a link @xmath82 will be proportional to its _ betweenness centrality _",
    "@xmath83 where @xmath84 is the number of shortest paths between nodes @xmath1 and @xmath42 passing through the link @xmath82 , and @xmath85 is the total number of shortest paths between @xmath1 and @xmath42 . if an as is congested , the traffic through its links will be lower than anticipated by the betweenness of the edge . thus , congestion patterns can be illustrated by studying betweenness and traffic load .",
    "[ fig : lbc](b ) is a density plot of the actual traffic density as a function of betweenness of the links of the model network . for more central nodes ( higher",
    "betweenness ) , there is a strong correlation between betweenness and traffic density ",
    "the vertices with @xmath86 spans half a decade of @xmath87 . for the more peripheral nodes the correlation is less clear ( vertices with @xmath88 can have @xmath87-values of almost three orders of magnitude )",
    "indeed , there seems to be a separation of agents into two classes , one with capacity to keep the traffic flowing , another with too low capacity . for links of low betweenness the traffic ",
    "betweenness correlation is weak . to summarize",
    ", congestion does affect the system , and it is most pronounced for nodes carrying little , or intermediate , traffic levels .",
    "we briefly discuss the spatial network structure  another feature that emerges from our model . as an example , we ran the simulation on the population density profile of the united states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : usa](a)(d ) we show the growth of the largest agent for a run with @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "lines are drawn between each node ( pixel ) and the agent s nearest node at the time of the node s addition . in this representation",
    "the length of the lines are proportional to the wire cost .",
    "[ fig : usa](e ) and ( f ) plot the locations of tier  1 exchange points of two major internet providers sprint and at&t ( adapted from ref .",
    "there are some similarities between these real networks and the model network of fig .",
    "[ fig : usa](d)all networks span the whole continent and have locations concentrated in urban areas . in future work",
    "we intend to make a statistical characterization of the spatial aspects of the networks produced by our model .",
    "we have presented a model of communication networks that , like the as - level internet , is built of spatially extended subnetworks that have an interest in increasing the traffic running through them .",
    "our model networks grow slowly until they reach a critical mass where an approximately exponential growth begins ; they match the degree distribution of real networks and the radial statistics closely .",
    "the degree distribution of the model , and the real world lies between the distributions of the pure ba and fkp models .",
    "since the model incorporates aspects of both the ba and fkp models we hypothesize that , the explanation for the degree distribution of the model , and the real world , is a combined result of preferential attachment ( of the ba model ) and geographically constrained optimization ( of the fkp model ) .",
    "we are able to recreate the traffic characteristic observed in real internet traffic .",
    "if we run the model on the us population density map many features of the backbone of large , real agents are recreated .",
    "the different aspects of the model ( traffic , geography , and agents trying to increase the traffic they relay ) all affect the output . in this paper",
    "we do not scrutinize the model s parameter dependence , although preliminary studies indicate that the speed of growth ( quantified by e.g.  the time to reach the critical density ) is strongly dependent on both the wire and attachment prices , the population density profile ( a more clumped population distribution produces faster growth ) , and their desire to communicate . on the other hand ,",
    "the network topology is rather insensitive to the population distribution , and also not very dependent on how sources and destinations are generated ( e.g. , introducing a distance dependence does not matter much ) .",
    "the specific layout of the network is , however , dependent on population profile .",
    "many interesting extensions of the basic model are possible .",
    "one interesting extension would , for example , be to include business agreements between the different agents ( similar to ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or change the traffic patterns from the person  to  person communication of the present model to a situation with more traffic coming from central servers .",
    "it might also be interesting to model intra - as routing .",
    "many of today s ases employ `` hot - potato '' routing and transfer packets to the next as as quickly as possible , to reduce cost .",
    "alternative intra - as routing strategies , such as routing the packet as close to the destination as possible , could be tested within the model s framework .",
