    "magnetic reconnection is the process of changing magnetic field - line connectivity in highly conducting plasmas ,  @xcite and is usually associated with the conversion of a large amount of magnetic energy into plasma kinetic energy",
    ". the question of how fast magnetic flux can be reconnected in large and weakly collisional systems is important in space weather modelling ,  @xcite magnetic confinement fusion devices ,  @xcite and the understanding of many astrophysical phenomena .",
    "a significant number of non - linear simulation studies have considered this question with both fully kinetic and a number of reduced fluid models .",
    "one key result from these studies was that the hall - mhd fluid model , in which ion inertia is responsible for setting the ion diffusion region thickness , was able to reproduce the reconnection rates of fully kinetic simulations .",
    "@xcite the reconnection rate did not depend on the detailed kinetic physics of electrons or ions ,  @xcite since this physics is absent in the hall - mhd model .",
    "the majority of these studies used the harris - sheet set - up ,  @xcite in which a pre - formed current sheet is often highly unstable due to its kinetic scale thickness and macro - scale length .",
    "further , such a system does not include important features that are present in real reconnecting systems , such as the formation of the current sheet , and its coupling to a large scale system that supplies the magnetic flux to the reconnection site .",
    "the magnetic island coalescence problem  @xcite naturally includes such features , since the flux is supplied by two macro - scale magnetic islands and a current sheet forms self - consistently between the islands as they collide .",
    "such magnetic islands are two - dimensional representations of magnetic flux ropes , a fundamental building block of magnetised plasmas .  @xcite the interaction of islands , or flux - ropes , is thought to be a common process in the solar corona , the solar wind and the earth",
    "s magnetosphere . in particular",
    ", island coalescence has been inferred both by indirect observations of coronal mass ejections ,  @xcite and by in - situ detection in the magnetotail .",
    "@xcite    recent simulation studies  @xcite have revisited the conclusions from earlier current layer studies using the island coalescence problem set - up .",
    "it was found that the hall - mhd model was unable to reproduce the geometry of the ion diffusion region , the upstream magnetic field ` pile - up ' strength , the outflow velocity , or the reconnection rate including its dependence on ion temperature or system size .",
    "@xcite further , these differences lead to different global evolution of the system - for hall - mhd the islands merge when they first approach , but for the fully kinetic model the islands bounce off each other to give a much longer timescale for merging .",
    "ion kinetic physics , and in particular the anisotropic and agyrotropic nature of the ion pressure tensor , was identified as the crucial physics missing from the hall - mhd model .",
    "a hybrid model with mass - less fluid electrons and kinetic ions was able to reproduce many of the full kinetic results .    in the present study ,",
    "the sensitivity of these results to the addition of a finite guide field is considered .",
    "such a guide field is not reconnected , but it can modify the orbits of ions and electrons around the reconnection site .",
    "it is found that the reconnection rate , pile - up magnetic field , and outflow velocity increase with guide field for a limited range of guide field strengths that are applicable to the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "the hall - mhd model is able to reproduce the fully kinetic reconnection rate only in the limit of strong guide fields , when the ion pressure tensor physics becomes sufficiently localised around the x - point and the ion inertia is responsible for setting the ion diffusion region thickness . for large systems with kinetic ions",

    "there is a much weaker increase in pile - up for the hybrid run with @xmath206 , where signatures of this instability are very weak .",
    "the absence of the instability in this hybrid run may be due to the use of isotropic electron pressure , which means that only ion pressure anisotropy can contribute to the drive .",
    "for example , with the plasma parameters stated above but with isotropic electrons @xmath252 the growth rate is reduced by almost a factor of 2 to @xmath253 .",
    "for a larger hybrid run with @xmath234 we do see structures in @xmath251 and the magnetic field that are very similar to those in fig .

    "@xmath257 is there qualitative agreement in the physics setting the ion diffusion region thickness , where ion inertia is the first term to break the frozen - in condition for ions in both the hall - mhd and kinetic models . at the x - point",
    ", this guide field is sufficient to suppress meandering motion , so that the distribution function becomes to lowest order gyrotropic around the guide field direction .",
    "the outflow jet speed is reduced significantly with respect to the upstream ion alfvn speed @xmath258 in the zero guide - field kinetic case due to a quasi - viscous effect associated with the non - gyrotropic part of the ion pressure tensor . for @xmath124",
    "there are still significant differences in the strength of the ion stress tensor and total pressure contributions to momentum balance between hall - mhd and kinetic , but these terms mostly cancel so that they do not influence the outflow speed .",
    "the magnetic tension is balanced by ion inertia to give an outflow speed comparable to @xmath258 .    for the island coalescence problem",
    ", small changes of the peak reconnection rate can have larger consequences on the evolution of the system .",
    "if the reconnection rate is too slow , the islands can bounce off each other and reconnection can be temporarily switched off until the islands come together again .",
    "it is found that in large kinetic systems , islands with strong guide field have larger average reconnection rates and merge on a faster timescale than those with zero guide field .",
    "in addition to the changes in outflow velocity and ion diffusion region geometry with guide field that are present in small systems , large fully kinetic systems with guide field are also unstable to repeated formation of secondary magnetic islands which may play a role in limiting the length of the reconnection layer . also , the presence of a mirror - like instability found in the largest zero guide field kinetic systems may further reduce the reconnection rate , but further work is needed to confirm this conclusion .",
    "this instability is not present in the strong guide field runs .",
    "reconnection events at the earth magnetosphere can have a wide range of guide fields , but in the earth s magnetotail it is often small  @xcite compared with the reconnecting field .",
