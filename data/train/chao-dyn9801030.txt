    "the prediction of the future state of a system known the actual state is a fundamental problem with obvious applications in geophysical flows ( leith , 1975 ; leith and kraichnan , 1972 ; leith , 1978 ) .",
    "there are many limitations to the ability of predicting the state of a geophysical system , e.g. the atmosphere , one of the most important is the lack of knowledge , or the difficulty of full implementation , of the equations of motion . still ,",
    "even if one assume to perfectly know the system and to have sufficiently large computers , the predictability can be severely limited by the dynamics itself , i.e. the `` intrinsic unpredictability '' the a system which is the subject of our study .",
    "a well known , and very popular , example of low - predictable system is given by a chaotic system ( lorenz , 1963 ) . by definition ,",
    "chaotic dynamical systems display sensible dependence on initial conditions : two initially close trajectories will diverge exponentially in the phase space with a rate given by the leading lyapunov exponent @xmath0 ( see eckmann and ruelle , 1985 ) .",
    "because the initial condition can be measured only with a finite uncertainty @xmath1 , we can know the future state of the system at a tolerance level @xmath2 only up to a maximum time @xmath3 one important consequence of equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) is that the predictability time has a very weak dependence on the precision of the initial condition and on the tolerance , therefore the predictability time is an intrinsic quantity of the system as the lyapunov exponent is .    the naive formula ( [ eq:1 ] ) for the predictability problem holds only for infinitesimal perturbations and in non intermittent systems ; in the general case one has a series of problems and subtle points which have been objected of several studies in last years ( crisanti et al . , 1993 ;",
    "aurell et al . , 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "one delicate issue is particularly relevant for our present study and essentially says that , although the lyapunov exponent for the atmosphere ( as a whole ) is presumably rather large ( due to the small scale turbulence ) , the large scale behavior of the system can be forecasted with good accuracy for several days ( lorenz , 1969 ; lorenz , 1982 ; simmons et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "the apparent paradox comes from the identification of the predictability time with the inverse of the lyapunov exponent based on equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) which is actually of little relevance even in few degree - of - freedom dynamical systems .",
    "indeed , in presence of different characteristic time scales , as is the case in any realistic model of geophysical flows , the lyapunov exponent will be roughly proportional to the inverse smallest characteristic time .",
    "this time is associated to the smallest , low energy containing scales which , after the fast saturation , do not play a role any more in the error growth law .",
    "large errors will grow , in general , with the characteristic time of the largest , energy containing scales ( leith , 1971 ; leith and kraichnan , 1972 ) .",
    "thus when the initial error is not very small , as is often the case in a predictability experiment , the leading lyapunov exponent may play no role at all .    to be more quantitative , in this paper",
    "we investigate the predictability problem in two time scale dynamical systems .",
    "we apply a recently introduced generalization of the lyapunov exponent to finite perturbations .",
    "we will show that the finite size lyapunov exponent ( fsle ) is more suitable for characterizing the predictability of complex systems where the growth rate of large errors in not ruled by the lyapunov exponent .",
    "the models considered here are crude approximations of a realistic geophysical flow also because both the subsystems have a single time scale",
    ". it would be interesting to extend the investigation to more realistic situations and comparing the latter case with present results .",
    "this remaining of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:2 ] we introduce the finite size lyapunov exponent which is applied to the system models in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the notion of lyapunov exponent is based on the average rate of exponential separation of two infinitesimally close trajectory in the phase space : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the distance between the trajectories with a suitable norm and the two limits can not be interchanged .",
    "the standard algorithm ( benettin et al . , 1980 ) for computing the lyapunov exponent is based on ( [ eq : b1 ] ) , with the trick of periodical rescaling of the two trajectory in order to keep their distance `` infinitesimal '' .    as already discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the second limit in ( [ eq : b1 ] ) is of dubious interest in the predictability problem because the initial incertitude on the system variables is in general not infinitesimal .",
    "therefore one would like to relax the infinitesimal constrain still maintaining some well defined mathematical properties .",
    "recently , a generalization of ( [ eq : b1 ] ) which allows to compute the average exponential separation of two trajectories at finite errors @xmath1 have been introduced .",
    "the finite size lyapunov exponent , @xmath6 , is based on the concept of error growing time @xmath7 which is the time it takes for a perturbation of initial size @xmath1 to grow of a factor @xmath8 .",
    "the ratio @xmath8 should not be taken too large , in order to avoid the growth through different scales .",
    "the error growing time is a fluctuating quantity and one has to take the average along the trajectory as in ( [ eq : b1 ] ) .",
    "the finite size lyapunov exponent is then defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the natural measure along the trajectory and @xmath11 is the average over many realizations . for an exhaustive discussion on the way to take averages , see aurell et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    in the limit of infinitesimal perturbations",
    ", @xmath12 , definition ( [ eq : b2 ] ) reduces to that of the leading lyapunov exponent ( [ eq : b1 ] ) . in practice",
    ", @xmath6 displays a plateau at the value @xmath0 for sufficiently small @xmath1 .    to practically compute the fsle",
    ", one has first to define a series of thresholds @xmath13 , and to measure the time @xmath14 that a perturbation with size @xmath15 takes to grow up to @xmath16 .",
    "the time @xmath14 is obtained by following the evolution of the perturbation from its initial size @xmath17 up to the largest threshold @xmath18",
    ". this is done by integrating two trajectories of the system that start at an initial distance @xmath17 . in general",
    ", one must take @xmath19 , in order to allow the direction of the initial perturbation to align with the most unstable phase - space direction .",
    "the fsle , @xmath20 , is then computed by averaging the error growing times over several realizations according to ( [ eq : b2 ] ) .",
    "note that the fsle has conceptual similarities with the @xmath21-entropy ( kolmogorov , 1956 ; see also gaspard and wang , 1993 ) .",
    "this latter measures the bandwidth that is necessary for reproducing the trajectory of a system within a finite accuracy @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath21-entropy approach has already been applied to the analysis of simple systems and experimental data ( gaspard and wang , 1993 ) , giving interesting results .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath21-entropy is , however , much more expensive from a computational point of view and of little relevance for the predictability problem .",
    "the computation of the fsle gives information on the typical predictability time for a trajectory with initial incertitude @xmath1 . to be more quantitative",
    ", one can introduce the average predictability time from an initial error @xmath1 to a given tolerance @xmath2 as the average error growing time , i.e. @xmath22 which reduces to ( [ eq:1 ] ) in the case of constant @xmath23 . from general considerations ,",
    "one expects that @xmath6 is a decreasing function of @xmath1 and thus ( [ eq : b3 ] ) gives longer predictability time than ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "we now discuss the application of the fsle analysis to two relatively simple dynamical systems presenting different characteristic time scales .",
    "the proposed models are of little physical relevance ; they should rather be intended as prototypical models for the predictability problem in complex flows .",
    "the first example is obtained by coupling two lorenz models ( lorenz , 1963 ) , the first representing the slow dynamics and the second the fast dynamics @xmath24    the choice of the form of the coupling is constrained by the physical request that the solution remains in a bounded region of the phase space . since @xmath25",
    "if the trajectory is enough far from the origin , one has that it evolves in a bounded region of the phase space .",
    "the parameters have the values @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the latter giving the relative time scale between the fast and slow dynamics .",
    "the two rayleigh numbers are taken different , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , in order to avoid sincronization effects .    with the present choice",
    ", the two uncoupled systems ( @xmath31 ) display chaotic dynamics with lyapunov exponent @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively and thus a relative intrinsic time scale of order @xmath34 .    by switching on the couplings @xmath35 and",
    "@xmath36 we obtain a single dynamical system whose maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath0 is close ( for small couplings ) to the lyapunov exponent of the faster decoupled system ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we will consider a single realization of the couplings , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the global lyapunov exponent is found to be in this case @xmath40 which is indeed close to @xmath37 in the uncoupled case . with the present choice of the couplings , the fast dynamics",
    "is driven by means of the effective rayleigh number @xmath41 and one recognize in the time evolution the slow - varying component of the driver ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .    for",
    "what concern the predictability , one expect reasonably that for small coupling @xmath35 the slow component of the system @xmath42 remains predictable up to its own characteristic time .",
    "on the other hand , for any coupling @xmath43 we obtain a single dynamical system in which the errors grow with the leading lyapunov exponent @xmath44 .",
    "the apparent paradox stems from saturation effects which becomes apparent as soon as one is interested in non infinitesimal errors .",
    "we have integrated two trajectories of ( [ eq : c1 ] ) starting from very close initial conditions .",
    "one trajectory represents the `` true '' ( reference ) trajectory @xmath45 and the other is the forecast ( perturbed trajectory @xmath46 ) subjected to an initial error @xmath47 .",
    "the error is computed here by means of the euclidean distance in the phase space @xmath48^{1/2 } \\label{eq : c3}\\ ] ]    figure [ fig2 ] reports the results for the error growth averaged over @xmath49 experiments with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we observe that the relative magnitude of the initial errors is irrelevant for what concerns small errors because the error direction in the phase space will be rapidly aligned toward the most unstable direction . for small times ( @xmath52 ) , both the errors can be considered infinitesimal and the growth rate is thus given by the global lyapunov exponent @xmath0 .",
    "this is the linear regime of the error growth in which the lyapunov exponent is the relevant parameter for the predictability . for larger times",
    ", the fast component of the error , @xmath53 , reaches the saturation , the trajectories separation evolves according to the full non linear equations of motion and the growth rate for the slow component is strongly reduced . from figure [ fig2 ] one",
    "observes that the slow component error @xmath54 is still well below the saturation value , and grows with a rate close to its characteristic inverse time @xmath55 .",
    "we now apply the fsle algorithm to the slow component of the the error , @xmath54 ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we define a series of @xmath56 thresholds starting with @xmath57 and ratio @xmath58 .",
    "the results presented ( figure [ fig3 ] ) are obtained after averaging over @xmath59 realizations .",
    "for very small @xmath1 , the fsle recovers the leading lyapunov exponent @xmath0 , indicating that in small scale predictability the fast component has indeed a dominant role .",
    "as soon as the error grows above the coupling @xmath60 , @xmath6 drops to a value close to @xmath55 and the characteristic time of small scale dynamics is no more relevant .    in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we plot the slow component predictability time ( [ eq : b3 ] ) for a fixed initial error @xmath61 as a function of the tolerance @xmath2 .",
    "we observe , as expected , an enhancement of @xmath62 as soon as one accepts a tolerance larger than the typical fast component fluctuation in the slow time series .",
    "observe that the naive application of ( [ eq:1 ] ) would heavily underestimate the predictability time for large tolerance ( dashed line ) .",
    "we now consider the second example .",
    "it is a more complex system introduced by lorenz ( lorenz , 1996 ) as a toy model for the atmosphere dynamics which includes explicitly both large scales ( synoptic scales , slow component ) and small scales ( convective scales , fast component ) .",
    "the apparent paradox described above can be reformulated here by saying that a more refined atmosphere model ( which is able to capture the small scale dynamics ) would be less predictable of a rougher one ( which resolve only large scale motion ) and thus the latter should be preferred for numerical weather forecasting .",
    "we will see that also in this case , the effect of the small , fast evolving , scales becomes irrelevant for the predictability of large scale motion if one consider large errors .",
    "the model introduces a set of large scale , slow evolving , variables @xmath63 and small scale , fast evolving , variables @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 . as in ( lorenz , 1996 )",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions on @xmath67 ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) while for @xmath70 we impose @xmath71 .",
    "the equation of motion are @xmath72 in which @xmath73 again represent the relative time scale between fast and slow dynamics and @xmath74 is a parameter which controls the relative amplitude .",
    "let us note that ( [ eq : c4 ] ) has the same qualitative structure of a finite mode truncation of navier - stokes equation , with quadratic inertial terms and viscous dissipation .",
    "the coupling ( with unit strength ) is chosen in order to have the `` energy '' @xmath75 conserved in the inviscid , unforced limit .",
    "the forcing term drives only the large scales and we will consider @xmath76 which is sufficient for developing chaos .",
    "we have performed the computation of the fsle for system ( [ eq : c4 ] ) with parameters as in ( lorenz , 1996 ) : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 implying that the typical @xmath80 variable is 10 times faster and smaller than the @xmath81 variable . in this case",
    "we choose to adopt for measuring the errors the global euclidean norm on both the slow and fast variables ( energy norm ) : this is for mimic a realistic situation in which we are not able to recognize _ a priori _ the slow component in the system .",
    "the result of the fsle computation is displayed in figure [ fig5 ] after averaging over @xmath82 realizations with initial error @xmath83 .",
    "we set @xmath84 thresholds with @xmath85 and ratio @xmath86 .",
    "for very small errors we observe the saturation of @xmath6 to the leading lyapunov exponent of the system @xmath87 . for errors larger than the typical r.m.s .",
    "value of the fast variables ( @xmath88 ) we observe a second plateau at @xmath89 , corresponding to the inverse characteristic time of large scales .",
    "we observe that the relative time scale between fast and slow motions as computed by the fsle is slightly larger than the value of the parameter @xmath73 .",
    "we think that this effect is due to coupling which here can not be assumed small as in the previous example .",
    "in figure [ fig6 ] we plot the predictability time ( [ eq : b3 ] ) for fixed initial error @xmath90 and different thresholds .",
    "as in the previous example , we observe an enhancement of the predictability time for large tolerance @xmath2 with respect to the lyapunov exponent estimation .",
    "for large initial errors ( as it is usually the case in numerical weather forecasting ) the predictability time is thus independent of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "we have shown that in systems with possess different characteristic time scales , the predictability time can be an independent quantity of the leading lyapunov exponent .",
    "the latter is usually associated to the faster characteristic time and dominates the exponential growth of infinitesimal errors .",
    "large errors will evolve in general with large scale characteristic time which thus rules large scale predictability .",
    "we have introduced a generalization of the lyapunov exponent which allows to compute the average exponential error growth at a given error size @xmath1 .",
    "the finite size lyapunov exponent is expected to converge at the leading lyapunov exponent for very small errors . for larger errors",
    ", @xmath6 is decreasing with @xmath1 and thus the fsle analysis predicts an enhancement of the predictability time as observed in several numerical experiments .",
    "we illustrate these concepts on two model examples which possess different characteristic timescales .",
    "the numerical computation of the fsle confirms the predictability enhancement with respect to the lyapunov analysis .",
    "our results have a general significance which exceeds the proposed models .",
    "in particular , whenever one can identify in the system different features with different intrinsic time scales , one expects that slow varying quantities ( i.e. large scale features ) are predictable longer than fast evolving quantities .",
    "moreover , our results demonstrate that the estimation of the predictability time for a large scale circulation model do not require to resolve the small scale dynamics .",
