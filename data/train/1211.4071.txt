    "be it the electromagnetic field , the curvature of a surface , or the composition of an inhomogeneous mixture , boundaries or objects interacting with a field generally place constraints on the fluctuations of it .",
    "this is known to lead to interactions between the constraining objects .",
    "the earliest and most famous example of this effect was discussed in 1948 by casimir , who showed that two charge - neutral conducting plates in vacuum attract due to the constraints they impose on the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "today it has become customary to name such interactions after casimir , even in cases where the underlying fluctuations are not quantum mechanical but thermal in origin  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we will investigate a particular incarnation of this effect , namely forces induced by thermal fluctuations between particles bound to a fluid surface characterized by surface tension  @xcite .",
    "the non - trivial aspects of such calculations tend to arise from the constraints that the extended objects impose on the partition sum .",
    "this issue is usually dealt with by pinning the field to the surface of the objects through delta - functions in the integration measure  @xcite .",
    "a clear exposition of this method , applied to compact objects in fluid membranes and films , can be found in ref .",
    "this method was later refined in the context of the electromagnetic casimir effect  @xcite . in the latter work ,",
    "the constraints of the objects enter the interaction energy through their scattering matrix coefficients .",
    "in fact , usage of scattering approaches for electromagnetic casimir interactions has a long history and has lead to some recent developments  @xcite in the field , concerning analytical results .",
    "very recently , thermal casimir interactions between biological membrane inclusions were studied in a similar spirit  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we employ a different strategy to streamline the boundary condition issue , namely , reverting to a point particle description .",
    "we emphasize right from the start that this is not an uncontrolled approximation for the shape of the extended objects , because we can systematically rescue the complete finite size information by means of effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "the key philosophy behind eft is separation of scales , which is deeply rooted in the concept of renormalization ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . originally developed in the context of quantum field theory ,",
    "it has been applied only quite recently in a purely classical framework by goldberger _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , who used it to study the gravity wave profile for inspiralling black holes . this particular incarnation of eft has subsequently been utilized to derive not only new results in gravitational wave physics   but also to calculate the leading order finite size correction to the abraham - dirac - lorentz radiation reaction force law in classical electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "both of these applications dealt with intricate boundary condition problems for classical non - fluctuating fields , whereas the present article extends the formalism to allow for finite temperatures .",
    "we recently introduced this generalization in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here we develop the formalism in greater detail , expand on our previous results , and discuss further physical situations .",
    "examples of point particle approaches employed to compute surface - mediated forces have appeared several times in the past  @xcite , in the context of biological membranes . however , in most of these references the final answer depends on the short wavelength cutoff of the continuum theory , which is ambiguous by construction . to alleviate the issue ,",
    "the cutoff is usually fixed by reinterpreting it as a multiple of the inclusion size , but there are at least two problems with this : @xmath0 the size of the objects embedded in the field and the short wavelength cutoff of the theory are generally unrelated , and @xmath1 even if the objects do have sizes of the same order as the cutoff , it is not clear how to treat particles with different radii . instead , the proper way to free physical quantities from dependence on some ambiguous cutoff is via renormalization techniques .",
    "our approach is constructed such that the cutoff never `` contaminates '' the interactions and therefore never inappropriately restricts particle sizes .",
    "another difference between earlier point - particle approaches and ours is the fact that our treatment is not approximate in that all finite size information is systematically retained in the point particle picture . unless this is done , it would not even make sense to attempt calculating higher order corrections to asymptotically correct results .    for the sake of clarity , we restrict in this paper to the case of rigid particles , _",
    "e.g. _  colloids adsorbed at a fluid - fluid interface .",
    "in other words , within the region of the surface occupied by the particle , fluctuations are not only reduced , but are _ frozen _ , in a manner compatible with the boundary conditions at the circumference of the particle and its permissible rigid body motions .",
    "furthermore , we will assume the shape of the particles are such that they have a circular footprint on the surface .",
    "while these two assumptions allow us to carry out a more transparent discussion of the eft formalism , we nonetheless outline what is entailed in relaxing these assumptions .",
    "we also briefly turn our attention to interactions that are not induced by fluctuations but by permanent shape - irregularities of the particles .",
    "the formalism allows a systematic approach to calculate these interactions without resorting to a superposition assumption to disentangle the boundary conditions of the particles from one another .    in the following section of our article ,",
    "we begin our discussion by reviewing the nature of the surface and fluctuation - induced interactions we are interested in , as well as outlining our effective field theory approach .",
    "we then proceed in section  [ sec : eft ] with constructing the effective theory and computing interactions in an asymptotic expansion .",
    "first , we illustrate the computation by considering only one of the many terms in the expansion as an example in section  [ sec : casimir ] .",
    "afterwards , we derive the interaction free energy of a pair of particles as a full expansion , _",
    "i.e. _  valid at arbitrary separation , and extract the leading near - contact behaviour .",
    "we then compute the leading non - trivial triplet and quadruplet interactions , as well as briefly discuss the case of soft or non - axisymmetric particles .",
    "finally , we show how the formalism can be used for problems where the particles impart a permanent deformation on the surface . to separate the main arguments from mundane technicalities , we have collected details of certain calculations as well as some auxiliary discussions in four appendices .",
    "we are interested in a fluid surface whose behaviour is determined by the surface tension energy @xmath2 , where the integral encompasses the entire surface and @xmath3 is the surface tension .",
    "a nearly flat surface can be parameterized using the monge gauge  @xcite , describing the shape in terms of its orthogonal deviation @xmath4 from a flat @xmath5 base plane .",
    "this yields the energy functional @xmath6 = \\sigma \\int\\limits_{\\mathcal{s } } { { \\mathrm d } } ^2r    \\sqrt { 1 + { h}_{i}^2 ( { { \\boldsymbol r } } ) } \\ , \\ ] ] where we write the gradient with the partial derivative subscript @xmath7 .",
    "note that the domain @xmath8 of the integral is not the whole @xmath9 but excludes the regions defined by the projection of the colloids onto the base plane .",
    "the presence of the particles imposes conditions on @xmath4 at the boundaries of these regions . for concreteness ,",
    "let us picture circular disks floating on the surface , which dictate the height of the fluid film anywhere along their circumference",
    ".    under the further assumption of a weakly - deformed surface , @xmath10 , one finally arrives at the quadratic surface hamiltonian @xmath6 = { \\frac{1}{2}}\\sigma \\int \\limits_{\\mathcal{s } }    { { \\mathrm d } } ^2 r \\ , { h}_i^2 ( { { \\boldsymbol r } } ) \\ , \\label{eq : h}\\ ] ] up to an irrelevant constant .",

    "this integral is a gaussian integral , on account of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) being quadratic in the field , but its evaluation is not straightforward . though one can formally write the free energy ( [ eq : pf ] ) as @xmath13 , this does not help with explicit computation , as the kernel @xmath14 ( see eqs .",

    "@xcite in that it is _ not _ necessary to assume these additional terms to be _ small _ , which corresponds to the case when the constraints on the fluctuation of the particles are not rigid .",

    "i.e. _  @xmath28 .",
    "the aim is that the effective theory reproduces the correct free energy ; that of the original system with finite sized regions of constraint , or the _ full _ theory as we will henceforth refer to it .",

    "an expansion of similar spirit was employed in ref .",

    "let us briefly discuss the temperature dependence of the free energy expansion ( [ eq : cumex ] ) .",
    "every cumulant , being the thermal average of a power of @xmath38 , will involve many - point correlators that consist of a multiplicative combination of terms in @xmath39 .",
    "recalling from eq .",
    "( [ eq : twopt ] ) that every pair of field occurrences in these many - point correlators carries a factor @xmath40 , each quadratic term in @xmath38 can be counted as a factor @xmath41 , each quartic term as @xmath42 , and so on , in the term of expansion ( [ eq : cumex ] ) they appear in . from this we see that , the traditionally encountered form @xmath43 of fluctuation - induced interactions  @xcite stems from quadratic terms in @xmath29 . this allows the interpretation of the interactions as those between _ induced _",
    "`` capillary charges , '' arising from thermal fluctuations around each particle and subsequent polarizations due to the deformation that propagates from those .",
    "similarly , one can see that higher - than - quadratic terms in @xmath29 give rise to an excess of factors of @xmath44 in the cumulants in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cumex ] ) . therefore ,",
    "such terms in the effective theory produce a free energy @xmath45 .",
    "these are higher order fluctuation corrections to the interaction .",
    "however , to treat these _ non - linear _ corrections properly , one has to also consistently relax the weak deformation assumption on the free surface hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "this involves quartic ( or higher order ) terms in the free hamiltonian that can also be treated perturbatively .",
    "while such extensions do not affect the basic eft formalism , they require additional field theoretical sophistication that would distract from the basic idea we wish to communicate here , and hence we defer such non - linear corrections to future work .",

    "it is also worth pointing out that , applying a hubbard - stratonovich transformation to the partition function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pfeff ] ) , the effective hamiltonian @xmath53 can be brought into the form of the effective action of emig _ et al . _",
    "@xcite    as we mentioned earlier , the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : drvex ] ) represent induced charges localized at the points @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the coefficients @xmath50 will be referred to as _ polarizabilities_. one can see this clearly by considering a generic term in eq .",

    "choosing @xmath54 and dropping the label @xmath33 for convenience , one substitutes @xmath55 into the term @xmath56 and observes the term linear in @xmath4 : @xmath57 one can then identify the localized source @xmath58 this source is an @xmath59 order multipole induced by the @xmath59 derivative of the background , created by thermal fluctuations or the field of another such charge .",
    "the constraints imposed on the motion of the particle ( typically by the experimental situation at hand ) determine whether a certain multipole charge can be induced or not .",
    "for instance , if the particle is free to move vertically , there will be no monopole induced , or @xmath60 , because the particle can accommodate a nonzero @xmath61 by moving up or down , without an excess energy cost .",
    "similarly , the dipole polarizability @xmath62 vanishes if there are no constraints on the tilt degree of freedom of the particle , as it can then adjust freely to a nonzero @xmath63 .",
    "we will reprise these arguments in due time when we discuss the leading order interaction between the particles .",
    "the presence of a multipole like eq .",

    "i.e. _  its energy eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) diverges logarithmically .",
    "however , this is not a property of the eft point particle description , but of the surface hamiltonian itself .",
    "therefore , calculating interactions between objects with nontrivial monopole responses in @xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _  disks with pinned height , is intrinsically an ill - defined problem and requires regularization of the surface hamiltonian  whether one is using eft or not .",
    "the issue can be alleviated by considering a finite subset of @xmath9 or modifying the theory with a damping term .",
    "however , since this would distract from the main idea we want to communicate in this article , we will defer this case to appendix  [ sec : monopole ] and avoid monopoles in the main text by restricting to particles that can fluctuate up and down freely , _",
    "i.e. _  particles for which @xmath72 .    having discussed the multipole responses , one more note for completeness is in order . although one must build @xmath29 from all scalars that the symmetries of the problem allow , terms involving repeated indices , such as @xmath73 , @xmath74 , _",

    ". one way to see this is that the response eq .",

    "the only thing we have not established yet are the exact values of the polarizability coefficients , which we will attend to in this section .",
    "these values are fixed by matching a set of observables in the effective ( point particle ) and full ( finite sized particle ) theories .",
    "although any suitably chosen set of observables will do , we will consider the most obvious one here : the polarization response to an applied field .",
    "if one is dealing with more complicated physics and boundary conditions or shapes , a different choice of observable may be more practical ( _ e.g. _  for numerical matching ) or even necessary .",
    "we gave the general expression for an @xmath59 order induced multipole response in eq .",
    "( [ eq : response ] ) . clearly , the background that will induce this response is one that is @xmath59 order in the coordinates , and the deformation decays like @xmath76 .",
    "the polarizability @xmath77 should be fixed such that this eft response is identical to the response in the full theory of the particle to the same background .",
    "given the correspondence between our present hamiltonian and classical electrostatics in 2d , the latter response is found analogously to the problem of a conductor in an external electric field .",
    "if we write the derivatives in eq .",

    "the full set of harmonic functions with square - integrable gradient has the form @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",

    "if nonlinearities are also accounted for , one may need to match more @xmath98-point functions to obtain a sufficient number of linearly independent matching conditions to fix the values of the coefficients and there may not be a simple choice of background that automatically decouples them",

    "however , this does not affect one s ability to identify features of the interaction , such as what the leading power of inverse separations in a given multi - body interaction is .",
    "if the elastic properties of the particles are ever so slightly different from the surface , then the free energy expansion acquires another smallness parameter intrinsic to the polarizabilities .",

    "again , one would expect ( and can indeed observe ) that once these deformations overlap , they give rise to aggregation of the flakes .",

    "for the sake of clarity , let us consider a pair of particles with a saddle shaped contact line deformation .",

    "its expansion at large distances reproduces our eft series , while an expansion at contact leads to eq .",
    "( [ eq : close - divergence ] ) .",
    "we again point out that computing the close distance divergence is not the most obvious application for our specific eft implementation ( which is built on a large distance expansion ) , but it nevertheless illustrates the power of the formalism quite vividly .",
    "in this appendix we will illustrate how self - energy divergences can be removed by counter - terms . while this is , to some extent , a standard textbook affair ,",
    "we include it in order to illustrate the mechanism in the presently relevant context for readers not necessarily familiar with ( quantum ) field theory .",
    "first of all , let us clarify which divergences are of interest here .",
    "purely numerical divergences , such as those of the first cumulant , get absorbed in the definition of the free surface energy ( _ i.e. _  no particles ) ; they do not refer to the relative positions of the particles and thus do not affect interaction energies .",
    "similar trivial divergences occur in every cumulant order and do not require any further discussion .",
    "the more interesting divergences are those which multiply interactions between particles and thus can not be lumped together with the free surface energy .",
    "the appearance of these divergences is due to the very construction of an effective field theory .",
    "the self - interactions necessarily involve the short distance ( high energy ) physics , through @xmath272 , where the theory is inadequate ; especially in field theories of condensed matter , we _ know _ that the continuum description breaks down below a lattice - spacing or an equivalent short length scale .",
    "but the effect of the short distance physics on large length scale ( low energy ) observables , such as the polarizabilities @xmath77 , is to renormalize ( or `` dress '' ) their values .",
    "the values we obtained for these polarizabilities , through a procedure that has nothing to do with the short distance physics of the field , are therefore renormalized values . on the other hand ,",
    "if a field theory is to make finite predictions on ( low energy ) physical observables , the renormalized couplings must be accompanied by counter - terms , or equivalently the coupling constants must be restored to their `` bare '' values . however , since the counter - terms exist for the sole purpose of canceling these ultraviolet divergences in the values for physical observables , it is legitimate not to explicitly write the counter - terms , but discard such divergences on these grounds when encountered , as we did in this article .",
    "we will nevertheless provide an example below .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", let us assume two particles possessing only a dipole polarizability described by the hamiltonian @xmath273 it is not hard to see that the divergences in the first and second cumulants , @xmath274 and @xmath275 , are of the trivial sort , _",
    "i.e. _  those that do not involve the distance between particles .",
    "however , in the third cumulant we encounter a divergent _ pair _ free energy @xmath276 as well as a similar term with the labels 1 and 2 interchanged . using the fact that @xmath277 , we may rewrite ( [ eq : divgpair ] ) as @xmath278    \\frac{c_2}{\\sigma } g_{jk}^{12 } g_{kj}^{21 } \\ , \\label{eq : divgpair2}\\ ] ] where it is apparent that this energy scales as @xmath279 .",
    "the way the factors were arranged in ( [ eq : divgpair2 ] ) makes it easy to identify what counter - term should be added to the hamiltonian to negate this unphysical divergence : one might check that the _ physical _ pair energy between these two particles at the second cumulant has exactly the form of ( [ eq : divgpair2 ] ) , except that the factor in square brackets is @xmath280 .",
    "this means that if one adds to @xmath22 the counter - term @xmath281 it produces a divergent term in the second cumulant that exactly cancels the aforementioned divergence , ( [ eq : divgpair ] ) or ( [ eq : divgpair2 ] ) , in the third cumulant . in fact , this counter - term removes all divergences caused by a single occurrence of @xmath282 in the entire cumulant expansion , but it is beyond the scope of this article to prove this .",
    "also note that adding this counter - term to the hamiltonian is equivalent to redefining the dipole polarizability @xmath283 as @xmath284    this was a simple example that exhibits an induced dipole charge that produces a divergence due to interacting with itself once . considering other multipole orders will introduce new counter - terms involving different divergences , such as @xmath285 . removing divergences due to one charge interacting with itself",
    "more than once is achieved by counter - terms of higher orders in the divergences , such as @xmath286 . regarding these counter - terms as restoring the polarizabilities to their ( divergent ) bare values @xmath287 from the renormalized @xmath77 , one may write @xmath288^n \\ , \\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath289 are pure numbers appropriately chosen to cancel the offending diagrams . in this appendix , for instance , we have explicitly found out that @xmath290 .",
    "in our treatment we avoided induced monopole terms in the effective theory , _",
    "i.e. _  terms of the form @xmath291 since the field of these charges  each proportional to @xmath292violates square integrability of its gradient in @xmath9 .",
    "such terms would describe particles with frozen vertical fluctuations .",
    "we will discuss a possible workaround for this issue .",
    "consider the regularized free surface hamiltonian @xmath293 = { \\frac{1}{2}}\\sigma \\int { { \\mathrm d } } ^2 r \\left ( { h}_i^2 +    \\lambda^{-2 } { h}^2 \\right)\\ ] ] which approaches the tension hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) in the limit of large @xmath294 .",
    "for an interface between two fluids subject to gravity ( horizontal in its unperturbed state ) , @xmath294 is the capillary length and is given by @xmath295 , where @xmath296 and @xmath297 are the gravitational acceleration and mass density difference between the fluids , respectively .",
    "the addition of the `` mass '' term damps correlations over distances larger than @xmath294 , hence regularizing the infrared divergence of monopole fields .",
    "the green function for this choice of surface energy is @xmath298 instead of @xmath299 , where @xmath300 is a modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "after this regularization , we may safely consider particles that are completely pinned .",
    "the effective theory of such particles involves the same induced charges as before , eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltah ] ) , with the addition of the monopole ( @xmath301 ) terms ( [ eq : monterms ] ) .",
    "the reader could object that , with the new choice of kernel , there may be new terms such as @xmath302 or @xmath303 , _",
    "etc_. , but these terms can be eliminated using the equation of motion , @xmath304 ( for a proof , see _",
    "e.g. _  ref .",
    "the matching of the polarizability coefficients is done similarly by comparing the response of the induced charges to backgrounds of the form @xmath305 in the full and effective theories .",
    "one finds @xmath306 and @xmath307 respectively , yielding @xmath308 expanding the bessel functions , one observes that for @xmath70 these polarizabilities converge to those in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c ] ) as @xmath309 , whereas the massless limit of the monopole polarizability is @xmath310 where @xmath311 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "we observe that the monopole polarizability vanishes like @xmath312 in the massless limit of infinite capillary length that we eventually want to take .",
    "this means diagrams involving monopoles could vanish as well , unless every factor of @xmath313 due to a monopole polarizability is canceled by a similar factor in the numerator .",
    "factors of this form indeed exist : they come from monopole - monopole links in the propagator product , since in the massless limit @xmath314 . due to the closed topology of the diagrams ,",
    "there are enough monopole - monopole links to balance the vanishing monopole polarizabilities _ only _ when there are no higher order multipoles in the diagram ; replacing one monopole polarizability in the diagram costs two monopole - monopole links .",
    "in other words , the only monopole interactions that do not vanish in the massless limit are those with other induced monopoles and nothing else .",
    "this elucidates and generalizes the findings of lehle and oettel that monopole - dipole and monopole - quadrupole interactions indeed vanish  @xcite .",
    "we can now write the pair interaction between two pinned particles , on a capillary surface for which the capillary length tends to infinity . the interaction will consist of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullasym ] ) due to induced multipoles of order @xmath70 and , based on the discussion of the previous paragraph , a part @xmath315 that is due solely to monopole polarizabilities .",
    "observe that in the latter , propagators do not carry any derivatives and therefore _ all _ the cumulants are of the same order in the inter - particle separation .",
    "hence , all cumulants must be summed for the monopole interactions . to evaluate this",
    ", one can refer to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pairdiags ] ) , keeping in mind that there is no sum over multipole orders @xmath316 now ; only the monopoles are taken .",

    "the second term is proportional to @xmath323 , which is associated with a force @xmath324 as @xmath309 .",
