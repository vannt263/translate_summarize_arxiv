    "the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) 4u  174637 shows type i x - ray bursts ( li & clark 1977 ) and dips ( parmar et al .",
    "1989 ) which recur on the 5.7 hours ( sansom et al .",
    "1993 ) orbital period .",
    "the source is located in the globular cluster ngc  6441 .",
    "deutsch et al . ( 1998 ) reported the probable detection of the optical counterpart .",
    "the dips in dip sources such as 4u  174637 are thought to be caused by periodic obscuration of the central source by a structure formed in an interplay between the accretion stream from the companion towards the disk and the disk itself ( white & swank 1982 ; white , nagase , & parmar 1995 ; frank , king , & lasota 1987 ) .",
    "this structure moves through the line of sight fully or partially obscuring the central source once per binary cycle .",
    "often , the x - ray spectral properties change during the dips .",
    "spectral hardening occurs in 4u  132362 ( parmar et al .",
    "1989 ) , and spectral softening in deep dips seen in 4u  162449 ( church & baluciska - church 1995 ) . in 4u  174637",
    "no energy dependence was found so far ( sansom et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the type i x - ray bursts are observed to have peak luminosities around the eddington luminosity for the estimated distance to the globular cluster ( 10.7 kpc ; djorgovski 1993 ) .",
    "combined with the fact that the ratio of the x - ray to optical luminosities @xmath1 , this makes it likely that outside the dips the central source is viewed directly ( parmar et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "recently , in two dipping lmxbs , 4u  132362 ( jonker et al .",
    "1999a ) and exo  0748676 ( homan et al .",
    "1999 ) , quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) with a typical frequency of 1 hz were discovered . in exo",
    "0748676 these frequencies vary between 0.582.44 hz on timescales ranging from several days to weeks ( homan et al .",
    "observations with intervals of several days to weeks revealed similar frequency shifts in 4u  132362 ( jonker et al .",
    "these qpos are strong , with fractional rms amplitudes of @xmath010% , which are the same in the persistent emission , during dips , and during type i x - ray bursts .",
    "the rms amplitude of the qpos does not , or only weakly , depend on the photon energy , unlike that of various other types of qpo observed from lmxbs ( van der klis 1995 , 1998 ) . from these properties , and",
    "the fact that the @xmath01 hz qpos are observed in high inclination systems , jonker et al .",
    "( 1999a ) suggested that partial obscuration of the central source by a near - opaque or gray medium in or on the disk covering and uncovering the source quasi - periodically at the observed qpo frequency could explain the qpo properties .",
    "the most natural location for such a medium would be at the radius where the orbital frequency in the disk is equal to the qpo frequency , which corresponds to a radius of @xmath2  x  @xmath3 cm for a 1.4@xmath4 neutron star ( jonker et al .",
    "1999a ) .",
    "on the basis of the timing and spectral properties of lmxbs hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) defined the atoll and the z sources .",
    "the atoll sources show at least two states , named after the associated structures in the x - ray color - color diagram ( cd ) : the island and the banana branch . the timing and spectral properties of the sources in these states are different . in the island state strong band limited noise",
    "is present in the power spectra .",
    "when the source moves up the banana branch the fractional rms amplitude of this noise component decreases and simultaneously the rms amplitude of a very low frequency power law noise ( vlfn ) component increases .",
    "the z sources have higher luminosities and trace out a z track in the cd .",
    "the timing properties are correlated with the position along this track ( for a complete overview of the timing and spectral properties of the atoll and z sources , see van der klis 1995 ) .    in this letter , we report the discovery of a @xmath01 hz qpo in the source 4u  174637 . we also show that the spectral characteristics and some of the timing properties of this source are reminiscent of those of an atoll source .",
    "we analysed 9 observations of 4u  174637 obtained with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the _ rxte _ satellite ( bradt , rothschild , & swank 1993 ) , in 1996 on october 25 , 27 , 31 , and in 1998 on june 5 , june 6 , august 3 ,",
    "november 7 , and november 22 .",
    "the total amount of good data analysed was @xmath0129 ksec .",
    "a log of the observations can be found in table  [ obs_log ] .",

    "we observed shallow dips in the lightcurve showing a decrease in count rate of only @xmath015% , and one deep dip with evidence for spectral hardening ( see fig .",
    "[ dip ] , and section 3 ) . during the last part of observation 9 a solar flare occured ; we excluded these data from our analysis .    since the dips were often difficult to distinguish from the persistent emission ( sansom et al .",
    "1993 ; parmar et al .",
    "1999 ) , we divided the data into just two categories ; non - burst ( which combines persistent emission and dip data ) and burst data",
    ".    for the selection of the burst data the start of a burst was characterized by the sharp increase in flux and simultaneous decrease in hardness . the burst e - folding time was determined by fitting an exponential to the burst decay in the 260 kev lightcurve of the standard 1 data .",
    "the end of the burst was chosen to be three times the e - folding time after the onset ( see also jonker et al .",
    "1999a ) .    using the good xenon data , we calculated power spectra of non - burst data segments of 64  s length and of burst data segments of 16  s length in the energy bands 260 kev , 26.4 kev , and 6.460 kev , with a nyquist frequency of 512 hz . we also calculated power spectra of segments of 16  s length with a nyquist frequency of 2048 hz in the 260 kev band .",
    "the power spectra within each energy band were added and averaged for each observation , separately for burst and non - burst data . to search for burst oscillations we also calculated power spectra of a length of 1  s with a nyquist frequency of 2048 hz .",
    "we constructed a cd from all non - burst standard 2 data , using four detectors ( 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .",
    "the hard color in this diagram is defined as the logarithm of the ratio between the count rates in the 9.716.0 kev band and the count rates in the 6.09.7 kev band , and the soft color as the logarithm of the ratio between the count rates in the 3.56.0 kev band and the count rates in the 23.5 kev band",
    "in the non - burst data of october 25 1996 ( observation 1 ) , we discovered a qpo in the 260 kev band with a frequency , fwhm , and rms amplitude of @xmath6 hz , @xmath7 hz , and 7.7%@xmath80.7% ( 6@xmath9 ) , respectively ( see fig .  [ qpo ] ) . in the observations of october 27 ( observation 2 ) and october 31 ( observation 3 ) 1996 , we observed qpos with similar frequencies , fwhms and rms amplitudes , albeit at a lower significance level ( see table  [ sig_det ] ) .",

    "upper limits on the presence of the qpo were derived fixing the values of the fwhm and frequency obtained in the 260 kev energy band , except for observation 2 . for this observation we used the values obtained in the 26.4 kev band , since the qpo was not detected at a significance higher than @xmath22 in the 260 kev band ( see table  [ sig_det ] ) . only for observation 1",
    "the qpo was detected at a significance higher than 3@xmath9 in both the 26.4 kev and the 6.420 kev energy band . within the errors",
    "the rms amplitude of the qpo in the two energy bands was the same ( see table  [ sig_det ] ) .",
    "the qpo was also detected when all 16  s segment power spectra ( 9 in total ) of the decay of the three bursts of observation 1 were combined , at a similar fractional rms amplitude ( 7.2%@xmath23% ) .",
    "the averaged count rate was @xmath0720 counts per second , i.e. , about ten times that in the persistent emission .",

    "its rms amplitude integrated over 0.01561 hz varied from 7.1%@xmath25% to 5.9%@xmath26% and to 9.3%@xmath26% , from observation 13 , while the power law index was consistent with being constant at @xmath27 . in the observations 49 ,",
    "the noise amplitude was in the range of 1.6%5.7% . here",
    ", the fractional rms amplitude increased with increasing intensities ( see table  [ obs_log ] ) , except for observation 8 were it was only 1.6% .",
    "the power law indices ranged from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "the rms amplitude of this power law component is slightly higher in the 6.420 than in the 26.4 kev band .",
    "the 6.420/26.4 kev spectral hardness did not significantly depend on the presence or absence of the qpo .    combining all non - burst data into a cd",
    ", we observed a pattern which resembles the atoll shape ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) , ( fig .  [ cd ] ) .",
    "two distinct parts can be distinguished in the cd , a hard ( low intensity , upper part of the diagram ) island - like state , and a softer ( higher intensity , lower part of the diagram ) banana branch .",
    "the @xmath01 hz oscillations were only found when the source was in the upper ( hard ) part of the diagram ( made up of observations 13 ) .",
    "upper limits on the presence of a qpo in the range of 0.52.5 hz of 1%2% were derived for the banana part of the diagram ( made up of observations 49 ) .",
    "we observed a total of 12 type i bursts .",
    "one burst in the second observation and two bursts in the third observation showed secondary bursts , occurring several hunderd seconds after the first burst and with a 34 times lower peak flux ( see lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1995 ) .",
    "the burst e - folding times ranged from 7.5 to 11.3 seconds for bursts observed in observations 13 , and from 7.5 to 14.5 for the secondary bursts .",
    "the burst e - folding time of 4 of the 5 bursts observed in observation 8 and 9 ranged from 27.730.1 seconds , while one burst in observation 9 which occured @xmath0600 seconds after a burst with a 2.3 higher peak flux had an e - folding time of only 3.0 seconds ( the peak flux of this very short burst was similar to that of the bursts in the low intensity state ) .",
    "upper limits on burst oscillations in the 1001000 hz frequency range during the peak and decay of the bursts adding the different bursts of typically @xmath015% were derived .",
    "one of the dips observed in observation 7 was different from the others ; it showed a simultaneous sharp increase in hard color of @xmath028% , and drop in count rate from @xmath0200 counts per second to @xmath021 counts per second .",
    "the dip was quite short ( @xmath0250 s ) , whereas previous dips were shallow ( @xmath015% ) , and exhibited no clear spectral hardening ( see fig .",
    "[ dip ] ) . due to the uncertainties in the orbital ephemeris",
    ", we could not relate the exact time of this deep dip to the dips in the other observations .",
    "upper limits on the presence of khz qpos in the frequency range of 1001000 hz were derived using a fixed fwhm of 50 hz .",
    "the upper limits were in the range of 3.4%6.5% .",
    "we discovered a qpo in 4u  174637 with a frequency of @xmath01 hz , and an rms amplitude of @xmath07.5% .",
    "the qpo was also observed during type i x - ray bursts where the count rate was a factor of 10 higher , with similar fractional rms amplitudes .",
    "the qpo in 4u  174637 was only observed when the source intensity was low .",
    "the frequency of the qpo , the weak energy dependence of its rms amplitude , and the ratio q between the qpo frequency and its fwhm are similar to the frequencies , the rms amplitude energy dependence , and q - values ( 34 ) of the qpos discovered recently in the persistent emission , dips , and during the type i x - ray bursts in the dippers and lmxbs 4u  132362 ( jonker et al . 1999a ) and in exo  0748676 at low intensity ( homan et al .",
    "the similarities in qpo properties and the fact that 4u  174637 is a dipper suggest that the @xmath01 hz qpo is a general property of high - inclination lmxbs at low intensities , and has a common origin in these systems .",
    "we found for the first time that 4u  174637 showed spectral characteristics of an atoll source ; the timing properties of observations 49 were consistent with banana branch behavior reported for atoll sources ( van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "although no band limited noise was detected , upper limits ( 1512 hz ) in the low intensity ( hard ) state were 20%28% , whereas they were 2.5%5.5% when the source was on the apparent banana branch .",
    "so , with respect to the band limited noise the timing behavior of the source is consistent with that of an atoll source .",
    "also the fact that on the banana branch the rms amplitude of the power law noise component increased as the source moved up in count rate is consistent with the behavior of the vlfn on the banana branch of an atoll source .",
    "however , the high ( 5.9%7.1% ) rms amplitude and low power law index ( 0.5 ) of the power law noise component when the source is at low intensities is not consistent with island - state vlfn .",
    "we note that this could be due to effects observable only at high inclinations , similar to those which cause the dips and the @xmath01 hz qpo . in exo  0748676 strong power law noise ( 6%11% ) with indices",
    "0.50.8 was also present .",
    "this noise had no or weak dependence on photon energy , just as the @xmath01 hz qpos ( homan et al . 1999 ) , suggesting a similar origin for both phenomena .",
    "in the one observation of exo  0748676 where no qpo was found the rms amplitude of the vlfn was lower ( @xmath04% ) and the power law index was @xmath01 .",
    "the spectral changes we report in 4u  174637 related to changes in the position along the atoll , probably reflect the changing spectral characteristics reported before for this source ( eg . see parmar et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "homan et al . ( 1999 ) found that the qpo in exo  0748676 was present in all observations except one , where the persistent emission count rate was @xmath02.5 times higher than in the other observations .",
    "the fact that the qpo is not detected at higher source count rates ( and inferred mass accretion rates ) may be due to changes in the accretion geometry with @xmath30 .",
    "we expect that if we observe 4u  132362 at higher @xmath30 , the qpo may disappear as well . in 4u  174637",
    "the qpo also disappeared when the count rate increased .",
    "the rms amplitude dropped by at least a factor of five when the source moved from the low intensity state to the banana branch .",
    "this can be accounted for if the size of the central source increased by a factor of 23 in radius , decreasing the modulated fraction of the x - rays below our treshold of 1%2% .",
    "if this is the explanation the dip fraction should decrease , making the dips more shallow . since in 4u  174637",
    "the dips were shallow and the source count rates were low , we were not able to check this prediction for this source .",
    "another possibility is that the structure in or on the disk responsible for the @xmath01 hz qpo disappeared or decreased in size , or the optical depth of the gray medium changed .",
    "we found that the burst e - folding time is shorter ( @xmath010  s ) when the source is in the low intensity state than when the source is on the higher intensity banana branch ( @xmath030  s ) .",
    "this is opposite to what was found by van paradijs , penninx , & lewin ( 1988 ) for several sources .",
    "van der klis et al .",
    "( 1990 ) found for 4u  163653 that the burst duration was longer ( @xmath31  s ) when the source was in the island part of the cd than when the source was in the banana branch ( @xmath32  s ) .",
    "either the state where we observed the short burst e - folding times is not the product of an island state and high inclination effects as we propose , but a state at a higher mass accretion rate than the banana branch mass accretion rate , or another parameter rather than @xmath30 is also affecting the burst duration .",
    "the frequency of the qpo was 0.35 hz higher during the type i x - ray bursts than during the persistent emission of observation 1 .",
    "similar increases in the qpo frequency during bursts were also observed in exo  0748676 by homan et al .",
