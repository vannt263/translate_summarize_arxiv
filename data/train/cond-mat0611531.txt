    "there are currently many highly - frustrated magnetic materials being experimentally studied where the magnetic species consist of a rare - earth 4f ion , such as ho@xmath5 , dy@xmath5 , gd@xmath5 or tb@xmath5 , which can have a large magnetic dipole moment .",
    "because of the large moment , the long - range dipole - dipole interactions in these systems are an important part of the full spin hamiltonian .",
    "the role of dipolar interactions in highly frustrated magnetic ising systems has been systematically investigated for the three - dimensional pyrochlore lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedra @xcite .    in highly - frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnets of corner - sharing triangles or tetrahedra , any state with zero total magnetic moment on each elementary triangle or tetrahedron unit",
    "is a classical ground state @xcite .",
    "there are an infinite number of such spin configurations and this is why these systems fail to develop conventional magnetic order at nonzero temperature @xcite . in cases where dipolar interactions are somewhat weaker than nearest - neighbor exchange interactions , one might have naively assumed that the long - range dipolar interactions can be truncated at a finite cut - off distance , @xmath0 , since the nearest - neighbor exchange energetically controls and enforces the nearest - neighbor correlations .",
    "previous studies on the ising spin ice pyrochlore systems  @xcite and the heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet  @xcite have found that this naive expectation is erroneous and that truncating the dipolar interactions at a finite cut - off distance @xmath0 leads to spurious ( unphysical ) long - range ordered phases , and that it is crucial to consider dipolar interactions to infinite distance ( @xmath6 ) . in this paper",
    "we report a third example of a highly frustrated spin system which is very sensitive to the dipolar cut - off .",
    "specifically , we consider a heisenberg model on the three - dimensional garnet lattice structure of corner - shared triangles .",
    "our work extends the study of a dipolar ising version of the model on a garnet lattice  @xcite and is relevant to the ultimate understanding of the nature of the incommensurate spin - spin correlations that develop in the gd@xmath1ga@xmath2o@xmath3 garnet ( ggg ) antiferromagnet below a temperature of 500  mk  @xcite .",
    "in order to investigate the problem of an adequate treatment of the dipolar interactions in ggg , we consider below a minimal model hamiltonian @xmath7 for it .",
    "to best expose the physics of a truncated dipolar lattice sum , we ignore the effects of the quantum nature of the gd@xmath5 spins , lattice disorder @xcite , exchange interactions beyond nearest neighbors @xcite and possible single ion anisotropy  @xcite , all of which are potentially important for a thorough quantitative understanding of ggg . we describe the magnetic @xmath8 spins @xmath9 as classical and isotropic @xmath10 component ( heisenberg ) vectors of the length @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) coupled by frustrated antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor exchange and long range dipolar interactions , of strength @xmath13 k and @xmath14 k , respectively @xcite : @xmath15 .",

    "second , though the general topology of @xmath40 within the brillouin zone is preserved with varying dipolar cut - off distance @xmath0 , its fine structure is manifestly sensitive to @xmath0 .",
    "the ordering wave vector @xmath4 displays a non - monotonous dependence upon @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ hhlrc.eps ] by its movement throughout the zone .",
    "third , @xmath4 converges to a well - defined value , and so does the dispersion of @xmath40 away from @xmath4 , at large values of @xmath0 , as is evident by comparing the @xmath47 panel with the limiting case of @xmath6 , recast by the ewald method @xcite .",
    "these are the central results of the paper .",
    "( 450,330 ) ( 5,320 ) ( 215,320 ) ( 5,160 ) ( 215,160 )    we now proceed to calculate the neutron scattering intensity @xmath22 of model ( [ ham ] ) within the mft scheme , eq .",
    "( [ iqmft ] ) .",
    "unlike the spectra @xmath30 , @xmath22 can be directly compared to experiments , such as the one on a powder sample of ggg in zero external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we determine the powder intensity @xmath48 by numerically calculating the spherical average of @xmath22 , which entails the application of a cubic interpolation procedure separately to the numerator and denominator of eq .",

    "[ fc.eps ] the mft powder scattering profiles @xmath48 of model ( [ ham ] ) at several @xmath49 .",

    "[ fc.eps ] ) . at temperatures",
    "sufficiently far from the mean - field critical regime ( fig .",
    "[ fc.eps ] , @xmath51 ) , the magnetic correlations are not very sensitive to @xmath0 . in fact , it has been found in monte carlo simulations  @xcite , that paramagnetic liquid - like correlations of ggg can be well described by completely ignoring the dipolar term . at @xmath52",
    "the profiles start to capture the effect of the dipolar interactions on the magnetic correlations .",
    "the effect turns out to depend on @xmath0 . indeed , at @xmath53 as opposed to the @xmath54 growth of the @xmath28-dependent intensities .",
    "this explains the necessity of considering rather small @xmath50 in order to theoretically approach the critical regime . ]",
    "the profiles clearly display a specific @xmath55dependence sensitive to the chosen @xmath0 .",
    "starting from this regime , the influence of small @xmath0 becomes uncontrollable , as seen by the formation of bragg peaks at spurious ordering wave vectors ( cf .",
    "[ hhlrc.eps ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fc.eps ] shows that even the consideration of a rather large dipolar cut - off of @xmath56 does not allow one to reproduce magnetic correlations consistent with the physical @xmath6 limit .",
    "this , together with the incommensurability of the fundamental ordering wave vector of the physical @xmath6 case : @xmath57 strongly warns against using a standard monte carlo method with periodic boundary conditions to tackle this problem .",
    "moreover , we anticipate that a @xmath58 finite - size correction of the real space representation of the ewald interactions would be sufficiently large for numerically accessible system sizes so as to prohibit a quantitative disentanglement of the role of perturbative terms  @xcite to model ( [ ham ] ) , presumably a necessary condition for obtaining a quantitative description of the experimental incommensurate magnetic correlations  @xcite in ggg .",
    "to conclude , we have identified another example of a highly frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnetic system , namely that on the garnet lattice , where the selection of the soft mode is sensitive to an ad - hoc cut - off distance @xmath0 of the dipolar interactions .",
    "this adds to the cases of the ising ( spin ice )  @xcite and the dipolar heisenberg antiferromagnets  @xcite , both on the pyrochlore lattice",
    ". continued progress in understanding ggg may be possible provided the dipolar interactions are treated at their physical infinite cut - off limit @xmath6 .",
    "this will , however , require systematic investigations of the roles of long - range exchange @xcite and single ion anisotropy  @xcite in this material . finally , we note that the positions and relative intensity of the @xmath48 maxima differ dramatically from those found experimentally ( fig .",
    "2a of ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; an adjustment of @xmath50 does not solve the discrepancy .",
    "this may indicate that a quantitative description of the low - temperature spin - spin correlations in ggg requires inclusion of exchange interactions beyond nearest neighbours @xcite and/or single ion anisotropy .",
