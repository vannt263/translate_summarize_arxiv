    "computer simulations of complex systems have had spectacular success in modern science due to sophisticated classical approximation methods and steadily increasing computational power .",
    "however , it is ultimately impractical to accurately simulate the dynamics of even moderately - sized quantum systems due to their exponentially - increasing parameter space . quantum simulation , as first proposed by feynman @xcite , offers a path forward whereby the simulator itself operates via quantum instead of classical dynamics .",
    "there are two possible approaches to modeling a quantum system .",
    "the first is _ simulation _ , in which a digital model of a system s hamiltonian yields a physical quantity .",
    "an example is provided by recent quantum chemistry simulations of a hydrogen molecule  @xcite on a small - scale quantum computer .",
    "the second is _ emulation _ , which involves the modeling of a quantum system with a better - controllable system which is governed by a sufficiently similar hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "quantum walks ",
    "natural extensions of the ubiquitous classical random walk into the quantum world  @xcite  provide an ideal framework for emulation due to their rich dynamics  @xcite .",
    "there are two limiting cases , discrete and continuous . in discrete - time",
    "quantum walks , one or more ( interacting ) quantum particles ( the so - called quantum coin ) evolve on a graph , with their evolution governed by their internal quantum ( coin ) states .",
    "the discrete - time quantum walk on a line is the best studied example of such a walk and it has been demonstrated in a number of physical systems @xcite .    in continuous - time quantum walks , in contrast , there are no coin operations , the evolution is defined entirely in position space @xcite . these walks",
    "require a well - controlled , continuous coupling between vertices , or lattice sites .",
    "ideally , this coupling should be stable and robust against decoherence .",
    "integrated optics is perfectly suited for this task .",
    "lithographically written , evanescently coupled surface waveguides have already been used to study continuous time quantum walks on a line @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of surface waveguides is that they can only realise simple , one - dimensional graphs with limited interconnectivity .",
    "physically more interesting three - dimensional structures can be engineered in laser - written optical waveguide arrays in dielectric materials such as fused silica  @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional graphs that can be realised with this technique allow the study of new quantum walk phenomena , such as wave communication @xcite , cooperative quantum games @xcite and the creation of topological phases in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "examples of waveguide array structures which have been manufactured with this technique include rings , regular and hexagonal lattices , x - shapes and triangular shapes @xcite . to date , however ,",
    "these have only been explored with coherent light .",
    "true quantum effects , and associated genuine improvements in efficiency of emulating quantum systems will only emerge for non - classical input states @xcite , such as recently demonstrated experimentally for a one - dimensional waveguide lattice in @xcite .    here , we study multi - walker continuous - time quantum walks in an optical chip containing an elliptical arrangement of coupled direct - write waveguides .",
    "we characterise the optical chip via coherent light tomography , effectively realising single particle walks and use the results to predict correlations in non - classical two - photon walks which we compare with experimental observations .",
    "our work is an important step towards the emulation of quantum systems in three - dimensional integrated photonic architectures .",
    "relative to the interaction region along the beam direction . at the input the waveguides",
    "are equally spaced at 127@xmath0 .",
    "they then converge via a two - stage fan - in to their eventual elliptical configuration , which is shown in the ccd camera picture in the inset : the waveguides are arranged with equal angular spacing around an ellipse with semi - major and semi - minor radii of 10.2 and 7.0  @xmath1 m respectively . ]",
    "the circuit for the continuous time quantum walk , shown in figure  [ fig : circuit ] , consists of six waveguides written into a chip of high - purity fused silica using an ultrafast direct - write technique  @xcite . in this technique , femtosecond ti : sapphire laser pulses tightly focused inside the sample yield localized refractive index modifications . by translating the sample in three dimensions these index modifications",
    "can manifest as waveguides tracing three - dimensional curves , a process that can not be replicated in conventional lithographic waveguide fabrication techniques .",
    "our chip was written with a 1  khz repetition rate , 800  nm , 120  fs laser , passed through a 520  @xmath1 m slit and focused with a 40x 0.6 na microscope objective .    at the circuit input ,",
    "the six waveguides are arranged along a line with an equal spacing of 127 @xmath1 m .",
    "this allows each waveguide to be addressed individually and simultaneously .",
    "the waveguides then converge via a two - stage fan - in to their final configuration as shown in figure  [ fig : circuit ] . in the primary fan - in stage , which occupies the first 8.5  mm of the chip ,",
    "the waveguides follow s - bend curves from their linear input arrangement to an elliptical configuration twice as large in radius as their final configuration . in the second fan - in stage , comprising the next 1  mm , further s - bends shrink this array to its final geometry of an ellipse with a semi - major axis of 10.2  @xmath1 m and semi - minor axis of 7.0  @xmath1 m .",
    "all the s - bends are of the ` raised - sine ' form which has been shown to minimise bend loss @xcite , while the two - stage fan - in configuration was designed to minimise coupling ( in particular , _ asymmetrical _ coupling ) between non - adjacent waveguides before they reach their final configuration",
    ".    the light evolution in such a waveguide array is governed by the evanescent inter - waveguide coupling which drops off exponentially as a function of the waveguide distance .",
    "it is theoretically described by a coupled - oscillator hamiltonian , which is described in the appendix .",
    "nm laser diode , imaged onto a ccd camera via a polarising prism .",
    "( b ) quantum walks were performed with two - photon inputs created via spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) .",
    "the relative delay @xmath2 between the two input photons was adjusted using a translation stage .",
    "we used a 50/50 beamsplitter ( bs ) and two @xmath3 m apertures to select a combination of output ports and measure the two - photon correlations in coincidence using single - photon avalanche diodes . ]",
    "the experimental setup is shown in figure  [ fig : tpwalk ] .",
    "light was coupled into the chip via a v - groove array , which houses six single - mode input fibres on a line , matching the input spacing of the circuit waveguides .",
    "we first illuminated individual waveguides in the chip using coherent light from an @xmath4  nm laser diode , see figure  [ fig : tpwalk]a ) .",
    "the output intensity profiles were processed in matlab and converted into probability distributions . when compared to the numerical simulation obtained with the software suite which was used to design the chip , the predicted distribution at the circuit output was starkly different to the observed distribution as shown in figure  [ fig : propdists ] .",
    "this behaviour prompted us to empirically determine the full optical response of the circuit using six - port , polarisation - sensitive coherent light tomography .    for this tomography",
    "the input polarisation was set using a bare reference fibre on top of the chip . into each waveguide",
    "we input the following set of polarisation states : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent horizontal and vertical polarisation and @xmath8 , @xmath9 . for each output we measured the same six polarisation components ,",
    "obtaining a total of @xmath10 ccd images .    using output intensity distributions taken from these images , we subsequently reconstructed an array of 36 mueller matrices @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "this array completely characterises the optical response of the circuit , quantifying the effects of three distinct processes : notably polarisation - dependent inter - waveguide coupling , birefringence , and polarisation - dependent loss  @xcite .    .",
    "( a ) the propagation dynamics predicted using optical waveguide simulation software ( see appendix ) with light input into waveguide @xmath12 , as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "the simulation includes modelling of inter - waveguide coupling during the @xmath12  mm second fan - in stage at @xmath14 .",
    "the curves for waveguides 2 and 4 , and 3 and 5 overlap due to symmetry .",
    "( b ) the predicted distribution at the output of the circuit , and the corresponding observed probabilities .",
    "the distinct differences in the two distributions indicate that the optical response of the chip is not scalar , instead suggesting significant vectorial behaviour .",
    "this was confirmed by further tomographic analysis . ]",
    "( see appendix ) describing the transformation from input waveguide @xmath15 to outputs @xmath16 .",
    "input states shown on the outer poincar spheres are mapped to different locations on the blue ellipsoids , simultaneously showing polarisation - dependent coupling and birefringent effects in the respective channel .",
    "the relative orientation of the ellipsoids is indicated by the set of orthogonal states @xmath6 ( red arrow ) , @xmath17 ( green arrow ) and @xmath18 ( black arrow ) , and the point of contact between sphere and ellipsoid is indicated by the yellow arrow .",
    "note that the arrow lengths are proportional to output power , _ not _ degree of polarisation .",
    "the numbers above each sphere give the normalised average power coupled into the respective channel . ]",
    "the results indicate strong birefringence in each of the six waveguides .",
    "most notably , when the state @xmath6 is input into waveguide @xmath19 , @xmath20% of the overall output state across the six channels is rotated to @xmath7 . for the input channels",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the overall polarisation rotation was small , with more than @xmath23 of @xmath6 being retained in each case .",
    "furthermore , there was significant polarisation - dependent coupling between the waveguides for all input channels .",
    "for instance , for input @xmath6 into waveguide @xmath12 , @xmath24% of the total output intensity was observed in channel @xmath15 , however when the input state was @xmath7 , only @xmath25% of the total output intensity was contained in this channel .",
    "an exemplary selection of mueller matrices , illustrated on poincar spheres and quantifying these effects is shown in figure  [ fig : ellipsoids ] .",
    "the full matrix array @xmath11 can be found in the appendix .",
    "in addition , the whole chip exhibited significant polarisation dependent loss ; integrating over all output channels , we observed an excess @xmath26 loss of @xmath7 compared to @xmath6 for waveguide @xmath15 .",
    "this may be due to a combination of absorption into the bulk of the circuit , or polarisation dependence of the input coupling efficiency from the v - groove array to the chip , or both .",
    "the coherent - light tomography encompasses all possible single - photon walks in this chip , since a single photon shares the coherence properties of a coherent light beam .",
    "however , these walks can be efficiently simulated classically and it is not until we input multi - photon states that we observe quantum effects @xcite .",
    "a schematic of the setup for the two - photon walk experiment is shown in figure  [ fig : tpwalk]b ) .",
    "pairs of single photons are created via spontaneous parametric down - conversion : a mode - locked @xmath27  mhz laser centred at @xmath4  nm is frequency doubled to @xmath28  nm and focused into a @xmath21  mm long @xmath29-barium borate ( bbo ) crystal , phase - matched for type - i downconversion . after passing through interference filters at @xmath30  nm , the degenerate output photon pairs",
    "are coupled into single - mode fibres equipped with manual polarisation controllers .",
    "they are then connected to the v - groove fibre array and thence to the chip .",
    "we created photon pairs at a measured rate of @xmath31  khz , of which we detected a total of @xmath32  khz at the circuit output .",
    "the main loss contributions stemmed from the poor input coupling efficiency between the v - groove array and the chip @xmath33 , and the 50/50 beamsplitter @xmath34 at the output .",
    "the imperfect coupling is mostly due to a slight mismatch between the spacing of the fibres in the v - groove array and the locations of the input ports of the circuit .",
    "the observed loss could be significantly reduced by using a more sophisticated imaging system .     and @xmath21 .",
    "the visibility of the dip is @xmath35 , calculated from a gaussian fit ( blue line ) . ]     and",
    "we recorded the photon - coincidence counts at each of the @xmath36 pairs of output channels in a @xmath37 second time - window .",
    "( a ) the measured and ( b ) predicted correlation matrices for ( left ) temporally distinguishable photon pairs @xmath38 , ( center ) temporally indistinguishable simultaneous walkers @xmath39 , and ( right ) the difference @xmath40 .",
    "the coincidence probability at the outputs @xmath21 and @xmath15 between the two plots reflects the two - photon interference dip shown in figure [ fig : hom12in26out ] .",
    "the measured uncertainties are not plotted , as they are too small to be seen on the plots . ]",
    "we carried out two - photon quantum walks in two separate scenarios : with temporally distinguishable and indistinguishable photons . when the photons entering the chip are temporally distinguishable , i.e. with a time delay larger than their respective coherence times , they perform independent quantum walks with local evolution .",
    "when they enter the chip simultaneously , @xmath41 , they experience non - classical two - photon interference  @xcite , which can yield quantum dynamics , including generation of two - photon entanglement .",
    "the theoretic qualitative difference between these two cases is described in the appendix .",
    "figure  [ fig : hom12in26out ] shows an exemplary calibration scan of coincidence counts as a function of time delay .",
    "the signature of indistinguishable quantum walkers manifests as a dip in the rate of coincident detection events , @xmath42 , at zero delay , with an interference visibility of @xmath43 of @xmath44 .     and @xmath22 .",
    "the plots follow the same convention as those in figure  [ fig : corr12total ] , for both ( a ) the measured and ( b ) predicted correlation matrices .",
    "uncertainties are again too small to be seen on the graphs . ]",
    "the results for two - photon quantum walks for distinguishable and indistinguishable photons input into the _ nearest_-neighbour channels @xmath12 and @xmath21 are shown in figure  [ fig : corr12total]a ) , as the normalised coincidence probability distributions , @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "distinct differences are observed between the two cases , as suggested by the strong two - photon interference signature in figure  [ fig : hom12in26out ] .",
    "the measured distributions are compared with predictions , figure  [ fig : corr12total]b ) , which are based on determining the components of the waveguide array unitary @xmath45 , for a particular input polarisation , see appendix for details .",
    "the generalised overlap fidelities @xmath46 , defined in the appendix , between our measurements and predictions are @xmath47 for the distinguishable walkers , and @xmath48 for the indistinguishable walkers .",
    "figure  [ fig : corr24total]a ) shows correlation matrices for inputs @xmath21 and @xmath22 as an example of two - photon walks with _",
    "next_-nearest neighbour input ports .",
    "we again observe non - classical interference signatures , with visibilities up to @xmath49 .",
    "the fidelities between the measured two - photon matrices and their corresponding predictions , figure  [ fig : corr24total]b ) , are @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed the first quantum walk on a general two - dimensional waveguide structure with genuine non - classical inputs .",
    "this is a significant step towards emulating hamiltonians which can be approximated with evanescently coupled waveguides .",
    "however , we have also identified a number of obstacles which must be addressed before such an approach can be fully realised .    first , despite the apparent good agreement between our predictions and the observed two - photon probability distributions , the two - photon visibilities  which quantify the measured non - classical effects  matched the predictions poorly .",
    "this is because the mueller - matrix array derived from the coherent beam intensities only yields the squared absolute values of the elements of the system s unitary @xmath45 ; it does not determine the ( generally complex ) phase relations of the waveguide array .",
    "these phase factors could in principle be obtained by phase - sensitive coherent light tomography , as proposed in  @xcite .",
    "an alternative technique  @xcite requires a single @xmath52-photon input state ( in this case @xmath53 ) and photon - number resolved detection at each output .",
    "however , generating large @xmath52 number states is technically difficult , and both techniques suffer from the large number of measurements required to fully characterise the six - port system .",
    "this is a perennial problem in quantum science : the exponential power granted by multi - photon walks on big lattices makes it hard to experimentally characterise system dynamics .",
    "a potential solution might be to use compressive sensing techniques , which have recently been exploited for exponentially efficient quantum process tomography @xcite .",
    "another open question is how to deliberately control the phases in the manufacturing step of a waveguide array .",
    "second , while we observed significant two - photon interference visibilities , the resulting probability distributions did not exhibit a conclusively quantum signature , as quantified by the witness defined in  @xcite .",
    "this was most likely due to the significant polarisation - dependent coupling and loss in the circuit , leading to non - unitary evolution which failed to preserve the coherence of the input quantum state .",
    "once we better understand the origins and mechanisms of these effects , we can exploit them to engineer devices such as polarisation - dependent couplers .",
    "it should be noted that these effects are certainly not inherent to the direct - write technique , as for example demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "future research should also focus on realising and studying effects of decoherence in continuous - time walks .",
    "many physical , biological or chemical systems are strongly coupled to their environment and decoherence has been suggested to be the driving factor behind phenomena such as environmentally - assisted quantum transport @xcite . while decoherence has been studied in discrete - time experiments @xcite , techniques for controllably introducing it to inherently robust waveguide lattices have yet to be demonstrated .",
    "we thank i.  kassal , b.  p.  lanyon , g.  g.  gillett , j.  c.  f.  matthews and j.  l.  obrien for valuable assistance .",

    "in the heisenberg picture , a light field input into a waveguide in this chip is subject to the coupled - oscillator hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the propagation constant in waveguide @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the coupling constant between waveguides @xmath56 and @xmath58 .",
    "the system then evolves in time according the unitary operator @xmath59 and the creation operators @xmath60 are subject to the heisenberg equation of motion @xmath61 = i\\beta a^{\\dagger}_{i } + i\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{6}c_{i , j}a^{\\dagger}_{j } , \\label{eq : evolution}\\ ] ] which has the solution @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the @xmath64 matrix of coupling constants with diagonal entries @xmath65 , and @xmath13 is the propagation distance along the waveguide array . note that this evolution is equivalent to the continuous - time quantum walk formalism  @xcite .    the interaction length @xmath13 of the waveguides is chosen to match the desired run time @xmath66 for the emulation of the hamiltonian .",
    "the overall response of the circuit as a 12-port beam - splitting device is then contained in the unitary matrix @xmath67 , and we can define a set of six output creation operators @xmath68 , with @xmath69 for the input operators @xmath70 .",
    "the coupling @xmath57 between two waveguides falls off exponentially with waveguide separation @xmath71  @xcite , so to design an array of the type discussed in this paper , the number of waveguides , their geometry , and their separations @xmath71 are chosen to reflect the properties of the hamiltonian under investigation .",
    "this determines the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath57 .",
    "an interaction length @xmath13 is chosen according to the desired emulation time @xmath66 .    to translate the theoretical design into a real experimental system , the geometry of the circuit is analysed in a numerical electromagnetic design suite , in our case _ rsoft _",
    "this program uses finite - difference algorithms to find solutions to maxwell s equations in dielectrics and can be used to optimise a set of physical parameters ( core diameter and refractive index contrast ) which will approximate the desired evolution .",
    "this provides the link between the hamiltonian evolution of the quantum system under study , and the physical properties of the experimental system .",
    "we now describe the two - photon evolution in the optical system .",
    "two temporally - indistinguishable input photons @xmath72 , for @xmath73 , give the joint detection probability @xmath74 of finding the state @xmath75 in output modes @xmath76 and @xmath77  @xcite : @xmath78 the matrix @xmath79 then describes the two - photon probability distributions in all combinations of output modes .",
    "in contrast , two distinguishable photons will evolve independently and obey the statistics of bernoulli trials .",
