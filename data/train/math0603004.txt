    "in this paper we continue the study of cartan subalgebras of infinite - dimensional root - reductive lie algebras initiated in @xcite . we refine and extend the description of cartan subalgebras of @xmath3 given in @xcite to the case of a general root - reductive lie algebra .",
    "we also solve the problem of describing the set of conjugacy classes of cartan subalgebras of the three simple root - reductive lie algebras @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , as well as of @xmath3 , under the group of automorphisms of the natural representation which preserve the lie algebra .",
    "root - reductive lie algebras are a specific class of locally finite lie algebras , and as background literature on locally finite lie algebras we recommend @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "here is a description of the contents of the paper .",
    "its first main part , sections [ sectiona ] and [ sectionb ] , is concerned with the definition and description of cartan subalgebras . according to @xcite ,",
    "a cartan subalgebra of @xmath3 can be defined as a locally nilpotent subalgebra which is the centralizer of the set of all semisimple parts of its own elements .",
    "we accept this definition for any locally reductive lie algebra @xmath4 and prove that similarly to the case of @xmath3 , cartan subalgebras are nothing but centralizers of arbitrary maximal toral subalgebras . in particular , a cartan subalgebra is always self - normalizing .",
    "we then prove that a cartan subalgebra can be characterized equivalently as a subalgebra @xmath5 which coincides with the set of @xmath6-locally nilpotent vectors in @xmath4 , where @xmath6 runs over all finite - dimensional subalgebras of @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , we show that if @xmath4 is a root - reductive lie algebra , any cartan subalgebra @xmath7 is nilpotent and coincides with the set of all @xmath7-locally nilpotent vectors in @xmath4 .",
    "the main new phenomenon in the case of a general root - reductive lie algebra versus the case of @xmath3 is that cartan subalgebras are no longer necessarily commutative and that the adjoint action of a cartan subalgebra @xmath7 on itself no longer has to be locally finite .",
    "we treat in detail the simple lie algebras @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the case of @xmath0 is very similar to the case of @xmath3 considered in @xcite .",
    "the main new result in the other two cases is that maximal toral subalgebras are in one - to - one correspondence with maximal orthogonal or symplectic self - dual systems of @xmath8-dimensional subspaces in the natural representation .",
    "similarly to the case of @xmath3 , such maximal self - dual systems do not have to span the natural representation , a phenomenon that gives rise to nonsplitting maximal toral subalgebras . in the case of @xmath1 the centralizer of a maximal toral subalgebra",
    "is in general nilpotent of depth no greater than @xmath9 but not necessarily commutative .",
    "remarkably enough , the ideal of nilpotent elements of a cartan subalgebra of @xmath1 is itself a nilpotent orthogonal lie algebra of a vector space with a degenerate symmetric form , and all such nilpotent degenerate algebras occur inside cartan subalgebras of @xmath1 . in the case of @xmath0 ,",
    "the analogous nilpotent degenerate subalgebras do not occur inside cartan subalgebras of @xmath0 , and for @xmath3 and @xmath2 , there are no analogous nilpotent nonabelian subalgebras , which is consistent with the fact that @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 admit only abelian cartan subalgebras .    in section [ sectionc ]",
    "we address the conjugacy problem for cartan subalgebras posed in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in the case of @xmath3 it was established that certain standard discrete invariants of cartan subalgebras are not sufficient to characterize the conjugacy classes of cartan subalgebras of @xmath3 with respect to the group of automorphisms of the natural representation which preserve @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we describe the missing continuous invariants in terms of a linear algebraic structure which we call a complement datum . our main theorem in the second part , theorem [ equivthm ] , solves the conjugacy problem in terms of the combinatorics of complement data .",
    "it turns out that for a generic set of fixed standard invariants , there are uncountably many conjugacy classes of cartan subalgebras . in all remaining cases , there are only finitely many conjugacy classes , and in fact at most @xmath9 .",
    "we give criteria to distinguish the uncountable and finite cases and provide representatives in each finite case .",
    "all vector spaces and lie algebras are defined over the field of complex numbers @xmath10 .",
