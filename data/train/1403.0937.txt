    "since the discovery of the galactic halo @xcite , its structure and origin have been under intense debate .",
    "three main sources of halo stars have been discussed in the past ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion ) : monolithic collapse in early galaxy formation as put forth by @xcite ; the accretion of satellites @xcite ; and kick - up of disc / bulge stars via minor mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ejections from cluster cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or binary interactions @xcite involving a supermassive or intermediate mass black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "of these the second is considered to be the dominant contribution to the galactic halo based on @xmath0 cosmological simulations and from observational data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the impact of kicked out stars is strongly limited theoretically , as well as observationally by the low number of metal - rich halo stars .",
    "it can be hypothesized that stars from an initial collapse should on average carry some prograde momentum . for accreted stars , early studies @xcite , recently confirmed by @xcite ,",
    "suggested that dynamic friction differentiates between prograde and retrograde infalling satellites , leaving behind a potentially detectable asymmetry in kinematics .",
    "it is , however , not clear , how this signature should translate into different rotation as a function of metallicity .",
    "@xcite found that the accretion signatures along with radial abundance gradients vary strongly in simulated galaxies , depending strongly on the individual accretion history .    in principle three",
    "different observational signatures have been proposed :    * asymmetry in the ( azimuthal ) velocity distribution , which may be a consequence of dynamic friction . however , other processes as well as the special accretion history can lead to such a distribution .",
    "this dates back to @xcite , but it has been known since @xcite and later @xcite that distance errors can account for this type of asymmetries . * radial metallicity gradients . as noted before , these depend on the specific accretion history of a galaxy . by tendency",
    "the material accreted later onto a galaxy stems from less dense regions that evolved later and produced less massive stellar systems ( this was already pointed out by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hence are likely to have a lower metallicity .",
    "claims of related differences between the inner and outer halo were made as early as @xcite and @xcite . * radial gradients in angular momentum/",
    "mean azimuthal velocity .",
    "again , this hinges on the detailed accretion history , correlating velocities and metallicities to varying degree and sign . for our galaxy ,",
    "bhb stars set quite narrow limits on any radial trend @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ( hereafter c07 and c10 ) claimed the existence of a dual halo that consists of a prograde , metal - rich ( @xmath1}}\\approx -1.6 $ ] ) , inner halo and a distinct retrograde , more metal - poor ( @xmath1}}\\approx -2.2 $ ] ) , outer halo .",
    "this observational result triggered a major series of theoretical papers finding such structures in simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while some other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find no convincing trends .",
    "the result was criticized by @xcite ( hereafter sac11),tracing their claims back to the inappropriate use of gaussian analysis and the neglect of observational errors , as well as unphysical distance estimates in their sample .",
    "accounting for these effects , sac11 showed that on any reasonable adopted distance scale , including c10 s own distances , their findings of a halo duality vanished .",
    "recently @xcite ( hereafter b12 ) published a re - analysis affirmative of the original c07,10 studies , finding again a dual halo with a retrograde metal - poor component .",
    "it could be argued that this question will soon be answered by the gaia satellite mission .",
    "while this is likely true , the purpose of the present paper is more general , i.e. to lay out on the example of b12 the many subtleties due to selection biases and error analysis , which all studies of this kind even with gaia data need to address in order to derive meaningful conclusions . with this spirit",
    "we make the data used in this work publicly available to enable independent investigations on the topic by others .    in this work",
    "we will focus on the question of halo duality and evaluate the evidence presented so far .",
    "we will focus on the arguments as laid out by b12 and rely on the distance scale of b12 , since in sac11 we already did an extensive study of other available distance prescriptions . in section [ sec : replica ]",
    "we describe our attempt to replicate those distance assignments and discuss the distance calibrations of @xcite .",
    "we examine the central points of observational evidence as put forth by b12 in section [ sec : arguments ] .",
    "further arguments that have been used in favour of a dual halo detection are evaluated in section [ sec : evidence ] . in section [ sec : conclude ] we summarize our conclusions : none of the arguments put forward by c07 , c10 and b12 hold up to closer scrutiny , and therefore , at present , there is no evidence for a dual halo structure with a retrograde metal - poor outer halo component in the segue / sdss data .",
    "as in the previous studies we use the sample of photometric and reddening standard stars in segue @xcite .",
    "the sample selection is identical to sac11 ; in addition we remove stars with expected reddening of more than @xmath2 in the @xmath3-band and apply the proper motion and radial velocity corrections given by @xcite - despite being necessary for obtaining a clean sample , neither of these steps has a significant impact on the analysis .    in sac11",
    "we did an extensive study of dual halo signatures on four different distance scales bracketing the reasonable range of scales in the literature , and found no hint of duality in any of them .",
    "since b12 used the difference in distance calibrations to argue why their finding of a dual halo is still correct , we will now solely examine their evidence on their own distance scale .",
    "we note that the one distance scale that b12 wrongly ascribed to us and made a central element of their criticism , is in fact not ours : it is @xmath4 shorter than the adaptation of the @xcite distance calibration we used as one of four distance scales ( see the appendix for details ) .    while b12 use different distance estimators , most of their statistics are based on a revision of the c10 distances , which we will call b12 distances and use throughout this work . in the following section we describe our calibration efforts .",
    "we would have preferred to use their distances , but our requests to obtain their adopted distances were declined . therefore , to check the correctness of our derivation , we compare our result to the older data set of c10 , to which we have access .",
    "the basic idea of the c07 , c10 and b12 distance calibrations is the strategy of @xcite to classify stars by their gravities and then sort them into different branches ( luminosity classes ) .",
    "b12 still assign stars with @xmath5 into the main sequence branch and stars with @xmath6 into a subgiant branch .",
    "the intermediate objects with @xmath7 are considered to be  turn - off  stars placed on a sequence half - way in magnitude between the dwarf and subgiant branches .",
    "for the clearly unphysical objects redwards of the oldest possible turn - off point , b12 modified their approach by sorting stars with @xmath8 to the subgiant branch and objects with @xmath9 into the dwarf sequence .",
    "this re - sorting , which affects nearly all metal - poor turnoff stars , does not resolve the general problem of assigning a wrong luminosity class to a fraction of the objects . in the unphysical position intermediate between the true relations , they all had an error of @xmath10 .",
    "now they are in permitted locations , but their intermediate surface gravity determinations imply errors of @xmath11 ( in both directions ) for an unknown number of stars that are misidentified as dwarfs or subgiants .",
    "we know that there is a substantial number of misassignments both from the calibration on globular clusters ( i.e. errors in derived @xmath12 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from the distance statistics of @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitudes on the three branches are taken from the calibrations of @xcite , which are , however , formulated in johnson bands @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "hence they transform the sdss colours into johnson colours via the linear relationships derived by @xcite .",
    "these neglect any non - linear terms like those found by @xcite and also any metallicity dependence , which are difficult to detect on the @xcite sample of only @xmath15 stars .",
    "@xcite have only a coarse grid in metallicity for their colour - magnitude relations , which comprises just three different metallicity values .",
    "how they perform interpolation / extrapolation between these three points in metallicity is not described by @xcite nor by b12 , but from a comment in @xcite we conclude that the most likely scheme is cubic splines with the natural boundary condition .",
    "as we can not access the b12 distances , we can not directly test our replica .",
    "however , we can compare to their older data , which are shown with red crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : isccomp ] . for this plot we selected metal - poor objects with @xmath16 } } < -2.1 $ ] .",
    "all colours are transformed via the @xcite formula into the johnson - cousins system .",
    "the absolute @xmath14-band magnitudes are taken from the old c10 data .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isccomp ] are basti isochrones @xcite for ages of @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath1}}= -2.27 $ ] .",
    "comparison with the isochrones shows again the un - physical `` turn - off '' objects from c07 and c10 as well as the surprising fourth sequence ( labelled `` unknown '' in fig .  [ fig : isccomp ] ) between dwarfs and turn - off stars .",
    "we can not judge if the latter is addressed in their new calibration .",
    "comparison to the published plots in b12 and the c10 data shows that the derived sequences ( in particular the main sequence ) are in the right place .",
    "however , the replicated data show a remaining stump of the turn - off sequence , which appears absent in fig . 2 from b12 .",
    "b12 define a critical temperature @xmath19 , @xmath20 colder than the temperature of the isochrone turn - off , below which they re - sort stars on the turn - off branch into the two other sequences ( see equation 1 and fig . 1 in b12 ) .",
    "the only possible solution to the discrepancy appears to be _ adding _ the @xmath20 instead of subtracting them .",
    "this gives the blue points in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : isccomp ] . we will adopt this solution throughout the paper .",
    "apart from the well - agreeing sequence locations , both the old c10 sample ( red points in fig .",
    "[ fig : isccomp ] and fig .",
    "2 of b12 show significantly more magnitude scatter than our derivation .",
    "we can not explain this scatter by metallicity differences , which should be small at such low metallicities .",
    "this is not a systematic shift , but likely enhances the lutz - kelker bias in their sample .      reproducing the b12/c10 absolute magnitudes finally reveals the origin of the difference between c10 and the isochrones in sdss colours :",
    "the @xcite calibrations are brighter than the stellar models in johnson colours : both the red points and the blue main sequence lie clearly above the isochrones in fig .",
    "[ fig : isccomp ] .",
    "which one is correct ?",
    "though b12 state that the @xcite distance calibration is based on hipparcos parallaxes , this is only true for metal - rich stars . for metal - poor stars",
    "there are hardly any reliable hipparcos parallaxes and none for globular clusters .",
    "yet , there would be indirect calibrations for metal - poor clusters by using the few hipparcos parallaxes for very metal - poor stars .",
    "this was done , e.g. , by @xcite , who derived a distance modulus of @xmath21 for @xmath22 , compared to a @xmath23 derived via isochrone fitting from @xcite .",
    "instead of using these hipparcos derived parallaxes for their metal poor clusters , @xcite relied on a calibration of horizontal branch star magnitudes . since they did not report their derived distance moduli , we can not determine why their magnitude assignments deviate so far from well - calibrated models .",
    "the @xcite transformation from johnson to sdss is significantly bluer ( by about @xmath24 at low metallicities ) than the predictions from model atmospheres entering the basti @xcite models .",
    "this follows from its missing metallicity dependence , which forces a compromise between the different line - blanketing of metal - poor and metal - rich stars .",
    "the blue bias of the transformation for metal - poor stars helps to reduce the difference between the isochrones and the b00/b12 main sequence calibration in the sdss system to about @xmath25 , smaller than in the johnson - cousins system to which the b00/b12 calibration is native . still we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : iscompz ] that in contrast to the b00/b12 calibration the isochrones match the photometry for the cluster @xmath22 very well on the main sequence with adopted standard reddening of @xmath26 and a distance modulus of @xmath27 , in concordance with the hipparcos - based calibration of @xmath22 .    in summary",
    ", the bright bias of the b12 main sequence calibration in sdss colours traces back to the calibrations of @xcite being up to @xmath28 brighter than the isochrones in johnson colours , mitigated to some extent by the transformations between the colour systems .",
    "after replicating the b12 distance assignments , we can analyse their main three arguments for a dual galactic halo : i ) declining metallicity in their sample towards larger altitudes , ii ) the decomposition of the observed azimuthal velocity distribution into gaussians and iii ) their argument that the proper motions of retrograde stars are highly different from the rest of the sample . in the following subsections",
    "we address each of these claims , arguing that none bears closer scrutiny .      as laid out in the introduction ,",
    "radial abundance trends are not a signature of halo duality and can be either caused by the specific accretion history @xcite or by kick - up of disc stars .",
    "as the sun is at a significant distance from the galactic centre , such a radial gradient should in principle be reflected as well by a local gradient in altitude @xmath29 .",
    "b12 claim that the metallicity of halo stars decreases with altitude @xmath29 ( see their fig . 13 and corresponding discussion ) down to a peak metallicity of @xmath1}}\\sim -2.2 $ ] at an altitude of @xmath30 .",
    "they identify this as a clear transition from an inner to an outer halo in their picture of a halo duality .",
    "bias control in such an investigation is key : not only do we expect altitude - dependent disc contamination ; this sample exemplifies metallicity - dependent luminosity biases and selection effects . here",
    "we will follow the standard route of statistical analysis : we derive bias controlled statistics in the next subsection and in the following parts provide the causal reasoning / backgrounds by analysing the exact origin of the bias affecting the b12 findings .",

    "the linear fit may not reflect a perfect assumption , but gives a direct measure of the correlation between altitude @xmath29 and metallicities .",
    "however , most of this decline is caused by the transition from disc to halo towards higher altitudes . to isolate the galactic halo , we limit our sample to @xmath1 } } < -1.4 $ ] , where the disc contamination at lower altitudes should vanish in the present sample as evident in fig . 6 of @xcite .",
    "we can see this also from the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : ztrendlim ] - the curve has a kink at @xmath1}}\\approx -1 $ ] where the bulk of disc contamination ends .",
    "the weakening trend towards even lower metallicities is caused less by disc contamination than the subsequent narrowing of the available metallicity range . at those low metallicities",
    "there is still a negative slope with a striking significance of @xmath53 .",
    "is it real ?",
    "we will show that this is not the case .    in statistics",
    "a well - known phenomenon is the omitted variable bias : let there be a causal connection between a quantity @xmath54 and a quantity @xmath55 .",
    "however , we measure the dependence of @xmath54 on another variable @xmath56 , which is not causally connected to @xmath54 , but correlated with @xmath55 . in this case we will infer an artificial correlation between @xmath56 and @xmath54 after neglecting @xmath55 .",
    "the standard solution to this problem is controlling for the omitted variable by including it into a simultaneous fit of @xmath54 against @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "an omitted variable bias is demonstrated if the trend gets significantly altered or even vanishes after inclusion of the additional variable .",
    "note however , that the reverse case is not true : finding a trend with inclusion of one omitted variable does not prove its reliability , since there might be missing variables , or the wrong functional form is used in the fit .    in our case",

    ", the average altitude @xmath58 will by the geometry rise almost linearly with distance @xmath57 , and hence the two quantities are strongly correlated . the strong polewards bias ( i.e. most stars are at high galactic latitudes @xmath59 ) of the segue sample exacerbates this correlation . at the same time , @xmath1}}$ ] is correlated with distance : stars with lower metallicity are brighter than more metal - rich stars of similar mass and age , so that metal - poor stars can be seen further away . in a general sample selection",
    "this competes with the colour shift : metal - rich stars are redder , so that at fixed colour metal - rich main sequence stars are brighter than their metal - poor counterparts . for the subgiant branch we only have the first effect , since metal - poor subgiant stars are in general brighter than metal - rich ones .",
    "in addition , the gravities of stars , as determined by the segue pipeline , are significantly lower on the metal - poor end ( for @xmath1 } } < -1 { \\,{\\rm dex}}$ ] the `` main sequence '' density ridge slopes by @xmath60 in gravity per @xmath61 in metallicity ) , and the observational error is larger ( see section [ sec : ddd ] below ) , making them more prone to be selected for the turn - off or subgiant branches in the b12 scheme with its fixed gravity cuts .",
    "thus , in order to claim a trend of metallicities with altitude one must prove that this trend does not come from a selection effect in distance @xmath57 .",

    "[ fig : planestats ] , the stars with lower gravities dominate the longer distance range as they are sorted into the turn - off or subgiant sequences ( with limits @xmath69 , and @xmath70 ) . since the @xmath71 pipeline has a strong correlation between metallicity and gravity ( see fig . 3 in sac11 ) , it comes as no surprise that we measured a strong distance bias in metallicity .",

    "the underlying metallicity distribution is constant in space , but the measurement induces strong malmquist - like biases .",
    "the red sample cut - off leads to a metallicity rise at the smallest distances : metal - poor stars on the main sequence are , at fixed colour , less luminous than their metal - rich counterparts and can thus enter the sample at smaller distances . just beyond @xmath72",
    "the metallicity drops . at this point the turn - off , which essentially gives the maximum luminosity of the bulk of stars , reaches the faint cut - off of the sample .",
    "since metal - poor populations have a brighter turn - off and subgiant branch , they will dominate the far part of the sample .",
    "the @xmath72 drop is connected to the first magnitude limit of @xmath107 in the considered sample .",
    "further out , the fainter sample selection dominates and gives rise to a second metallicity peak , followed by a drop beyond @xmath73 , where the sample only contains subgiants and giants .",
    "the effect is again exacerbated by the red cut - off , which further reduces the relative number of metal - rich stars in the sample .",
    "compared to perfect distances ( blue line ) the b12 distances together with the pipeline errors ( dark red line ) enhance the metallicity drop around @xmath108 .",
    "while the dark red line approximates the qualitative structure of the observations remarkably well , there are mild quantitative differences . in particular the metallicity of the nearest stars is overestimated .",
    "this is certainly not a `` real '' trend , but derives from our rough assumptions like a fixed reddening , or the rough shape of the metallicity distribution . indeed",
    "the exact shape of the replica depends quite strongly on the assumed pipeline errors , age structure , initial mass function and much more .",
    "had we used `` perfect '' gravities and metallicities on our mock sample , the overall structure would be shifted massively inwards as depicted by the light red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bmetreplica ] : the gravity cuts of the b12 distances are deep in the subgiant regime and hence on clean gravity determinations would lead to a prevalence of distance underestimates . any further refinement on the mock catalogue",
    "would hence primarily serve to understand the segue errors and selection rather than advancing the discussion on halo structure .",
    "two important points should be taken away from this section :    * in a sample that is not volume complete , the metallicity distribution can not be explored without extensive bias correction .",
    "this is apparent from the fact that the unbiased sample ( green line ) already showed significant metallicity effects .",
    "even if we had perfect distances , we would suffer from both the magnitude and colour selection and hence a spatially dependent bias would remain . * our understanding of the detailed distance dependence of metallicities in the sample complements the statistical analysis from the previous section .",
    "it confirms that the data are consistent with no change in mean metallicity throughout the extent of the sample out to an altitude of about @xmath109 .",
    "however , the statistical analysis provides a more robust value , since it filters the distance dependence without requiring knowledge of the detailed errors and biases in the sample .",
    "it shows that at @xmath1 } } < -1.4 { \\,{\\rm dex}}$ ] the data are consistent with a constant metallicity . any vertical trend in these data is less than a third of the b12 claim , i.e. smaller than @xmath110 .",
    "b12 make a similar claim for bhb star metallicities , now not as a function of altitude but as a function of galactocentric distance .",
    "the effect is very small ( less than @xmath111 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : xuebhbmet ] ) , and it is nearly impossible to reliably disentangle it from a distance bias .",
    "a clean separation further out in the halo is not reliable , because distance from the sun becomes degenerate with the distance from the galactic centre .",
    "additionally the signal to noise ratio will affect the observed width of the metallicity distribution and related parameters .",
    "@xcite report not only a larger error in measured line - widths at lower signal to noise ratios , but also a significant systematic shift due to issues with continuum placement .",
    "hence it is reasonable to expect some metallicity shift with signal to noise ratio and hence distance .",
    "the @xcite method is also vulnerable to small colour errors as small as @xmath112 , which are expected at large distances ( high observed magnitude ) and at low latitudes ( reddening uncertainty ) , reporting a @xmath32}}}$ ] of up to @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , distances to bhb stars depend significantly on their metallicity with metal - poor stars being about @xmath114 brighter @xcite in the g - band , such that the precautions of the above subsection fully apply .",
    "we can also test for another influence on the trend : the galactic disc .",
    "b12 cut in galactocentric radius , while for their bhb sample they did not discuss and examine the dependence on the altitude above the galactic plane .",
    "especially the lower latitudes of the sample will carry a disc contamination that evokes a spurious trend .",
    "in addition it is not known how far contamination by the bulge extends into the galactic halo , and the sample contains a significant number of stars at low galactocentric distances and relatively low altitudes ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) .",
    "note also that the disc contamination can exceed the normal geometric limits of the disc because of a significant contamination with blue stragglers that have distance overestimates @xcite . in our determination of the radial metallicity trend in the sample",
    "we hence vary the lower limit of the altitude @xmath58 as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : xuebhbmet ] . indeed , for the @xcite metallicities we encounter a very mild negative trend of metallicity with galactocentric radius @xmath117 for the entire sample .",
    "however , the trend diminishes successively while we move up the cut to censor regions of likely disc contamination .",
    "further , the trend noted by b12 only exists when using the @xcite metallicities .",
    "if we use instead the pipeline adopted metallicities from segue dr8 ( blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : xuebhbmet ] ) , the trend starts at a very small value and becomes already insignificant at a limiting altitude of @xmath118 .",
    "we note , however , that there is an increase in the metallicity spread noticed by an increase in the number of both objects with @xmath1 } } < -2.5 $ ] and @xmath1 } } > -1.5 $ ] at larger distances .",
    "the dispersion increase might be real , but we can not cleanly disentangle it from a natural increase in the observational error .    in summary , we can not detect any reliable downtrend of mean metallicity with galactocentric radius that is robust against a disc contamination .",
    "the observed azimuthal velocity distribution is frequently used to decompose an observed data set into single components . sac11 and @xcite emphasized the fact that a typical disc velocity distribution is not symmetric and has a long tail towards lower velocities , providing new and physically motivated fitting functions to replace the unphysical gaussian functions .",
    "b12 tried to circumvent this problem by examining the velocity distribution of stars they can by metallicity classify as halo stars and again attempt a gaussian decomposition .",
    "however , this does not address the fundamental failure of decompositions in terms of gaussian distributions to characterize inherently non - gaussian distributions , which was one of our main concerns raised in sac11 .",
    "* there is expectation that the halo azimuthal velocity distribution should be gaussian .",
    "dynamic friction may influence the shape , as well as the relaxation time for single halo stars is longer than a hubble time , so a fully thermalized halo velocity distribution can not be expected . *",
    "the observational error distribution that has to be folded with the underlying velocity distributions to obtain the final observed velocity distribution is highly non - gaussian .",
    "while the non - gaussianity caused by using photometric parallaxes has been known at least since @xcite , it is commonly known as a @xcite bias , who demonstrated its existence for geometric parallaxes .",
    "it is inevitable that the b12 sample is affected by this bias and correction for it is essential , which however was not done by b12 even though it was one of the key concerns we had articulated in sac11 .",
    "the non - gaussian error on distances translates directly into a non - gaussian deformation of the velocity distribution .",
    "the long tail of distance overestimates translates to a long tail of the velocity distribution away from the solar velocity , i.e. into the retrograde regime .",
    "this was already pointed out by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "this distortion is not only caused by distance overestimates : distance underestimates , and misidentifications of evolved stars as dwarfs yield a distribution skewed in the same way , as they create a narrower shifted onto the prograde side .",
    "an attempt to fit such a left - skewed distribution at moderate data precision with gaussians will usually produce an unphysical split into a strong component centred around the maximum and a weaker component out in the long tail .",
    "in addition , proper motion errors themselves are highly non - gaussian ( though usually symmetric ) due to a major magnitude dependence of astrometric precision @xcite .",
    "these proper motion errors multiply with the varying distance and angle terms , so that velocity errors generated by them are highly non - gaussian .",
    "a typical outcome of trying to fit data with such unphysical functional components is large scatter in parameters and unphysical parameters ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that can not be properly explained by just the moderate distance shifts between the different methods .",
    "this is exactly what can be observed in the results of c10 and b12 .",
    "[ fig : beersfits ] shows the mean azimuthal velocities of their low ( i.e. more retrograde and identified as an outer halo ) component on the x - axis against the mean azimuthal velocities of their high component ( more prograde , their inner halo component ) on the y - axis under their different selections and applied distance scales .",
    "the red error bars are their general dwarf samples , while the green error bars restrict those samples to stars that in their analysis reach altitudes in excess of @xmath119 .",
    "unsurprisingly , the latter samples favour more retrograde components , because they have a bias towards stars that are further away and have a high proper motion impact on @xmath120 ( and have hence lower accuracy in their kinematics ) , as well as stars with distance overestimates .",
    "blue error bars depict the full sample with their new distance calibration .",
    "clearly the exact rotational velocities for the two claimed halo components differ wildly depending on the chosen distance prescriptions and how exactly the analysis of c07 , c10 and b12 is carried out .",
    "to assess the halo velocity distribution with an appropriate error analysis , we make the crude assumption of an underlying gaussian distribution and fold it with the following error terms :    * the proper motion errors , which can be treated as approximately gaussian for single stars .",
    "we calculate the distribution of velocity errors resulting from the positions and proper motion errors of each single star and fold it onto the velocity distribution . *",
    "a correction for distance errors .",
    "those are highly non - gaussian if we assume a gaussian magnitude error .",
    "we use values of @xmath121 and @xmath122 , corresponding to a distance error of approximately @xmath123 and @xmath124 . * a smaller correction for velocity crossovers via the distance uncertainty as discussed by @xcite , which should be approximately symmetric in velocity space .",
    "we keep this at a conservative @xmath125 .",
    "[ fig : vanothertime ] shows the azimuthal velocity distributions of stars with metallicities of @xmath1 } } < -1.9 $ ] . for our fits",
    "we use the mean velocity , the width , and the normalization of the underlying gaussian term as free parameters . for both values of @xmath126",
    "we include also a case where we model the identification errors that will occur in the sample .",
    "for this case we use both an underestimated and an overestimated fraction , each comprising @xmath127 of the total sample and having an additional @xmath128 offset .",
    "this is a rather conservative estimate , regarding the fact that a main - sequence - subgiant identification error amounts to @xmath129 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : isccomp ] ) .",
    "similarly , the number of misidentified stars is chosen far on the low side .",
    "most objects are near the turn - off and very hot and metal - poor . for these stars ,",
    "gravity determinations are very difficult , due to the disappearance of suitable temperature and pressure broadened wings at the typical signal to noise ratio and spectral resolution for segue .",
    "this renders the correct identification of luminosity classes very difficult .",
    "this is also shown by their distance statistics .",
    "the linear distance estimator from @xcite flags an average @xmath130 distance overestimate contamination with @xmath131 distance overestimates gives an average @xmath132 distance overestimate . ] at @xmath133 significance for the subgiants with @xmath1 } } < -1.9 $ ] , opposing a fair average distance for the declared dwarfs . for the latter , the misidentified subgiants balance the overestimated main sequence distances .",
    "we show the underlying velocity distribution fit for the latter model .",
    "the differences are subtle , but a higher @xmath134 expands the left wing while shifting the peak a little bit into the prograde regime , whereas the identification errors mostly show up at the broader wings .",
    "the comparison to the unfolded distribution ( black ) demonstrates how much more the left ( retrograde ) wing is enhanced by the symmetric magnitude errors .",
    "neglecting the observational error asymmetry would drive at least one other ( artificial ) component in a gaussian decomposition , as indeed we argue has happened in c07 , c10 and b12 .",
    "the determinations for the underlying parameters of the velocity distribution are dominated by systematic errors : the dispersion values vary between @xmath135 for @xmath136 without identification errors and @xmath137 for @xmath138 accounting for identification errors . since we likely underestimate the uncertainties the real azimuthal velocity dispersion of the halo should be around @xmath139 or markedly lower .",
    "the mean azimuthal velocity varies between @xmath140 and @xmath141 , consistent with a non - rotating or at best weakly prograde halo .",
    "however , this is a gross underestimate of the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the value shifts by @xmath142 when distances are shifted by @xmath143 , in addition to the uncertainty in the solar azimuthal velocity of another @xmath144 . note also that as a consequence of their stark distance overestimates the subgiants display a mean azimuthal velocity about @xmath145 lower than the dwarf stars at the same metallicity .",
    "these problems can be partly remedied by better quality cuts and , by applying the distance corrections of @xcite and by using robust estimators . however ,",
    "this has been already done by @xcite for the local sample and @xcite for bhb stars , who found a non - rotating or at best weakly prograde galactic halo .    within the expected magnitude and identification uncertainties ,",
    "the wings of the distribution can be fully explained by just the observational errors , without having to deviate from the simplistic underlying gaussian velocity distribution ( which would not yet imply the presence of a second component ) .",
    "hence the azimuthal velocity distribution offers not the least hint of any halo duality .",
    "b12 argue that their retrograde halo stars are real , because their distribution in the proper motion plane is different from the rest of the sample .",
    "specifically , b12 argued that _",
    "`` if the retrograde signature were indeed created in the manner suggested by s10 alone ( and the stars we assign to a highly retrograde tail were otherwise identical in their kinematic properties to the rest of the low - metallicity halo stars ) , we would a priori expect their observed proper motions to be drawn from the same parent population as those not in the tail . '' _    the strategy to refute this argument is to construct a mock sample and to show that distance errors produce many false retrograde objects , while these objects display a remarkable difference in proper motion space compared to the rest of the sample .",
    "we note first that even with a single gaussian - shaped halo velocity distribution centred at zero we would expect @xmath146 to @xmath147 of all stars to have @xmath148 .",
    "hence we do not claim that all strongly retrograde stars are spurious , but that the majority of observations in this region is a consequence of observational errors .",
    "further , it is easier to move a star by observational errors from @xmath149 to @xmath150 than from @xmath151 .",
    "hence the `` a priori '' claim of b12 that a lutz - kelker bias draws stars equally from the entire parent population is a priori wrong .",
    "distance errors actually tend to enhance the contrasts between the thought - to - be retrograde tail population and the parent population , especially in a sample like segue , where the polewards bias makes proper motions the dominant part in the azimuthal velocity measurements .",
    "distance errors in a measurement affect exclusively the part of motion relative to the sun that is carried by the proper motions . ] where @xmath152 is the identity matrix , @xmath57 the true distance , @xmath153 the fractional distance error and @xmath154 if a star has negligible proper motion , its distance has nearly no impact on the derived velocity vector . ]",
    "thus , the presence of distance errors is only able to sweep stars into spurious retrograde orbits when these stars have a considerable proper motion , i.e. the likelihood of a star being wrongly sorted into retrograde motion vanishes at the origin ( 0,0 ) in the proper motion plane and generally increases with proper motion . in turn , the density contrast between stars with high and low @xmath120 around the origin of the proper motion plane will commonly intensify in the presence of distance errors .",
    "let us examine this effect in a mock sample depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scrambdist ] .",
    "following @xcite we use a sample of @xmath155 halo stars with a gaussian distribution with zero mean velocity and dispersions @xmath156 .",
    "if we plotted the entire sample , it would be fully centred around the origin of the proper motion plane . to make the test resemble more the segue sample we only select stars towards the galactic anticentre ( @xmath157 ) and in the northern galactic hemisphere ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "again this is not supposed to be a realistic galaxy , nor a good match to segue , which has a narrower and more ragged angle distribution .",
    "the result , assuming a perfect measurement without any errors , is shown with blue dots in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scrambdist ] .",
    "red data points depict the strongly retrograde stars with @xmath148 . since there are only @xmath159 such stars , black crosses highlight in addition the stars with @xmath160 to visualize the spatial distribution . in the middle panel",
    "we apply typical errors for a sample , using @xmath161 in both proper motion components , @xmath162 in the line - of - sight velocities , combined with a systematic distance error of @xmath163 plus a random distance error of @xmath164 . as a consequence",
    "the number of stars deemed to be retrograde multiplies by a factor of @xmath165 . for the reasons laid out above the spurious members are at high proper motion ,",
    "while virtually no false detections get added at lower proper motions , where the proper motions are just too small to change the velocities considerably ( as a back - of - the - envelope calculation , consider that @xmath166 at @xmath167 distance correspond to @xmath168 in transverse velocity , which have to be multiplied with the geometrical factor ( @xmath169 ) and the fractional distance error ) .    to consider a really extreme case",
    ", we assign completely random distances with @xmath170 to each star in the bottom panel .",
    "though virtually all of our detections are wrong , the contrast between the sample distributions is actually enhanced ( the relative density around the origin in the retrograde sample has measurably diminished ) with similar asymmetric distribution in the proper motion plane as the case without any observational errors but obviously with many more spurious retrograde objects and with more pronounced asymmetry in azimuthal velocities .",
    "such an asymmetry was argued by b12 to clearly demonstrate that the highly retrograde stars must be drawn from a different parent distribution than the stars with less pronounced rotation .",
    "the above illustration plainly shows that no such conclusion can be inferred from their proper motions .",
    "in particular , one can not directly interpret structure in the proper motion plane together with kinematic cuts .",
    "the argument turns even in the opposite way : the prominent proper motion structure seen by b12 would , if anything , indicate that many of their highly retrograde objects are artificial .    to summarize",
    ", none of the arguments of b12 bears up under closer scrutiny . in none of these statistics we can find even a hint of a halo duality ; instead , this discussion serves as a prime example for the importance of sound error analysis and the danger of hidden biases .",
    "@xcite claimed a difference in rotation between more metal - poor and more metal - rich bhb stars .",
    "while it is not clear support for the very particular claims of c10 and b12 of a retrograde , metal - poor _ outer _ halo , it seemed to support a rotation difference between metal - poor and metal - rich bhb stars while not finding a radial dependence .",
    "@xcite re - analysed this work and found that this result vanishes when stricter quality criteria are applied to the data .",
    "they also found that different estimators of rotation are inconsistent on the original sample and no reliable difference in rotation can be detected .",
    "similarly , @xcite found that there is no trend of rotational tendency with galactocentric distance , which contrasts to the findings of @xcite .",
    "we suspect that the latter result can be ascribed to the very small sample size , the very narrow range in lines of sight , especially with no line - of - sight velocity support for @xmath120 measurements and the use of partially untested proper motions like sdss dr7 @xcite , which are now corrected in dr9 @xcite .    similarly , the notion of b12 about the galactocentric radial velocities of bhb stars in the sample of @xcite demands investigation ( see their fig .",
    "while the b12 claim is not backed by a correct statistical test , this issue was examined by @xcite .",
    "there is actually a statistically significant difference within the sample , but it is not a clean distinction between the metal - poor and the more metal - rich bhb stars .",
    "it derives from a difference within the metal - poor population , i.e. between the hottest and the cooler metal - poor bhb stars , while the cooler bhb stars show no difference towards any metal - rich subsample .",
    "hence this is either interesting substructure in the halo , or a problem with segue line - of - sight velocities . at the spectral resolution and typical",
    "signal to noise ratios of segue , hot and metal - poor bhb stars display no metal lines for the determination of their line - of - sight velocities , such that the pipeline has to rely on the very broad balmer resulting in large uncertainties .",
    "hence , the difference points to an unreliable spectral analysis .",
    "furthermore @xcite examined the subsample in question and found no evidence for a retrograde motion when using more reliable 3d - estimators for rotation .",
    "@xcite found a strong radial metallicity gradient in a photometric study of the galactic halo .",
    "we note that such a gradient does not constitute halo duality .",
    "@xcite did not correct selection effects and so without studying their sample in detail we face a similar selection bias as b12 : metal - poor stars are brighter than their metal - rich counterparts , thus they can be observed further away .",
    "their metallicity transition happens around @xmath171 distance , where the distance modulus brings the turn - off magnitudes into the proximity of the faint cut - off and higher magnitude errors .",
    "since their most metal - poor isochrone is nearly @xmath172 magnitude brighter than their intermediate isochrone , there will be an increasing impact of the lowest metallicity on their analysis , an effect they do not correct for .",
    "more importantly , we can directly see the pattern expected from a selection effect in their figures . in their fig .",
    "6 the metallicity transition between their two `` halo populations '' is not only roughly circular around the sun in the in - plane - distance vs. altitude plots , but more importantly it happens near an in - plane - distance @xmath173 at all galactic angles @xmath174 .",
    "this translates into a galactocentric radius @xmath175 for @xmath176 in contrast to @xmath177 for @xmath178 . to reconcile the two angles , the transition for @xmath176 would have to take place around @xmath179 and hence outside their plots . without a rigorous demonstration that their trends is not a selection effect ( and hence that we live in a rather particular halo that is strongly elongated along the sun - galactic centre connection while appearing roughly circular around the sun )",
    ", we speculate that we are facing the same phenomenon of a spurious trend with radius as in the b12 analysis and explained in section [ sec : radmet ] .",
    "the increase of substructure with galactocentric radius , as found by @xcite is expected from many theoretical models : the material in the outskirts of the galactic halo is expected to have been accreted on average later and experiences less friction / scatter by the galactic disc and central regions so that naturally should display more substructure .",
    "hence , the results of @xcite and @xcite are expected .",
    "however , that does not provide evidence specifically for a dual halo with a retrograde , metal - poor outer component .",
    "finally , we note that the presence of theoretical papers advocating the physical possibility of a halo duality is interesting , but by no means constitutes any evidence that this is the case for the milky way , especially since the theoretical community is not unanimous in this respect .",
    "we have studied the arguments presented by b12 for a dual halo with a retrograde , metal - poor outer component and conclude that none of them stands up to critical examination .    in the course of our replication of the b12 analysis we found that the relations from @xcite are significantly brighter than stellar models in the johnson v - band .",
    "in addition we checked their performance on m92 and could not reconcile the beers et al .",
    "distances with the available data .",
    "hence we caution against use of the calibrations of @xcite for metal - poor stars .",
    "we also point out that b12 wrongly ascribed to us and named after us a distance relation that is far shorter / fainter than anything we ever used , just to show that it is too faint .",
    "the trend of metallicity with altitude claimed by b12 is primarily driven by disc stars .",
    "the smaller trend for low metallicities that exclude those disc objects is identified as a selection bias : metal - poor stars are more luminous and in segue are more likely identified as brighter subgiant and turn - off stars in this sample .",
    "hence the metallicity has a spurious correlation with altitude via its dependence on distance . controlling for this effect , the altitude dependence of halo star metallicities vanishes .",
    "we identified an analogous problem for bhb stars and found a likely contamination with disc objects .",
    "the selection bias investigated in section [ sec : ddd ] is an excellent example of why forward modelling from theoretical models is needed and why measured distributions from observations in a non - volume complete sample are unreliable without a thorough analysis and correction of biases .",
    "the difference of proper motion distributions between retrograde stars and the remaining sample is not an argument that their data must be reliable , since stars with zero proper motions require extremely high line - of - sight velocities to be retrograde ( and a position near the galactic azimuth ) : retrograde stars essentially must show large proper motions .",
    "in fact , the contrast between  retrograde  ( as measured ) stars and the remaining population sharpens in proper motion space with decreasing sample quality .    furthermore , b12 used unphysical gaussian analysis on the azimuthal velocity distribution . as emphasized in sac11 ,",
    "such analysis is inappropriate as the observational error is highly non - gaussian and has long tails , especially towards the retrograde side .",
    "we demonstrated - now on the highly metal - poor stars - that we can easily fit it by an underlying gaussian distribution folded with the appropriate measurement errors .",
    "the b12 finding of a difference between the velocity distributions of bhb stars does not trace back to a different behaviour between metallicities as they argue , but to hot metal - poor bhb stars behaving differently from their less hot metal - poor counterparts .",
    "further checks do not reveal a reliable retrograde signal .",
    "further evidence in the literature is either subject to similar statistical and selection biases or not specific to the claim of a dual halo .",
    "for example , neither does the presence of increased substructure in the outskirts of the galactic halo ( which is a natural consequence of accretion and dynamic friction ) constitute an indication for a retrograde , metal - poor outer halo , nor does the theoretical possibility of a duality as suggested by some ( but far from all ) simulations act as any observational evidence .",
    "while we find no evidence for any chemokinematic halo duality in the segue sample , this disproof of evidence should not be misinterpreted as a proof of absence .",
    "even with bold extrapolation the sample does not allow investigations beyond a distance of roughly @xmath171 .",
    "further data and investigations especially with more remote samples , like the boss ( baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spectra , should be gathered to search for more subtle trends or trends beyond the current distance limits .",
    "we repeat our statement from sac11 that we favour a halo that shows an increase of substructure towards larger galactocentric radii and do not try to address the question if there is any metallicity gradient towards its outskirts beyond what is probed by segue .",
    "what we can definitely say is that there is no evidence from current segue data that would support the claims of c07 , c10 or b12 of a dual halo with a retrograde , highly metal - poor outer halo .",
