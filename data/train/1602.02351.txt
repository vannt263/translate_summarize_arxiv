    "after the cosmic recombination , hydrogen keeps the neutral state until first luminous objects such as stars and galaxies are formed . as the structure formation advances , neutral hydrogen begins to be ionized by the uv and x - ray photons escaped from galaxies .",
    "this epoch is called `` epoch of reionization '' .",
    "many theoretical works based on both numerical simulations and analytic models have investigated the time evolution and spatial structure of ionized bubbles in the eor @xcite .",
    "we can obtain the information on the physical state of the igm in the eor through the redshifted 21 cm line due to the hyperfine structure of neutral hydrogen @xcite .    however , the 21 cm signal from the eor has not been accessible yet .",
    "ongoing interferometers such as the murchison widefield array ( mwa)@xcite , the low frequency array ( lofar ) , and the precision array for probing the epoch of reionization ( paper ) @xcite have already started observations to detect the 21 cm signal statistically .",
    "in fact , the mwa and the paper have obtained upper limits on the 21 cm power spectrum ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the square kilometre array low ( ska - low ) , a future project of a low - frequency radio interferometer , will start observations in the near future @xcite and it will have enough sensitivity to image the 21cm - line signal at scales from several arcminutes to several degrees @xcite .    in order to understand the thermal and ionized state of the igm , the power spectrum has often been considered for the statistical analyses of the 21 cm brightness temperature fluctuations . for example , the typical bubble size could be probed through the `` shoulder '' of the 21 cm power spectrum @xcite .",
    "although the power spectrum is a powerful tool , the statistical properties of the 21cm - signal fluctuations are not perfectly described by the power spectrum , because they follow a highly non - gaussian distribution due to complicated ionizing processes .",
    "therefore , higher order statistics such as the bispectrum @xcite and trispectrum @xcite are required to evaluate the non - gaussianity .    the minkowski functionals ( mfs )",
    "are another tool to study the non - gaussianity . as the reionization process advances ,",
    "many ionized bubbles appear and these bubbles have typical topological structures in the brightness temperature field .",
    "the mfs are known to be useful to characterize this kind of topology . in the context of observational cosmology ,",
    "the mfs have been used to investigate the geometrical feature of galaxy distribution @xcite and to estimate the non - gaussianity appeared in the cmb temperature map @xcite .",
    "there have been several works to study the mfs and genus to characterize the topology of hi distribution in the eor .",
    "the topology varies with the evolution of ionization and the different stages of reionization could be distinguished by the mfs and genus @xcite .",
    "the topological property was utilized for suggesting a semi - numerical model which reproduces the mfs obtained from simulation with radiative transfer of ionizing photons @xcite , and for investigating dependency of hi topology on ionizing source property @xcite .",
    "in addition , the distribution of the 21 cm line brightness temperature has been studied by the 2d genus @xcite .",
    "then , the @xmath1 have been calculated with an assumption @xmath2 which is a suitable condition at the epoch where the spin temperature is sufficiently larger than the cmb temperature .",
    "they have found that genus curves depend on the ionized fraction , discriminate the scenarios with different ionizing efficiency values .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the 3-dimensional mfs of the 21 cm brightness temperature .",
    "the brightness temperature fluctuations consist of three components : fluctuations in the neutral fraction , spin temperature and matter density . in the previous works ,",
    "the mfs were calculated with an assumption that the spin - temperature fluctuations are negligible since the mean spin temperature is expected to be much larger than the cmb temperature as a result of x - ray heating .",
    "although this assumption is frequently used , it depends on the redshift and the property of x - ray sources .",
    "thus , first , we study the mfs of the three components and obtain an insight into the brightness temperature fluctuations .",
    "secondly , we investigate the redshift evolution of the mfs at the epoch from cosmic dawn through reionization . finally , to study the dependence of mfs on ionized bubble properties such as the size , shape and distribution",
    ", we calculate the mfs varying key model parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we explain the brightness temperature , semi - numerical simulation 21cmfast and our models . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the minkowski functionals .",
    "our main results are presented in section 4 .",
    "the summary and discussion will be given in section 5 . throughout this paper , we assume @xmath3 cosmology with ( @xmath4 ) = ( 0.31 , 0.69 , 0.048 , 68km / s / mpc , 0.97 , 0.82 ) @xcite .",
    "the observable quantity for the redshifted 21cm - line signal is the brightness temperature defined by the difference between the spin temperature and the cmb temperature @xcite , and can be written approximately as , @xmath5 , \\label{eq : brightness}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the hubble parameter , @xmath7 is the peculiar velocity , @xmath8 is the matter density parameter , @xmath9 is the baryon density parameter , @xmath10 is the hubble constant , @xmath11 is the neutral fraction , @xmath12 is the density contrast of matter , @xmath13 is the spin temperature and @xmath14 is the cmb temperature .",
    "the spin temperature evolves through coupling to the kinetic temperature of the igm by the wouthuysen - field ( wf ) effect @xcite and the cmb temperature . when the igm is heated sufficiently and the spin temperature becomes much higher than the cmb temperature , the factor ( 1-@xmath14/@xmath15 ) is saturated to become unity .",
    "therefore , the @xmath15 is often ignored at the late phase of the eor ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath1 are expressed by @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the spacial average of the brightness temperature .",
    "we make brightness temperature maps by a public semi - numerical code 21cmfast @xcite , setting a @xmath19 comoving box with @xmath20 cells . from the simulations ,",
    "not only brightness temperature maps but those of the neutral fraction @xmath11 , matter density @xmath12 and spin temperature @xmath15 can be obtained at each redshift .",
    "although the 21cmfast adopts some simplifying models for the calculations of the matter density distribution and radiative transfer @xcite , the resulting maps are reasonably consistent with those from more sophisticated numerical simulations at large scales ( @xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "the 21cmfast has three key parameters : ( 1 ) the ionizing efficiency ( @xmath22 ) which is a product of the fraction of gas converted into stars , the escape fraction and number of ionizing photon produced per stellar baryon @xcite , ( 2 ) the minimum virial temperature of halos which host galaxies ( @xmath23 ) and ( 3 ) the number of x - ray photons emitted from sources per solar mass ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we take ( @xmath25 ) = ( @xmath26 ) as our fiducial model ( hereafter `` fid '' model ) , with which the reionization is completed at @xmath27 as indicated from observations of high-@xmath28 quasar spectra @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath29 $ ] corresponds to the criterion of the effectiveness of the atomic cooling .",
    "below this temperature , the atomic cooling is ineffective and the molecular cooling due to the oscillation and rotation of molecular hydrogens becomes the main cooling process .",
    "however , if radiative feedback processes such as photodissociation are effective , molecular hydrogens are destroyed and star formation in halos is suppressed @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath23 parametrizes the effectiveness of radiative feedback processes . the evolution of the neutral fraction ( @xmath11 ) and the spin temperature for the `` fid '' model is shown in fig .  [ xhts ] .    to understand the mfs of the brightness temperature , we prepare three kinds of brightness temperature maps .    * component map `` @xmath30 '' : only the spin temperature fluctuations are taken into account , ignoring the fluctuations in @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",

    "component map `` @xmath34 '' : only the fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen fraction are taken into account and we set @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the mfs calculated from these three maps represent the structure of the components which contribute to the brightness temperature fluctuations . in section [ subsec : comp ] , we compare the mfs of these maps with that of the full brightness temperature .     and @xmath15 for our `` fid '' model . the cmb temperature @xmath14 is also shown for reference .",
    ", width=302 ]    below , we will see the dependence of the mfs on the model parameters . here",
    "we focus on two parameters , @xmath22 and @xmath23 because the topology of ionized bubbles is expected to be affected significantly by these parameters @xcite .",
    "we can extract topological information on an arbitrary scalar function @xmath37(@xmath38 ) distributed in 3d space via the mfs .",

    "for instance , a sphere has @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) and a torus has @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) . in general , when the @xmath57 is positive , there are a lot of isolated excursion sets .",
    "negative value of @xmath57 , on the other hand , indicates that the excursion set has a multi - connected structure .",
    "the calculation method of the mfs is shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when @xmath65 has a gaussian distribution , the mfs can be written analytically and have symmetric shapes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaus ] .",
    "we can see that the @xmath57 has two positive peaks and a valley at center of @xmath47 which corresponds to the average value of @xmath65 .",
    "these two peaks reflect the symmetric probability distribution function of the gaussian distribution with the same number of isolated regions which have positive and negative values . for a non - gaussian distribution ,",
    "this symmetry is broken .",
    "when the non - gaussinaity is weak , the mfs can be described analytically @xcite . as we will see below , the mfs of the @xmath1 are significantly different from those of the gaussian case because the @xmath1 follows a highly non - gaussian distribution .",
    "we use @xmath65 of the brightness temperature maps smoothed by a gaussian kernel which is expressed by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a smoothing scale . throughout this paper , we set @xmath68 .",
    "actually , the shapes of mfs are dependent on the smoothing scale , but we found the dependence is not so large for @xmath69",
    ". the angular resolution of the ska1-low will be @xmath70 , which corresponds to @xmath71 , at @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , the fwhm depends on the frequency ( redshift ) .",
    "for example , the resolution at which the ska1-low has the best sensitivity becomes twice for @xmath73 .",
    "note that an ionized bubble with a radius smaller than the smoothing scale @xmath67 is erased by the smoothing effect .",
    "therefore , although the brightness temperature at ionized regions should be zero , this does not become precisely zero if we perform the smoothing with a smoothing scale larger than them .",
    "we call this region `` unresolved ionized '' region .",
    "the 21 cm brightness temperature is expected to follow a non - gaussian distribution due to highly - nonlinear astrophysical effects .",

    "however , the @xmath57 at this redshift has an asymmetry due to the spin temperature fluctuations .",

    "as x - ray heating progresses , the mfs shift from low to high values of @xmath1 and change their shapes .",

    ", the @xmath55 has a long tail on the right .",

    "concerning the @xmath57 , the peak on the right has a long tail which indicates that small heated regions are isolated .",
    "another peak on the left represents the existence of isolated cold regions .",
    "however , this peak becomes smaller as heating progresses .",
    "this is because x - ray photons have a long mean free path and the heating effect is not limited to the neighborhood of the sources .",
    "second , let us see the transition stage . in fig .",
    "[ evolution2 ] , we show the mfs in this stage .",
    "although the average value of @xmath1 is positive at this stage , a small fraction of pixels has a negative @xmath1 ( @xmath97 ) at @xmath98 and 12.46 , while @xmath1 becomes positive at all pixels at later redshifts . at @xmath98 ,",
    "the @xmath54 is 0.5 at @xmath81 , which means that the number of hot regions ( @xmath99 ) and cold regions ( @xmath100 ) are almost the same , while the @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 have a nearly gaussian shape . at later redshifts , the center of the mfs shift to larger values of @xmath1 and",
    "a tail extends to the left , which indicates the non - gaussianity is increasing .",
    "finally , we consider the reionization stage .",
    "the mfs at this stage are shown in fig .",
    "[ evolution1 ] .",
    "the @xmath101 decreases sharply at @xmath81 because of the presence of ionized bubbles where @xmath81 .",
    "however , as we can see , the rapid drop is relaxed due to the smoothing , especially when the bubble sizes are smaller than or comparable to the smoothing scale .",
    "this feature is typical of the @xmath54 during the late phase of reionization .",
    "on the other hand , the peaks in the @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 shift toward low - temperature direction as reionization proceeds .",
    "this is because reionization starts from high - density regions , where the brightness temperature is also high , so that highest-@xmath1 regions are abruptly transformed into lowest-@xmath1 regions .",
    "this drastic change in the distribution of brightness temperature leads to the highly - nongaussian shape of the mfs .",
    "let us note on the behavior of the @xmath57 at the reionization stage .",
    "a peak can be seen around @xmath81 at @xmath86 , but it disappears and the @xmath57 becomes negative at later time .",
    "this implies that ionized regions are isolated at @xmath86 and have merged by @xmath102 .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the fact that the average neutral fraction decrease from 0.62 to 0.38 during this epoch .",
    "the evolution of mfs before reionization has not been investigated so far and previous works have not studied the evolution of the @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 even during the eor .",
    "our results of @xmath57 at reionization stage are consistent with those of previous works @xcite",
    ". however , the resolution and volume of their simulation maps are smaller than ours . therefore , our results are complementary to other works .",
    "we note that the evolution of the mfs is based on a specific choice of reionization model with a plausible reionization and heating history .",
    "the distribution of ionized bubbles and topological structure of brightness temperature are sensitive to the value of @xmath23 and @xmath103 . in this section , we see the dependence of the mfs on these parameters . the dependence of the mfs on ionizing source properties has been discussed in previous works .",
    "for example , @xcite has focused on the @xmath57 for the ionized fraction field rather than the @xmath1 field . on the other hand",

    "[ maptvir ] , we show @xmath1 maps with different combinations of @xmath23 and @xmath103 , fixing the average neutral fraction to @xmath104 at @xmath105 .",
    "for the two simulations , we used the same initial condition of matter density fluctuations . as we can see , a lower @xmath23 results in a larger number of ionizing sources and then ionized bubbles .",
    "on the other hand , some of the ionized bubbles are connected for the high-@xmath23 model because the ionizing efficiency is higher for this model , while the number of ionizing sources is smaller .    in fig .",
    "[ tvir ] , we compare the mfs of four models with a different combination of @xmath23 and @xmath103 , again fixing the average neutral fraction to @xmath104 at @xmath105 . because ionizing sources exist only in densest regions for the model with a high @xmath23 , relatively dense regions which do not have ionizing sources remain neutral and have higher values of dtb .",
    "although the neutral fraction is fixed , the decrease in the @xmath101 at @xmath106 is not the same for the four models .",
    "this is due to the effect of smoothing , which is more significant for a model with a low @xmath23 which leads to a larger number of small bubbles .",
    "a valley of the @xmath56 located at a low @xmath1 value represents the property of smoothed ionized bubbles .",
    "it becomes deep as @xmath23 decreases because small bubbles have higher curvature which results in a large absolute value of the @xmath56 .",
    "concerning the @xmath57 , the peak around @xmath107 becomes noticeable as @xmath23 decreases , which implies that isolated ionized bubbles are more abundant for a lower value of @xmath23 .",
    "in this work , we investigated the topological structure of the 21cm - line brightness temperature field during and before the eor by using the minkowski functionals .",
    "firstly , we compared the mfs of our fiducial model with those of the component maps and found that the main component of the topological structure is the neutral fraction during the eor and the spin temperature before the eor .",
    "further , the spin temperature can contribute to the structure of @xmath1 even though the average spin temperature is three times higher than @xmath14 .",
    "secondly , we studied the evolution of the mfs considering three stages .",
    "the evolution in the heating stage is explained by expansion of x - ray - heated regions . in the transition stage , small ionized bubbles and disappearance of cold gas change the structure of @xmath1 .",
    "the complicated evolution in the reionization stage is understood as the expansion and merger of ionized bubbles .",
    "thirdly , the variation of the mfs changing the values of @xmath23 and @xmath103 was investigated .",
    "we found that these parameters , even if the average neutral fraction is fixed , affect the topological structure of the igm and we interpreted the variation of the mfs .",
