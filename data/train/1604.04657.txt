    "the douglas  rachford algorithm ( dra ) was first introduced in @xcite as an operator splitting technique to solve partial differential equations arising in heat conduction . as a result of findings by lions and mercier @xcite in the monotone operator setting",
    ", the method has been extended to find solutions of the sum of two maximally monotone operators . when specialized to normal cone operators , the method is very useful in solving feasibility problems . to fix our setting , we assume throughout that    equation    i.e , a finite - dimensional real hilbert space with inner product @xmath0 and induced norm @xmath1 . given closed subsets @xmath2 and @xmath3 of @xmath4 with nonempty intersection , we consider the fundamental feasibility problem    equation [ e : prob ]    which frequently arises in science and engineering applications . a common approach for solving is to use projection algorithms that employ projectors onto the underlying sets ; see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein . among those algorithms , the douglas",
    " rachford algorithm applied to has attracted much attention ; see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite and the references therein for further information .    in the convex case",
    ", it is known , see , e.g. , lions and mercier @xcite and svaiter @xcite , that the sequence generated by the dra always converges while the `` shadow sequence '' converges to a point of the intersection .",
    "even when the convex feasibility problem is inconsistent , i.e. , @xmath5 , it was shown in @xcite that the `` shadow sequence '' is bounded and its cluster points solve a best approximation problem ; the entire sequence converges if one of the sets is an affine subspace @xcite .",
    "although the douglas  rachford algorithm has been applied successfully to various problems involving one or more nonconvex sets , the theoretical justification is far from complete .",
    "recently , in the case of a euclidean sphere and a line , borwein and sims @xcite have proved local convergence of the dra at points of the intersection , while aragn artacho and borwein @xcite have given a region of convergence for this model in the plane ; moreover , benoist @xcite has even shown that the dra sequence converges in norm to a point of the intersection except when the starting point belongs to the hyperplane of symmetry . in another direction , @xcite proved local convergence for finite unions of convex sets .",
    "on the convergence rate , it has been shown by hesse , luke and neumann @xcite that the dra for two subspaces converges linearly . furthermore , the rate is then actually the cosine of the friedrichs angle between the subspaces @xcite . in the potentially nonconvex case , under transversality assumptions , hesse and luke @xcite proved local linear convergence of the dra for a superregular set and an affine subspace , while phan @xcite obtained such a rate for two super - regular sets .",
    "specialized to the convex setting , the result in @xcite implies linear convergence of the dra for two convex sets whose the relative interiors have a nonempty intersection ; see also @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the linear convergence of the dra may fail even for simple settings in the euclidean plane , as shown in @xcite .",
    "based on hlder regularity properties , borwein , li , and tam @xcite established sublinear convergence for two convex basic semi - algebraic sets . for the linear convergence of the dra in the framework of optimization problems involving a sum of two functions , we refer the reader to , e.g. , giselsson s @xcite , @xcite , li and pong @xcite , liang , faili , peyr , and luke @xcite , patrinos , stella , and bemporad s @xcite , and the references therein .    davis and",
    "yin @xcite observed that the dra may converge arbitrarily slowly in infinite dimensions ; however , in finite dimensions , it often works extremely well .",
    "very recently , the globally finite convergence of the dra has been shown in @xcite for an affine subspace and a locally polyhedral set , or for a hyperplane and an epigraph , and then by aragn artacho , borwein , and tam @xcite for a finite set and a halfspace .    _",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide various finite - convergence results . _",
    "the sufficient conditions we present are new and complementary to existing conditions .    after presenting useful results on projectors and the dra ( section  [ s : aux ] ) and on locally identical sets ( section  [ s : lis ] ) ,",
    "we specifically derive results related to the following five scenarios :    * @xmath2 is a halfspace and @xmath3 is an epigraph of a convex function ; @xmath2 is either a hyperplane or a halfspace , and @xmath3 is a halfspace ( see section  [ s:4 ] ) . * @xmath2 and @xmath3 are supersets or modifications of other sets where the dra is better understood ( see section  [ s : expand ] ) .",

    "* @xmath2 is an affine subspace and @xmath3 is a polyhedron in the absence of slater s condition ( see section  [ s:8 ] ) .",
