    "this work deals with a class of superintegrable hamiltonians systems , in the framework of the schrdinger equation of quantum mechanics , and its connections with the factorization method . we will restrict ourselves to a particular case where the underlying symmetry is the lie algebra @xmath5 , but its main features can be directly implemented to higher dimensional systems .    the main objective of this study is to show a natural extension to higher dimensional spaces of the intertwining ( or darboux ) transformations from a well known class of one - dimensional factorized systems . in fact , we want to set the higher rank @xmath6-systems corresponding to those having as dynamical algebra the lie algebra of rank one @xmath7 .",
    "we will show in detail that the application of procedures familiar in one dimension to a concrete two - dimensional system will lead us to a wide set of operators closing a dynamical lie algebra .",
    "we also consider discrete symmetry operators quite important to perform equivalences .",
    "all these operators connect eigenstates that can be drawn as points in a three - dimensional lattice giving rise to polyhedrons representing degenerate series of @xmath5 irreducible representations .",
    "each of these series corresponds to the same energy and can be embedded in just one representation of the lie algebra @xmath0 .",
    "the notion of superpotential will also be re - examined inside the higher rank formalism .",
    "thus , the usual procedure to look for solutions with separable variables can be better appreciated under this point of view .",
    "thus , we try to implement the program of generalization of the factorizable one - dimensional systems involving lie algebras of rank one as dynamical algebras , as can be seen , for instance , in the classical paper by infeld and hull @xcite .",
    "we also hope that this work will be useful when dealing with other integrable systems , but not necessarily maximally integrable , for instance not enjoing for such a wealth of factorizations , or even not having a system of separable variables , but still allowing for algebraic methods @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  [ su3hamiltoniansystem ]",
    "we will introduce a two - dimensional superintegrable system and find some separable solutions by standard procedures .",
    "although these polynomial solutions are known and can be found in other references , this will serve us to recall some aspects of the usual factorization technique and to precise the operators of the lie algebra @xmath7 related with the lie algebra @xmath8 , and their support spaces .",
    "next , in section  [ dynamicalsymmetries ] , we will look for other sets of intertwining operators , corresponding to the lie algebras @xmath5 and @xmath0 , taking also into account discrete symmetries .",
    "we characterize the eigenfunctions belonging to irreducible representations that will be depicted as the points on octahedrons and the interpretation of some of its planar sections .",
    "the analog of the superpotentials and their relation with certain types of solutions will be considered in section  [ egeinstatesandfactorizations ] . some conclusions and perspective for future work will close the paper .",

    "we make use of the standard notation @xmath53 for an @xmath54-eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath55 , inside the ` @xmath56-representation ' .",
    "now , we can identify the eigenstates of the hamiltonians @xmath57 in terms of representation vectors @xmath53 .",

    "we would prefer a larger dynamical algebra with a simpler correspondence , i.e. , such that only one of its iur s gives all the eigenstates with the same energy in the hierarchy .    in order to build up a dynamical algebra having these properties ,",

    "if we allow to act with the @xmath8 generators on an hamiltonian @xmath83 we will get a two - dimensional parameter lattice of hamiltonians which constitute a @xmath8-hierarchy fixed by the initial values @xmath82 : @xmath98 , @xmath99 . each energy level of this hamiltonian hierarchy is degenerated and the eigenstates belong to @xmath8-representations .",
    "let us concentrate on the hierarchies associated to iur s of @xmath8 .",

    "but we can not get rid of this multiplicity unless we enlarge the ambient space .",
    "another natural question is whether there are other intertwining shape - invariant operators inside the @xmath8-hierarchy .",

    "moreover , taking the hermitian conjugate we have made use of the invariant measure on the sphere . if we write the hamiltonians in the hierarchy displaying the kinetic ( or free ) part and the potential as @xmath239 we see that the vector fields originate the kinetic term , i.e. @xmath240 and the components @xmath236 ( defined on the sphere ) give rise to the potential @xmath241 , labelled by the parameters @xmath242 . substituting ( [ fields ] ) in the hamiltonian ( [ esp ] ) and taking into account ( [ cas ] ) , we get the expression [ cua ] v_(_1,_2 ) = ( _ ) ^2 + ( a^+ _ ) + ( _ ) ^2 + ( b^+ _ ) + ( _ ) ^2 + ( c^+ _ ) + _where @xmath243 is a number depending on @xmath244 . equation ( [ cua ] ) can be considered as a nonlinear partial differential equation linking the unknowns @xmath245 with the potential , in a quite similar way to the riccati equation for the superpotential @xmath246 in the one - dimensional schrdinger equation . for this reason , we sometimes will refer to @xmath245 as superpotential functions .",
    "this is in agreement with a more general result @xcite where the first order intertwining is built by ` dressing ' the symmetries of the laplacian operator with certain functions .    the basic property of the one - dimensional superpotential @xmath246 was that it could be considered as the logarithmic derivative of a hamiltonian eigenstate ( see ( [ sp1 ] ) ) .",
    "here , we have something similar with respect to the superpotentials @xmath245 but first we want to settle this problem in general terms .",

    "this is in sharp contrast with ordinary first order differential operators where the kernel is one - dimensional .",
    "another option we have at hand is the following . the intertwining relation ( [ twin ] ) implies the commutation @xmath250 this means that we can look for eigenfunctions of @xmath229 inside any eigenfunction space of @xmath251 , not necessarily that one annihilated by @xmath231 , as was the case just considered above . in this case , however , a similar expression to ( [ sp1 ] ) in terms of such eigenfunctions is no longer valid for @xmath246 .",

    "this allows us to set @xmath256 from this equation we can also separate variables in @xmath173 . so that , the eigenfunction equation @xmath257 leads to a second order ordinary differential equation",
    "whose solution can be easily obtained .",
    "+ however , we must outline that in this case the remaining superpotential functions @xmath258 have not a simultaneous expression ( [ spf ] ) in terms of the same @xmath173 , they need different eigenfunctions . under this point of view",
    ", section  [ su3hamiltoniansystem ] constitutes an illustration of how this option leads to eigenfunctions separated in the variables @xmath235 . *",
    "_ other excited eigenstates . _",
    "the second option is to solve , for instance , the eigenvalue problem @xmath259 , requiring at the same time @xmath173 to be also a hamiltonian eigenfunction . in terms of the ambient coordinates @xmath260 this equation is ( see also @xcite ) @xmath261 the same procedure can be applied with other more general sets of operators commuting with the hamiltonian .",
    "for instance , we can diagonalize @xmath161 inside the subspace @xmath262 where the @xmath263 s are constant coefficients .",

    "for instance , the classification of the irreducible representations of @xmath158 in series corresponding to @xmath0-octahedrons , and the relations involved in this framework is a non trivial result that could be best appreciated inside the intertwining technique .",
    "the relation of the unitary representations with an special form of the superpotential functions , or the separable eigensolutions determined in terms of intertwining operators clarifies some of the known procedures .",
    "we have seen how the elements of one - dimensional factorizations must be adapted to the new context .",
    "for example , the relation of superpotentials and a whole class of eigenfunctions ( not just one ) , the expression of the hamiltonian operator is not just a simple factorization , the lattice of states must be drawn in a three - dimensional space , etc .",
    "there are several problems that can be adressed using the present procedure .",
    "the systems underlying noncompact algebras @xmath264 , inhomogeneous lie algebras @xmath265 and contracted algebras @xcite are among the first applications that we expect to report in a near future .",
