    "the quantum point contact completely pinched off , the mesoscopic capacitor has a discrete energy spectrum with typical level spacing @xmath4 , which is much larger than typical temperatures , and @xmath5 is the time it takes to make a full round trip inside the capacitor .    with the quantum point contact being open , the electronic states of the capacitor below the fermi level of the external electron reservoir are filled .",
    "next , we consider the situation where a step - like gate voltage @xmath6 periodically shifts the highest occupied level above and below the fermi level of the reservoir , fig .",

    "the period of the voltage variations @xmath7 is much longer than @xmath8 and the amplitude @xmath9 is on the order of the level spacing , @xmath10 .",

    "when operated in this manner , the system produces no dc - current , since every electron emission from the mesoscopic capacitor is followed by emission of a hole into the out - going edge state ( when an electron is absorbed from the in - going edge state by the mesoscopic capacitor , a hole is in turn created in the out - going edge state ) .",

    "the system is treated as being fully phase coherent and all quantum effects are appropriately accounted for . however , as well shall see , a simple semi - classical description of the mesoscopic capacitor is equally capable of explaining the measured current and noise properties .",
    "this model was first suggested by mah _",

    "the inverse noise measurement frequency was roughly equal to the driving frequency and both were much longer than the round trip time , @xmath30 @xcite .",
