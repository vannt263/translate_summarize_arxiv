    "in our previous study @xcite , we showed that prediscovery photometry of ugc  2773-ot showed a slow and steady brightening in the 5  yr prior , when it was 3 or more magnitudes brighter than its quiescent progenitor detected a decade before discovery in _ hst _ images ( the prediscovery brightening is reproduced in figure  [ fig : phot ] ) .",
    "as noted earlier @xcite , the _ hst _ data for the progenitor correspond to a star of at least @xmath220 m@xmath9 and log(@xmath10/l@xmath9 ) = 5.1 .",
    "those authors both noted , however , that these estimates for the progenitor are likely to be just lower limits because with a small amount of circumstellar dust extinction ( motivated by the early ir excess ) , the progenitor could easily be hotter and more luminous , corresponding to a 4060 m@xmath9 star or more .",
    "thus , the slow brightening in the years before discovery could have been partially due to colour evolution from a hot to a cooler state , in addition to a real increase in bolometric luminosity .",
    "unfortunately , information about the prediscovery colour evolution is not available aside from the single _ hst _ epoch .",
    "since reaching its peak apparent brightness around day 200 ( as plotted in figure  [ fig : phot ] ) until day @xmath22000 , ugc  2773-ot has had a very slow and steady decline rate at visible wavelengths .",
    "there may be small fluctuations in brightness , but the overall trend appears smooth . from the kait light curve , we measure an average decline rate of 0.26 mag yr@xmath3 during the first @xmath22000 days .",
    "there is very little colour evolution during this slow decline , and the trend is toward slightly bluer colours at late times . in the inset of figure  [ fig : phot1 ] , we show the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for early times around days 2040 , as well as late times around day 2000 .",
    "the early - time photometry include ir @xmath11 magnitudes from our previous study @xcite and @xmath12 magnitudes from @xcite taken at the same epoch , both dereddened by @xmath13=0.56 mag .",
    "the optical / ir sed at early times can be approximated with a @xmath26500  k blackbody , which is consistent with our low - resolution spectrum on day 34 shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] . at later times , the sed indicates a slightly warmer temperature , but as we discussed below , this is mostly due to a combination of a continuum photosphere at about the same temperature , plus a blue excess from emission lines .",
    "neither early nor late epochs show a substantial ir excess . at early times , one could deduce a small near - ir excess by choosing a slightly warmer characteristic temperature for optical data plus a small amount of hot dust to match the ir fluxes @xcite .",
    "at late epochs , the @xmath14 and @xmath15 magnitudes are consistent with an extension of the optical blackbody , but there does appear to be a small @xmath16-band excess",
    ". this may be due to the formation of new dust , cooling of csm dust heated by an ir echo , or the destruction of the hottest dust seen previously , leaving the cooler dust at larger radii .",
    "continued monitoring of the ir fluxes may be interesting ; if ugc2773-ot fades as @xmath0  carinae did at the end of its decade - long plateau , we may see a strong increase in the ir excess .",
    "although there has been only gradual change in the light curve of ugc  2773-ot over the past few years , there have been some pronounced changes in its spectrum , as discussed next .",
    "as compared to the ews for the ca  ii ir triplet and he  i @xmath75876 .",
    "h@xmath4 ( black filled points ) was integrated from roughly @xmath11200 to @xmath171800 km s@xmath3 , and the uncertainty is dominated by signal to noise of the continuum . for ca  ii ( orange unfilled squares , connected by orange lines ) , we took the integrated ew of all 3 lines , and so p cygni absorption at some epochs weakens the emission ew .",
    "the relatively wide continuum also raises the ew uncertainty due to the choice of the continuum level . for he  i @xmath75876 ( blue squares and arrows )",
    "we have only upper limits at early times determined by the signal to noise ratio of the spectra , whereas we clearly detect narrow he   i at later times , although at those epochs we sometimes also see an accompanying p cygni absorption that adds to uncertainty in choosing a continuum level .",
    "( we did not use the day 1559 spectrum , which suffered from calibration problems due to weather . )",
    "the he  i ew is multipled by a factor of 40 for display.,width=288 ]      in our previously reported day 34 spectrum @xcite obtained shortly after discovery and near the time of peak luminosity , ugc  2773-ot showed a cool absorption - line spectrum , similar to late f - type of g - type supergiants , and similar in some ways to the spectra of lbvs in their cool state .",
    "@xcite presented similar spectra of ugc  2773-ot obtained around the same epoch .",
    "the early spectrum was characterised by heavy line blanketing by numerous narrow absorption lines in the blue , and relatively weak and narrow h@xmath4 emission .",
    "an echelle spectrum taken with keck / hires on day 22 showed a clear p cygni profile in h@xmath4 that suggested outflow speeds around 360 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the early spectrum showed strong absorption from ca  ii h and k , very weak emission in the forbidden [ ca  ii ] doublet , and a relatively weak p cygni profile in the ca  ii ir triplet @xcite .",
    "these are similar to the spectral properties seen in sn  2008s - like objects @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite showed that our day 34 spectrum of ugc  2773-ot resembled spectra of light echoes from @xmath0  carinae , also thought to correspond to early phases in its historical giant lbv eruption near peak .    in the intervening @xmath26",
    "yr , the spectrum of ugc  2773-ot has shown gradual and subtle changes as the source faded slowly .",
    "the overall spectral evolution is shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "while the visible / red continuum slope has remained roughly constant at a characteristic apparent temperature around 6500  k , there are a number of other changes reminiscent of increasing temperature / ionization or dropping optical depth .",
    "the forest of narrow absorption lines that cause strong line blanketing in the blue ( day 34 ) weakened considerably , and many narrow features including numerous fe  ii lines change into emission rather than absorption ; this is discussed more below .",
    "we see weakening and disappearing p cygni absorption features , and strengthening with time of emission components of balmer lines and the ca  ii triplet .",
    "later epochs even show narrow he  i in emission , which is absent at early epochs .",
    "one of the most pronounced changes is seen in the h@xmath4 profile , which becomes stronger , broader , and develops an asymmetric and irregular profile ( figure  [ fig : halpha ] ) .",
    "implications of the h@xmath4 profile are discussed later .",
    "car @xcite . ]",
    "an interesting comparison involves the relative strengths of h@xmath4 , the ca  ii ir triplet , and he  i @xmath75876 .",
    "the time dependence of equivalent widths ( ews ) for these three lines is plotted in figure  [ fig : ew ] .",
    "while the light curve shows only gradual fading of about 1.5 mag ( a factor of 4 ) in @xmath22000 days , the h@xmath4 ew climbs by a factor of @xmath2150 or more , so these changes in ew also trace changes in line luminosity .",
    "ew we measure is actually due to narrow h@xmath4 and [ n  ii ] from an unresolved h  ii region , whereas the h  ii region contributes a much lower fraction at late times because the broad component has strengthened .",
    "the true relative increase in h@xmath4 strength is therefore even larger than indicated in figure  [ fig : ew ] by another factor of 2@xmath13 . ]",
    "underscoring the unusual changes to h@xmath4 , the h@xmath6 line does not show a similar evolution in terms of its profile shape or relative strength . on day 34 ,",
    "the h@xmath4/h@xmath6 flux ratio is 7.7@xmath181 ( not corrected for any local reddening ) , and the h@xmath4/h@xmath6 flux ratio then climbs to 31@xmath182 by day 1057 .",
    "this indicates that h@xmath6 does not increase in strength as much as h@xmath4 , probably signifying a growing contribution from shock excitation at later times .",
    "this increasing h@xmath4/h@xmath6 ratio is not due to increased reddening from dust , since the continuum shows basically no change in slope , while h@xmath4 develops a line profile that is very different from h@xmath6 .",
    "also , the profile of h@xmath6 retains its p cyg absorption , whereas h@xmath4 goes fully into emission with an asymmetric profile . interestingly , though , the speed of the h@xmath6 p cygni trough increases from around 300 km s@xmath3 on day 34 to about 700800 km s@xmath3 by day 1836 ( figure  [ fig : hbeta ] ) .",
    "an important point is that at each epoch , the blue p cygni absorption in h@xmath6 is at a similar speed to the blue emission bump seen in h@xmath4 .",
    "thus , both h@xmath6 and h@xmath4 trace a dramatic increase in outflow speed with time during the event .",
    "if the outflow speed is increasing with time , the fast material must catch up with and overtake the slower material ejected earlier , indicating that shocks should play an important role in the event .",
    "this is discussed more below .",
    "the ew of the ca  ii ir triplet increases in - step with h@xmath4 for the first 1000 days , but while h@xmath4 levels off for the next 1000 days , ca  ii fades by more than a factor of 3 . at around the same time",
    ", he  i @xmath75876 transitions from nondetection in the first 1000 days , to then rising as ca  ii falls ( note that the he  i ew is multiplied by a factor of 40 for display in figure  [ fig : ew ] ) .",
    "thus , the changes after day 1000 likely indicate a rise in ionization and electron temperature ( especially he  i emission , but also ca@xmath19 getting partly ionized to ca@xmath20 ) that accompanies a falling optical depth .",
    "the likely physical significance of these changes is discussed below in section 4.1 .",
    "the top panel shows the [ ca  ii ] @xmath87291,7324 doublet on days 34 ( black ) and 1836 ( orange ) , while the bottom panel shows the same two dates for the ca  ii ir triplet at 8498 , 8542 , and 8662  .",
    "both sets of lines show an increase in strength , and the p cygni absorption of the ca  ii ir triplet shows an unambiguous increase in velocity .",
    "the inset in the upper right shows the line profile shapes as a function of rest - frame velocity for [ ca   ii ] @xmath87291 ( blue ) and ca  ii @xmath78662 ( black).,width=288 ]    the behavior of the red / ir lines of ca@xmath19 are particularly interesting , and are relevant to comparisons with other types of sn impostors and @xmath0  car .",
    "figure  [ fig : ca2 ] illustrates the changes in line intensity and profile shape with time .",
    "this figure shows the day 34 ( near peak ) and day 1836 spectra of the [ ca  ii ] @xmath87291,7324 doublet and the ca  ii ir triplet at 8498 , 8542 , and 8662  .",
    "both sets of lines increase in strength ( in accord with figure  [ fig : ew ] ) , but the increase in [ ca  ii ] emission flux is more dramatic because these lines were very weak on day 34 .",
    "this increase is similar to the increase in [ ca  ii ] emission strength seen in light echoes of @xmath0 car as it faded @xcite .",
    "the velocity profiles of the lines also change markedly between the two epochs .",
    "the [ ca  ii ] lines develop a boxy or even double - peaked profile , with a fwhm of 821(@xmath185 ) km s@xmath3 , and with the line wings dropping steeply to the continuum level at @xmath1530 ( @xmath1815 ) and + 530 ( @xmath1815 ) km s@xmath3 .",
    "thus , the emission is narrower than the broad asymmetric emission profile of h@xmath4 at late epochs ( figure  [ fig : halpha ] ) .",
    "the ca  ii ir triplet lines show the same boxy emission profile with almost exactly the same width ( see the inset in figure  [ fig : ca2 ] ) , but the tops of the profiles are skewed to the red , presumably because of some blueshifted self - absorption that diminishes the blue peak .",
    "the ca  ii ir triplet lines also have blueshifted p cygni absorption components , with the velocity of the absorption trough minimum increasing dramatically from @xmath1350 ( @xmath1830 ) km s@xmath3 on day 34 to @xmath1800 ( @xmath1820 ) km s@xmath3 on day 1836 . the velocity of the ca   ii p cygni absorption is therefore similar to the speed of the blue bump in the h@xmath4 emission profile at late times .",
    "the ca@xmath17 emission components do not trace this faster material , and therefore originate from a different zone in the outflow ; this may be relevant for interpretations of the [ ca  ii ] emission in other sn impostors , like the sn  2008s - like objects mentioned in the introduction , as well as the [ ca  ii ] emission seen in light echoes of @xmath0 carinae , which have been compared to ugc  2773-ot @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the outflow is discussed below in section 4.2 .",
    "while the light curve of ugc  2773-ot shows a very gradual rate of fading , there are interesting spectroscopic changes over the past 6 years that hold important clues about the physical processes in the eruption .",
    "overall , the observed spectrum held an almost constant continuum temperature at 6500  k while fading about 1.5 mag in visible light . despite",
    "the unchanging observed continuum slope , there are signs of increasing ionization and excitation that seem inconsistent with this relatively low and constant apparent continuum temperature .",
    "the early time spectra around peak apparent brightness are qualitatively consistent with expectations for either a cool optically thick wind , or a photosphere that is formed in the expanding ejecta of an explosion . as time proceeds , however , we begin to see clear signs that a strong shock wave is contributing to the spectrum .",
    "this spectral evolution therefore gets to the crux of a key current question regarding lbv eruptions ( see @xcite ) : are they driven by super - eddington winds or hydrodynamic explosions ? while we can not claim from available evidence that a super - eddington wind @xcite plays no role in lifting material from the star ( in fact it may help produce the csm into which the explosion crashes ) , there are several lines of evidence that point to or require strong shock excitation as playing a key role in powering the event , especially at later times .",
    "these are :    \\1 . in the past 6 years",
    ", h@xmath4 has increased sharply in ew and line luminosity in ugc  2773-ot , as seen in the normal evolution of sne  iin powered largely or entirely by csm interaction .",
    "also , the h@xmath4/h@xmath6 ratio increases as the h@xmath4 luminosity climbs . this increasing flux ratio favours collisional excitation in a shock rather than photoionization and recombination as the power source for the strong h@xmath4 emission . again , late - time spectra of sne  iin exhibit very strong h@xmath4 , often with little else detected in their visible - wavelength spectra .    \\2 .",
    "the ew and line flux of he  i @xmath75876 strengthens after day 1000 , even though the apparent continuum temperature changes little .",
    "a 6500  k photosphere can not photoionize a substantial fraction of the he to produce he  i recombination emission .",
    "this requires an additional source of high excitation .",
    "interestingly , the ca  ii ir triplet weakens as the he  i @xmath75876 ew strengthens , while h@xmath4 remains strong after day 1000 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew ] ) .",
    "this again suggests an increase in ionization from ca@xmath19 to ca@xmath20 .",
    "a significant change in ionization is not expected for photoexcitation alone if the apparent continuum temperature is unchanged .",
    "he  i @xmath75876 emission generally would require temperatures above 20,000  k. the excess ionization is likely due to x - rays and far - uv radiation from a shock .",
    "characteristic outflow speeds are increasing with time , as seen in the increased width of the h@xmath4 emission profile as well as the increasing speed of the blueshifted p cygni absorption trough of h@xmath6 ( from about 300 to 800 km s@xmath3 ) and ca  ii .",
    "if the outflow speed is increasing , one expects that fast ejecta must catch up with slow material ejected previously , giving rise to a shock .",
    "the blue portion of the visible spectrum changed from a forest of narrow absorption lines at early times indicative of the strong line - blanketing seen in dense winds and cooling ejecta ( day 34 ) to an excess of blue emission lines at later epochs .",
    "figure  [ fig : blue ] directly compares the day 34 spectrum with strong blue line blanketing to the day 1836 spectrum with excess blue emission , with both spectra normalised to the red continuum level .",
    "while their red spectra are very similar ( except for the strength of h@xmath4 and a few other individual lines ) , the spectra at these two epochs are very different in the blue . to isolate the _ excess _ blue emission",
    ", the bottom panel in figure  [ fig : blue ] shows a spectrum of the residual after subtracting the day 34 spectrum from the later day 1836 spectrum .",
    "the residual represents the extra emission that appears at late times .",
    "this residual emission is shown in gray , while the black tracing is a smoothed version of this same residual spectrum .",
    "this residual blue emission has a spectral morphology that is very reminiscent of the `` blue pseudo continuum '' that is often seen in sne  ibn and sne iin that are powered by strong csm interaction .",
    "figure  [ fig : blue ] also shows the late - time ( day 905 ) spectrum of sn 2005ip ( red ) from @xcite , which was a type  iin explosion that was unusually bright at late times because of strong and persistent ongoing csm interaction . with the exception of a few narrow coronal lines that are especially strong in sn  2005ip @xcite",
    ", figure  [ fig : blue ] shows that a late - time sn  iin actually provides quite a good match for the blue excess emission in ugc  2773-ot .",
    "the presence of fast ejecta and a growing contribution to the observed spectra from shock emission is interesting in the context of making comparisons between ugc  2773-ot and the great eruption of @xmath0  carinae .",
    "there are several lines of evidence that point to a strong shock as being important for powering @xmath0 car s great eruption : ( 1 ) the very fast ejecta outside the homunculus , moving at speeds of 3000 - 5000 km s@xmath3 @xcite , which are hard to achieve in a wind model that can also form the slower homunculus @xcite , ( 2 ) the large ratio of kinetic energy to total radiated energy that exceeds unity @xcite , ( 3 ) the very thin walls of the homunculus nebula that seem to have been compressed in a radiative shock @xcite , and ( 4 ) spectra of light echoes of @xmath0 car that seem inconsistent with expectations for an opaque wind model @xcite .",
    "these indicators of explosive mass loss seem , at first glance , to be at odds with the decade - long duration of the bright plateau in @xmath0 car , which is of course much longer than the short duration of hydrodynamic mass ejection .",
    "using a simple 1-d model of csm interaction , however , @xcite showed that the long plateau of @xmath0 car s 19th century event could be powered by csm interaction by adopting physical parameters that are consistent with the mass and kinetic energy now observed in the homunculus .",
    "the fact that observed spectra of the ugc2773-ot transient show evidence for an increasing contribution from shock - powered emission reinforces the conclusion that shocks play an important role in powering the long - duration high - luminosity plateaus of these two events , and also bolsters the comparison between ugc2773-ot and @xmath0  car ( note that spectra of light echoes corresponding to @xmath0 car s long 1850s plateau are still being analyzed ; smith et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "some observed evidence for strong shock excitation has been reported for other sn impostors as well , usually showing a characteristically `` hot '' spectrum ( see @xcite ) .",
    "some of these are the pre - sn eruptions of sn  2009ip @xcite , sn  2000ch @xcite , and snhunt248 @xcite .",
    "all of these , however , have exhibited brief luminosity spikes ( weeks to months ) , not sustained decade - long events like @xmath0  carinae and ugc  2773-ot .",
    "one of the most remarkable aspects of the spectral evolution of ugc  2773-ot in its first 2000 days is its h@xmath4 line ( figure  [ fig : halpha ] ) . in particular",
    ", we note the change in profile shape from a normal p  cyg profile that one might attribute to a moderately slow wind , to a multi - peaked and asymmetric pure emission profile , accompanied by a huge increase in strength of h@xmath4 emission .    as noted above",
    ", various spectral clues suggest a significant contribution to the optical emission from shock excited gas in csm interaction .",
    "this is especially true for h@xmath4 , where shock excitation likely dominates the broad ( @xmath181000 km s@xmath3 ) h@xmath4 luminosity .",
    "while the earliest epoch showed a similar line profile in h@xmath4 and h@xmath6 , the late - time h@xmath6 does not show a broad multi - peaked line profile like h@xmath4 , and it does not exhibit a comparable increase in strength .",
    "in fact , no other emission line in the spectrum shows a profile similar to that of h@xmath4 .",
    "this argues that the strong h@xmath4 emission is caused by shock excitation in a similar vein to the strong h@xmath4 emission that often dominates the late - time spectra of sne  iin ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in a steady wind , one expects balmer transitions and other lines to exhibit similar profile shapes .",
    "line profile observed in ugc  2773-ot to the h@xmath21 emission from the homunculus nebula around @xmath0 carinae .",
    "the top panel shows the 2d long - slit spectrum of h@xmath21 s(1 - 0 ) 2.122 @xmath22 m emission from the homunculus .",
    "this is an average of 5 adjacent slit positions with the slit aligned along the major ( polar ) axis of the bipolar nebula , excluding a region around the bright central star .",
    "these h@xmath21 spectra were obtained with the phoenix spectrograph on gemini south , and the individual positions were presented by @xcite . the bottom panel compares the line profile of this h@xmath21 emission integrated along the slit ( meant to mimic the integrated h@xmath21 line profile observed for the whole homunculus nebula ) .",
    "this is the thick orange curve , which is compared to the h@xmath4 profile observed in ugc  2773-ot ( black ) on 2013 sep .",
    "4.,width=278 ]    if we assume that late - time h@xmath4 emission traces the postshock gas in csm interaction , then the unusual profile of h@xmath4 holds important clues about the geometry of the ejecta and csm .",
    "the line became much stronger with time , but the profile shape also changed dramatically . a blue bump of excess emission appeared in our second epoch of spectra on day 478/479 ( see figure  [ fig : halpha ] ) .",
    "the blue bump was located at roughly @xmath1360 km s@xmath3 , which is roughly the same speed as the p cygni absorption trough in the first epoch on day 34 @xcite .",
    "( this blue bump is not at the correct wavelength to be [ n  ii ] @xmath76548 ; see figure  [ fig : halpha ] . )",
    "the blue bump then grew stronger with time and migrated to faster blueshifted speeds . at later times",
    "( days 1000 - 2000 ) the blue bump is seen at roughly @xmath1600 to @xmath1800 km s@xmath3 , while a corresponding red bump develops as well ( although less pronounced ) . at later times",
    "the h@xmath4 profile exhibits very steep blue and red wings , unlike the profile wings from electron scattering in a wind .",
    "a qualitatively similar asymmetric blue bump in h@xmath4 has been seen at different speeds in several sne  iin @xcite , and is usually attributed bipolar or perhaps disk - like geometry in the shock interaction .",
    "a corresponding red bump is usually assumed to be weaker or absent due to extinction by dust or occultation by the opaque sn photosphere .",
    "radiative transfer simulations of sne  iin with bipolar csm support these expectations of having an asymmetric blue emission line arising from a bipolar geometry @xcite .",
    "the increasing speed with time seen in ugc  2773-ot is likely due to the dominant emission migrating from the slower preshock csm to the accelerated post shock gas .",
    "this sign of asymmetry in the line profiles during the eruption has important implications for understanding the origin of bipolar nebulae around lbvs and other massive stars .",
    "since the blue bump is seen from emission lines that arise in csm interaction during the transient event itself , this requires that the shaping of the bipolar nebula occurs during the event or before ( imprinted in the inner csm ) , and is not due to hydrodynamic shaping over a long time after the event .",
    "so , for example , the bipolar nebula seen centuries or thousands of years later does not arise from an asymmetric posteruption wind , nor from interaction between a wind and an extended disk - like csm at large radii .",
    "the bipolar geometry must be inherent to the physics of the explosion itself , or to the csm ejected immediately before that is overtaken by the ejecta during the observed event .",
    "in this paper we have compared ugc  2773-ot s recent long - lasting eruption to the historical 19th century eruption of @xmath0 carinae @xcite . in that spirit",
    ", figure  [ fig : halphaeta ] makes another relevant comparison .",
    "this figure shows the asymmetric h@xmath4 line profile observed at late times in ugc  2773-ot , and compares it to the present - day line profile of emission from the homunculus nebula around @xmath0 car . at the present epoch , @xmath0",
    "car s ejecta have cooled and the nebula is seen as a dusty reflection nebula at visible wavelengths , rather than in h@xmath4 emission .",
    "however , the dense thin shell that contains most of the mass in the homunculus emits bright near - ir h@xmath21 lines @xcite . in the csm interaction model proposed by @xcite ,",
    "the thin walls of the homunculus seen today in h@xmath21 correspond to the cold dense shell of postshock gas that would have emitted bright h@xmath4 during the eruption .",
    "therefore , the comparison in figure  [ fig : halphaeta ] is physically motivated , because the different lines are tracing essentially the same postshock gas , before or after it cools .",
    "the h@xmath21 emission line profile shown here is an attempt to mimic the integrated h@xmath21 profile of the entire nebula , as if the homunculus were an unresolved point source at a large distance .",
    "this is accomplished by summing the h@xmath21 emission along the slit , for the several different slits used to map the homunculus with the phoenix spectrograph at gemini south .",
    "these data were originally presented and discussed by @xcite .",
    "the result of this exercise is that the integrated h@xmath21 emission from the homunculus nebula shows a profile that is very similar to that of the h@xmath4 emission observed now in ugc  2773-ot .",
    "a strong blue bump is seen from the front of the approaching blueshifted polar lobe of the nebula , and a central peak is seen from slower material at the pinched waist of the nebula .",
    "the emission peak from the receding polar lobe is suppressed in this case by dust extinction in the homunculus @xcite .",
    "this comparison makes a strong plausibility argument that the h@xmath4 profile seen in ugc  2773-ot could arise in a bipolar shell created by csm interaction , as in @xmath0 car , and it underscores the potential similarity of the two objects .    at late times",
    ", lines of [ ca  ii ] and ca  ii also exhibit unusual and asymmetric profile shapes ( figure  [ fig : ca2 ] ) , and the emission components trace different velocities than h@xmath4 .",
    "the forbidden lines of the [ ca  ii ] @xmath87291,7324 are not contaminated by absorption .",
    "their profiles are quite boxy , with double peaked horns at the relatively flat top of the profile , and their steep line wings extend only to about half the velocity seen in h@xmath4 .",
    "such differences are not expected in a wind where radiation scatters out from a central source , and where forbidden lines would presumably trace the outermost material at the final coasting velocity ( faster than in the inner wind acceleration region ) . instead , the stark differences in line profile shape and width between h@xmath4 and [ ca  ii ] may arise because they trace different latitudinal zones in the shock front .",
    "a bipolar shock front will have significantly different speeds  and hence different excitation / ionization levels  at the slow equator and fast poles .",
    "h@xmath4 may trace the stronger and faster shock at the polar regions of the bipolar shock , whereas [ ca  ii ] emission may be restricted to lower speed and lower excitation material near the equator or mid latitudes .",
    "the fact that the ir triplet ca  ii lines show these faster speeds in absortption that are similar to h@xmath4 emission supports this conjecture .",
    "although we have discussed above how ugc  2773-ot bears many observable similarities to the historical 19th century eruption of @xmath0 carinae , there is one key difference that needs to be mentioned .",
    "this difference stems from the fact that ugc  2773-ot shows a smooth light curve , whereas @xmath0 car shows a series of repeating brief luminosity spikes in its historical data @xcite , especially before 1845 , as noted in the introduction .",
    "these brief luminosity spikes seem to coincide with times of periastron passage in the very eccentric binary system if we extend the present day 5.5 yr orbit back in time , with a small adjustment to the period for the mass lost in the event @xcite .",
    "the periastron events have been discussed in terms of grazing stellar collisions at periastron due to an inflated primary star s envelope @xcite , and periastron accretion events onto a companion that power the event and blow jets that shape the bipolar homunculus @xcite .",
    "if these brief encounters are missing in ugc  2773-ot but it produces a long - lived eruption and a bipolar nebula anyway , we may be receiving a clue that the periastron collisions could be a secondary effect rather than the driving mechanism of these eruptions .",
    "this last point is speculative , however , and additional examples of similarly persistent lbv giant eruptions with well - sampled photometry would be valuable in this regard .",

    "<S> while supernova ( sn ) impostors resemble the great eruption of @xmath0 carinae in the sense that their spectra show narrow h lines and they have typical peak absolute magnitudes of @xmath113 to @xmath114 mag , most extragalactic events observed so far are quite different from @xmath0  car in duration . </S>",

    "<S> we discuss extensive spectroscopy of the ongoing eruption . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra show interesting changes in velocity and line shape that we discuss in detail , including an asymmetric h@xmath4 emission line that we show is consistent with the ejection of a bipolar nebula that could be very much like the homunculus of @xmath0 car . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , changes in the line width , line profile , blue excess emission resembling that of type  iin supernovae , and the intensity of h@xmath4 suggest the presence of strong circumstellar interaction in the eruption at late times . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the hypothesis that the extended plateau of @xmath0 car s eruption may have been powered by shock interaction as well . </S>",
