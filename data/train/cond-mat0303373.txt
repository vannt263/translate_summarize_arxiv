    "since the mid 1990 s , several compounds of pr have been found to exhibit heavy fermion behavior . the crystalline electric field ( cef ) ground state of the pr@xmath5 ions in these compounds appears to be a @xmath6 nonmagnetic doublet that carries an electric quadrupole moment .",
    "it is conceivable that the heavy fermion state in these pr compounds could originate from the interaction between the pr@xmath5 electric quadrupole moments and the charges of the conduction electrons",
    ". this would be the electric analogue of the exchange interaction between the magnetic dipole moments of ce or u ions and the conduction electron spins that is widely believed to be responsible for the heavy fermion state in most ce and u heavy fermion compounds .",
    "in fact , such a mechanism was proposed by cox in 1987 @xcite to account for the non - fermi liquid temperature dependences of certain normal state physical properties of the heavy electron superconductor ube@xmath11 .",
    "the pr compounds that display heavy fermion behavior include prinag@xmath12 @xcite , prfe@xmath13p@xmath1 @xcite , and , possibly , prfe@xmath13sb@xmath1 @xcite .    about a year ago , we reported that the compound pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 exhibits superconductivity with a superconducting critical temperature @xmath14 k that apparently develops out of a heavy fermi liquid with a quasiparticle effective mass @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mass of the free electron @xcite . as far as we know , pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 is the first example of a heavy fermion superconductor based on pr ; all of the other known heavy fermion superconductors are compounds of ce or u. the superconducting state appears to be unconventional in nature and may consist of two distinct superconducting phases @xcite .",
    "an ordered phase , presumably of magnetic or quadrupolar origin , occurs at high fields @xmath17 tesla and low temperatures @xmath18 k @xcite , suggesting that the superconductivity may occur in the vicinity of a magnetic or quadrupolar quantum critical point ( qcp ) . in an effort to obtain information about the interactions that are responsible for the heavy fermion state and superconductivity in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1",
    ", we have performed measurements of various normal and superconducting state properties of this compound as a function of temperature , pressure , and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "analysis of magnetic susceptibility @xmath19 , specific heat @xmath20 , electrical resistivity @xmath21 , and inelastic neutron scattering measurements within the context of a cubic crystalline electric field ( cef ) yields a pr@xmath5 energy level scheme that consists of a @xmath6 nonmagnetic doublet ground state that carries an electric quadrupole moment , a low lying @xmath7 triplet excited state at @xmath8 k , and @xmath9 triplet and @xmath10 singlet excited states at much higher temperatures ( @xmath22 k and @xmath23 k , respectively ) @xcite .",
    "this scenario suggests that the underlying mechanism for the heavy fermion behavior in pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 may involve the interaction of pr@xmath5 electric quadrupole moments with the charges of the conduction electrons , rather than pr@xmath5 magnetic dipole moments with the spins of the conduction electrons .",
