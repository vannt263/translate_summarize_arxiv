    "for single stars with pulsations unstable to a driving mechanism such as the @xmath4 mechanism , pulsation properties are determined by the structure of the star , which usually changes very slowly with time via evolutionary processes , e.g. , nucleosynthesis for main - sequence stars , or cooling for white dwarfs .",
    "the timescales for these processes are hundreds to thousands of years , rather than the hours to years over which we have photometric data and detect significant variations . since growth rates calculated by linear nonadiabatic pulsation codes can be large ( normalized work 10@xmath510@xmath6 per period ) , pulsation amplitudes should grow relatively quickly to reach a limiting amplitude . on the other hand , stochastically excited pulsations , as found in solar - like and red giant stars , are continuously excited and damped , so their amplitudes are expected to vary .",
    "amplitude variations may be useful diagnostics of energy partition / exchange between modes , and may involve modes of degree @xmath7 @xmath8 3 that are more difficult to observe in photometry , or gravity modes with high amplitude in the stellar interior that are nt visible at the surface , or even stable modes .",
    "these variations may tell us something about energy exchange with internal dynamical processes ( convection , rotation , magnetic fields ) or changes in ionization regions that we can not observe directly",
    ". they may indicate interaction with the external environment , e.g. , via mass outflow , accretion , or tidal forces from a binary companion or planet .",

    "detecting ( or ruling out ) amplitude variations requires high - precision continuous time series data that captures many pulsation periods .",

    "we first tested the matlab script on _ kepler _ data for kic 7106205 ( k@xmath14 mag = 11.455 ) , and easily detect in long - cadence data the large amplitude decrease of the 13.3942 c / d mode reported by ( * ? ? ?",
