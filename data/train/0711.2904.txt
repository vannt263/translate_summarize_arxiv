    "causal sets or causets are an approach to quantum gravity in which spacetime is discretized with causality as the fundamental relation between the discrete elements .",
    "the requirement that the as - yet unknown theory of causet dynamics should give rise to a smooth classical spacetime imposes strong restrictions on the character of the theory .",
    "in particular , the requirement that physics should appear to be lorentz - covariant implies a poisson relation between the classical volume of a region of spacetime and the number of discrete elements in it .",
    "the mean number of elements per planck volume , @xmath0 , in the poisson process is the only free parameter in the theory on macroscopic scales .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that the fluctuations in the poisson process naturally give an appropriately sized dark energy if the volume of the universe is taken as conjugate to @xmath1 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the same principle predicts a randomly fluctuating @xmath2 of roughly constant amplitude @xmath3 throughout the history of the universe , with the name everpresent @xmath1 given to the phenomenon .",
    "a fundamental objection to this explanation of dark energy was raised in @xcite , which noted that since everpresent @xmath1 is sourced in past light cones ( plcs ) of points , regions of the last - scattering surface separated by more than a causal horizon should have uncorrelated @xmath1 , and should produce @xmath4 cmb anisotropies .",
    "a limit of @xmath5 was therefore placed on @xmath3 , too small for it to explain late - time acceleration . in this paper",
    "we flesh out the objection in @xcite with a numerical analysis based on the volumes of overlapping plcs and place more constraints on @xmath3 .    to emphasize that we are not considering a cosmological",
    "constant we will break from the notation used in @xcite and use @xmath6 to represent the causet dark energy , rather than @xmath1 .",
    "we make use of a formulation for everpresent @xmath6 introduced in @xcite : we consider the @xmath6 to be the total hamiltonian action @xmath7 per unit spacetime volume @xmath8 , with each causet element having randomly signed action @xmath9 : @xmath10    the volume @xmath8 is of the past light cone ( plc ) of any point , and in a discrete spacetime is proportional to the number of elements @xmath11 in it . in conformal time @xmath12",
    ", @xmath8 is given by @xmath13    since the action for each element is randomly chosen as @xmath9 , the total comes from binomial statistics : @xmath14 the variance of @xmath6 is therefore given by @xmath15 since @xmath16 this formulation provides a density which oscillates randomly with amplitude @xmath17 at every epoch  an everpresent @xmath6 .",
    "we can also use this formulation to determine the two - point correlations of @xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath6 is sourced by the action in a plc , we split the plcs of two points into shared and disjoint regions .",
    "we use the notation @xmath18 and consider the volume splitting that is illustrated in figure [ fig - schematic ] . @xmath19 the second line follows because the volumes cancel , the third because disjoint volumes have zero correlation , and the fourth by construction of @xmath7 .",

    "the instantaneous three - volume of the overlapping region is the overlap between the two points ( spherical ) horizon volumes .",
    "the 4-volume can then be found by integrating this quantity .",
    "the overlap volume of two spheres of equal radii @xmath27 and separation @xmath28 is @xcite : @xmath29 if @xmath30 , and zero otherwise .    in our case for a point at time @xmath12 , the horizon of a point a time @xmath31 earlier grown forward to @xmath12 is @xmath32 . for a comoving separation",
    "@xmath33 the proper separation is @xmath34 and the comoving horizon is @xmath12 , so converting to a proper 3-volume : @xmath35 if @xmath36 , and zero otherwise .    to compute the 4-volume of the plc at @xmath12",
    "we integrate this quantity with the time element @xmath37 : @xmath38    we use the @xmath25 and @xmath26 from equation [ eq - volume ] , and get the covariance by multiplying by @xmath39 .    to obtain cmb spectra from the @xmath6 overlap we require a source term that converts from metric fluctuation to radiation anisotropy ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we use : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the visibility function , @xmath42 is the optical depth to time @xmath12 , and @xmath43 is the conformal gauge perturbation variable .",
    "@xmath44 is computed in a standard way from the cosmic reionization history .",
    "we have neglected the effect of the metric fluctuation on the plasma , since the latter does not have time to respond to the former , which changes over a hubble time .",
    "we have also neglected the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "we can find an expression for @xmath43 from the einstein equations , but it will always be in terms of unknown stress - energy components .",
    "we have no stress - energy tensor for @xmath6 that we could use to fully compute @xmath43  we only have one component .",
    "we will discuss two assumptions that can be made about @xmath6 dynamics to make progress .",
    "implementations of each are discussed in section [ sec - imp ] .",
    "if we substitute for the spatial conformal perturbation @xmath45 in the perturbed einstein equations @xcite we can obtain @xmath43 . letting : @xmath46 then : @xmath47    one approach is to neglect @xmath48 altogether , and have the cmb sourced by @xmath6 alone .",
    "this might be expected to give an answer of the correct order , since velocity and density perturbations are typically the same magnitude , and unlikely to cancel exactly . in that case : @xmath49 where in the last line we have set @xmath50 because it is formally undefined .    in this approximation",
    "we therefore take @xmath51 .",
    "another reasonable assumption that we could make would be that like many other forms of dark energy , the everpresent @xmath6  has zero anisotropic metric shear . in that case @xmath52 and we can find @xmath43 in terms of @xmath53 :    @xmath54    @xmath55    which has the solution : @xmath56 we have set the constant of integration to zero so that there is no perturbation at zero time .",
    "the @xmath57 part of the integrating factor can be split off and integrated to @xmath58 so that : @xmath59 where : @xmath60 here @xmath61 is playing the role of a kernel , defining the length of time over which @xmath6 contributes to @xmath43 .",
    "it peaks to unity at @xmath62 and falls off over about a hubble time , or longer for longer wavelengths .",
    "we can compute @xmath61 simply from the background dynamics of the system .",
    "equation [ eq - shear - psi ] relates the dynamic @xmath6 and @xmath43 . for our purposes",
    "we need the relation between the root - mean - square quantities .",
    "this becomes somewhat more computationally involved : @xmath63 we use the square - root of this quantity in the cmb sources .",
    "the quantity @xmath64 is an _ unequal time correlator _ similar to ones used in studies of textures and strings @xcite .",
    "we need to calculate it for each pair of times @xmath65 where @xmath61 is not negligible , for each wavenumber @xmath66 .    as with the equal time version ( to which it should reduce when @xmath67 ) , we use equation [ eq - corr - overlap ] to compute this correlator .",
    "this time , though , @xmath68 . to calculate @xmath69 we once again consider overlapping spheres , this time of unequal radii .",
    "the overlap volume of two spheres of radii @xmath70 and @xmath71 with separation @xmath28 is @xcite : @xmath72    once again we substitute @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and integrate : @xmath76 \\\\ &   a^4(\\tau ' ) \\mathrm{d}\\tau ' \\ , .",
    "\\end{split } \\label{cau - eq - unqualvolume}\\ ] ]    we get @xmath25 and @xmath26 from equation [ eq - volume ] , and go from the correlation to the covariance by multiplying by @xmath77 .",
    "we modified the cmb boltzmann code cmbeasy @xcite to include the perturbations described .",
    "the code , which is restricted to flat universes , first computes the background evolution of the cosmos , which we leave unchanged , and then evolves perturbations ( which we skip for the causet @xmath6 ) , and finally computes cmb sources and calculates their @xmath78 .",
    "we compute the @xmath6 contribution at the same values of @xmath12 and comoving wavelength @xmath66 as the code uses in its standard mode , since these are the periods when the visibility @xmath44 is significant enough for the perturbations to make a contribution to the cmb .",
    "we obtain quantities in harmonic @xmath66-space using a fast fourier transform routine @xcite from the real space quantities that we calculate using the volume overlap functions .",
    "the expression for the plc volume in equation [ eq - volume ] can be split up into : @xmath79   \\ , ,   \\label{cau - eq - volume2}\\ ] ] where : @xmath80    and thus : @xmath81    we can split the overlapping volumes of the plcs in equation [ cau - eq - overlap ] in a similar way .",
    "the integrals range from @xmath82 to the time when the horizon spheres are smaller than the comoving separation of the points .",
    "we therefore use the quantities : @xmath83 provided the integral range is positive .",
    "we can use the functions @xmath84 defined in equation [ cau - eq - idot ] to express @xmath85 : @xmath86 if @xmath87 , and zero otherwise .    using these quantities",
    "the overlap volume is :    @xmath88 \\label{cau - eq - overlapsplit - v } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we use this formula , with the volume formula , to compute the @xmath89 covariance for the cmb sources .    to compute the unequal - time overlaps in equation [ cau - eq - unqualvolume ]",
    "we define yet another set of retarded volumes . in this case",
    "the latest time @xmath12 at which the horizons overlap is a function of both @xmath90 and @xmath91 : @xmath92 \\label{cau - eq - overlap2-s }   \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 if @xmath94 , and zero otherwise , and @xmath95    since computing the overlap volumes was somewhat computationally intensive , and was repeated for each @xmath66 , we wrote code to perform it once for all the relevant @xmath66 and pairs @xmath90 and @xmath91 during the peak of recombination , and save the data .",
    "we then looked up the result in the main code where necessary .",
    "we use two other devices to speed the code : we compute the correlators only when the kernels @xmath96 are not small ( that is , only for @xmath90,@xmath91 in the recent past of @xmath12 ) , and we compute the overall sources only when the visibility is greater than @xmath97 of its maximum .",
    "our results are in the form of standard cmb power spectra , for temperature only since we do not consider any polarization sources in the calculation . in each case",
    "we obtain a limit on the fundamental parameter @xmath3 of the causal set theory .    the result from the zero velocity assumption , for @xmath98 ,",
    "is shown in figure [ cau - fig - cl2 ] .",
    "it has two expected features : power - law increase with scale , which occurs as the the separation between points on the lss increases and their shared volume rapidly decreases ; and a kink @xmath99 , which corresponds to the causal horizon on the last scattering surface , and is thus where volumes become completely disconnected .",
    ".,width=302 ]    figure [ cau - fig - cl3 ] shows the result of the zero shear computation , for @xmath100 .",
    "the kink at the causal horizon is retained , but the slope at large scales is reduced because at large scales the terms with the @xmath101 factor in equation [ cau - eq - zeroshear1 ] ( which were implicitly all we included in the zero velocity assumption ) lose dominance .",
    "under both our assumptions we can place strong limits on the value of the fundamental causet parameter @xmath3 , which controls the amplitude of all the causet fluctuations and thus ( quadratically ) controls the power spectra scales . in both cases , and",
    "probably in all simple models , the causet @xmath78 are largest at low @xmath102 .",
    "this makes comparing the predictions to data straightforward ; we can simply see at what @xmath3 the low-@xmath102 causet @xmath78  is equal to the measured value .",
    "a higher @xmath3 would lead to higher @xmath78   and is therefore ruled out .    in both cases , as predicted by barrow , the large scale cmb values limit @xmath3 to well below @xmath103 .",
    "the exact constraint depends on the detail of the conversion from the @xmath6 perturbation to @xmath43 . in the case of the zero velocity assumption described above the limit",
    "is is approximately @xmath104 . in the case of the zero shear assumption",
    "the limit is approximately @xmath105 . in both these cases ,",
    "again as barrow notes , the given @xmath3 is too small to generate late time acceleration .",
    "we would require @xmath3 to be at least @xmath106 to achieve that .",
    "we therefore concur with barrow and find no loophole in the mechanics of causal set structure formation that would invalidate his conclusion that everpresent @xmath6  is not dark energy .    from a positive perspective",
    ", we can think of these results as providing direction to the theory . a successful version of it must resolve the problem of excess structure formation , but retain acceleration at late times .",
    "this might come about by finding a very unusual stress - energy tensor , by suppressing @xmath6 at early times , or by modifying the einstein equations more dramatically .",
    "the last seems the most promising possibility .",
    "i am grateful to rafael sorkin and fay dowker for an introduction to , and useful discussions about , causets .",
    "i am also grateful to andrew jaffe for much useful discussion about causal sets and many other things .",
    "most of this work was carried out during an stfc studentship ; some was also carried out during a visit to the perimeter institute for theoretical physics ."
