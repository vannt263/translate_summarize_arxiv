    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are systems in which a low - mass donor star transfers mass via roche - lobe overflow onto a neutron star ( ns ) or black hole ( bh ) . many of the lmxbs are transient systems .",
    "these transients undergo occasional outbursts during which they typically reach peak luminosities of @xmath30.011 times the eddington luminosity ( @xmath10 ) , but they spend most of their time in quiescence , with much lower luminosities . here",
    "we adopt the definition of quiescence ( for bh lmxbs ) by @xcite , @xmath11 .",
    "we note that finding a source at @xmath12 does not necessarily mean that a source is detected at its minimum quiescent luminosity , as sources have been found with @xmath13 as low as a few times @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the nature of the accretion flow in quiescence is still a matter of debate . proposed",
    "explanations for the very low quiescent luminosities include radiatively inefficient flows @xcite and low net accretion rates in the inner regions as the result of disk winds @xcite or jets @xcite .",
    "in the last decade , the high sensitivities of _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _   have opened up the possibility of detailed x - ray studies of quiescent lmxbs down to eddington ratios as low as @xmath3@xmath15 @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "these observations have revealed that , when comparing lmxbs with similar orbital periods ( @xmath16 ) , quiescent ns systems have on average higher luminosities than quiescent bh systems , by factors of @xmath310100 @xcite .",
    "this can clearly be seen in figure [ fig : orbital ] .",
    "it is important to consider systems with the same @xmath16 ; at a given @xmath16  bh and ns lmxbs are assumed to have similar quiescent mass accretion rates @xcite . expected",
    "mass transfer rates for quiescent bhs and nss were calculated by @xcite , and they showed that for quiescent lmxbs there should exist a minimum mass transfer rate that stems directly from the existence of a bifurcation orbital period , @xmath17 . below this period",
    "the mass transfer is driven by gravitational wave radiation and above it , it is dominated by the nuclear evolution of the secondary star . specifically , the mass transfer rate increases with decreasing orbital period below @xmath17 , while it increases with @xmath16  above @xmath17 . for a wide range of donor masses ,",
    "the results of @xcite imply @xmath18510 hr for bhs and @xmath1835 hr for nss .",
    "the luminosity difference between quiescent bh and ns lmxbs has been interpreted as evidence for the presence of an event horizon in bh lmxbs @xcite , although it may also be the result of jet - dominated states in quiescent bh lmxbs @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the lowest - luminosity quiescent source currently known ( @xmath19 ergs@xmath1 ) is an ns lmxb , 1h 1905 + 000 @xcite .",
    "however , this source is likely an ultra - compact with an orbital period less than 80 minutes @xcite , and therefore falls in a @xmath16  range ( @xmath204 hr ) in which , until recently , no quiescent bh lmxbs had been observed .",
    "arrows indicate upper limits on luminosity or orbital period . based on data presented in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite.,width=302 ]    another result of the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations of quiescent lmxbs concerns the nature of the quiescent accretion flow in bh systems.the quiescent state of bh lmxbs",
    "has often been considered a low - luminosity extension of the so - called low - hard state . indeed , in terms of radio / x - ray flux correlations , which likely trace the evolution of the accretion ( in)flow and/or jet outflow , quiescent bh lmxbs appear to follow the main relation seen in the low - hard state @xcite .",
    "however , recent observations suggest that in terms of x - ray spectral shape considerable evolution occurs in the accretion flow as some sources approach quiescence @xcite , with spectral power - law photon indices that are steeper ( @xmath32.22.5 ) than those seen in the low - hard state ( @xmath31.5 ) .",
    "a recent study of the quiescent spectra of ten bh lmxbs by @xcite suggests that , once these sources reach @xmath21 , their spectra saturate at power - law indices of @xmath22 .",
    "based on their findings @xcite argue that quiescence does not appear to represent a distinct spectral state separated from the low - hard state .",
    "several mechanisms could be responsible for the observed steepening toward quiescence , such as , e.g. , a non - linear dependence of mass accretion rate on the inner - disk radius , as expected in the presence of outflows ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , changes in the properties of a comptonizing corona @xcite , or the jet s cooling break shifting through the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present _ chandra _  observations of maxi j1659152 , an x - ray transient that was discovered in 2010 september with the _ swift _ burst alert telescope @xcite .",
    "although it was originally thought to be a gamma - ray burst , optical spectra obtained with the very large telescope / x - shooter @xcite and x - ray observations with _",
    "@xcite strongly suggested that maxi j1659152  is an lmxb with a bh primary . during an outburst in 2010/2011 that lasted more than nine months ,",
    "the source was extensively observed with various x - ray @xcite , optical / near - infrared @xcite and radio observatories @xcite .",
    "these observations revealed that the source made several state transitions and showed behavior similar to that seen in many other transient bh lmxbs .",
    "the distance to maxi j1659152  has been estimated using various methods , with a most likely range of 4.58.5 kpc @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt a distance of 6 kpc in this paper .    _ xmm - newton _ and _ swift _ observations made during the rise and maximum of the outburst revealed the presence of dips in the x - ray light curves , from which an orbital period of 2.414@xmath230.005 hr was derived @xcite .",
    "this makes maxi j1659152  the bh lmxb with the shortest known orbital period .",
    "such a short orbital period is of particular interest to one of the issues described earlier : the difference between ns and bh quiescent luminosities at low @xmath16 .",
    "maxi j1659152  was already observed with _",
    "chandra _  during the initial decay of its outburst , a subsequent three - month reflare , and soon after the source appeared to have reached quiescence .",
    "the results of these observations were reported by @xcite .",
    "they found the source in a quiescent state during most of their observations .",
    "the minimum quiescent luminosity of maxi j1659152  was determined from two observations taken shortly after the reflare ; it falls at the high end of what is expected for its orbital period ( assuming a distance of 6 kpc ) , although it is still fainter than quiescent ns lmxbs with similar @xmath16  values .",
    "one explanation for this higher than expected luminosity could be that at the time of the last _ chandra _  observations the source still had not reached its minimum quiescent luminosity .",
    "the new _ chandra _  observations presented here were made about a year after the source had entered quiescence .",
    "they allow us to test whether the quiescent luminosity reported by @xcite was close to a minimum luminosity , or if the source had declined even further .",

    "based on the data presented in their paper , @xcite already suggested that such a minimum may exist at a limiting luminosity of a few times 10@xmath40 ergs@xmath1 .",
    "although the number of systems with @xmath16  of a few hours is still very small , the relatively high quiescent luminosity of maxi j1659152 , the shortest @xmath16  system , may be a further sign of the existence of a minimum quiescent luminosity for bh lmxbs , in a range consistent with that implied ( @xmath16@xmath3510 hr ) by the work of @xcite .",
    "additional support for the existence of a minimum quiescent luminosity for bh lmxbs may come from swift j1357.20933 , a very faint x - ray transient discovered in early 2011 @xcite .",
    "this system likely contains a bh @xcite and has a short orbital period of 2.8 hr @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : pli ] shows a steepening of the spectrum as the flux decreases . this has previously been seen in other sources @xcite , but our observations of maxi j1659152  present one of the clearest examples of spectral softening as a source recedes into quiescence .",
    "our _ chandra _  observations of maxi j1659152  allow us to set constraints on the luminosity level at which this softening starts . in observation 4 , which showed the highest luminosity of our observations ,",

    "the index was already significantly higher at 1.87(12 ) .",
    "it is therefore likely that in maxi j1659152  the spectral softening started between 0.510 kev fluxes of @xmath42 ergs@xmath1@xmath2 ( obs.1 ) and @xmath43 ergs@xmath1@xmath2 ( obs.4 ) .",

    "simulations that we performed suggest that a ridge contribution of as little as 5% can already result in detectable softening in a typical _ rxte _ observation .",
    "in other works @xcite attempts were made to correct the spectra for the galactic ridge emission .",

    "we therefore suspect that the reports of spectral softening based on _ rxte _ data may not be reliable and they should therefore be regarded with some caution .    as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , the softening of spectra in quiescence can be explained by a variety of models .",
    "quiescent spectra are generally not of sufficient quality for accurate spectral modeling ( beyond a simple power law ) and it is therefore difficult to test ( and distinguish between ) competing models for quiescent accretion flows .",
    "however , the observed softening ( and its relation with luminosity ) can possibly be used for this purpose .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that for convection - dominated accretion flows the softening in quiescence is expected to occur at luminosities below @xmath3@xmath57 @xmath10 , whereas our work shows that softening already starts at luminosities @xmath320600 times higher .",
    "the outburst light curve in figure [ fig : curve ] shows that maxi j1659152  had almost reached quiescence around day @xmath3220 .",
    "however , a major reflare , during which the luminosity increased by a factor of @xmath33000 , occurred soon after . while reflares ( or secondary maxima ) near the end of an outburst are not uncommon ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the magnitude of this reflare appears to be unusually high .",
    "this may be partly due to fact that the secondary maximum is well separated from the main outburst by a brief period of near - quiescence , whereas in other systems it occurred during ( the decay of ) the main outburst phase .",
    "given the short orbital period of the system it is possible that the secondary had undergone substantial x - ray heating of its outer layers , possibly resulting in a temporary increase in the mass transfer rate ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    finally , during its outburst maxi j1659152  showed spectral and timing signatures @xcite that suggested that the source had crossed the so - called `` jet line '' @xcite during its transition from the hard state to softer spectral states .",
    "such crossings have been associated with major ejection events , which are observed in the radio , but also on occasion in x - rays .",
