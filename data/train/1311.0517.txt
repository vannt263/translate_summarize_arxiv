    "we also used `` h - projective '' in our previous publications @xcite . recently a group of geometers studying c - projective geometry from different viewpoints decided to change the name from h - projective to c - projective , since a c - projective change of connections ( see ) , though being complex in the natural sense , is generically not holomorphic .    in this article",

    "a description is a special case of the results of apostolov et al @xcite on hamiltonian @xmath6-forms , we give some details in  [ sec : localclass ] .    despite the fact that the problem of classifying c - projectively equivalent pseudo - riemannian khler metrics is interesting on its own , we have another motivation for allowing the metrics to have arbitrary signature : the method how we obtained the description of the metrics admitting essential c - projective vector fields in fact requires the description of c - projectively equivalent khler metrics of arbitrary signature .",
    "we had the following motivation to study this problem .",
    "first of all , the problem is classical .",
    "the notions of @xmath0-planar curves , c - projective vector fields and c - projectively equivalent metrics were introduced by otsuki and tashiro  @xcite . for a certain period of time",
    "this theory was one of the main research directions of the japanese ( @xmath321950 - 1970 ) and soviet ( @xmath321970 - 1990 ) differential geometric schools .",
    "there are many publications and results in this theory and especially in the theory of c - projective vector fields , see for example @xcite for a list of references .",
    "most ( actually , all we have found ) results in the theory of essential c - projective vector fields are negative : under certain assumptions on the geometry of the manifold , it is proved that an essential c - projective vector field can not exist . as far as we know , before our paper there existed no explicit examples of essential c - projective vector fields on khler manifolds of nonconstant holomorphic curvature .",
    "our paper provides all possible examples in dimension four .",
    "furthermore , using the methods of our paper it is possible to construct an example for every dimension and every signature of the metric .",
    "this problem will be studied in a forthcoming article .",
    "the second motivation is that the problem is a natural complex version of a problem posed by sophus lie in 1882 . in @xcite , sophus",
    "lie explicitly asked to describe all two - dimensional metrics admitting projective vector fields .",
    "recall that a vector field is _ projective _ if its local flow sends unparametrised geodesics to unparametrised geodesics . from the context it is clear that s.  lie stated the problem in the local setup and allowed pseudo - riemannian metrics . in this setting , it has been solved only recently in @xcite .",
    "the problem we solve in this paper is , in fact , just the lie problem if we replace `` geodesics '' by `` @xmath0-planar curves '' .",
    "the main idea of our approach is borrowed from @xcite and was also implicitly used in @xcite . a main difficulty in implementing this idea to the c - projective setting was the lack of a local description of c - projectively equivalent khler metrics of indefinite signature .",
    "as mentioned above , even if we are interested in riemannian metrics only , the approach borrowed from @xcite requires the local description of c - projectively equivalent metrics of all signatures , see  [ trick ] for details .",
    "a third motivation is that there is a recent interest in the theory of c - projectively equivalent metrics from the side of khler geometers .",
    "it appears that c - projectively equivalent khler metrics correspond to hamiltonian two - forms introduced and studied in @xcite . in this context",
    ", the existence of an essential c - projective vector field is a natural geometric condition and we plan to study the possible implications of metrics admitting such a vector field in the future .",
    "finally , a main motivation was to prove the natural pseudo - riemannian generalisation of the yano - obata conjecture in the @xmath33-dimensional case ( see theorem [ yoconjecture ] below ) .",
    "assume @xmath34 is a khler surface ( i.e. , a real four - dimensional khler manifold ) of arbitrary signature .",
    "let @xmath35 be a @xmath0-hermitian metric on @xmath36 .",
    "we call the metrics @xmath16 and @xmath35 _ c - projectively equivalent _ , if @xmath0-planar curves of @xmath16 are @xmath0-planar curves of @xmath37 .",
    "this condition automatically implies that @xmath38 is also khler ( which easily follows from the relation below ) .",
    "if a vector field @xmath13 is c - projective for @xmath39 , then the pullback of @xmath16 with respect to the flow of @xmath13 is a khler metric that is c - projectively equivalent to @xmath16 .",

    "the riemannian analog of this statement is known as the yano - obata conjecture .",

    "the existence of a c - projective vector field for @xmath129 can easily be cast as an overdetermined pde system on the components of @xmath16 , @xmath0 and @xmath13 .",
    "the system is nonlinear , of second order in the derivatives of the unknown functions and is not tractable by standard methods .",
    "another method to study existence of c - projective vector fields is based on an observation of mikes and domashev @xcite who found a linear system of pdes whose solutions correspond to khler metrics that are c - projectively equivalent to a given one .",
    "the system of mikes - domashev allows one to rewrite the system of pdes that corresponds to the existence of a c - projective vector field as a linear system of pdes .",
    "the system is overdetermined , but unfortunately of third order .",

    "the occurrence of such a simplification might be surprising and indeed requires several preliminary results .",
    "the trick was recently effectively used to solve the lie problem @xcite and is explained in ( * ? ? ? * , especially  2.3 ) .",

    "the trick was already used in c - projective geometry in the proof of the ( riemannian ) yano - obata conjecture @xcite .",
    "let us explain the rough schema / idea / tools of the trick , the details and the calculations are in  [ sec : solvinglie ] .",
    "let @xmath130 be a complex manifold of real dimension @xmath131 .",
    "we define a _ c - projective structure _ @xmath132,j)$ ] on @xmath43 as an equivalence class of @xmath0-parallel affine torsion - free connections @xmath4 on @xmath133 .",
    "two such connections are ( c - projectively ) equivalent if they have the same @xmath0-planar curves .",
    "the condition that two connections are c - metrisable equivalent is in fact an easy linear algebraic condition , see .",
    "certain c - projective structures @xmath132,j)$ ] contain a levi - civita connection of a metric that is khler with respect to @xmath0 . in this case",
    "we say that the metric is _ compatible _ with the c - projective structure , and the c - projective structure is _",
    "it was recently observed in @xcite that metrics which are compatible with a c - projective structure @xmath132,j)$ ] are in one - to - one correspondence with nondegenerate solutions of a certain overdetermined system of linear partial differential equation . actually , as we already mentioned above , the existence of such a linear system of pdes was known before , see @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ,  2 ) .",
    "the advantage of the modification of this system suggested in @xcite is that the obtained system is c - projectively invariant . in the language of cartan geometry ,",
    "the system was obtained and explained in @xcite .",
    "since the system is linear , its space of solutions is a vector space .",
    "if its dimension is one , then all metrics compatible with the c - projective structure are mutually proportional with a constant coefficient of proportionality .",
    "then , every c - projective vector field is a homothety or a killing vector field .",
    "hence , it is not essential and therefore not of interest for this article .",
    "now , as it follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 6 ) ( and also from the earlier paper  @xcite where a similar statement was proven in the language of hamiltonian @xmath6-forms for positively definite metrics ) , if the space of solutions is at least three - dimensional , the metric has constant holomorphic sectional curvature and we are done .",
    "thus , the interesting case is when there exist two solutions @xmath134 of this system and any other solution is a linear combination of these two .",
    "we consider the lie - derivative of these solutions w.r.t . the c - projective vector field @xmath13 .",
    "since the solutions are sections of an associated tensor bundle , their lie derivative is a well - defined section of the same bundle and by standard arguments ( using that the system is c - projectively invariant ) one concludes that it is also a solution .",
    "since the space of solutions is two - dimensional , we have @xmath135 for certain constants",
    "@xmath136 , ... , @xmath137 . in other words , @xmath138 is an endomorphism of the ( two - dimensional ) space of solutions of the linear pde system we are interested in .",
    "if we replace @xmath11 and @xmath139 by another pair of linearly independent solutions , i.e. , if we consider another basis in the space of solutions , then the matrix @xmath140 changes by a similarity transformation . moreover , if we scale the projective vector field by a constant , the matrix of the corresponding endomorphism will be scaled by the same constant .",
    "thus , without loss of generality we may assume that the matrix @xmath140 is given by .",
    "now , the local description of the pairs of c - projectively equivalent metrics gives us the form of the solutions @xmath11 , @xmath139 in a local coordinate system .",
    "the local form depends on two functions of one variable , or on one holomorphic function of one variable , or on one function of one variable and one function of two variables which we consider to be unknown functions .",
    "in addition , the four components of the projective vector field are also considered to be unknown functions .",
    "the number of equations is relatively big : each equation of consists of actually six equations so altogether we have twelve equations .",
    "it appears that it is possible and relatively easy to solve this system , which we do .",
    "the result is the desired local classification of c - projective vector fields .",
    "the proof of the yano - obata conjecture ( theorem [ yoconjecture ] ) consists of two steps .",
    "first we prove that c - projectively equivalent metrics @xmath16 and @xmath37 of complex liouville type ( see theorems [ thm : normalformwithv ] and [ thm : allmetricsintheclass ] ) can not exist on a compact khler surface ( unless they are affinely equivalent ) .",
    "the point is that in the complex liouville case , the pair of metrics @xmath16 and @xmath37 gives rise to a natural @xmath141-tensor field @xmath142 with a complex eigenvalue @xmath143 that behaves as a holomorphic function on an open and ( locally ) dense set .",
    "as @xmath43 is compact , this property finally leads to a contradiction with the maximum principle unless @xmath143 is a constant which implies that the metrics are affinely equivalent .    in the other two ( liouville and degenerate ) cases we analyse the behaviour of the eigenvalues of @xmath144 and the scalar curvature of @xmath16 along trajectories of a c - projective vector field @xmath13 .",
    "it turns out that the eigenvalues of @xmath145 may be bounded only in the subcases l2 and d2 from theorem [ thm : normalformwithv ] .",
    "but in these two subcases , the explicit computation of the scalar curvature @xmath146 along a generic integral curve @xmath147 of @xmath13 shows that the boundedness of @xmath146 amounts to the fact that @xmath16 has constant holomorphic curvature .",
    "in  2 we recall and collect previously obtained results about c - projectively equivalent metrics and c - projective vector fields .",
    "we give precise references whenever possible , and prove most of the results for self - containedness ( since certain results were obtained in a different mathematical setup , e.g. , in the language of hamiltonian @xmath6-forms , and it is easier to prove these statements than to translate them ) .    in  3",
    "we partially extend the classification of apostolov et al .",
    "to the four - dimensional ( pseudo - riemannian ) khler case , see theorem [ thm : normalform ] .    having the classification of theorem [ thm : normalform ] at hand , in  4 we apply the technique explained in  [ trick ] to reduce our problem to a first order pde - system on @xmath13 and @xmath16 in frobenius form ( i.e. , such that all first derivatives of the unknown functions are explicit expressions in the unknown functions ) , and solve it .    finally ,",

    "then , the linearly independent vectors @xmath692 are contained in the two - dimensional subspace given by the orthogonal complement to @xmath693 .",
    "this gives us a contradiction and the claim follows .          let @xmath695 be the geodesic line segment containing all singular points and @xmath696 .",
    "assume , by contradiction , that @xmath697 is regular .",
    "consider @xmath698 and the two - dimensional subspace @xmath699 .",
    "the straight line segment connecting the vectors @xmath700 and @xmath701 lies in @xmath702 since as we have explained in the proof of lemma [ + 3 ] the geodesic @xmath9 is orthogonal to the killing vector fields at every point .",
    "we denote by @xmath208 a thin tubular neighborhood of this segment in @xmath699 , see figure [ 1 ] .",
    "if the neighborhood is sufficiently thin , the exponential mapping is well defined on @xmath208 and is an embedding of @xmath208 into @xmath276 , so its image , which we denote by @xmath703 , is a two - dimensional submanifold .",
    "notice that all the points @xmath704 which do not belong to @xmath9 are regular .",
    "on the other hand we know from the proof of theorem [ thm : normalform ] that on @xmath705 there is an integrable two - dimensional distribution defined by the subspaces @xmath702 whose leaves are totally geodesic .",
    "hence every geodesic starting at @xmath235 in the direction of @xmath208 belongs to the leaf of this distribution through @xmath235 if it does not leave the set of regular points . in other words ,",
    "the subset @xmath706\\}\\ ] ] of @xmath703 is contained as an open subset in the totally geodesic integral leaf of the distribution @xmath693 through the point @xmath235 and it is open and dense in @xmath703 , since @xmath707 is the only direction in @xmath208 in which geodesics starting initially in this direction can meet singular points .",
    "this implies that @xmath703 is a totally geodesic submanifold since this condition holds in a neighborhood of almost every point .",
    "furthermore , for all points @xmath708 the tangent space @xmath709 coincides with @xmath702 .",
    "therefore @xmath709 is @xmath145-invariant and the eigenvalues of the restriction @xmath710 are @xmath143 and @xmath678 with multiplicity one . by continuity , @xmath709 is still @xmath145-invariant even for @xmath711 and @xmath712 are still the eigenvalues of the restriction @xmath713 .",
    "thus , we see that at each point @xmath704 , the operator @xmath713 is conjugate to the matrix @xmath714 where @xmath715 .",
    "this allows us to introduce a natural complex structure @xmath716 on @xmath703 by setting @xmath717 .",
    "alternatively , we can define @xmath716 by noticing that ( up to the sign ) @xmath716 is the only complex structure on @xmath703 that commutes with @xmath713 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that at each regular point @xmath708 this complex structure coincides with the one given by the local classification of theorem [ thm : normalform ] . in particular",
    ", @xmath718 is a holomorphic function on @xmath719 with respect to @xmath716 . since @xmath143 is a smooth function on @xmath276 and hence on @xmath703",
    ", we obtain that @xmath143 is holomorphic on the whole of @xmath703 .",
    "this implies that @xmath720 is a harmonic function that attains its maximal value at @xmath721 .",
    "hence , by the maximum principle , @xmath722 and therefore @xmath143 are constant on @xmath703 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath143 does not depend on the direction orthogonal to @xmath703 ( see corollaries [ cor : killing ] and [ cor : commutekilling ] ) .",
    "thus , we obtain that @xmath143 is constant on an open neighborhood of @xmath668 in @xmath43 , which contradicts to our assumption that @xmath669 almost everywhere on @xmath667 .",
    "this proves the lemma .          by contradiction , assume that all points of @xmath9 are singular .",
    "since the differential of @xmath143 vanishes at each singular point , @xmath143 is constant along @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath672 be a regular point and let @xmath723 be a star - like open neighborhood of @xmath168 such that it is mapped diffeomorphically onto @xmath276 by the exponential mapping .",

    "we denote by @xmath719 the component containing @xmath235 joint with @xmath695 .",
    "consider the complex structure on @xmath719 constructed similar as in the proof of lemma [ + 4 ] and smoothly extend it from @xmath719 through the boundary @xmath9 to the domain @xmath725 so that , as the result , we obtain a complex structure on @xmath703 .",
    "more precisely , we have the field of operators @xmath726 defined on @xmath719 as in lemma [ + 4 ] .",
    "this field @xmath713 is smooth on @xmath719 including its boundary @xmath9 .",
    "we can smoothly extend this field from @xmath719 to @xmath725 in such a way that @xmath713 still has two distinct eigenvalues at every point , and then apply the formula @xmath717 from lemma [ + 4 ] to define the complex structure .",
    "the function @xmath143 ( restricted to @xmath719 ) is holomorphic with respect to this complex structure and is constant on @xmath9 .",
    "then , it is constant by morera s theorem @xcite on @xmath719 . to come to a contradiction",

    "we will show that for the parameters such that the scalar curvature is bounded , the corresponding metrics have constant holomorphic sectional curvature .",
    "note that we do not calculate the scalar curvature of the metrics @xmath16 from theorem [ thm : normalformwithv ] , since for these metrics it follows immediately that the restriction @xmath730 of the nonconstant eigenvalue @xmath143 of the tensor @xmath190 ( given by the formulas from theorem [ thm : normalform ] ) explodes if @xmath88 approaches infinity .",
    "these metrics can not be globally defined and we work with the generic representatives and of the c - projective class of @xmath727 instead .",

    "different types of the roots correspond to different cases in the classification theorem [ thm : normalformwithv ] .",
