    "<S> we present explicit expressions for the high - frequency asymptotic behavior of electron self - energy of general quantum impurity models , which may be useful for improving the convergence of dynamical mean - field calculations and for the analytic continuation of the electron self - energy . </S>",
    "<S> we also give results , expressed in more physical terms , for the two - orbital and three - orbital rotationally invariant slater - kanamori interactions , in order to facilitate calculations of transition metal oxides .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum monte carlo solutions of quantum impurity models@xcite play an important role in the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) of materials.@xcite in these calculations , knowledge of the high - frequency behavior of the electron self - energy is useful , both to improve the convergence of the dynamical mean - field self - consistency process@xcite and to provide the normalization needed for analytic continuation of the electron self - energy.@xcite while the general procedure for deriving the high frequency behavior is known,@xcite explicit expressions seem not to have appeared except for the single - orbital anderson impurity model@xcite and its cluster generalizations.@xcite    in this brief report , we present these results for general quantum impurity models . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the specialization to the two and three orbital models with rotationally invariant ( slater - kanamori)@xcite on - site interactions , relevant to late and early transition metal oxides@xcite where the physics is dominated by @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in supplementary material ( available online ) we present a mathematica notebook which generates the needed terms and presents the resulting output .    </S>",
    "<S> a quantum impurity model involves a set of `` impurity '' degrees of freedom coupled to a non - interacting bath . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by defining a general impurity model . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the impurity states by an index @xmath2 representing spin and orbital degrees of freedom and define the operator that creates an electron into impurity state @xmath2 as @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the bath states by an energy / momentum label @xmath4 and a spin / orbital index @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the operator creating an electron into one of these state . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity model is the sum of a non - interacting @xmath7 and interacting @xmath8 terms @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11    the electron self - energy @xmath12 is then a matrix in space of impurity model states @xmath2 with components @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> an expression for the high - frequency behavior can be obtained from examination of the short - time behavior of the electron green s function,@xcite which in turn can be expressed in terms of the commutator of the hamiltonian with electron operators . </S>",
    "<S> evaluating eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 215 ) and ( 216 ) of ref .   </S>",
    "<S> we find : @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 in these expressions the expectation values must in general be evaluated from the numerical solution of the quantum impurity model .    for the single - orbital anderson impurity model,@xcite </S>",
    "<S> the nonzero elements of the tensor @xmath19 may be chosen as @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> one can readily verify that eqs .  - yield the well - known results that@xcite @xmath22 while @xmath23 can be found by flipping all spin indices , and all `` off - diagonal '' self - energies ( e.g. @xmath24 ) are zero .    while these expressions [ eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> - ] may be straightforwardly programmed and evaluated for general impurity models and interactions , it is useful to present results for the important special case of single - site dynamical mean - field theory of @xmath25 electrons subject to rotationally invariant slater - kanamori interactions,@xcite because the results can be expressed in terms of physically relevant densities and the symmetries are automatically implemented , leading to fewer expressions to be evaluated .    </S>",
    "<S> the on - site interacting part of the slater - kanamori hamiltonian is traditionally expressed in terms of three parameters , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath5 labels the orbitals .    </S>",
    "<S> the five orbital states of the @xmath25-manifold are degenerate in free space , but in cubic symmetry are split into a doublet , transforming as the @xmath0 representation of the cubic group , and a triplet , transforming as the @xmath1 representation . in many materials </S>",
    "<S> one may restrict attention to one of these two manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry considerations then imply that the self - energy is diagonal in the orbital basis and , in paramagnetic states , diagonal in the spin states as well .    </S>",
    "<S> in the case of two - orbital model ( @xmath0 system ) , @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> we can express the high - frequency behavior for the self - energy of a spin up electron on orbital 1 in terms of expectation values of orbital densities and spin - exchange operators as @xmath32 and the forms for the other orbital / spin can be straightforwardly found by interchanging indices . </S>",

    "<S> the off - diagonal elements are also zero . in this formulation </S>",
    "<S> only 27 correlators ( with four fermionic operators ) need to be measured , rather than the @xmath37 correlators arising in a straightforward implementation of the general equations above .    </S>",
    "<S> as the number of orbitals increases , the number of terms proliferates , and for example in a treatment of the full @xmath38-fold degenerate @xmath25 manifold more than 100 terms occur . </S>",
    "<S> the expressions are too lengthy to present in the published version , but we include as supplementary information a mathematica notebook which generates the needed terms and presents the resulting output . in the same file </S>",
    "<S> we have also presented the calculation for the two and three orbital cases . </S>",
    "<S> this code can also easily be manipulated to treat hamiltonians with arbitrary interactions . </S>"
