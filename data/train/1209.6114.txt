    "it is well - known that fractures of drying paste show different properties depending on the thickness of the paste .",
    "the drying cracks are classified into two types . in the case that the thickness is larger than a horizontal length of system , the fragment s characteristic size on upper surface is limited and the cracks run slowly along depth direction . in this case , the cracks make prismatic structures . on the other hand , in the case that thickness is shorter than the size of system , the cracks approach the bottom of container immediately and do not make columnar structures . in this case",
    ", some interesting properties have been reported .",
    "groisman@xcite did some experiments by using coffee granular and reported that the average size of fragments is proportional to the thickness of the paste .",
    "furthermore , nakahara and matsuo@xcite reported that some kind of paste remembers the force they received or the directions they flowed before drying on their crack patterns .",
    "thus the properties of drying paste have been investigated vigorously , however , most of them were investigated only at the time when drying has finished .",
    "the patterns change every moment until the end of drying and the statistical properties change every moment .",
    "it is worth investigating the dynamical and statistical properties for understanding fractures of drying paste .",
    "there are studies for velocity of crack tips@xcite as the time - dependent properties , however , there are few studies of how patterns change with time . in this article , we focus on the properties of size of fragment as the time - dependent properties .    smoothed particle hydrodynamics(sph)@xcite is the one of methods to calculate equations of continuum .",
    "sph has been developed in the field of astrophysics to solve problems of compressible flow@xcite .",

    "there are also some studies of plastic - elastic materials@xcite and the formalization of treatments for ductile materials is nearly complete , however , the formalization of treatments for brittle materials have not been enough yet .",

    "however , there is a problem in the implementation of brittle fractures in the sph algorithm .",
    "resolving this problem is the key for reproducing fractures of drying paste by using sph .",
    "the aim of this article are ( i ) to reproduce a crack pattern of a thin drying paste with a continuum model by giving the implementation of the brittle material in the sph algorithm , and ( ii ) to investigate the dynamical and statistical properties of size of fragment with the sph simulation . to simplify the calculation",

    "we investigate two characteristic quantities which are convenient for understanding time evolution of the fragments size : the average size and the size distribution . as a result",
