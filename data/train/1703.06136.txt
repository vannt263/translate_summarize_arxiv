    "a milestone in the history of exoplanet detection was the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "survey for transiting planets in the globular cluster 47 tucanae ( ngc  104 ) by @xcite .",
    "this was the first space - based planet survey , as well as the first exploration of the planet population within globular clusters . despite observing @xmath334,000 stars nearly continuously for 8.3 days , with a precision",
    "high enough to detect giant planets , the authors did not find any planets .",
    "they concluded that hot jupiters ( hjs ) in 47  tuc are rarer by at least an order of magnitude than in the solar neighborhood .",
    "based on inject - and - recover tests and assumptions about planet occurrence that were reasonable at the time , they should have detected about 17 planets if the stars in 47  tuc and field stars had hjs with the same prevalence .    over time , this result has come to be regarded as unsurprising .",
    "there are many reasons to expect hj occurrence in globular clusters to be lower than in nearby stellar populations , the most obvious reason being metallicity . in the local neighborhood",
    ", the occurrence of short - period giant - planet occurrence is strongly associated with high metallicity , and 47 tuc has a low metallicity of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "other reasons have also been given .",
    "for example , giant planet formation or migration may be inhibited in environments with radiation from nearby massive stars .",
    "planets in globular clusters may be lost during stellar encounters @xcite .",
    "the clusters are old enough that hjs may have undergone tidal orbital decay @xcite or roche - lobe overflow due to tidal heating and expansion @xcite .",
    "while these reasons may seem compelling , they are not necessarily correct .",
    "the cause / effect relationship between metallicity and hot jupiters has not been demonstrated .",
    "it is conceivable that metallicity _ per se _ is irrelevant , and that other factors are important which are associated with high metallicity in the local neighborhood but not in 47 tuc .",
    "likewise , it is difficult to anticipate all the consequences of stellar encounters . surely they disrupt some planetary systems , but they might also enhance the rate of hj production through high - eccentricity migration . and if hjs form _ in situ _ in tight orbits @xcite , encounters might be irrelevant .",
    "there may even be modes of hj formation specific to globular clusters .",
    "in short , since neither hj formation nor globular cluster formation are understood , we should perform observational tests of even the most seemingly obvious expectations .    at the time of this pioneering _",
    "hst _ survey , only one transiting hj was known : hd  209458b @xcite .",
    "naturally , in interpreting their null result , @xcite assumed that all hjs resemble this particular planet , which was drawn from doppler surveys of nearby stars .",
    "after more than 15 years we have a better grasp on the prevalence and radius / period distribution of giant planets , which are crucial for evaluating the number of expected detections in a transit survey .",
    "we decided to test whether the conclusions of @xcite are still valid .",
    "data from the most recent space - based transit survey , the nasa _ kepler _ mission @xcite , are the best available for this purpose . in this work",
    ", we recalculate the number of expected detections in the 47  tuc survey , based on the planet statistics from _",
    "rather than relying on planet occurrence rates and distributions that have been inferred from the _ kepler _ data , we adopt a more direct procedure .",
    "first we construct a set @xmath5 of _ kepler _ stars with the same number of members as the sample of 47  tuc stars searched by @xcite .",
    "we do so by randomly choosing entries from the _ kepler _ input catalog ( kic ) .",
    "we thereby associate each star in 47  tuc with a _ kepler _ star . if the _ kepler _",
    "star has detected transiting planets , we assume that the corresponding star in 47  tuc has planets with the same properties",
    ". then we count the number of transiting planets that should have been detected by @xcite , taking into account the sensitivity of their detection pipeline and the ( mild ) differences in the transit probabilities between 47  tuc stars and the _ kepler _ stars .",
    "this whole procedure is repeated many times , to derive the probability distribution for the number of expected detections .    for each realization of @xmath5",
    "we compute the number of expected detections , @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the number of transiting planets that would have been detected around the @xmath8th star in @xmath5 , assuming it has planets with the same properties as the associated _ kepler _ star . in most cases , of course",
    ", the _ kepler _ star does not have any detected transiting planets , and @xmath9 .",
    "the dimensionless factor @xmath10 accounts for the difference in transit probability between the 47  tuc star and the associated _ kepler _ star ( see section  [ ssec : method_geometry ] ) .    to obtain @xmath7",
    ", we calculate the product of the detectability @xmath11 of each planet around that star and the probability @xmath12 that the planet is not a false positive , summed over the set @xmath13 of all the transiting planets around that star .",
    "the detectability @xmath11 depends on the planet s radius @xmath14 and orbital period @xmath15 as well as the star s apparent magnitude @xmath16 ( see section  [ ssec : method_efficiency ] ) .",
    "thus : @xmath17    the following subsections describe this calculation in more detail .      for the parameters of the 47  tuc stars",
    ", we use a list of the @xmath16 magnitudes for the stars searched with _",
    "hst _ that was kindly provided by r.  gilliland .",
    "we adopt the list of _ kepler _ target stars and their planet properties from data release ( dr )  24 , which includes the most recent catalog of planets and planet candidates . to assign masses and radii to the _ kepler _ stars",
    ", we use the posterior probability distributions from the dr  25 catalog @xcite .      for each roll of the dice in our monte carlo procedure , we perform the following steps :    1 .   construct a sample @xmath18 of _ kepler _ stars for which the _ kepler _ planet catalog is complete for the types of planets that could have been found in 47  tuc .",
    "2 .   construct a sample @xmath5 of @xmath19 main - sequence stars in 47  tuc and their relevant properties .",
    "3 .   associate each star in @xmath5 with a star drawn randomly from @xmath18 .    for step 1 ,",
    "each _ kepler _ star is assigned a mass and radius by drawing randomly from the posterior distributions for those quantities .",
    "then we identify the subset of those stars for which a planet with radius @xmath20 and period 8.3  days would have been detected with a multiple - event - statistic ( mes ) of 17 .",
    "the mes is computed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the product of the data span and duty cycle , and @xmath23 is the robust root - mean - squared combined differential photometric precision for the timescale of the corresponding transit duration @xcite , @xmath24 here the mean stellar density @xmath25 is computed from the mass and radius assigned as above , and the last factor @xmath26 comes from averaging over the impact parameter .",
    "the cdpp has only been tabulated for certain timescales between 1.5 and 15  hours .",
    "when @xmath27 is within that range , we compute @xmath23 by linear interpolation ; otherwise , following @xcite , we adopt the value that is tabulated for the closest available timescale .",
    "we also exclude the stars with @xmath28 because three transits are required for detection .",
    "a small number of stars for which cdpp values are unavailable are also omitted .",
    "these criteria typically leave us with about @xmath29 _ kepler _ stars in @xmath18 .",
    "the fluctuations in the size of @xmath18 arising from the random sampling of masses and radii are of order 0.1% .",
    "the size of @xmath18 is also insensitive to the exact choice of mes threshold ; when we lower it from 17 to 10 , the number of stars increases by less than @xmath30 .    for step 2 ,",
    "we draw @xmath19 stars by randomly sampling from the @xmath31 stars in 47  tuc that satisfy @xmath32 , the same criterion used by @xcite to select main - sequence stars .",
    "figure  [ fig:47tuc_hr ] shows the color - magnitude diagram for 47  tuc .",
    "the reason why only @xmath19 ( and not @xmath31 ) stars were searched for planets is that @xcite imposed a secondary selection based on @xmath33 ; see their figure  1 .",
    "we did not impose the same @xmath33 criterion because its functional form is not readily available .",
    "the resulting differences between our simulated samples , and the actual sample searched by @xcite , are very minor and negligible for our purpose .",
    "each star in @xmath5 is assigned a mass and radius based on its @xmath16 magnitude and the stellar - evolutionary models of @xcite , matching the procedure of @xcite .    in step 3 ,",
    "we construct a sample @xmath34 by randomly resampling ( with replacement ) the same number of stars from @xmath18 .",
    "this allows us to take into account the poisson fluctuations in the occurrence rate of planets in the _ kepler _ sample , although this source of uncertainty turns out to be minor .",
    "then , each star in @xmath5 is associated with a star in @xmath34 by randomly drawing an entry from @xmath34 .     and",
    "@xmath35 ( dashed lines).[fig:47tuc_hr ] ]      for most stars in @xmath5 , the corresponding _ kepler _ star has no detected transiting planets . in such cases the star in @xmath5",
    "is not assigned any planets .",
    "for cases in which the _ kepler _ star does have planets , the corresponding star in @xmath5 is assigned planets with the same orbital period @xmath15 and radius @xmath14 . by `` planets '' we mean kois with @xmath38 - 8.3  days , @xmath39 - 2  @xmath40 , and a dr24 disposition of",
    "either `` confirmed '' or `` candidate '' . because the stellar radii were assigned randomly from the posterior distribution , the planetary radius @xmath14 is recalculated in each realization as the product of the stellar radius and the planet - to - star radius ratio listed in the koi catalog .",
    "we neglect the uncertainty in the radius ratio because , for hjs , the leading source of uncertainty in @xmath14 is the uncertainty in the stellar radius .",
    "we also need to compute the factor @xmath12 in eqn .",
    "[ eq : nplanet ] , to account for false positives .",
    "we assume fpp  @xmath41 for `` confirmed '' kois .",
    "for the others , we use the fpps computed by @xcite .",
    "the geometric transit probability is @xmath43 , which is proportional to @xmath44 at fixed orbital period .",
    "since each star in @xmath5 has a different mean density than the corresponding kic star , we need to correct for the difference in transit probability .",
    "we do so by modifying the planet count around the @xmath8th star , @xmath7 , by the factor @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the mean densities of the _ kepler _ and 47  tuc stars associated with the @xmath8th star , respectively .",
    "@xcite used inject - and - recover simulations to determine the detection efficiency of their transit search as a function of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",

    "we construct 1000 realizations of the star and planet samples , following the procedures described in the previous section . in each case",
    "we compute @xmath62 , the number of transiting planets that would have been detected in the _ hst _ search of 47  tuc .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : hist ] shows the result : the expected number of detections is @xmath0 . here and elsewhere",
    "the quoted value is the median of the probability distribution of @xmath62 , and the uncertainty interval covers 68.3% of the probability surrounding the median ( a `` one - sigma '' interval ) .",
    "we also constructed another 1000 realizations , this time restricting the masses of the _ kepler _ stars to the range 0.568 - 0.876  @xmath63 , the same range of masses as the 47  tuc stars satisfying @xmath32 .",
    "we perform this test because there is evidence that the planet population around low - mass stars differs from that of high - mass stars . in this case , @xmath18 consists of approximately @xmath64 stars , and the expected number of detections is @xmath1 .",
    "this result is shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : hist ] .    as a check on our procedure",
    ", we constructed an additional 1000 realizations of @xmath5 , this time assigning planets based on the same assumptions as @xcite instead of using _ kepler _ data .",
    "specifically , we assume that hjs exist around 0.9% of all stars , with a transit probability of @xmath65 , and that all hjs have @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the radius and period are those of hd  209458b , the only hj that was known at the time . in this case",
    "we find @xmath68 , as shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : hist ] .",
    "this agrees with the conclusions of @xcite , validating our process for constructing @xmath5 and simulating the detection efficiency .",
    "the _ kepler_-based simulations give a smaller number of expected detections than 17 .",
    "table  [ tab : analytic ] breaks down the reasons for the difference .",
    "one factor is the lower occurrence rate of hjs in the _ kepler _ field compared to the value assumed by @xcite .",
    "the _ kepler _ occurrence rate is even lower when we restrict the range of stellar masses to 0.568 - 0.876  @xmath63 .",
    "another important factor is that the typical value of detectability in our planet sample is only about @xmath69 of the value for the hj assumed in @xcite ( second row in table [ tab : analytic ] ) .",
    "this is because the detectability is a strong function of planet radius , and the hjs in the _ kepler _ field are often smaller than @xmath70 .",
    "this situation is illustrated in figure [ fig : koi_hj_prop ] , which shows the @xmath14-@xmath15 distribution of the hjs around the _ kepler _ stars for one realization of @xmath18 .",
    "lcccc transiting hj occurrence @xmath71 & @xmath72 & @xmath73 & @xmath74 & @xmath75 + average detectability @xmath76 & @xmath77 & @xmath78 & @xmath79 & @xmath80 + average transit - probability correction @xmath81 & & @xmath82 & @xmath83 & @xmath84 + yield from @xmath19 stars & @xmath85 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 & @xmath88 +",
    "one of the critical factors that reduce the number of expected detections is the lower occurrence rate of transiting hjs in the _ kepler _ sample , compared to the rate assumed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also measured the hj occurrence rate based on _ kepler _ data . to facilitate a comparison between their study and ours",
    ", we calculate the occurrence rate of hjs , as opposed to transiting hjs .",
    "to do so we perform another set of simulations , this time with @xmath89 , and replacing eqn .",
    "[ eq : nplanet ] with @xmath90 i.e. , we divide by the transit probability @xmath43 .",
    "we adopt the value of @xmath91 from the koi catalog , assuming a circular orbit and neglecting the uncertainty . for consistency with @xcite",
    "we also modify the definition of  planets \" in section  [ ssec : method_planets ] to be those with @xmath92 and @xmath93 - 2  @xmath40 . through this procedure",
    "we find @xmath94 , in agreement with the value of 0.4% found by @xcite .    when restricting the _ kepler _ stars to the same range of masses as the stars that were searched in 47  tuc , we find @xmath95 , which is smaller than the rate obtained for the entire sample of stars .",
    "this suggests that the low - mass _ kepler _ stars have an even lower hj occurrence rate .",
    "the statistical significance of the difference is modest , because of the relatively small number of hjs ( @xmath310 ) in the restricted sample .",
    "this possible dependence of hj occurrence on stellar mass will come into sharper focus after the _ tess _ mission @xcite , which should provide a larger sample of transiting hjs around a wide range of stellar types .",
    "@xcite measured the hj occurrence rate using the doppler or radial - velocity ( rv ) technique .",
    "based on a sample of 10 hjs found within a set of 836 stars , they found @xmath96 , which is higher than our result by 1.9@xmath2 . if the occurrence rate is really 1.2% , the number of expected detections in the 47  tuc survey would be much higher than the results presented in the previous section . to demonstrate this",
    ", we perform another round of simulations using the rv sample from @xcite instead of _ kepler _ stars ; this time @xmath18 consists of @xmath97 stars considered in the rv sample of @xcite , among which @xmath98 are associated with hjs listed in table  [ tab : rvsample ] .",
    "one obstacle is that most of the hjs in the rv sample do not transit , and their radii are unknown ; even their true masses are unknown",
    ". we must nevertheless assign them radii in our simulations .",
    "we do so by assigning each planet a random orbital orientation ( uniform in @xmath99 ) and calculating the planet mass @xmath100 based on the measured value of @xmath101 .",
    "then we calculate @xmath14 using the relations between planetary mass , radius , and incident flux @xmath102 presented by @xcite .",
    "we also add gaussian random deviates to @xmath14 to account for the scatter in the @xmath103 relation ( @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 for smaller @xmath100 ) .",
    "the result for the number of expected detections in the 47  tuc survey is @xmath107 .",
    "this is larger than our _ kepler_-based results and compatible with the original estimate of @xcite .",
    "the difference is mainly due to the higher @xmath108 of the rv sample , with a smaller contribution from somewhat higher detectability ( larger planets ) .",
    "the rv - based result has a higher statistical uncertainty than our _ kepler_-based result .",
    "there are a few additional reasons to attach greater weight to the _ kepler_-based result .",
    "the rv sample was constructed _",
    "post facto _ from stars originally selected for undocumented reasons .",
    "@xcite performed an independent rv - based analysis of similar stars , finding 5  hjs within a sample of 822 stars ( see their sec .",
    "4.2 ) , and giving @xmath109 .",
    "this is half the value reported by @xcite , and within 1@xmath2 of the _ kepler_-based result .",
    "table 1 of @xcite reports a higher rate of 0.89% , but this includes planets with masses as low as 0.16  @xmath110 and periods @xmath11111  days rather than 10  days . we do not know why the seemingly more arbitrary upper limit of 11 days was chosen , illustrating the difficulty of analyzing _ post facto _ samples .",
    "furthermore , our method is more direct by associating real planets and their properties to 47  tuc stars , rather than inferring an occurrence rate for a certain sharply - defined category of planets from one survey , and then using that rate to interpret the results from a different survey .",
    "a separate issue is that the rv surveys do not provide much information about the range of stellar masses ( 0.568 - 0.876  @xmath63 ) spanned by the 47  tuc stars .",
    "the rv sample of @xcite includes only one hj in that mass range , causing a large poisson uncertainty in the occurrence rate .",

    "both of these results lead to a lower degree of confidence that the planet populations are different than was originally thought .",
    "the null result reported by @xcite remains the best constraint on the planet occurrence in globular clusters ever obtained , and suggests that close - in giant planets are rarer in 47  tuc than in the field , but with a low statistical significance .",
    "we are therefore still far from understanding the planet population within globular clusters , and what might cause it to differ from that of other types of stars .",
