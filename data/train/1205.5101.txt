    "since their discovery in the radio band more than 40 years ago , pulsars have now been firmly detected in all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum , from radio through optical , x - ray and eventually high - energy gamma - rays .",
    "recently the crab was even detected in very - high energies by veritas  @xcite and magic  @xcite .",
    "although the radio emission mechanism remains poorly understood , the mev - gev pulsed emission puts severe constraints on the high - energy counterpart radiation models . the new catalog of gamma - ray pulsars obtained by the fermi - lat instrument @xcite increased the number of gamma - ray pulsars from seven to about fifty . since then , new pulsars are discovered regularly , more than hundred are listed nowadays  @xcite .",
    "this allows for the first time a reasonable statistical analysis of the high - energy emission properties of these objects like spectral shapes , cut - off energies , and comparison between radio and gamma - ray radiation if both are available .",
    "it was long suspected that polar cap or outer / slot gaps could explain this emission .",
    "nevertheless , recent fermi observations clearly disfavored the polar cap explanation  @xcite .",
    "some of these gamma - ray pulsars do not significantly show a spectral cut - off around a few gev but rather a significant change in the spectral index of the power law .",
    "moreover magic / veritas detection of the crab above 100 gev seems to rule out outer gap models because the accelerating electric field combined to radiation reaction limited flow renders it difficult to observe photons above a few gev .",
    "the determination of the precise location of the emission regions is still problematic .",
    "the in phase pulsation observed in both gamma - ray and in radio for some millisecond pulsars @xcite furnishes one more apparent contradiction between radio and high - energy emission mechanisms .",
    "do they eventually originate in the same place in the magnetosphere or in the wind ? but why are then some gamma - ray pulsars radio quiet as those seen by @xcite",
    ". we are still far from a consensus on the emission model , be it in the radio band or in gamma - rays .",
    "radio pulses and gamma - ray photons are expected to be produced in different emission sites , probably close to the neutron star surface for the former , described by a polar cap model @xcite , and in the vicinity of the light - cylinder for the latter , explained by outer gaps @xcite .",
    "recently , gamma - ray light - curves have been computed for a realistic magnetospheric model based on 3d mhd simulations of the near pulsar magnetosphere @xcite . in this model , gamma rays",
    "are expected close to the light - cylinder .",
    "an alternative site for the production of pulsed radiation has been investigated a few years ago by  .",
    "this model is based on the striped pulsar wind , originally introduced by @xcite .",
    "emission from the striped wind originates outside the light cylinder and relativistic beaming effects are responsible for the phase coherence of this radiation    in this paper , we show that the pulsed high - energy emission up to a few gev as observed by fermi / lat can be explained by synchrotron radiation emanating from the relativistically hot current sheet present in the pulsar striped wind .",
    "our approach follows the study done by who included possible pair creation which are discarded in the present work .",
    "[ sec : modele ] describes the dynamics and geometry of the relativistic plasma flow as well as the radiation model",
    ". then sec .",
    "[ sec : resultat ] derives some important constraints on the bulk lorentz factor of the wind , the pair multiplicity factor , the magnetization parameter as well as a criterion for gamma - ray pulsar detection .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "synchrotron emission from the striped wind applies successfully to the pulsed optical polarization properties of the crab pulsar  @xcite .",
    "our aim is to extend to the highest possible energies the synchro - photons emanating from the current sheet . in the present work ,",
    "we are not concerned with the phase - resolved emission nor in the polarization properties , but we only focus on the average gamma - ray features of the fermi / lat detected pulsars depending on two fundamental observables : the period  @xmath2 of the pulsar and its first derivative  @xmath11 .",
    "we emphasize that this two - parameter family of model remains very restrictive and will not be able to explain in detail each individual pulsar . indeed , the mechanisms occurring in the current sheet are far from being understood , as they involve micro - physics that has not yet been addressed self - consistently and linked to the overall structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere and wind .",
    "nevertheless , as we will show , our model is able to reproduce qualitatively and quantitatively the full set of fermi data with reasonable accuracy .",
    "the derived parameters such as wind lorentz factor , pair multiplicity and magnetization are consistent with values obtained from other independent considerations , giving us confidence in our description of the emission mechanism .      at the heart of any pulsar emission model , be it radio , optical or x - rays / gamma - rays , there is a ( possibly relativistic ) plasma flowing in a strongly magnetized field , preferentially within the magnetosphere for the polar cap and slot / outer gaps .",
    "contrary to these models , we assume that the pulsed emission is produced within the current sheet of the striped wind , thus well outside the magnetosphere , a place where the magnetic configuration switches from poloidal dominant to toroidal dominant .",
    "the plasma in this current sheet is the crucial ingredient in our model .",
    "it is embedded in a mostly non emitting cold plasma .",
    "more precisely , the striped wind flow is made of two distinct parts , namely    * a cold and strongly magnetized plasma of particle density number @xmath12 and lorentz factor @xmath13 , as measured in the lab frame .",
    "note that @xmath13 corresponds to the bulk lorentz factor of the whole striped wind structure .",
    "this part of the wind does not radiate significantly . * a hot and tenuous but weakly magnetized plasma of particle density number @xmath14 occupying a fraction @xmath15 of the wavelength of the wind @xmath16 , also measured in the lab frame .",
    "the fraction of hot plasma is negligible with respect to the cold part , i.e.  @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the light - cylinder radius , @xmath19 the wind speed normalized to the speed of light  @xmath20 and @xmath21 the stellar rotation rate .    later on",
    ", it will be useful to deal with the proper densities and proper lengths given by @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "proper quantities in the rest frame of the wind are always primed except for thermodynamical quantities such as pressure and temperature which are meaningful only in the proper frame .",
    "furthermore , we assume that pairs are created within the magnetosphere and cool down quickly before reaching the wind zone .",
    "therefore , they exclusively replenish the cold part of the striped wind . acceleration and heating of particles occurs once in the stripe and not before .",
    "this is clearly an additional source of energy , a kind of magnetic luminosity , independent of the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar .",
    "therefore , rotational kinetic energy is spent to produce relativistic leptons with a curvature radiation reaction limited lorentz factor of about @xmath25 .",
    "they will cool down in the magnetized part of the wind because of magnetic field strength around the light - cylinder higher than @xmath26 according to fermi / lat first pulsar catalog @xcite .",
    "indeed , the synchrotron cooling time @xmath27 is much less than the period of a pulsar . in the most unfavored case ,",
    "radiation losses are still such that @xmath28 .",
    "thus , our model can apply irrespective of the period of the pulsar , millisecond or normal .",
    "although the hot plasma is much less populated than the cool part , it radiates significantly more because of its relativistic temperature . indeed , to ensure a quasi - stationary equilibrium state , magnetic pressure outside the stripe has to be compensated by gaseous pressure inside the current sheet .",
    "thus in the wind frame , pressure balance implies @xmath29 @xmath30 is the electron rest mass and @xmath31 vacuum permeability .",
    "we recall that the magnetic field is essentially toroidal in the wind zone , a lorentz boost thus gives @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 being the magnetic field strength at the light - cylinder .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath35 can be deduced from considerations about the dynamics in the current sheet as explained in the next paragraph ( see eq.([eq : gamma_max ] ) ) , leading to the knowledge of the density of the hot plasma  @xmath36 as given by the pressure balance eq .",
    "( [ eq : equilibre_pression ] ) .",
    "the bulk kinetic energy of the wind is extracted from the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar .",
    "noting  @xmath7 the efficiency coefficient of rotational to particle energy conversion , the plasma kinetic energy density is @xmath37 note that we neglect the contribution of the hot component because @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the spin - down luminosity and @xmath40 the neutron star moment of inertia .",
    "moreover , the cold plasma density is related to the pair creation rate  @xmath41 ( particles generated per second ) by @xmath42 where the contribution from both poles are taken into account and @xmath43 @xmath4 is the usual pair multiplicity factor , @xmath44 the absolute value of the charge of an electron , @xmath45 the vacuum permittivity , @xmath46 the stellar surface magnetic field intensity and @xmath47 the neutron star radius . inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : ndot ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_v_lsd ] ) , we found a relation between @xmath48 and  @xmath7 such that @xmath49 a similar relation holds for the magnetization defined by @xmath50 .",
    "the magnetization parameter is approximately the inverse of the efficiency coefficient , i.e. @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the pulsar obliquity and assuming the force - free spin - down luminosity of @xcite and confirmed by @xcite .",
    "this reduces the number of independent parameters in the model .",
    "as expected , the fraction of spin - down luminosity converted into particles remains weak @xmath53 as long as the magnetization parameter remains large @xmath54 .",
    "it is usually claimed that the total gamma - ray luminosity should not exceed the spin - down luminosity .",
    "actually , this assertion only holds if the rotation of the neutron star is the unique source of energy",
    ". another non negligible reservoir could be the magnetic field itself .",
    "we will indeed assume that part of the radiation is due to magnetic reconnection within the current sheet .",
    "this will alleviate the restriction @xmath55 although the model not necessarily violates this condition .",
    "it will be checked a posteriori .",
    "particles in the sheet lose energy due to synchrotron cooling .",
    "however , a stationary state in the wind frame can be reached if particles re - energize by acceleration in a reconnecting magnetic field configuration .",
    "the key parameter is the collisionless reconnection rate , @xmath56 .",
    "it will be constrained from spectral features of the fermi / lat data .",
    "this means that the induced electric field re - accelerating particles is of the order @xmath57 .",
    "equaling the synchrotron cooling timescale with the acceleration timescale in the reconnection layer , we find that the maximum lorentz factor of the leptons ( we use primed quantity to express the fact that they are evaluated in the wind frame ) is @xmath58 basically , it depends on the magnetic field strength at the light cylinder and on the distance to the centre of the pulsar . for these lorentz factors ,",
    "the typical energy of a synchrotron photons as seen in the wind frame is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the quantum magnetic field .",
    "thus the synchro - photon energy does only depend linearly on the reconnection rate .",
    "interestingly the photon lies in the mev band because @xmath61 . back to the lab frame",
    ", the photon is boosted by a lorentz factor at most @xmath62 thus @xmath63 according to the fermi / lat catalog @xcite , the cut - off energy lies in the range 0.2 - 8  gev . in our model",
    ", we interpret this cut - off more properly as a break in the spectral energy distribution .",
    "to make the idea more precise , think about an inverse compton spectrum evolving from the thomson regime to the klein - nishina regime .",
    "there is a break in the power law entailing precious information on the underlying emitting plasma . here",
    ", the break is a consequence of the rapid cooling of electrons more energetic than @xmath64 . using a fiducial value of @xmath65",
    ", we see that the lorentz factor of the wind should be around @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "we emphasize that the estimates given here should be understood as orders of magnitude roughly within a factor 10 .",
    "more confidently we expect @xmath67 $ ] as will be shown from the observations .",
    "moreover , the reliability of the value of the cut - off energy is probably doubtful at least for the most energetic pulsars like the crab if not for almost the whole sample of gamma - ray pulsars .      in the frame of the current sheet , relativistic particles in the hot component",
    "radiate synchrotron power at a rate @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the magnetic energy density in the wind frame .",
    "the total emissivity of the hot plasma , assuming isotropy is @xmath70 where @xmath71 . by lorentz transformation and using relativistic invariants , the total synchrotron luminosity , boosted to the observer frame ( expected to be interpreted as the gamma - ray luminosity ) is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the bulk lorentz factor of the wind , @xmath74 the thickness of the current sheet in fraction of the wavelength  @xmath75 , and @xmath76 sets the minimum distance where emission starts ( in the region @xmath77 ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_v_kappa_eta ] ) , we get @xmath78 knowing the synchrotron luminosity eq .",
    "( [ eq : l_syn2 ] ) and the relations  ( [ eq : gamma_v_kappa_eta ] ) and  ( [ eq : sigmaeta ] ) , we are able to deduce important constraints on the fundamental parameters . theoretically , for fixed @xmath79 , our model predicts @xmath80 .",
    "in this paragraph , we discuss the implication of the striped synchrotron model and the latest fermi / lat detections and give explicit values for the most relevant parameters of pulsar magnetosphere and wind theories .      it is possible to relate @xmath13 to the pair multiplicity  @xmath4 and to the magnetization  @xmath5 . according to the second source catalog  ( 2fgl ) @xcite , a good fit of the whole sample of gamma - ray pulsars following the formal dependence as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ eq : l_syn2 ] ) thus with respect to @xmath81 is @xmath82 the constant of proportionality comes from fermi / lat data and will be compared to the factor in front of @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l_syn2 ] ) .",
    "note that the integral energy flux above 100  mev from 2fgl and distances from atnf are subject to several sources of uncertainties @xcite .",
    "this reflects into the derived quantities such as @xmath83 for which the same remarks hold .",
    "we also used a beaming factor of  1 . thanks to the above fit , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) , and to the relation ( [ eq : l_syn2 ] ) , we get @xmath84 . adopting typical values of @xmath85 , @xmath86 ,",
    "the relation between pair multiplicity and efficiency becomes @xmath87 . from this",
    ", we immediately deduce the bulk lorentz factor of the wind @xmath88 it is proportional to the square root of the spin - down luminosity . by comparison between the cut - off energies observed by fermi / lat and the prediction eq .",
    "( [ eq : cutoff ] ) , we can constrain the reconnection rate for each pulsar such that @xmath89 the reconnection rate is about unity for low @xmath1 pulsars such as the millisecond ones .",
    "this might be possible if the background pair density is about  1% of the current sheet particle density number @xcite .",
    "we suspect magnetic dissipation to reach its maximal possible value for those pulsars with @xmath90 whereas @xmath56 decreases monotonically down to  0.01 for the brightest pulsars with @xmath91 .",
    "this splits the gamma - ray pulsars population into two groups , a first with reconnection pushed to its highest limit and a second with less drastic reconnection rate .",
    "moreover , the photon spectral indexes founded by fermi / lat fall in the range @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "this is consistent with a synchrotron spectrum emanating from a power law distribution of leptons with @xmath93 $ ] and @xmath94 .",
    "this could be explained by a relativistic kinetic reconnection process , either very localized close to the x - point where it is found that @xmath95 , or on a global scale , within an extended region such as a simulation box for pic simulations @xcite where @xmath96 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the kinetic reconnection processes is out of the scope of this letter but see @xcite .",
    "detailed knowledge of the particle distribution functions within the current sheet awaits extensive pic simulations with radiation effects included @xcite .",
    "the results of our model concerning the expectation about the gamma - ray luminosity are summarized in the plot fig .",
    "[ fig : luminosite ] .",
    "we show the gamma - ray luminosity versus the spin - down luminosity for a large sample of gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "the predicted luminosity , blue triangles , is overlapped to the fermi / lat data , red points .",
    "although not explicitly imposed by our model and actually not required , the gamma - ray luminosity nevertheless satisfies @xmath97 .     versus spin - down luminosity  @xmath1 .",
    "fermi observations are depicted by red points whereas the predicted luminosity is presented by blue triangles .",
    "the magenta line corresponds to the law @xmath98 , the green line to @xmath99 and the cyan line to the best fit eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit]).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      gamma - ray emitters are identified as pulsars because of their very stable clock . in our model , pulsation is a consequence of the combination of relativistic beaming and striped wind structure .",
    "therefore , we expect to observe mev - gev pulsed emission only if the stripe survives the destructive influence of magnetic dissipation due to reconnection . assuming as a first approximation that the stripe resembles a relativistic harris current sheet , a stationary equilibrium can exist only if the drift speed of the leptons within the sheet is less than the speed of light .",
    "this is actually a criterion for reconnection as explained in @xcite . in the wind frame ,",
    "the drift speed is given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the proper larmor radius .",
    "replacing the bulk lorentz factor of the wind by the approximate relation eq .",

    "the average parameters @xmath106 may also be slightly different of those from normal pulsars . the absence of pulsation does not imply that the underlying neutron star is not a gamma - ray emitter , it just says that it will not be seen as a gamma - ray pulsar .",
