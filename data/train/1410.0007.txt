    "most of our knowledge of the stellar populations of galaxies comes from fitting stellar population synthesis models to their integrated light , as it is prohibitively difficult to characterize individual stars outside of the local volume .",
    "these models are commonly used to measure the total stellar masses of galaxies , as well as their ages , elemental abundances , star formation rates , dust content , stellar initial mass function , and other properties ( see the reviews by walcher et  al .",
    "2011 ; conroy 2013 , and references therein ) .",
    "many of the model ingredients carry significant uncertainties , which translate into uncertainties in derived stellar population parameters .",
    "the uncertainties in derived masses , star formation rates , and other parameters can be @xmath3dex or more ( see , e.g. , conroy , gunn , & white 2009 ; mitchell et  al . 2013 ) .",
    "= 16.5 cm    the predictions of stellar population synthesis models have historically been tested with star clusters , as stellar population parameters derived from the integrated light can be compared to those derived from the distribution of stars in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ; bruzual & charlot 2003 ; maraston 2005 ; schiavon 2007 ; conroy et  al .",
    "2009 ; thomas , johansson , & maraston 2011 ; nol et  al .",
    "in fact , models are frequently tuned and calibrated to fit available data from open clusters in the milky way and the magellanic clouds , as well as the ancient , and generally metal - poor , globular clusters .",
    "thanks to programs such as the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury ( angst ; dalcanton et al .",
    "2009 ) , some tests can now be done using individual stars in galaxies out to @xmath4mpc ( see , e.g. , girardi et al .",
    "2010 ) .    despite advances like these",
    ", the performance of the models remains essentially untested in important regions of parameter space . among the most important regimes",
    "is that of the metal - rich , old stellar populations which dominate the light of massive early - type galaxies . correctly modeling these stellar populations",
    "is critical for many aspects of astrophysics ; examples are the high mass end of the galaxy mass function ( croton et  al .",
    "2006 ) and the core mass function ( van dokkum et al .  2014 ) , the masses of central black holes ( van der marel et  al .",
    "1998 ) , the production of atomic elements in the universe ( worthey , faber , & gonzalez 1992 ; conroy , graves , & van dokkum 2014 ) , the stellar initial mass function ( van dokkum & conroy 2010 ; conroy & van dokkum 2012b ) , and the physical conditions in the densest star forming regions in the early universe ( krumholz 2011 ; nelson et al .  2014 ) .",
    "unfortunately , star clusters in the local group with similar ages and abundance patterns as giant ellipticals are rare ( e.g. , caldwell et  al .",
    "2011 ; van dokkum & conroy 2011 ) .",
    "we therefore largely rely on a combination of milky way stars and theoretical models to fit the spectra of these galaxies .",
    "of particular concern are the red giants that dominate the near - ir light .",
    "the spectra of these stars have strong and ubiquitous molecular bands of titanium - oxide ( tio ) and h@xmath5o , which often coincide with spectral features that are used to constrain abundances , ages , and the imf ( see , e.g. , lanon & wood 2000 ; rayner , cushing , & vacca 2009 ) .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new method to test the predictions of stellar population synthesis models for old , unresolved stellar populations .",
    "the method makes use of the fact that giants are sufficiently rare and luminous that poisson fluctuations in their number cause pixel - to - pixel fluctuations in the surface brightness distribution of nearby early - type galaxies .",
    "the existence of these surface brightness fluctuations is well known , and they have been used extensively to measure distances to galaxies : if a galaxy is closer , there are less giant stars in each pixel , and the pixel - to - pixel poisson fluctuations around the mean will therefore be larger ( e.g. , tonry & schneider 1988 ; tonry et  al . 2001 ; mei et  al .",
    "2005 ; blakeslee et  al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "pixels with high and low fluctuations allow us to do an experiment that gives unique information : we can study how the integrated spectrum changes when giants are added or subtracted to the galaxy .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ demo.fig ] , which shows the different stellar content of pixels with low and high fluctuations .",
    "the bright pixel at bottom left has many more luminous giants than the faint pixel at bottom right ; therefore , comparing spectra of pixels with different brightness enables us , in principle , to isolate spectral features of stars on the upper giant branch .",
    "furthermore , in the regime of very large fluctuations there will be pixels ( or more appropriately , lines of sight through the galaxy ) whose light has only a small contribution from luminous stars on the rgb and agb .",
    "spectroscopy of these pixels can provide information on the integrated light of stars that are still on the main sequence , which is difficult to access in any other way .",
    "this method builds on previous studies that compared the fluctuation amplitude in various broad - band filters to predictions from stellar population synthesis models ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ; vazdekis et  al . 1997 ; blakeslee , vazdekis , & ajhar 2001 ; liu , graham , & charlot 2002 ; jensen et  al .",
    "a central conceptual difference with previous work is that we do not use the absolute fluctuation signal in the analysis , which is difficult to measure ( as it requires an accurate distance , a thorough knowledge of the effects of the psf , and a careful treatment of contaminating objects ) .",
    "instead , the method relies on the relative change in the spectrum @xmath6 for a given relative change in the total flux @xmath7 .",
    "this is a key strength of the method : the distance , psf , and other effects that determine the absolute amplitude of the fluctuations are only relevant in that they set the dynamic range that is probed with the data .",
    "a second difference is that we identify the fluctuations of individual pixels rather than their statistical ensemble .",
    "here we take a first step toward fluctuation spectroscopy by using imaging through the narrow - band ramp filters in the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) of hst .",
    "we study a regime where the observed fluctuations are dominated by systematic changes in the tio absorption strength with temperature on the upper giant branch .",
    "the target is , the most luminous galaxy in the virgo cluster ( with the possible exception of m87  depending on the chosen aperture ) .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to introduce fluctuation spectroscopy as a method to dissect unresolved stellar populations .",
    "we also constrain certain aspects of the stellar synthesis model , and we show that more complete tests are possible with future data sets .",

    "we used the ramp filters in the acs camera to obtain images of the galaxy at six different wavelengths .",
    "the ramp filters transmit in a narrow optical bandpass , whose central wavelength can be tuned by rotating the filter .",
    "each filter consists of three segments , which are projected on different parts of the wfc detector array .",
    "the choice of segment ( and therefore the location of the image on the detector ) depends on the desired wavelength : within each segment only a limited range of wavelengths can be chosen .",
    "the six filters we used are listed in table [ obs.tab ] .",
    "their transmission curves , calculated with the synphot package , are shown in fig .",
    "[ filters.fig ] .",
    "the widths of the filters range from @xmath8  for the bluest filter to @xmath9  for the reddest , corresponding to a ( sparsely sampled ) spectral resolution ranging from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the transmission curves are compared to a model spectrum of an old stellar population ( conroy & van dokkum 2012a ) , redshifted to 997and smoothed to a velocity dispersion of 300 .",
    "the central wavelengths were chosen to measure three redshifted spectral features that are important indicators of the imf : the nai @xmath12 doublet , the strongest calcium triplet line caii @xmath13 , and the feh @xmath14 wing - ford band ( e.g. , van dokkum & conroy 2011 ) .",
    "for each of these features we observed an `` on '' band and an `` off '' band , leading to six narrow - band filters . however , as we show later , the observed pixel - to - pixel variation in these bands in our data is actually _ not _ caused by variation in these absorption features , but by systematic changes in the tio absorption strength on the upper giant branch ( see  [ model.sec ] ) . to avoid confusion",
    "we do not refer to these filters as , for example , `` nai on '' and `` nai off '' , even though that was how they were designed ; instead , we use names that simply refer to the central wavelength ( see table [ obs.tab ] ) .",
    "four of the wavelengths fall in the fr853n bandpass , which is part of the inner segment of its ramp filter unit .",

    "these broad - band images are critical as they have sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) to accurately measure the flux in each pixel , and therefore the contribution of giants to that pixel relative to its neighboring pixels .",
    "the narrow - band data do not have sufficiently high s / n for this measurement , but that is not needed : if it is known which pixels have high fluctuations and which pixels have low fluctuations , we can select the giant - rich and giant - poor pixels in the narrow - band data and average them to increase the s / n ratio . for this to work",
    "the broad - band data and narrow - band data have to be astrometrically - matched with an accuracy of @xmath17 pixel . in order to limit astrometric and resampling errors we observed  twice in the broad - band f814w filter : once using the iramp pointing origin and once using the oramp pointing origin .",

    "the data were taken in nine visits : two visits for f995n and one visit for all other bands .",
    "we registered the f823n , f836n , f856n , f880n , and the iramp f814w images to a common reference frame .",
    "the shifts between these images are small ( @xmath18pixels ) , as they all use the same pointing origin .",

    "we used the f814w image as a reference frame but first shifted it by @xmath19 , @xmath20 pixels .",
    "this non - integer shift ensures that the broad - band and narrow - band data are interpolated in the same way .",
    "we used a third - order polynomial for the interpolation to the reference grid .",
    "the f980n , f995n , and oramp f814w images were also aligned with each other , using the same procedure . for f995n the two visits were aligned and then added .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) in the images needs to be exactly matched , as any differences will influence the measured signal in the ratio of two bands .",
    "we measured the width of the psf by fitting gaussians to point sources in the field in each band .",
    "it turns out that the width of the f814w psf is identical ( to within @xmath21 pixel ) to the f880n psf , but that the fwhm of the psfs in all other bands is narrower by @xmath22 pixels .",
    "it is not clear why the f880n psf behaves differently from the other ramp filters .",
    "we convolved the images to the f814w psf , and verified that the psfs were identical to @xmath21 pixel after the convolution .",
    "images of the eight observations ( the six ramp filters and the f814w images in each of the two apertures ) are shown in fig.[filter_im.fig ] .",
    "in order to determine the variation in a pixel we first need to know what the flux in that pixel would be in the absence of fluctuations .",

    "the fits were done in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "only known bad and missing pixels were masked in the fit .",
    "this initial fit was subtracted from the galaxy , and strongly deviating pixels in the residual image ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 adus@xmath25 ) were added to the bad pixel mask .",
    "these deviating pixels are mostly at the locations of foreground stars and globular clusters , but also include some bad pixels that were not included in the data quality file . in the second step",
    "the fit was improved by adding these flagged pixels to the bad pixel mask .",
    "the surface brightness fluctuation in each pixel was determined in the following way .",
    "first , a conservative mask was created that includes all pixels that might be dominated or influenced by globular clusters or stars . in the inner regions of the galaxy",
    "these objects were identified by dividing the image by the smooth model , as the relative fluctuations in the center are typically @xmath26% ( see below ) .",
    "pixels in the central @xmath27 that deviate by more than 5% from the smooth model were identified as potential objects . at larger radii",
    "this is not a viable method as the surface brightness fluctuations approach these levels , and we identified contaminating objects by subtracting the model from the galaxy .",
    "away from the central regions , pixels deviating from the model by more than 0.5 counts / s were flagged as potential globular clusters .",
    "careful inspection of the residual images showed that the combined mask correctly identifies all `` visible '' globular clusters , stars , and background galaxies .",
    "the method identifies the central parts of such objects but not their faint wings , and the final mask was created by convolving the combined inner + outer mask with a @xmath28 pixel tophat .    after creating the iramp and oramp masks the f814w images were divided by the smooth 2d models of the light distribution .",
    "pixels flagged in the object masks were set to zero .",
    "the resulting residual images contain the surface brightness fluctuations but also low level , large scale variation caused by subtle differences between the surface brightness distribution of the galaxy and the ellipse fit models .",
    "this large scale variation was removed using unsharp masking : the residual images were median filtered with a @xmath29 pixel mask , and divided by these heavily smoothed versions of themselves . the quantity `` surface brightness fluctuation '' , or",
    "`` sbf '' , in this paper refers to the fluxes in these residual images .",
    "the sbf of a pixel @xmath30 is therefore defined as sbf=@xmath31 , with @xmath32 the flux of a 2d model of ngc4472 that is constrained to fit the observed f814w surface brightness distribution of the galaxy exactly on @xmath33 scales .",

    "the iramp and oramp observations are entirely independent of each other : the two sets of exposures are independent and the galaxy is exposed on a different detector .",
    "nevertheless , the fluctuation pattern in the iramp and oramp data is identical , which means that the pattern is dominated by signal , rather than noise .",
    "the variation is highly correlated : clumps of pixels vary together .",
    "this in itself shows that the pattern is unlikely to be noise , as that is ( mostly ) uncorrelated in acs data .",

    "we find that the amplitude of the fluctuations is reduced by a factor of 4.2 ; that is , in actual acs images the surface brightness fluctuations are smaller by a factor of @xmath4 compared to an imaginary telescope which projects delta functions on a perfect detector with @xmath34 pixels . for reference ,",

    "the amplitude of the fluctuations increases with distance from the galaxy center .",
    "the fluctuations are proportional to @xmath41 , with @xmath42 the average number of giant stars in a pixel , which means that the absolute amplitude of the fluctuations is proportional to the square root of the surface brightness .",

    "this simple expectation fits the observations well ( see tonry & schneider 1988 ) .",
    "the small asymmetry in the observed distributions may be partially caused by faint globular clusters and background galaxies .",
    "for the main analysis in the following sections we select all @xmath44 pixels with model surface brightness @xmath45magarcsec@xmath46 .",
    "in contrast to previous studies we are not concerned with an absolute calibration of the surface brightness fluctuation signal . the goal of this study is to measure the spectral variation as a function of the surface brightness fluctuation , that is , to determine by how much the spectrum of a pixel changes for a given change in its brightness .",
    "this relative nature of the method is an important aspect , as it makes the analysis independent of the distance of the galaxy , the effects of the psf , and other effects that determine the amplitude of the fluctuation signal .",
    "as discussed earlier , the only requirement is that the psf and astrometry of the narrow - band observations are matched to those of the broad - band observations .",
    "we measure the spectral variation by dividing adjacent narrow - band filters .",
    "four filter combinations are used : f823n",
    "/ f836n , f836n / f856n , f856n / f880n , and f980n / f995n . for each of these combinations an `` index image ''",
    "was created by taking the ratio of the two adjacent narrow - band images .",
    "these index images were normalized by dividing by the median value of the index . in principle , the images now contain the relative index variation , with respect to a median index value that is identical to 1 , for each pixel ( in addition to noise ) .",
    "however , the median is not exactly 1 in the entire image , due to relative errors in flat fielding and a possible contribution from real large scale spatial variation in the index . as we are interested only in the relative fluctuations in the indices and not in their absolute values , we divided the index images by a `` correction flat '' that contains this large scale variation .",
    "this correction flat was created by filtering the index images with a median filter of @xmath29 pixels .",
    "the peak - to - peak variation in the correction flats is @xmath47% .",
    "the s / n ratio in the index images is much lower than in the f814w images , due to the much smaller width of the ramp filters . the typical per - pixel measurement uncertainty in the radial range of interest ranges from 0.025  0.06 , depending on the index . as we will show later , the indices need to be measured with an accuracy of @xmath48 to constrain model parameters  two orders of magnitude better than the per - pixel uncertainty .",
    "fortunately , we can obtain the required s / n ratio by binning : as we have a precise measurement of the surface brightness fluctuation of each pixel from the f814w images , we can average all pixels in the index images that are known to have a particular fluctuation .",
    "this procedure is demonstrated for the f836n / f856n index in fig .",
    "[ sbf_raw.fig ] .",
    "the rms scatter in individual index measurements ( the @xmath49 width of the histograms ) is @xmath50 .",
    "nevertheless , in each surface brightness fluctuation bin the average index value can be determined with an uncertainty of only @xmath51 ( not including systematic errors ) , due to the large number of pixels that is averaged .",
    "we experimented with different averaging methods and chose the biweight ( beers , flynn , & gebhardt 1990 ) , as it is both robust and insensitive to outliers . using",
    "the median instead leads to nearly indistinguishable results .",
    "we also explored whether the results depend on the radius from the center of the galaxy , the flat fielding , sky subtraction , and errors in the shifts .",
    "the systematic error due to these effects is estimated at 0.0005 , that is , 0.05% .",

    "qualitatively , this means that the model passes an important test in a previously unexplored regime .",
    "it also means that we know what the most luminous stars in elliptical galaxies are : giants with temperatures @xmath126k and luminosities @xmath127l@xmath75 .",
    "their spectra are well understood , even to the extent that our default model with the  abundance pattern is a significantly better match to the data than a `` standard '' @xmath58enhanced model with [ @xmath128fe]=0.3 .",
    "understanding stars with @xmath89l@xmath75 is important as they comprise @xmath129% of the bolometric luminosity of old stellar populations , and their strong tio spectral features coincide with the imf - sensitive features nai and feh .",
    "we stress , however , that our data do not provide information on lower luminosity stars , or on the absolute number of luminous giants ( see  5.1.3 ) .",
    "we have tested various perturbations of our default model .",
    "the most important result is that we can quantitatively constrain the contribution of late m giants to the integrated light .",
    "such stars are not expected to exist in substantal numbers in old stellar populations , but their presence can not easily be ruled out based on integrated light analysis .",
    "importantly , leaving the contribution of these stars as a free parameter in fitting stellar populations can lead to degeneracies with the derived stellar initial mass function , as several tio bands overlap with imf - sensitive features ( see  5.2 in conroy & van dokkum 2012b ) . here we show that , for this particular galaxy , they can not contribute more than 3% to the integrated light .    taking the stellar templates and isochrones",
    "as a given , we have explored the dependence of the observed ramp filter data on stellar population parameters . in the regime of small fluctuations",
    "the data are insensitive to the imf , but they provide constraints on metallicity and age . in particular , the fluctuation spectra are quite sensitive to age , as the number of late m giants with strong tio features drops sharply at very old ages .",
    "it is generally difficult to distinguish stellar populations that are between 10 and 13 gyr old , and fluctuation spectroscopy is probably among the most sensitive diagnostics in this regime .",
    "the analysis in this paper can be extended in various directions .",
    "the two most obvious ones are to obtain actual spectra rather than narrow - band filter data , and to probe regimes of larger surface brightness fluctuations . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ largefluc.fig ] we can expect qualitative changes in the spectra of fluctuations @xmath104 , as these sightlines offer a relatively unobstructed view of subgiants and the main sequence .",
    "the analysis could center on differential techniques such as those employed in this paper , or on direct modeling of the spectra of very negative fluctuations . in principle",
    ", it should be possible to empirically , and spectroscopically , reconstruct the entire upper rgb of elliptical galaxies  something that is impossible to do in any other way . among other applications ,",
    "this type of analysis should provide strong constraints on the imf ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ largefluc.fig ] ) .",
    "observations with integral - field spectrographs on existing telescopes , particularly when combined with adaptive optics , could provide this kind of information for galaxies within @xmath114mpc .",
    "with jwst and 30 m class telescopes on the ground these studies could be extended to the virgo cluster and beyond .",
    "progress can also be made by combining constraints from fluctuation spectroscopy with those from fits to integrated - light spectra .",
    "the methods provide complementary information , as traditional blue spectra are mostly sensitive to stars near the main sequence turn - off .",
    "we note here that none of the model variations discussed in this paper lead to dramatic ( that is , larger than a few percent ) variations in the integrated - light spectra , with the exception of the models with very young ages . finally , the stellar library can be augmented .",
    "we currently use only 70 distinct templates in our default library , and in some regimes incomplete coverage leads to large `` jumps '' from one template to the other .",
