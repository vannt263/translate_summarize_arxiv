    "kh  15d is a weak - lined t tauri star ( k7v ) in ngc 2264 ( @xmath11 pc ) , which shows deep ( 3.5 mag ) periodic eclipses , each lasting for about 20 days , a large fraction of the 48.36 day period @xcite .",
    "the eclipses occur abruptly , indistinguishable from obscuration by a ` knife edge ' @xcite . during eclipse ,",
    "the lack of reddening in the spectrum @xcite , and polarization which varies only weakly with wavelength @xcite , imply that the obscuring matter must be comprised of large particles .",
    "a consensus view to date is that the eclipses are caused by structure in a protoplanetary disk , fortuitously edge - on to our line of sight .",
    "candidate structures include a density wave @xcite , a vortex @xcite , or a warp in the disk induced by planet - disk interactions @xcite .",
    "the considerable recent interest in kh  15d derives from the diagnostic potential inherent in the eclipse geometry , and the serendipity of finding a protoplanetary system whose structure suggests that planetary formation is actively occurring .",
    "although the eclipses in kh  15d are evidently caused by large solid particles , observations of the gaseous component may help to deduce the nature of the system .",
    "@xcite observed double - peaked atomic hydrogen emission lines , indicative of a bipolar outflow . in this _",
    "letter _ we report the spectroscopic discovery of @xmath1 m molecular hydrogen lines in emission , also showing a double - peaked structure indicative of outflow .",
    "this h@xmath12 emission has been independently discovered by @xcite , by imaging in a narrow - band filter .",
    "molecular hydrogen emission is commonly observed from pre - main sequence objects @xcite , where it can be excited by fluorescence @xcite or by shocks @xcite , and has been well - studied in many cases .",
    "h@xmath12 observations should therefore help to relate kh  15d to other pre - main sequence systems .",
    "we observed kh  15d using the nirspec spectrometer on the keck ii telescope @xcite .",
    "observations on 19 & 26 august 2002 ut used nirspec s low spectral resolution mode , with slit widths of @xmath13 and @xmath14 arc - sec respectively , giving @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "kh  15d was in eclipse on 19 august ( phase @xmath17 , emergence was just beginning ; zero phase is center of eclipse ) , and out of eclipse on 26 august ( phase @xmath18 ) .",
    "noise from the sky background was higher than usual on both nights because the object was observed at high airmass ( @xmath19 ) in pre - dawn conditions , with a rapidly brightening sky .",
    "( kh  15d observations were supplementary to our main program . )",
    "sky subtraction was facilitated by nodding the telescope to well separated ` a ' and ` b ' positions along the slit .",
    "the position angle of the slit ( measured positive eastward from north ) , and total integration time used , were @xmath20 & @xmath21 seconds , and @xmath22 & @xmath23 seconds , on 19 & 26 august , respectively .    on 2 september 2002 ut , kh  15d was out of eclipse ( phase@xmath24 ) .",
    "we observed it using nirspec s high - resolution cross - dispersed mode , giving @xmath25 , with a @xmath26 arc - sec slit width ( 2 pixels ) , in position angle @xmath27 .",
    "total integration time was @xmath28 seconds .",
    "these high resolution observations were made under better sky conditions ( airmass @xmath29 ) , and also used nodding for sky subtraction .",
    "for both the low and high resolution spectra , we observed a neon emission lamp for wavelength calibration and a continuum lamp for flat - fielding .",
    "sky and dark current subtraction was accomplished to first order by subtracting the ` b ' frames from the ` a ' frames , after division by the flat - field lamp frame .",
    "a second - order sky correction was accomplished by subtracting a residual sky spectrum from the average difference frame .",
    "the residual sky spectrum was determined on the average difference frame by summing a region located spatially between the ` a ' and ` b ' positions of the star on the slit .",
    "the kh  15d spectrum was obtained in a standard extraction , by summing both the ` a ' and ` b ' spectra over a region of @xmath30 arc - sec along the slit , after correction for the tilt of the slit .",
    "the wavelength scale was determined by fitting gaussian profiles to 14 neon emission lines in calibration spectra taken immediately following the kh  15d spectra .",
    "the neon rest wavelengths ( from the nirspec manual ) were expressed as a quadratic function of the fitted line positions ( in pixels ) , with coefficients determined by least squares .",
    "the precision of the wavelength calibration , estimated from the scatter in the quadratic fits , is @xmath31 m ( 0.5 pixels ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the low - resolution spectra in and out of eclipse , with the wavelength scale transformed to the stellar frame .",
    "our velocity transformations assume a heliocentric stellar radial velocity of @xmath32 km  sec@xmath8 , intermediate between the two values cited by @xcite .",
    "both figure  1 spectra have been flat - fielded , and normalized to a unit intensity near @xmath33 m . we did not observe a standard flux source , but we were able to use the kh  15d stellar continuum to estimate an absolute line intensity ( see below ) .    the low resolution spectrum during eclipse shows 5 emission lines due to h@xmath12 , as noted on the figure .",
    "even the weakest of these lines , 2 - 1  s(1 ) , is real , which we judged by inspecting the average difference frame prior to spectral extraction . on the difference frame ,",
    "emission in the strongest line , 1 - 0  s(1 ) , has a spatial distribution along the slit which is peaked at the stellar position to within @xmath34 arc - sec ( 1 pixel ) .",
    "this bright emission can be traced beyond the stellar point spread function ( psf ) by at least @xmath35 arc - sec .",
    "there is evidence for faint s(1 ) emission ( intensity @xmath36 of the kh  15d peak ) at one other position along the slit , @xmath37 arc - sec distant from kh  15d .",
    "intensities for the h@xmath12 lines were determined by fitting gaussian profiles .",
    "the widths of the fitted gaussians were all constrained to equal the best - fit width for the 1 - 0  s(1 ) line , since the lines are not spectrally resolved .",
    "errors in the line intensities ( areas under the gaussian fits ) were estimated using a monte - carlo procedure : we repeated the fits many times on ` synthetic ' lines having the same line parameters and noise levels as in the real data .",
    "all of the line intensities and errors are normalized to unit intensity for the 1 - 0  s(1 ) line , and are tabulated in table  1 .",
    "we used the very high spectral resolution atlas of @xcite , convolved to the @xmath38 km sec@xmath8 widths of the lines ( see below ) , and measured the telluric absorption at the doppler - shifted position of each line . at the observed geocentric doppler shift and line width ,",
    "none of the kh  15d lines are coincident with significant telluric lines , hence any telluric corrections are negligible , even at 2 airmasses .    the weakness of the 2 - 1  s(1 ) line is indicative of thermal excitation , since models of fluorescent emission predict an intensity for this line of @xmath39 relative to the 1 - 0  s(1 ) line @xcite .",
    "it is clear from figure  1 that the intensity of 2 - 1  s(1 ) is substantially less than half of the 1 - 0  s(1 ) line . to determine the excitation temperature , we computed ln@xmath40 where @xmath41 is the table  1 line intensity",
    ", @xmath42 is the upper level statistical weight , and @xmath43 is the einstein a - value . for optically thin emission , ln@xmath40 is proportional to the energy of the emitting level , with constant of proportionality @xmath44 .",
    "we adopted the line parameters tabulated by @xcite , and calculated @xmath45 by least squares .",
    "the relative intensities expected from thermal excitation at @xmath46 are tabulated in table  1 for comparison .",
    "the differences between these values and the observed intensities are somewhat greater than our estimated observational errors , but not so discrepant as to contradict thermal excitation .",
    "figure  1 shows that the emission line contrast is greatly reduced out of eclipse , similar to the effect seen in atomic emission lines by @xcite . in the presence of shot noise from the stellar continuum , observation of the emission lines outside of eclipse",
    "is problematic at low spectral resolution .",
    "but the contrast for unresolved emission lines is proportional to spectral resolution , and we have been able to measure the 1 - 0  s(1 ) line in high resolution spectra outside of eclipse .",
    "our high resolution spectra were extracted from an average difference image in a manner similar to the low - resolution spectra . however",
    ", the high - resolution spectra did not require a second order sky subtraction , and we used night sky emission lines for wavelength calibration .",
    "a velocity ( wavelength ) precision of @xmath47 km sec@xmath8 ( 0.4 pixels ) was achieved by using four night sky lines , two on each side of the 1 - 0  s(1 ) line , with vacuum wavelengths from @xcite .",
    "we adopted the precise vacuum wavelength ( @xmath48 m ) of the 1 - 0  s(1 ) line from @xcite .",
    "similar to the low resolution in - eclipse spectra , our high resolution spectra also show the emission extending well beyond the stellar psf by @xmath4 arc - sec .",
    "we extracted three high - resolution spectra from the average difference frame , and these spectra are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the first spectrum ( upper portion of figure  2 ) was extracted by summing along the slit within @xmath49 arc - sec of the star .",
    "two other spectra were extracted over the interval @xmath50 arc - sec from the star to the east and west ( lower spectra in figure  2 ) .",
    "we examined the total intensity of the line seen in figure  2 ( top spectrum , near the star ) , compared to the line intensity seen near the star during eclipse . using the stellar continuum as a reference , and adopting an eclipse depth of 3.1 mag at the epoch of the figure  1 spectrum ( phase@xmath17 ; @xcite ) ,",
    "we compute the intensity expected in figure  2 ( out of eclipse ) by scaling the figure  1 ( in eclipse ) line intensity .",
    "since the emission is extended , we allow for the different solid angles ( slit widths times distance summed along the slit ) . on this basis",
    "we expect to see a line intensity about @xmath51 less than is actually observed in figure  2 .",
    "this is certainly within the errors of the observations , and we conclude that the 1 - 0  s(1 ) line intensity is approximately constant , and is not eclipsed . the variation in h@xmath12 emission line contrast can be accounted for ( within the errors ) solely by changes in the stellar brightness .",
    "the line profiles seen in figure  2 show two components .",
    "relative to the reference frame of the star , a blueshifted component appears at @xmath7 km sec@xmath8 , and a redshifted component at @xmath9 km sec@xmath8 . within the errors ,",
    "the redshifted component is consistent with zero velocity .",
    "although the total intensity in the emission is peaked at the stellar position , the relative intensity of the blue- and redshifted components changes abruptly there . east of the star , the blueshifted component dominates , whereas the redshifted component prevails to the west .",
    "the components are relatively narrow , fwhm @xmath52 km sec@xmath8 .",
    "we have estimated the absolute line intensity for the figure  2 spectrum coincident with the stellar position , adding both components . using the @xmath53 magnitude reported by @xcite , and the @xmath54 color normal to a k7 dwarf from @xcite",
    ", we deduce a @xmath55 magnitude for the star of 12.9 , outside of eclipse . adopting the zero - magnitude flux from @xcite , we calculated the line intensity using the stellar continuum as a photometric standard . since the star is a point source , whereas the emission is extended , we corrected for stellar slit - losses .",
    "fitting a gaussian to the spatial profile of the star ( along the slit ) , we derive @xmath56 arc - sec seeing ( fwhm ) . assuming image symmetry , a 2-d calculation indicates @xmath57 loss at the slit ( @xmath26 arc - sec slit width ) .",
    "we thereby derive a line intensity of @xmath58 ergs @xmath59 sec@xmath8 . following the calculation outlined by @xcite for optically thin emission , this implies a mass @xmath60 of hot h@xmath12 , and a column density of @xmath61 molecules @xmath59 .",
    "this is comparable to the hot h@xmath12 mass in the near vicinity of several weak - lined t - tauri stars cited by @xcite , except that we argue for shock - heating by outflow in kh  15d , not uv fluorescence or heating by x - ray flux .",
    "note that the inferred mass is proportional to the square of the source distance , and we have adopted @xmath11 pc . note also ( see below ) that @xcite have imaged an extended jet of s(1 ) emission , and the mass we derive here applies only to the immediate vicinity of the star ( within @xmath62 arc - sec@xmath63 ) .",
    "@xcite have imaged kh  15d in a narrow band filter centered on the 1 - 0 s(1 ) line .",
    "they find a prominent jet starting in close coincidence with the star , and extending many arc - sec to the north .",
    "they have considered whether the jet is physically associated with kh  15d or is a chance superposition ( h@xmath12 emission is common in star - forming regions like ngc 2264 ) .",
    "independent of our spectroscopy , they conclude that the association of the jet with kh  15d is probably physical .",
    "we find that : 1 ) our low resolution spectrum during eclipse shows bright s(1 ) emission centered on the stellar position to @xmath64 arc - sec ( sec .",
    "3.1 ) , and 2 ) our high resolution spectrum resolves the line into two velocity components , whose relative intensities change aburptly at the stellar position ( sec 3.2 )",
    ". therefore our results strongly support the conclusion that s(1 ) emission is physically associated with kh  15d .    recently ,",
    "quiescent h@xmath12 1 - 0  s(1 ) emission has been detected near several t - tauri stars @xcite .",
    "this quiescent emission shows narrow line profiles , just as we see in kh  15d .",
    "we considered the possibility that the kh  15d emission originates from quiescent gas , with doppler shifts resulting from keplerian orbital motion .",
    "we can not exclude that some fraction of the emission , especially in the red component , arises from quiescent emission . nevertheless ,",
    "because the kh  15d emission is spatially extended and shows evidence of outflow , it seems more closely related to the shock - heated h@xmath12 which has been observed in hundreds of young stellar objects , including classical t - tauri stars @xcite .",
    "interpretation of our kh  15d observations requires knowing the stellar radial velocity , and the heliocentric radial velocity we adopt for the system ( @xmath32 km sec@xmath8 ) may be in error if the star is a binary . nevertheless , the double - peaked profiles we observe in the close vicinity of the star suggest outflow . however , a simple picture of a symmetric bipolar jet emergent normal to a single edge - on disk is hard to reconcile with our observations , and with the @xcite imaging . in such a simple interpretation ,",
    "the line - of - sight shock velocity in the 1 - 0 s(1 ) line would have to be at least half of the difference between the red- and blueshifted components , i.e. @xmath65 km sec@xmath8 . for a disk inclination of @xmath66 @xcite",
    ", the flow would be inclined by only @xmath67 to the plane of the sky , so the total shock velocity would have to exceed @xmath68 km sec@xmath8 .",
    "this is well above the velocity where shocked h@xmath12 is observed in other objects ( h@xmath12 becomes dissociated at high shock velocities , @xcite ) . therefore the outflow revealed in molecular hydrogen is likely to be inclined significantly to the plane of the sky .",
    "similar arguments would not apply to lines formed very close to the star , where a bipolar outflow may not be collimated .",
    "however , the emission we observe is spatially resolved from the star , occurring at distances where bipolar outflows are often highly collimated to a single axis .",
    "@xcite find only one bright jet of line emission extending to the north .",
    "since our slit was oriented primarily east - west ( pa @xmath69 ) , we have observed approximately ( but not precisely ) perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "our spectra will reveal the flow pattern in the jet to the extent that the total angle between our slit and the velocity vector differs from @xmath70 .",
    "we believe that our brightest emission component ( blueshifted ` east ' spectrum in figure  2 ) samples the @xcite jet , whereas the red components are consistent with either a possible fainter counter - jet ( not yet detected by imaging ) , or quiescent emission near the stellar velocity .",
    "the extent and complexity of h@xmath12 emission from kh  15d is reminiscent of t  tauri itself , a known binary system .",
    "consistent with its binary nature , t  tauri shows two nearly perpendicular outflow systems @xcite .",
    "our observations are not yet sufficient , in terms of spatial sampling , to say whether kh  15d shows a single , or multiple , velocity systems . mapping spectroscopy of kh  15d in the 1 - 0  s(1 ) line is needed to clarify the kinematics of this interesting object .",
    "we thank tim brown for help with the observations , and the keck support staff , particularly randy campbell and grant hill , for assistance with nirspec .",
    "we are grateful to alan tokunaga and colleagues for communicating and discussing their imaging results , and to an anonymous referee for several helpful comments .",
    "portions of this work were supported by nasa s origins of solar systems program .",
    "the authors wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community .",
