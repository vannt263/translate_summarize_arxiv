    "in the absence of relaxation , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments consist of a sequence of unitary transformations of the density operator representing the spin system of interest @xcite . an important goal of both theoretical and practical interest is the design of pulse sequences that can generate a desired unitary transformation as fast as possible , in order to reduce losses due to relaxation .",
    "this poses the problem of time - optimal control of quantum systems @xcite , which is of interest for coherent spectroscopy in general , as well as for quantum information processing @xcite .    here",
    ", we focus on the realization of effective propagators that correspond to the action of an effective hamiltonian with trilinear coupling terms which simulate a three - spin interaction in spin chains consisting of three weakly coupled spins 1/2 ( ising coupling ) . in the context of nmr polarization - transfer experiments , methods for creating such effective trilininear hamiltonians",
    "have been developed and used for many years @xcite .",
    "one approach to create such effective hamiltonians is based on the decoupling of certain interactions during the pulse sequence @xcite .",
    "an earlier , more efficient approach does not rely on decoupling @xcite .",
    "recently , further improved sequences @xcite were derived which also avoid decoupling .",
    "even larger time savings are possible by using _ geodesic",
    "_ pulse sequences @xcite that can be shown to be time - optimal .",
    "however , so far the geodesic pulse sequences were based on weak rf pulses which severely limited the range of frequency offsets for which the experiment is functional . in order to pave the way for practical applications of these time - optimal pulse elements , we developed broadband versions of the time - optimal geodesic sequence .",
    "time - optimal indirect swap operations @xcite were realized experimentally in a three - spin system , demonstrating the superior performance of the new sequences .",
    "we consider a chain of three heteronuclear spins with coupling constants @xmath2 , @xmath3 and offsets @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . in a multiple - rotating frame @xcite ,",
    "the corresponding free evolution hamiltonian @xmath7 is in general given by    @xmath8    with the coupling term    @xmath9    and the offset term    @xmath10    the same hamiltonian is valid if e.g. the first and third spins are homonuclear and the second spin is heteronuclear ( _ vide infra _ ) .",
    "many applications in nmr spectroscopy @xcite and nmr quantum computing @xcite require unitary transformations of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 can be @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the time @xmath18 required to realize such a propagator depends on the pulse sequence and is a function of @xmath19 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the propagator @xmath20 can also be expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 corresponds to an effective trilinear coupling hamiltonian of the form @xmath23 and the effective trilinear coupling constant @xmath24 is defined by @xmath25    for practical applications , @xmath26 should be as short as possible and hence the effective coupling constant @xmath24 and the scaling factor @xmath27 should be as large as possible . for @xmath28 , the theoretical limit @xmath29 for the minimum time required to create a propagator @xmath20 is given by @xcite @xmath30 which corresponds to a maximum possible scaling factor",
    "@xmath31 it is sufficient to consider @xmath29 and @xmath32 only for @xmath28 , because @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is an arbitrary integer @xcite .",

    "in addition , @xmath53-selective and @xmath54-selective 180@xmath55 pulses are required in sequence a for selective decoupling of @xmath56 and @xmath57 during parts of the pulse sequence .",
    "in contrast , sequences b - d do not require such @xmath53-selective or @xmath54-selective pulses , which simplifies the experimental implementation of these pulse sequences if spins @xmath53 and @xmath54 are homonuclear .",
    "these sequences are also suitable for applications , where spins @xmath53 and @xmath54 are equivalent , as in i@xmath58s spin systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the fact that decoupling is avoided in sequences b - d makes these experiments considerably more efficient than sequence a ( _ vide infra _ ) .",
    "sequence b is a straight - forward generalization of a well - known pulse sequence developped initially @xcite for the special case of @xmath59 .",

    "the scaling factor @xmath64 of the geodesic sequence is 73.2% larger compared to sequence a and about 15.5% larger compared to sequences b and c. as @xmath19 approaches 0 , the scaling factor @xmath64 of the geodesic pulse sequence becomes infinitely larger than the scaling factors of sequences a - c .",
    "for example , for @xmath65 the scaling factor @xmath64 of the geodesic sequence is already about a factor of 10 larger compared to sequences a and b and about a factor of 5 larger compared to sequence c.    the basic pulse sequences shown in fig .",

    "however , for most practical applications , a finite offset range must be covered by the pulse sequences .",
    "broadband versions of sequence b can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "broadband versions of sequences a @xcite and c can be created in a straight - forward way by inserting additional @xmath68 pulses in the existing delays to refocus chemical shift evolution .",
    "for example , a broadband version of sequence c is shown in fig .",
    "the robustness of the broadband sequence with respect to rf inhomogeneity and offsets can be further improved by using the @xmath15 , @xmath69 , @xmath69 , @xmath15 cycle @xcite for the phases of the four @xmath68 pulses which are applied to spins @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    although no delays exist in the ideal geodesic pulse sequence shown in fig .",

    "4 ) , a broadband version of the geodesic pulse sequence can be created . as shown in fig .",

    "1em    in addition to applications in polarization transfer experiments @xcite , propagators corresponding to trilinear effective coupling terms are useful in the field of quantum information processing .",
    "for example , so - called @xmath78 gates @xcite can be implemented efficiently based on @xmath79 for @xmath59 . here , we focus on the implementation of swap operations @xcite that make it possible to exchange arbitrary spin states of two spins in a coupling network . for weakly coupled spins such as in the spin system defined in eq .
