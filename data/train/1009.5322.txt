    "there is widening interest in understanding how fluid streams and drops interact with micropatterned surfaces .",
    "for example chemical patterning can be used to direct streams of fluid , and hydrophobic surfaces which are rough on the micron or nanometre length scale can exhibit superhydrophobicity , characterised by contact angles near @xmath0 and easy roll - off  @xcite . a primary motivation to study micropatterned substrates comes from their potential applications as , for example , more efficient water and dew repellent materials , dehumidifiers or low drag surfaces . inspiration for these developments has come in part from nature where plants , such as the lotus  @xcite and nasturtium , have superhydrophobic leaves , and water - walking insects , like the water strider  @xcite , have superhydrophobic legs to allow them to interact with the the water in their environment .",
    "+ many of the natural surfaces that show strong water repellency are covered with tiny hairs .",
    "these can be long and flexible as on the leaves of lady s mantle or form a dense , spiky array as on the legs of the water strider .",
    "there have also been recent advances in the microfabrication of hairy surfaces  @xcite . to fully exploit these possibilities",
    "it is important to gain a better theoretical understanding of how fluids interact with hairy surfaces , and here we aim to make progress in this direction . in particular , we ask how the elasticity , wetting angle and incline of an array of hairs determine their effectiveness in supporting a liquid away from the base substrate . + a water drop deposited on a partially wetting solid does not spread indefinitely , but remains as a localised spherical cap , making a finite angle with the substrate .",
    "this angle is determined by the balance of surface tensions between water , air and solid surface , as given by young s law  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the surface tensions of water - air , substrate - air and substrate - water contact .",
    "@xmath5 , the young angle , describes a hydrophilic , hydrophobic or neutrally - wetting surface depending on whether it is below , above or equal to @xmath6 respectively . using known materials ,",
    "the young angle that can be achieved for water on a smooth substrate is no more than @xmath7 .",
    "however some rough surfaces can produce much higher contact angles .",
    "this occurs when the drop lies on top of the topographical structure , in the suspended or cassie - baxter state  @xcite . in the suspended state , the extra air - liquid interface at the base of the drop can result in a very high contact angle , even when the material is only slightly hydrophobic .",
    "moreover contact angle hysteresis is small and the drop rolls over the surface very easily  @xcite , so the suspended state is superhydrophobic .",
    "+ the drop can also penetrate the interstices between the relief , to lie in contact with all points of the substrate , in the collapsed or wenzel state  @xcite .",
    "the collapsed state boosts the contact angle only modestly , and increases resistance to a drop s motion  @xcite , so is usually not considered superhydrophobic . ensuring the feasiblilty and robustness of the suspended state is therefore an important consideration in the design of superhydrophobic surfaces .",
    "+ facilitating a suspended state for _ hydrophilic _ young angles would also have important applications .",
    "a major weakness of many superhydrophobic surfaces is that they fail to repel liquids other than water , for example hydrocarbons .",
    "this is because there are virtually no materials for which @xmath5 with respect to these liquids is greater than @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "oily substances will sit in the collapsed state or , worse , be imbibed into the structure .",
    "this will despoil the surface , because a water drop will now be in contact with the oil , rather than an air layer .",
    "if the surface can be made superoleophobic  @xcite , sustaining a suspended state for young angles below @xmath6 , then this problem will be solved .",
    "+ posts on a substrate with a degree of overhang may permit suspension , even when the young angle is hydrophilic , by pinning the contact line  @xcite .",
    "such surfaces have been constructed using mushroom shaped posts  @xcite . as an alternative to overhanging geometries",
    ", we investigate the possibility that flexible posts or hairs on a surface may deform to support water away from the surface , even when they are hydrophilic .",
    "+ the leaves of the lady s mantle ( _ alchemilla mollis / vulgaris _ ) are superhydrophobic  @xcite , with water forming beads on them",
    ". closer inspection shows them to be covered with fine hairs , just visible to the naked eye .",
    "surprisingly , experiments  @xcite found these hairs to be hydrophilic . otten and herminghaus",
    "@xcite stressed the importance of the flexibility of the hairs in sustaining the suspended state .",
    "they proposed that the hairs bunch together to reduce distortion of the interface , and the consequent energy cost of bending the hairs prevents them from being entirely wetted .",
    "these arguments were disputed by berndino et al  @xcite , who cast doubt on both the viability of the mechanism , and the elasticity of the lady s mantle hairs . + some arthropods , such as the water spider and the water boatman , can dive underwater for substantial periods .",
    "observations show a shiny appearance to the underside of these animals  @xcite , which is due to a layer of air trapped against the body , called a plastron .",
    "the plastron provides the means of respiration  @xcite , not by acting as an artificial lung ( a store of air taken from above water ) but as an artificial gill ( an interface through which gas exchange with the water may take place )  @xcite .",
    "thorpe and crisp  @xcite demonstrated that the air layer is trapped by a bed of hairs , such that the surrounding water is maintained in a suspended , superhydrophobic state .",
    "in contrast to the lady s mantle , it has been argued that flexibility undermines the water repellency of the plastron of a diving arthropod , with any bunching of hairs leaving gaps through which the water will invade  @xcite .",
    "conversely , it has been argued that flexibility of the hairs on an insect s legs can provide directional control as it walks on the pond surface  @xcite .",
    "these examples suggest that hair flexibility modifies the wetting properties of a surface in a rich and nontrivial way .",
    "+ a mathematical model of the static configurations of a drop on a hairy surface can be constructed by treating the drop as a capillary surface and the hairs as elastica . in recent years",
    ", there have been a number of such elastocapillary analyses  @xcite .",
    "of particular relevance to the work we present in this paper are those investigating the interaction of initally flat elastic sheets with an initially flat fluid interface .",
    "neukirch et al  @xcite , found that a perfectly wetting elastic beam , raised and lowered from a tank of liquid , exhibited hysteretic behaviour , arising from the metastable binding of the beam to the interface .",
    "park and kim  @xcite similarly showed that the threshold load for a clamped rod to pierce an interface was greater for a flexible rod than for a rigid rod .",
    "kim and mahadevan  @xcite studied the problem of capillary rise between a pair of elastic sheets arguing that , at modest flexibility , the height of capillary rise is increased by the narrowing of the gap , but for higher flexibilities the sheets can seal together , thus preventing further rise .",
    "these three studies  @xcite take the capillary length to be comparable to the system size so that gravity is an important influence which sets a decay length for disturbances of the fluid interface .",
    "the study we present in this paper differs from these by considering a periodic system with a capillary length much longer than the periodicity .",
    "gravity may therefore be ignored , leaving just a balance between the interfacial and bending energies .",
    "+ the model we treat is an interface supported by a line of flexible hairs .",
    "in general , the hairs will lie along the interface , thus alleviating the surface tension of the drop .",
    "we obtain an exact analytic solution in two dimensions which allows us to describe the possible drop configurations and obtain quantitative boundaries for the transitions between them . for vertical hairs , as for rigid posts , a drop placed in the suspended state can remain there only if the hairs are hydrophobic .",
    "however , for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic hairs , we identify a partially suspended state where the interface lies between the tops of the hairs and the surface .",
    "we show that , once the drop is in the partially suspended configuration it can remain there even for hydrophilic hairs .",
    "we discuss whether it is feasible for a drop placed gently on the surface to access the partially suspended state , and show that this is rather natural , if the hairs have a small angle of inclination to the vertical .",

    "<S> we investigate the wetting properties of surfaces patterned with fine elastic hairs , with an emphasis on identifying superhydrophobic states on hydrophilic hairs . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate a two dimensional model of a large drop in contact with a row of equispaced elastic hairs and , by minimising the free energy of the model , identify the stable and metastable states . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we concentrate on ` partially suspended ' states , where the hairs bend to support the drop  singlet states where all hairs bend in the same direction , and doublet states where neighbouring hairs bend in opposite directions  and find the limits of stability of these configurations in terms of material contact angle , hair flexibility , and system geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the drop can remain suspended in a singlet state at hydrophilic contact angles , but doublets exist only when the hairs are hydrophobic . </S>",
    "<S> the system is more likely to evolve into a singlet state if the hairs are inclined at the root . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how , under limited circumstances , the results can be modified to describe an array of hairs in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that now both singlets and doublets can exhibit superhydrophobic behaviour on hydrophilic hairs . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the limitations of our approach and the directions for future work . </S>"
