    "trapping mechanisms of particles are ubiquitous in physical applications and usually entail the presence of external potentials which rise in all possible directions .",
    "there are , however , a few examples in which this is not the case . several years ago , schult , ravenhall and wyld @xcite found numerical evidence for the existence of bound states in cross - wires , despite of the fact that the corresponding boundary - value problem is defined by an open geometry .",
    "in such a situation , classical particles always have the chance to escape .",
    "these unusual bound states are a purely wave - like phenomenon and they are but an example of the many interesting trapping effects that wave dynamics provides ( e.g. bound states dissolved in the continuum @xcite , bound solutions in smoothly curved wave guides @xcite , etc ) . over the years , it has been recognized @xcite that bound states in open geometries are supported by an increase of available space , either due to a large area in a cavity connected to infinite leads or due to the presence of bulges in tubes @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism can be understood as the contribution of long wavelengths inside a large region corresponding to evanescent modes along the tubes connected to the system .",
    "there is a clear separation between the evanescent states of low energy ( typically forming a discrete spectrum ) and the solutions above the propagating threshold , defined by the largest wavelength that is able to escape to infinity through the guides ( the continuum of the system ) .",
    "see figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "this sort of intuition , of course , is not a recent development .",
    "some scattering models of nuclear physics depict a stable composite as a bound state in some interaction region , while the possible outcomes of a reaction ( decay ) correspond to the propagating modes in the leads @xcite . in this context , it is well - known that an appropriate way to deal with such problems is through the study of the analytic properties of the scattering matrix or the reaction matrix as a function of energy and that the bound state energies can be identified as a specific type of poles @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     one technical aspect that should be covered in such a realisation , is the possibility of a non - vanishing coupling between second neighbours at the crossing point of the chains .",
    "see figure [ fig:6 ] .",
    "the field in the central cylinder c is supposed to see only the resonances from cylinders a. this is indeed the case if the distance between them is not too small . however , the field in a cylinder a might couple to its counterpart in the adjacent arm . in order to block such an interaction",
    ", one may simply put a screen of a conducting material .",
    "for example , a small copper plate .",
    "we should stress that the absence of a blocking screen would modify the interaction only in the central region by allowing extra bonds .",
    "therefore , we would expect again the existence of bound states in such an uncrontrolled situation .",
    "nevertheless , the number of bound states and their energies can no longer be predicted with our model .",
    "we expect the signature of the states in question in the part of the spectrum lying outside of the bloch band corresponding to linear periodic chains .",
    "the width of the band is determined by twice the coupling @xmath0 between nearest neighbours , a typical value being @xmath1mhz as mentioned before .",
    "the transmission between antennas can be measured as indicated in @xcite , both as a function of the injected frequency and the distance between them .",
    "we expect that for a pair of antennas placed close to the cylinders in the central region of the array , there should be two peaks in the transmission well separated from the resonance of an individual , isolated cylinder . according to our theory",
    ", they should appear at frequencies @xmath2 . as the antennas are moved along the arms and their distance",
    "is increased , the coupling between them should vanish exponentially , irrespective of the relative position between antennas and resonators . this shall be the clear indication of a bound state .",
    "let us summarise our results .",
    "we have shown that unusual bound states appearing in star - shaped junctions may diminish in number under a discretisation and dimensional reduction of the system , quantum chains .",
    "only one bound state remains in the lower part of the spectrum , but another one appears due to the discreteness of the system .",
    "therefore , the magic numbers of the array depend strongly on the conditions given above .",
    "the remaining bound states depend crucially on the existence of a vertex .",
    "the exact solutions of the problem exhibit the binding mechanism : the exponential decay of the eigenfunctions is due to values of the energy outside of the bloch band ( and their effect on @xmath3 ) .",
    "we have proposed an experiment in order to visualise the effect in simple terms .",
    "arrays of resonators can be incarnated in many forms , the dielectric cylinders supporting microwave resonances being only one example .    at this point",
    "we can discuss some consequences of our findings .",
    "let us focus first on the continuous case .",
    "in symmetrical star - shaped wires , the thickness of the leads acts as a natural scale parameter , such that a variation of the distance between the walls of the guides can be reinterpreted as a scale transformation of the variables @xmath4 .",
    "this only holds for a special type of geometries .",
    "the structure of the spectrum is therefore invariant under scaling , in the sense that the number of bound states remains intact .",
    "let @xmath5 . the helmholtz equation    ( x , y)=0 [ eq1 ] transforms trivially as    ( x,y)=0 , [ eq2 ] and the energy simply scales with @xmath6 , which is related to the thickness .",
    "interestingly , in some applications of one - dimensional quantum mechanics and quantum field theories such as quantum graphs @xcite , bound states in the absence of loops ( and in the absence of additional potentials ) are put by hand or disregarded at all . of course , this type of systems are _ born  _ as one - dimensional and with zero threshold , whereas in guides with a certain thickness we always have a fixed number of bound states during the limiting process @xmath7 .",
    "the dimensional reduction is thus a version of the effects described many years ago by da costa @xcite , where dimensionality combined with curvature gave rise to purely quantum potentials .",
    "now we turn to the discrete case .",
    "in contrast with the previous observations , our examples of quantum chains can be considered to be a one - dimensional idealization of a physical system _ ab initio  _ and where the bound states are unavoidable .",
    "the low dimensionality and the non - trivial topology are accompanied by discreteness , the latter being an important ingredient .",
    "this is a clear indication that a theory of quantum graphs in lattices should incorporate the results of the present paper .",
    "the author would like to express his gratitude to conacyt _ programa de repatriacin , convocatoria 2011 ,  _ for financial support .",
