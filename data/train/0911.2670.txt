    "due to the out - standing achievements in the neutrino oscillation experiments@xcite , we have convincing evidences on neutrino mass and lepton mixing . in the weak basis",
    "that the charged - lepton mass matrix is diagonal , real and positive , we assume massive neutrinos to be majorana particles and parametrize@xcite the lepton mixing @xmath7 as @xmath8 now the global fit@xcite of current experimental dada yields @xmath9 , @xmath10,@xmath11 at 1 @xmath6 .",
    "so the so - called tribimaximal mixing@xcite pattern is an excellent approximation for these physical values , which appears as the form of @xmath12 it corresponds to @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 in standard parametrization .",
    "this simple form with small integers motivates neutrino theorists to consider some underlying structures .",
    "the most intriguing one is flavor symmetry among generations , especially for discrete groups@xcite such as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , which can give predictable values or / and relations of mixing parameters . in general ,",
    "nearly tribimaximal mixing is also allowed , so small corrections to the standard form in ( [ tb ] ) are interesting and necessary",
    ". many sources can give these corrections such as charged lepton sector contributions@xcite and renormalization group effects@xcite .",
    "+ on the other way , seesaw mechanism@xcite can naturally explain the smallness of three left - handed neutrino masses .",
    "in the simplest type i framework , the effective majorana mass matrix of neutrinos @xmath19 is related to the dirac mass matrix @xmath20 and the heavy right - handed majorana mass matrix @xmath21 by the relation @xmath22 to explore the structure of the seesaw formula , the effective mixing can generally be derived from both @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "one of them can be chosen to be diagonal or even identity matrix for simplifications .",
    "one kind of models in ref.@xcite takes a diagonal @xmath20 for instance .",
    "meanwhile , another kind of seesaw models@xcite starts from a unit form of @xmath21 .",
    "+ now for the small corrections of tribimaximal mixing , another source@xcite in realistic seesaw models attracts our attentions .",
    "the leading order mixing matrix is totally derived from the dirac mass matrix @xmath20 , and @xmath21 has the simplest form of @xmath23 in the symmetry limit ( @xmath24 being a common mass scale and @xmath25 the identity matrix ) .",
    "the departure of @xmath21 from the unit matrix gives small corrections to the effective mixing matrix .",
    "there are two methods in @xmath21 to break the unit form , one is the nondegenerate masses , another is the un - degenerate phases : the phase breaking . in this letter , we want to discuss the second case , we consider small phase splitting for complex matrix @xmath21 , and maintain the degeneracy of the right - handed neutrino masses .",
    "we find that besides small corrections of the three mixing angles , we get nontrivial cp violation phases . + the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we talk about the realistic models from phase breaking , giving the predicted values of mixing parameters . in section iii , we do some numerical analysis , displaying the correlations of these parameters .",
    "we conclude our topic and give some remarks in section iv . in the appendix",
    ", we give our calculations from perturbation approximations .",
    "in our model , we adopt the basis started in@xcite .",
    "we think @xmath20 can be diagonalized by tribimaximal mixing matrix in the manner of @xmath26 which is constrained by a discrete flavor symmetry(such as @xmath17 symmetry ) .",
    "@xmath27 are positive mass parameters . for @xmath21 , we take the form of @xmath23 in the symmetry limit , obviously it is invariant under the symmetry .",
    "then we have @xmath28 in the following , we want to give small phase splitting to @xmath21 , and derive the light neutrino mass spectra and small corrections for lepton mixing parameters compared with the leading values of @xmath29 including cp violating phases .",
    "in this scenario , we give @xmath30 a small phase compared to the others , then @xmath21 take the form of @xmath31 similar to ( [ seesaw1 ] ) , the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath19 turns out to be @xmath32 with @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the corrections to @xmath36 come from the diagonalization of matrix @xmath37 . assuming @xmath38 , where @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the majorana neutrino masses .",
    "when we parameterize @xmath41 as @xmath42 we can derive these mixing parameters and masses by the relation of @xmath43 in terms of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in our calculation",
    ", we view @xmath44 ( or equivalently @xmath49 ) as a small parameter , and give results with the leading terms of the power series of @xmath49 , such as @xmath50 . by the perturbation calculations",
    ", we derive the relation of @xmath51 , immediately we have @xmath52 .",
    "other parameters are listed below @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the second expressions of @xmath56 and @xmath57 , we omit the contributions of higher powers of @xmath45 . combining @xmath41 together with @xmath36 and making a rephasing transformation , we can get the standard expression of neutrino mixing matrix @xmath7 as eq.([sp ] ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 can be rotated away by redefining the phases of three charged - lepton fields .",
    "then the standard parameters appear as @xmath60 and two standard majorana phases are @xmath61 in this scenario , we get a small deviation from tribimaximal mixing for @xmath2 , and two majorana phases , but @xmath62 and @xmath63 remain unchanged . because of the vanishing value of @xmath62",
    ", we can not obtain the information of dirac cp phase .",
    "contrarily if we give @xmath64 another small phase compared to @xmath65 , we can obtain a non - vanishing @xmath62 and then a non - trivial dirac cp violation phase .",
    "as discussed in the end of last section , we take a general form of @xmath21 as @xmath66 then we will repeat the same procedure as before .",
    "firstly the effective neutrino mass matrix are @xmath67 then we define @xmath68 , with @xmath69 is an unitary matrix parameterized as @xmath70 where @xmath71(for @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 and similar definitions for @xmath74 and @xmath75 . by using @xmath76 , we arrive at the approximate expressions for @xmath77 and @xmath78 via perturbation calculations.(we will give a careful calculations of perturbation approximations in the appendix . )",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 and the masses are @xmath81 finally we give the phase - angles @xmath82 in eq.([par2 ] ) @xmath83 a normal hierarchy mass spectrum(small values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) is favored in this scenario due to the stability of perturbation calculation(see the appendix ) .",
    "so for the analytical expressions in ( [ sinsin ] ) ( [ sincos ] ) and ( [ mi ] ) , we express them with the leading terms of the power series of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "more detailed expressions and discussions can be found in the appendix .",
    "+ now we want to exhibit the mixing matrix @xmath84 with the standard parametrization as in eq.([sp ] ) . by a rephasing transformation",
    ", we get @xmath85 by a lengthy but straightforward calculation , we can get the standard predictions .",
    "the dirac type cp phase is predicted as @xmath86 and the majorana cp phases are @xmath87 about the mixing angles , we can obtain a small departure from the tribimaximal mixing in the manner of @xmath88 immediately , when @xmath89 , the predicted values return to the corresponding ones in _ scenario a _ as we expect to , and the dirac phase @xmath4 is undetermined due to zero of @xmath90 .",
    "the small parameter @xmath1 is responsible for the non - vanishing @xmath62 and non - maximality of @xmath63 , and the mixing angle @xmath2 depends on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in this scenario , we predict a nearly maximal dirac phase , so the rephasing invariant jarlskog parameter @xmath91@xcite is determined only by the three mixing angles in leading order @xmath92 indeed , the most general dirac mass matrix @xmath20 can be diagonalized by two distinct unitary matrices @xmath93 and @xmath94 ,",
    "so if we identify @xmath93 as the exact tribimaximal form , the high order corrections come from the contribution of @xmath95 , which is a unitary symmetric matrix if the mass parameters in @xmath21 are degenerated .",
    "this case has been discussed for the ( light ) effective majorona mass matrix with exact degenerate masses@xcite .",
    "they found there are only two mixing angles and one cp phase in the parametrization of mixing matrix , but it does not include the case with the same cp parity as a limit . in our scenarios , we want to get higher order corrections from the diagonalization of @xmath96 , so we are only interested in the nearly unit form of @xmath96 .",
    "it is convenient to parameterized as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a real unitary ( orthogonal ) matrix and @xmath99 is a diagonal unitary matrix with small @xmath100 denoting the small departure from unit form of @xmath101 . in the beginning of our calculation , we have identified @xmath98 with the explicit form of @xmath102 for simplicity .",
    "although this is only a special example , but it is enough to reveal the property of our scenarios and correlations of these corrections . in next section , we will show them numerically .",
    "_ scenario b _ returns to _ scenario a _ when @xmath89 , so we can only concern the general case . to do numerical analysis",
    ", we will include higher order contributions of @xmath45 and @xmath46as in ( ( 5.2 ) , ( 5.7)(5.9 ) ) .",
    "firstly , the correlations of @xmath45 and @xmath46 come form the ratio of @xmath103 and @xmath104 by the relation of @xmath105 using the numerical results in @xcite which reveal that @xmath106 and @xmath107 at 1 @xmath6 , we can obtain the allowed region of @xmath45 versus @xmath46 in fig.1 .",
    "the mass spectrum changes from hierarchy region to nearly degenerate region as @xmath45 grows .",
    "and @xmath46 takes a nearly fixed value in the hierarchy region . as discussed in the appendix ,",
    "only the normal hierarchy mass spectrum is valid in our scenarios , so we restrict the parameter @xmath108 in our analysis . + the departure of mixing matrix from the standard tribimaximal mixing depends on the two small parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "if we change the values of @xmath109 , we can get the correlation relations between mixing parameters(mixing angles and cp phases ) defined in ( [ sp ] ) .",
    "scanning @xmath109 within a reasonable range([0.5,0.5 ] ) , we give five pictures fig.2fig.6 as typical examples .",
    "the angles and phases are measured in degrees .",
    "some comments are listed below .",
    "+ @xmath110 for the relation of between @xmath2 and @xmath62 in fig.2 , we can see that the correction of @xmath2 is only at the left side , which has been revealed in ( [ corb ] ) for leading corrections , indicating that a relatively small @xmath2 is favored , which is in accordance with the best fit point ( @xmath111 ) of global analysis@xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath62 is too small ( @xmath112 ) to be measured in the near future .",
    "the sensitivity of the proposed reactor neutrino experiments to @xmath62 is at the level of @xmath113(@xmath114)@xcite .",
    "moreover , a larger deviation of @xmath2 from @xmath3 ( @xmath115 ) implies a more stringent constraint on @xmath62 , including a lower bound .",
    "+ @xmath110 in fig.3 , the deviation of @xmath63 can extend to both side , but with an unsymmetrical shape .",
    "the magnitude of this deviation is less than @xmath116 .",
    "a larger @xmath62 allows a smaller region of @xmath63 .",
    "oppositely , a larger deviation of @xmath63 from maximality implies a smaller range for @xmath62 .",
    "+ @xmath110 the dirac type cp phase @xmath4 favors a nearly maximal value which can be understood in ( [ delta ] ) and in fig.4 .",
    "the relatively broad width results from the large range of @xmath117 .",
    "the figure shows that the more deviation of @xmath4 from maximality , the more stringent upper bound @xmath62 suffers .",
    "the jarlskog parameter @xmath91 can reach the order of @xmath118 at most , which is limited by the relatively small value of @xmath62 .",
    "+ @xmath110 just as revealed in fig.5 , the two majorana cp phases @xmath5 and @xmath6 have distributions among [ @xmath119,@xmath120 peaked at zero , which is consistent with leading predictions of ( [ rhosigma ] ) .",
    "also , fig.6 shows that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are strongly correlated with each other , having a nearly linear dependence .",
    "the slope of @xmath5 versus @xmath6 defined in ( [ rhosigma ] ) approximates to @xmath121 , and the corresponding one in fig.6 lies between @xmath122 , where the higher order contributions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 have been included .",
    "to conclude , we discuss possible corrections to the tribimaximal pattern of lepton mixing in a simple seesaw model , which is the results of phase breaking of right - handed neutrino matrix .",
    "we consider small phase splitting for complex matrix @xmath21 , but maintain the degeneracy of the right - handed neutrino masses .",
    "the breaking of the unit form of @xmath21 in the seesaw model gives small corrections to the zero order form of the mixing matrix .",
    "as revealed in ( [ corb ] ) , the corrections of @xmath62 , @xmath2 , and @xmath63 are of order @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath124 respectively .",
    "@xmath2 favors a smaller value compared to the zero order value of @xmath3 .",
    "the dirac type cp phase @xmath4 is likely to have a nearly maximal value .",
    "for the two majorana cp phases @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath6 , they have a nearly linear correlation . +",
    "a normal hierarchy mass spectrum is favored in our scenarios , leading to insignificant renormalization group effects@xcite of the mixing matrix .",
    "the exact mass degeneracy of the righthanded neutrinos forbids cp violation in the lepton - number - violating decays@xcite , so there is no thermal leptogenesis@xcite .",
    "generally , we should include both effects mentioned in the introduction : the nondegenerate masses and the nondegenerate phases .",
    "but our discussions are valid when the mass degeneracy breaking is much smaller than the latter one . the general cases including both ( and the corresponding leptogenesis ) are certainly interesting and need further discussions",
    "+ there are other interesting aspects on the corrections to tribimaximal mixing based on either different assumptions@xcite or general parameterizations@xcite .",
    "they can only be distinguished by precision measurements in future reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments@xcite .",
    "when we want to diagonalize the matrix of @xmath125 in ( [ mb ] ) , we refer to the assumption that parameters @xmath109 are small enough to do perturbation calculations . in the relation of @xmath76,we think equations are realized in each order for the power series of @xmath109",
    ". then when we put the approximation to the order of @xmath109 ( @xmath126 ) , we can get three equations by the relations of three off - diagonal elements @xmath127 then we get the results as @xmath128 and @xmath129 which indicate maximality for @xmath130(@xmath131 ) .",
    "we want to know the departure from maximality in order of @xmath126 , so terms in order of @xmath132 must be considered in equations of ( [ equation1 ] ) . up to this order",
    "those equations have the form of @xmath133 \\nonumber\\\\ -6\\sin\\theta_{1}\\sin\\phi_{1}\\sin\\theta_{2}\\sin\\phi_{2 } - \\sqrt{6}\\sin\\theta_{2}\\sin\\phi_{2}\\delta_{2}\\eta + \\sqrt{3}\\sin\\theta_{1}\\sin\\phi_{1}\\delta_{2}\\omega\\eta = 0 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath134 - 6\\eta^{2}\\sin\\theta_{1}\\sin\\phi_{1}\\sin\\theta_{3}\\sin\\phi_{3 } \\nonumber\\\\ -\\sqrt{2}\\sin\\theta_{1}\\sin\\phi_{1}(2\\delta_{1}-\\delta_{2})\\omega\\eta^{2 } - \\sqrt{6}\\sin\\theta_{3}\\sin\\phi_{3}\\delta_{2}\\eta = 0 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath135 -6\\omega^{2}\\eta^{2}\\sin\\theta_{2}\\sin\\phi_{2}\\sin\\theta_{3}\\sin\\phi_{3 } \\nonumber\\\\ -\\sqrt{2}\\sin\\theta_{2}\\sin\\phi_{2}(2\\delta_{1}-\\delta_{2})\\omega\\eta^{2 } + \\sqrt{3}\\sin\\theta_{3}\\sin\\phi_{3}\\delta_{2}\\omega\\eta= 0 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] firstly , the imaginary parts of the equations are in order of @xmath126 , giving the same values of @xmath136 as in ( [ sinsin2 ] ) .",
    "contrarily , from the real parts of the order of @xmath137 , we can obtain the expressions for @xmath138 .",
    "these results read as @xmath139 following the spirits of perturbation calculation , higher order contributions only give small corrections , meaning that the results are stable .",
    "comparing these results with those of ( [ sincos2 ] ) , we can see that if the parameter @xmath45 or @xmath46(or both ) is very close to 1 ( quasi - degenerate or inverted hierarchy mass spectrum ) , the property of perturbation will be ruined .",
    "so a normal hierarchy(small @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) neutrino mass spectrum is favored in this scenario . then for analytical expressions , we can simplify them with the leading terms for power series of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "for the results of @xmath136 and @xmath138 , we have @xmath140 and @xmath141 similarly , for the diagonal elements in @xmath76 , we can get the information of @xmath142 and @xmath143 as @xmath144 and @xmath83 for small mass ratios , the three masses are expressed as @xmath145      q.r .  ahmad _ et al . _",
