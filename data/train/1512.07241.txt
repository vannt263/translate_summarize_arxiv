    "in two dimensional conformal field theories the construction of conformal interfaces between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is equivalent to the construction of conformal boundary conditions in the folded cft which is the tensor product @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "there is a special class of interfaces which are called topological interfaces . in the folded cft the condition for an interface to be topological is @xcite @xmath3 this condition implies that the interface is completely transmissive and these interfaces are called topological since their position and shape can be deformed without cost of energy .",
    "in addition one can define a fusion product of topological interfaces by bringing two of them close together @xcite .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that topological interfaces can furnish spectrum generating symmetries .",
    "topological interfaces have been constructed for a single free boson in @xcite and for @xmath4 free bosons compactified on an @xmath4 dimensional torus in @xcite .",
    "topological interfaces in orbifold theories have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy of a spatial region @xmath5 is defined by the von neumann entropy of a reduced density matrix which is obtained by integrating out the degrees of freedom localized in the complement of @xmath5 . for two dimensional cfts @xcite the entanglement entropy , where @xmath5 is a single interval of length @xmath6 ,",
    "is given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 is an uv cutoff and we dropped terms which vanish as @xmath9 .",
    "the logarithmically divergent term only depends on the central charge of the cft .",
    "generically the constant term is non - universal and dependent on the definition of the cutoff since a simple rescaling of the cutoff is equivalent to adding a constant term to the entanglement entropy .    in the presence of a boundary or an interface",
    "the constant term becomes physical as one can study the difference in entanglement entropy for a system with an interface and without , and the dependence on the uv cutoff cancels in this case . in the case of a conformal interface",
    "there are two different geometric setups which one can consider .",
    "first if the interface is located at the center of the entangling region @xmath5 then @xcite the entanglement entropy is of the form given in and the constant term is the so called @xmath10-factor or boundary entropy @xcite .",
    "a second geometry is given by choosing the interface to be located at the boundary of the entangling region @xmath5 .",
    "the entanglement entropy in this case has only been calculated for some specific cases , notably for generic conformal interfaces for a single free boson in @xcite and the ising model in @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy in this case takes the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a complicated function depending on the parameters of the conformal interface , which we schematically denote by @xmath13 .",
    "the entanglement entropies for janus like interface theories @xcite have been calculated for the symmetric geometry in @xcite and for the case where the interface is at the boundary of the entangling surface in @xcite .",
    "the goal of this note is to calculate the entanglement entropies for both geometric setups for topological interfaces in rational cfts .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we review the construction of topological interfaces in rational cfts which goes back to the work of petkova and zuber @xcite . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we adapt the calculation of sakai and satoh @xcite to calculate the entanglement entropy for the case where the topological interface is at the boundary of the entangling surface . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we adapt the calculation of sakai and satoh to re - derive the entanglement entropy for the symmetric interface and also give an argument that the location of the interface does not change the result as long as it is a finite distance away from the boundaries of the entangling interval . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we compare the entanglement entropies for various specific cases .",
    "we also include the recently computed left / right entropy @xcite for reference . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we compare results of entanglement entropies for compact bosons which were previously obtained in the literature . in section [ sec7 ]",
    "we use the construction of topological interfaces in liouville theory given in @xcite to attempt a calculation of the entanglement entropy for this system .",
    "we close with a discussion of future directions of research in section [ sec8 ] .",
    "* note added * : while this paper was finalized a paper @xcite appeared , which has significant overlap with the material presented in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "in this section we consider the construction of topological interfaces in rational cfts . a rational cft ( rcft )",
    "@xcite contains a finite number of primary states and hence a finite number of representations of the virasoro algebra , labeled by @xmath14 , with characters @xmath15 .",
    "the partition function on the torus is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 are positive integers which denote how many times a representation appears in the spectrum of the theory .",
    "we mostly limit ourselves the the case where @xmath18 and the theory has a diagonal spectrum .",
    "the canonical examples for rational cfts are the unitary minimal models which have central charge @xmath19 and the primaries are labeled by two integers @xmath20 and @xmath21 and have conformal dimension @xmath22 the simplest minimal model is the ising model which has @xmath23 and hence we have @xmath24 and three primaries with @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    in @xcite twisted partition functions for rational cfts were studied .",
    "they are characterized by the insertion of an operator @xmath28 into the partition function , where @xmath28 satisfies @xmath29=[\\bar l_n , i]=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in @xcite a classification of such operators was given analogous to the construction of cardy states @xcite .",
    "for the diagonal theories one finds @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a projector on the space spanned by the @xmath32 primary and its descendants @xmath33 this means that in the simple diagonal case there are as many topological interfaces as there are primaries , where for simplicity we assume that each primary only appears once in the theory ; a degeneracy can be easily included in the construction .",
    "the matrix @xmath34 is the modular @xmath34 matrix which denotes how the characters transform under modular transformation @xmath35 @xmath36 the conjugate interface operator is given by @xmath37 in summary it is notable that the classification of @xcite of twisted partition function also provides us with a classification of topological interfaces in rcfts .",
    "the entanglement entropy for an interval @xmath5 is given by the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the complement of @xmath5 .",
    "the replica trick relates the entanglement entropy to the renyi entropies as follows @xmath40     maps the k - sheeted riemann surface to the geometry on the right .",
    "the circles on the left part of the figure correspond to an uv cutoff located @xmath41 and an ir cutoff located at @xmath42 .",
    "this figure was adapted from @xcite.,width=434 ]    the renyi entropies are calculated by a path integral over a k - sheeted riemann surface with branch cuts running along @xmath5 . the entanglement entropy can then be derived from the partition function @xmath43 on the k - sheeted riemann surface by @xmath44 in @xcite it has been argued that the interface can be included in the k - sheeted partition function @xmath43 . the interface gets mapped via @xmath45 to a covering space ( see figure [ fig : replica ] ) . introducing an uv cutoff @xmath8 and an ir cutoff @xmath6 and imposing periodic boundary conditions for simplicity",
    ", the k - th replica partition function can be expressed as a trace @xmath46 where the  time \" is related to the cutoffs by @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the hamiltonian of the cft .",
    "the @xmath49-th partition function with a topological interface labeled by a primary @xmath50 inserted is @xmath51^k\\big)\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\operatorname{tr}\\big ( [ i_a i_a^\\dagger ] ^k   q^{2k ( l_0-{c\\over 24 } ) } \\bar q^{2k(\\bar l_0-{c\\over 24})}\\big)\\nonumber\\\\   & = \\sum_i \\left| { s_{ai}\\over s_{0i } } \\right|^{2k }   \\chi_i(q^{2k})\\chi_{\\bar i}(\\bar q^{2k})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced @xmath52 . in the second line we have used to commute @xmath53 through the hamiltonian and in the third line we used the fact that the @xmath54 in are projectors to the @xmath14-th representation and the trace produces the associated character @xmath55 .",
    "since we are interested in taking the uv cutoff @xmath9 ( and taking @xmath56 ) , we have to evaluate in the limit @xmath57 . with the identification of a new modular parameter @xmath58 by @xmath59 with",
    "@xmath60 given in , the limit can taken by performing a modular transformation on the characters @xmath61\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath62 the leading contribution in will come from the vacuum characters which have @xmath63 . in that case",
    "the partition function becomes @xmath64 where the dots indicate terms which vanish as the cutoff is taken to zero . further calculating @xmath65 where we have repeatedly used the fact that @xmath34 is symmetric , unitary , and in particular the relation @xmath66 .",
    "putting everything together we arrive at the following expression for the entanglement entropy at a topological interface @xmath67",
    "for an interface which is located symmetrically on the entangling interval @xmath5 the entanglement entropy has been calculated by @xcite and is given by    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the boundary g - factor which when the interface is folded into a boundary state is determined by the overlap of the boundary state corresponding to the doubled interface with the vacuum state @xcite @xmath70 for the topological interface the boundary state becomes @xmath71 consequently the @xmath10 factor is given by @xmath72 and the symmetric entanglement entropy becomes @xmath73    up to now we have considered the symmetric case where the interface is located at the center of the entangling interval @xmath5 .",
    "there is however a simple argument showing that for topological interfaces the location of the interface does not change the result as long as it is a finite distance away from the boundary of the entangling interval .",
    "we illustrate the argument in figure [ fig : figure2 ] .",
    "we start in the @xmath74 plane with a finite interval @xmath5 with boundary at @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where the interface is located along @xmath77 .",
    "we map the @xmath74 plane into the @xmath78 plane by the map @xmath79        this maps the finite interval to the positive real axis and the interface @xmath28 gets mapped to an off centre circle .",
    "finally we perform the replica map to the @xmath80 coordinate via @xmath45 and impose periodic boundary conditions as before at the cutoff @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this produces again a torus . unlike the case of the interface at the boundary here",
    "the interface is mapped into a vertical curve on the torus . for a topological interface",
    "it is clear that the shape can be changed and changing the location along the real part of @xmath80 corresponds to changing the original location @xmath83 of the interface .",
    "this shows that partition function on the @xmath49-th sheeted riemann surface is independent of @xmath83 as long as the interface is a finite distance away form the cutoffs",
    ". we can be more specific and evaluate the partition function @xmath84 where @xmath85 where @xmath60 is again given by , hence in the limit of vanishing cutoff the sum over representations in the partition function gets projected on the vacuum character and one has @xmath86 applying the replica formula one obtains @xmath87 comparing ( [ symresx ] ) with ( [ ssymfinal ] ) one notices an extra factor of @xmath88 in ( [ symresx ] ) in the @xmath89 term .",
    "this seeming discrepancy comes from the fact that the replica calculation leading to ( [ symresx ] ) calculates the entanglement entropy for a semi - infinite entangling surface ( as we take @xmath6 to be very large ) with only one end point , whereas the result of cardy and calabrese ( [ ssymfinal ] ) is for an interval with two end points , which doubles the logarithmically divergent contribution according to the area law for entanglement entropy .",
    "the same remark applies when one compares ( [ sadef ] ) and ( [ safinal ] ) .",
    "additionally it is clear that for a topological interface moving the interface along the real axis in the @xmath80 coordinates does not change as the interface operator commutes with the generator of these translations , which is the hamiltonian .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : figure2 ] that the independence of the symmetric entanglement entropy from the location of the interface breaks down if the interface approaches the uv cutoff @xmath8 , as part of the interface would be removed by the cutoff .",
    "this explains why the entanglement entropies ( [ safinal ] ) and ( [ ssymfinal ] ) can be different .",
    "a third type of entanglement entropy which takes a similar form is the so called left / right entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "this is defined for a boundary cft , where the entanglement entropy is calculated with a reduced density matrix obtained by tracing over left - moving modes .",
    "interestingly for a boundary cft defined by a cardy state @xcite ( for a single copy of the cft , not the doubled one we are considering in the previous sections ) @xmath90 where @xmath91 are the ishibashi states @xcite enforcing conformal boundary conditions .",
    "we quote the result of the calculation of the left / right entanglement entropy which is also labeled by a primary @xmath50 in a rcft , obtained in @xcite    @xmath92    the physical interpretation of the left / right entanglement entropy ( as it is non - geometrical ) is not clear at this point as well as its relation to the other two entropies is not clear at the moment .",
    "the similarities of the resulting entropies might still suggest that such a relation exists .",
    "a better understanding of the relation of the cutoffs utilized may be necessary to accomplish this .",
    "for the @xmath93-th unitary minimal models the modular @xmath34 matrix is given by ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath94 using this formula it is in principle straightforward to evaluate the three entanglement entropies @xmath95 given in , @xmath96 given in and @xmath97 given in .",
    "here we give a table for the two simplest cases , namely the ising model with @xmath23 and the tri - critical ising model with @xmath98 .",
    "the ising model has 3 primaries which we can label by the conformal dimension @xmath99 and the @xmath34 matrix becomes @xmath100 the entanglement entropies then take the following values    .entanglement entropies for the ising model [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]",
    "a general class of conformal interfaces for a free boson was constructed in @xcite .",
    "the interfaces are characterized by two radii @xmath101 and two relatively prime integers @xmath102 .",
    "note that a compact boson is not a rcft and the results of the previous sections can not be directly applied . instead we will review results obtained in the literature to contrast the entanglement entropies for this case .",
    "these correspond to an interface between two compactified bosons where the compactification radius jumps from @xmath103 to @xmath104 across the interface . in the doubled bcft description",
    "the interface corresponds to a geometric d1 brane stretched on a rectangular torus with radii @xmath103 and @xmath104 where its one dimensional world volume wraps @xmath105 times around the @xmath103 circle and @xmath106 times around the @xmath104 circle . in general",
    "these interfaces are not topological but for special values of the radii where the following condition is satisfied @xmath107 the defects become topological .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the complicated behavior of the logarithmically divergent term of the entanglement entropy for the interface at the boundary of the entangling surface simplifies and the entanglement entropy becomes @xmath108 we can contrast this explicit expression to the one of symmetric entanglement entropy , the @xmath69 factor for a general interface is given by @xcite @xmath109 and hence the symmetric entanglement entropy for the topological interface which satisfies becomes @xmath110 where the constant part is half the value of the constant part of @xmath111 . note that if we consider the case of an interface between identical cfts , we have @xmath112 and by @xmath113 for topological interfaces .",
    "in @xcite topological interfaces for the liouville cft ( see @xcite for reviews with references to the original literature ) were constructed following the procedure which was used for rcfts .",
    "there are two types of defects which are both of the form @xmath114 where we integrate @xmath115 over the positive real line , i.e. @xmath116 , and one has @xmath117 , which determines the central charge as @xmath118 . here",
    "@xmath119 is a projector on the continuum of primary states labeled by @xmath115 and their descendants . @xmath120",
    "as shown in @xcite one can distinguish the two @xmath121 by associating them with the discrete degenerate primary states labeled by two positive integers @xmath122 and a non - degenerate primary state labeled by a continuous real parameter @xmath123 @xmath124 we can now calculate the @xmath49-sheeted partition function with the interface inserted . using the fact that the projectors satisfy @xmath125 and the fact that the interface operator @xmath28 satisfies we arrive at @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the character of the non - degenerate liouville primary field labeled by @xmath115 and is given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 and we can use the following formula for the modular transformation of the character @xmath130 with the identification and @xmath60 given by as before , the modular transformed @xmath49-sheeted partition function becomes @xmath131 in the limit @xmath132 we can replace the full character @xmath127 by its leading term @xmath133 and perform the gaussian integrals over @xmath134 and @xmath135 which produce the same result .",
    "hence we arrive at @xmath136 where the dots denote terms which vanish as @xmath60 goes to zero .",
    "we would now like to use this expression to calculate the entanglement entropy using the replica formula .",
    "note that for the case where @xmath121 is labeled by a continuous parameter @xmath123 and given by @xmath137 in the integral vanishes for large @xmath115 .",
    "it is therefore legitimate to drop the exponent @xmath138 in the integral and the non vanishing terms in entanglement entropy for this case are given by @xmath139 we notice two curious features of this result .",
    "first , the logarithmically divergent term is multiplied by @xmath140 which is what one would expect for a @xmath141 cft , whereas the central charge of the liouville theory is given by @xmath142 .",
    "a possible explanation for this behavior lies in the fact that for the interface labelled by ( [ contcase ] ) only the continuous primaries with conformal dimension @xmath143 appear .",
    "hence the vacuum with @xmath144 is excluded and the factor of @xmath145 in front of ( [ ssresult ] ) is most likely associated with a shifted effective central charge .",
    "second , apart from finite terms as @xmath132 we also obtain an additonal divergent term of the form @xmath146 from the second term . the significance and interpretation of this term is not clear at this point and a more careful treatment of the cutoff might be necessary . for the interfaces labeled by discrete integers @xmath147 defined in , @xmath148 diverges for large @xmath115 and the full integral has to be evaluated first in order to obtain the entanglement entropy .",
    "we leave this problem for future work .",
    "in this paper we have discussed entanglement entropies in the presence of topological defects in two geometric settings , namely when the interface is located at the boundary of the entangling interval @xmath5 and when it is in the center of the entangling interval . for topological defects in rcfts the logarithmic part of the entanglement entropy is always universal ( this is not the case for general conformal interfaces ) and the constant term can be expressed in a compact form in terms of the modular matrix @xmath34 .",
    "note that the entanglement entropies have a similar form in terms of the modular matrix s as the recently obtained left / right entanglement entropy for a related bcft , but the physical relation of the left / right entanglement entropy to the others is not clear at the moment .",
    "there are several directions in which our results can be generalized .",
    "we have limited ourselves to rcfts with diagonal partition functions .",
    "the construction of @xcite also includes non - diagonal theories and it would be interesting to understand the entanglement entropy for this case",
    ". we also only considered cfts which are rational with respect to the virasoso algebra , it would also be very interesting to repeat the analysis for rcfts with respect to extended chiral algebras .",
    "since the large @xmath93 limit of minimal models is conjectured to approach a non - rational @xmath141 cft which is different from a free boson @xcite it would be interesting to study the continuation of the minimal model entanglement entropy .    it would also be interesting to understand the entanglement entropy for liouville theory better .",
    "apart from the calculations sketched in section [ sec7 ] one might also consider semiclassical limits where @xmath149 and analyze the role of topological defects in classical liouville theory following @xcite .",
