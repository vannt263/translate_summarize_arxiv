    "recently , verlinde @xcite makes one interesting proposal that gravity may be explained as an entropic force caused by the changes in the information associated with the positions of material bodies .",
    "the proposal is very interesting in the following two aspects . in the first place , with the assumption of the entropic force together with the unruh temperature @xcite , verlinde is able to derive the second law of newtonian mechanics . secondly , the assumption of the entropic force together with the holographic principle @xcite and the equipartition law of energy can lead to the newtonian law of gravitation .",
    "similar discoveries are also made by padmanabhan @xcite .",
    "padmanabhan finds that using the equipartition law of energy for the horizon and the thermodynamic relation @xmath4 , one can obtain the newtonian law of gravity .",
    "here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are thermodynamic entropy and the temperature associated with the horizon .",
    "@xmath7 is the active gravitational mass which produces the gravitational field in the spacetime @xcite .",
    "actually , jacobson has derived the einstein s equations by employing the clausius relation and the equivalence principle in 1995 @xcite .    using the entropic force ,",
    "shu and gong @xcite , cai , cao and ohta @xcite derived the friedmann equation nearly simultaneously while with different methods . on the other hand , using this entropic force , smolin @xcite derived the newtonian gravity in loop quantum gravity .",
    "m@xmath8kel@xmath8 @xcite pointed out that verlinde s entropic force is actually the consequence of a specific microscopic model of spacetime @xcite .",
    "similar ideas were applied to the construction of holographic actions from black hole entropy by caravelli and modesto @xcite .",
    "li and wang @xcite showed that the holographic dark energy @xcite can be derived from the entropic force formula .",
    "we note that statistical thermodynamics reveals the equipartition law of energy does not hold in the very low temperatures .",
    "it is found the debye model is very successful in explaining the experimental results for most of the solid objects . in particular , many experiments on debye model indicate that the lower the temperature , the better the consistency is .    on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum theory of black holes finds black holes satisfy the first law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the unruh effect indicates that a gravitational field corresponds a thermal bath with temperature of @xmath6 .",
    "so every gravitational system may be physically corresponding to a statistical thermodynamics system .",
    "since the equipartition law of energy does not hold in low temperatures for thermodynamic system , we anticipate the entropic force formula should be modified for the very weak gravitational fields .    actually , the strength of gravitational fields are @xmath9 on the earth , @xmath2 for the solar system ( felt by the neptune ) and @xmath3 for the galaxy ( felt by the sun ) . in one word ,",
    "the strength of gravitational field becomes smaller and smaller with the increasing of scales .",
    "therefore , it may be plausible that the entropic force ( or newtonian gravity ) takes a different form in the background of an extreme weak gravitational field .    in this paper , motivated by the debye s model in thermodynamics , we extend the entropic force formula . with this modification , we find the resulting entropic force can speed up the expansion of the universe",
    ". we shall use the system of units with @xmath10 and the metric signature @xmath11 throughout the paper .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a compact spatial region @xmath12 with a compact boundary @xmath13 which is a sphere .",
    "the compact boundary @xmath13 plays the role of a holographic screen .",
    "the number @xmath14 of bits for freedom on the screen is taken to be equal to the area @xmath15 of the screen : @xmath16 let @xmath17 denotes the proper gravitational acceleration on the screen which is produced by the matter sources inside the screen @xmath13 .",
    "then the unruh effect tells us the gravitational field would correspond to a system filled with thermal gas with the temperature of @xmath6 for a proper observer : @xmath18 so according to the equipartition law of energy , the total energy inside the screen is @xmath19 verlinde assumes the energy is equal to the gravitational mass @xmath20 inside the screen : @xmath21 combining above equations , we can obtain the spherically symmetric and static gravitational field equations : @xmath22 namely , @xmath23 it is exactly the newtonian law of gravity .",
    "statistical thermodynamics tells us the equipartition law of energy fails in the very low temperatures .",
    "it is found the debye model is very successful for most of solid objects .",
    "since a gravitational system may be physically corresponding to a statistical thermodynamics system and the strength of gravitational field becomes smaller and smaller with the increasing of cosmic scales , we anticipate the newtonian gravity may be modified on the very large scale of the universe .    motivated by this point , we modify the equipartition law of energy as follows : @xmath24 where the debye function is defined by @xmath25 @xmath26 is related to the temperature @xmath6 as follows : @xmath27 @xmath28 is the debye critical temperature . for a gravitational system , @xmath28 is related to the critical gravitational acceleration .",
    "so we obtain the modified entropic force from eq .",
    "( [ eq : debeye ] ) as follows    @xmath29    with @xmath30 the debye acceleration is related to the debye temperature @xmath31 we note that when @xmath32 , i.e. in the limit of strong gravitational field , we have @xmath33 so the newtonian gravity is recovered . on the other hand , in the limit of weak gravitational field , i.e , @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 in this limit , the gravitational field is very different from newtonian gravity . in the next ,",
    "let s look for the value of @xmath0 from the considerations of cosmological physics . using the method of shu and gong @xcite",
    ", we obtain the following equation @xmath37\\;.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath38 are the total energy density and total pressure of cosmic fluids , respectively .",
    "@xmath39 are the scale factor and hubble parameter , respectively . @xmath40",
    "describe the three kind of geometry of the universe .",
    "dot denotes the derivative with respect to the comic time @xmath41 . taking into account the hawking temperature @xmath6 for the universe @xcite @xmath42 we find @xmath26 can be rewritten as @xmath43 thus the critical hubble parameter @xmath44 is exactly the debye acceleration @xmath0 : @xmath45 eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq ] ) together with the energy conservation equation @xmath46 govern the evolution of the universe . using these two equations ,",
    "we find the current cosmic acceleration can be interpreted while without invoking any kind of dark energy .",
    "to show this point , we may investigate the cosmic evolution sourced by dark matter and baryon matter .",
    "observations reveal that the universe is highly flat in space .",
    "so in the following we shall put @xmath47 .",
    "define @xmath48 combining eq .",
    "( 16 ) and eq .",
    "( 20 ) we obtain the friedmann equation : @xmath49dh^2\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let @xmath50 then we have @xmath51\\cdot\\frac{\\zeta^2}{x^3}dx\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath52 here @xmath53 are the hubble parameter , total energy density and matter energy density ratio for the present - day universe .",
    "@xmath54 is a dimensionless free parameter . the standard cosmological model , e.g. as in komatsu et al .",
    "@xcite , predicts a present matter density ratio @xmath55 . using this result and taking @xmath56 , we plot the dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath57 via redshifts @xmath58 in fig .  1 for our model and the standard @xmath59 model .",
    "we find they have nearly the same behavior .     with redshift @xmath58 .",
    "the solid line is for the standard @xmath59 model .",
    "the circled line is for our model.,width=245 ]    in order to show our model can lead to the cosmic acceleration , we plot the evolution of deceleration parameter @xmath60 : @xmath61 in fig .  2 .",
    "we find the model predicts nearly the same transition redshift @xmath62 as the standard @xmath59 model .     with redshift @xmath58 .",
    "the solid line is for the standard @xmath59 model .",
    "the circled line is for our model.,width=245 ]    at higher redshifts ( large @xmath63 ) , we have @xmath64",
    ". then eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq ] ) restores to the standard equation in general relativity .",
    "so the physics at and before the radiation dominated epoch is not modified . finally , let s calculate the debye acceleration @xmath0 : @xmath65 it is the order of @xmath66 of the gravitational field strength in the solar system and the order of @xmath67 for the galaxy system .",
    "so eq .  ( [ eq : gg ] )",
    "can be perfectly written as the newtonian law of gravity in the solar system and the galaxy scales . to show this point in great detail",
    ", we may observe the modified poisson s equation which is given by : @xmath68=4\\pi\\rho\\ ; ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the energy density of matter sources .",
    "@xmath71 is the newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "when @xmath64 , i.e. in the limit of strong gravitational field , we have @xmath72 which is for the newtonian gravity .",
    "so the deviation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : poi ] ) from newtonian gravity is embodied by the debye function . in fig .  3 , we plot the values of debye function in galaxy .",
    "the strength of gravitational field in the galaxy is around the order of @xmath73 of the debye acceleration @xmath0 .",
    "it then follows that the debye function @xmath74 in the galaxy such that the newtonian gravity emerges as a very good approximation .     with the strength of gravitational field @xmath75 in galaxy .",
    ", width=245 ]",
    "statistical thermodynamics tells us the equipartition law of energy does not hold in the limit of temperature approaching zero .",
    "it is found that the debye model is very successful in interpreting the physics of very low temperature system for most of the solid objects . since a gravitational system",
    "can also be taken as a thermodynamical system , we expect the equipartition law of energy for gravitational system shall break down in the limit of very low temperature ( or very low gravitational field strength ) .",
    "motivated by debye model , we modified the entropic force .",
    "we find the modification can interpret the current acceleration of the universe while without invoking any kind of dark energy .",
    "the model is closely related the debye acceleration @xmath0 .",
    "we find @xmath1 is consistent with cosmic observations very well .",
    "this gravitational field strength is very much smaller than the gravitational fields , by orders of @xmath76 in solar system and by orders of @xmath73 in the galaxy .",
    "therefore , the modified entropic force is not inconsistent with the solar system tests and the galaxy scale observations .",
    "then how to derive the debye model from the specific microscopic model of spacetime ?",
    "we leave this problem to future study .",
    "i am grateful to the referees for the insightful comments and suggestions , which have allowed me to improve this paper significantly .",
