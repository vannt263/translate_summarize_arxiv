    "clustering in strongly interacting fermi systems is a very important issue in many body physics .",
    "most well known is two body clustering , i.e. pairing , since it gives rise to superconductivity and superfluidity .",
    "much less studied is the phenomenon of formation of heavier clusters , like trions and quartets .",
    "these heavier clusters have so far mostly been relevant and studied in nuclear systems .",
    "this stems from the fact that in nuclear physics there are more than two species of fermions , i.e.  four different nucleons , which are the proton and neutron , both spin up or down .",
    "they all attract one another forming a strongly bound quartet , i.e.  the @xmath0 particle which is the smallest closed shell nucleus with a bosonic nature .",
    "it is known that @xmath0-clustering aspects as well as mean - filed aspects are essential features to understand the structure of light nuclei .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that certain states in self conjugate nuclei around the @xmath0 particle disintegration threshold can be described as product states of @xmath0 particles , all in the lowest @xmath1 state .",
    "we define a state of condensed @xmath0 particles in nuclei as a bosonic product state in good approximation , in which all bosons occupy the lowest quantum state of the corresponding bosonic mean field potential .",
    "a typical example is the hoyle state , @xmath2 state at @xmath3 mev in @xmath4c , the wave function of which is described by a product state of three @xmath0 s with @xmath5  % probability . in heavier @xmath6 nuclei",
    "hoyle - like states are predicted to exist in low density states , close to the @xmath7 disintegration threshold .",
    "studies on @xmath0 particle condensation are quite advanced  @xcite , but still many open questions and problems exist .",
    "we want to address a couple of them in this paper .",
    "theory predicts that analogues to the hoyle state in @xmath4c with its three @xmath0 particles condensed into a common @xmath1 orbit also should exist around the n@xmath0 threshold in heavier self conjugate nuclei  @xcite .",
    "we have made a prediction that the 6-th @xmath8 state at @xmath9 mev in @xmath10o should be such a state  @xcite . even without any calculations ,",
    "one realizes its strong similarity with the hoyle state :    i )  it is strongly excited by inelastic electron scattering and , thus , its monopole transition matrix element is quite large  @xcite , @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 : @xmath14 @xmath12 ) .",
    "ii )  it is situated just a couple of hundred kev above threshold : hoyle in @xmath4c at @xmath15 kev above threshold ( 7.27 mev ) , 6-th @xmath8 state @xmath16 kev above 4 @xmath0 particle threshold ( 14.4 mev ) .",
    "iii )  though the width of the 15.1 mev state in @xmath10o ( 160 kev ) is much larger than the one of the hoyle state ( 8.5 ev ) , it still is unusually small for a nuclear state so high up in energy .",
    "the width depends crucially on its position under the coulomb barrier .",
    "the 15.1 mev state in @xmath10o is about twice as much above threshold as the hoyle state .",
    "barrier height also may be lower in @xmath10o because of stronger coulomb repulsion of four vs three @xmath0 particles .",
    "more decay channels are open because of higher energy .",
    "still , they are not so many because shell model type of states have very little overlap with @xmath0 condensate states .",
    "though those features easily can explain the larger width in @xmath10o , it is still surprisingly small . unfortunately , measurements of the 15.1 mev state in @xmath10o are much less advanced than for the hoyle state .",
    "inelastic electromagnetic form factors are very much in need .",
    "the hoyle state has very clearly been identified from a three @xmath0 coincidence measurement  @xcite , hinting to its @xmath0-gas like structure . a 4@xmath0 coincidence measurement in @xmath10o with determination of the invariant mass ,",
    "would be extremely useful .",
    "hope comes from the analysis of an experiment at lns catania with the chimera detector with 4@xmath0 particle coincidences  @xcite .",
    "however , we need more experiments of this kind . also for more @xmath0 s .",
    "there are probably many states in @xmath10o which can be interpreted as excited states out of the condensate . a conspicuous rotational band at around 17 mev with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 with a very large moment of inertia is well known since several decades  @xcite .",
    "it also has recently been reanalyzed by freer et al .",
    "it is of great importance to study the cluster structures in the 15 - 18 mev range in greater detail .",
    "one may reasonably think that also @xmath21ne , @xmath22 mg possess @xmath0 gas states . the ikeda threshold  @xcite increases fast though : 19.17 mev for @xmath21ne , 28.48 mev for @xmath22 mg , 38.46 mev for @xmath23si , etc . if the experimenters were able to excite those nuclei into a large amplitude breathing mode , at some point surely they would cluster into a coherent state of @xmath0 particles .",
    "eventually for @xmath24 - @xmath25 @xmath0 s there will not exist a coulomb barrier any longer and the condensate gas will start to expand coherently as a soft coulomb explosion mode . there exist proposals to excite those large amplitude @xmath8 states by coulomb excitation with projectiles of relativistic energies  @xcite .",
    "some events related with the coulomb explosion are known in light nuclei since long from emulsion tracks  @xcite",
    ". a dream may be to dissociate @xmath26ca into 10 @xmath0 s . however",
    ", the @xmath7 nuclei need not to disintegrate totally into @xmath7 s . there may subsist a non disintegrated core , as e.g. @xmath27 , @xmath28 , etc .",
    "such situations have been discussed by von oertzen  @xcite , brenner  @xcite , and ogloblin  @xcite .",
    "still a clear finger print of such @xmath0 particle condensates on top of an inert core must be experimentally verified . however , in @xmath0 decay processes a bosonic enhancement seems having been seen  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 particle cluster physics excited nuclear physicist s imagination from the very early days when morinaga interpreted the hoyle state as a linear chain of three @xmath0 particles  @xcite .",
    "the linear chain structure of alpha clusters has been discussed by many people theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "famous examples are the ones of @xmath4c , @xmath10o , and @xmath22 mg . however , the states in @xmath4c and in @xmath22 mg which were assigned to have linear alpha - chain structures are now regarded to be inappropriate . for example , in @xmath4c , the hoyle state which is the second @xmath8 state at 7.65 mev , was assigned to have @xmath29 linear chain structure but it is now considered to have a @xmath29-gas - like structure . however , this does not mean that the existence of linear alpha - chain structures is impossible .",
    "in fact , in the case of @xmath4c , there are some reports that the third @xmath8 state around 10 mev has @xmath29 chain structure , although it is slightly bent away from the linear shape  @xcite    for the case of @xmath10o , as mentioned , chevalier et al .",
    "@xcite very early found a rotational band around 17 mev in @xmath10o with a huge moment of inertia which they said can only be understood if the corresponding state is interpreted as a linear chain of four @xmath0 particles . while many calculations have supported the idea of @xmath30 linear chain , there are some discussions with the @xmath30 ocm ( orthogonality condition model )  @xcite and potential model  @xcite which try to explain the rotational states of chevalier et al .  by relating them to the @xmath30 condensate state .",
    "about the existence of chains of six @xmath0 particles there is a rather recent discussion  @xcite .",
    "let us dwell a little further on these hypothetical linear chain states .",
    "the usual picture of the linear alpha - chain structure is expressed by the use of brink wave function which has alpha clusters located on a line with equal inter - cluster distances .",
    "this means that brink s description assumes a quasi rigid body picture of the chain state .",
    "one can improve the wave function by introducing small - amplitude oscillations of alpha clusters around their equilibrium positions .",
    "we now have some doubt about this common picture of linear alpha - chain structure on the basis of our experience with the investigation of alpha - condensate - like states expressed by the thsr ( tohsaki - horiuchi - schuck - rpke ) wave function  @xcite .",
    "our studies of alpha - condensate - like states teach us that , in three or many alpha systems , when alpha clusters are clearly separated , they do not necessarily keep any fixed geometrical arrangement but they move freely in the whole nuclear volume like a gas . from this knowledge",
    ", we can make the conjecture that the alpha clusters arranged on a line may move rather freely along the line instead of staying around some equilibrium points .",
    "we checked the validity of this conjecture in the case of three alpha clusters on a line in the following way .",
    "we calculated the energy obtained by the brink wave function with three alpha clusters arranged on a line with equal distance @xmath31 between neighboring clusters .",
    "let us denote the minimum energy with respect to @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",
    "next we calculated the energy obtained by a one - dimensional thsr wave function having the form ,    @xmath33 .\\ ] ]    let us denote the corresponding minimum energy with respect to @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "we found that @xmath35 is lower than @xmath32 by about 3.5 mev .",
    "this result supports our conjecture that even in a linear configuration the @xmath0 s can preferably be in a condensate . in condensed matter",
    "such linear bose condensates are called tonks - girardeau gases having quite particular properties  @xcite .",
    "this stems from the fact that the ideal compact bosons can not get around one another and , therefore , behave as hard core bosons .",
    "the fact that two bosons can not be on the same spot turns them effectively into fermions",
    ". it would be interesting to see to which extent such a feature also is born out in those linear chain condensates .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction has a rather strong short - range repulsion if the relative motion energy is not so high .",
    "thus we need to investigate whether this short - range repulsion remains active in the linear chain configuration of three or more @xmath0 s .",
    "we think that the alpha - condensate - like structure gives us new physics , even for the problem of linear chain structures of alpha clusters and we need further investigations in this direction .",
    "the linear chain structures probably are strongly stabilized if a couple of neutrons are added .",
    "actually the linear chain has recently be considered by itagaki et al .  in @xmath10c",
    "they concluded that there exists a specific molecular orbit configuration of four excess neutrons for which linear chain structure is stabilized especially for bending mode .",
    "in such a case , it would be extremely interesting whether the fact that extra neutrons are between three @xmath0 s hinders condensation to be born out to some extent or even totally , see also discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "but what about rings instead of chains ?",
    "such configurations also have been discussed very early in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we here want to show a very preliminary study of a constrained hfb calculation with the d1s force  @xcite .",
    "the constraint was to make the nucleus more and more oblate but the code allowed for spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry . at some point of low density the system preferred to break up into a ring of let s say eight @xmath0 particles for @xmath36s .",
    "but a ring with six @xmath0 s also has been found in the same way . the raw result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rings_32s ] . of course , the energies of these states which come from a pure mean field hfb calculation are much too high .",
    "however , the clustering probably is real .",
    "we have similar experience from the hoyle state . taking out the spurious center - of - mass ( c.o.m . )",
    "motion of the individual @xmath0 particles may bring down the energy to more realistic values .",
    "but their existence remains pure speculation for the moment .",
    "also the rings may considerably be stabilized by adding two neutrons per link . in the case of six @xmath0 s twelve neutrons",
    "may give the most binding .",
    "whether chains or rings are more stable is an open problem which , obviously , may depend on the number of @xmath0 s involved .",
    "we see that the chapter of @xmath0 chains or even rings is by far not closed and many things and surprises can be expected in the future .",
    "( @xmath37 ) ring structure in @xmath22 mg ( @xmath36s ) with constrained hfb calculations  @xcite.,width=529,height=302 ]",
    "besides the @xmath38 nuclei , one can expect cluster - gas states composed of alpha clusters with extra neutrons ( as well as deuterons and tritons etc . ) around their cluster disintegrated thresholds in @xmath39 nuclei , in which all clusters are in their respective @xmath1-orbits , similar to the hoyle state with the @xmath40 configuration .",
    "these states , thus , can be called `` hoyle - analogues '' in non - self - conjugated nuclei .",
    "it is an intriguing subject to investigate whether or not hoyle - analogue states exist in @xmath39 nuclei , for example for the simplest cases , @xmath41c ( @xmath42b ) , composed of @xmath29 s and one valence neutron ( @xmath43 s and one @xmath44 ) .",
    "the pertinent question is in which way the extra neutrons will influence the hoyle state .",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath45be when the two neutrons are in a @xmath46 orbit , see fig .",
    "[ fig:10be ] .",
    "for example is a brink type wave function more adequate for a gas - like state than a thsr wave function ? or , on the contrary , can we expect that such novel hoyle - like states have in addition to the @xmath0 particles also the extra neutrons in loosely bound @xmath1-orbits , not influencing very much the condensates ?",
    "the answer to these questions probably very much depends on how the extra neutrons arrange themselves around the @xmath0 particles .",
    "very likely , the most easy cases are the ones where one just has one extra neutron , like in @xmath47be or @xmath41c .",
    "the extra neutron in @xmath47be gives about 1.5 mev extra binding .",
    "an ocm calculation has recently been performed by yamada et al .",
    "@xcite for @xmath41c .",
    "the resulting picture concerning the hoyle - like states is the following . in the case of the valence neutron",
    "mainly in the @xmath48-orbit , the attractive effect of the @xmath48-wave @xmath0-@xmath49 interaction induces 1 )  a reduction of the nuclear radius of the hoyle state and 2 )  a strong coupling of the @xmath29 motion with the valence neutron , namely , the coupling of the cluster configurations such as @xmath4c(@xmath50)+@xmath49 and @xmath51be(@xmath52+@xmath0 etc .",
    "consequently , the @xmath29 condensate aspect in @xmath53 states of @xmath41c is significantly deteriorated , although the @xmath54 state around the @xmath29+@xmath49 threshold , corresponding to the 12.4-mev state recently observed by kawabata et al .",
    "@xcite , has a somewhat large component of the hoyle state in comparison with the other states .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of the valence neutrons mainly in the @xmath55-orbit , the situation is very different from the case of the neutron in the @xmath48-orbit , due to the weak attractive effect of the @xmath55-wave @xmath0-@xmath49 interaction .",
    "it should be recalled that the @xmath48-wave @xmath56 interaction produces the resonant states of @xmath57 and @xmath58 in @xmath59he , while the @xmath55-wave does not .",
    "the results of the ocm calculation show that the @xmath60 state ( corresponding to the 12.1-mev state ) around the @xmath61 threshold has a dilute condensate character , in which the three alpha clusters occupy an identical @xmath1 orbit with @xmath62 probability , indicating the state being a candidate of the hoyle - like state with the @xmath63 $ ] configuration .",
    "structure in @xmath45be . ]    the spin - orbit splitting in @xmath41c , @xmath57-@xmath58 , is also an interesting quantity to extract the information on the structure of the nuclear core , because the one - body spin - orbit potential for the extra neutron depends on the density distribution of the nuclear core .",
    "since the hoyle state has about triple volume with respect to the ground state , it can be expected that the spin - orbit splitting felt by an extra neutron is correspondingly weakened as compared with the one of the ground - state configuration  @xcite .",
    "thus , the spin - orbit splitting is one of the good tools to search for the hoyle state coupled with an extra neutron .    concerning the case of @xmath42b , a hoyle - analogue state with the main configuration of @xmath64 $ ]",
    "was explored with an ocm calculation  @xcite .",
    "it was indicated that the @xmath65-mev state ( @xmath66 ) around the @xmath67 threshold observed in the @xmath68li(@xmath69li,@xmath42b@xmath70)@xmath44 reaction etc .",
    "@xcite is a candidate for the hoyle - analogue state from the analyses of the single - cluster motions in @xmath42b .",
    "generally speaking one can expect that adding a lot of neutrons to hoyle like states will hinder their formation because of the pauli principle . in chains and rings , as discussed before , neutron pairs between the @xmath0 particle links may substantially stabilize those configurations .",
    "however , it is not clear whether these structures still show @xmath0 condensation aspects .",
    "the cluster composition of compact stars is another field where eventually condensation of @xmath0 particles may play a role .",
    "recent calculations  @xcite investigate the @xmath0 particle content of infinite nuclear matter as a function of density , asymmetry , and temperature .",
    "non - negligible @xmath0 particle mass fractions are found in certain parameter ranges  @xcite .",
    "the question then arises whether in these phases the @xmath0 s also form a condensate . in the past , we calculated critical temperatures for @xmath0 particle condensation in infinite symmetric nuclear matter studying a generalized thouless criterion for quartets .",
    "quite high values for @xmath71 were obtained .",
    "however , the thouless criterion applies for weak coupling situations and not for the strong coupling case with well established bosonic clusters .",
    "therefore , the high @xmath71 values obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite are questionable .",
    "if we treat the @xmath0 s as ideal elementary bosons , one obtains the following ideal bose gas relation for @xmath71 , @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the nucleon density . thus , @xmath71 = 1 mev occurs at the nucleon density @xmath73 = 0.02 @xmath74 .",
    "however , at that density interactions like the pauli blocking become of importance , and the ideal bose gas is no longer an adequate approximation .    for densities in the range ( 1/1000 - 1/10)@xmath75 , one obtains low values for @xmath71 .",
    "however , this also is not a realistic estimate .",
    "what is needed is an interpolation formula covering for quartet condensation the density dependence of @xmath71 from high ( weak coupling ) to very low and vanishing densities . only in the last situation",
    "the above formula is strictly valid . in the case of pairing such an interpolation scheme between strong and weak coupling",
    "has been proposed by nozires and schmitt - rink  @xcite .",
    "it would be very important to generalize this scheme to the quartet case . only then we can have a rough idea in which parameter range @xmath0 particle condensation can occur in compact stars , i.e. proto neutron stars , etc . in this context another interesting problem to solve is the transition , i.e. disappearance of @xmath0 particles with increasing density ( mott transition ) and appearance of ordinary superfluidity ( cooper pairing in the deuteron channel ) .",
    "the latter being more stable at high density  @xcite .",
    "the formation of @xmath0 matter and @xmath0 particle condensation in infinite matter is an important issue in deriving the nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) at subsaturation densities . in the low - temperature region , below the mott density the @xmath0 particles yield the dominating contribution to the composition of symmetric matter , if we restrict us to clusters with @xmath76 .",
    "below densities of the order 10@xmath77 @xmath74 , nuclear matter can be considered as an ideal mixture of free nucleons and clusters .",
    "the interaction between the constituents can be neglected .",
    "the mass action law gives increasing yield of @xmath78 particles at decreasing temperature for fixed density , but decreasing bound state concentration for decreasing density at fixed temperature ( entropy dissociation ) .",
    "the low - density limit at fixed temperature is the ideal classical gas of nucleons .",
    "corrections are given by the virial expansion .",
    "in particular , within a cluster - virial expansion the empirical scattering phase shifts can be used to evaluate density corrections for the ideal mixture of the different components .",
    "thus , the virial coefficient for @xmath79 interaction is obtained from the corresponding scattering phase shifts @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can use the phase shifts to introduce an effective interaction .",
    "the corresponding eos has been reconsidered recently @xcite , also taking into account the formation of a quantum condensate .",
    "the suppression of the @xmath0 condensate with increasing density was recently considered by funaki et al .",
    "@xcite in context with the formation of a condensate - like state in low - density nuclei and its disappearance with increasing density",
    ".    however , such effective interactions become questionable if the density is increasing so that the wave functions of the clusters overlap .",
    "then , pauli blocking leads to the dissolution of the clusters . instead of an effective @xmath0 particle interaction fitted to the scattering phase shifts , one has to go back to the constituent nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the antisymmetrization of the wave function and the account of the pauli exclusion principle become essential .",
    "calculations on that level have been performed only for a lattice of @xmath0 particles  @xcite .",
    "the full calculation for @xmath0 matter ( freely moving @xmath0 particles ) would give the energy per nucleon for symmetric matter in the low - density limit .",
    "furthermore , it would be of importance to calculate the @xmath0-pair distribution function in infinite matter , and to calculate the modification of the @xmath0 form factor at increasing nucleon density within such a first principle approach that includes the full antisymmetrization of the nucleon wave function .",
    "the relevance for finite dilute nuclei and the outer region of heavy nuclei is obvious .",
    "an important quantity is the binding energy per nucleon or , more generally , the nuclear matter eos . at very low densities ,",
    "the internal energy per nucleon takes the value @xmath80 for the classical ideal gas of free nucleons .",
    "when clusters are formed in nucleon gas with low temparature and very low density , the binding energy of the nucleons in clusters determines the internal energy . in the case of @xmath0 particles",
    "this contribution to the internal energy amounts to about @xmath81 mev .",
    "it determines the internal energy at zero temperature in the low - density limit .",
    "recently  @xcite appropriate approaches to the eos have been investigated , to be of use in supernova explosion calculations .",
    "with increasing density , the pauli blocking leads to a reduction of the binding energy of the @xmath0 particles and its dissolution .",

    "above the mott density , after the bound states are dissolved , the free nucleon relativistic mean field approach or similar effective quasiparticle approaches give the behavior of the internal energy .",
