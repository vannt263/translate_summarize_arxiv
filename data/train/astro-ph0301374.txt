    "stars more massive than about @xmath0 end their life as supernova , leaving a compact remnant - a neutron star or a black hole . generally speaking ,",
    "the evolution of such a star follows a well understood path of contraction to increasing central density and temperature .",
    "this path of contraction is interrupted by nuclear fusion  first hydrogen to helium , then helium to carbon and oxygen , followed by carbon , neon , oxygen , and silicon burning , until finally a core of iron is produced .",
    "each fuel burns first in the center of the star , then in one or more shells . in table  1",
    "we summarize the burning stages and their durations for a @xmath1 star .",
    "the time scale for helium burning is about ten times shorter than that of hydrogen burning , mostly because of the lower energy release per unit mass .",
    "the time scale of the burning stages and contraction beyond central helium - burning is greatly reduced by thermal neutrino losses that carry away energy _ in situ _ , instead of requiring that it be transported to the stellar surface by diffusion or convection .",
    "these losses increase with temperature as roughly @xmath2 ( see woosley , heger & weaver for a more extended review ) .",
    "when the star has built up a large enough iron core , exceeding its effective chandrasekhar mass , it collapses to form a neutron star or a black hole",
    ". a supernova explosion may result ( e.g. , colgate & white 1966 ) , or , in rare cases , a gamma - ray burst ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; macfadyen , woosley , & heger 2001 ) .",

    "characteristic values of the equatorial rotation velocity on the main sequence are around @xmath8 ( fukuda 1982 ; and other contributions in these proceedings ) . in this paper , we address what happens to the rotation in the interior of these stars as they evolve . in general , the ongoing contraction leads to faster rotation , but transport processes ( circulation , viscosity , magnetic fields , etc . )",
    "lead to loss of angular momentum from the stellar core .",
    "we are particularly interested in the model predictions for the rotational periods of the collapsed remnants left by the supernova .",
    "on the main sequence , massive stars quickly settle into rigid rotation ( e.g. , zahn 1992 ; talon et al .",
    "1997 , meynet & maeder 2000 ; maeder & meynet 2000 ) .",
    "contraction increases the rotational energy faster than gravitational binding energy and would eventually make the core unstable to triaxial deformations ( ostriker & bodenheimer 1973 ) . without the transport of angular momentum , for typical initial rotation rates , this would happen during central helium burning , but clearly the transport of angular momentum in the stellar interior can not be neglected .",
    "important processes for angular momentum transport include hydrodynamic instabilities ( convection , shear , circulation , etc . ; see , e.g. , endal & sofia 1978 ; knobloch & spruit 1983 ; heger , langer , woosley 2000 ; tassoul 2000 ) and magnetic fields ( e.g. , spruit & phinney 1998 ; spruit 2002 ) .",
    "the instabilities , however , are inhibited by thermal , and , most importantly , compositional stratification inside the star ( e.g. , kippenhahn 1974 , knobloch & spruit 1983 ; maeder & meynet 1997 ; maeder 2003 ) .    early calculations by kippenhahn & thomas ( 1970 ) ; kippenhahn , meyer - hofmeister , & thomas ( 1970 ) and by endal & sofia ( 1976 ) that ignored angular momentum transport , or only included it in chemically homogeneous regions , did indeed find that the star became secularly unstable at the end of central helium burning or reached critical rotation before central carbon burning .",
    "later models by endal & sofia ( 1978 ) , that considered eddington - sweet circulation ( eddington 1924 , 1929 ; vogt 1925 ) , shear instabilities ( e.g. , zahn 1974 , 1975 ; maeder 1997 ) , gsf instability ( goldreich & schubert 1967 ; fricke 1968 ) , and solberg - hiland instability ( wasiutyski 1946 ) found significant transport of angular momentum that allowed their stars to go well beyond central carbon burning without reaching the limit of secular instability .",
    "still the models rotated about three times faster , after central helium burning , than the more recent models of heger , langer & woosley ( 2000 ) .",
    "this more recent study reduced the efficiency of composition gradients in inhibiting instabilities and of compositional mixing relative to angular momentum transport ( pinsonneault et al .",
    "1989 ; chaboyer & zahn 1992 ) in order to reproduce observed stellar surface abundance anomalies ( e.g. , giess & lambert 1992 ; venn et al . 2002 ) .",
    "calculations by the geneva group also found , after central helium burning , rotation rates similar to those of heger et al .",
    "( 2000 ; maeder , private communication ) and the most recent calculations by hirschi , meynet , & maeder ( 2003 ) find comparable rotation rates during oxygen shell burning , @xmath9 in @xmath10 star of initially @xmath11 compared to @xmath12 for a star with initially @xmath13 in heger et al .",
    "others have also studied massive star rotation , but concentrated on the main sequence and helium burning ( e.g. , urpin , shalybkov , & spruit 1996 ; talon & zahn 1997 ; denissenkov , ivanova , & weiss 1999 ) .",
    ".evolution of the internal stellar rotation for a @xmath10 star .",
    "the first column gives the evolution stage ( see explanation below ) , the second column gives the central density at this evolution stage , the 3@xmath14 column gives the specific angular momentum at a mass coordinate of @xmath15 , and the last three columns give the radius , the angular velocity , and it s ratio to local keplerian angular velocity at this point . for the neutron star ( ns )",
    "we have put the values in excess of critical rotation in brackets . [ cols= \"",
    "< , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      +    during hydrogen burning , angular momentum loss by stellar winds and the contraction of a core bounded by an expanding envelope leads to angular momentum loss from the core . as a gradient in mean molecular weight develops , however , angular momentum gets `` trapped '' in the core and differential rotation develops between the core and envelope . by the end of central helium burning ,",
    "rotation in the core is reduced by another factor of two .",
    "this is , in part , because the growing core incorporates material of low angular momentum that had been slowed down during the first dredge - up , and , in part , due to angular momentum transport .",
    "after central helium burning , hydrodynamic rotationally - induced instabilities are not fast enough for significant angular momentum transport ( see above ) and angular momentum is essentially locally trapped in the cores of different composition .",
    "only convection is fast enough to redistribute angular momentum over larger regions of the stars and the rigidly rotating convective shells leave an imprint in the rotation profile that are each characterized by a steep drop of the specific angular momentum at its base since , typically , the inner radius of such a shells is much smaller than its outer radius .    in the case of a @xmath10 star ( solar metallicity ) with an initial rotation rate of @xmath13 the core spins fast enough to form a neutron star in excess of critical rotation ( last line of table  2 ) if no further loss of angular momentum occurs . since rotation close to breakup clearly is in contradiction to the rotation rates of young pulsars ( table  3 ) some additional spin - down is necessary .",
    "however , this much rotation in collapsing massive star cores would be preferable for the `` collapsar '' model for gamma - ray bursts ( woosley 1993 ) . for some time",
    ", the @xmath16-mode instability ( e.g. , lindblom , tohline , & vallisneri 2001 ) seemed to be a promising explanation for spin - down , so that both slow pulsars and collapsars could result from rapidly rotating core , but recent evaluation ( arras et al . 2003 ) seem to indicate that it may be not efficient enough ( see also woosley & heger 2003 in these proceedings ) .",
    "an alternative possibility for removing this discrepancy may be angular momentum transport by magnetic fields .",
    "spruit & phinney ( 1998 ) assumed that differential rotation would torque an initially arbitrarily weak radial field component into a toroidal field , that , when strong enough , would become unstable , producing a new radial field that is wound up again . with such strong fields they obtained a star that was kept in rigid rotation until about central carbon burning and estimated pulsar rotation rates at birth @xmath17 result .",
    "if mass loss is taken into account , the resulting spin would have been even lower by orders of magnitude .",

    "it is assumed that the dynamo reaches a steady state field on a time - scale short compared to that on which the structure and rotation profile of the star evolve . from this dynamo and its equilibrium field",
    "an effective diffusivity for chemical mixing and an effective viscosity for angular momentum transport can be derived ( spruit 2002 ) .",
    "we have implemented both as time - dependent diffusive processes ( heger , woosley , & spruit 2003 ) . the results for a @xmath10 model with the same initial properties as in figure  1 and table  2 , but now including the dynamo process , is given in figure  2 and table  4 . at the end of central hydrogen burning",
    "the star is essentially still in solid body rotation ",
    "the small steps seen in figure  1 between @xmath24 , marking the composition gradient left behind by central hydrogen burning , are not present  and it rotates significantly slower . by the end of central helium burning ,",
    "the core is slowed down even further . at this point",
    "it rotates at less than a tenth the speed of the non - magnetic star . from here to core collapse the angular momentum in the inner @xmath25 is reduced by an additional factor @xmath26 . despite significant differential rotation , essentially no angular momentum is transported across the edge of the helium core where entropy strongly increases . in table  4 we also give the central angular velocity at late evolution stages until core collapse along with the equilibrium radial and toroidal magnetic fields .",
    "this compilation demonstrates an important property of of spruit s model : the radial field component is much weaker than the toroidal field component .",
    "this is also one of the significant differences with the model of spruit & phinney ( 1998 ) . from these stellar models we obtain neutron star rotation rates of @xmath27 for @xmath28 stars assuming all the angular momentum in the core",
    "were conserved to for a neutron star ( table  5 ) and the remnants of more massive stars are rotating faster .",
    "these rotation rates are still faster than that of observed young pulsars ( table  4 ) and additional spin - down mechanisms are still needed to reduce the discrepancy ( see woosley & heger 2003 in these proceedings ) . in the derivation of the dynamo model by spruit ( 2002 ) several quantities of `` comparable size ''",
    "have been set equal , introducing parameters `` of the order unity '' in the theory .",
    "most significant for the angular momentum transport and the presence of effective barriers , like the edge of the helium core mentioned above , are the influence of stabilization of the stratification by thermal and compositional buoyancy .",
    "we have varied both , as well as the overall magnetic stress from the dynamo by a factor 10 up and down ( table  6 ) .",
    "even these large variation only result in variations of the neutron star rotation by about a factor @xmath29 .",
    "the reason for the smallness of the effect is that the stress resulting from the dynamo scales as the 6@xmath30 power of the shear rate .",
    "without the action of magnetic fields , hydrodynamic rotationally - induced instabilities and convection alone ( figure  1 ) do not transport angular momentum efficiently enough to avoid forming pulsars rotating at break up ( assuming that most of the angular momentum is conserved during the collapse ; table  2 ) . when a dynamo process like that of spruit ( 2002 ) is included in the models ( table  4 and figure  2 ) , one obtains pulsar periods more than a factor 10 slower , about @xmath31 ( table  5 ) . though these periods may still increase by @xmath32 due to neutrino losses from the proto - neutron star , they are still too fast compared even to the fastest - rotating observed young pulsars ( table  3 ) and additional spin - down mechanisms may still be needed in single stars ( see woosley & heger 2003 in these proceedings )",
    ". however , the rotation rates found in the magnetic stellar models would be too slow for most current gamma - ray burst models which require rapidly rotating stellar cores .",
    "however , interacting close binary stars may lead to much faster or slower core rotation , and , e.g. , to pulsars of up to a second spin period ( langer et al .",
