    "it should be noted that the inverse problem solution of the planet transits is not a trivial task .",

    "these results imply that the determination of the planet temperature from the observed transits is forthcoming . until such observational precision",
    "is reached the code tac - maker could be used for theoretical investigations of the effects of different thermal processes ( as ohmic heating , tidal heating , internal energy sources , etc . ) on the planet transits .",
    "although the analytical solutions of the problems are very useful , the modern astrophysical objects and configurations are quite complex to allow analytical descriptions . instead of analytical solutions we are now able to use fast numerical computations .",
    "this paper presents a new solution of the direct problem of the transiting planets .",
    "it is based on the transformation of the double integrals describing the light decrease during the transit to linear ones .",
    "we created the code tac - maker for generation of synthetic transits by numerical calculations of the linear integrals .",
    "the validation of our approach was made by comparison with the results of the wide - spread method for modelling of planet transits .",
    "it was demonstrated that our method gave reasonable and expected synthetic transits for linear , quadratic and squared - root limb - darkening laws and arbitrary combinations of input parameters .",
    "the main advantages of our approach for the planet transits are :    ( 1 ) : :    it gives a possibility , for the first time , to use an arbitrary    limb - darkening law @xmath106 ) of the host star ; ( 2 ) : :    it allows acquisition of the stellar limb - darkening coefficients from    the transit solution and comparison with the theoretical values of    @xcite ; ( 3 ) : :    it gives a possibility , in principle , to determine the planet    temperature from the observed transits .",
    "our estimations reveal that    the effect of the non - zero planet temperature to the transit depth is    lower than the precision of the present optical photometric    observations .",
    "however , the higher sensibility of the observations at    longer wavelengths ( ir ) to the planet emission implies that the    determination of the planet temperature from the observed transits is    forthcoming .",
    "these properties of our approach and the practically arbitrary precision of the calculations of the code tac - maker reveal that our solution of the planet transit problem is able to meet the challenges of the continuously increasing photometric precision of the ground - based and space observations .",
    "we plan to build an inverse problem solution for the planet transit ( for determination of the configuration parameters ) on the basis of our direct problem solution and by using the derived simple analytical expressions in this paper to obtain initial values of the fitted parameters .",
    "the code tac - maker is available for free download from the astrophysics source code library or its own site .",
    "the research was supported partly by funds of projects do  02 - 362 , do  02 - 85 , and ddvu 02/40 - 2010 of the bulgarian scientific foundation .",
    "we are very grateful to eric agol , the referee of the manuscript , for the valuable recommendations and useful notes .",
