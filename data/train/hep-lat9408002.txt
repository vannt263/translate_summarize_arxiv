    "<S> we calculate both connected and disconnected contribution to the @xmath0-@xmath1 @xmath2-term in quenched lattice qcd with wilson quark action on a @xmath3 lattice at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is evaluated with the aid of the variant wall source method , which was previously applied successfully for extraction of @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering lengths and @xmath5 meson mass . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the disconnected contribution is about twice larger than the connected one . </S>",
    "<S> the value for the full @xmath0-@xmath1 @xmath2 term @xmath6 mev is consistent with the experimental estimates . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon matrix element of the strange quark density @xmath7 is fairly large in our result .    </S>",
    "<S> = 23.5 cm = 14.7 cm = -0.7 cm = -0.77 in    @xmath8 also at _ </S>",
    "<S> institute for advanced study , princeton , nj 08540 , u. s. a. _    study of the @xmath0-@xmath1 @xmath2-term defined as the nucleon matrix element of the scalar density , @xmath9 has a long history and still shows some controversy . </S>",
    "<S> current algebra and pcac relates the @xmath2 term to the quantity @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the crossing even @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering amplitude at the cheng - dashen point @xmath12 , and a dispersion analysis of @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering leads to the value @xmath13mev@xcite mev . on the other hand , treating the flavor symmetry breaking to first order , one finds @xmath14 with @xmath15 mev and @xmath16@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two estimates can not be reconciled unless the nucleon has an unexpectedly large strangeness content @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> a possible resolution is that the variation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 amplitude from the cheng - dashen point @xmath12 to @xmath18 , where the @xmath2 term ( [ eq : sigmaterm ] ) is defined , is substantial , resulting in a smaller value @xmath19mev@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the suggestion@xcite that one - loop chiral perturbative corrections raises the value of @xmath20 to @xmath21mev , this would imply a more reasonable value @xmath22 of the nucleon strangeness content .    in principle lattice qcd </S>",
    "<S> provides a more direct and more satisfactory route for resolving the issue through a numerical calculation of the @xmath2 term matrix element . a serious technical obstacle </S>",
    "<S> , however , has been that evaluation of the disconnected amplitude of quark loops and nucleon propagators projected onto the zero momentum state shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) would require a prohibitively large number of quark matrix inversions if one were to carry it out with the conventional method of point source . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we show that the variant of the method of wall source without gauge fixing , which has been successfully applied for calculation of @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering lengths@xcite and @xmath5 meson mass@xcite , also works well for the disconnected contribution to the @xmath2 term . employing the wilson quark action </S>",
    "<S> , we find an encouraging result , @xmath23mev , from an estimate of the matrix element and the up and down quark masses , or @xmath24mev from that of @xmath25 , albeit within quenched qcd at a fairly strong coupling of @xmath4 with the lattice spacing @xmath26fm .    </S>",
    "<S> let us note that previous estimates of the connected contribution in quenched qcd yielded values in the range @xmath27 mev@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the derivative @xmath28 in quenched qcd , equal to the @xmath2 term via the hellmann - feynman theorem , also gave similar values@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results were considered reasonable ; sea quarks are absent in the quenched approximation , and hence one expects @xmath29mev . </S>",
    "<S> this already suggested that the disconnected contribution is substantial . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we find @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> previous attempts for estimating the disconnected contribution in full qcd , made either indirectly through a comparison of the slope @xmath28 and the connected contribution@xcite or through the noisy estimator for quark loop@xcite , indicated that the disconnected contribution is as large as the connected one . </S>",
    "<S> however , both results suffered from significant errors so that reaching a reliable conclusion was difficult . </S>",
    "<S> we should add that the large disconnected contribution poses a problem regarding the strangeness content , which we shall comment upon toward the end of this article .    to extract the nucleon matrix element of the scalar density @xmath31 we calculate the ratio of the three - point function of the nucleon and scalar density to the nucleon two - point function , each projected onto the zero momentum state@xcite , @xmath32 with @xmath33 the lattice renormalization factor for the scalar density . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath18 time slice is excluded from the sum in the numerator since we fix the @xmath18 time slice of gauge configurations to the coulomb gauge to enhance nucleon signals . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure affects only the constant term in ( [ eq : ratio ] ) . the connected amplitude ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) can be calculated by the conventional source method@xcite . to handle the disconnected piece ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ) we prepare a quark propagator evaluated with unit source at every space - time site ( except for the @xmath18 time slice ) without gauge fixing@xcite ; @xmath34 the product of the nucleon propagator and @xmath35 $ ] equals the disconnected amplitude up to gauge - variant non - local terms which cancel out in the average over gauge configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the superior feature of this method is that it requires only two quark matrix inversions for each gauge configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we note that with the exclusion of the @xmath36 term in ( [ eq : stwall ] ) , the fierz mixing of the quark propagator ( [ eq : stwall ] ) for the disconnected loop and nucleon valence quark propagators is automatically avoided .    </S>",
    "<S> we have applied the method for the wilson quark action in quenched qcd at @xmath4 on a @xmath3 lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed 300 configurations for the hopping parameter @xmath37 , @xmath38 and 400 configurations for @xmath39 , generated with the single plaquette action separated by 1000 pseudo - heat bath sweeps . in order to avoid contaminations from the negative - parity partner of the nucleon propagating backward in time </S>",
    "<S> we employ the dirichlet boundary condition in the temporal direction for quark propagators . </S>",
    "<S> we used the relativistic nucleon operator @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> errors are estimated by the single elimination jackknife procedure .    in fig .  2 the ratio @xmath41 is plotted for the connected and disconnected amplitudes as a function of @xmath42 for the case of @xmath37 and 0.1665 . </S>",
    "<S> for the connected amplitude we observe a clear linear increase with very small errors of less than 12% up to @xmath43 as has been known from previous work@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> signals are also reasonable , albeit worse , for the disconnected amplitude , and are consistent with a linear behavior in @xmath42 up to @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the disconnected amplitude is even larger than that of the connected one , indicating a substantial contribution from the disconnected amplitude to the @xmath2 term . to extract the scalar density matrix element we fit the data to the linear form ( [ eq : ratio ] ) with the fitting range chosen to be @xmath44 . in table  1 </S>",
    "<S> we tabulate the fitted values of the matrix elements corrected by the tadpole - improved renormalization factor in the @xmath45 scheme at the scale @xmath46 given by@xcite @xmath47 where we used @xmath48 for @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> we present the quark mass dependence of the matrix element @xmath50 in fig .  3 as functions of the bare quark mass @xmath51 using @xmath52@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the disconnected contribution ( circles ) is about twice as large as the connected contribution and increases almost linearly toward small quark masses , while the connected contribution remains constant . extrapolating linearly in the quark mass , we find @xmath53 for the disconnected contribution , 2.62(6 ) for the connected piece , and 8.6(1.4 ) for the sum at @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the value for the connected contribution is reasonably consistent with the value of the derivative @xmath55 obtained by fits of the nucleon mass in the range @xmath56 where our calculations are made .    </S>",
    "<S> an estimate of the @xmath2 term in physical units requires the value of the bare mass@xcite @xmath57 for the up and down quark and the physical scale of lattice spacing . from fits of the meson spectrum </S>",
    "<S> obtained on our set of gauge configurations , we find @xmath58 , @xmath59 , from which we obtain @xmath60 and @xmath61gev using @xmath62mev and @xmath63mev . </S>",
    "<S> these values yield @xmath23mev , showing an encouraging agreement with the dispersion theoretic estimate of the @xmath2 term . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively one can form the dimensionless ratio @xmath25 at each quark mass and extrapolate to the chiral limit . the ratio turned out to depend little on @xmath64 , and a linear extrapolation gives @xmath65 or @xmath24mev with the physical nucleon and pions masses . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the two values of @xmath2 originates from the fact that @xmath66 at @xmath4 , taken for the present simulation , is larger than the experimental value 1.22 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us turn our attention to the nucleon matrix element of the strange quark density @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> this matrix element receives contribution only from the disconnected amplitude . for an extraction of its physical value one needs to extrapolate the valence quark mass to the chiral limit keeping the strange quark mass fixed . in table  2 </S>",
    "<S> we summarize the results for the matrix element @xmath67 corrected by the tadpole - improved @xmath68 factor relevant for such an analysis . </S>",
    "<S> results of a linear extrapolation to the chiral limit for the valence quark are also listed in table  2 . </S>",
    "<S> fitting the extrapolated values for three values of @xmath69 we obtain @xmath70 .    </S>",
    "<S> the strange quark mass may be estimated by generalizing the relation @xmath71 to @xmath72 and using the experimental ratio @xmath73 , which yields @xmath74 or @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> we then obtain @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> two quantities of physical interest that can be estimated from this result are the strange quark contribution to the nucleon mass @xmath77 and the @xmath78-@xmath1 @xmath2 term @xmath79 @xmath80mev . while these results appear quite reasonable , </S>",
    "<S> we need to note that the value of the matrix element @xmath67 itself is large . </S>",
    "<S> combined with our result @xmath81 for the up and down quark , we find @xmath82 , while a phenomenological estimate gives @xmath22@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have not identified an apparent origins of systematic errors that lead to the result , perhaps except for a possible scaling violation as our simulation is made at a rather strong coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this point should be examined through a repetition of the calculation with a smaller lattice spacing , which we leave for future investigations .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize we have shown that the method of wall source without gauge fixing@xcite helps to overcome the computational difficulty of yet another quantity , the disconnected contribution to the @xmath0-@xmath1 @xmath2 term , for which we obtained @xmath6mev with a 15% error at a lattice spacing @xmath83fm . our results also show a large strangeness content in the nucleon . </S>"
