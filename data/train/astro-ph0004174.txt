    "brown dwarfs ( bd ) provide the opportunity of extending classical studies of stellar properties into the hitherto unexplored realm of objects with masses lower than the h - burning limit ( 0.075  m@xmath1 ; e.g. baraffe et al . 1998 ) .",
    "stars are frequently associated with other stars in multiple systems .",
    "57% of nearby g - type dwarfs have h - burning companions ( abt & levy 1976 ; duquennoy & mayor 1991 , hereafter dm91 ) .",
    "the multiplicity frequency seems to be lower among nearby m - type dwarfs ( 38% , henry & mccarthy 1990 ; fisher & marcy 1992 ) .",
    "this difference could be due to the smaller mass range available for the stellar secondaries of m dwarfs .",
    "on the other hand , the distribution of binary separations is similar for g- and m - type stars .",
    "it has a broad maximum from 3 to 30 astronomical units ( au ) .",
    "there is no indication that stellar binary properties depend on primary mass .",
    "stellar clusters are important for studying the multiplicity properties as a function of age , metallicity and mass",
    ". one of the best studied open clusters is the pleiades .",
    "it is nearby ( d=125  pc ) , young ( 120  myr ) , the metallicity is close to solar , and there are more than 800 known members ( see hambly 1998 for a review ) . the pleiades mass function has been studied over a broad mass range , from 4  m@xmath1 to 0.04  m@xmath1 ( hambly , hawkins & jameson 1993 ; meusinger , schilbach & souchay 1996 ; bouvier et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter b98 ) .",
    "cluster bds have been confirmed via the lithium test ( basri , marcy & graham 1996 ; rebolo et al .",
    "several imaging surveys have recently identified a numerous population of pleiades bd candidates ( b98 ; festin 1998 ; zapatero osorio et al .",
    "1999 ; hambly et al .",
    "follow - up observations of these objects is necessary for assessing their membership .",
    "the search for bd binaries is interesting because of the following reasons : 1 ) any fainter and cooler secondary of a bd should have even lower mass than the primary .",
    "2 ) the binary frequency among bds and the distribution of orbital periods and eccentricities is an important clue for understanding the formation of these objects .",
    "3 ) bd binaries provide the opportunity to measure dynamical masses , which are necessary for calibrating evolutionary models .",
    "4 ) the pleiades substellar mass function needs to be corrected for binarity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the observations and describe the data analysis . in section 3",
    "we search for companions and we construct color magnitude diagrams . in section 4",
    "we discuss the cluster membership of our objects , we derive parameters for the likely members , we estimate the binary frequency , and we discuss the implications of our results for the substellar mass function .",

    "we observed a total of 30 objects , but one of them was a repetition ( ppl1=roque15 ) .    for the ground - based near - ir and spectroscopic observations , we selected all the cfht objects that had not been observed in previous campaigns .",
    "we obtained near - ir photometry for 22 objects and spectroscopy for 17 .",
    "the targets were centered in the field of view of the nicmos camera 1 ( nic1 ) .",
    "exposures of 447.95  s , 383.95  s and 383.95  s were obtained in multiple - accumulate mode with filters f110 m , f145 m , and f165 m ( thompson et al .",
    "1998 ) , respectively .",
    "each target was observed during one orbit ( average visibility 52 minutes ) .",
    "we used the iraf / digiphot package for data reduction and analysis .",
    "magnitudes for all the targets were computed based on the header keyword photfnu and are given in table  1 .",
    "these values should be used with caution because the values for photfnu are valid for sources with a constant flux per unit wavelength across the band pass , which might not be the case for our sources .",
    "other limiting factors in the accuracy of the magnitudes are that we used model point spread functions ( psf ) for fitting the data that did not always provide a perfect match to the observed psf , and uncertainties in the nicmos darks and resulting spatial variations in the background .",
    "we used on - orbits darks ( as opposed to the model darks used in the standard nicmos pipeline ) to improve the photometric accuracy , but the correction was still not perfect .",

    "integration times ranged from 100 to 150 seconds in jhk broad - band filters .",
    "images were dark and flat - field corrected and aperture photometry performed with iraf / apphot .",
    "ukirt faint standards were observed every night for photometric calibration . for 10 of the 12 cfht candidates observed during this run ( see table 2 ) , the adaptive optics system provided an angular resolution of 0.2 to 0.3 arcsec fwhm .",
    "the 2 remaining objects , cfht-17 and 18 , had no proper ao guiding star and have 0.4 - 0.5 arcsec fwhm on the final images .",
    "we obtained spectra using the keck  ii telescope with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke et al .",

    "the observing log is given in table  3 .",
    "we rotated the slit in order to be at parallactic angle at the beginning of the exposure in order to minimize refraction losses .",
    "all the ccd frames were bias subtracted , flat fielded , sky subtracted , and variance extracted using routines within iraf .",
    "we calibrated in wavelength using the emission spectrum of hgnear lamps .",
    "correction for instrumental response was made using spectra obtained in the same night of flux standards with fluxes available in the iraf environment .",
    "we did not use order - blocking filters for the keck observations of the pleiades bd candidates .",
    "these objects are so red that second - order contamination is negligible .",
    "we observed vb10 without filter and with the og570 order - blocking filter .",
    "we did not find any significant contamination due to second - order light .",
    "we calibrated the lris spectra with the flux standard star bd+262606 , which was observed the same night as the pleiades bd candidates and with same instrumental configuration .",
    "the spectrum of the standard star obtained without filter was used blueward of 680  nm , and that obtained with the og570 filter was used redward of 680  nm . at kpno",

    "fig .  1 shows a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd hereafter ) in the nicmos f110 m and f165 m filters .",
    "the f145 m filter is strongly affected by water vapour in the spectrum of very cool objects .",

    ", a t@xmath8 of 2800  k corresponds to a mass of 0.075  m@xmath1 and m@xmath9=10.31 .",
    "the effect of dust formation in fig .",
    "1 is to make the objects bluer than the nextgen isochrone because of `` backwarming '' ( e.g. leggett , allard & hauschildt 1998 ) .",
    "we start seeing clear evidence for a turnover to bluer colors in the pleiades sequence at m@xmath1011.5 , which corresponds to a t@xmath8=2320  k. hence , we find that for t@xmath8 lower than about 2300  k , dust becomes an important opacity source in the atmospheres of pleiades bds .",
    "the dusty isochrone gives a good fit to the position of our faintest object ( roque  25 , spt = l0 ) .",
    "intermediate models between nextgen and dusty are not available .",
    "they seem to be required to fit the location of pleiades bds between m@xmath1011.5 and m@xmath1012 .",
    "all of our targets with previously known lithium detections are located close ( f110m - f165m=@xmath110.2 mag ) to the nextgen isochrone in fig .  1 .",
    "these lithium bds are bona - fide pleiades members and help to define the cluste sequence .",
    "they are : cfht - pl  15 , mho  3 , ppl  1 , roque  13 , teide  1 and teide  2 .",
    "calar  3 has not been plotted because the photometry is very uncertain due to guiding problems .",
    "ppl  1 was observed with nic1 at two different epochs ( 1 sep 1998 and 9 sep 1998 ) because we had not realized that it is actually the same object as roque  15 ( zapatero osorio et al .",
    "1997c did not notice it neither ) .",
    "we obtained different magnitudes for the two sets of observations ( table  1 ) . in the second epoch",
    "the object was brighter and bluer .",
    "we have marked the variation in the location of ppl  1 in the cmd of fig .  1 .",
    "the difference is much larger in the f145 m filter ( 8  @xmath12 ) than in the other two filters , suggesting variability in the steam absorption .",
    "this could be a hint of a `` weather '' change in the brown dwarf .",
    "periodic photometric variability has been observed in i - band ccd observations of two cluster vlm stars , one in @xmath13per ( martn & zapatero osorio 1997 ) and the other in the pleiades ( terndrup et al .",
    "the light changes in these stars are probably due to surface thermal inhomogeneities ( dark spots ) modulated by the rotation of the object(s ) . on the other hand ,",
    "bailer - jones & mundt ( 1999 ) have recently failed to detect photometric variability in calar  3 , roque  11 and teide  1 .",
    "further photometric monitoring of ppl  1 is necessary to clarify if the observed variability in nicmos filters is due to weather or magnetic spots .",
    "the example of ppl  1 indicates that some of the spread observed in the pleiades sequence of fig .  1 could be due to intrinsic variability of the objects .",
    "other sources of scatter in the cmd are unresolved binaries and non - members of the cluster .",
    "we note two examples of each kind of object .",
    "cfht  pl  16 is brighter and redder than the rest of the sequence .",

    "cfht  pl  22 is much bluer and fainter than the pleiades sequence .",
    "it is likely a non - member .",
    "the membership status of our sample is discussed in detail in section 4.1 .",

    "we used the following extinction corrections for all the objects : a@xmath14=0.06 , a@xmath15=0.01 .",
    "we have compared the data with theoretical isochrones ( ages=100 and 120  myr ) .",
    "dusty and nextgen models are represented with dashed and solid lines , respectively .",
    "there is a well defined observational sequence , which is conveniently fitted by the the nextgen isochrones down to m@xmath16=14 .",
    "our faintest object , roque  25 , is bluer than the dust - free isochrone .",
    "its location in fig .",
    "3 is in good agreement with the dusty isochrone .",
    "this is explained by the greenhouse effect of dust grains ( chabrier et al .",

    "if cfht - pl  18 is indeed a member , both components should have preserved their initial lithium content because they are fainter than the pleiades substellar boundary ( martn et al .",

    "we put an upper limit to the lii equivalent width of 200 ma , which is a factor of 5 lower than the equivalent width ( ew ) measured in teide  1 ( rebolo et al .",
    "1996 ) , and a factor 2.5 lower than the ew measured in ppl  15 ( basri et al .",

    "1998 ) , we obtain a spectroscopic parallax of 105  pc .",
    "the projected separation of the binary would then be 34.5  au .",
    "cfht - pl  16 is located more than 0.5 mag above the pleiades sequence in all the cmds .",

    "we estimate that the probability of having a noise feature at the position of the lii line is @xmath310% , i.e. low but not negligible .",
    "we measured a heliocentric radial velocity of 13@xmath115 km / s using the h@xmath19 feature , which is consistent with the radial velocities of vlm pleiades members ( martn et al .",
    "1998b ) .",
    "since the nicmos psf can vary significantly from one hst orbit to the next , we used all of the hst / nicmos pointings to build up a library of hst / nic1 psfs in all three filters ( f110 m , f145 m , anf f165 m ) .",
    "for each set of observation , we then identified the best matching psf in the library for psf subtraction .",

    "because of the low - resolution of most of our spectra , the nai doublet at 818.3 and 819.0  nm is blended with telluric absorption and we can not derive an accurate equivalent width .",

    ". we have minimized the dependence of our results on the role of dust in the atmosphere by using the filters that show less sensitivity to the choice of model ( nextgen or dusty ) for a given mass .",
    "for all the objects we used the absolute magnitudes in the j and f110 m filters ( we averaged the two of them if both magnitudes were available ) and the nextgen models , but for roque  25 we used the k - band absolute magnitude and the dusty model .",

    "steele & jameson ( 1995 ) have suggested that 46% of pleiades vlm stars are multiple on the basis of a spectroscopic study of temperature indicators . however , none of their hhj candidate binaries observed with hst / wfpc were resolved .",
    "bouvier , rigaut & nadeau ( 1997 ) carried out an ao search for binaries among 144 g- and k - type pleiades members .",
    "they found that the binary frequency and period distribution of their sample is similar to that of dm91 .",
    "since the dm91 study has better statistics , we have used their orbital period and mass ratio distributions for predicting the number of binaries expected in our sample .",
    "the results are given in the third column of table  7 .",
    "we have converted the observed upper limits on components separations on the plane of the sky ( s ) to semi - major axes ( a ) using a cluster distance of 125  pc and s / a=0.92 ( heacox & gathright 1994 ) .",
    "considering our sample of pleiades bds observed with hst / nicmos , we find that there is a factor of @xmath23 excess of binaries with respect to the distribution of dm91 for separations smaller than 10.9  au , which corresponds to orbital periods shorter than @xmath2110 years .",
    "however , because of the small size of our sample we find that the difference between the pleiades and the field binaries is significant only at the 1  @xmath12 level . on the other hand , it is more significant that we do not find any binaries with separations larger than @xmath227  au .",
    "the lack of pleiades vlm systems with periods longer than 444 years ( 3.4 expected , 0 found ) is a 2  @xmath12 effect for poisson statistics .",
    "reid & gizis ( 1997 ) obtained hst observations of 53 hyades m - type members ( primary mass @xmath00.3  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "they found nine binaries with q@xmath40.5 in the separation range 14 to 825  au , consistent with observations of m - dwarfs in the solar neighborhood .",
    "if the binary properties of our pleiades vlm sample was similar to that of the hyades sample of reid & gizis , we should have found 2 binaries with separations larger than 30  au .",
    "when they grow old , the pleiades vlm stars and bds will become cooler and will look similar to l - type field dwarfs . the first three field binaries with l - dwarf components have been recently discovered ( martn , brandner & basri 1999 ; koerner et al .",
    "all of them have separations less than 10 au , and would not have been resolved in our survey if they were at the pleiades distance .",
    "there is no bias against finding wider binaries because the fov in these searches is @xmath26100  au .",
    "in fact , no wide doubles have been reported in the infrared images of @xmath2 100 l dwarfs and @xmath215 methane dwarfs identified so far in the denis , sloan and 2mass surveys .",
    "however , there has not been a survey for spectroscopic binaries among ultracool dwarfs .",
    "there could be many short - period vlm binaries that have not been identified yet .",
    "the null result of our survey for pleiades bd binaries is consistent with the properties of the field bd binaries found so far .",
    "the median orbital separation of the main - sequence stars studied by dm91 is 23  au ( heacox 1998 ) .",
    "two pleiades bd binaries ( ppl  15 and cfht  pl  16 ) and three field bd binaries have been identified with separations @xmath323  au , but no bd binaries are known to have separations @xmath2623  au . the systematically small separations of the bd binaries with respect to the dm91 sample , suggest that there is a difference in population characteristics .",
    "the small numbers involved preclude any definitive conclusion in this regard , but it is worth of mention and brief discussion .",
    "the mass of the primary could be an important factor in the the process of binary formation .",
    "basri & martn ( 1999 ) suggested that the formation of substellar binaries is biased toward smaller separations than the formation of stellar binaries because the probability of finding a short - period binary like ppl  15 from a normal ( dm91-type ) binary distribution is only @xmath210% .",
    "another interesting proposition is that of a `` brown dwarf desert '' , i.e. a scarcity of bd secondaries to g and k dwarfs within 2 au of the primary ( marcy & butler 1998 ) .",
    "it seems that bds , as objects representative of the tail of the stellar mass function , could provide important hints about binary formation .",
    "we briefly consider three possible scenarios that could explain a difference in the characteristics of bd binaries with respect to the dm91 sample : ( 1 ) disruption of wide binaries due to dynamical interactions with the stellar members of the cluster .",
    "this process has been invoked by kroupa , petr & mccaughrean ( 1999 ) to explain the binary frequency of stars in the trapezium cluster . an important test of this scenario",
    "is the binary frequency of hard binaries , which should be independent of primary mass .",
    "( 2 ) if vlm stars and bds usually come from the dynamical ejection of vlm fragments from protostellar aggregates ( laughlin & lin , private communication ) , the ones that are more likely to survive are close binaries with nearly - identical component .",
    "such an scenario has two constraints to overcome .",
    "the typical ejection velocity of the ejected vlm star or bd can not be much larger than the escape velocity from the pleiades cluster .",
    "the mechanism has to be extremely efficient because bds are quite numerous .",
    "( 3 ) numerical simulations of molecular cloud fragmentation have shown that slower rotating cloud cores form closer binaries than when the clouds are rapidly rotating ( boss 1993 ) .",
    "small cloud cores that start collapse from high initial densities form even closer binaries .",
    "this scenario seems provide a natural way of explaining the absence of wide bd binaries and an excess of close systems .",
    "furthermore , the bd desert around solar - type stars can also be explained by fragmentation processes ( bate 2000 ) .",
    "we have presented nir photometry and low - resolution spectroscopy for all the bd candidates reported by b98 .",
    "we have also applied the lithium test to cfht - pl-16 and 18 .",
    "the membership status of all the cfht bd candidates is summarized in table  6 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the cfht sample for addressing the issue of the substellar mass function , because the level of follow - up observations of the bd candidates coming from other surveys is still incomplete .    the level of field star contamination among pleiades bd candidates was assessed by b98 using two statistical approaches .",
    "they compared the mass of pleiades members and field stars in the same volume , and they used a field luminosity function .",
    "both methods were in good agreement , and suggested a contamination of 25% .",
    "we confirm the membership of 12 pleiades cfht bd candidates out of the 18 included in b98 .",
    "the 6 non - members are all foreground cool m dwarfs .",
    "we find a contamination of 33% , which is somewhat higher than the estimate of b98 .",
    "these authors obtained a power - law index in a log - log plot ( dn / dm@xmath2m@xmath27 ) of @xmath13=-0.6 for the cluster imf across the substellar boundary .",
    "we revise this slope downwards to a value of @xmath13=-0.53 , implying that the number of bds per decreasing mass bin is moderately rising , but their relative contribution to the total mass of the pleiades cluster is diminishing .",
    "we can not make a detailed correction of the imf for the binary fraction of the cfht bds because we have not resolved any system .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the binary corrections are probably not very important because there does not seem to be many bd companions to stars , and because our search for binaries suggest that bds do not have a higher multiplicity frequency than m - type stars .",
