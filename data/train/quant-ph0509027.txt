    "entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information processing  @xcite and the violation of bell s inequalities  @xcite can be a basic tool test to detect entanglement  @xcite and discard the possibility of simulating the experimental data by means of classically correlated systems .",
    "so far , the most reliable source of both two - party and multiparty entanglement are polarization - entangled photons created by parametric down - conversion ( pdc )  @xcite .",
    "although there are other types of photon entanglement ( momentum entanglement  @xcite , position and time entanglement  @xcite , time - bin entanglement  @xcite , orbital angular momentum entanglement  @xcite ) , and even entanglement between ions  @xcite , or between atomic beams  @xcite , polarization entanglement remains the most widely implemented due to its robustness and ease of use .",
    "when violations of bell s inequalities for realistic states are analyzed and , specifically , when resistance to noise is studied , it is usually assumed that such a noise is white or uncolored  @xcite . in the presence of white noise",
    "a quantum pure state @xmath0 becomes @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the probability that the state is unaffected by noise , @xmath3 is the dimension of the hilbert space of the whole system , and @xmath4 is the identity matrix in that hilbert space .",
    "however , when working with real systems the noise is very rarely colorless . for entangled photon production via pdc",
    "it is experimentally found that while correlations are very strong in the `` natural '' basis of the crystal ( i.e. , the basis in which the phase matching conditions are expressed ) , the same is not true for maximally conjugated basis .",
    "for this reason it is common to use the visibility obtained by fixing one polarizer at @xmath5 and rotating the other as a shorthand for entanglement quality .",
    "the physical reason for the difference in the two visibilities lies in the phase matching . for type - ii pdc",
    "every down - converted pair will consist of one ordinary and one extraordinary photon ( generally labeled as @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , but by itself the phase matching does not guarantee correlations in any other basis . to achieve an entangled state , it is necessary to make the two down - conversion possibilities , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , indistinguishable and obtain a fixed phase between them .",
    "this indistinguishability is achieved by careful mode selection and enhanced by the use of narrow band filters and so - called compensator crystals  @xcite but it is inevitably imperfect . since in an experiment we typically only measure the polarization , the other degrees of freedom are traced over and the noise appears as a decoherence - type term @xmath10    in this paper , we study the robustness of maximal violations of several bell s inequalities against two kinds of noise : white noise and the colored noise mentioned above .",
    "the experimental scenarios studied correspond to experiments already performed in the laboratory , and therefore the conclusions can be checked using current technology . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we study the influence of noise on the maximal violation of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality  @xcite by two - qubit entangled states , assuming that these states are maximally entangled states affected by either of these types of noise . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we study the dependence of the maximal violation of the mermin - klyshko inequalities  @xcite by three - qubit and four - qubit entangled states , assuming that these states are greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states  @xcite affected by white or colored noise . in sec .  [ sec:4 ] we study the influence of noise on the maximal violation of a chsh - like inequality by two - qutrits entangled states simulated by four - qubit entangled states , assuming that these states are maximally entangled two - qutrit states simulated by rotationally invariant four - qubit singlet states  @xcite affected by white or colored noise .",
    "finally , the conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] .",
    "for two qubits , singlet states , @xmath11 affected by white noise , @xmath12 are called werner states  @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed that werner states suitably describe the states employed in two - qubit tests of the bell s inequality using polarization - entangled photons prepared using pdc  @xcite .    experimental evidence and",
    "physical arguments show that a colorless noise model is not the best choice for describing states produced in type - ii pdc .",
    "a more realistic description is given by an alternative one parameter model where the singlet is mixed with decoherence terms in a preferred polarization basis @xmath13    the chsh inequality  @xcite is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is called the bell operator .    to study maximal violations of the chsh inequality  ( [ chsh ] ) for states with white noise @xmath16 , given by eq .",

    "the first interesting point is that the @xmath17 states violate the chsh inequality _ for any @xmath2_. that is , the violation is very robust against the colored noise . on the other hand ,",

    "consider the three - qubit version of mermin s inequality  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 it is usually assumed that ghz states with white noise suitably describe the states employed in three - qubit tests of the bell inequality using polarization - entangled photons  @xcite .",
    "these states can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 however , a more realistic descriptions of the states obtained in the laboratory is @xmath36    to calculate the maximum value of @xmath37 for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 states we will confine our attention to the following local observables : @xmath38    then , _ both _ for states with white ( [ ghzwhite ] ) and colored noise ( [ ghzlamas ] ) , we obtain that @xmath39 for any @xmath2 , these maximum values can be obtained by choosing @xmath40 in eqs .",
    "( [ aj ] ) and ( [ bj ] ) .",
    "therefore , in this case , the more realistic noise does not give a different violation than those with white noise .",
    "the conclusion is similar for four - photon ghz states and mermin - klyshko inequality  @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42    both for the states with white noise @xmath43 and for the states with colored noise @xmath44 where @xmath45 and choosing the same six local observables for the first three qubits given by eqs .",
    "( [ aj ] ) and ( [ bj ] ) , plus the following local observables on the fourth qubit : @xmath46 we find that @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , @xmath49 will attain a maximum for a given @xmath2 at fixed angles , which turn out to be eqs .",
    "( [ theta3 ] ) and ( [ phi3 ] ) .",
    "since inequalities ( [ m3 ] ) and ( [ k4 ] ) are tools to detect and measure genuine @xmath50-particle nonseparability  @xcite , we conclude that there is no difference between the white and colored noise s entanglement for an experiment with the proposed observables with three  @xcite or four  @xcite polarization - entangled ghz states .",
    "the two - qutrit singlet state ( i.e. , the two spin-1 particles singlet state ) , @xmath51 can be simulated by a four - qubit state by defining @xmath52 ) , we obtain @xmath53 which is the four - qubit rotationally invariant state which can be prepared in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "we will consider two types of noise : white noise and colored noise .",
    "the four - qubit rotationally invariant state with white noise is @xmath54 where @xmath4 is the identity matrix .",
    "the four - qubit rotationally invariant state with colored noise is @xmath55    we want to study how the maximum possible violation of a chsh - like inequality for the two - qutrit singlet state simulated by a four - qubit rotationally invariant state depends on noise . simulating state ( [ psi3 ] ) by means of state ( [ psi4 ] )",
    "imposes some restrictions over the possible local observables .",
    "the first is that we must consider only those which can be implemented by the product of two one - photon observables , since general two - photon observables are difficult to implement .",
    "the second is that some procedures for preparing state ( [ psi4 ] ) do not allow us to distinguish between photon-1 and photon-2 ( and between photon-3 and photon-4 ) ; therefore , this will lead us to consider only local measurements that can be implemented as a product of the _ same _ two one - photon polarization observables .",

    "the maximum value of @xmath23 is always obtained by choosing @xmath65    however , for states with colored noise ( [ psi4colored ] ) , the maximum value of @xmath23 depends on @xmath2 in a more complicated fashion .",

    "a remarkable property is that for @xmath66 , and choosing @xmath67 , we obtain @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , violations of inequality ( [ chsh4 ] ) occur _ for any @xmath69_. that is , the violation is extremely robust against noise .",
    "polarization - entangled photons created by pdc are , so far , the most reliable and widespread systems to prepare the most common types of entanglement : two - qubit entanglement , multiqubit entanglement , and two - qudit entanglement . testing the violation of bell s inequalities is a basic tool for detecting entanglement and , therefore , for confirming the genuine quantum behavior of a physical system .",
    "real observed data are affected by noise and most theoretical studies of violations of bell s inequalities assume that this noise is white .",
    "however , pdc sources have their own characteristic noise .",
    "in this paper we have investigated to what extent this specific noise modifies previous conclusions about the influence of noise in bell s inequalities based on the assumption that the noise is completely unbiased .",
    "the most important conclusion is that , in the case of bipartite systems of qubits or qutrits ( each of them simulated by a pair of qubits ) , the violation of the chsh inequality is extremely robust , meaning that even sources with an extremely low purity @xmath2 violate the chsh inequality with a suitable choice of local observables .",
    "we have calculated which local observables provide the maximum violation as a function of @xmath2 for both cases .",
    "not surprisingly we find that the case of white noise , the maximal violation always occurs for the same choice of local observables and no violation occurs under a certain value of @xmath2 , while in the more realistic case the optimal observables are a function of @xmath2 .",
    "our predictions for both types of noise and different values of @xmath2 can be experimentally tested in the laboratory with current technology , since there are sources of high purity ( @xmath70 ) , and it is possible to generate additional noise of both types with relative ease  @xcite .",
    "we have also studied the influence of realistic noise for three and four - qubit systems and mermin - klyshko inequalities and we have found that , in that instance , the possible maximal violations are similar to those obtained assuming white noise .",
