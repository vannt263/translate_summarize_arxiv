    "culture is the sum of knowledge , beliefs , values and behavioral patterns built up by a group of human beings and transmitted from one generation to the next . cultural evolution for _",
    "homo sapiens _ started early in the prehistoric age , and as archeological evidence suggests it has gone through a number of short episodes during which its prevalence and overall influence on everyday life increased abruptly .",
    "the most important of these events occurred approximately 50,000 years ago , giving birth to art , music , religion and warfare .",
    "this episode is usually termed the  cultural explosion \" @xcite .",
    "the evolution of human culture is investigated in many disciplines using different paradigms .",
    "economics uses game theory to understand the development of rules , social norms and other cultural institutions assuming rational behavior of the constituting individuals ( agents ) @xcite .",
    "cognitive and behavioral sciences study how culture is represented in the mind @xcite , and how these  mental representations \" change under social interactions @xcite . physics views culture and its evolution as a complex , dynamic system , and aims to identify its basic universal properties using simple minimal models @xcite .",
    "the emergence of culture seems to involve a chicken - and - egg problem : culture becomes what the constituting agents make it to be , and agents , based on their capacity of learning , constantly adapt to the culture they happen to live in .",
    "in this sense culture is the dynamic attractor of the complex social dynamics , determined by the agents actual constraints and social interactions . the aim of this paper is to investigate the properties of such cultural attractors in an adequately formulated social dynamics model , which integrates the relevant concepts from the social sciences with those from the physics perspective .",
    "one of the popular minimal models of cultural evolution is that of axelrod @xcite .",
    "axelrod s model investigates an initially random population of biologically and economically uniform agents .",
    "social interaction is limited to an imitation process in which agents adapt cultural traits stochastically from each other with a bias toward already similar agents .",
    "the interesting question is under what circumstances global cultural diversity gets preserved despite the homogenizing interaction @xcite .",
    "however , the question can also be posed from the opposite direction : in a population with non - negligible heterogeneity and under social interactions which are not necessarily imitational but rather reflect selfish individual interests how can a _",
    "coherent _ culture emerge ?    in order to study this question , our model differs from that of axelrod in two ways .",
    "first , we explicitly consider individual decision making mechanisms and identify  dimension reduction \" as a fundamental heuristic for cognitively limited but otherwise rational agents .",
    "this is one of the possible implementations of the concept of _ bounded rationality _ well - known in economics and social sciences @xcite .",
    "specifically , agents are constrained to describe and understand their world along a finite number of  concepts \" ( concepts ) .",
    "the totality of these concepts constitutes the agent s cultural profile .",
    "the concepts establish an interface to the objective world : agents use them to build an adequate mental representation of natural and social reality for evaluating decision alternatives . obviously , decision making is successful if evaluation is precise , thus rational agents face the problem of optimizing their concepts given the actual state of the world",
    ". innate or acquired heterogeneity in individual preferences , however , can give rise to substantial deviations in these optimal concepts across members of the population . people with such differences in cultural profile end up having unequal views of the world , they evaluate alternatives differently , and make different choices accordingly .",
    "second , instead of a simple imitation process our agents are assumed to interact in a competitive game @xcite .",
    "we think of the concepts as flexible mental constructs which are continuously updated and refined according to a  best response dynamics \" in order to maximize the agents predictive power in the actual natural and social environment . as such",
    ", our model treats the evolution of cultural profiles ( the set of concepts ) as the result of rational behavior governed by economic benefit .",
    "the concepts are continuous variables and agents are assumed heterogeneous in their fixed preferences by default .",
    "conceptually , our theory will be a renormalization group theory as it is based on the following two key elements : ( i ) it combines the original state variables ( attributes of decision alternatives ) into important and less important degrees of freedom ; agents keep the former ( defined to be the concepts ) , and discard the latter ; ( ii ) this is done in an iterative way taking into account the other agents profiles and aiming to identify a fixed point ( associated with culture ) .",
    "the criterion for truncating the degrees of freedom is local : each agent tries to maximize its evaluation accuracy , i.e. , to minimize the representation / evaluation error within its cognitive limits .",
    "in order to define a simple , tractable model , we will introduce two simplifying assumptions : we will assume that the objective world in which the agents live is _ linear _ , and that the subjective heuristics that they use to predict their environment is also _ linear _ , in a sense to be made precise below . clearly , these are important simplifications as both the real world and the real mental models are likely to exhibit substantial non - linearities . for a first analysis , however , this approximation is sufficient .",
    "we consider @xmath0 agents , each restricted to use a number @xmath1 of concepts only .",
    "agents divide the world into a number @xmath2 of _ contexts _ in which they evaluate decision alternatives according to their personal preferences .",
    "we assume that alternatives are characterized by their objective ( physical ) attributes @xmath3 .",
    "agent @xmath4 s _ theoretical payoff _ from choosing alternative @xmath5 in context @xmath6 is posited to be a linear function (  linear world assumption \" ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the agent s _ preference vector _ , characterizing the agent s personal ( biological or otherwise acquired ) fixed preference in context @xmath6 . for each agent",
    "there are @xmath2 preference vectors each of dimension @xmath9 , which are assumed fixed in the model .",
    "an agent does not know his preference vectors explicitly as this would require a detailed understanding of the effect of all attributes on his payoffs .",
    "however , by collecting experience on choices he has made previously , he learns to approximate the payoffs using an appropriate _ mental representation_. the mental representation is built around the world s @xmath1  most important degrees of freedom \" , constituting the agent s concepts . we assume again that the _ approximate payoff _ that the agent  computes \" directly is linear (  linear representation assumption \" ) @xmath10 with @xmath11 the agent s _ approximate preference vector _ ( that the agent knows explicitly ) .",
    "@xmath12 is decomposed using _ mental weights _ @xmath13 in a reduced subspace of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "the weight @xmath13 reflects the significance of concept @xmath14 in context @xmath6 .",
    "equation ( [ approxutil ] ) implies that agent @xmath4 possesses a number @xmath1 of concept vectors , @xmath15 , assumed normalized @xmath16 , which the agent uses to evaluate alternatives .",
    "we emphasize that the concepts are defined in a context - independent way , i.e , they have the same  meaning \" in all occurring contexts .",
    "the structure of our model is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3layer ] .",
    "we have defined three layers : the layer of  physical attributes \" of the decision alternatives , the layer of concepts ( defined by concept vectors ) which constitute the renormalized degrees of freedom , and the layer of context- and agent - specific  payoffs \" . at the lowest level agents are homogeneous and have identical information about alternatives . in the highest layer agents are heterogeneous and have individual payoff functions based on their individual preferences .",
    "the middle layer shows partial coherence , whose measure , as we will see , is determined by the strength of social interactions .",
    "this is the layer we intend to monitor across society for observing the emergence and evolution of a common culture .",
    "an example may be enlightening at this point .",
    "think about the world of chess where decision alternatives are the possible moves a player can choose in a given situation .",
    "these moves are characterized by the position of the pieces on the board ( physical attributes ) .",
    "calculating the payoff of a move ( the probability of winning the game with that move ) is basically a two step procedure for human players and chess programs alike .",
    "first the move is evaluated along some general concepts like  material advantage \" ,  positional advantage \" ,  pinned piece \" , etc . indeed , research in psychology",
    "has demonstrated that a human grand master possesses tens of thousands of such chess - related concepts @xcite .",
    "second , these concept scores are weighted ( mental weights ) in an appropriate mental model .",
    "the weighting scheme depends on the player s personal skills / style ( agent heterogeneity ) and on the actual adversary ( context dependence ) .",
    "there is a theoretically best move ( preference vector ) for that player with that adversary in that situation , but that is not known explicitly to the player . mastering chess amounts to finding an optimal mental representation , i.e. , optimal concepts and optimal weights ( approximate preference vectors ) which allow a decision close to the theoretical best . in chess",
    "there are different",
    " schools \" ( cultures ) where the applied concepts have somewhat different meaning .",
    "of course , decision in chess is very non - linear , and our simplified linear model can only grasp the big picture .",
    "the hierarchical structure depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3layer ] formally resembles a linear two - layer ( concept vectors , mental weights ) neural network .",
    "note , however , that it is not a microscopic neural network model of a cognitive function , but a phenomenological ( macroscopic ) model of a generic decision making strategy .    under this cognitive architecture",
    "the number of variables defining an agent is @xmath17 , much less than the total number of parameters describing the world , @xmath18 .",
    "however , there is a price that should be paid for bounded rationality : due to the reduction of dimensionality , @xmath19 , the approximate payoff @xmath20 deviates from the theoretical payoff @xmath21 .",
    "the agents goal is to find the best possible set of concepts and mental weights which minimize the error of the mental representation under the constraint that only @xmath1 concepts can be used .",
    "the natural measure of agent @xmath4 s _ representation error _ is the variance@xmath22 where @xmath23 is the average over alternatives in context @xmath6 .",
    "we restrict our attention to the case , where the attributes are delta correlated @xmath24 and nontrivial structure is assumed in the agent - specific preference vectors only .",
    "this simplifies the forthcoming analysis without losing essential features . with this proviso ,",
    "the representation error turns out to be @xmath25 the agents goal is to minimize the error @xmath26 by optimally choosing their concept vectors @xmath27 and mental weights @xmath28 .",
    "recall that @xmath29 is assumed fixed in the model .",
    "theoretically the minimizing parameters can be easily determined . differentiating w.r.t .",
    "@xmath13 and assuming that the @xmath30 metric tensor @xmath31 is invertible ( note that the concepts are not necessarily orthogonal ) , the optimal mental weights read @xmath32 where we have introduced the  dual \" concept vectors @xmath33_{\\mu\\nu } { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$\\gamma$}}}_{i\\nu}$ ] . writing this back to eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) we can write the error as @xmath34 in this way the representation error is written as a function of the @xmath35 concept vectors only . conceptually this is equivalent to the reasonable assumption that the mental weights accommodate much faster than the concepts themselves .    neglecting the first term , which is an unimportant constant , we define the agent s utility as the negative of his overall representation error @xmath36 which should now be maximized for @xmath37 .",
    "the utility can be written in a more compact form @xmath38 by introducing a positive semi - definite , @xmath39 dimensional matrix , to be called the _ world matrix _ ,",
    "@xmath40 which encompasses all information about agent @xmath4 s ( objective ) personal relationship to the world .",
    "the maximization problem in eq .",
    "( [ utility ] ) is the well - known principal component analysis ( pca ) problem . according to this , a particular solution for the optimal concept vectors",
    "is provided by the @xmath1 most significant ( largest eigenvalue ) eigenvectors of @xmath41 .",
    "thus to achieve the best possible mental representation the agent should choose his concept vectors according to the eigenvectors of his world matrix in the order of their significance , and then adapt his mental weights according to eq .",
    "( [ mentalweights ] ) .",
    "notice , however , that this solution is not unique : any non - singular basis transformation in the subspace of the @xmath1 most significant eigenvectors yields a different solution with identical utility .",
    "we can freely define linear transformations in the subspace of concepts ; the mental weights adapt , and the overall representation error remains unchanged .",
    "it is obvious that if @xmath41 is a non - singular , rank-@xmath9 matrix , then for @xmath19 the error is strictly positive even with an optimally chosen set of concepts .",
    "the identification , sorting and truncation of the degrees of freedom in our model is closely analogous to what occurs in white s density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg ) @xcite  a numerical technique widely used in the simulation of strongly correlated quantum systems . in the dmrg",
    "the optimally renormalized degrees of freedom turn out to be the @xmath1 most significant eigenvectors of the reduced density matrix of the quantum subsystem embedded in the environment with which it interacts .",
    "a formal mapping between the dmrg and our method can be established by identifying the dmrg s density matrix for block @xmath4 with the world matrix @xmath41 for agent @xmath4 ( both measuring the subsystem s relationship to the environment ) , and the renormalized ( kept ) quantum mechanical degrees of freedom with the concepts . the dmrg s  truncation error \" is analogous to our representation error .",
    "there , the error measures how precisely the entangled quantum mechanical wave function ( written in a matrix form ) is reconstructed after the truncation of the degrees of freedom ; here , the role of the wave function is played by the @xmath42 dimensional matrix formed by the preference vectors @xmath8 .",
    "the two problems are conceptually similar in that both seek an optimal linear reduction of dimensionality for the subsystem , which is mathematically equivalent to the pca problem .",
    "as shown above , the representation error is minimal if the agent learns to approximate his world matrix in the @xmath1 dimensional subspace spanned by the most significant eigenvectors of his world matrix .",
    "if agents @xmath4 and @xmath43 have different preferences , and thus different world matrices , they would necessarily end up with different optimal concepts .",
    "cultural evolution boils down to the interaction of these different concepts in a social network . in order to introduce social interactions we cast contexts into two basic categories : those where preference vectors only depend on a single agent (  individual contexts \" ) , and those where the preference vectors for agent @xmath4 depend on the ( simultaneous ) decision / preference of at least another agent @xmath43 (  social contexts \" ) . for simplicity",
    "only pair interactions will be considered . in social contexts",
    "the understanding of another agent s valuation and decision making mechanism is an asset .",

    "we can view the society as a dynamical system in which agents continuously act as best - response optimizers @xcite , in each step maximizing their utility given the actual state of nature and other agents ( _ best - response dynamics _ ) .",
    "alternatively , and this is more consistent with bounded rationality , we can postulate a slow , continuous adjustment dynamics which drives agents towards ever better responses . in this spirit",

    "we have analyzed the social behavior under two : the best response dynamics and the continuous gradient adjustment dynamics defined in eq .",
    "( [ adjust ] ) . in the best response dynamics we started from a certain initial condition of individual concepts . in each step",
    ", we first calculated the actual cop , then updated ( with a certain probability to make the update asynchronous ) each agent s concepts according to the @xmath1 largest principal components of @xmath41 .",

    "in the gradient adjustment method we discretized the differential equation in eq .",
    "( [ adjust ] ) .",
    "fixed points of the best response dynamics are nash equilibria , where agents have no incentive to unilaterally deform their mental representations , because these are already mutually optimal . fixed points attained dynamically by gradient adjustment , in turn , are necessarily stable against small collective perturbations in the concept vectors , i.e. , when several agents consider slight deviations simultaneously , but not necessarily optimal on a global scale .",
    "it is a special feature of our model ( which is usually not the case in other models ) that these two dynamics have identical fixed points , i.e. , the attained fixed point of the gradient dynamics is also a nash equilibrium , and vice versa .",
    "this feature stems from the fact that the landscape of the pca s quadratic error function is known to be smooth with a unique minimizing subspace @xcite .",

    "in summary , in this paper we have proposed a theory of cultural evolution built upon a renormalization group scheme .",
    "we assumed that bounded rationality forces agents to choose a limited set of concepts in describing their world .",
    "these concepts and the way they are used are continuously updated and refined in order to find an optimal representation .",
    "individual interest in making the best possible decisions in natural ( individual ) and social ( collective ) contexts act as a driving force for cultural evolution and , at least in the particular cases studied , drive the system towards a nash equilibrium fixed point with measurable level of social ( cultural ) coherence . in our model with random preferences this coherence manifested itself as a spontaneous ordering of the individual concept ( sub)spaces , and was quantified by an adequate order parameter .",
    "we demonstrated that as the fundamental cognitive and social parameters change , cultural evolution goes through a number of phase transitions , which we found first order in the mean - field model .",
    "the critical value of the most relevant transition was calculated analytically using linear stability arguments and random matrix theory .",
    "transition to a phase with substantially higher cultural coherence can be triggered in two different ways ( see the arrows in fig .  [",
    "fig : phdiag ] ) : social contexts can increase in significance , or alternatively , agents may develop better cognitive skills . in any case when one of the transition lines is crossed , the subspaces spanned by the agents concepts rearrange into a state with higher average overlap , and we can speak about a boost in cultural coherence . a similar transition may explain the sudden cultural explosions for humanity approximately 50,000 years ago , and a further jump about 10,000 years ago in connection with the emergence of agriculture . since in our model the ordering involves a spontaneous symmetry breaking , the emerging fixed point strongly depends on the initial perturbation ( a phenomenon usually termed",
    " path dependence \" in the social sciences ) , implying that cultural evolution is not completely deterministic but depends on a number of idiosyncratic factors .",
    "our theory differs conceptually from some traditional thinking on the possible causes underlying human cultural explosion .",
    "most of these traditional explanations presume a sudden and substantial _ biological _ change ( genetic mutations @xcite , the integration of cognitive modules in the brain @xcite , etc . ) as the initial trigger .",
    "in contrast with these , the mechanism we have proposed in this paper suggests a _ spontaneous ordering _ of the mental representations , which emerges when _ slow changes _ in some relevant variables ( cognitive abilities , social interactions ) reach a critical level . in this respect",
    "the  cultureless state \" of the society , originally rooted in the heterogeneity of its members in individual preferences , needs , experiences and the extreme simplicity of the mental representations they possess , becomes unstable at a bifurcation point , beyond which the collective social dynamics drives the system into a drastically different , culturally ordered fixed point .",
    "it would be interesting to go beyond mean field , and investigate the model s dynamics in more realistic social networks , where the fixed point may possess a more complex internal structure . a non - mean - field - like social structure",
    "is expected to give rise to subcultures or cultural domains , where individuals are highly coherent within a domain , but the average cultural subspace the domain represents may be rather different from that of another domain , as occurs usually in real societies .",
