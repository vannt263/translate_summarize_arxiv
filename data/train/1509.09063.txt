    "in a series of papers from the early eighties , kasparov proved the fundamental results on the @xmath0-theory of @xmath1-algebras , @xcite .",
    "one of the main inventions appearing in these papers is the interior kasparov product which provides a bilinear and associative pairing @xmath2 between the @xmath0-groups of three ( separable ) @xmath1-algebras @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the interior kasparov product of two @xmath0-classes is computable in many cases , but the main construction remains inexplicit as it relies on kasparov s absorption theorem and kasparov s technical theorem .",
    "one of the advantages of the @xmath0-groups of @xmath1-algebras is the wealth of explicit examples of elements arising from geometric data .",
    "indeed , in the unbounded picture of @xmath0-theory the cycles are unbounded kasparov modules , which are bivariant versions of connes concept of a spectral triple , and the unbounded kasparov modules exhaust the @xmath0-groups as was proved by baaj and julg , @xcite .",
    "the problem that we are concerned with in this paper is to construct an unbounded version of the interior kasparov product .",
    "more precisely , starting with two unbounded kasparov modules , the aim is to find an _ explicit",
    "_ unbounded kasparov module that represents the interior kasparov product .",
    "in particular , this construction should bypass the need for invoking both the absorption theorem and the technical theorem .",
    "the problem of constructing the unbounded kasparov product is currently receiving an increasing amount of attention , see @xcite , as is also witnessed by the quantity of recent applications , see @xcite .    at a deeper level ,",
    "the unbounded kasparov product is important because of the loss of geometric information that is inherent in the passage from an unbounded kasparov module to a class in @xmath0-theory .",
    "it is thus in our interest to be able to perform a version of the interior kasparov product while retaining a larger amount of geometric data ( as for example the asymptotic behaviour of eigenvalues of differential operators ) .    in this paper",
    "we are focusing on the case where the class in the @xmath0-group , @xmath5 , is represented by a @xmath1-correspondence @xmath6 from @xmath7 to @xmath8 and where the action of @xmath7 from the left factorizes through the @xmath1-algebra of compact operators on @xmath6 . on the other hand",
    ", our class in the @xmath0-group @xmath9 will be represented by an unbounded selfadjoint operator @xmath10 acting on a @xmath1-correspondence from @xmath8 to @xmath4 .",
    "the unbounded operator @xmath11 is required to satisfy a couple of extra conditions that will be detailed out in the main text .",
    "the first challenge is then to construct a new unbounded selfadjoint operator @xmath12 that acts on the interior tensor product of the @xmath1-correspondences @xmath6 and @xmath13 . in the main part of the earlier works on the unbounded kasparov product",
    "this step is accomplished by assuming the existence of a ( tight normalized ) frame @xmath14 for @xmath6 ( see @xcite ) such that the associated orthogonal projection @xmath15 ( which acts on the standard module over @xmath13 ) has a bounded commutator with the unbounded selfadjoint operator @xmath10 ( slightly weaker conditions are applied in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the unbounded selfadjoint operator @xmath16 can then be expressed as the infinite sum @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , is the creation operator associated with the element @xmath20 .",
    "it should be noted that the unbounded selfadjoint operator @xmath21 can be described in an alternative way by using the notion of a densely defined covariant derivative @xmath22 on the @xmath1-correspondence @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , the frame @xmath14 gives rise to a grassmann covariant derivative @xmath23 and the unbounded selfadjoint operator @xmath21 is then given by the ( closure of the ) sum @xmath24 where the `` @xmath25 '' refers to an appropriate notion of clifford multiplication .",
    "one of the main contributions of this paper is that we have been able to _ entirely remove _ the above smooth projectivity condition on the @xmath1-correspondence @xmath6 .",
    "this radical step is motivated by the detailed investigations of differentiable structures in hilbert @xmath1-modules carried out in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we find that the removal of smooth projectivity is necessary for accommodating examples arising from non - complete manifolds .    instead of smooth projectivity",
    "we will simply assume that there exists a sequence of generators @xmath26 for @xmath6 such that the associated operator @xmath27 has a bounded commutator with ( the diagonal operator induced by ) @xmath10 .",
    "we then obtain a new unbounded selfadjoint operator @xmath28 on the interior tensor product @xmath29 .",
    "we refer to this unbounded selfadjoint operator as the _ modular lift _ of @xmath10 .",
    "the fact that our sequence @xmath26 is no longer a frame means that we obtain an extra ( non - trivial ) bounded adjointable operator @xmath30 on the interior tensor product .",
    "an investigation of the commutators between the algebra elements in @xmath7 and the modular lift now shows that the usual straight commutator has to be replaced by a twisted commutator where the twist is given by the ( modular ) automorphism @xmath31 obtained from conjugation with the modular operator @xmath32 .",
    "this modular automorphism corresponds to the analytic extension at @xmath33 of the modular group of automorphisms @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "we remark however that , in spite of the definitions in @xcite , we do not require that the modular automorphism @xmath31 is densely defined on the algebra @xmath7 .",
    "our first main result can now be stated as follows ( where we refer to the main text for the precise definitions ) :    [ t : unbkasint ] suppose that @xmath6 is a differentiable @xmath1-correspondence with left action factorizing through the compacts and that @xmath36 is an unbounded modular cycle ( with modular operator @xmath37 ) .",
    "then the triple @xmath38 is an unbounded modular cycle where the new modular operator is defined by @xmath39 .",
    "the second central theme of this paper develops around the relationship between the assignment @xmath40 and the interior kasparov product @xmath41 . in this respect",
    "it is first necessary to understand how to produce a class in @xmath0-theory from an unbounded modular cycle .",
    "we announce the following theorem :    [ t : bddkasint ] suppose that @xmath36 is an unbounded modular cycle ( between the @xmath1-algebras @xmath8 and @xmath4 )",
    ". then the pair @xmath42 is a bounded kasparov module from @xmath8 to @xmath4 and we thus have a class @xmath43 \\in kk_m(b , c)$ ] .    of course , this theorem is a direct analogue of the theorem of baaj and julg that shows how to construct a class in @xmath0-theory from an unbounded kasparov module .",
    "the proof of this result in the context of unbounded modular cycle is however far more involved .",
    "the reason for this extra difficulty can be found in the seemingly innocent change from straight commutators to twisted commutators .",
    "indeed , an examination of the proof appearing in @xcite shows that the crucial step fails for algebraic reasons when applied to unbounded modular cycles .",
    "an alternative approach would be to follow connes and moscovici s method and replace @xmath44 by @xmath45 , see @xcite .",
    "this alternative approach does however rely on an extra assumption of twisted lipschitz regularity and we do not impose this kind of extra regularity conditions on our unbounded modular cycle . indeed , it is unclear how twisted lipschitz regularity behaves with respect to the unbounded kasparov product given in theorem [ t : unbkasint ] .",
    "we have therefore found it necessary to develop a novel method of proof that can be applied to non - lipschitz unbounded modular cycles .",
    "the main new tool appearing in the proof of theorem [ t : bddkasint ] is the _ modular transform _",
    "@xmath46 which is given by the ( absolutely convergent ) integral @xmath47 for all @xmath48 .",
    "the modular transform is obtained from the bounded transform by making a non - commutative change of variables corresponding to @xmath49 .",
    "this change of variables is motivated by the observation that the modular transform ( contrary to the bounded transform ) has the right commutator properties with elements in the algebra @xmath7 . a substantial part of the proof of theorem [ t : bddkasint ]",
    "is then devoted to a comparison between the bounded transform and the modular transform .",
    "notice that the modular transform does not in general have a bounded extension to @xmath13 but that a sufficient condition for this to happen is that the modular operator @xmath37 has a bounded inverse .    with the knowledge of the relationship between unbounded modular cycles and classes in @xmath0-theory in place",
    ", we can state our second main result :    [ t : relkasint ] suppose that @xmath6 is a differentiable @xmath1-correspondence with left action factorizing through the compacts and suppose that @xmath36 is an unbounded modular cycle .",
    "let @xmath50 \\in kk_0(a , b)$ ] and @xmath43 \\in kk_m(b , c)$ ] denote the corresponding classes in @xmath0-theory .",
    "let also @xmath51 \\in kk_m(a , c)$ ] denote the @xmath0-class of the unbounded modular cycle @xmath52 .",
    "then we have the identity @xmath53 = [ x ] \\hot_b [ d]\\ ] ] in the @xmath0-group @xmath54 .",
    "the proof of this theorem does again not follow the usual scheme in unbounded @xmath0-theory .",
    "indeed , the standard method that is available for recognizing an unbounded representative for the interior kasparov product is to invoke the machinery invented by kucerovsky , @xcite .",
    "however , the results of kucerovsky does not apply in the context of unbounded modular cycles because of our systematic use of twisted commutators instead of straight commutators .",
    "instead of applying kucerovsky s ideas we have found it necessary to rely directly on the notion of an @xmath55-connection as introduced by connes and skandalis , @xcite .",
    "let us end this introduction by giving a more tangible corollary to our main theorems .",
    "consider a countable union @xmath56 of bounded open intervals @xmath57 .",
    "for each @xmath58 we then choose a smooth function @xmath59 with support equal to the closure @xmath60 .",
    "after a rescaling we may assume that @xmath61 for all @xmath58 ( where @xmath62 denotes the supremum norm ) .",
    "define the first order differential operator @xmath63 and let @xmath64 denote the closure .",
    "we then have the following result :    the triple @xmath65 is an odd spectral triple and the associated class in the odd @xmath66-homology group @xmath67 agrees with the interior kasparov product of ( the @xmath0-classes associated with ) the @xmath1-correspondence @xmath68 and the ( flat ) dirac operator on the real line .",
    "of course there is a similar kind of corollary where the setting is given by an arbitrary spectral triple @xmath69 together with a sequence of elements @xmath70 in the algebra such that @xmath71 \\| \\leq 1/k$ ] for all @xmath58 .",
    "when the algebra @xmath72 is non - commutative it is however not true that one obtains a new spectral triple out of this construction . in the general case it becomes necessary to twist all the commutators appearing by the modular operator @xmath73 and the framework that we are developing here is therefore fine - tuned for treating this kind of examples .",
    "the union @xmath56 appearing in the introduction is referred to as a _",
    "fractral string _ when it is bounded and when the open intervals are disjoint .",
    "i am grateful to michel lapidus for making me aware of this example , @xcite .",
    "we begin this paper by fixing our conventions for the analytic properties of the @xmath74-algebras appearing throughout this text .",
    "we have found that the conventional setup of banach spaces is not adequate for capturing the relevant structure on our @xmath74-algebras .",
    "indeed , it will soon become apparent that one needs to fix the analytic behaviour not only of the @xmath74-algebra itself but of all the finite matrices with entries in the @xmath74-algebra . the notion of operator spaces is therefore providing the correct analytic setting and we will now briefly survey the main definitions . for more details",
    "we refer the reader to the books by blecher - merdy and by pisier , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath75 and @xmath76 be hilbert spaces , and let @xmath77 be a subspace ( of the bounded operators from @xmath75 to @xmath76 ) which is closed in the operator norm",
    ". then the vector space @xmath78 of finite matrices over @xmath6 has a canonical norm @xmath79 coming from the identifications @xmath80 .",
    "the properties of the pair @xmath81 are crystallized in the next definition .",
    "notice that the above construction yields a canonical norm @xmath82 on the finite matrices over @xmath83 since @xmath84 . for each @xmath85 the norm @xmath86 coincides with the unique @xmath1-algebra norm .",

    "we may then conclude that @xmath724 and that @xmath725 .",
    "this proves the lemma .                            to prove the first of the two estimates we apply lemma [ l : algide ] to obtain that @xmath742 after a consultation of lemma [ l : eleesti ] and lemma [ l : eleestv ] ( together with assumption [ modassu ] ) we then see that it suffices to find a constant @xmath573 such that @xmath743 but this follows by noting that @xmath744 ( see the proof of lemma [ l : eleestiv ] ) .",
    "we begin with the easiest one : @xmath753 . using the identity in",
    "we obtain that @xmath754 it then follows by the results in subsection [ ss : preopenor ] that there exists a constant @xmath694 such that @xmath755 for all @xmath364 .",

    "to take care of the second term in we let @xmath757 be given .",
    "it then suffices to estimate the norm of the operator @xmath758 uniformly in @xmath503 and @xmath364 . in order to achieve this goal",
    "we notice that @xmath759 we now define @xmath760 and it follows that @xmath761 for all @xmath364 and all @xmath503 .",
    "our next step is to estimate the operator norm of each of the terms @xmath762 and @xmath763 uniformly in @xmath364 and @xmath503 .",

    "<S> the lack of an adequate projectivity condition on our differentiable module entails that the usual class of unbounded kasparov modules is not flexible enough to accommodate the unbounded kasparov product and it becomes necessary to twist the commutator condition by an automorphism .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that the unbounded kasparov product makes sense in this twisted setting and that it recovers the usual ( bounded ) kasparov product after taking bounded transforms . since our unbounded cycles are twisted ( or modular ) we are not able to apply the work of kucerovsky ( nor any of the earlier work on the unbounded kasparov product ) for recognizing unbounded representatives for the bounded kasparov product . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , since we do not impose any twisted lipschitz regularity conditions on our unbounded cycles , even the passage from an unbounded cycle to a bounded kasparov module requires a substantial amount of extra care . </S>"
