    "ion beams can be used in a variety of different ways to synthesize and modify materials on the nanometer scale . by adjusting ion species , ion energy , ion fluence and irradiation geometry it is possible to tailor the ion irradiation conditions for specific needs . in ion beam irradiation process",
    ", the kinetic energy of incident ions is transferred to atomic / lattice and electronic systems of solids through elastic collision and electronic excitation / ionization , respectively .",
    "the transferred energy to the lattice system induces atomic displacements directly . in the electronic excitation / ionization process ,",
    "on the other hand , atomic displacements can be caused as a result of indirect energy transfer from irradiating ions @xcite . for ions at a higher energy ( @xmath10 100 kev / amu ) , the energy ( a few kev/@xmath11 ) is mainly deposited via electronic excitation and ionization processes @xcite . in most insulators , when the highly localized energy deposited on target electrons is transferred from the electrons to the target lattice , an extended damage is induced along the ion path : the so - called latent track @xcite . in metals , however , atomic displacements through the electronic excitation / ionization had been considered to hardly occur because of rapid energy dissipation by a large number of free electrons @xcite . in the last two decades , nevertheless , atomic displacements induced by high - density electronic excitation have been found even in pure metallic targets @xcite .",
    "the question of the transformation of the energy deposited by the incident ion during the slowing - down process into energy stored in the target as lattice defects is still to be answered .",
    "two mechanisms have been proposed : ( i ) the thermal spike ( ts ) model in which the kinetic energy of target electrons excited by incident ions is transferred to the lattice system through electron - lattice interaction after rapid energy diffusion in the electronic system @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the coulomb explosion ( ce ) model in which the electrostatic energy of the space charge created just after the ion passage is converted into coherent radial atomic movements leading to a cylindrical shock wave @xcite .",
    "both mechanisms are sensitive to the deposited energy density as well as to the rate of energy loss ( de / dx ) .",
    "the ts model of latent track formation is a well established approach that has been successfully applied to insulators , semiconductors , metals , intermetallic compounds and polymers @xcite . because of the complexity of all energy relaxation processes involved ,",
    "this model is also subjected to criticism .",
    "however , the ts model seems to be the most elaborated one ; furthermore , to our knowledge , currently it is the only model being able to provide at least approximate predictions on latent track formation in numerous conducting and non - conducting targets .    for swift heavy ions ( shi ) ,",
    "i.e. , ions having velocity comparable to or larger than the orbital electron velocity of the lattice atoms , the energy dissipation in the lattice takes place mainly through ionization and electronic excitation @xcite .",
    "the rapid energy transfer during the electronic excitation can result in a variety of effects in materials including amorphization , defect creation , defect annealing , crystallization , etc .",
    "there have been numerous studies on the effects of shi irradiation in different varieties of targets including insulators , semiconductors and metals , where electronic energy loss ( @xmath12_{e}$ ] ) is projected as the major parameter that determines the energy relaxation processes and the resultant effects in materials @xcite .",
    "but if a systematic analysis is done on the effects of shi irradiation in semiconductors , it can be observed that the effects produced are determined not only by the electronic energy loss ( @xmath12_{e}$ ] ) but also by the physical properties of the target materials @xcite .",
    "several material properties ( such as carrier concentration in the present study ) that are also influenced by the synthesis conditions seem to decide the ion beam induced effects and are of extreme importance in determining the response of a material to the shi beam @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report our studies on the effect of shi irradiation in @xmath0 polycrystalline thin films differing in their conductivity .",
    "there exist few reports in the literature discussing the effect of shi irradiation on the structural , optical , electrical and sensing properties of @xmath0 thin films grown using different deposition techniques @xcite .",
    "however , no systematic studies have been carried out to verify the role of material properties such as carrier concentration ( n ) in determining the energy relaxation processes of shi in @xmath0 thin films .",
    "highly conducting @xmath0 thin films were prepared using chemical spray pyrolysis technique .",
    "dehydrate stannous chloride @xmath13 @xmath14 ( sigma aldrich purity @xmath15 99.99% ) was used for making the spray solution for @xmath0 thin films .",
    "an amount of 11.281 gm of @xmath16 ( sigma aldrich purity @xmath15 99.99% ) was dissolved in 5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid by heating at @xmath17 for 15 min .",
    "the addition of hcl rendered the solution transparent , mostly , due to the breakdown of the intermediate polymer molecules .",
    "the transparent solution thus obtained and subsequently diluted by methyl alcohol , served as the precursor .",
    "the amount of spray solution was made together 50 ml .",
    "the spray solution was magnetically stirred for 1 h and finally was filtered by a syringe filter having 0.2 @xmath18 m pore size before spraying on the substrate .",
    "fused quartz slides ( 10 mm @xmath19 10 mm @xmath19 1.1 mm ) , cleaned with organic solvents , were used as substrates . during deposition ,",
    "the substrate temperature was maintained at @xmath20c .",
    "the solution flow rate was maintained at 0.2 ml / min by the nebulizer ( droplet size 0.5 - 10 @xmath18 m ) .",
    "one set of as - deposited films were annealed in air for 2 h at 850@xmath1c .    to observe the effect of shi irradiation",
    ", these as - deposited and annealed @xmath0 thin films were irradiated with 120 mev au ions using a 15 mv pelletron accelerator at inter university accelerator centre ( iuac ) , new delhi .",
    "irradiation was done at six different fluences : @xmath3 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath4 ions/@xmath25 .",
    "the fluence values were estimated by integrating the charges of ions falling on the samples kept inside a cylindrical electron suppressor .",
    "the ions were incident perpendicular to the surface of the samples .",
    "a high vacuum of @xmath26 torr was maintained in the target chamber during the bombardment .",
    "ion beam was raster scanned on the film surface by a magnetic scanner for maintaining a uniform ion flux throughout the film .",
    "beam current was kept constant during experiments and it was around 0.5 particle nanoampere .",
    "one sample of each group was left unirradiated in the chamber and was used as the reference sample .",
    "we divided our samples into two groups , viz .",
    "group a and group b. group a consists of films which are as - deposited and irradiated ( without any post deposition annealing ) . on the other hand , group b",
    "consists of films which underwent post deposition annealing and were further irradiated .",
    "the gross structure and phase purity of all films were examined by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) technique using a bruker axs , germany x - ray diffractometer ( model d8 advanced ) operated at 40 kv and 60 ma . in the present study ,",
    "xrd data of group a and group b thin films were collected in the scanning angle ( @xmath27 ) range @xmath28 using @xmath29 radiations ( @xmath30 = 1.5405 @xmath11 ) .",
    "the experimental peak positions were compared with the data from the database joint committee on powder diffraction standards ( jcpds ) and miller indices were assigned to these peaks .",
    "atomic force microscopy ( afm ) was performed with multi mode spm ( digital instrument nanoscope iiia ) in afm mode to examine the microstructural evolution and root mean square surface roughness of the sample before and after irradiation .",
    "hall measurements were conducted at room temperature to estimate the film resistivity ( @xmath31 ) , donor concentration ( n ) and carrier mobility ( @xmath18 ) by using the four - point van der pauw geometry employing keithley s hall effect card and switching the main frame system .",
    "a specially designed hall probe on a printed circuit board ( pcb ) was used to fix the sample of the size 10 mm @xmath19 10 mm .",
    "silver paste was employed at the four contacts .",
    "the electrical resistivity and the sheet resistance of the films were also determined using the four probe method with spring - loaded and equally spaced pins .",
    "the probe was connected to a keithley voltmeter constant - current source system and direct current and voltage were measured by slightly touching the tips of the probe on the surface of the films .",
    "multiple reading of current and the corresponding voltage were recorded in order to get average values .",
    "thickness of the deposited films was estimated by an ambios surface profilometer and was approximately 500 nm .",
    "the electronic energy loss ( @xmath8 ) , nuclear energy loss ( @xmath32 ) and maximum penetrable range ( @xmath33 ) of the 120 mev au ions in @xmath0 are 27.19 kev @xmath34 , 0.479 kev @xmath34 and 8490 nm , respectively @xcite .",
    "the variation of @xmath8 and @xmath32 with depth in @xmath0 matrix for 120 mev au ions is shown in fig .",
    "1 . near the surface of the film , @xmath8 exceeds @xmath32 by two orders of magnitude and is almost constant throughout the film thickness , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "this reveals that the morphological and structural changes in @xmath0 thin film on irradiation by 120 mev @xmath2 ions are almost exclusively due to electronic energy losses .",
    "the swift heavy ion initially interacts with the atomic electrons ( electronic subsystem ) of the target material and transfers its energy to electrons ( valence and core electrons ) in a time less than @xmath35 s. the transfer of the excess heat energy of the excited electronic subsystem to the lattice subsystem may lead to an increase in the local temperature of the target material and therefore a high energy region is developed in the close vicinity of the ion path .",
    "the amount of energy transferred ( locally ) depends on the coupling between the electronic and atomic subsystems .",
    "this coupling is known as electron - phonon coupling ( g ) and it can be defined as the ability of electrons to transfer their energy to the lattice . according to szenes @xcite ,",
    "the value of g depends on the carrier concentration ( n ) in the target material .    to induce melting of the material or to create columnar defects in material a certain threshold value of @xmath8",
    "is required and according to szenes @xcite `` thermal spike model '' the value of @xmath9 depends on the material parameters such as density @xmath31 , average specific heat c , melting temperature @xmath36 , irradiation temperature @xmath37 , initial width of the thermal spike a(0 ) , and electron - phonon coupling efficiency g , and can be determined from the following equation : @xmath38 the value of a(0 ) , for semiconductors , depends on their energy band gap @xmath39 , while for insulators it is almost constant .",
    "this ion induced thermal spike width a(0 ) in semiconductors can be best approximated by the expression @xmath40 where b and c are constants . using an @xmath39 value of 3.6 ev for @xmath0 , the value of a(0 )",
    "was determined from the plot of @xmath41 versus a(0 ) as given in reference-10 , and was found to be @xmath42 nm .",
    "the efficiency with which energy deposited in the electronic subsystem is subsequently transferred to the lattice is governed by the electron - phonon coupling parameter g where typically @xmath43 @xmath15 @xmath44 . according to szenes @xcite",
    ", the value of g depends on electron concentration ( n ) .",
    "it is found that , for conductive materials ( n @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath7 ) , the value of g is @xmath10 0.092 @xcite , while for insulators it is @xmath10 0.4 @xcite . in a later section ,",
    "we have reported the results of electrical measurements . from these measurements",
    "we can say pristine samples of group a ( as - deposited @xmath0 ) are in conducting state with n = @xmath6 @xmath7 and pristine samples of group b ( annealed @xmath0 ) are in insulating state .",
    "the value of @xmath9 for as - deposited and annealed @xmath0 films was calculated from equation ( 1 ) by substituting the values of material density ( @xmath31 = 6.99 @xmath47 ) , average specific heat ( c = 0.3490 @xmath48 ) , melting temperature ( @xmath36 = 1898 k ) @xcite , irradiation temperature ( @xmath37 = 300 k ) for @xmath0 . for the as - deposited @xmath0 films the threshold value of track formation or amorphization @xmath9 ( estimated by using a(0 ) = 6.2 nm and g = 0.092 @xcite ) is 31.92 kev @xmath34 .     and nuclear energy loss @xmath32 with depth for 120 mev @xmath2 ions in @xmath0 matrix as determined by srim",
    ". ratio of @xmath8 /@xmath32 is @xmath10 60 .",
    "the inset shows the almost constant value of @xmath8 for even 600 nm depth from the surface of the film.,title=\"fig:\",width=321,height=249 ] +    in this case , the @xmath8 value is less than the threshold value required to induce amorphization / melting of material and we expect that only point defects or clusters of point defects will be produced in as - deposited @xmath0 thin films . for annealed @xmath0 films",
    "the value of @xmath9 ( calculated by using a(0 ) = 4.5 nm and g = 0.4 @xcite ) is 3.868 kev @xmath34 , which is much smaller than the available @xmath8 of 27.19 kev @xmath34 induced by 120 mev @xmath2 ions .",
    "therefore , latent track formation / amorphization / melting is only possible in the annealed films ( samples of group b ) but not in the as - deposited films ( samples of group a ) . the value of threshold electronic energy loss @xmath9 in as - deposited and annealed @xmath0 films along with values of @xmath8 , @xmath32 and r are listed in the table i. for permanent damage , the maximum temperature reached at the some local region needs to be significantly higher than the melting temperature ( 1898 k for @xmath0 ) .",
    "the structure of grains is changed ( spherical to ribbon / rod like ) only when melting is observed and the nature / size of the new structure corresponded closely to the maximum molten region .",
    ".the values of nuclear energy loss ( @xmath32 ) , electronic energy loss ( @xmath8 ) , and range ( @xmath33 ) for 120 mev @xmath2 ions in a @xmath0 thin film estimated by srim @xcite . the threshold value of electronic energy loss @xmath49 and possibility of track formation are also mentioned . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     another scattering mechanism popular in unintentionally doped semiconductors is the ionized impurity scattering . according to the brooks - herring formula @xcite , the relaxation time for coupling to ionized impurities is in the degenerate case , given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 the carrier concentration of ionized impurities and",
    "f(x ) given by @xmath52 with @xmath53 the screening radius @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the relative dielectric permittivity and @xmath57 is the effective mass of the carriers .",
    "the mobility ( @xmath18 ) is defined as @xmath58 substitution of the @xmath59 expression [ eq . ( 7 ) ] in eq . (",
    "11 ) yields the expression for mobility due to ionized impurities as @xmath60 since all the @xmath61 defects present in the as - deposited @xmath0 films will be fully ionized at room temperature , impurity ion concentration will be equal to the free carrier concentration .",
    "thus taking @xmath51 = n , @xmath57 = 0.31 m , @xmath56 = 13.5 @xcite and using eq .",
    "( 5 ) in eq .",
    "( 12 ) we get simplified form as @xmath62 with @xmath63 the calculated mobility and measured mobility values for as - deposited @xmath0 thin films are 9.747 and 11.291 @xmath64 respectively , both are comparable to each other .",
    "this clearly indicates that the main scattering mechanism reducing the intra - grain mobility of the electrons in as - deposited @xmath0 films is the ionized impurity scattering .",
    "ionized impurity scattering with singly ionized @xmath61 donors best describes the mobility of as - deposited @xmath0 samples .",
    "this finding supports our assumption that @xmath61 defect is source of conductivity in as - deposited @xmath0 sample .",
    "the mobility of electrons in non - degenerate semiconductor increases with temperature and is independent of the electron concentration , whereas the mobility in a highly degenerate semiconductor is nearly independent of temperature and increases with electron concentration @xcite .",
    "+     +    the surface morphology of group a and group b samples were investigated by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) using a nanoscope iiia from digital instruments operating in tapping mode .",
    "4 shows the afm micrographs of group a and group b samples .",
    "4(a ) shows the morphology of the as - deposited @xmath0 film ( pristine sample of group a ) which has nanostructures with broader size distribution in the range from 15 to 50 nm .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) roughness is 5 nm . when this as - deposited @xmath0 film is irradiated with @xmath4 @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "4(b ) ) , there is a significant increment in rms roughness ( 23 nm ) and crystallite size .",
    "the dimension of nanostructures becomes 30 to 60 nm . fig .",
    "4(c ) shows the surface morphology of an annealed @xmath0 film ( pristine sample of group b ) .",
    "after annealing , the nanostructures become almost spherical in shape with size in the range of 50 to 150 nm and rms roughness of 15 nm .",
    "the increment in grain size is caused due to the thermal heating induced growth in crystallinity .",
    "these grains are aligned in a particular direction leading to increment in rms roughness .",
    "it is clear from the fig .",
    "4(c ) that annealed",
    "@xmath0 films show granular nanostructure with distinct grain boundary . figs .",
    "4(d)-(i ) shows surface morphologies of the annealed samples irradiated with @xmath3 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath4 @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the irradiated samples of group b show that nanostructures get started to alteration at the lower irradiation fluence of @xmath3 @xmath5 .",
    "the grains are still distinct and not cobbled together at lower irradiation fluence .",
    "remarkable changes can be seen in @xmath21 @xmath5 fluence irradiated film .",
    "the nanostructures get entirely smashed via eliminating boundaries and the new aggregated grains of unusual morphology are appeared on the sample surface .",
    "this arrangement of structures , under shi irradiation , is expected to be governed by the confinement of a high density of energy of bombarding ions in the volume of individual grains and grain diffusion process .",
    "4(i ) shows the surface of the group b film irradiated with @xmath4 @xmath5 fluence .",
    "morphology of this film is very much different from that shown in fig .",
    "at this condition nanoribbon / nanorod like structures with size in the range of 200 - 300 nm and rms roughness of 15 nm are grown in lateral direction on the surface .",
    "the details of the morphological studies are summarized in table - iii .",
    "morphology of irradiated film depends on the conductivity of target material .",
    "if the target material is a conductor ( pristine sample of group a : @xmath65 ) then conduction electrons rapidly spread the energy of incident ion throughout the material and we find similar pristine / target sample like morphology with some dimensional change after irradiation ( see figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) ) .",
    "but if target material is an insulator ( such as pristine sample of group b ) then projectile ions can not spread their energy throughout the target material and therefore they create high energy region in the close vicinity of their paths .",
    "this cylindrical region around the path of the ion may become fluid if maximum temperature reached at the centre is higher than the melting temperature of the material .",
    "the structure of grains is changed ( spherical to ribbon / rod like ) only when melting is observed and the nature / size of the new structure corresponded closely to the maximum molten region .",
    "the approximate value of molten zone radius on the annealed @xmath0 film surface is @xmath10 7.26 nm . by considering 14.52 nm as the diameter of the molten zone on the annealed film surface , the critical fluence to cover the total surface with molten zones",
    "is found to be about @xmath66 @xmath5 .",
    "thus , beyond this critical fluence there will be a considerable overlapping of molten zones ( see fig .",
    "the nanoribbon / nanorod like morphology was first observed at @xmath67 @xmath5 , which is higher than the value @xmath66 @xmath5 of ion fluence .",
    "this shows that the nanoribbon / nanorod like structures are not created by single - ion impact but rather they are the result of overlapping of molten zones .",
    "the typical amorphous nanoribbon / nanorod like structures may arise on the surface of the high fluence ( @xmath15 @xmath66 @xmath5 ) irradiated films due to rapid resolidification of the molten layer . according to the principles of solidification [ 79 ] ,",
    "the morphology of solidified material is controlled by the temperature gradient ( g ) in the liquid near the advancing interface and by the growth rate ( r ) .",
    "melt recoil pressure , surface tension , diffusion and evaporation dynamics may also affect the resolidification process of molten layer and consequently the structure of grains .",
    "highly conducting @xmath0 thin films were successfully deposited by spray pyrolysis technique on quartz substrates at 425@xmath1c .",
    "one set of as - deposited films were annealed in the air by increasing the substrate temperature to 850@xmath1c for 2h .",
    "these as - deposited and annealed films were irradiated with 120 mev @xmath2 ions at six fluence values of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath67 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath5 using 15 mv pelletron tandem accelerator .",
    "the analysis of x - ray diffraction patterns reveals that the as - deposited and annealed tin oxide thin films are pure crystalline with tetragonal rutile phase of tin oxide which belongs to the space group p@xmath73/mnm ( number 136 ) .",
    "electrical measurement shows that as - deposited @xmath0 films are in conducting state with n = @xmath6 @xmath7 and annealed @xmath0 films are in insulating state .",
    "the results of electrical measurements suggest that @xmath61 defects in as - deposited @xmath0 thin films are responsible for the conductivity . through electrical investigation",
    "it has also been found that the main scattering mechanism reducing the intra - grain mobility of the electrons in as - deposited @xmath0 films is the ionized impurity scattering .",
    "ionized impurity scattering with singly ionized @xmath61 donor best describes the mobility of as - deposited @xmath0 samples .",
    "the amorphized latent tracks are created only above a certain threshold value of @xmath8 , which directly depends on the free electron concentration ( n ) .",
    "the electronic energy loss ( @xmath8 ) of 120 mev @xmath2 ions in @xmath0 is greater than the threshold energy loss ( @xmath9 ) required for the latent track formation in annealed @xmath0 thin film , but is less than @xmath9 required for as - deposited @xmath0 film .",
    "therefore , the latent tracks are formed in the annealed @xmath0 film and not in the as - deposited @xmath0 film .",
    "thermal spike model is used for the calculation of threshold energy loss and radius of melted zone .",
    "the possible mechanism of the structural changes and surface microstructure evolutions is briefly discussed in the light of ion s energy relaxation processes and target s conductivity .",
