    "the rest - frame optical emission lines are indispensable diagnostics of the activity in galaxies . in the local universe , the measurement of lines from [ oii]@xmath23727 through",
    "[ sii]@xmath17 has traditionally provided essential information on properties such as the star formation rate ( sfr ) ; the physical state of the ism ( e.g. , electron temperatures and densities , gas - phase metallicities ) ; the dust reddening ; and may also indicate whether an agn is present .",
    "thus , it may seem like a conspiracy of nature that for @xmath18 , where star formation and agn activity reach their global maxima ( shapley 2011 and references therein ) and observing these lines is critical to the study of galaxy evolution , they are shifted into the near - infrared , where spectroscopic observations from the ground are difficult due to the bright sky background .    one way to partially circumvent the difficulties posed by the forest of near - infrared terrestrial lines is to use narrowband filters which are designed to transmit in dark regions of the sky spectrum .",
    "such filters can be employed to blindly detect and measure emission lines at select redshifts . in the past , this technique has been successfully used with red - sensitive optical imagers to search for ly@xmath0 emitters at the highest redshifts ( e.g. , taniguchi et al . 2003 and references therein ) . however , the near - ir instrumentation required to enable analogous surveys for galaxies via their rest - frame optical emission lines at `` cosmic high noon '' became readily available only around the mid-2000 s .",
    "initial attempts with the first generation of ir imagers with small fields - of - view were heroic , but had limited success .",
    "for example , teplitz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) collected a total of @xmath548 hours of keck observations with nirc ( 38  fov ) , and found a sample of just 13 candidates .",
    "even up to 2007 , only a couple of hundred measurements of h@xmath0 in field galaxies past @xmath3@xmath5 0.4 had been published ( e.g. , tresse et al .",
    "2002 ; erb et al .",
    "2006c ) . with the gradual maturation of wide - field near - infrared cameras however , efforts by a few independent groups ( villar et al . 2008 ; geach et al . 2008 ; sobral et al . 2009 ; hayes et al .",
    "2010 ) , including our own ( ly et al . 2011 ; j.c .",
    "lee et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) , have now succeeded in increasing the total number of candidate h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath19 by an order of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , while using strategically designed filters allows for deep samples of emission - line galaxies at intermediate redshifts to be obtained , additional data are still needed to identify the line responsible for the detected narrowband photometric excess .",
    "unambiguous determinations can be made with spectroscopy . however , since spectra are not usually immediately available for the selected sources , other strategies , typically based on broadband photometry and colors , are first used to deduce the nature of the excess ( e.g. , fujita et al .",
    "2003 ; kodama et al .",
    "2004 ; ly et al . 2007",
    "; shioya et al . 2008",

    "coarse filtering may be the only method available to discriminate between different line emitters , since a prohibitive investment of telescope time is still required to obtain near - ir spectroscopy for large and deep samples ( e.g. , geach et al .",
    "the resulting contamination rate and incompleteness will vary depending on the depth of the photometry and number of colors available ( e.g. , 15 - 30% contamination if @xmath20 selection is used to select h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath11 ; ly et al .",
    "2011 ) , but will be most severe for young , blue galaxies , since the primary spectral feature providing information on the approximate redshift , the balmer/4000   break , is weak or non - existent in such populations .    to address such issues , we have attempted to improve upon the basic narrowband technique .",
    "specifically , we wish to enable the prompt identification of h@xmath0 emitting galaxies at @xmath21 , and also provide an initial glimpse into the state of the ism which is encoded into the rest - frame optical emission - lines .",
    "rather than use a single narrowband filter , we have designed a pair of filters , both of which sample dark regions of the near - ir sky spectrum , and are coupled to capture h@xmath0 and [ oii]@xmath23727 over the same redshift volume .",
    "emission - line galaxy candidates are selected through detection of a photometric excess in a filter at 2.10 @xmath1 m , and h@xmath0 emitters are then isolated through the presence of a second narrowband excess at 1.19 @xmath1m./h@xmath0 dual narrowband selection technique has just recently been also used by sobral et al .",

    "@xmath23 \" ( @xmath2=1.617 @xmath1 m ) , respectively . ]",
    "the h@xmath0 line is of particular interest because its flux is a primary indicator of the instantaneous star formation rate ( sfr )  the dust - corrected h@xmath0 luminosity is directly proportional to the ionizing flux .",
    "the [ oii ] flux has also been used as an sfr indicator , but its strength is more strongly dependent on the metallicity and the ionization state of the gas . the observed [ oii]/h@xmath0 ratio thus can provide a coarse combined measure of the metallicity and reddening ( e.g. , nakajima et al . 2012 ) .",
    "furthermore , this technique yields an excellent sample of emission - line galaxies at z=2.2 for follow - up nir spectroscopy , as three key lines , [ oii ] , and h@xmath0 along with the flanking [ nii ] lines , are already pre - selected to fall in clean windows of the oh sky spectrum .    here",

    "the dataset is the deepest of its kind : the exquisite image quality ( @xmath5055 fwhm ) resulting from the combination of instrument , telescope and site results in 1.19 @xmath1 m and 2.10 @xmath1 m imaging which probe 3@xmath6 emission - line depths down to 1.0@xmath710@xmath8 erg s@xmath9 @xmath10 and 1.2@xmath710@xmath8 erg s@xmath9 @xmath10 respectively , and is competitive with recent hawk - i narrowband observations at the 8.2 m vlt ( e.g. , hayes et al .",
    "our @xmath12 h@xmath0 sample extends the luminosities and sfrs probed by the well - studied uv - selected @xmath21 galaxies of erb et al .",
    "( 2006c ) by a factor of at least two .",
    "optimization of the data reduction and analysis will further enable us to increase the depth of the sample by up to 40% .",
    "we compute constraints on the faint - end slope of the @xmath12 h@xmath0 luminosity function using both the dual narrowband selected h@xmath0 emitters ( n=41 ) , and a combined sample of dual narrowband and photometric redshift selected galaxies ( n=50 ) .",
    "fitting of a pure power - law gives an upper - limit on @xmath0 of @xmath1390.31 , which is steeper than other recent estimates based on coarser selection techniques , but consistent within the large uncertainties that currently characterize such measurements .",
    "combining our lf points with those at higher luminosities from other work , the slope decreases to @xmath16 .",
    "additional data recently obtained from an fourstar pointing targeting the candels area in the cdf - s will enlarge the sample , and tighten this constraint .",
    "these  narrow - deep \" fourstar observations have been obtained as part of the larger newh@xmath0 survey , which will combine the data with  wide - shallow \" imaging through a similar narrowband filter pair with newfirm at the kpno / ctio 4 m telescopes , to carry out a statistical study of both luminous ( but rare ) and faint emission - line galaxies in the intermediate redshift universe .",
    "the dataset , in combination with the wealth of multiwavelength observations available in the extragalactic deep fields targeted , form the basis for follow - up studies on the physical properties ( morphologies , dust , metallicities , recent star formation histories and stellar populations ) of star - forming galaxies at a critical phase in their evolution .",
    "the fourstar observations , in particular , enable study of lower mass members of the population , even probing sfrs down to lmc - type activities of a few tenths at @xmath83 .",
    "this project , including the purchase of the custom narrowband filters , was made possible through the support of hubble and carnegie fellowships awarded to jcl .",
    "special thanks are due to the fourstar instrument team and carnegie observatories , whose dedicated , long - term efforts to build an exceptional camera have enabled the science imagined for over a decade .",
    "we thank ryan quadri and rik williams for useful discussions on using the eazy photometric redshift code , and gabe brammer for providing the most recent version of the code .",
    "helpful discussions with ranga - ram chary about the application of extinction curves , with peter capak about luminosity functions , and with dan kelson about aspects of fourstar data reduction are acknowledged .",
