    "they are more typical of the blue , faint end of the galaxy @xmath4band luminosity function , a population for which it is difficult to measure redshifts or metallicities , in the absence of grbs , due to their inherent faintness .",

    "* ) . however , spectroscopy of the afterglows by @xcite and berger et al .",
    "( in prep . ) has revealed a wealth of absorption lines which have been used to derive the metallicity and gas column density in the vicinity of the burst .",
    "absorption spectroscopy of the three bursts presented here have yielded neutral hydrogen gas densities in their host galaxies of : @xmath62=21.6\\pm 0.1 $ ] ( 060223a ) , @xmath63=21.3\\pm 0.1 $ ] ( 060510b ) , and @xmath63=21.0\\pm 0.3 $ ] ( 060522 ) .",

    "for grb060522 the signal - to - noise of the spectrum is too low to clearly identify any metal lines and an estimate of the metallicity is thus not possible . in the case of grb060223a , we find an upper limit on the column density of of @xmath64<15.3 $ ] , leading to a metallicity of @xmath65}<-1.45 $ ] .",

    "the metallicity estimates of the grb hosts along with their rest - frame @xmath75band luminosities ( assuming a @xmath76 color of 0 , typical of star - forming galaxies ) are shown in figure 3 . also shown for comparison are the metallicity - luminosity relationships for different samples of field galaxies . despite the one detection and two limits for the luminosity of the host galaxies , the figure shows that the redshift evolution of metallicity at a fixed @xmath75band luminosity that is seen between @xmath77 , clearly extends out to @xmath17 .",
    "the chemical enrichment of galaxies is directly related to their past history of star - formation since supernovae and stellar winds are responsible for recycling the products of nucleosynthesis back into the interstellar medium .",
    "the stellar mass density is the time integral of the star - formation history . by comparing the redshift evolution of the stellar mass density ( @xmath78 ) ( e.g * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , with the redshift evolution of the metallicity ( @xmath28 ) , we can search for evolution of the stellar initial mass function and assess the role of feedback in the build - up of galaxies .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "observations of the hosts are crucial , since they enable metallicity comparisons to be made at a fixed rest - frame @xmath4band luminosity , over a wide range of redshifts .    due to the fact that we have constraints on the @xmath4band luminosity and metallicity of only one @xmath17 grb host , we make the assumption that the median metallicity at each redshift , is that of a galaxy which has a similar luminosity as the grb host .",
    "this is not an unreasonable assumption . within the observational uncertainties",
    ", the slope of the mass - metallicity relation appears to be invariant between @xmath18 and @xmath79 @xcite .",

    "the average estimated @xmath78 at these redshifts are 1.4 , 6 and 56 in units of 10@xmath84  m@xmath6  mpc@xmath14 ( see references above ) .",
    "we performed a monte - carlo analysis to obtain the best fit between @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "star - forming galaxies which fall on the local mass - metallicity relationship , show a scatter of @xmath560.1 dex at bright luminosities and @xmath560.2 dex at faint luminosities @xcite .",
    "we use a random number generator to offset the stellar mass density and metallicity by the observed scatter from the mean values quoted above ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* table 3 for the range in stellar mass density ) .",
    "we fit for the relation between @xmath87 and repeat the process 10000 times .",
    "we find that @xmath88 appears to be invariant between @xmath89 and that @xmath90 .",
    "this suggests that the chemical enrichment of star - forming galaxies takes place at a slower rate than the build up of stellar mass .",
    "this is presumably due to the loss of metals from low - mass galaxies by outflows and stellar winds , an effect which is primarily responsible for the mass - metallicity relation seen in the local universe @xcite and @xmath79 lyman - break galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , alternate mechanisms such as depletion of metals onto dust grains can not be ruled out at this time .",
    "there is the possibility of a selection effect in this analysis .",
    "if long duration grbs arise in collapsars , they might preferentially be in low - metallicity galaxies . as a result , it is possible that grb hosts have a lower metallicity than the average field galaxy of the same rest - frame optical luminosity . although grb hosts appear to be have low luminosities in the rest - frame uv and @xmath4band , the observational evidence does not indicate that the hosts have an unusually low - metallicity for their luminosity .",
    "metallicity of grb host galaxies appear to span the range 0.1@xmath411  z@xmath91 ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and some of the hosts have even been found to be associated with dusty , infrared luminous galaxies ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , we assess the reliability of our derived @xmath87 relation by considering a bias in the metallicity of grb environments .",
    "if we assume that the metallicity of the grb environment is higher by @xmath920.3 dex compared to the mean metallicity of a galaxy at its luminosity , it implies that the mean metallicity at @xmath17 for a field galaxy at the luminosity of the grb host is -1.15@xmath930.15 .",
    "the best fit relation to the three points is then consistent with an exponent of unity i.e. @xmath94 but has a worse @xmath95 .",
    "the corollary is that if grb hosts were biased by 0.3 dex towards lower metallicities , compared to the mean metallicity of a galaxy at its luminosity , the best fit relation is @xmath96 which is a larger deviation from unity .",
    "furthermore , if there were a bias in grb host metallicities , the slope of the @xmath87 relation derived above at a fixed @xmath75band luminosity , would have a different value between @xmath97 and @xmath77 due to the fact that the @xmath77 relation is determined from star - forming galaxies while the @xmath97 relation is derived from grb hosts and lyman - break galaxies .",
    "this is inconsistent with our fits , although larger samples of grb hosts are needed to eliminate suggestions of bias .",
    "detection of individual grb hosts at high redshifts is likely to remain difficult , due to their intrinsic faintness .",
    "there is a clear need for homogeneous infrared surveys of grb host galaxies which will enable stacking to be performed as a function of metallicity , gas density and rest - frame ultraviolet properties . within our sample , grb050904 is a marginal irac detection @xcite , while grb060223a is dominated by detector systematics . as a result",
    ", we are unable to provide additional constraints using stacking .",
    "observations of a larger sample of grb hosts , such as those currently being targeted in  program go4 - 40599 ( pi : chary ) , will allow the luminosity - metallicity relation to be measured at high redshift and lead to a better understanding of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function , a regime which is currently inaccessible even through ultradeep surveys like goods and the udf .",
    "it is now well known from various mid - infrared , far - infrared and submillimeter surveys , that the star - formation rate density at @xmath98 is dominated by infrared luminous galaxies with l@xmath99=l@xmath100  l@xmath6 and l@xmath99/l@xmath101 ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at @xmath102 , current long - wavelength surveys ,",
    "due to their limited sensitivity , are unable to detect galaxies which harbor the bulk of the star - formation .",
    "thus , rest - frame ultraviolet observations of galaxies are the only avenue for probing star - formation at high redshifts .",
    "the primary uncertainties associated with quantifying the sfrd at @xmath103 , are the contribution from galaxies at the faint end of the uv - luminosity function and dust corrections .",
    "since sub - l@xmath104 galaxies contribute @xmath5690% of the sfrd , measurement of the faint - end slope of the ultraviolet luminosity function , where completeness corrections and surface brightness dimming issues are significant , needs to be undertaken carefully @xcite .",
    "similarly , if extinction were a significant issue , the galaxies that dominate the star - formation rate density would be uv - faint or undetected in magnitude limited rest - frame ultraviolet surveys .",
    "grbs are relatively insensitive to these limitations . if the grb rate density were correlated with the co - moving star - formation rate density at lower redshifts , where cross - calibration between the uv and ir are in broad agreement , measurement of the grb rate density at @xmath103 could provide an independent pathway to quantifying the sfrd ( see also e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "the three parameters which are most likely to dominate the calibration between grbs and the star - formation rate density are the evolution of metallicity with redshift , evolution of the initial mass function of stars and identification and spectroscopic follow up of the grb afterglow .",
    "if long duration grbs were to preferentially occur in low metallicity environments , the increase in the average metallicity of the universe with decreasing redshift would result in a higher sfr / grb - rate ratio at low redshift .",
    "similarly , evolution of the stellar initial mass function from a  top - heavy \" to a salpeter mass function with decreasing redshift would increase the sfr / grb - rate ratio at low redshift . on the other hand",
    ", the detection efficiency and spectroscopic completeness of grbs should be increasing with decreasing redshift , implying a lower sfr / grb - rate ratio at low redshift .    calibrating each of these parameters individually is challenging at the present time , partly because the relationship between grb rate and environment is not well known and due to the fact that observational selection effects can not be quantified .",
    "therefore , we need to rely on empirical comparisons between known star - formation rate estimates and grb rate densities to assess grbs as a star - formation rate indicator",
    ". this empirical comparison can be optimally done at @xmath105 since in this redshift range the star - formation rate , including the dust obscured component , has been accurately determined from deep mid - infrared and submillimeter surveys .",
    "we use the star - formation rate density at @xmath105 from @xcite .",
    "we distribute the 52  grbs with spectroscopic redshifts into redshift bins and divide by the co - moving volume in each redshift bin .",
    "we also correct for the time dilation to estimate the comoving grb rate density over the @xmath106 year  lifetime .",
    "the redshift bin at @xmath107 is omitted since the grb rate density appears to be anomalously high compared to the rapidly evolving star - formation rate density .",
    "we find that within the uncertainties , the rate density of grbs with spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath108 is constant at a value of @xmath109 mpc@xmath14 yr@xmath13 .",
    "this can be compared with the extinction - corrected comoving star - formation rate density in the same redshift range which is in the range 0.12@xmath410.25m@xmath6 yr@xmath13 mpc@xmath14 and has an average value of @xmath55 m@xmath6 yr@xmath13 mpc@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "since these two independent rate densities are relatively constant in the @xmath108 range , we can tentatively make the assumption that the sfr / grb - rate is constant ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the ratio of these two rates implies : @xmath110 where sfrd is the extinction - corrected star - formation rate density in m@xmath6 yr@xmath13 mpc@xmath14 and grb rate is in units of mpc@xmath14 yr@xmath13 .    using our derived calibration , and the measured grb rate densities at @xmath111 and @xmath112 of @xmath113 and @xmath114 mpc@xmath14 yr@xmath13 , respectively",

    "mid - infrared surveys have confirmed the dominant contribution of infrared luminous galaxies to the star - formation rate density at @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the grb rate density is almost flat between @xmath118 , while parameters such as the detection efficiency and spectroscopic completeness should be decreasing with increasing redshift , implies that the measured grb rate density provides at least a lower limit to the star - formation rate density .",

    "similarly , @xcite derive a star - formation rate density at @xmath16 by integrating the luminosity function of lyman - break galaxies in the udf and other deep fields . integrating the uv luminosity function down to 0.2@xmath123 results in a value of @xmath124",

    "the agreement between the sfrd values estimated from ultraviolet surveys and the grb rate density is reassuring , considering that there have been only 8 grbs that have been spectroscopically confirmed to be at @xmath19 ( figure 4 ) .",

    "<S> we present deep 3.6  observations of three @xmath0 grb host galaxies with the _ spitzer space telescope_. the host of grb060510b , at @xmath1 , is detected with a flux density of @xmath2 @xmath3jy , corresponding to a rest - frame @xmath4band luminosity of @xmath5 l@xmath6 , or @xmath7 l@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we do not detect the hosts of grbs060223a and 060522 and constrain their rest - frame @xmath4band luminosity to @xmath9 l@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> our observations reveal that @xmath0 grb host galaxies are a factor of @xmath10 less luminous than the median luminosity of spectroscopically - confirmed @xmath0 galaxies in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) and the _ hubble _ ultra deep field ( udf ) . </S>",
    "<S> the strong connection between grbs and massive star formation implies that not all star - forming galaxies at these redshifts are currently being accounted for in deep surveys and grbs provide a unique way to measure the contribution to the star - formation rate density from galaxies at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function . by correlating the co - moving star - formation rate density with co - moving grb rates at lower redshifts </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate a lower limit to the star - formation rate density of @xmath11 and @xmath12 m@xmath6 yr@xmath13 mpc@xmath14 at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is in excellent agreement with extinction corrected estimates from lyman - break galaxy samples . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our observations provide initial evidence that the metallicity of star - forming galaxies evolve more slowly than the stellar mass density between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , probably indicative of the loss of a significant fraction of metals to the intergalactic medium , especially in low - mass galaxies . </S>"
