    "regular covers and emulators are only used when citing results of negami and kitakubo ; for detailed definitions see @xcite ( for covers ) and @xcite ( for emulators ) .",

    "if a graph @xmath3 embeds in @xmath11 , then @xmath12 is a planar double cover of @xmath3 .",
    "conversely , in @xcite negami proved that if a connected graph @xmath3 admits a finite planar _ regular _ cover , then @xmath3 embeds in @xmath11 .",
    "negami conjectured that this holds in general :    [ conj : negami ] a connected graph has a finite planar cover if and only if it embeds in the projective plane .",

    "hence , if it admits a finite planar cover , negami s planar cover conjecture is false .",
    "the work of archdeacon , fellows , hlinn , and negami shows that the converse also holds , and negami s planar cover conjecture is in fact equivalent to @xmath1 having no finite planar cover ; see , for example , @xcite or @xcite and references therein . at the time of writing",

    "each triangle is simply a corner of the cube ( 3 squares ) .",
    "note that the graph presented in figure  [ fig : archdeaconsgraph ] is not a cover of @xmath0 .",

    "@xmath1 is constructed as follows : start with the 1-skeleton of an octahedron ( figure  [ fig : cube ] ) and add a seventh vertex , denoted @xmath14 , that is connected to all the vertices of the octahedron . the graph shown in figure  [ fig:1222 ] maps to the 1-skeleton of the octahedron ; each vertex is shown as a small circle labeled by the vertex of the octahedron it gets sent to .",

    "these vertices all map to @xmath14 and are connected to every vertex on the boundary of the shaded cells . on the boundary of each",
    "shaded face we see all the labels , so each of the vertices that map to @xmath14 has all the necessary neighbors .",
    "finally , we see that each vertex in figure  [ fig:1222 ] is on the boundary of at least one shaded face ; hence , every vertex has a neighbor that maps to @xmath14 .",
    "_ by viewing @xmath16 as the boundary of the convex hull of the midpoints of the edges of the cube or the octahedron , we may draw the emulator for @xmath1 symmetrically , so that it is invariant under the antipodal involution .",
    "the quotient gives an emulator for @xmath1 that has 133 vertices and embeds in @xmath11 .",
    "this symmetric presentation of the emulator of @xmath1 reveals another interesting property . by considering the eight triangular faces ( each shown in figure  [ fig:1222 ] as a white triangle with a single shaded face )",
    ", we can see that they are formed from the union of 4 great circles , one with the labels 0 , 1 , 2 , one with the labels 2 , 3 , 4 , one with the labels 1 , 3 , 5 , and one with the labels 0 , 4 , 5 .",
    "note that if we two color the faces of the octahedron , we have exactly all the faces of one color ."
