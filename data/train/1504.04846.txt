    "a negative feedback mechanism determines the thermal evolution of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) in the inner regions of cooling flow ( cf ) clusters and groups of galaxies ( @xcite ; some examples include @xcite ) .",
    "this feedback mechanism is driven by active galactic nucleus ( agn ) jets that inflate x - ray deficient cavities ( bubbles ; e.g. , @xcite ) . examples of bubbles in cooling flows include abell 2052 @xcite , ngc 6338 @xcite , ngc 5044 @xcite , and hcg 62 @xcite , among many others .",
    "vortices inside the bubbles and in their surroundings play major roles in the formation of bubbles , their evolution , their interaction with the icm , and the dynamics and formation of cold regions ( e.g. @xcite ) . some cool regions further cool and flow inward to feed the agn .",
    "the process of feeding the agn with cold clumps in the feedback mechanism cycle is termed the _ cold feedback mechanism _ , and was suggested by @xcite .",
    "the cold feedback mechanism has been later strengthened by observations of cold gas and by more detailed studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that the mixing of the hot bubble gas with the icm is a much more efficient heating process than heating by repeated shocks ; hereafter termed shocks - heating . as the axis of the bubbles changes with time and/or the central jets source and the icm move relative to each other , e.g. , the galaxy group ngc 5813 @xcite , over time the mixing - heating operates in all directions .",
    "shocks - heating is extremely inefficient , and is unlikely to explain the feedback mechanism @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue for shocks - heating in ngc  5813 , ignoring the counter arguments for shocks - heating in ngc  5813 @xcite .",
    "we hold that even in ngc  5813 mixing is more important than shocks in heating the icm @xcite .",
    "this heating by mixing closes the cycle in the cold feedback mechanism .",
    "a key to the study of the mixing heating is to inflate bubbles self - consistently .",
    "this requires either slow ( sub - relativistic ) massive wide ( smw ) jets @xcite , precessing jets @xcite , or a relative motion of the jets to the medium @xcite . in the present study we inflate bubbles by smw jets , also supported by observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but our results hold for bubbles inflated by precessing jets or a relative motion of the icm as well .    in a recent paper @xcite claim that heating by turbulence dominates in the perseus cooling flow cluster .",
    "we here compare the energy that jet - inflated bubbles channel to turbulence and to the direct thermal energy of the icm .",
    "the axi - symmetric 2d simulations of @xcite and @xcite are insufficient to account for the vortices and turbulent motion , which are expected to be fully three - dimensional .",
    "therefore , as 2d axi - symmetry restricts the motion and changes the character of the turbulence invoked , for the goal of this paper , that is to study the role of turbulent heating , we lift this restriction and employ 3d simulations .",
    "the 3d numerical setting is described in section [ s - numerical - setup ] . in sections [ s - flow - structure ]",
    "we present the flow structure , and in section [ s - heating - the - icm ] we study the heating of the icm .",
    "our short summary is in section [ s - summary ] .",
    "we use the pluto code @xcite for the hydrodynamic simulations , in a three - dimensional cartesian grid with adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) .",
    "the computational grid is in the octant where the three coordinates @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are positive . at the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 planes we apply reflective boundary conditions .",
    "the @xmath2 coordinate is chosen along the initial axis of the jets .",
    "in reality two opposite jets are launched simultaneously , such that the flow here is assumed to be symmetric with respect to the @xmath5 plane , amounting to reflective boundary conditions at @xmath5 .",
    "the base computational grid ( lowest amr level ) spans the cube @xmath6 , with @xmath7 divisions in each direction . up to @xmath8 amr levels",
    "are employed with a refinement ratio of @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the highest resolution is @xmath10 .",
    "the refinement criterion is the default amr criterion in pluto v. 4.1 , based on the second derivative error norm @xcite of the total energy density .",
    "heat conduction and viscosity are not included in the simulations .",
    "however , local heat conduction is expected to be efficient on scales of @xmath11 ( @xcite ) , and therefore is effectively incorporated via the resolution of the simulations and does not need to be included .",
    "the conclusions are found not to be sensitive to the resolution .",
    "magnetic fields , also not included in the current numerical study , would in reality prevent global heat conduction , but not local heat conduction .",
    "the vortices would entangle field lines , leading to local magnetic field line reconnection and hence allowing local heat conduction .    in this study",
    "we examine the increase in the kinetic energy of the icm .",
    "the kinetic energy results from turbulence , sound waves , and gas motion induced by cavity motion , i.e. , cavity heating @xcite .",
    "the dissipation of turbulence ( e.g. , @xcite ) and sound waves ( e.g. , @xcite ) heats the gas .",
    "we do not include dissipation , but we calculate the increase in the kinetic energy of the icm and term it in short turbulence .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that it actually includes the energy of sound waves and uplifted gas , hence we do account for sound wave heating and cavity heating .",
    "if the dissipation is not @xmath12 efficient in transferring kinetic to thermal energy , then we are overestimating this turbulent energy source for heating .",
    "the heating by shock waves is examined directly , as shock dissipation is treated by the numerical code .",
    "heating by cosmic rays , e.g. , @xcite , are not included in our simulations at all . on the outer boundaries we use an outflow boundary condition .",
    "at the boundary @xmath5 we inject into the grid a jet with a half - opening angle of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the jet material is inserted through a circle @xmath14 on the @xmath5 plane with a radius of @xmath15 .",
    "the initial jet velocity in the nominal case is @xmath16 , a mach number of about @xmath17 .",
    "the direction of the velocity at each injection point @xmath18 in the circle is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "the jet is injected during each active episode , and when the jet is turned off reflective boundary conditions apply in the whole @xmath5 plane . in the nominal run",
    ", the jet is periodically turned on for @xmath21 and off for @xmath21 .",
    "the power of the two jets together is @xmath22 half of it in each direction .",
    "the mass deposition rate is thus @xmath23    in two additional simulations we vary two parameters . in one simulation ,",
    "termed run b below , we reduce the jet activity and quiescence time intervals by a factor of @xmath8 . in a different simulation , run c , we increase the velocity by a factor of @xmath24 and lower the mass deposition rate , keeping the jet power unchanged .",
    "as we do not include magnetic fields , hence their influence on instabilities , the roles of magnetic fields in the mixing process and in small scale motions are not explored here .",
    "although in two dimensions magnetic fields act to stabilize some instabilities ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in three dimensions the magnetic fields can not suppress instabilities with wave - vector components perpendicular to the field lines . hence , we do not expect magnetic fields to suppress mixing , but only to influence the details of the mixing .",
    "another effect is that the violent vorticity we find can amplify magnetic fields to the point that they start to reconnect and heat the gas .",
    "this overall process channels kinetic energy to magnetic energy and then to thermal energy , hence increasing the heating efficiency of the mixing process .",
    "overall we do not expect magnetic fields to influence the main conclusions of this study .",
    "the simulation begins with an isothermal box of gas at an initial temperature of @xmath25 with a density profile of ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath26 ^ { 3 / 4}},\\ ] ] with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "a gravity field is added to maintain an initial hydrostatic equilibrium , and is kept constant in time .",
    "we include radiative cooling in the simulations , where the tabulated cooling function is taken from the solar - metalicity values of table 6 in @xcite .",
    "we run simulations with either @xmath29 or @xmath8 levels of amr , to check for numerical convergence .",
    "we found no noticeable differences in the results .",
    "we also run simulations with a twice as large grid and no reflecting boundary conditions on the plane @xmath30 .",
    "namely , the @xmath0-coordinate covers the range @xmath31 .",
    "we found no significant changes in the results , hence conclude that the reflecting boundary conditions do not affect our results , both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "we begin by presenting in fig .",
    "[ figure : flow structure ] the flow structure at different times .",
    "this high - resolution simulation was run for @xmath32 . to follow the evolution of the same setting for @xmath33 we used a lower resolution grid . in the common time the results of the two runs",
    "are similar .     +    as evident from fig .",
    "[ figure : flow structure ] , e.g. , at @xmath34 , we manage to inflate bubbles which match those seen in observations as x - ray deficient cavities @xcite .",
    "the inflation of bubbles similar to those observed in a self - consistent manner is crucial to the study of the different heating mechanisms : mixing , shocks , and the excitation of icm turbulence that can dissipate later on .    in order to compare to observational data , in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : imaging ] we present mock x - ray images of the nominal simulation at time @xmath35 .",
    "this image was created by folding the simulated octant twice , such that the four quarters of the plane are identical .",
    "although the initial setup of the simulation is cylindrically symmetric , hydrodynamic instabilities magnified numerically cause departures from that symmetry . in particular , the surface of the low density hot bubble is ripply and uneven , with several relatively dense filaments crossing that volume near the bubble s surface ( later discussed in relation to fig .",
    "[ figure : additional simulations ] ) .",
    "these appear as a net of bright filaments covering the dark ( low density ) bubble on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : imaging ] .",
    "present x - ray observations are not sharp enough to detect such filaments . in addition",
    ", more sophisticated simulations might have erased these filaments by including realistic local heat conduction .",
    "the ` waist ' between the two bubbles in the plane @xmath36 obtained here is wider than in typical observed bubbles .",
    "our method of injecting the jet , through a circle on the surface @xmath36 , is one of the causes of the wide waist near @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , on the plane @xmath36 we have reflective boundary conditions which add to the numerical error near the plane .",
    "however , overall , we obtain an image which reasonably resembles observations .    the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : imaging ] is an emission - weight temperature map at the same time , @xmath35 .",
    "the emission - weighted temperature at each point @xmath37 in the image is the average of the temperature , along the line of sight ( @xmath1-axis here ) , weighted by the emission power , @xmath38    for reference we also provide representative shock mach number values . at the front of the jet , on the @xmath2-axis ,",
    "the first shock wave running through the icm has a mach number of @xmath39 at @xmath40 and a mach number of @xmath41 when it reaches a distance of @xmath42 .",
    "as we show later , such weak shocks are insignificant in heating the icm .    to better capture some properties of the flow we present artificial flow quantities called ` tracers ' .",
    "the tracers are frozen - in to the flow , and hence represent the spreading with time of gas starting in a certain volume .",
    "a tracer s initial value is set to @xmath43 in a certain volume and @xmath44 elsewhere . if the traced gas is mixed with the icm or the jet s material , its value drops to @xmath45 .    in fig .",
    "[ figure : tracers tr1 ] we present maps of a tracer that follows the ejected jet material . in the simulation",
    "the jet is injected via the boundary condition at @xmath5 ( see section [ s - numerical - setup ] ) , and the injected material is marked with a tracer that follows its evolution throughout the simulation .",
    "we plot the tracer distribution in the @xmath4 meridional plane at two times as indicated in the different panels .",
    "each point in space in which the tracer value is @xmath46 indicates that material from the jet has reached it .",
    "we find again that a prominent phenomenon in such simulations of self - consistent bubble inflation is the appearance of vortices and mixing @xcite .",
    "the inflation of the bubble by the jet induces a complicated flow structure with multiple vortices , some induced by vortex shedding @xcite .     +    in the upper - left left panel of fig .",

    "vigorous mixing caused by vortices can be seen in these two panels , i.e. , the vortex at @xmath50 . in the upper - right panel",
    "we can notice jet s material that reaches the point @xmath51 .",
    "this clearly shows that the mixing of hot shocked jet s gas can heat the icm to large distances in directions perpendicular to the initial jet direction . considering that in a more realistic scenario the jets precess and eject material in other directions ,",
    "the mixing is more efficient even than what is found here .",

[ figure : tracers tr4 ] is initially pushed outward by the outgoing shock waves and the growing bubble of hot gas that induces sound waves . however , at @xmath58 it begins to be mixed with hot jet gas , as the large vortex induced by bubble inflation tears it apart . at @xmath59",
    "it becomes almost completely mixed with its surroundings as well as with the jet gas .",
    "the tracer of the gas starting further out and presented in fig .",
    "[ figure : tracers tr3 ] follows a similar pattern , but begins to be mixed with the hot bubble gas at much later times .",

    "the two lower panels that are given at the same time clearly present the efficient mixing of the icm and the hot bubble gas .",

    "the periodic jet activity induces gas motion in the icm such that the kinetic energy of the icm at each point varies with time .",
    "this variation is more or less in a periodic manner , with only a moderate increase in the kinetic energy over several periods .",
    "the gravitational energy changes by a negligible amount compared to both the kinetic and internal energies .",
    "the main energy increase over several periods comes from an increase of the internal energy .",
    "consider the middle panel in the left - hand column of fig .",
    "[ figure : energy history ] , which shows the energy history of the tracer presented in fig .",
    "[ figure : tracers tr4 ] .",
    "there are some variations due to two shock waves that pass through the traced region .",
    "the shocks increase the internal energy , but the gas re - expands and the net thermal energy gain is negligible .",
    "this traced mass begins to mix with hot bubble gas at @xmath80 . from that time on the mean internal energy increases significantly .",

    "[ figure : tracers tr1 ] show the presence of the jet material at the same time .",
    "it is apparent that the hot shocked jet ( bubble ) gas is being mixed vigorously with the icm gas marked by the tracer .",
    "the mixing is facilitated by the vortices induced by the jet - inflated bubble .",
    "similar heating by mixing happens in the tracer presented in fig .",
    "[ figure : tracers tr3 ] , whose energy history is shown in the bottom panel in the left - hand column of fig .",
    "[ figure : energy history ] . periodic heating by shocks is clearly seen , although over a long time shocks can not compete with radiative cooling . indeed , at early times the internal energy decreases .",
    "here the mixing begins at @xmath82 . in the @xmath83 panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : tracers tr3 ] we can see a vortex that is just about to touch the traced region and mix it with hot bubble gas that can be seen in the @xmath83 panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : tracers tr1 ] .",
    "the heating is mainly due to mixing of the icm gas with shocked jet material , i.e. , the hot bubble gas .",
    "both the mixing that leads to an increase in internal energy and the turbulent energy are driven by vortices .",
    "it is hard to estimate directly the amount of turbulent kinetic energy of the icm from the simulations , because the grid resolution is not high enough to capture all relevant scales .",
    "however , we give rough arguments that the kinetic energy we calculate is not much smaller than the corresponding ` true ' turbulent energy .",
    "firstly , the kinetic energy is calculated with respect to the center of mass of the whole system , and not with respect to a local mean flow of the gas .",
    "thus , it overestimates the turbulent energy as it is usually defined .",
    "secondly , our calculated kinetic energy does not properly include the kinetic energy in smaller scales than the grid resolution , and thus it underestimates the turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "however , the kinetic energy is mainly due to vortices which are significantly larger than the grid resolution .",
    "therefore , we do not expect that the underestimation of the turbulent kinetic energy in small unresolved scales is significant .",
    "thirdly , some of the kinetic energy we count is due to sound waves that propagate out and do not heat the inner region .",
    "finally , motion in smaller scales is less energetic , and it also tends to dissipate to internal energy .",

    "the flow maps for run c in the @xmath4 plane at t = 50 myr are shown in the right - hand side column of fig .",
    "[ figure : additional simulations ] . in all simulations",
    "the mean jet power is the same , eq .  ( [ eq : jet power ] ) .",
    "+    the detailed flow and vortex structure in the three simulations is dependent upon the parameters in a complicated way .",
    "however , we can draw conclusions which do not depend on the exact value of the parameters . in run",
    "b ( middle column of fig .",
    "[ figure : energy history ] ) , the time period of jet episode activity is @xmath8 times shorter . the immediate effect seen is the smaller and more frequent ` bumps ' as a result of the shock waves .",
    "in addition , the shape of the hot bubble is elongated in the direction of the axis of the jet , while maintaining a similar volume which depends only on the jet energy output .",
    "run c , with the higher jet velocity and lower mass deposition rate , has a similar general structure to the nominal run , but the details are different . in run c",
    "there is less momentum per unit mass and per unit energy , compared with the nominal run .",
    "the bubble front along the @xmath2-axis after @xmath32 extends only to @xmath87 , compared with @xmath88 in the nominal run . the vortex on the right side of the bubble in fig .",
    "[ figure : additional simulations ] is larger in run c than in the nominal run .",
    "the waist in run c is wider than in the nominal run .",
    "the nominal run better matches the morphology of observed bubbles .",
    "this is one of the reasons we use slow jets @xcite .",
    "another reason is recent observations of such outflows from agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the energy histories of the traced regions in these simulations , fig .",
    "[ figure : energy history ] , is similar to the nominal run with the following exceptions . in run",
    "b ( middle column of fig .",
    "[ figure : energy history ] ) , in the tracer shown in the bottom panel , the traced gas gets close to the hot bubble at @xmath89 but does not mix with the hot gas .",
    "the more frequent episodes create less vortices and in fact push out the traced gas almost continuously .",
    "in contrast , in the nominal run , where the jet is periodically turned on and off for @xmath21 , the longer quiescence time allows for the cooled icm gas to be pulled in to the center and thus to heat up by mixing with the hot bubble gas . in run",
    "b this happens to a lesser extent .",
    "thus , the traced icm gas remains in the dense shell surrounding the hot bubble , which in turn radiates its energy more efficiently .",
    "this radiative cooling is the cause of the decline of internal energy starting at time @xmath90 .",
    "as seen in this example , more shock waves ( keeping the jet power fixed ) may , in some cases , actually heat some of the icm gas less efficiently , because it pushes the gas out more continuously , which inhibits mixing .    similar cooling of the same traced region happens in run c , as seen in the bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "[ figure : energy history ] . here , the gas begins to mix at time @xmath91 , as in the nominal simulation .",
    "however , the slightly different vortex structure does not pull in the entirety of the traced gas and most of it remains out of the hot bubble , in the surrounding dense shell .",
    "thus , as in run b , it loses internal energy quickly by radiative cooling .",
    "this may be a mechanism for feeding the agn by cold gas .",
    "icm gas gets pulled in to the center during quiescence periods because of the lower pressure in the hot bubble , cools radiatively when its density increases , and is then pulled in further . at this stage",
    "it either heats up or cools further and falls in to feed the agn .",
    "the main results from the comparison of the different cases is as follows .",
    "because of the different flow structure in simulations with varying parameters , some of the gas heats up more and some less , depending on the location of the gas , but mixing is the main heating process among those probed in the simulations .",
    "we thus conclude by arguing that mixing , due to vortices , is more important as a heating process of the icm gas by jets than turbulent heating and shock heating .",
    "shock waves induce an expansion and contraction and increase kinetic energy by creating motion , but their contribution to the heating is largely temporary and almost periodic in our setting .",
    "turbulent motion is also not the main heating mechanism , although it might carry up to @xmath92 of the energy transferred from the jets to the icm .",
    "motivated by the recent claim of @xcite that turbulent - heating can counter radiative cooling in the cooling flow clusters virgo and perseus , we compare the energy channeled from jets to icm turbulence with the direct thermal heating by mixing hot bubble gas with the icm .",
    "we have done so by conducting 3d hydrodynamical simulations of wide jets that inflate bubbles .",
    "we used the pluto @xcite hydrodynamical code in cartesian coordinates .",
    "the inflation of bubbles leads to the development of vortices in the entire volume around the expanding jets and bubbles , as can be see in figs .",

    "these vortices excite turbulence in the icm .",
    "these vortices also efficiently mix icm gas with the hot bubble gas .",
    "this mixing can best be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure : tracers tr4 ] where the tracer ( colored red ) of icm gas located initially within a torus is seen to be mixed with the bubble gas .",
    "we use slow massive wide ( smw ) outflows .",
    "such flows are supported by observational findings ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in many cases",
    "outflows from agn include relativistic components . by comparing the results of run c with the nominal run , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ figure : additional simulations ] , we note that when the velocity is three times as high , the bubble stays wide and a large vortex exists on its side .",
    "higher velocities do not change the mixing part by much when wide ( fat ) bubbles are inflated .",
    "therefore , we do not expect that relativist outflow will change our present conclusions , as long as wide bubbles are inflated .",
    "for that , either the jets are wide , or there is a relative transverse velocity between the jets and the icm , e.g. , motion of the agn relative to the icm and/or jets precession @xcite .",
    "well - collimated relativistic jets without transverse velocity relative to the icm will not heat the icm efficiently away from their propagation cone .",
    "they will penetrate to large distances .",
    "they can form radio lobes at large distances , but will not heat the icm close to the center .",
    "we then compared the increase in thermal energy of the icm medium we trace , with the increase of its kinetic energy .",
    "we found that the energy channeled to directly heating the gas is more than 3 times larger than that channeled to kinetic energy of the icm , and typically larger than 4 times the kinetic energy .",
    "this is our main result and it is presented in fig .",
    "[ figure : energy history ] . as only part of the kinetic energy will turn to turbulence ( some is just large - scale motion ) , we conclude that turbulent - heating is @xmath93 as efficient as mixing - heating .",
    "heating by shocks is very small , as was shown in 2d simulations @xcite , and was reinforced here in 3d simulations .",
    "the significance of the new 3d simulations is that the vortices and turbulent motion is not artificially confined to be cylindrically symmetric .",
    "although the setup is cylindrically symmetric , small perturbations and numerical errors are magnified by hydrodynamic instabilities , and the flow is fully three - dimensional .",
    "this is the main difference observed in the 2d and 3d simulations .",
    "the conclusions regarding the heating mechanisms , nonetheless , are similar .",
    "it is important to note that since by our finding turbulence carries @xmath94 of the energy deposited by the jets in the inner region , turbulence may still be non - negligible in the icm , as was found recently by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and marginally by @xcite .",
    "however , since only a portion of the kinetic energy develops to turbulence , and since the total injected jet energy can be channeled into other forms of energy , in some cases turbulence might be insignificant .",
    "@xcite find observationally that turbulence is present and significant in the icm , and that the rate of turbulent heating matches the rate of radiative cooling .",
    "in contrast , in our simulations we have found that heating by mixing is more significant .",
    "our results further show that a non - negligible amount of energy ends up as kinetic energy of the icm .",
    "however , substantial heating occurs only when mixing takes place .",
    "in addition , we find large density fluctuations induced in the icm by the mixing process and bubble motion ; this is best seen in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ figure : additional simulations ] .",
    "it seems that a large fraction of the kinetic energy is not turbulent motion that dissipates .",
    "the kinetic energy and density fluctuations are associated also with the bubble activity and global gas motion ; only part of of the kinetic energy belongs to the universal turbulent cascade that @xcite refer to . @xcite",
    "write : `` it is difficult to prove unambiguously that we are dealing with a universal turbulent cascade , as other structures ( e.g. , edges of the bubbles , entrainment of hot bubble matter , sound waves , mergers and gas sloshing ) might also contribute to the observed density - fluctuation spectra . ''",
    "we suggest that the discrepency between the claim of @xcite for efficient turbulent heating and our finding results from a large fraction of the density perturbations and turbulent energy that is indeed in the other structures listed by them .",
    "this definitely deserves further investigation ."
