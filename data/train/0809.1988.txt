    "finding the first stars and galaxies remains a major observational challenge in astrophysics .",
    "searches for metal - free ( pop iii ) or extremely metal - poor individual stars or for ensembles of stars ( clusters , proto - galaxies , populations of galaxies , etc . )",
    "are ongoing both nearby ( pop iii stars in the halo of our galaxy ) , and in galaxies out to the highest redshifts currently known .",
    "astronomers have been quite inventive in searching for pop iii or metal - poor stars , exploiting many possible direct and indirect signatures ; some of these methods will be discussed below . a more detailed account on primeval galaxies , some of the physics related to these objects , an overview on searches etc .",
    "is presented in the lectures of schaerer ( 2007 ) .",
    "although some studies may have found signatures of pop iii stars , none of those claims is very strong ( see discussion below ) , and my personal opinion  taking a somewhat conservative attitude  is that pop iii still remain to be found .",
    "however , there is good hope that this goal should be reached in the quite near future with current or forthcoming instrumentation , as i will sketch below .",
    "many authors have modeled the evolution of pop iii stars in the 1980s and before . since",
    "then the interest in these stars has been revived , and new generations of models computed .",
    "subsequently i will use predictions from the stellar evolution and non - lte atmosphere models as well as the evolutionary synthesis models computed by schaerer ( 2002 , 2003 ) . for",
    "a detailed description of the input physics and references to earlier work the reader is referred to these papers .",
    "one of the main distinctive features of pop iii stars is their extreme compactness close to and on the zero age main sequence ( zams ) , implying much higher effective temperatures ( up to @xmath3 100 kk ) than usual . for a given mass",
    "this leads to a considerable increase of the ionising flux and to a much harder ionising spectrum ( cf .",
    "tumlinson et al .",
    "2001 , schaerer 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , if the conditions in metal - poor environments favour the formation of massive stars ( cf .",
    "bromm & larson 2004 , and contributions by abel , bromm , tan , and others in these proceedings ) , the integrated spectrum of young , zero and very low metallicity stellar populations can be quite different than that of populations at `` normal '' metallicities , as shown e.g. by schaerer ( 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "in particular , the strong ly@xmath0  line emission and the presence of nebular he  ii  emission lines are probably the best / easiest features to search for very metal - poor and pop iii objects .",
    "for example in figure 1 ( left ) we show the increase of the ionising ( lyman continuum ) photon flux @xmath4 normalised to the uv continuum luminosity with decreasing metallicity for different imfs ( salpeter , scalo ; b , c as in schaerer 2003 , and other imfs ) . for a fixed imf",
    "the increase from solar to zero metallicity is typically a factor of 2 ; assuming that more extreme imfs may be valid for pop iii , this increase can be up to a factor @xmath3 10 ( compared to solar and salpeter ) .",
    "note that this prediction also depends on the exact star - formation ( sf ) history , which affects in particular the uv continuum output .",
    "the right panel of fig .  1 shows the increase of the hardness of the ionising flux , expressed by the ratio of he@xmath5 to h ionising flux , @xmath6 , with decreasing metallicity .",
    "as already mentioned , the strong lyman continuum flux at low metallicities implies a strong intrinsic ly@xmath0  emission ( cf .",
    "schaerer 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "for example , the _ maximum ly@xmath0  equivalent width",
    "_ predicted for an integrated stellar population increases from @xmath3 200 - 300 to 500 - 1000   or even larger ( depending on the imf ) from solar to zero metallicity , as shown in fig .",
    "of course it must be reminded that after its emission inside the ionised region surrounding the starburst ly@xmath0  photons are scattered and may be absorbed , thereby altering the intrinsic value of @xmath7 ( see e.g.  schaerer 2007 ) .",
    "the increase of the hardness of the ionising radiation shown in fig .",
    "1 ( right ) translates into the increase of he  ii  recombination lines , such as he  ii @xmath11640 , shown in fig .  2 ( right ) .",
    "for obvious reasons their strength depends on the exact sf history , age , and in particular on the imf , as shown by these figures ( see also schaerer 2003 ) . while clearly a promising signature of very metal - poor populations as pointed out earlier1640  emission can also of different origin ( stellar cf .",
    "3.1 , agn or shocks ) and nebular he  ii  is observed in some normal h  ii  regions ( see e.g.   thuan & izotov 2005 ) or in other peculiar objects ( cf .",
    "fosbury et al .",
    "2003 and discussion in schaerer 2003b ) .",
    "] , this strong sensitivity to the presence of the most massive stars ",
    "i.e.  to the imf and age  may complicate the interpretation of he  ii  lines , especially when dealing with non - detections ( cf .  below ) .",
    "once the properties of individual pop iii clusters or galaxies are known , important questions are of course how many such objects are expected and what is their distribution , e.g. in mass and luminosity ? answering these questions",
    "requires in particular a description of the transport and mixing of metals to determine the duration ( locally ) of pop iii sf events .",
    "several authors have addressed this using different approaches ( e.g. scannapieco et al .",
    "2003 , yoshida et al .  2004 , tornatore et al .  2007 ) . the predicted pop iii sf rate , defined by sf in regions with @xmath8 , as a function of redshift from the recent computations of tornatore et al .  ( 2007 )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "3 . predicted number counts from choudhury & ferrara ( 2007 ) are shown in fig .  5 for illustration .",
    "it is possible that galaxies containing pop iii or very metal - poor stars have already been found in different samples . here",
    "i will critically examine some of these results .",
    "for example , jimenez & haiman ( 2006 ) have recently proposed an explanation to several apparent puzzles concerning lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and related objects at @xmath9 34 .",
    "they propose that their stellar populations contain @xmath3 1030 % of primordial stars , which would explain the observed he  ii @xmath11640  emission in lbgs , the existence of some galaxies with very high w(ly@xmath0 ) , the excess of lyman continuum flux seen in some lbgs , and the nature of ly@xmath0  blobs .",
    "although the idea to tackle simultaneously four problems is in principle attractive , the proposed solution is probably not unique and not the most likely one , and some of the 4 problems may not be robust observationally . first , the strength of the he  ii @xmath11640  line in the composite spectrum of lbgs is quite modest ( @xmath10  ) , and small enough to be explained by wolf - rayet stars in normal stellar populations ( cf .",
    "models of schaerer & vacca 1998 , and brinchmann et al .",
    "furthermore the observed line is broad , as observed in wolf - rayet stars .",
    "second , the existence of a population of galaxies at @xmath9 45 with high ly@xmath0 equivalent widths found by the lala survey , does not seem to be confirmed by other groups or is at least very uncertain ( see sect .",
    "third , other explanations are proposed for extended ly@xmath0  blobs ( e.g.  matsuda et al .",
    "finally , the proposed explanation may also have difficulties with mixing time scales ( pan & scalo 2007 ) .",
    "the excess of lyman continuum flux in some lbgs remains still puzzling ( see also shapley et al .",
    "2006 , iwata et al .",
    "2008 )      a few years ago malhotra & rhoads ( 2002 ) found ly@xmath0  emitters ( lae ) at @xmath11 with an unusual ly@xmath0  equivalent width distribution from their lala survey .",
    "they suggested that their large fraction of objects with a high w(ly@xmath0 ) ( @xmath12 200 - 300  ) could be due to very metal - poor or pop iii objects , a very unusual imf , or to agn .",
    "follow - up observations of these objects have been undertaken , also at x - rays , and several papers have already adressed these results ( see discussion in schaerer 2007 ) . the agn hypothesis has been rejected ( wang et al .",
    "deep spectroscopy aimed at detecting other emission lines , including the he  ii @xmath11640  line indicative of a pop iii contribution ( cf .",
    "sect .  4 ) , have been unsuccessful ( dawson  2004 ) , although the achieved depth may not be sufficient .",
    "if taken at face value , the origin of these high w(ly@xmath0 ) remains thus unclear .",
    "however , there is some doubt on the reality of these equivalent widths measured from nb and broad - band imaging , or at least on them being so numerous even at @xmath13 .",
    "first of all the objects with the highest @xmath14 have very large uncertainties since the continuum is faint or non - detected .",
    "second , the determination of @xmath14 from a nb and a centered broad - band filter ( @xmath15-band in the case of malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) may be quite uncertain , e.g.  due to unknowns in the continuum shape , the presence of a strong spectral break within the broad - band filter etc .",
    "( see hayes & oestlin 2006 for a quantification , and shimasaku  2006 ) .",
    "furthermore other groups have not found such high @xmath7 objects ( e.g.  hu  2004 , ajiki  2003 and compilation in verhamme et al .",
    "2008 ) suggesting also that this may be related to insufficient depth of the lala photometry .    recently shimasaku  ( 2006 ) and dijkstra & wyithe ( 2007 ) have again , used @xmath14 distributions to argue for a non - negligible contribution of pop iii stars in laes , this time in objects at @xmath16 .",
    "in fact the _ observed _ restframe values of @xmath14 lae samples at @xmath17 and 6.5 obtained with subaru are considerably lower than those of malhotra & rhoads at @xmath13 , and only few objects show @xmath18  , the approximate limit expected for `` normal '' stellar populations ( cf .",
    "fig .  2 ) .",
    "however , if the igm transmission @xmath19 affects half of the ly@xmath0  line , as often assumed ( see also hu et al .",
    "2004 ) , this would imply true intrinsic equivalent widths @xmath20 times higher than the observed value , i.e. typically 4 times higher at @xmath17 ! for this reason",
    "shimasaku   suggest that these may be young galaxies or objects with pop iii contribution .",
    "based on this reasoning and on modeling the ly@xmath0  luminosity function and igm transmission , dijkstra & wyithe ( 2007 ) argue for the presence of @xmath3 410 % of pop iii sf in @xmath3 half of ly@xmath0   selected galaxies and in few percent of i - drop galaxies at @xmath21 5.7 .",
    "although possible , this conclusion rests strongly on the assumption that the igm transmission ( due to individual or overlapping ly@xmath0  forest clouds ) really cuts out a significant fraction of the ly@xmath0  line emerging from the galaxy .",
    "this is by no means clear , e.g. since it implies the need for cold gas close ( and/or infalling ) to the galaxies , which has not been observed yet .",
    "the lbg cb58 studied in depth , savaglio et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find no ly@xmath0  absorption close to the galaxy ( at @xmath22 2000 km s@xmath23 ) .",
    "also verhamme et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find no need for igm absorption in their ly@xmath0  profile modeling of lbg / lae at @xmath9 35 .",
    "furthermore , absorbing a fraction of ly@xmath0  by the igm is even more difficult if the intrinsic ly@xmath0  profile emerging from the galaxy is already redshifted ( and asymmetric ) , as expected if outflows are as ubiquitous as in lbgs at lower redshift .",
    "assessing these important issues remains to be done . in the meantime conclusions depending strongly on corrections to the observed ly@xmath0  equivalent widths ( or lf )",
    "should probably be taken with caution .",
    "several groups have tried to use the expected he  ii @xmath11640  emission ( cf .",
    "2 ) to search for pop iii stars , so far with no positive detection .",
    "however , the limits obtained from most recent survey begin to provide interesting constraints .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy of lala sources by dawson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( cf .",
    "3.2 ) have yielded an upper limit of @xmath24 25   ( 3 @xmath25 ) and he  ii @xmath11640/ly@xmath0@xmath26 0.130.20 at 23 @xmath25 from their composite spectrum ( 11 objects ) .",
    "nagao  ( 2005 ) searched for he  ii @xmath11640  with deep spectroscopy of one strong ly@xmath0  emitter at @xmath27 .",
    "currently the lowest limit on he  ii  emission is that measured by ouchi et al.(2008 ) in composite spectra of 36 and 25 @xmath28 and 3.7 laes .",
    "they reach @xmath29he  ii @xmath11640@xmath30ly@xmath0@xmath31 0.02 and 0.06 ( @xmath32 ) at these two redshifts , which translates to @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectivelyhe  ii @xmath11640@xmath30ly@xmath0@xmath35 ( cf .",
    "s03 ) . ] .",
    "although no definite conclusions can be drawn from that , comparison with fig .",
    "1 ( right ) show that these limits are already close to the maximum or slightly below the predicted values for metal - free populations with imfs including very massive stars .      using an original approach combining narrow / intermediate - band filters to select dual ly@xmath0  + he  ii @xmath11640  emitters at @xmath36 and 4.6 ,",
    "nagao et al .  (",
    "2008 ) have carried out a survey of 875 arcmin@xmath37 using subaru in the subaru deep field ( see also nagao , these proceedings , for more details ) .",
    "no such dual emitters were found , down to a flux limit of @xmath38 erg s@xmath23 @xmath39for he  ii @xmath11640 . with some assumptions on the imf and using the models of s03",
    ", the observed flux limits translate to an upper limit for the pop iii sfr of @xmath40 m@xmath41 yr@xmath23 , and a sfr density of @xmath42 m@xmath41 yr@xmath23  mpc@xmath43 at @xmath44 ( nagao et al . 2008 ) .",
    "interestingly this first pop iii sfr density determination turns out to be very close to the theoretical prediction of tornatore et al .",
    "( 2007 ) shown in fig .",
    "clearly further work and deeper observations are required to track the elusive population iii at high - redshift and future theoretical work may provide a more detailed / accurate picture of the expectations .",
    "the impressive depth  down to few times",
    "@xmath46 erg s@xmath23 @xmath39   reached already in emission line searches with subaru , vlt , and keck is illustrated in fig .  4 , where ly@xmath0  measurements and upper limits obtained in the visible and near - ir domain are compiled .",
    "in the case of lensed galaxies the intrinsic depths can be considerably larger , as e.g.  shown for the candidate high - z galaxies of stark et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . in several cases of @xmath45 galaxies or candidates , spectroscopic follow - up observations",
    "have already been undertaken to search for various emission lines , including the potential pop iii indicator he  ii @xmath11640  discussed above ( e.g. pell et al .  2005 , stark et al .",
    "2007 , richard et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "since the average metallicity of galaxies must decrease with increasing redshift , searches for primeval galaxies and/or pop iii galaxies are also naturally focussed towards the highest redshift . at the same time galaxy searches at @xmath45",
    "are also of great interest to identify the sources of cosmic reionisation .    reviewing the status of galaxy searches / observations at @xmath45 is beyond the scope of the present contribution .",
    "for an overview see e.g.  schaerer ( 2007 and references therein ) .",

    "( 2008 ) and richard et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who use surveys in blank fields or fields with massive galaxy clusters benefiting from strong gravitational lensing . at the bright end of the lf the number density of galaxies at @xmath48 , and hence also the total sfr density , remains controversial ( cf .",
    "richard et al .",
    "2006 , bouwens et al .",
    "2008 ) . at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath49 27 ) the results from these two approaches ( blank fields and lensing clusters ) give consistent number densities ( see richard et al .",
    "the lensing cluster technique allows one to extend the observations to the faintest levels , currently down to an effective magnitude of @xmath50 2930 .",
    "clearly the two techniques , one with an additional gain in depth by lensing over a small area and the other over wide fields , are complementary and both approaches will likely play an important role in finding distant , primeval , maybe even pop iii dominated objects .",
    "the lensing studies show a source density of 3100 arcmin@xmath51@xmath52 for @xmath53 from @xmath54 to 30 ( richard et al .",
    "this source density is also in agreement with the theoretical predictions from stiavelli et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and choudhury & ferrara ( 2007 ) , shown in fig .",
    "5 . if spectroscopy of objects down to magnitudes of 30 or even 32 become feasible with extremely large telescopes ( cf .",
    "4 ) this means that we should expect very high source densities , e.g.  several hundred objects ( ! ) in a field of view of several arcmin@xmath55as foreseen for elt instruments .",
    "high multiplex multi - object spectrographs reaching with an optical and near - ir coverage up to @xmath56 m , such as eve proposed for the e - elt , should therefore be very efficient in detecting ly@xmath0  and he  ii @xmath11640  lines up to redshift 13 and 9.4 respectively .",
    "great progress can be expected from searches for the sources of cosmic reionisation and primeval / pop iii galaxies in the fairly near future !",
