    "there are many systems and processes where the time dependence of the centered second moment is not linear as in the classical brownian motion . such family of processes is called anomalous diffusion . in one dimension",
    "the anomalous diffusion is characterized by the power - law time dependence of the mean square displacement ( msd ) @xcite @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the anomalous diffusion coefficient .",
    "when @xmath4 , this time dependence deviates from the linear function of time characteristic for the brownian motion . if @xmath5 , the phenomenon is called subdiffusion .",
    "occurrence of subdiffusion has been experimentally observed , for example , in the behavior of individual colloidal particles in two - dimensional random potential energy landscapes @xcite .",
    "it has been theoretically shown that active particles moving at constant speed in a heterogeneous two - dimensional space experience self trapping leading to subdiffusion @xcite .",
    "usually it is assumed that subdiffusive behavior is caused by the particle being trapped in local minima for prolonged times before it escapes to a neighboring minima .",
    "continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) with on - site waiting - time distributions falling slowly as @xmath6 predict a subdiffusive behavior @xcite .",
    "superdiffusion processes , characterized by the nonlinear dependence ( [ eq : anomalous - diff ] ) of the msd on time with the power - law exponent in the range @xmath7 , constitute another subclass of anomalous diffusion processes .",
    "superdiffusion is observed , for example , in vibrated dense granular media @xcite .",
    "theoretical models suggest that supperdiffusion can be caused by lvy flights @xcite .",
    "lvy flights resulting in a superdiffusion can be modeled by fractional fokker - planck equations @xcite ( or langevin equations with an additive lvy stable noise ) . in many experimental studies",
    "it is only possible to show that signal intensity distribution has lvy law - tails : distribution function of turbulent magnetized plasma emitters @xcite and step - size distribution of photons in hot vapors of atoms @xcite have lvy tails .",
    "this indirectly shows that in these systems superdiffusion could be found .",
    "anomalous diffusion does not uniquely indicate the processes occurring in the system , because there are different stochastic processes sharing the behavior of the msd ( [ eq : anomalous - diff ] ) .",
    "the physical mechanisms leading to the deviations from the linear time dependence of the msd can depend on the system or on the temporal and spatial ranges under consideration .",
    "for example , diffusion described by ctrw has been observed for sub - micron tracers in biological cells @xcite , structured coloidal systems @xcite and for charge carrier motion in amorphous semiconductors @xcite .",
    "fractional brownian motion and fractional langevin equations has been used to model the dynamics in membranes @xcite , motion of polymers in cells @xcite , tracer motion in complex liquids @xcite .",
    "diffusion of even smaller tracers in biological cells has been described by a spatially varying diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "recently , in refs .  @xcite it was suggested that the anomalous diffusion can be a result of heterogeneous diffusion process ( hdp ) , where the diffusion coefficient depends on the position .",
    "spatially dependent diffusion can occur in heterogeneous systems .",
    "for example , heterogeneous medium with steep gradients of the diffusivity can be created in thermophoresis experiments using a local variation of the temperature @xcite .",
    "mesoscopic description of transport in heterogeneous porous media in terms of space dependent diffusion coefficients is used in hydrology @xcite . in turbulent media the richardson diffusion has been described by heterogeneous diffusion processes @xcite .",

    "the local cytoplasmic diffusivity has been demonstrated to be heterogeneous @xcite .",
    "motion of a brownian particle in an environment with a position dependent temperature has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in random walk description",
    "the spatially varying diffusion coefficient can be included via position dependence of the waiting time for a jump event @xcite , the position dependence occurs because in the heterogeneous medium the properties of a trap can reflect the medium structure .",
    "this is the case for diffusion on fractals and multifractals @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous versions of continuous time random walk models for water permeation in porous ground layers were proposed in ref .",
    "heterogeneous diffusion process might be applicable to describe anomalous diffusion in such systems .",
    "the goal of this paper is to consider hdps with the power - law dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the position and to analytically investigate the influence of external forces on the resulting anomalous diffusion .",
    "the influence of the external forces on hdps has not been systematically analyzed .",
    "in this paper we assume that the forces are characterized by a power - law dependence on the position .",
    "such forces can arise in various systems : in many cases the potentials causing the deterministic forces are power - law functions of position , for example linear and harmonic potentials .",
    "power - law potential with arbitrary power - law exponent acting on a nanoparticle have been created in ref .",
    "logarithmic potentials yielding forces behaving as @xmath8 have been applied to describe dynamics of particles near a long , charged polymer @xcite , momentum diffusion in dissipative optical lattices @xcite , long - range interacting systems @xcite , bubbles in dna molecules @xcite . as we demonstrate , the external force having a certain value of the power - law exponent does not restrict the region of diffusion and change only the anomalous diffusion coefficient without changing the scaling exponent @xmath9 .",
    "other values of the power - law exponent in the external force can lead to the exponential cut - off of the probability density function ( pdf ) and restrict the region of diffusion , limiting the time interval when the anomalous diffusion occurs .",

    "this behavior of the distribution in hdps is different than the behavior in ctrws , where there is a finite fraction of immobile particles resulting in the finite value of the distribution at @xmath35 .",
    "this difference allows to distinguish between different origins of anomalous diffusion .",

    "<S> we obtain analytic expressions for the transition probability in two cases : when the power - law exponent in the external force is equal to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the power - law exponent in the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the position , and when the external force has a linear dependence on the position . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the power - law exponent in the dependence of the mean square displacement on time does not depend on the external force , this force changes only the anomalous diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the external force having the power - law exponent different from @xmath0 limits the time interval where the anomalous diffusion occurs . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the results obtained in this paper may be relevant for a more complete understanding of anomalous diffusion processes . </S>"
