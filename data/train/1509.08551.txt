    "@xcite the latter determines the dynamics of specific residues in a protein primary sequence , which are active participants in the pathways of the biological function .",
    "biologically active segments are often mobile and adaptable to assume a proper configuration when binding to a reaction partner .",
    "the multiple configurational states that an active segment may populate are not randomly selected : configurations with minimal energy are connected by energy barriers , and as such are thermally activated , enabling emerging regions of high mobility , which can behave like  switches \" along the binding pathway.@xcite    different experiments and computational models exist to probe the dynamical processes of proteins , spanning the femtosecond regime of bond and angle vibrational modes to the millisecond and longer time regimes of folding and enzymatic kinetics .",
    "important information in the picosecond to tens of nanosecond regime can be collected through nmr relaxation experiments , such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , however their interpretation is model dependent .",
    "atomistic molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations can provide a realistic dynamical model , but for most proteins of interest sufficient sampling to obtain converged dynamical correlations is prohibitively costly , and a theoretical approach is needed .",
    "the theory we present here is the langevin equation for protein dynamics ( le4pd ) , which provides a coarse - grained but still physically realistic representation of biological macromolecules at the lengthscale of a single amino acid and larger .",
    "the le4pd theory describes the amino acid dynamics quantitatively , as the theory contains information about the extent of the intramolecular energy barriers , specific amino acid friction coefficient , semiflexibility , degree of hydrophobicity , as well as hydrodynamics .",
    "the le4pd accurately predicts the sequence - dependent dynamics starting from the ensemble of metastable structural configurations around the folded state measured by nmr , or from md simulations .",
    "input to the le4pd is an ensemble of structural configurations , which has to be representative of the distribution of folded states of the protein .",
    "while proteins sample a very large configurational space , with @xmath4 the number of independent sites comprising the protein , at the bottom of the funnel - like energy landscape the conformational diversity is much smaller.@xcite a common paradigm is that the important internal fluctuations of a folded protein span a limited number of specific structures,@xcite and these can be well sampled experimentally by nmr.@xcite if that is the case , nmr conformer ensembles should provide a structural ensemble consistent with well - sampled md simulations , and the le4pd coupled with structural nmr should provide predictions of the protein dynamics without need of performing lengthy computer simulations .",
    "@xcite in the diffusive mode description the le4pd identifies the regions of local flexibility and cooperative motion of the residues inside a protein . as an example we project the md trajectory onto the diffusive modes of the hiv protease monomer , and obtain a free energy landscape barrier height distribution which scales with mode cooperativity . using the scaling form for this barrier height distribution , which appears to be a general feature of protein dynamics , leads to accurate dynamical timescales in the simulation - free conformer - based le4pd model .",
    "the dynamical predictions of the le4pd model starting from an ensemble of structures generated from experimentally determined nmr conformers are compared with a second ensemble of structures generated in the course of an md simulation in the timescale of @xmath5 nanoseconds . to validate the accuracy of the theoretical predictions of the dynamics using the le4pd approach we test its predictions against experimental data of nmr relaxation for seven different proteins and 1876 site - specific nmr relaxation measurements . using either the md generated or nmr solution structure ensembles we obtain quantitatively self - consistent predictions , with similar overall correlation of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we find that , in general , the md - generated ensembles provide through the le4pd a closer agreement with experimental data than the le4pd informed by nmr ensembles , with 17% lower relative error .",
    "in the le4pd equation the dynamics of the protein is described as a diffusive motion across the configurational landscape,@xcite consistent with an optimized rouse - zimm theory of the dynamics of macromolecules in solution.@xcite proteins are anisotropic in shape and have a hydrophobic core which is only partially exposed to solvent , with this effect depending on the position of each amino acid in the protein .",
    "the le4pd includes both rotational anisotropy and the hydrophobic core , which are features characteristic of biological macromolecules but are uncommon in synthetic polymers in solution .",
    "local energy barriers in the interior of the protein are important to properly define its dynamics and are explicitly taken into account in the le4pd method .",
    "the langevin equation formalism is derived starting from the liouville equation for the conservation of probability density in the phase space of the full atomistic system of the protein and solvent , and using projection operators to obtain an equation of motion for the chosen sites.@xcite here the chosen coarse - grained sites are the @xmath8-carbon of each amino acid in the protein primary sequence .",
    "the intramolecular distribution around the folded state is assumed to be gaussian , and the parameters in the distribution are directly obtained from the starting configurational ensemble.@xcite the coarse - grained le4pd represents the balance of viscous dissipation with the entropic restoring force and a random brownian force due to the random collisions of the coarse - grained protein with the fast - moving projected atoms belonging to solvent , ions , and the protein .",
    "the time evolution of the coordinate of the coarse - grained site @xmath9 is well - described by the following equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath12 is the temperature , @xmath13 is the squared bond distance , and @xmath14 is the average monomer friction coefficient , defined as @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the friction of the monomer @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath17 is a delta - correlated random force due to projecting the system dynamics onto the coarse - grained sites , where fluctuation - dissipation requires @xmath18 where @xmath19 are cartesian indices .",
    "[ le1 ] is the well - known rouse - zimm equation for the dynamics of polymers in solution.@xcite    @xcite the elements in the matrix of the hydrodynamic interaction are defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the average hydrodynamic radius which is defined below .",
    "this is a perturbative hydrodynamic interaction accounting for the nature of the amino acid primary structure as a heteropolymer made up of building blocks of different chemical types , propagating through the aqueous solvent but screened in the dense hydrophobic core .",
    "the site - specific friction parameters , @xmath16 , are obtained by calculating the solvent - exposed surface area , and calculating the total friction of the @xmath22 site via a simple extension of stoke s law as @xmath23 here @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote , respectively , the viscosity of water and the radius of a spherical bead of identical surface area as the solvent - exposed surface area of the residue , the hydrodynamic radius@xcite , while @xmath26 denotes the hydrodynamic radius related to the surface not exposed to the solvent .",
    "the internal viscosity is @xmath27 , which we approximated in our previous work to be related to the water viscosity rescaled by the local energy - barrier scale @xmath28.@xcite the largest possible value of @xmath29 that maintains a positive definite solution of the matrix diagonalization is adopted to avoid the well - known issue with the preaveraging of the hydrodynamic interaction in dense systems.@xcite for example , in the application of the model to hiv protease , the calculated @xmath30 is very close to the adopted value of @xmath31 , which avoids negative eigenvalues .    because we focus only on the bond orientational dynamics and not translation , in the interest of a simpler notation we separate out the zeroth order translational mode from the internal dynamics .",
    "following the same notation introduced for the orientational dynamics of star polymers,@xcite we define @xmath32 as the @xmath33 matrix after suppressing the first row used to define the center of mass , and define @xmath34 .",
    "the orientational langevin equation governing the bond dynamics is @xmath35 with @xmath36 , and where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the random delta - correlated bond velocity .",
    "the first three global modes of the le4pd describe the rotations of the folded structure as the rotational diffusion tensor . for proteins which have an arbitrary folded structure , the full rotational diffusion equation of an anisotropic 3-dimensional body must be solved .",
    "this alters the relaxation of the three global modes describing the rotational relaxation in the inertial lab frame.@xcite    to account for the affect of the local energy barriers on the internal dynamics , the friction becomes mode dependent by assuming thermal activation over the mode - dependent energy barrier @xmath39 @xmath40 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] leading to the slowing of the mode timescale @xmath41 by @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "this simple dynamical renormalization provides an average correction to the dynamics of the langevin equation , which approximately accounts for the local barrier crossing , and is in agreement with free energy landscape theories suggesting activated dynamics.@xcite as a first approximation , the depth of the minimum free - energy well in the mode serves as the relevant barrier to transport .      to provide a further assessment of the accuracy of the le4pd for the local dynamics we compare its theoretical predictions with experimental data of nmr @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and noe relaxation .",
    "the physical quantities of interest for this test are the bond autocorrelation function and the second order legendre polynomial of the time dependent bond orientation .    for each bond",

    "another quantity of interest is the second order legendre polynomial of the time dependent bond orientation function @xmath47\\rangle-\\frac{1}{2}$ ] which can be related to the first order bond autocorrelation by @xmath48 which is a function of @xmath49 as @xmath50^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{m_{1,i}(t)}$ ] .",
    "this expression relies on assuming a gaussian form for the joint probabilities in normal mode coordinates.@xcite for dipolar relaxation , the fourier transform of @xmath51 defines the spectral density from which spin - lattice ( @xmath1 ) and spin - spin ( @xmath2 ) relaxation times , and nuclear overhauser effect ( noe ) can be calculated and compared with nmr measurements.@xcite",
    "the le4pd model predicts the dynamics of the protein using the structural ensemble as input . by generating a structural ensemble through relatively short time ( @xmath52 ) md simulations , the needed input for the le4pd",
    "was evaluated leading to accurate predictions for the global and site - specific dynamics of ubiquitin@xcite and the signal transduction protein chey.@xcite the accuracy of the simulations , however , depends upon the accuracy of the force - field used , and sampling the full configurational space    [ [ section ] ]    fluctuations around the local conformational states are imposed by applying a gaussian network model ( gnm).@xcite the gnm builds a harmonic network of interactions around each residue based on a distance cutoff criteria , and solves the resulting site - site fluctuations as a linear matrix equation .",
    "gnm models have been shown to reproduce well crystalline state fluctuations measured as debye - waller temperature factors ( b - factors ) and thus are a good representation of the short - time fluctuations while they require minimal computational effort . once combined with the le4pd",
    "the theory provides a realistic and computationally inexpensive prediction of the dynamics of proteins on a wide range of time scales , from the local fluctuations to the large , concerted , conformational transitions .    from the gnm we define the bond correlation matrix locally around the @xmath8th conformer @xmath53 .",
    "the gnm defines the pairwise fluctuations @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the kirchoff adjacency matrix defined using a cutoff radius of @xmath56@xcite and @xmath57 is the harmonic interaction strength .",
    "we found that in general a value of @xmath58 is needed to match the short - time @xmath59 orientational fluctuations of the protein from the md simulation .",
    "an interaction strength of @xmath60 is typically used with the gnm to predict crystallographic b - factors ; this order of magnitude difference in interaction strength may be due to the local anharmonic softening of the orientational potential energy surface due to the aqueous solvent.@xcite the boundary water layer of hydrated proteins in aqueous solution is highly mobile in the picosecond regime@xcite ; the constant shifting of the protein - water hydrogen bonds may lead to enhanced orientational fluctuations which are completely local in nature .",
    "this effect is absent in the crystalline state , where the hydration water is much more static .    recognizing that in the body - fixed reference frame @xmath61-[\\langle\\vec{r}_{i+1}\\rangle-\\langle\\vec{r}_{i}\\rangle]$ ] we can determine the local bond correlation matrix around each conformer as @xmath62 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the total @xmath63 matrix is then simply the average @xmath64 with @xmath65 the number of conformers in the nmr structural ensemble .",
    "similarly , the hydrodynamic matrix @xmath66 , the site friction coefficient @xmath16 , and all other input quantities to the le4pd , are calculated separately for each conformer and then the statistical average is taken over all the conformers .",
    "this is an extremely simplistic picture of the structural ensemble of a protein ; however the dynamics predicted by this structural ensemble generated by the set of nmr conformers is consistent in many ways with the much more detailed ensemble generated through the sophisticated process of explicit solvent md simulation .",
    "the set of nmr conformers provides us an ensemble of important metastable structural minima in the free energy landscape ; and the gnm provides fluctuations around these minima .",
    "molecular anisotropy , rotational diffusion , hydrodynamic interactions , and local energy barriers are included through the le4pd .",
    "because both the determination of nmr conformers and the experimental measurements of nmr relaxation are affected by errors , we performed as a further test md simulations of the same systems to evaluate the quality of agreement of the le4pd starting from the nmr and the md conformers .",
    "simulations were performed in explicit solvent using the spc / e water model .",
    "we utilized the amber99sb - ildn@xcite atomic force field for proteins and the gromacs@xcite molecular dynamics engine was utilized on the trestles supercomputer at san diego.@xcite all system conditions , e.g. temperature and salt concentration , were set to reproduce the experimental conditions .",

    "the production simulations were performed in the canonical ensemble , using a velocity rescaling thermostat.@xcite    for the pr95 protease monomer , simulations were performed starting from each of the twenty conformers in the nmr structure , resulting in a set of twenty production ensembles used as input to the le4pd , with averages taken over all twenty results .",
