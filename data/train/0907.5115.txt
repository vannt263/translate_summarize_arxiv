    "supernova neutrinos and antineutrinos ( sn @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) have long been studied as probes of both stellar and particle properties @xcite . in particular , core - collapse supernovae represent a unique laboratory for studying high - density ( anti)neutrino-(anti)neutrino interactions and their associated flavor evolution @xcite .",

    "we have verified that such vanishing is numerically realized within @xmath91  km at any grid point ; for safety , calculations are extended to @xmath92  km in all cases .      in the paper",
    "@xcite we have performed detailed three - flavor calculations for our sn model at the equipartition point for different times .",
    "the results of @xcite show that , up to small effects at the percent ( or lower ) level , the collective dynamics basically involve only two neutrino species @xmath8 , while the @xmath93 combination orthogonal to @xmath2 remains a `` spectator '' neutrino species , and similarly for antineutrinos ; see also @xcite .",
    "for instance , a typical spectral swap can be thought to occur between @xmath0 and one of the two species @xmath2 , the other being unaffected during collective evolution .",
    "the spectator species enters , however , in the later evolution at large radius via the usual @xmath94 mixing effects @xcite . by focusing our attention on the main collective effects within @xmath91  km",
    ", we can then reduce the full @xmath95 evolution to an effective @xmath19 one , namely : @xmath96 , where the relevant @xmath19 subspace ( @xmath97 ) is governed by @xmath9 . as in @xcite , we choose a default value @xmath98 we have explicitly verified , for several ( non - equipartition ) test cases in our sn scenario , that the effective @xmath19 calculations [ with @xmath71 defined as in eq .",

    "the global vectors @xmath109 and @xmath110 are defined by energy integrals analogous to @xmath101 and @xmath111 in the above equations , but with a further factor @xmath69 in the integrand @xcite .",
    "therefore , also such vectors receive positive ( negative ) contributions below ( above ) the crossing energies .",
    "the role of the crossing energies in understanding single and multiple splits has been emphasized in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig05 ] shows the qualitative spectral split patterns emerging from our numerical exploration of the ternary luminosity diagram , in the case of inverted hierarchy . in the lower half of the diagram , corresponding to relatively low @xmath2 luminosity ( @xmath112 )",
    ", we always find one @xmath6 and one @xmath7 split .",
    "more precisely , the blue triangles on the right correspond to one dominant @xmath6 split at high energy ( he ) plus a minor @xmath7 split at low energy ( le ) , qualitatively similar to fig .  [ fig01 ] ; for the yellow triangles on the left , the situation is reversed for @xmath6 and @xmath7 . as the @xmath2 luminosity increases , some @xmath113 split cases survive ( blue triangles ) , including the equipartition point . however , these cases are now flanked , on the left , by a couple of points where a double @xmath6 split occurs ( blue squares ) and , on the right , by two points with a double @xmath7 split ( yellow squares ) plus two points with a double split for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( red circles ) .",
    "therefore , a complex phenomenology of multiple splits @xcite emerges in the ternary diagram , even if restricted to the region of phenomenological interest ( the largest shaded diamond ) .",
    "in particular , small departures from luminosity equipartition can abruptly change the split patterns .    in order to better appreciate these changes ,",
    "quantitative results will be shown for representative grid points .",
    "figure  [ fig06 ] shows fifteen selected points , forming a trajectory which starts close to the equipartition case and then spirals outwards .",
    "this trajectory allows to explore the region of phenomenological interest , and to cover all the five ( qualitatively different ) single and double split patterns described in the comment to fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] .",
    "the corresponding spectra are discussed next .",
    "figures  [ fig07 ] , [ fig08 ] and [ fig09 ] show the oscillated fluxes of neutrino ( left ) and antineutrinos ( right ) per unit energy , at the end of collective effects ( @xmath114  km ) .",
    "the black and red solid curves refer to @xmath115-flavor and @xmath116-flavor , respectively ; dotted curves represent unoscillated fluxes .",
    "vertical green lines mark crossing energies , where fluxes of different flavor intersect , and flavor changes  if any  are unobservable .",
    "it is worth noticing that , in all cases , the unoscillated fluxes have qualitatively similar features , despite the large differences in relative luminosities : the @xmath2 flux is always lower ( higher ) than the @xmath0 flux , for energies below ( above ) the crossing energy @xmath17 , which ranges between 10 and 30  mev ; and similarly for antineutrinos , with @xmath117 in the range 530  mev .",
    "nevertheless , oscillated fluxes show large differences from point to point . in all panels ,",
    "we indicate the point number ( from 1 to 15 ) on the left , and the luminosity values @xmath118 on the right .    in fig .",
    "[ fig07 ] , both the 1st and the 2nd point show a split pattern very similar to the equipartition case in fig .",

    "[ fig08 ] , the 6th point shows a split pattern similar to the last one in the previous figure , namely , a double @xmath6 split and no @xmath7 split .",
    "however , in both the 7th and 8th point , a double split occurs also for @xmath7 s , although the closeness of the @xmath1 and @xmath26 spectra make it difficult to appreciate it graphically ( it will be shown in a different way below ) .",
    "the 9th and 10th point show a more evident @xmath7 double split , but no @xmath6 flavor change ( up to small upper - tail effects in the last case ) .",
    "the grid points 510 exhaust the cases where we find a double split in @xmath6 and/or @xmath7 spectra .    in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] , the cases from 11 to 13 show a pattern with a sharp he @xmath6 split and a broader le @xmath7 split , while the situation is suddenly reversed in the last two ( 14th and 15th ) cases .",
    "it should be noted that the sudden exchange of roles between @xmath6 and @xmath7 across cases 13 and 14 occurs despite the fact the unoscillated spectra and the crossing energies are very similar .    in general , the results of figs .",
    "[ fig07][fig09 ] suggest the existence of a sort of `` phase transitions '' in the ternary diagram , with abrupt changes in the split patterns when the initial luminosities cross some `` phase boundaries , '' which we shall try to identify in the next section .",

    "all double splits flank the crossing energy ( vertical green line ) , in agreement with the arguments of @xcite .",
    "as also noted in @xcite , the values of @xmath119 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 coincide at high @xmath80 ( i.e. , for @xmath120 ) .",
    "a double - double split is evident only in cases 7 and 8 . in cases 5 and 10 , instead , there seems to be a partly developed `` would - be double split '' for @xmath7 and @xmath6 , respectively . in the spirit of @xcite , it is tempting to attribute the suppression of such emerging splits to the relatively high ( thus unfavorable @xcite ) values of the associated crossing energies ; however , this argument is insufficient to explain the total absence of @xmath7 and @xmath6 double splits in cases 6 and 9 , where the associated crossing energies are favorably lower . in the next sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we shall develop different arguments , trying to relate ( at least some of ) such spectral features to global initial conditions and potential energy minimization .",
    "additional comments will be provided in sec .",
    "the authors of @xcite propose a very interesting attempt to explain analytically the development and the stabilization of spectral splits in terms of adiabatic invariants , energy minimization , and localization of the crossing energies ( with details to appear in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "here we aim at providing another viewpoint on the interpretation of single and double spectral splits , with emphasis on the initial orientation of the global polarization vectors and on some non - adiabatic features .",
    "initially , the global polarization vectors @xmath101 , @xmath111 and @xmath106 are oriented along the @xmath121 axis .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] displays the curves ( straight lines in our sn model ) where @xmath122 ( green ) , @xmath123 ( blue ) and @xmath124 ( violet ) at the neutrinosphere , superposed to the same marked grid of points of fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] .",
    "we surmise that sign changes of @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath105 across these lines mark `` phase transitions '' across different split patterns in the ternary diagram , as argued below for the various cases reproduced from fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] ( blue and yellow triangles and squares , red circles ) .",
    "these cases , which include the equipartition one , are characterized by @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 . in other words , both @xmath101 and the smaller vector @xmath102 are initially aligned upwards , in the unstable pendulum position @xcite . as already argued in @xcite",
    ", the flavor pendulum dynamics would bring both vectors downwards , but is impeded by conservation of @xmath105 ; the simplest way to minimize the potential energy is then to invert the vector @xmath131 and an equivalent fraction of the vector @xmath101 , leading to a sharply defined `` high - energy '' neutrino split ( whose development can be described by detailed adiabatic constructions @xcite ) .",
    "however , the `` low - energy '' antineutrino split seem to have a different , nonadiabatic origin , as already argued in @xcite and suggested by its broader features . in the present work ( where the effects of the matter potential @xmath83 are ignored ) , we find that the @xmath7 modes below the split energy @xmath132 basically experience a usual `` resonant transition '' when @xmath133 , and then decouple from the collective dynamics . in the energy range considered ( @xmath134  mev ) , this resonance is highly nonadiabatic , and leads to a two - level hopping probability @xmath135 , corresponding to @xmath136 .",
    "[ we have explicitly verified the expected decrease of @xmath137 and @xmath119 at lower energies , as well as their dependence on the @xmath138 profile . ] in other words , the low - energy neutrino modes resonate with the interaction potential , and do not participate in later collective swaps .",
    "we find that this phenomenon roughly takes place during ( and a little bit after ) the so - called period of synchronized oscillations @xcite ( which is then followed by `` bipolar '' oscillations @xcite ) . defining @xmath139 as the value of @xmath84 at the transition from synchronized to bipolar oscillations @xcite , the antineutrino energy modes which remain pinned upwards are roughly determined by the condition @xmath140 . in our numerical experiments , such condition identifies the antineutrino split energies within a factor of about 23 ; in particular , we find that the highest values of such energies are reached for the grid points closest to the @xmath124 line .",
    "these cases are similar to the previous one , but the roles of @xmath6 and @xmath142 are exchanged , since @xmath143 and thus @xmath144 is larger than @xmath125 . the dominant he split , dictated by @xmath105-conservation , occurs for antineutrinos .",
    "the inversion of low - energy neutrino modes appears to be impeded by early nonadiabatic resonances for @xmath145 .      in these two cases ( identified as n.  5 and 6 in figs .",
    "[ fig06 ] and [ fig10 ] ) , @xmath101 is oriented upwards , in the unstable position , while @xmath102 is oriented downwards and is thus already stable .",
    "however , the vector @xmath101 can not be inverted , even partially ( i.e. , with a single split ) , due to @xmath105 conservation : the two vectors are `` locked '' and remain basically equal in modulus and orientation at the end of collective effects , as we have explicitly verified . however , one can still invert a fraction of the neutrino spectra `` symmetrically '' with respect to @xmath17 @xcite , so as to preserve the modulus of @xmath101 while decreasing the value of @xmath146 ( and thus the potential energy ) .",
    "the double neutrino split appears thus a highly constrained way to lower the energy of the system , when the global polarization vectors of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are basically locked .",
    "finally , we note that the point identified as n.  5 in figs .",
    "[ fig06 ] and [ fig10 ] represents a `` borderline '' case , being almost on top of the line at @xmath122 .",
    "this specific feature might be at the origin of the partial `` double split , '' barely emerging in the antineutrino spectrum for this case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "these two cases ( numbered as points n.  9 and 10 in figs .",
    "[ fig06 ] and [ fig10 ] ) are analogous to the previous ones ( n.  6 and 5 , respectively ) , but the role of @xmath6 and @xmath7 is exchanged .",
    "so , the same considerations apply , including the `` borderline '' features of point 10 which sits on top of the @xmath123 line .    a third case ( numbered as point n.  8 in figs",
    ".  [ fig06 ] and [ fig10 ] ) should also fall in the same category , being characterized by the same initial signs of the global polarization vectors .",
    "however , for this point ( the lowest red circle in fig .  [ fig11 ] )",
    "we find double splits for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "we have been unable to explain this `` exception '' by sharpening energy minimization arguments .",
    "see , however , sec .",
    "[ sec7 ] for further comments .",
    "these cases include the mentioned point n.  8 ( which escapes a simple explanation ) and point n.  7 ( the highest red circle in fig .  [ fig11 ] ) , which can be instead more easily interpreted .",
    "the latter point is the only one , in our grid , having both @xmath101 and @xmath111 initially oriented downward , in the stable pendulum position .",
    "then , the only way to further minimize the potential energy ( without altering @xmath105 ) is to generate double splits which preserve the moduli of @xmath101 and @xmath111 while decreasing the values of @xmath146 and @xmath149 , which is indeed what happens at the end of the collective evolution ( see fig .  [ fig10 ] ) .      in inverted hierarchy , both single and double splits may appear in either the @xmath6 or the @xmath7 spectra , depending on the initial distribution of the total luminosity over the species ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "the split patterns observed numerically admit ( with one exception ) a relatively simple interpretation in terms of initial conditions for the global polarization vectors @xmath101 , @xmath111 and @xmath106 , supplemented by arguments related to the flavor pendulum dynamics and its potential energy minimization .",
    "transitions to different split patterns emerge when crossing the lines @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 in the ternary luminosity diagram .",
    "in normal hierarchy , the flavor pendulum dynamics is generally trivial , since the initial conditions are typically very close to the stable equilibrium position @xcite .",
    "however , an interesting counterexample has been provided in @xcite for a situation with relatively large @xmath2 luminosity .    in our ternary diagram , we find that collective effects produce no flavor change in normal hierarchy , except for a single grid point  the one with the highest @xmath2 luminosity . in this peculiar case ,",
    "both @xmath101 and @xmath111 start in the unstable position ( now corresponding to downward orientation ) , and then partially reverse , in order to minimize energy while preserving @xmath105 . as a result ,",
    "single splits emerge in both @xmath6 and @xmath7 spectra , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , in qualitative agreement with the normal - hierarchy case discussed in @xcite .",
    "in sec .  [ sec5 ] , the proposed interpretation of the double split patterns emerging in fig .  [ fig10 ] shows that initially stable ( downward - aligned ) global polarization vectors may be ( cases 7 , 8) or may not be ( cases 5 , 6 , and 9 , 10 ) further stabilized by a double split . in view of the results in @xcite , it is worthwhile to investigate if the absence of some `` would - be double splits '' can be related to incomplete adiabaticity . to this purpose , we examine a hypothetical scenario , where the function @xmath71 is radially stretched by a factor of ten above the neutrinosphere , @xmath151    the main results for such `` more adiabatic '' scenario are summarized in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig14 ] shows the resulting , `` adiabatic '' spectral split patterns , to be compared with the ones in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "it appears that there are at least three distinct `` phases '' in the ternary diagram , with either single splits ( at low / high or high / low energy ) or double splits in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 spectra . within the @xmath148 region of fig .",

    "the equipartition case is close to the crossing point of the three curves in figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] and [ fig14 ] .",
    "therefore , in the inverted hierarchy case , relatively small variations in the fractional luminosities , or in the ( non)adiabatic character of the neutrino evolution , may induce significant variations in the observable spectral split patterns .    concerning the normal hierarchy case , we do not find qualitatively new features by using the modified function @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ adiab ] ) , as compared with the discussion in sec .",
    "in core - collapse supernovae , collective effects involving high - density ( anti)neutrinos continues to reveal surprising features . in particular , relatively small variations of the luminosities associated to @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 appear to trigger abrupt changes from single- to double - split features in the energy spectra .",
    "we have investigated the effect of generic variations of the fractional luminosities @xmath153 with respect to the usual `` energy equipartition '' case @xmath154 , within an early - time supernova scenario with fixed thermal spectra and total luminosity . the constraint",
    "@xmath5 has been embedded in a `` ternary luminosity diagram , '' which has been numerically explored over an evenly - spaced grid of points .    in inverted hierarchy ,",
    "we have found both single- and double - split cases for either neutrino or antineutrino spectra , and have proposed an interpretation of these patterns in terms of initial orientations of the global flavor polarization vectors @xmath101 and @xmath111 , and of minimization of the potential energy , constrained by lepton number conservation ( @xmath155 ) . in particular , the curves defined by @xmath122 , @xmath156 and @xmath124 appear to provide `` phase transition boundaries '' between regions with single- and double - split features .",
    "the regions where at least one double split occurs ( for either @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) can actually merge into a single one with @xmath148 splits , if adiabaticity is increased by design .",
    "it turns out that the luminosity equipartition point is relatively close to the crossing point of the three separation curves ; therefore , relatively small variations of the fractional luminosities can produce qualitatively different swaps and quantitatively significant changes in the final spectra , at the end of the collective favor evolution .    on one hand , these results may provide a handle to reconstruct the original luminosities @xmath153 , if the associated spectral split patterns can be observed in future galactic sn explosions . on the other hand ,",
    "they complicate the calculation of the diffuse supernova neutrino background , since past sn events may well have different relative luminosities and thus different spectral split features . even within a single core - collapse sn event , there might be transitions from single- to double - split spectra ( or viceversa ) during the first few seconds after bounce , as a results of time - dependent changes in the relative luminosities , average energies , ( non)adiabatic features , and possible departures from thermal spectra .",
    "the analysis of this rich phenomenology is just at the beginning , and calls for a deeper theoretical interpretations and for more refined numerical explorations , in order to get the most from observable supernova neutrino events . concerning the results presented in this work , we plan to refine them by focusing on the phenomenologically interesting region close to the equipartition point , where further insights on the spectral split patterns may be expected , in both normal and inverted hierarchy , by adopting a more general sn framework and a denser sampling grid .",
