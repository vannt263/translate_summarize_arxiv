    "[ 3 ] , we give some consequences of the section [ 2 ] as characterizations of other graph families related to complete colorings .",
    "we will use the following chordal graph characterization to prove theorem [ teo1 ] :    [ hajnal , sur ' anyi @xcite and dirac @xcite ] [ teo0 ] a graph @xmath2 is chordal if and only if @xmath2 can be obtained by identifying two complete subgraphs of the same order in two chordal graphs .",
    "now , we characterize the chordal graphs and the @xmath35-perfect ones . the following proof is based on the standard proof of the chordal graph perfection ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ teo1 ] a graph @xmath2 is @xmath35-perfect if and only if @xmath2 is chordal .",
    "assume that @xmath2 is @xmath35-perfect .",
    "note that if a cycle @xmath0 is one of four or more vertices then @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "hence , every induced cycle of @xmath2 has at the most @xmath38 vertices and the implication is true .",
    "now , we verify the converse . since every induced subgraph of a chordal graph is also a chordal graph , it suffices to show that if @xmath2 is a connected chordal graph , then @xmath39 . we proceed by induction on the order @xmath40 of @xmath2 . if @xmath41 , then @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "assume , therefore , that @xmath44 for every induced chordal graph @xmath0 of order less than @xmath40 for @xmath45 and let @xmath2 be a chordal graph of order @xmath40 . if @xmath2 is a complete graph , then @xmath46 .",
    "hence , we may assume that @xmath2 is not complete .",
    "by theorem [ teo0 ] , @xmath2 can be obtained from two chordal graphs @xmath29 and @xmath30 by identifying two complete subgraphs of the same order in @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the set of vertices in @xmath2 that belong to @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "thus the induced subgraph @xmath48 in @xmath2 by @xmath47 is complete and no vertex in @xmath49 is adjacent to a vertex in @xmath50 .",
    "hence , @xmath51 moreover , according to the induction hypothesis , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , then @xmath54 on the other hand , since @xmath47 is a clique cut then each walk between @xmath49 and @xmath50 contains at least one vertex in @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a pseudo - connected @xmath13-coloring of @xmath2 , and suppose there exist two color classes such that one is completely contained in @xmath49 , and the other one is completely contained in @xmath50 .",
    "clearly these two color classes do not intersect , which contradicts our choice of @xmath4",
    ". moreover , each color class with vertices both in @xmath49 and in @xmath50 , contains vertices in @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , every pair of color classes having vertices both in @xmath49 and in @xmath50 must have an incidence in @xmath55 .",
    "thus , @xmath56 by equation [ des1 ] , @xmath57 and the result follows .",
    "it is known that every chordal graph is a @xmath33-perfect one ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the following corollary is a consequence of the chordal graph perfection .",
    "every @xmath35-perfect graph is @xmath33-perfect .",
    "in this section , we give a new characterization of several family of @xmath24-perfect graphs related to complete colorings .",
    "complete bipartite graphs have achromatic number two ( see @xcite ) but their hadwiger number can be arbitrarily large , while the graph formed by the union of @xmath62 has hadwiger number two but its achromatic number can be arbitrarily large . therefore , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are two non comparable parameters .",
    "we will use the following characterization in the proof of corollary [ cor1 ] .                        on one hand , a coloring such that every color class contains a vertex that has a neighbor in every other color class is called _ dominating_. the _",

    "@xmath72 of a graph @xmath2 is the largest integer @xmath3 such that @xmath2 admits a dominating @xmath3-coloring .",
    "[ cor3 ] for any graph @xmath23 the following are equivalent : @xmath75 @xmath2 is @xmath65-perfect , @xmath76 @xmath2 is @xmath77-perfect , @xmath78 @xmath2 is @xmath79-perfect and @xmath80 @xmath2 is @xmath81-free",
    ".    the proofs of @xmath82 and @xmath83 immediately follow from ( [ des5 ] ) . to prove @xmath84 note that , if @xmath85 then @xmath86",
    ", hence the implication is true , see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the proof of @xmath87 is a consequence of theorem [ teo2 ] .",
    "first , a coloring of @xmath2 is called _ pseudo - grundy _ if each vertex is adjacent to some vertex of each smaller color . the _ pseudo - grundy number _",
    "@xmath91 is the maximum @xmath3 for which a pseudo - grundy @xmath3-coloring of @xmath2 exists ( see @xcite ) .",
    "second , a proper pseudo - grundy coloring of @xmath2 is called _ grundy_. the _ grundy number _ @xmath92 ( also known as the _ first - fit chromatic number _ ) is the maximum @xmath3 for which a grundy @xmath3-coloring of @xmath2 exists ( see @xcite ) . from the definitions , we have that                for the converse , let @xmath2 be a @xmath94-perfect graph . if @xmath0 is an induced graph of @xmath2 , by equation [ des4 ] , @xmath100 . since @xmath2 is a chordal graph , @xmath44",
