    "one of the central results in the rapidly developing field of quantum information theory is the possibility of perfectly transferring an unknown quantum state from a target system at the sender s location , a , to another identical system at the receiver s location , b. this is called teleportation and requires that the sender and receiver share a maximally entangled state , and further , that they can communicate via a classical channel .",
    "the original proposal of bennett et al@xcite was posed in terms of systems with a two dimensional hilbert space ( qubits@xcite ) .",
    "however recently furasawa et al.@xcite , using a proposal of braunstein and kimble@xcite , have demonstrated that the method can also be applied to entangled systems with an infinite dimensional hilbert space , specifically for harmonic oscillator states . in that work ,",
    "a coherent state was teleported using an entanglement resource that consisted of a two mode squeezed vacuum state .",
    "the joint measurements required for teleportation are joint quadrature phase on the target system and that part of the entangled resource shared by the receiver .",
    "the essential feature exploited in the scheme of furasawa et al is the well know fact that a two mode squeezed vacuum state is an approximation to an epr ( einstein - podolsky - rosen ) state , which had previously been shown by vaidman@xcite to enable teleportation of continuous observables .",
    "however a squeezed vacuum state is also ( imperfectly ) entangled in number and phase .",
    "can this entanglement be used as a teleportation resource as well ?    in this paper",
    "we show that by making joint number and phase measurements this entanglement can also be used for teleportation .",
    "however because the number operator is bounded from below , there are limits on the ability to teleport a quantum state by this protocol .",
    "suppose that at some prior time a two mode squeezed vacuum state is generated and that one mode is open to local operations and measurements at the sender s location a by observer alice , while the other mode is open to local operations and measurements in the receiver s location b , by observer bob .",
    "alice and bob can communicate via a classical communication channel .",
    "thus alice and bob each have access to one of the two entangled sub systems described by @xmath0 this state is generated from the vacuum state by the unitary transformation @xmath1 where @xmath2 and where @xmath3 refer to the mode accessible to alice and the mode accessible to bob respectively .",
    "the entanglement of this state can be viewed in two ways .",
    "firstly as an entanglement between quadrature phases in the two modes ( epr entanglement ) and secondly as an entanglement between number and phase in the two modes . we can easily show that this state approximates the entanglement of an epr state in the limit @xmath4 or @xmath5 . the quadrature phase entanglement is easily seen by calculating the effect of the squeezing transformation eq([transform ] ) in the heisenberg picture .",
    "we first define the quadrature phase operators for the two modes @xmath6 then @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the variance .",
    "thus in the limit of @xmath5 the state @xmath9 approaches a simultaneous eigenstate of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is the analogue of the epr state with position replaced by the real quadratures @xmath12 and the momentum replaced by the imaginary quadratures , @xmath13 .",
    "this state is also entangled with respect to the correlation specified by the statement : _ an equal number of photons in each mode_. however it is not a perfectly entangled state , which would require the ( unphysical ) case of a uniform distribution over correlated states .",
    "it can approach a perfectly entangled state of photon number asymptotically in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "the reduced density operator of each mode is a thermal - like state with mean photon number @xmath14 and thus the limit of a perfectly entangled state can only occur as the mean photon number goes to infinity , which is not physical . for finite excitation ,",
    "the distribution of correlated states is very close to uniform for values @xmath15 .",
    "this suggests that in practice this state can be used as a perfectly entangled state of photon number provided all other states available have significant support on the photon number basis up to a maximum value of @xmath16 .",
    "we now show that this is indeed true if this state is used as a teleportation resource .    in the case of number and phase , it is obvious that the squeezed vacuum state is the zero eigenstate of the number difference operator @xmath17 not so obvious is the fact that as @xmath4 , the two modes become anti correlated in phase . to see this",
    "we compute the canonical joint phase distribution for the two modes using the projection operator valued measure @xmath18 normalised on @xmath19 $ ] with respect to the measure @xmath20 .",
    "the joint distribution is @xmath21 as @xmath4 this distribution becomes very sharply peaked at @xmath22 .",
    "thus the photon number in each mode are perfectly correlated while the phase in each mode is highly anti correlated .",
    "we first show how teleportation of continuous variables is possible using a perfect quadrature phase qnd ( quantum nondemolition ) measurement between two optical modes , a and b , to create the entanglement resource .",
    "the state that is produced is an optical analogue of the epr state discussed by vaidman@xcite .",
    "our presentation is completely equivalent to that given by vaidman , however we will use more conventional quantum optics notation .    consider the following entangled state of two modes a and b , @xmath23 where the quadrature phase operators , @xmath24 are defined in eq([qp ] ) and the states appearing in this equation are the quadrature phase eigenstates , @xmath25 one then easily verifies that the state defined in eq([epr ] ) is a simultaneous eigenstate of @xmath26 and @xmath27 with respective eigenvlaues , @xmath28 . the unitary transformation in eq([epr ] )",
    "is generated by the perfect qnd hamiltonian @xmath29 , which realises a qnd coupling between modes a and b. it is also the prototype measurement coupling hamiltonian first defined by von neumann .",
    "it is important to realise that all perfect qnd couplings are a source of entanglement and a potential resource for teleportation .",
    "needless to say this state is not a physical state , not because the qnd interaction can not be achieved , but because the quadrature phase eigenstates appearing in eq([epr ] ) are infinite energy states .",
    "however we can use arbitrary close approximations to these states given a sufficient energy resource , as in the case of a squeezed vacuum state discussed below .    in the protocol for teleportation based on this state",
    ", we now consider another mode , the target mode t , in an unknown state @xmath30 .",
    "joint quadrature phase measurements of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are made on modes t and a , yielding two real numbers , @xmath33 respectively .",
    "the total input state for the teleportation protocol is @xmath34 the ( unnormalised ) conditional state of the total system after the measurement on a and t is given by the projection @xmath35 using the eq([epr ] ) we may write then write the conditional state of mode b as @xmath36^{-1/2}\\hat{\\phi}(x_2,y_2)|y_1\\rangle_b\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the probability for the results @xmath38 .",
    "the state @xmath39 is an eigenstate of @xmath40 with eigenvalue @xmath41 , which is determined by the initial choice of entangled state for a and b. the operator @xmath42 , acts only on mode b and is defined by @xmath43 using the definition of the state @xmath44 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 , it is possible to show that @xmath48 thus up to a phase factor and two simple unitary transformations , the conditional state of b is the same as the initial unknown state of the target t. if a now sends the results of the measurements @xmath38 to the receiver , b , the phase factor and two unitary transformations can be removed by local operations that correspond to a displacement in phase space by @xmath49 in the real quadrature direction and @xmath50 in the imaginary quadrature direction . the initial state of t has then been teleported to mode b at a distant location .      in the introduction",
    "we noted that the squeezed vacuum state @xmath51 is an approximation to the quadrature epr state discussed in the previous section . in the limit of infinite squeezing , this state becomes equivalent to the epr state .",
    "we now show that the two - mode squeezed vacuum state can be used for teleportation with fidelity that approaches unity as the squeezing increases to infinity .    we again assume perfect projective measurements of the joint quadrature phase quantities , @xmath31 and @xmath27 on the target sate and the senders part of the entangled mode , a , with the results @xmath52 respectively .",
    "the ( unnormalised ) conditional state of total system after the measurement is then seen to be given by @xmath53it is then easy to show that the state of mode b at the receiver is the pure state @xmath54 with the wave function ( in the @xmath55 representation ) , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the wavefunction for the target state we seek to teleport .",
    "the kernel is given by @xmath58\\ ] ]    this state is clearly not the same as the state we sought to teleport .",
    "however in the limit of infinite squeezing , @xmath5 , we find that @xmath59 and the state of mode b approaches @xmath60 which , up to the expected unitary translations in phase - space , is the required teleported state .      in this section",
    "we explore to what extent teleportation is possible using the number phase entanglement implicit in the squeezed vacuum state . in this case",
    "we expand the target state in the photon number basis as @xmath61 thus the input state to the receiver and sender is @xmath62 to facilitate the description of the joint measurements that need to be made on t and a modes at the receiver , we define the eigenstates of the operator @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the number operators for modes t and a respectively . these eigenstates can be written as pseudo angular momentum states as @xmath65 where the eigenvlaue @xmath66 of @xmath67 is determined by the result @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the total photon number operator for modes @xmath70 and @xmath71 with eigenvlaue @xmath72 . in that case @xmath73 . the relationship between the state eq.([angmom ] ) and the original product number basis is @xmath74 the combined state of the entire system may now be written @xmath75 note that in this equation the sum over @xmath76 is over half integers as well as integers .",
    "the teleportation protocol for number and phase requires that alice make two measurements of a joint quantity on a and t. in this case the first measurement will seek to determine one half the photon number difference as represented by @xmath77 , while the second measurement will seek to determine the phase sum of the two modes . for the first measurements the possible results are @xmath78 .",
    "consider first the case of @xmath79 .",
    "the conditional ( unnormalised ) state of the entire system is @xmath80 where we have returned to the product number basis in preparation for the next measurement of phase sum .",
    "if the measurement result was negative @xmath81 , the conditional unnormalised state is @xmath82    the _ second _ measurement is a measurement of the joint total phase operator for modes @xmath70 and @xmath71 , defined by the projection operator valued measure @xmath83 now , it must be said at once that such measurements are unphysical , however they do represent the limit of perfectly valid ( though rather impractical ) discrete phase measurements@xcite . as a result of this measurement , alice has a value @xmath84 for the phase .",
    "the corresponding conditional state of mode b , given a positive number difference measurement is @xmath85 while if a negative number difference result were obtained the state of mode b is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is in fact the probability for alice to obtain the result @xmath88 .",
    "this is given by @xmath89 with @xmath88 taken as positive in both equations .",
    "now it only remains for alice to communicate to bob what value she got for the two measurements , that is the values @xmath88 and @xmath84 , and for bob to find the appropriate conditional unitary transformations to reconstruct the state .",
    "the phase displacement part is quite straightforward .",
    "the receiver , b , applies the local unitary transformation @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number operator for the mode b. after this transformation the states become , @xmath92 in both cases .",
    "naively one might think that we can now apply a number displacement operator , either up or down by @xmath93 , to reconstruct the state in an analogous fashion to the case of quadrature teleportation .",
    "while formally we can construct such an operator ( see below ) , there is going to be a problem with the case @xmath79 , as all the coefficients for photon number less than @xmath93 will be missing !",
    "this result is directly attributable to the fact that the spectrum of the number operator is bounded below by zero .",
    "we must accept this as a limit to teleportation when number phase measurements are used and keep this in mind when trying to find more general teleportation schemes in the future .",
    "what is the number displacement operator ?",
    "the generator of displacements for number must be the canonical phase .",
    "formally this is defined by @xmath94 where @xmath95 the fact that these basis states are not normalisable indicates that it is impossible in practice to realise a true number displacement operator .",
    "however there are schemes that can reproduce arbitrarily well a number displacement@xcite .",
    "we first consider the example of the target state prepared in the number state @xmath96 . in this case",
    "the probability to obtain a result @xmath97 for the measurement of the photon number difference operator @xmath98 on a and t is @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "the most probable result is @xmath101 , in which case the teleported state is the vacuum state @xmath102 which , given the data @xmath101 may be displaced back to @xmath103 , _ independent of the value of _ @xmath104 .",
    "indeed it is easy to see that we can teleport a number state perfectly regardless of the value of @xmath104 provided that we can make number displacements .",
    "this is in contrast to the quadrature case where fidelity does depend on @xmath104 .",
    "this is a consequence of the perfect correlation between photon number for each mode in the squeezed vacuum state .",
    "however the probabilities for different values of the photon number difference in a and t do depend on the value of @xmath104 .",
    "next consider the case of a coherent state @xmath105 .",
    "this state has a poisson photon number distribution with a mean of @xmath106 .",
    "the probability to observe a photon number difference @xmath97 between the target and the sender mode , a , is @xmath107 where @xmath108 is an integer .",
    "this distribution is shown in figure [ figone ] , with @xmath109 .",
    "note that the distribution is relatively flat around @xmath110 , that is around equal photon numbers in both a and t. it is easy to see that when @xmath4 , the rapid fall off occurs for values @xmath111 .",
    "this is not too surprising as the most likely photon number in mode t is just @xmath112 and thus this is the largest possible value for the photon number difference between modes a and t. however the minimum value for @xmath97 ( which is negative ) as determined by the largest photon number in mode a , which as @xmath113 can be a large negative number . for this reason",
    "the distribution is highly asymmetric and falls off quite slowly for @xmath114 .",
    "one performance measure for teleportation is the fidelity between the target state for mode b and the actual state teleported .",
    "we will calculate the fidelity for the transported state after the appropriate number displacement operator has acted .",
    "this is defined by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the teleported and displaced state at the receiver , b , given a photon number difference measurement result , @xmath97 , at the sender , a and t. the fidelity is given by @xmath117 & m<0 \\end{array}\\right .\\ ] ] the fidelity is plotted in figure [ figtwo ] for @xmath118 and two values of @xmath104 .",
    "we see that for @xmath119 the fidelity is very close to unity until there is a chance of obtaining a positive photon number difference which exceeds the average photon number in the target state we wish to teleport .",
    "however we see from figure [ figone ] that this is likely to happen with rapidly decreasing probability .",
    "given the current difficulty of realising a photon number displacement operator it is of interest to determine the fidelity when no attempt is made to displace the final state .",
    "if we assume that the target state is a coherent state with amplitude @xmath120 , the fidelity when the results of the photon number difference measurement is zero , @xmath110 , is @xmath121 if we note that the mean photon number in the entanglement resource shared between a and b is just that for a squeezed vacuum state , @xmath122 , we may write the fidelity as @xmath123 this indicates that when the mean photon number in the entanglement resource is significantly greater than that in the target state , the teleportation is high fidelity . indeed in the limit that @xmath4",
    ", the teleportation for a result @xmath110 is perfect .",
    "of course the fidelity falls off if @xmath124 unless we act with the number displacement operator to shift the received state .",
    "if we do not ( or possibly can not ) do that the fidelity falls of in a gaussian like fashion , which for @xmath125 has a width that scales like half the mean photon number in the target state , @xmath126 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ figthree ] .",
    "we have shown how the imperfect entanglement of a two - mode squeezed vacuum state can be used for teleportation of an unknown quantum state for two different measurement protocols at the sender .",
    "one protocol is based on quadrature phase measurements and is suggested by the fact that a squeezed vacuum state is an approximation to an epr correlated state for quadrature phase amplitude variables . however a squeezed vacuum state is also entangled with respect to photon number difference and phase sum in the two modes .",
    "this suggests a protocol based on number and phase measurements at the sender .",
    "while such measurements are just beyond the reach of current experiments in quantum options , our examples suggest that a given entanglement resource admits more than one teleportation protocol . in the case of a squeezed vacuum state",
    "the quadrature phase protocol is simpler based on current technology .",
    "however this may not be true for other entanglement resources , or other realisations of the entanglement .",
    "in fact any perfect qnd interaction between two systems is a potential entanglement resource and determining the best teleportation protocol may be a non trivial exercise .",
