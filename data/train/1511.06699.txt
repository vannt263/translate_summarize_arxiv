    "according to the mood disorder society of canada ( mdsc ) , _ mental health _ and _ mental illness _ is defined as follows :    * * mental health : * + _ ( or well - being ) is an ideal we all strive for .",
    "it is a balance of mental , emotional , physical and spiritual health .",
    "caring relationships , a place to call home , a supportive community , and work and leisure all contribute to mental health . however , no one s life is perfect , so mental health is also about learning the coping skills to deal with life s ups and downs the best we can . _ * * mental illness : * + _ is a serious disturbance in thoughts , feelings and perceptions that is severe enough to affect day - to - day functioning _ @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper , i will instead be using the term _ poor mental health _ rather than _ mental illness _ to avoid the negative association with the term ` illness . '",
    "some specific types of poor mental health that one typically hears about are for instance : schizophrenia , depression , bi - polar disorder , anxiety disorders , eating disorders , borderline personality disorder , autism - spectrum disorder , post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) , etc . @xcite .",
    "why such forms of poor mental health develop depends on many factors such as genetics and one s environment , but this is an over simplification of the issue @xcite .",
    "the issue is highly individual , and globally complex as a result .",
    "researchers still know very little about poor mental health and the relation between one s environment and gene expression .",
    "it is a topic that is slowly starting to be taken more seriously , especially given recent media coverage which describes poor mental health as an increasing pandemic @xcite . nonetheless , there is still significant and substantial stigma , and naive notions when it come to mental health .",
    "the younger generations are especially vulnerable to poor mental health . according to the mdcs , 18@xmath0 of canadians alone between the ages of 15 - 24",
    "are reported to have poor mental health or substance abuse problems . sadly , suicide accounts for 24@xmath0 of all deaths among canadians aged 15 - 24 , and 16@xmath0 of all deaths for the age group 25 - 44 .",
    "the people with the highest rate of depression are people under the age of 20 ; and people between the ages of 20 - 29 have the highest rate of anxiety @xcite .",
    "this is a major problem , especially if we want to have a functional , altruistic society in the future .",
    "this is the generation that we expect will be solving some , if not all , of the world s most difficult problems .",
    "issues such as climate change , population growth and population sustainability , economic inequality ( perhaps even the collapse of the monetary system ) , the impact of integration of automation technologies and robots into everyday society , and so on @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in order to solve these problems , people need to be scientifically literate and mathematically competent and proficient . in general ,",
    "modern functioning society is highly dependent on technology ; particularly on science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( stem ) educated individuals . with the high probability of most repetitive jobs vanishing due to technological developments in automation @xcite - stem education and training will be essential and necessary for twenty - first century careers . to learn such material",
    "requires a lot of intense , focused and consistent work . to complete such work , stable and reliable",
    "mental health must exist .",
    "this implies an individual s mental health is just as important as physical health for such intense learning to take place .",
    "hence , it is essential that we address poor mental health .",
    "this is particularly important for our young people who grew up with the internet due to their increased physical isolation relative to previous generations .",
    "unfortunately , very little research has been done on the impact of mental stability and the development of young adults learning capacities and motivations .    as a young mathematics instructor at a post - secondary institution ,",
    "the university of waterloo in canada , mental health became a major concern of mine , consuming substantial time .",
    "the longer i teach these young people , the more i see their struggle in learning due to poor mental health @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , most of the time the problem is not recognized or taken seriously .",
    "observing this first hands motivated me to write this paper to help the well - being of my students .",
    "the focus will be to present supporting evidence that a shift in the primary and post - secondary education systems culture is needed to be :    * more aware of mental health , * aware of how poor mental health affects the learning process , and * aware of how an institution s awareness affects their students .",
    "in order to gain more perspective and information on the mental health and opinions of my students , i created several surveys for them to complete if so desired . at the start of the fall 2014 term at the university of waterloo",
    ", i made the surveys available to the students i had taught in the previous terms , and the students i was teaching at the time .",
    "more specifically , i prepared these surveys using google forms for the mathematics students at the university of waterloo .",
    "this included students in the undeclared math program ( first and second year students ) , as well as students in the applied math , pure math , statistics , combinatorics and optimization , mathematical physics , and double degree math - business programs .",
    "the students who completed these surveys did so out of voluntary compliance ; it was not part of any class and the students were informed the results would be summarized in a paper . although i was skeptical that anyone would complete them , to my surprise , many students were willing and enthusiastic about completing ( and helping create ) the surveys .",
    "this demonstrated to me that the students wanted their opinions to be known ; they just required an appropriate outlet .    for the survey results shown below , the total number of students who answered ` yes ' or ` no ' is given .",
    "the number of students who did not answer ` yes ' or ` no ' but rather left a comment , is not included in the mentioned numerical values . however , some of these comments can be found in appendix b.",
    "the purpose of the initial surveys was to determine the students views on mental health and how the university setting influences their mental well - being .",
    "the following results were obtained :    * 82@xmath0 of 238 students said : _ the professor i have for a class influences how much i work in that class . _ * 88@xmath0 of 236 students said : _",
    "i am more motivated in class if i like the professor . _ * 66@xmath0 of 227 students said : _ a professor s awareness on mental health influences my enjoyment in a class . _ * 95@xmath0 of 234 students said : _",
    "professor s should be aware of mental health . _",
    "* 84@xmath0 of 221 students said : _",
    "discussions on mental health are important . _ * 77@xmath0 of 215 students said : _",
    "i believe i am aware of my own mental health . _",
    "* 77@xmath0 of 212 students said : _",
    "i believe that my peers and i are not aware of each other s mental health . _ * 65@xmath0 of 136 students said : _ we did not have discussions on mental health in high school . _ 40 % of the remaining students ( 35@xmath0 of 136 students ) who said :",
    "_ we did have discussion on mental health in high school _ , also said : _ i do not think the school did a good job .",
    "_ * 88@xmath0 of 102 students said : _",
    "professors should be able to take mental health into consideration . _ * 61@xmath0 of 102 students said : _ mental health has not been addressed thoroughly at university . _ * 72@xmath0 of 107 students said : _ i think professors should have training on mental health .",
    "_ * 48@xmath0 of 167 students said : _ i think that the professors at the university of waterloo are not aware of mental health .",
    "_    the following questions were also asked on the student surveys :    * q1 : are there any departments at the university that you feel are less aware of mental health ?",
    "* q2 : do you think poor mental health will become a larger issue in society as time progresses ?",
    "* q3 : has the university affected your mental health ? * q4 : do you think mental health is compromising your success in classes ?",
    "fifty - two students responded to q1 , 58 responded to q2 , 83 answered q3 and 102 answered q4 .",
    "the distribution of student responses to q1 can be seen in fig .",
    "it can be seen that 52@xmath0 of students said the mathematics department in particular was not very aware of the students mental health .",
    "engineering was the second highest ranked department at 17@xmath0 .",
    "[ ht ]     [ ht ]     the distribution of student responses to q2 , q3 and q4 can be seen in the top , middle and bottom plot of fig .",
    "2 , respectively .",
    "it was found that 81@xmath0 of students thought that poor mental health will become a larger issue in society as time naturally progresses .",
    "this is a hypothesis of mine , and my conjecture is that poor mental health is related to the larger amounts of information that everyone is exposed to on a regular basis . consider that within a single minute , more information is uploaded onto the internet than a person 200 year ago was exposed to in their entire lifetime @xcite .",
    "such volumes of information will have some of influence on our minds and consciousness .",
    "humanity has progressed this far due to natural selection and thus , how our physical bodies have evolved .",
    "surely our minds and consciousness will evolve as our environment changes with respect to time .",
    "therefore , i hypothesize that ` mental illness ' is an evolution of our minds responding to the volume of information exposed to us .    in the middle plot of fig .",
    "2 , one can see that 44@xmath0 of students surveyed think the university has influenced their mental health in a negative way ; whereas 35@xmath0 say the university has influenced their mental health in a positive way . unfortunately , as depicted in the bottom plot of fig .",
    "2 , 46@xmath0 of the students surveyed think their success in the classroom is being compromised because of their mental health .",
    "although the potential connection to gender ( and the corresponding issues ) will not be discussed in this paper ( it will be the focus of a future paper ) , i hypothesize that gender equality ( or a lack thereof ) also has an effect on the mental health of women at the university .",
    "i speculate this is an issue because of my own experiences and from the stories women at the university have shared with me .",
    "i always tell my students that learning mathematics is like learning a language ; and no one is born speaking automatically .",
    "a person needs a certain amount of exposure and practice before being able to speak any language .",
    "therefore , it can not be expected for individuals to form proper sentences before becoming familiar with words , sentence structure and grammar .",
    "it is natural and in fact , a part of the learning process to mispronounce words or use them incorrectly .",
    "this same argument also holds for the language of mathematics .",
    "people can find learning mathematics to be challenging and even overwhelming because of the unfamiliarity .",
    "making mistakes is an unavoidable part of the learning process .",
    "however , this does not imply that mistakes ( i.e. , failing ) should be treated as catastrophes unless one approaches failure in an unproductive way .",
    "[ ht ]     studies have consistently shown that review is essential in order to learn new information .",
    "the study of memory was initiated by the german psychologist named hermann ebbinghaus . in 1885",
    ", he published a paper describing what we now call the _ learning curve _ and the _ curve of forgetting _",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "ebbinghaus curve of forgetting is depicted in fig .",
    "3 . it illustrates the exponential decay of learning new information from a single learning session @xcite .",
    "it indicates that if one does not _",
    "actively _ review newly learned information within the first 24 hours , only 33@xmath0 of the information originally absorbed will be retained .",
    "therefore , students should review their notes within the first 24 hours after attending class to help store the information to long - term memory .",
    "4 depicts how reviewing on a regular basis can help ensure one does not forget new material @xcite .",
    "however , it is essential to review from day one .",
    "if students consistently prepare for class , learning will be a much more rewarding and enjoyable experience .",
    "[ ht ]     due to these findings , i structured my classes for the last couple of years to have _ end of lecture _",
    "( eol ) assignments rather than the typical weekly assignments given in university math classes .",
    "however , this was a decision that i personally made for my own sections .",
    "i wanted to investigate if such a structure would be beneficial in a multi - section course , i.e. , if all sections did eol assignments rather than weekly assignments . in the fall 2014 term at the university of waterloo , i had the opportunity to carry out such an experiment .",
    "i coordinated the second year honours math linear algebra class , referred to as _",
    "math 235_. this course is required for all math majors , but typically is not considered the most enjoyable course .      for the math 235 fall 2014 class , all 459 students had a class every monday , wednesday and friday .",
    "after each class , the students were given three to five questions that were due on the next day of the class .",
    "upon surveying the students three weeks into the term , the following was discovered :    * 94@xmath0 of 110 students said : _ i think the eol assignments are making me keep up with the course material . _ * 91@xmath0 of 110 students said : _ i feel like the eol assignments are improving my learning .",
    "* 60@xmath0 of 102 students said : _ i feel less anxious coming to class after doing an eol assignment . _ * 52@xmath0 of 98 students said : _",
    "i look forward to coming to class more after completing an eol assignment . _",
    "after the midterm test the students said the following :    * 79@xmath0 of 159 students said : _ i think the eol assignments helped me be more prepared for the midterm . _",
    "+ 18@xmath0 of the 159 students said : _ the eol assignments did not make a difference [ in preparing them for the midterm ] .",
    "_ * 54@xmath0 of 142 students said : _ i feel like the eol assignments influenced my confidence for the midterm in a positive way . _",
    "+ 25@xmath0 of the 142 student said : _ the eol assignment did not influence [ my confidence for the midterm ] at all . _ * 37@xmath0 of 159 students said : _ i feel like the eol assignments helped reduce my test anxiety for the midterm .",
    "_ + 23@xmath0 of the 159 students said : _ i do not have any sort of test anxiety . _    after the final exam , the students said the following :    * 90@xmath0 of 119 students said : _",
    "i enjoyed the [ math 235 ] class . _",
    "* 90@xmath0 of 124 students said : _ i think the eol assignments helped me learn and keep up with the material regardless of liking the eol assignments .",
    "_ * 61@xmath0 of 115 students said : _",
    "i enjoyed the eol assignments .",
    "* 66@xmath0 of 122 students said : _ the eol assignments helped me structure my study habits for math 235 . _ * 45@xmath0 of 93 students said : _ i have applied such study habits to other classes or am planning to do so next term .",
    "* 68@xmath0 of 130 students said : _ i understood more of the material in math 235 compared to my other classes . _",
    "+ 27@xmath0 of the 130 students said : _ there was no difference in understanding compared to my other classes .",
    "_ * 45@xmath0 of 109 students said : _ the eol assignments helped my mental well - being . _",
    "+ 27@xmath0 of the 109 students said : _ i do not know if the eol assignments helped my mental well - being .",
    "_      at the end of term , the marks of all 459 students who took and completed math 235 in fall 2014 were analyzed .",
    "i hypothesized that the fall 2014 group would outperform other math 235 sections that instead completed weekly assignments rather than eol assignments . to test against my hypothesis",
    ", i also analyzed the marks of 387 students who took and completed math 235 in the fall 2013 and spring 2014 terms .",
    "for all three of these terms i was one of the instructors and the same material was taught .",
    "in particular , i had two sections in both fall terms , and one section in the spring 2014 term",
    ". however , one of my sections from fall 2013 and spring 2014 were not included in the sample of 387 students .",
    "this is due to the fact that my sections completed eol assignments whereas the other sections had weekly assignments consisting of the same questions . for convenience",
    ", i will refer to the fall 2014 group as the _ eol assignment group _ and the remaining group as the _ weekly assignment group_.    .descriptive statistics of the weekly assignment group .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the p - value of the interactions is @xmath1 and so , the null hypothesis @xmath2 is rejected .",
    "we conclude there are statistically significant differences in the interaction between the different types of course evaluation ( i.e. , assignment , midterm , final and overall marks ) and the groups of students .",
    "we can plot the mean interactions to examine the interactions more carefully .",
    "these plots can be seen below in fig .",
    "lines that are roughly parallel are indications of the lack of interaction , while lines that are not roughly parallel indicate interaction .",
    "therefore , in summary , these are incredibly small p - values indicating that the null hypotheses do not seem appropriate .",
    "this strongly indicates that the groups of students were not comparable .",
    "it appears there was a fundamental difference between how the students from the weekly assignment group and eol assignment group absorbed and understood the math 235 material .",
    "however , in order to make any further statements , more data would have to be collected and analyzed .      in conclusion , by comparing figs .",
    "5 to 10 and the obtained p - values for the anova tests , it appears that there is a statistically significant difference between the performance of the weekly assignment group and eol assignment group .",
    "in addition , the results depicted in figs . 7 to 9 seem to support the concept illustrated in ebbinghaus forgetting curve .",
    "that is , if students are able to review and test their knowledge on a more frequent basis , they will better understand the material and thus , perform better in classes .",
    "perhaps if the math assignments , at least for certain courses , were structured in a similar fashion as the eol assignments rather the weekly assignments , the students may obtain higher grades .",
    "furthermore , from the survey results , we can see that at least for a portion of the students , such a structure may increase confidence , reduce anxiety and stress .",
    "after reviewing the survey results discussed above , i spent much time talking with students individually and in small groups .",
    "all the feedback inspired the suggestions that i will now present .",
    "as a note to the reader , one suggestion is implementing better ways to integrate technology into the education system .",
    "i think this is an important aspects that needs serious consideration , and so it will be the focus of the proceeding paper .      during orientation week training at the university of waterloo , orientation leaders are told to expect one out of two students to have some sort of mental health issue .",
    "orientation leaders are also told to be alert for suicidal students .",
    "this high value suggests that mental health training for professors would be beneficial .",
    "recall that from the student surveys , out of 107 students , 72@xmath0 think professors should have such training .",
    "desperate , mentally vulnerable people have the potential to be a danger to themselves or others ; the faculty needs to know how to deal with such situations .",
    "a wide variety of canadian universities and colleges have conducted surveys showing that poor mental health , including suicidal thoughts , attempts and overall rates , is becoming a larger issue @xcite .",
    "one proposal to counteract this pandemic is to introduce a fall reading week .",
    "this is a solution that could be easily implemented ; and in fact , many colleges and universities have already done so .",
    "for instance , flemming college , brock university , wilfrid laurier university , and queen s university all now have fall reading weeks @xcite .",
    "a recent survey at the university of waterloo showed that 74@xmath0 of over 6,000 students polled want a fall reading week .",
    "however , according to university spokesman nick manning :  implementing a reading week at the university of waterloo is complicated by the demands of our co - op education program .",
    "so it s not as straight forward as the other 14 universities in ontario who have been able to implement a reading week \" @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the university of waterloo senate will be voting hopefully this year on the perspective of having a fall reading week @xcite .",
    "although , this was done approximately ten years ago , and the referendum never passed .",
    "a fall reading week at the university of waterloo would only require two additional school days to be added to the fall term @xcite .",
    "another suggestion would be for the university to consider students mental health in the same fashion as physical health , i.e. , universities and colleges could employ mental health days like we do sick days .",
    "for instance , if a student is physically ill , especially with the influenza virus , alternative arranges or exceptions for courses are usually made for the student . until recently , in the case of influenza , the university of waterloo created a special form when h1n1 was at its peak .",
    "students could submit the ` declaration of absence for influenza - like illness ' form online excusing them from class and the corresponding missed work without being penalized @xcite .",
    "consider if a student for instance was going through a suicidal episode , a similar form could be equally beneficial , humane and perhaps even reduce drop - out rates @xcite . upon surveying my students i found that",
    ":    * 71@xmath0 of 102 students said : _ there should be mental health days like there are sick days . _ * 67@xmath0 of 95 students said : _ i think mental health days would be useful in a university setting .",
    "_    i personally hypothesize that mental illness is like the seasonal flu - anyone can have it or contract it . if this conjecture turns out to have enough supporting evidence , implementing mental health days especially seems appropriate .",
    "interestingly , in a survey , students were asked if they agreed with such a hypothesis and 76@xmath0 of 45 students agreed .",
    "[ ht ]     a typical concern regarding the implementation mental health days is that they will be abused far more than sick days .",
    "thus , in a survey , i asked my students what their view were on the potential abuse of mental health days .",
    "11 shows the distribution of the 111 students who responded .",
    "one can see that 44@xmath0 of the students said mental health days are more likely to be abused than sick days ; whereas 42@xmath0 did not think there would be a difference .",
    "my hypothesis is that mental health days would be abused the same amount as sick days . as some students have pointed out in the survey :    * _ they would be abused the same amount as sick days , in some cases , due to the physical effects of certain mental illnesses , mental health days @xmath3 sick days .",
    "i think mental health is the same as  sick \" , both can make it difficult to perform at your best. _",
    "one complaint that i often hear from students ( and agree with ) is that  many mathematicians are socially - inept . \"",
    "the comparison of stem individuals to those of autism - spectrum disorder ( e.g. , asperger syndrome ) is not uncommon , especially by the student body .",
    "typically , students label and associate ` social - ineptness ' when their peers or professors seem to lack empathy , have abnormal social interaction(s ) , minimal social interactions(s ) , or scant communication(s ) @xcite .",
    "although this may initially sound offensive , it is supported by modern research .",
    "for example , one study was conducted in 2001 with a group of 840 students from cambridge university ( 454 males , 386 females ) where each student was given an autism - spectrum quotient test ( aq ) @xcite .",
    "this test attempts to measure autistic traits for ` individuals of normal intelligence . '",
    "the researchers found that scientists obtained higher aq scores compared to non - scientists .",
    "in particular , it was found that within scientific fields , mathematicians had the highest aq scores .",
    "physical scientists , computer scientists and engineers also had higher scores compared to students in ` human or life - centered ' sciences ( specifically medicine , veterinary science and biology ) @xcite .",
    "these results also agreed with an earlier study carried out in 1998 again at cambridge university .",
    "it was found that autism occurred `` significantly more often in families of students in the fields of physics , engineering , and mathematics '' @xcite .",
    "overall , ",
    "it seems that people who have autistic traits may find it easier or more natural to work in these fields , \" said simon baron - cohen ; the co - director of the autism research centre at cambridge university @xcite .",
    "i found these studies to be quite intriguing since it has also been revealed that on average , millennials spend around seven to eleven hours a day in front of some sort of computer screen ( desktop , tablet , smart phone etc . )",
    "this indicates that the younger generations are not socializing ( face - to - face ) nearly as much as previous generations .",
    "hence , children now do not gain as much experience physically socializing with others , which can be quite problematic . learning how to read body language , especially facial expressions , is an imperative part of physiological development @xcite .",
    "facial expressions for instance are a form of nonverbal communication that conveys emotion .",
    "in fact , facial expressions are one of the primary ways that emotion is communicated between individuals @xcite .",
    "being able to witness a person s reaction activates mirror neurons , allowing one to simulate what another is experiencing @xcite .",
    "a part of the brain that plays a key role in facial recognition is the amygdala @xcite .",
    "as we currently understand , the amygdala which is part of the limbic system in the brain , processes emotional reactions , memory formation and decision making @xcite .",
    "it plays an essential role in storing and forming memories associated with emotional experiences @xcite , and researchers speculate that the amygdala may be highly involved in recognizing negative emotions @xcite . individuals with a larger amygdala are better able to recognize the emotional state of others through facial expressions .",
    "therefore , researchers hypothesize that larger amygdalae may be an indication of greater emotional intelligence . the development of the amygdala is correlated with involvement in social networks .",
    "more specifically , the size of the amygdala increases according to the number of social interactions a person has . the variations and",
    "complexity of different social groups also influences development @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in addition , several studies have indicated that the amygdala has a significant role in mental states and hence , poor mental health @xcite .",
    "for instance , some studies have shown that children with anxiety disorders usually have a smaller left amygdale .",
    "an overactive left amygdala seems to be associated with borderline personality disorder and depression ; whereas an underactive left amygdala seems to be correlated with psychopathy . in general",
    ", the amygdala seems to be connected with social anxiety , obsessive compulsive disorders , social phobias , bipolar disorder and not surprisingly , autism - spectrum disorders @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "studies have demonstrated that people with autism - spectrum disorders have a difficult time identifying facial expressions . in particular , some research has suggested that such disorders escalate due to a lack of physical social experience : `` the development of face perception and social cognitive skills are supported by the amygdala  fusiform system , and that deficits in this network are instrumental in causing autism '' @xcite .",
    "due to these studies and findings , i hypothesize that all mathematicians are  a little bit autistic \" and potentially , more susceptible to poor mental health .",
    "consider that to be a successful mathematics student , the student has to spend more time alone doing problems compared to individuals studying less technical fields . to complete an undergraduate degree in mathematics ,",
    "at least four years has to be dedicated to learning .",
    "typically such an endeavour starts around the age of 17 - 19 , sometimes even younger .",
    "if a student then enrolls into a masters or doctorate degree , that is another two to six years of intensive work . in total",
    "( not including post - doctoral fellowships ) , that is approximately four to ten years during the period in one s life where individuals grow into the people they want to be @xcite .",
    "this is a lot of time being spent alone .",
    "this may imply that the parts in the brain responsible for empathy and socialization , such as the amygdala , will not sufficiently develop ; especially compared to people with more complex social networks and interactions .    if this hypothesis is true , we may have a serious problem .",
    "if a stem background is necessary in the twenty - first century , a time where computers and the internet are an integral part of our lives , will people start becoming less socially aware and less empathetic ( for some more information see @xcite ) ?",
    "could the people who are needed to solve the world s biggest problems be more likely to suffer from psychological disorders ?",
    "these are questions that we can not afford to ignore or avoid .",
    "this hypothesis also seems to be connected with a major complaint people , and especially women have regarding mathematics or generally stem education : it is lonely .",
    "social interaction is more important biologically for women than it is for men @xcite , and women are more likely to change academic and professional paths than men due to their lack of confidence @xcite . perhaps these are reasons why there are more men in fields like maths , physics and engineering .",
    "a potential solution may sound simple : make mathematics and the education system more social with the help of technology ( which will be the focus of the next paper ) . in my opinion , we need to create an open , positive , social learning environment to nurture healthy educated people .",
    "mathematics is the only subject where proofs exist . as chris rock said : `` there is mathematics and everything else is debatable . ''",
    "it is a beautiful subject that is based in truth without ambiguity .",
    "however , to learn mathematics is no trivial task .",
    "it requires an excellent teacher , and a good state of mental health so the mind s computational power can be allotted to learning .",

    "eols do nt seem like a hassle and are mostly relevant to what we learned the day of or recently and thus are a great way of learning and reviewing class notes .",
    "please do nt get rid of them ! _ * _ the end of lecture assignments make me keep up with the material , but i just have to figure out how to manage my time better .",
    "_ * _ at first i thought the eol assignments would be too much work , but i actually really like them !",
    "i find they help me actually understand the material from every class , and if i do nt understand the material right away , i learn it sooner than i would have with weekly assignments .",
    "the weekly assignments in previous math classes ( 135 , 136 , 137 and 138 ) usually seemed difficult and quite daunting to me , but these are not so bad .",
    "yes , there are some questions i do nt always get correct or know exactly how to tackle , but having just learned the material is helpful in that it is fresh in my mind . also , i find that having the assignments after every lecture makes me actually go over the notes from each lecture , which i will admit i did not do last year at all .",
    "last year i would get to the weekly assignment and realize i had nt really understood a lot from the week s lectures , and have to go back and try to understand it then .",
    "so i think this will really help me stay on task and hopefully do better in the course .",
    "so far , i think these assignments are great , actually ! _ * _ the eols have grown on me .",
    "they re a great way to ensure that i keep up with the course material because i want to do well on the assignments .",
    "since i m keeping up more with the content during the week this makes the lectures more effective and easier to understand .",
    "the one thing i am concerned about is once midterms start , whether or not i ll have enough time  _ * _ at the start of the course when i heard about eol assignments i thought it was going to be so bad and time consuming .",
    "i thought it would be so hard to keep on top of them and balance it out with my other courses .",
    "but now i m actually surprised at how much better they are than doing weekly assignments where i would try to learn the entire week s material just before doing the assignment and it would take me much longer .",
    "i definitely think the eol assignments are a great idea ! @xmath41 _ * _ although they were a little tedious , i felt they did help with learning the new material in lecture and a way to learn as we went along in class . _",
    "* _ i did nt like them originally because i found that they were taking a lot of time and so i did nt feel as though i was putting enough time into my other courses . however , now i m not sure that i spend more time on overall on them than i would on assignments .",
    "so now i m kind of sitting on the fence as to whether i like them or not .",
    "i think they are good in making me review my notes and making sure that i understand the concepts as we go along as long as it s not to the detriment of my other courses .",
    "_ * _ they help me stay on top of the material and they reinforce the material very well .",
    "i am better prepared for lectures because of these assignments .",
    "@xmath41 _ * _ there s no way i could do 3 assignments a week for more than one class on top of the normal university work load .",
    "however , i think they re great for this class since the material is pretty complex and they ve made me excited to do well this term .",
    "@xmath41 _ * _",
    "i think they are a really great idea !",
    "they help me stay on top of the material and retain what we are learning .",
    "they also provide a lot of questions to look back on when studying for midterm / final .",
    "_ * _ @xmath41 keeps me going to school at least _ * _",
    "i really like the idea of eol assignment , it is helping me to keep up what i have just learned by forcing me to do these exercise .",
    "it divides the study time of one subject into many little sections throughout the week , and this is very efficient for absorbing the concepts .",
    "eol is great",
    "! eol rules ! _ * _ i like the fact that the eol assignments are shorter but due more regularly than the average weekly assignment from other classes .",
    "it helps me to keep on top of the material rather than procrastinating until the day before it s due ( not that i m inclined to do that for the most part ) .",
    "i like them , but i think if i had them in every class i would feel overwhelmed so a part of the reason they re affective is because my other classes only have weekly assignments .",
    "overall , a very bright idea for math 235 .",
    "_ * _ eols are a good idea , but sometime it might be too much for students who have a lot to do during the week , so online submission would be an awesome idea . _ * _ love em . the assignments",
    "keep me on top of my game .",
    "_ * _ i believe that the eol assignments were extremely helpful and i think that it would be very beneficial to the students and the university if they were incorporated into all of the courses in the math faculty",
    ". they will raise students marks and improve their understanding of the material . with these eols ,",
    "profs will be able to cover more material and push students further so that they can achieve at a higher level .",
    "_ * _ the eol assignments were much easier to manage than 1 weekly assignment .",
    "it also allowed me to review the notes after every lecture which definitely helped me to understand the content better .",
    "( if only other courses had it too @xmath42 ) _ * _ tedious but served their purpose if you kept up with them .",
    "* _ i just think they should be less frequent , i.e. , every other class . _",
    "* are you less anxious or stressed coming to class after doing an eol assignment ? * * _ despite most likely having an anxiety disorder , lectures are one of the few things in my day that cause me no anxiety .",
    "i find that i can follow the lectures and in most cases can finish the examples on my own , which makes it a stress - free time .",
    "_ * * _ more anxious .",
    "i like being flexible with my time .",
    "that is , i like to spend a day focusing on 1 - 3 things . with eols ,",
    "it forces me to know the material even when i do nt feel ready for it .",
    "i know i can learn it all on one day of the week on my own anyway . _ * * _ i feel the least amount of stress in this class and i feel that i also have the highest level of understanding compared to my other courses . _ * * _ they are good but they add to the stress of finishing work to hand in . _ * * _ they are really helping decrease my stress level .",
    "i feel more comfortable with the material and i feel like they will allow me to be successful in the course .",
    "_ * * _ i generally liked them , though they were stressful .",
    "_ * * _ they re the best !",
    "i m forced to keep up with the course content , and for the first time , i m actually keeping up with the lectures instead of furiously copying down notes and being lost in the lectures .",
    "i also love that i m not so stressed out ",
    "i m a procrastinator , and with the weekly assignments , i d find myself doing everything the night before , often having to pull all - nighters .",
    "this would ruin my entire week and cause so much stress .",
    "i honestly think that this should be implemented in the calculus classes as well , and maybe even in some of the first year courses . _"

    "<S> due to the shift of civilization from the industrial age to the information age , mathematical literacy has become a necessity in the twenty - first century . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to learn and contribute to the mathematical community , one has to be in a state of good mental health . where ` good mental health , ' is defined as one who has developed a set of healthy coping strategies , while being in a positive learning environment , and having a social support system . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , universities have been the venue of such higher learning . if these institutions want to remain as thriving grounds for higher education and engines of research , post - secondary institutions need to be aware of these factors and actively contribute to the well - being of its students and faculty . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , students do not always receive the support necessary to be mentally healthy . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to examine how social awareness and sensitivity of mental health in a university setting is a key component for individuals to flourish academically and grow personally . </S>",
    "<S> several voluntary surveys completed by first and second year math students at the university of waterloo will be presented . </S>",
    "<S> the surveys investigated the students experiences at the university , particularly in the mathematics department . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this paper explores an alternative way to structure math classes , specifically assignment scheduling , in order to help students develop healthy study habits . instead of giving students weekly - assignments which is typically done at the university of waterloo for the core math classes , </S>",
    "<S> mini - assignments were assigned after each lecture . </S>",
    "<S> this experiment was conducted for the second year linear algebra class , and the two methods are compared and statistically analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the group who completed mini - assignments after each class consisted of 459 students , whereas the group that completed weekly - assignments consisted of 387 students . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that the more frequent assignment schedule helped students increase confidence and overall grades while reducing anxiety and stress . </S>",
