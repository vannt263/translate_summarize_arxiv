    "the coherence properties of clouds of trapped bosonic atoms have been already the focus of several interesting experiments .",
    "it has been convincingly demonstrated that the single - component bose - einstein condensate is coherent on the time - scale of most experiments @xcite , while for two - state fluids the intra- and inter- component coherence survives on remarkably long time - scales despite external manipulations which displace spatially the centers of mass of the two fluids with respect to each other @xcite .    in the case of",
    "trapped two - state fermi gases with negative scattering length , the existence of a bcs transition has been predicted @xcite . by now , intensive experimental work on trapping and cooling fermionic atoms @xcite with lower and lower fractions of fermi temperature being reported and the success in trapping mixtures of bosons and fermions as well as two states of the same fermionic atom allow most of the researchers to be optimistic that the bcs critical temperature will soon be reached .",
    "the main candidates for atoms to undergo the bcs transition are @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 as defined in @xcite have an anomalously large negative s - wave scattering length ",
    "thus a relatively high critical temperature .",
    "they have also a small enough decay rate in the region of mechanical stability , which gives the system a long enough lifetime to be experimentally interesting @xcite .",
    "it is also assumed that the densities of the two components are close enough so that below the critical temperature one has the usual s - wave bcs coupling between the two states .",
    "we will denote the two states involved in pairing by @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the bcs transition is connected with the appearance of an order parameter @xcite @xmath6 .",
    "the ultraviolet divergences associated with using a contact interaction pseudopotential can be dealt , in case of metallic superconductors by introducing a cut - off at the debye energy , and in case of trapped atoms by other renormalization schemes , such as pseudopotentials regularized with the operator @xmath7 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the properties of the order parameter of cold fermionic gases in the superfluid phase have been studied in the regime close to the critical temperature , where it satisfies a ginzburg - landau equation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the spatial coherence and pairing properties of the bcs - paired two - state fermi gas at low temperatures , when the gl treatment is not applicable but instead one needs to use the bogoliubov - degennes formalism @xcite .",
    "we propose a method for checking experimentally the coherence of cooper pairs and measuring the cooper pair size .",
    "the method is based on breaking some of the cooper pairs by driving transitions between the states @xmath5 and @xmath4 with nearly - resonant light .",
    "the laser beam is split and the two resulting beams are focused on two spatially separated regions of the condensate , after which they are merged together like in a typical interferometry experiment . if both the laser and the condensate coherence are preserved between the two regions , interference should have an effect on the absorption of the light .",
    "we show that this is indeed the case and the existence of interference contributions for a given beam separation shows that the gas has coherence on that length scale .",
    "interaction of the superfluid gas with laser light has been considered earlier as a method to probe the bcs transtition of the gas @xcite . in these proposals",
    "the paired states were coupled to some unpaired states of the atoms , and in the proposals @xcite the light was mainly thought of being off - resonant .",
    "here we consider laser - induced transitions directly between the two states that are paired .",
    "the light is nearly resonant and supposed to be absorbed in the pair breaking process .",
    "moreover , the interferometric configuration in our proposal allows to probe coherences , not only the existence of the superconducting gap .",
    "we first describe the proposed method in section 2 , then derive the absorption rate for a general laser geometry in section 3 .",
    "absorption rate and the effect of coherences in the interferometric setup are considered in section 4 .",
    "the appendix discusses coherence length scales in the bsc green s functions .",
    "the basic idea of coupling the two paired states by a laser is depicted in fig.1 .",
    "the two states @xmath5 and @xmath4 are typically hyperfine ground states thus one would actually use a raman transition to couple them . in the following we will ,",
    "however , consider just laser light with one rabi frequency and detuning  in case of a raman transition these can be understood as effective quantities . likewise",
    ", fig.1 also shows only one laser driving the transition .",
    "one may make an educated guess that the laser has to have a finite detuning @xmath8 to drive the transition .",
    "this is because one has to break the cooper pair , i.e.  provide extra energy at least of the amount of twice the gap energy in order to transfer and atom from , say , state @xmath4 to state @xmath5 which makes both of the pairing partners to have the same internal state and thus become excitations in the superfluid .",
    "our calculations show that this extra amount of energy is indeed required .",
    "the scheme for probing spatial coherence is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the laser beam is split and focused into two regions with a separation @xmath9 . after this",
    "they have to be recombined , or detected nonselectively  this prevents from gaining information about from which of the beams light was absorbed .",
    "this lack of information is essential for any interference phenomena to occur .",
    "below we calculate , first for a general laser configuration , the transfer rate of atoms from one state to another  which directly corresponds to the rate of absorption .",
    "then we demonstrate the idea by considering a specific interferometric configuration .",
    "in the rotating wave approximation the interaction of the laser light with the matter fields can be described by a time - independent hamiltonian in which the detuning @xmath8 plays the role of an externally imposed difference in the chemical potential of the two states .",
    "the total hamiltonian becomes then @xmath10 , where @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the chemical potential of the fermi gas before the laser was turned on , the same for both of the components in order to allow standard bcs pairing .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath13 is the bcs - approximation of the matter hamiltonian with the chemical potential included @xcite .",
    "the transfer hamiltonian is given by @xmath14 with @xmath15 characterizing the local strength of the matter - field interaction .",
    "we consider that at the time @xmath16 the system was in its bcs ground state , @xmath17 .",
    "then the laser field has been turned on .",
    "the intensity of the electromagnetic field is small enough for the transfer hamiltonian @xmath18 to be just a perturbation on @xmath13 .",
    "the main observable of interest is the rate of transferred atoms from , say , state @xmath19 to state @xmath20 .",
    "this also directly corresponds to the absorption of the light .",
    "it is defined @xmath21 as @xmath22 in the following we call @xmath23 the current in analogy to metallic superconductors where the flux of electrons out of the superconductor constitutes the electrical current .",
    "we introduce an interaction representation with respect to @xmath24 and use linear response theory with respect to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "validity of the linear response theory requires that the laser intensity is small and the transfer of atoms can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "this implies also that the amount of atoms transferred from one state to another is not so big that it would severely imbalance the chemical potentials of the two species of atoms and thus break the bcs state . in order to simplify notation",
    "we denote @xmath26 where @xmath27 is any operator .",
    "the current becomes @xmath28|\\psi_{bcs } \\rangle .\\ ] ] here for example @xmath29 are the transfer hamiltonian and the current operator in the representation ( [ repre ] ) .",
    "we introduce the operator @xmath30 ; using this the current of atoms to the @xmath20 state becomes @xmath31|\\psi_{bcs}\\rangle   \\\\   & & - e^{i\\delta   ( t - t')}\\int d\\vec{r}\\int d\\vec{r}'\\langle\\psi_{bcs}|\\left[\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}(\\vec{r},t ) , \\hat{a}(\\vec{r}',t')\\right]|\\psi_{bcs}\\rangle\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression can be calculated by introducing a matsubara correlation function @xmath32 which gives the rate of transfer by @xmath33 $ ] with the retarded correlation function defined by @xmath34 . in the spirit of wick s theorem",
    ", we split the matsubara function into a part which contains only the superconductor green s function @xmath35 and a part which contains only the anomalous superconductor green s funtion @xmath36 : @xmath37 , @xmath38 after summation over matsubara frequencies , and choosing zero temperature and @xmath39 , we get @xmath40 with @xmath41 here the triplet @xmath42 is a solution of the ( nonuniform ) bogoliubov - de gennes equations @xcite @xmath43u_{n}(\\vec{r } ) + \\delta   ( \\vec{r})v_{n}(\\vec{r})\\\\ -\\epsilon_{n}v_{n}(\\vec{r } ) & = & \\left[\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\vec{\\nabla}^{2 }   + v(\\vec{r } ) + u(\\vec{r } ) -\\mu\\right]v_{n}(\\vec{r } ) - \\delta^ { * } ( \\vec{r})u_{n}(\\vec{r}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath44 is the external potential and @xmath45 is the hartree field . given the potential @xmath44 one can solve the bogoliubov - degennes equations and insert the results into ( [ unu])-([doi ] ) .",
    "> from the equations ( [ unu])-([doi ] ) on can immediately see that given a non - trivial spatial dependence of the laser profile @xmath46 , the bcs coherence , that is , the spatial coherence of @xmath47 in different length scales will have an influence on the current . in the following section we demonstrate this by a simple example .",
    "we consider the setup of fig.2 , where the laser beam is split and focused in the @xmath9-direction but homogeneous in the two other directions , that is @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "this gives stronger @xmath9-dependence than focusing into two points , and is probably also experimentally simpler .    in order to derive instructive results in closed form we consider the case of a uniform gas",
    "this corresponds to working in a region of space much smaller than the oscillator length of the trap , or having a shallow trap where confinement effects are small .",
    "solutions of the bogoliubov - degennes equations are given in this case by @xmath49    cylindrical coordinates and momenta are used and the sums are transformed into integrals .",
    "the currents ( [ unu])-([doi ] ) become @xmath50\\delta ( e_{q } + e_{k } - \\delta ) \\label{cur1 } \\\\ i_{\\uparrow , { \\cal f } } & = & \\frac{|\\omega |^{2}}{2}\\int   u_{k}v_{k}u_{q}v_{q}\\left [ 1 + \\cos ( k_{z } + q_{z})z\\right]\\delta ( e_{q } + e_{k } - \\delta ) . \\label{cur2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and the integral symbol means @xmath54 .",
    "one can investigate how absence of coherence affects the results by attaching to @xmath55 and @xmath56 phase factors which describe random space- and time - dependent fluctuations and by averaging over them .",
    "this makes the cosine - dependent term in @xmath57 as well as the whole current @xmath58 to disappear .",
    "thus one can vary @xmath9 and see whether the current varies as well  if the current becomes constant for large enough @xmath9 one knows the oscillating terms are absent , that is , coherence is not preserved in that length scale .",
    "the currents @xmath57 and @xmath58 are presented in fig.3 and 4 . in the numerics the @xmath8-functions in ( [ cur1])-([cur2 ] ) have been replaced by lorentzians of width 0.01 to describe the finite laser linewidth .",
    "it is interesting to compare the variation of the currents as a function of @xmath9 to the typical length scale of cooper pairing , the cooper pair size @xmath59 .",
    "the pair size can be estimated simply by the momentum ",
    "coordinate uncertainty relation , the uncertainty in momentum being determined by the corresponding uncertainty in energy ( the gap ) .",
    "this results to @xmath60 . in the case of figs.3 and 4 , @xmath61 .",
    "one observes oscillations occuring with approximately the period @xmath62 which is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath59 .",
    "for @xmath63 the current gradually becomes constant .",
    "the total current @xmath64 is shown in fig.5 .",
    "exactly at @xmath65 the currents @xmath57 and @xmath58 cancel each other ( this would be different in a non - homogeneous case ) but for larger values of detuning the current is non - zero .",
    "the oscillations are visible .",
    "another length scale involved is the fermi length @xmath66 given by @xmath67 .",
    "the relationship to the cooper pair size is typically @xmath68 , in case of figs.3 and 4 @xmath69 . in physical units , @xmath70 and @xmath71 in a system with particle number @xmath72 and trap frequency @xmath73 ( and the gap @xmath74 ) . if @xmath75 , the length scales are @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "thus for realistic experiments , the fermi length will always be below the diffraction limit of light and can not be resolved .",
    "this is the case for @xmath59 too for very high particle numbers and/or trap frequencies .",
    "but for moderate densities  which is expected to be the situation in the first experiments  the cooper pair size may be of the order of several micrometers which can be resolved by light in principle .",
    "note that the detuning @xmath8 has bigger than twice the gap to produce any current at all ( there is some current below @xmath78 because the @xmath8-functions in ( [ cur1])-([cur2 ] ) were replaced by lorenzians ) .",
    "thus having or not having bcs pairing ( nonzero or zero gap ) makes a significant difference in the result , which means that the method can be used also to detect the onset of the phase transition , c.f .",
    "@xcite . for certain types of perturbations",
    "the cooper - paired atomic fermi gas has also below - gap excitations .",
    "a density perturbation term of the form @xmath79 $ ] leads to appearance of a bogoliubov - anderson phonon @xcite . in our case",
    "the laser detuning gives a similar term in the hamiltonian , @xmath80 $ ] ( assuming that the laser is turned on and confined to a spatial region , one may think of @xmath8 having space and time dependence ) .",
    "the minus sign , however , leads to cancellation of certain terms in the response calculation and to the absence of the usual bogoliubov - anderson phonon .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in another publication @xcite .",
    "for standard metallic superconductors the coherence properties are usually investigated by creating interfaces with normal metals or with insulators .",
    "optical manipulation of cold alkali gases offers the unique opportunity of creating such interfaces at any point in space and of controlling at will the transfer hamiltonian across the interface .",
    "we described a method for testing bcs coherence in a system of atomic fermions cooled below the critical temperature by driving laser - induced transitions between the two paired hyperfine states in different regions of the space .",
    "we presented numerical and analytical evidence for the feasibility of the procedure .",
    "we show that the photon absorbtion rate changes when the distance between the transition regions is of the order of magnitude of the bcs correlation length .",
    "absence of coherence would make the rate independent of the distance .",
    "the method can serve as well for the detection of the onset of bcs transition , because the absorption peak is shifted to the detuning of twice the gap energy .",

    "g. baym and prof .",
    "j. leggett for useful discussions .",
    "the currents @xmath57 and @xmath81 are convolutions of pairs of correlation functions , thus their direct connection with @xmath59 and @xmath66 is not transparent . in this appendix",
    "we discuss the dependence of the bcs correlation funtions on these length scales .",
    "it gives insight in the physics of cooper - pair coherence and to the more complicated length scale dependence of @xmath57 and @xmath81 .",
