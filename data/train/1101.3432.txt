    "the analysis of the experimental data associated to the production of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy ion collisions at rhic ( brookhaven , usa ) and lhc ( cern ) is interpreted , despite the large errors involved , as an evidence that this state of matter is a strongly interacting fluid at high temperature ( @xmath0 mev ) , composed of deconfined adjoint ( gluons ) and fundamental ( quarks ) matter .",
    "the qgp is supposed to have existed in the immediate moments after the big bang , hence the importance to understand its behaviour .",
    "unfortunately , due to the strong nature of the interaction , the well - known perturbative methods of qcd are not sufficient to study the qgp .",
    "lattice calculations proved a valuable tool , however they are not well suited to study real - time properties of the system .",
    "these properties include the transport coefficients which govern the hydrodynamic behaviour at long distances and times as compared to the inverse temperature . were these coefficients known , especially the viscosities and relaxation times",
    ", we would be able to run computer simulations and compare the theoretical predictions with the observed experimental behaviour .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite exploits the holographic principle to study strongly coupled @xmath1-dimensional conformal quantum field theories by means of dual @xmath2-dimensional gravitational models in asymptotically anti - de sitter spaces . within this correspondence ( which can be extended to many non - conformal setups as well ) a thermal gauge theory is associated with a black hole background . each fluid mode in the plasma has a corresponding gravity mode , whose fluctuations , governed by gravity equations , can be used to obtain retarded correlators , from where we can obtain the transport coefficients .",
    "the main ingredient in the ads / cft correspondence is the relation @xmath3 where the source @xmath4 of the field theory operator @xmath5 is identified with the value of the dual gravitational mode at the ads boundary @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the ads radial coordinate .",
    "the correspondence is actually a limit of a conjectured more general equivalence between quantum field theories and higher dimensional string models having a gravitational description at low energy and weak coupling .",
    "at long distances and times as compared to the inverse temperature , field theories admit a hydrodynamic description dictated by the conservation of energy and momentum . this hydrodynamic description can be organized in a derivative expansion .",
    "up to second derivatives the expansion of the energy - momentum tensor for a relativistic uncharged fluid reads@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the energy density , @xmath10 the velocity field , @xmath11 the pressure , @xmath12 with @xmath13 the @xmath14-dimensional metric and @xmath15 + \\kappa \\bigl [ r^{<\\mu\\nu>}-2 u_\\alpha u_\\beta r^{\\alpha < \\mu\\nu > \\beta } \\bigr ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\lambda_1 \\sigma^{<\\mu}_{\\lambda } \\sigma^{\\nu>\\lambda } + \\lambda_2   \\sigma^{<\\mu}_{\\lambda } \\omega^{\\nu>\\lambda } + \\lambda_3 \\omega^{<\\mu}_{\\lambda } \\omega^{\\nu>\\lambda }   + \\kappa^ * 2u_\\alpha u_\\beta r^{\\alpha < \\mu\\nu > \\beta }   \\nonumber",

    "all other coefficients , i.e. the bulk viscosity @xmath21 and the second order coefficients @xmath22 (  bulk \" relaxation time ) , @xmath23 , are only defined in non - conformal plasmas .",
    "holographic methods allow to extract these transport coefficients in classes of strongly coupled plasmas having a dual gravity description .",
    "moreover , in the regime where higher derivative corrections to the gravity action can be neglected , the corresponding plasmas display some relevant universal features .",
    "for example , they all have the same shear viscosity over entropy density ratio , @xmath24 , as the @xmath25 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) plasma @xcite .",
    "remarkably this ratio is compatible with the one which can be deduced for the qgp at rhic and lhc .",
    "this raises the hope that , at least in some limits , holographic results ( despite strictly valid for theories still quite far from qcd ) , can be used as benchmarks for realistic simulations of real - time properties of the qgp .",
    "a sketch of the relevant holographic methods is as follows .",
    "consider a fluid moving along one ( say , @xmath26 ) of the 3 spatial directions @xmath27 . for any field @xmath28 on the dual gravity background , consider fluctuations of the form @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 frequency and momentum .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath32 are classified according to their transformation under @xmath33 . solving the equations of motions ( with suitably chosen boundary conditions ) for the fluctuations",
    ", one can get the dispersion relations and thus deduce the transport coefficients , taking into account general expressions like @xmath34 which holds for the scalar hydrodynamic modes @xcite . and",
    "@xmath35 are the temperature and speed of sound of the plasma .",
    "finally , @xmath36 is an `` effective relaxation time '' . ]",
    "another source of information comes from the study of retarded correlators of the stress - energy tensor . for the tensorial mode @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the pressure .",
    "the holographic computation of these correlators gives direct access to the related transport coefficients .",
    "theories like ( thermal ) @xmath25 @xmath39 sym , which has a dual @xmath40 ( black hole ) description , do not have matter fields transforming in the fundamental representation .",
    "the inclusion of fundamental matter has a precise counterpart in the dual string / gravity setup .",
    "it amounts on adding extended sources ( like @xmath41  flavor \" d7-branes ) on the background . in the t hooft limit ( where",
    "@xmath42 whereas the t hooft coupling @xmath43 and @xmath41 are kept fixed ) , the branes can be treated as probes @xcite and thus do not deform the original background .",
    "this corresponds to taking the quenched approximation for the flavor fields in the dual gauge theory .",
    "going beyond this approximation requires accounting for the backreaction of the flavor branes on the background .",
    "this is a difficult task in general , since the branes ( which have codimension 2 in the d7 case and thus are localized at some angles of the @xmath44-sphere @xmath45 ) enter as delta function sources in the supegravity equations of motion and bianchi identities .",
    "this gives rise to a set of partial differential equations to be solved for .    in @xcite",
    "a method named `` smearing technique '' was introduced .",
    "this method is appropriate in the veneziano limit in which @xmath42 and @xmath46 with their ratio fixed . instead of considering @xmath41 localized branes one homogeneously distributes them in the transverse space , in such a way to replace delta function sources with a density distribution 2-form and to recover ( most of ) the isometries of the original unflavored background . in this way",
    "one often has to solve just ordinary differential equations in a radial variable ( see @xcite for a review ) .    in @xcite",
    "this method was applied to thermal @xmath25 sym with massless fundamental hypermultiplets ( and then extended to more general flavored quivers ) , finding a solution which takes into account the d7-brane backreaction in a perturbative expansion in the parameter @xmath47 with @xmath48 the t hooft coupling at the energy scale set by the temperature @xmath49 .",
    "this parameter would weigh the internal quark loops in a perturbative expansion of , say , gluon polarization diagrams . in the string setup",
    ", it has to be taken very small in order for the gravity description to be reliable .",
    "the solution in @xcite was analytically found to order @xmath50 .",
    "it is relevant to notice that the class of flavored plasmas here considered are examples of non - conformal models .",
    "the breaking of conformal invariance , driven by quantum effects since the flavors are massless , is precisely encoded by the running of the beta function for @xmath51 : @xmath52    the gravity solution in @xcite has a warped black hole metric of the form @xmath53 + \\frac{r^2}{r^2}\\left[\\frac{s^8f^2}{1-\\frac{r_h^4}{r^4}}dr^2 + r^2 \\left(s^2 ds_{ke}^2 + f^2 ( d\\tau + a_{ke})^2\\right)\\right]\\ , , \\label{thebac}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the horizon radius .",
    "the flavor brane backreaction is accounted for by the functions @xmath55 and the metric of the original @xmath45 is expressed as a @xmath56 fibration over a khler - einstein base @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the khler form of the four - dimensional base of @xmath45 ) .",
    "moreover @xmath59 where we have also included the running dilaton @xmath60 .",
    "the solution contains @xmath61 and @xmath62 ramond - ramond field strengths too .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details and comments on the uv behaviour of the solution .",
    "the solution described above allows us to study a number of effects of dynamical flavors in a strongly coupled thermal theory in a completely controllable setting . some thermodynamic quantities ( entropy density @xmath63 , energy density @xmath9 , free energy density @xmath64 , speed of sound @xmath35 ) are @xcite @xmath65\\ , , \\\\ f & = & -p=-\\frac18 \\pi^2   n_c^2 t^4 \\left[1+\\frac12 \\epsilon_h + \\frac16 \\epsilon_h^2\\right]\\ , , \\\\",
    "t^4 \\epsilon_h^2\\ , , \\\\ c_s^2 & = &   \\frac13 \\left[1-\\frac{1}{6 } \\epsilon_h^2\\right]\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the transport coefficients up to @xmath66 obtained by studying the gravitational fluctuations , as sketched in the previous section , are @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 , are the corresponding values in the conformal plasmas .",
    "there is a simple way to obtain , holographically , all the second order transport coefficients in the above flavored plasmas , avoiding the explicit study of fluctuating modes and correlators .",
    "the flavored @xmath25 plasma has a dual effective @xmath44-dimensional description in terms of a metric and three scalars @xcite .",
    "one of these scalars is the dilaton .",
    "the others describe the volume of the compact deformed @xmath45 and the squashing between the fiber and the base .",
    "the corresponding field theory operators have dimensions @xmath70 at the unflavored conformal fixed point .",
    "thus , giving a non trivial profile to the dilaton around the ads background corresponds to turning on a ( marginally irrelevant ) deformation in the field theory .",
    "the other scalars , instead , would drive irrelevant deformations .    at order @xmath50 the breaking of conformality",
    "can be accounted for just by the dilaton , so that the @xmath71 model reduces effectively to a single scalar one .",
    "crucially , the latter is in the chamblin - reall class @xcite , already studied in @xcite as for some hydrodynamical properties . in more generality , chamblin - reall models ( which are characterized by a simple exponential potential for the scalar field )",
    "provide good effective holographic descriptions , at leading order in the deformation , for classes of strongly coupled conformal gauge theories slightly deformed by marginally ( ir)relevant operators @xcite .    quite crucially , for the chamblin - reall theories ,",
    "all the hydrodynamic transport coefficients up to second order can be extracted @xcite using the results in @xcite . with the definition @xmath72 where @xmath35 is the speed of sound , and referring to the hydrodynamic stress - energy tensor in ( [ enmom ] ) ,",
    "the transport coefficients are given in table [ relations ] .",
    "sym plasma has these same coefficients with @xmath73 . ]",
