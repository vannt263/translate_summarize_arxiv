    "diffusion weighted mri ( dw - mri ) is a non - invasive method to measure the movements of water molecules in biological tissue .",
    "using the fact that water diffusion is mainly directed along nerve fibers , not perpendicular to them , it can be used to resolve the fibrous structure of brain white matter , with a wide range of applications in both medicine and neuro - science .",
    "dw measurements acquire a number of full 3-dimensional mri volumes with varying diffusion sensitizing gradients encoding the diffusion in different directions . from this",
    ", one tries to infer information on the diffusive properties of the tissue as parametrized by a suitable physical model of the diffusion process .",
    "the most widely - used model in this regard , the tensor model , is based on the assumption of anisotropic gaussian diffusion parametrized by a diffusion tensor in each voxel . while being quite successful , its main drawback is the inherent inability to resolve more than one diffusion direction per voxel . however , depending on the resolution , as much as a third of all voxels can contain multiple fibers .",
    "more refined approaches often replace the diffusion tensor by an _ orientation distribution function _ ( odf ) measuring either  depending on the underlying model  the diffusion probability or the density of fibers per direction for each voxel of the volume .",
    "this requires a larger number of diffusion sensitizing gradients than for the tensor model , often termed as high angular resolution diffusion imaging ( hardi ) .",
    "most models describe diffusion in each voxel separately , and for efficiency , reconstructions are usually simply carried out voxel - wise .",
    "this approach however neglects spatial coherence , i.e.  the fact that odfs in nearby voxels are often similar if they belong to the same fiber bundle .",
    "incorporating spatial coherence into the reconstruction algorithm can potentially improve the results significantly .",
    "spatial regularization was first investigated in  @xcite where similarity is measured by comparing the entire odfs in nearby voxels .",
    "smoothing methods that take into account the underlying structure of the domain @xmath0 have been suggested for example in  @xcite , where linear and non - linear diffusion filters are applied to the reconstructed odf in a post - processing step , and in  @xcite , where adaptive smoothing is performed on the hardi data prior to reconstruction .    in this paper",
    "we will study the concept of _ fiber continuity _ ( fc ) as presented in in  @xcite , which uses related ideas to regularize the odf reconstruction . here",
    "similarity between odfs is _ local _ also in the orientational part and only compares voxels along fibers instead of isotropically .",
    "this way , smoothness information can extend for example from single - fiber voxels into adjacent crossings despite the sudden appearance of perpendicular structures which violate the _ global _ similarity of the respective odfs .",
    "the approach is based on the assumption that curvature of the fiber bundles is not too large , and that the point @xmath1 belongs to a fibrous structure through @xmath2 , directed along @xmath3 .",
    "so for sufficiently small step - lengths @xmath4 , the odf field @xmath5 assigning to each voxel @xmath2 in the spatial domain @xmath6 the odf @xmath7 fulfills @xmath8 this assumption is employed in a tikhonov - type regularization scheme , with the anisotropic regularization term @xmath9    although this regularization scheme leads to good results , its theoretical properties have not been studied yet . in particular , compactness properties , which are needed to establish convergence of discrete approximations ,",
    "are not obvious since the forward operator is not smoothing in the spatial variable @xmath2 .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyze the convergence of a spatial regularization method similar to the one above for noisy , discrete data .",
    "this will be achieved by studying the properties of a non - standard sobolev - type space constructed from the anisotropic derivative .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : rec - scheme ] , we describe the diffusion model and the regularization method , and we formally introduce the sobolev - type space @xmath10 used in this method . in  [ sec : reg - with - disc ] , we review some convergence results for tikhonov regularization with approximate operators , with focus on approximation by finite dimensional operators , i.e.  discretization . in  [ sec : hfib ] , the space @xmath10 will be further investigated , and we show the main result of this paper , a compact embedding theorem that allows us to apply the convergence results from  [ sec : reg - with - disc ] to our method . finally ,  [",
    "sec : implementation ] and  [ sec : numerics ] describe some implementation details and show some numerical results , comparing the performance of the method to standard unregularized reconstructions .",
    "modelling of the dw signal is a difficult problem in itself since the diffusive properties of white matter can be quite complex .",
    "we will use the spherical deconvolution ( sd ) model that was introduced in  @xcite , which is particularly attractive due to its conceptual simplicity and linearity .",
    "it has been successfully employed in both phantom and _ in - vivo _ studies .",
    "the model describes the data as @xmath11-convolution of the ( fiber ) odf @xmath5 with a single - fiber response function @xmath12 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] that is assumed to be identical throughout the volume : @xmath13 the response function @xmath14 can either be estimated from the data in a pre - processing step or fixed a priori by modelling it e.g.  as a gaussian .",
    "a problem of this model , apart from suffering from instability due to ill - posedness , is that it can lead to odfs with negative values , which makes interpretation as a diffusion probability or fiber density impossible .",
    "therefore , one often includes non - negativity constraints @xmath15 . in the context of sd ,",
    "non - negativity constraints have been introduced in  @xcite , the resulting method being called constrained sd ( csd ) . adding the fiber continuity based spatial regularization strategy introduced in  @xcite , the method can then be written as @xmath16{t \\psi - s^\\delta}^2 + \\gamma \\int\\limits_{{\\omega \\times s^2 } } \\abs[\\big]{u^t \\operatorname{grad}\\psi(x , u)}^2 \\,dx \\,du \\bigr),\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a regularization parameter and @xmath18 is the given noisy data with @xmath19{s - s^\\delta } \\leq \\delta\\ ] ] for @xmath20 and exact data @xmath21 .",
    "note that in the context of discretization , @xmath22 quantifies both measurement errors and errors caused by interpolating the data from a finite sampling grid to all of @xmath0 .",
    "our approach differs from this slightly : instead of  , we solve @xmath23{t \\psi - s^\\delta}^2 + \\alpha \\norm[\\big]{\\psi}^2 - \\beta \\inner[\\big]{\\psi}{\\operatorname{\\delta}_{s^2 } \\psi } \\bigr .",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] this is both due to theoretical reasons to be detailed below , and the numerical experience that the additional angular smoothness introduced by the @xmath24-term improves stability of the reconstruction and reduces artifacts for curved structures .",
    "the occurrence of these artifacts is not surprising since the regularization term   was derived for locally straight fibers .",
    "however , angular smoothness also tends to blur structures and limit the achievable angular resolution of the odfs .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath25 has to be chosen carefully .    for a rigorous treatment of this optimization problem ,",
    "we first need to define the function space in which the problem is posed .",
    "the spatial domain @xmath6 will be simply taken as a cube in @xmath26 , @xmath27 with @xmath28 . in @xmath29 , introduce the orthonormal basis functions @xmath30 where @xmath31 for @xmath32 is the trigonometric orthonormal basis on @xmath6 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the spherical harmonics on @xmath11 .",

    "for @xmath39 , we denote by @xmath40 and @xmath41 the derivatives with respect to the spatial and orientational parts , respectively .",

    "the properties of this space will be studied in  [",

    "in this section , we briefly review some results on regularization with discretization and prove a variant of a result in  @xcite . discretization of   is performed as a projection method by introducing orthogonal projections @xmath60 in @xmath54 and @xmath61 in @xmath29 , with some discretization parameter @xmath62 , and replacing @xmath58 with @xmath63 i.e. @xmath64 there is a number of papers on regularization with discretization in the unconstrained case , we only cite  @xcite . under a hlder - type source condition , @xmath65 and with a suitable parameter choice , one obtains the convergence rate @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "unfortunately , the proof relies on spectral theory and therefore does not generalize to the constrained case .",

    "spectral theory can be replaced by variational techniques in regularization theory developed in the last decade . an important part in this approach",
