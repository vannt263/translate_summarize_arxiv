    "power law scaling consists of universal properties that characterize collective phenomena that emerge from complex systems composed of many interacting units .",
    "power law scaling has been observed not only in physical systems , but also in economic and financial systems [ 1 - 22 ] .",
    "the discovery of this scaling behavior in economic and financial systems has shed new light on economics , and , in recent years , has led to the establishment of a new scientific field bridging economics and physics .",
    "market economy land is one of the most important assets in capitalism .",
    "the movement of land prices has a strong influence on the economic behavior of individuals and firms [ 23,24 ] . over the past few decades",
    ", a considerable number of studies have been conducted on the scaling behavior in economic systems .",
    "nevertheless , no studies have ever tried to study the scaling behavior in a land market . here ,",
    "we introduce power law statistics in the distributions of land prices and of the relative price , as a new example of power law scaling in economic systems .",
    "in most other countries , land price is a residual of property price , calculated by the income approach : net income divided by yield , minus building cost .",
    "however , in japan , property price , including that for income producing properties , usually comprises land price plus building price , which are calculated separately .",
    "land prices are normally determined by market comparisons utilizing land price indices prepared by the government ; such as the assessed value of land by ministry of land , infrastructure and transport , whilst building prices are normally determined in the market through the cost approach .",
    "the assessed value of land is a price of a centare of a place as of january 1 , evaluated by two real estate valuers [ 25 ] .",
    "the investigation is undertaken throughout the land once a year .",
    "we analyze a database of the assessed value of land covering the 6-year period between 1995 - 2000 .",
    "the data for each of the 6 annual intervals contains the land prices in approximately 30,000 points .",
    "we first study the probability distribution of land price . in fig.1",
    ", we plot the cumulative probability distribution of land price ( s ) of 30,600 points in the year 1998 , which is the log - log plot of the cumulative probability as a function of land price .",
    "the ordinate shows the cumulative probability in a log scale , that is , the probability of finding land of a price equal to , or higher than , x. it is apparent that this plot tends towards becoming a linear function in the high price range .",
    "we find that the tail of the cumulative probability distribution of the land price is described by a power law distribution , @xmath0 the solid line in fig .",
    "1 represents this function . in the range of land prices",
    "higher than @xmath1 yen , the probability distribution follows a power low with exponent @xmath2 @xmath3 , as determined by ordinary least squares ( ols ) regression in log - log coordinates . here , @xmath4 denotes the coefficient of determination .",
    "the distribution fits the power law ( 1 ) very accurately in the high price range but it gradually deviates from ( 1 ) as the price becomes lower . as a further test of the strength of this result",
    ", i repeated the same analyses for the data of land prices for each of the periods between 1995 - 2000 .",
    "the power law exponents were in the range of @xmath5 .",
    "the results are represented in table 1 .",
    "overall , the power law distribution of land prices is very strong .",
    ".power law exponents @xmath6 for the cumulative probability distribution of japan s land prices .",
    "the results are obtained by using ols regression on data .",
    "s.e . denotes standard errors , and r2 the coefficient of determination . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to quantify the fact that the standard deviations of the relative prices vary by the price - ranges , we next calculated the standard deviation @xmath7 of the relative prices as a function of a price .",
    "3b shows how the standard deviation of the relative price increases linearly with the logarithm of price . using the ordinary least squares method on the data , the standard deviation @xmath7",
    "is estimated as @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "the reason why the price fluctuations depend on the price level is probably as follows .",
    "the land prices in urban areas are on average higher than in rural areas , and , furthermore , trades take place more actively in urban areas than in rural ones , so that the price fluctuations are generally higher in urban areas than in rural areas . as a consequence ,",
    "the price fluctuations in the high price - range are higher than the price fluctuations in the low price - range .    finally , we standardized the relative prices in order to find a form of the probability distribution of the relative prices that does not depend on the price - range .",
    "we standardized the relative price that comes into each price - range by dividing by the estimated standard deviation given a price - range . in fig .",
    "3c , we plot the logarithm of the probability density @xmath12 as a function of the logarithm of the standardized relative price @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the mean . after standardizing ,",
    "the resulting empirical probability distributions appear identical for the observations drawn from different points grouped by the price - range .",
    "we found that the conditional probability distributions could be expressed by power law distributions    @xmath15    using the ordinary least squares regression method in fig .",
    "3c , we obtained estimates for the asymptotic slope @xmath16 where @xmath17 . to test if these results for the conditional probability distributions held for the data of the other years , we analyzed the data of each year of the 6-year period between 1995 - 2000 .",
    "similar quantitative behavior was found for the conditional probability distributions .",
    "we have shown that the prices and the relative prices of land are very well described by the power law distributions .",
    "our empirical results give the conditions that any empirically accurate theories of land market have to satisfy .",
    "since no model so far has successfully satisfied the statistical properties demonstrated in this paper , the next step is to model the behavior in land markets . in modeling land markets",
    ", we should notice that land markets are complex systems compromised of many interacting agents . in land markets ,",
    "participants meet randomly and negotiated trade takes place when an agent willing to buy land meets an agent willing to sell land .",
    "the price formation in land markets is generated through this random matching process .",
    "thus , it is likely that the methods of statistical physics developed to study complex systems , from which power law scaling emerges , will be useful to describe behavior in land markets .",
    "a further important point to note is that land are a very important real asset , and the movement of land price strongly affect decision - making by consumers and firms [ 23 , 24 ] .",
    "therefore , the investigation of the relationship between land prices and other economic variables such as consumption and investment will lead us further into a new understanding of the dynamics of the macro - economy , which is a complex system that is composed of many interacting subsystems , each with a complex internal structure comprising many interacting agents .",
