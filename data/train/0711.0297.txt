    "the s / n ratio throughout the order is also lower than that for h@xmath2 . despite this , a gaussian fit to the wings of this line ( masking the line core , and the excess on the red side ) gives a systemic velocity consistent with that seen in the h@xmath2 emission .",

    "[ lc](a ) ) using the eclipsing light curve ( ) code @xcite , under the assumption that the modulation was due to x - ray heating .",
    "this provided a satisfactory fit , although because of the degeneracy between inclination angle , disc temperature and disc flaring angle , it was not possible to extract a unique parameter set , and a wide range of parameter values yielded equally good fits .",
    "however , the phasing of the subsequent light curves ( fig .",
    "[ lc](b),(c ) ) suggests that the observed modulation is not due to x - ray heating of the secondary : the most likely explanation for this is that the observed modulation is due to superhumps ( see below ) .",
    "therefore the apparent alignment of the first light curve is most likely coincidental , and the elc code ( which does not incorporate superhumps ) can not be used to extract reliable system parameters .",
    "superhumps are periodic optical modulations , originally seen during superoutbursts of su uma dwarf novae ( dne ) , but also seen in some lmxbs in outburst ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the phenomenon has also been seen in persistently bright systems .",
    "the superhump period is typically a few percent longer than @xmath12 .",
    "the current understanding is that in systems where the mass ratio is less than @xmath60.25 , the tidal truncation radius lies outside the 3:1 resonance radius .",
    "when the accretion disc radius extends out to beyond the 3:1 resonance radius , the disc becomes eccentric , and the perturbation from the secondary causes a prograde precession . for precessing discs in lmxbs , @xcite proposed that the disc area changes on the superhump period , causing the area of the disc intercepting the x - rays to increase .",
    "the increased reprocessing causes the disc to brighten , giving rise to the observed superhumps in lmxbs .",
    "several systems exhibit superhumps with almost exact sinusoidal modulations like those seen in hete  j1900.1@xmath02455 , in particular another lmxb , xte j1118@xmath10480 @xcite .",
    "the peak - to - peak amplitude of the modulation seen in hete  j1900.1@xmath02455 was @xmath60.1 mag on 2006 september 21 and 2007 june 13 , but increased to @xmath60.3 mag on 2007 june 24 .",
    "the latter amplitude is quite high , but as pointed out by @xcite superhumps due to irradiated discs are likely to appear more prominent at _ low _ inclinations : hence the large superhump amplitude supports our estimate of the inclination in section 3.2.1 . for an x - ray luminosity of @xmath610@xmath18 erg",
    "s@xmath3 the disc is likely to also suffer irradiation - driven warping ( * ? ? ? *",
    "in particular their model number 1 ) and the disc shape continuously changes under the combination of prograde apsidal precession and retrograde warped precession .",
    "such models may also explain the factor of @xmath63 increase in modulation amplitude over a relatively short timescale ( haswell , private communication ) .",
    "the location of the hotspot in the h@xmath2 doppler tomogram may be interpreted in terms of this irradiated precessing disc model : as the warped disc precesses , the gas stream / accretion disc impact point varies .",
    "how this occurs can be seen clearly in the @xcite simulations .",
    "these simulations suggest that multi - epoch doppler tomography of hete  j1900.1@xmath02455 should reveal a hotspot whose location varies between the ( @xmath68,@xmath78 ) and ( @xmath68,@xmath69 ) quadrants .",
    "previous work has shown that , once the superhump period ( @xmath79 ) is identified , then the period excess , @xmath80 (= ( @xmath81)/@xmath12 ) , can be directly related to the mass ratio @xcite .",
    "a fourier transform of our photometry , however , does not allow us to identify a unique superhump period , because our sampling is too sparse . a more comprehensive photometry campaign is required to measure @xmath79 , and estimate @xmath65 .    using the empirical relationship between the absolute visual magnitude of an irradiated accretion disc ( @xmath82 ) , the x - ray luminosity of the central source and orbital period @xcite , we find @xmath83 mag . at a distance of 4.3 kpc @xcite",
    ", such a disc should have an apparent magnitude of 16.7 @xmath13 0.5 mag .",
    "this is consistent with the measured @xmath30-band magnitude of @xmath617.1 mag , implying that the optical light , in the @xmath30-band , is dominated by an x - ray heated accretion disc .",
    "thus , x - ray heating of the disc can explain the observed optical brightness of hete  j1900.1@xmath02455 .",
    "@xcite estimated the mass of the secondary to be between 0.016 and 0.07 m@xmath4 , for primary masses between 1.4 and 2.2 m@xmath4 , but this was based on an assumption of inclination angle : 90  for the lower mass limit , and a uniform a priori distribution for the 95 per cent confidence upper limit .",
    "we have seen that for @xmath61 @xmath7 200 km  s@xmath3 , @xmath84 20  ( see fig . [ kvi ] ) . at this upper limit of @xmath61 , @xmath72 , and",
    "the minimum value of @xmath85 ( for @xmath86 m@xmath4 ) is therefore 0.05 m@xmath4 .    @xcite",
    "have computed a mass - radius relation for the secondaries in short period cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , finding that in general , the mass - radius curve lies above that for zero - age main sequence stars .",
    "an empirical equation relates @xmath85 to @xmath12 : @xmath87  m@xmath4 , where @xmath2 is the factor relating the radius of the secondaries in these cvs to that of main sequence stars with the same mass , and @xmath12 is in hours .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath2 @xmath11 1.18 .",
    "assuming that the secondary in hete  j1900.1@xmath02455 is similar to the secondary in these cv systems , this equation predicts @xmath88 m@xmath4 . with the lower limit on @xmath65 of 0.035 ,",
    "this sets an upper limit to the primary mass of @xmath89 m@xmath4 .",
    "the secondary may also be a brown dwarf , in which case @xmath85 is poorly constrained , as is @xmath75 .    finally , we briefly examine the radial velocity of hete  j1900.1@xmath02455 relative to the local galactic radial velocity . based on its position and estimated distance , hete",
    "j1900.1@xmath02455 is @xmath63.6 kpc from the galactic centre , @xmath61 kpc below the galactic plane . using the galactic rotation curve of @xcite",
    ", we find that the radial velocity of hete  j1900.1@xmath02455 is @xmath690 km s@xmath3 relative to the local galactic rotation .",
    "combined with future proper motion studies , this velocity may be used to derive the space velocity of hete  j1900.1@xmath02455 and compute its orbit around the galactic centre ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have presented a detailed optical study of the amsp hete  j1900.1@xmath02455 .",
    "the @xmath1-band light curves reveal a modulation whose phase is inconsistent with simple heating of the secondary star / accretion disc : we interpret this as due to superhumps associated with a precessing accretion disc .",
    "fitting to the wings of the averaged h@xmath2 emission line gives the systemic velocity of 132  @xmath13  8  km  s@xmath3 , and a similar value is found from the he@xmath23ii line .",
    "doppler tomography of the h@xmath2 emission line suggests a upper limit of @xmath6200  km  s@xmath3 on the projected secondary velocity , implying that hete  j1900.1@xmath02455 has a low inclination , @xmath5 20 , and a minimum secondary mass of 0.05  m@xmath4 .    assuming that the secondary in hete  j1900.1@xmath02455 is similar to those seen in short period cvs",
    ", we estimate a secondary mass of 0.085  m@xmath4 , which implies an upper limit to the ns mass of 2.4 m@xmath4 ( again for @xmath61 @xmath5 200  km  s@xmath3 ) . if the secondary is a brown dwarf , then this constraint is relaxed .",
