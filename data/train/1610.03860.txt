    "the detection of gw150914 @xcite , and the follow - up detections of gw 151226 and lvt 151012 @xcite by advanced ligo marked the beginning of gravitational wave astrophysics . detecting the electromagnetic ( em ) signals accompanying gw events",
    "is of great astrophysical significance , which allows one to locate the host galaxy and to uncover detailed physics associated with the merging events . besides the already detected bh - bh mergers ,",
    "ns - ns and ns - bh mergers are highly expected to be observed in the near future @xcite .",
    "several em counterparts of gw events due to ns - ns and ns - bh mergers have been discussed in the literature :- ray counterpart to gw 150914 , which drives interest in producing em signals from bh - bh systems through em processes @xcite or accretion @xcite . ]",
    "the leading counterpart is short - duration grbs ( sgrbs ) , which are believed to be produced via accretion of merging materials into the central bh post the mergers @xcite .",
    "current short grb observations are in general consistent with such a hypothesis @xcite .",
    "short grbs are followed by long - lasting broad - band afterglows @xcite , which are also good targets for observations as the em counterpart of gw events .",
    "the second em counterpart is the optical / ir signal powered by the radioactivity of the neutron - rich materials launched during the ns - ns or ns - bh mergers @xcite .",
    "such kind of signal , named as `` macronova '' or `` kilonova '' , has been claimed to be associated with some short grbs @xcite .",
    "the third em counterpart is the afterglow - like emission associated with the macronova materials when they interact with the ambient medium . since the ejecta is non - relativistic , the emission is mostly in the radio band and is called `` radio flares '' @xcite .",
    "no such candidate signal has been reported .",
    "all the above em signals are based on the assumption that the post - merger product is a bh .",
    "this is certainly true for ns - bh mergers .",
    "however , for ns - ns mergers it is possible that the post - merger product is still a stable ns or a supra - massive ns rather than a bh .",
    "this requires that the ns equation of state ( eos ) is hard , as suggested by the detection of a ns more massive than 2 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the observed ns masses in the galactic ns - ns binary systems are relatively small @xcite also supports the possibility of producing post - merger stable or supra - massive nss .",
    "observations of the afterglow of short grbs also suggest the possible existence of a millisecond magnetar , possibly supra - massive @xcite .",
    "invoking such a millisecond magnetar as the ns - ns post - merger product , @xcite proposed a fourth em counterpart for gw sources in the x - ray band . since a millisecond magnetar launches an essentially isotropic magnetospheric wind",
    ", the effect of the magnetar can be observed even if the observer misses the jet emission that produces the short grb .",
    "@xcite hypothesized that the magnetar wind dissipates internally and powers x - rays , probably through collision - induced magnetic reconnection @xcite or current instability @xcite .",
    "this is based on the observations of so - called  internal \" x - ray plateaus as observed in the x - ray lightcurves of some grbs @xcite .",
    "these plateaus show a very steep decay at the end , which is impossible to account for within the models that invoke external shock interactions .",
    "@xcite suggested that a wide - field x - ray detector may detect an x - ray signal coincident with a ns - ns merger gw event to be detected by ligo and other gw observatories in the future .    having a stable or supra - massive millisecond magnetar as the ns - ns merger product also has other implications for em counterparts of gw events .",
    "in particular , the steady energy injection of the magnetar spindown energy into the neutron rich ejecta would have two effects .",
    "first , the macro-/kilo - novae receives extra energy from the magnetar so that they are no longer simply powered by radioactive decay and could be much brighter than `` kilonova '' @xcite . in some extreme cases ,",
    "these events can be even observed in x - rays @xcite . following @xcite",
    ", we call such transients `` merger - novae '' .",
    "second , the external shock emission when this ejecta interact with the ambient medium is also brighter , which may be detectable in all wavelengths other than radio @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified an optical bump signature in several short grb afterglow lightcurves , which can be well interpreted as from the merger - novae .    in this paper , we study the x - ray signature proposed by @xcite in more detail . we introduce the concepts of `` free zone '' and  trapped zone \" for x - ray photons and calculate possible x - ray lightcurves for different viewing angles and different magnetar parameters ( sect .",
    "2 ) . through monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we derive the luminosity function of these transients .",
    "since these x - ray transients have not been firmly detected , we use the non - detection to constrain the solid angle of the free zone as well as the event rate density of these transients ( sect .",
    "3 ) . the fraction of supra - massive nss also depend on the eos of the ns ( or quark star , qs ) , so we also investigate how our predictions depend on eos . by comparing with other x - ray transients ,",
    "we make predictions of the detectability of these transients by future wide - field x - ray detectors , such as einstein probe @xcite .",
    "we consider a ns - ns merger which leaves a stable or supra - massive millisecond magnetar behind .",
    "the post - merger geometric configuration may be delineated by a cartoon picture in figure [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "since the open field angle of a millisecond magnetar is very wide , one can approximate a nearly isotropic pulsar wind .",
    "the x - rays produced by the internal dissipation of the magnetar wind are assumed to be emitted isotropically , whose luminosity tracks the dipole spin - down luminosity of the magnetar with a certain efficiency @xmath8 .",
    "numerical simulations of ns - ns mergers show that around @xmath9 to @xmath10 @xmath7 ejecta are ejected during the merger process @xcite .",
    "these launched ejecta cover a significant solid angle .",
    "the x - ray photons can escape freely to the observer only when there is no ejecta in front .",
    "otherwise , they are trapped by the ejecta and would first heat and accelerate the ejecta ( along with the poynting flux ) and eventually escape when the ejecta becomes optically thin .",
    "considering that such a system may also launch a relativistic jet in the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one may define three zones ( figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) :    * jet zone : the direction where a short grb can be detected .",
    "the x - rays from magnetar wind dissipation can be also observed , which powers the x - ray internal plateau as seen in a good fraction of short grbs @xcite ; * free zone : the direction where no short grb is observed but x - rays can still escape freely . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] this zone is marked as an annular ring around the jet , but in principle it can include the solid angle patches not covered by the ejecta in any direction ; * trapped zone : the direction where x - rays are trapped by the dynamical ejecta .",
    "one has the sum of the solid angles @xmath11 short grb observations suggest a typical opening angle of @xmath12 ( even though with a wide distribution ) so that the average jet solid angle is @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we then define a solid angle ratio parameter @xmath14 with which the relative distributions among the three solid angles can be settled .",
    "the millisecond magnetar losses its rotation energy through both magnetic dipole radiation and gravitational wave ( gw ) radiation , with a total spin - down rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the second term describes the gw radiation energy loss term , which describes the direct energy loss rate from the system , which does not affect the evolution of the remnant .",
    "the first term is the magnetic dipole radiation or magnetar wind spin - down term . in the following ,",
    "we define the negative of this term as the dipole spin - down luminosity @xmath22 which is directly related to the total energy power of the em counterparts in the system . dropping out one of the two terms in the right hand side of eq.([eq : edot ] ) , one can define two characteristic spin - down time scales @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the initial angular velocity and period of the magnetar , respectively , and the convention @xmath26 has been adopted .",
    "the overall spin - down time scale of the magnetar , which defines the time when the dipole spin down luminosity @xmath27 decreases with time as a power law , can be defined as @xmath28 the spin - down luminosity ( eq.([eqs : lsd ] ) ) behaves as @xmath29 for @xmath30 , and @xmath31 for @xmath32 .    in the free zone , internal dissipation of the magnetar wind",
    "gives an x - ray luminosity which scales with @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath33 where @xmath8 is the efficiency of converting the dipole spin down luminosity to the observed x - ray luminosity .      in the trapped zone , the dissipated photon energy defined by eq.([eqs : lsd ] )",
    "is trapped in the ejecta .",
    "together with the non - dissipated poynting flux energy , it is used to heat the ejecta and accelerate the ejecta via @xmath34 work .",
    "the optical depth of the ejecta is written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the opacity of the ejecta .",
    "the ejecta is initially opaque when @xmath37 , so that x - ray emission is essentially the wien tail of the mergernova photosphere emission , if there is no significant energy dissipation and comptonization below the photosphere ( which we assume for simplicity in this paper ) .",
    "the trapped magnetar wind however becomes transparent after @xmath38 defined by @xmath39 .",
