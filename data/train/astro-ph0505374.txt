    "the connection between interstellar magnetic fields and the phenomenon of bipolar outflow from young stars is a topic of great observational and theoretical interest ( e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "oh masers provide a useful tool for probing the kinematics and the magnetic field on subarcsecond scales , near the centres of bipolar outflows from massive young stars @xcite .",
    "the oh masers are generally found at distances from a few hundred to a few thousand au from the central source , and are sensitive to magnetic fields as small as 1  mg through the zeeman effect .",
    "a series of oh maser studies has revealed a common pattern of oh masers tracing a dense molecular disc perpendicular to the bipolar outflow , with the magnetic field twisted in the way predicted by the magnetohydromagnetic models by @xcite and others ( hutawarakorn & cohen 1999 , 2003 , 2005 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic field is oriented along the outflow direction on the 10-arcsec scales probed by submm - polarimetry , but has a toroidal component wound around the outflow on the arcsec scale probed by the oh masers .",
    "this appears in the form of a magnetic field reversal on opposite sides of the disc . in the present paper",
    "we consider the oh masers associated with the well known outflow source cepheusa .",
    "cepheusa is a nearby star - forming region ( within 1kpc ) and the densest part of the molecular cloud complex located to the south of the cepheus ob3 association ( @xcite ) .",
    "the large - scale ( @xmath210 arcmin ) morphology of this cloud seen in co emission implies bipolar outflow at velocities of @xmath225kms@xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the base region of cepa observed in the nh@xmath4 and co lines with angular resolutions of 2 arcsec and 15 arcsec respectively , shows a quadrupolar structure of the molecular outflow ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observations of several thermal lines confirm the presence of multiple outflows ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the complexity of the spatial and velocity structure of the cepa region , characteristic of turbulent flow , is supported by maps of the h@xmath5 emission line at 2.1@xmath6 m ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found several compact hii regions ( chiirs ) at centimetre wavelengths ; these mostly follow the edges of the nh@xmath4 clouds ( @xcite ) .",
    "all of those chiirs are younger than 10@xmath7yr and some of them are likely associated with high - mass powering stars of spectral types b3 or earlier ( @xcite ) .",
    "some chiirs are accompanied by clusters of oh , h@xmath5o and ch@xmath4oh masers ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "systematic studies of oh masers with high angular resolution revealed that most oh components move away from the central chiirs on an estimated outflow time - scale of @xmath2300yr ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations of h@xmath5o masers indicate the presence of remarkable linear and arcuate structures , which can delineate shock fronts or discs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the h@xmath5o maser structure centred on the source hw2 is interpreted as due to a molecular disc , 600au in diameter , which is perpendicular to the thermal radio jet .",
    "the inferred mass of the powering source is @xmath220  m@xmath8 , i.e. it is a b0.5 or earlier star ( @xcite ) .    in the paper",
    "we report full polarimetric observations of cepa in the 1.6ghz oh maser lines .",
    "zeeman splitting of the oh maser lines at 1665- and 1667mhz gave a value of @xmath13.5 mg , where the plus sign indicates a field directed away from us .",
    "another zeeman pair has been identified in the 22-ghz water maser line ; the inferred field strength is @xmath03.2 mg @xcite , that is , pointing towards us .",
    "such magnetic fields are believed to have an non - negligible dynamical effect @xcite .",
    "we attempt to extend previous the observations by using new polarization data to obtain an overall structure of magnetic field in the central region of cepa .",

    "cepa was observed in 1999 in all four ground - state oh transitions using 6 telescopes of the multi - element radio linked interferometer network ( merlin ) ( table 1 ) .",

    "the spectral bandwidth of 250  khz , covering a velocity range of 45kms@xmath3 , was divided into 128 channels , yielding a channel spacing of 0.35kms@xmath3 .",

    "the phase - referencing technique was applied at all epochs with the continuum source 2300 + 638 used as a phase - calibrator .",

    "the cycle - times between cepa and the reference were 5.5min+2min at the main line transitions and 6.5min+2min at the satellite line transitions .",
    "in addition 3c286 and 3c84 were observed for 1 - 3 hours in all sessions , at the relevant narrow and wide - band frequencies corresponding to the frequencies given in table 1 ( corrected to the appropriate @xmath10 for the narrow - band configurations ) .",
    "3c286 was used as the primary calibrator for the flux density scale and for the polarization angle ; 3c84 was used as the point source , bandpass calibrator and for the polarization leakage corrections .",
    "data reduction was carried out using standard procedures @xcite with the local d - programs at jodrell bank and the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . to map the emission we used a circular gaussian beam of full width half maximum ( fwhm ) 120mas and the pixel separation was 40mas in all epochs of observations",
    "( the synthesised beams for all data are given in table 1 ) .",
    "the rms noise ( @xmath11 ) levels in emission - free stokes @xmath12 single channel maps were typically a few mjybeam@xmath3 ( table 1 ) .",
    "the 1665-mhz data taken on may 20 were affected by the ringing effect .",
    "this data set was therefore smoothed using a hanning function .",
    "a region of 20 arcsec by 20 arcsec centred at ra@xmath13 , dec@xmath14 ( j2000 ) was inspected for total intensity emission ( @xmath12 stokes parameter ) stronger than 5@xmath11 .",
    "we fitted 2 dimensional gaussian components to each patch of maser emission in each channel to measure its position and flux density .",
    "the emission was considered to be real if present at least in three contiguous channels .",
    "we measured the flux densities in the images of the other stokes parameters at the position of each @xmath12 stokes component , using the local aips task mfquv .",
    "we grouped series of components above @xmath15 arising from similar positions in successive channels into features and analysed them .",

    "this leads to derived gas densities in the range from 8@xmath910@xmath21 to 5@xmath910@xmath22@xmath20 .",
    "such numbers are typical for oh masers in star - forming regions , according to the model of @xcite .",
    "additionally , this model predicts that in the case of accelerative fields with velocity shifts of 23kms@xmath3 the 1665-mhz line dominates at all number densities .",
    "in fact , the masing region in cep  a expands with a velocity of 2.5kms@xmath3 @xcite and the 1665-mhz emission does appear at least twice as strong as the 1667-mhz line ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the evolutionary path of star - forming regions is seen in their polarization characteristics .",
    "they detected a systematic increase in the degree of polarization from the oldest source to the youngest one in ngc7538 .",
    "in general , cepa showed highly polarized masers with weak linear polarization ( typically a few percent ) but strong circular polarization ( typically @xmath2350percent ) .",
    "the median @xmath24 for 1665- and 1667-mhz features is 80percent .",
    "that confirms the young evolutionary stage of the cepa region ( similarly to the object irs 11 in ngc7538 ) .",
    "there are no significant differences between the polarization properties of regions 2 and 3 what implies a similar age for all hii regions .",

    "6 we present measurements of the velocity separations of the components of the zeeman quartet over a longer period of 25 years .",
    "we include previously reported data from 1980@xmath090 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and unpublished measurements taken with the lovell antenna in the period 1990@xmath095 ( cohen et al .",

    "our interferometric data gave separations between peaks of 1.9kms@xmath3 at 1665mhz and 1.1kms@xmath3 at 1667mhz in 1999 .",
    "we also detected the zeeman quartet with the nanay antenna in 2002 october and 2004 september ( szymczak et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the velocity separations were then 1.952 , 1.93kms@xmath3 ( at 1665mhz ) and 1.15 , 1.11kms@xmath3 ( at 1667mhz ) in both epochs , respectively . taking the whole 25-year period we used least - squares fits to estimate the rates of change in line splitting , obtaining @xmath25kms@xmath3yr@xmath3 for the 1665-mhz line and @xmath26kms@xmath3yr@xmath3 for the 1667-mhz line .",
    "the rates of change of field strength implied are @xmath27mgyr@xmath3 from the 1665-mhz line and @xmath28mgyr@xmath3 from the 1667-mhz line .",
    "the two estimates for the magnetic field decay differ significantly of the 2.3@xmath11 level ( 3 percent ) .",
    "this is also apparent in the lowest panel of fig .",
    "the ratio of line splitting should be 1.67 from theory whereas the observed ratios are 1.70@xmath01.82 .",
    "it is most likely those deviations are caused by blending ( sect.3.3 ) .",
    "in particular , 1665-mhz features c and c and 1667-mhz feature a all have similar velocities to the zeeman quartet .",
    "it is imposible to correct data for this effect .",
    "we take the weighted mean of the 1665- and 1667-mhz results as our best estimate of the magnetic field decay .",
