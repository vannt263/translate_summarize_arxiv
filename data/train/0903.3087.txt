    "the current accelerating expansion of the universe indicated by the astronomical measurements from high redshift supernovae@xcite as well as accordance with other observations such as the boomerang / maxima / wmap data@xcite and galaxy power spectra@xcite becomes one of the biggest puzzles in the research field of cosmology .",
    "one popular theoretical explanation approach is to assume that there exists a mysterious energy component , dubbed dark energy , with negative pressure , or equation of state with @xmath5 that currently dominates the dynamics of the universe(see@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such a component makes up @xmath6 of the energy density of the universe yet remains elusive in the context of general relativity and the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the most natural dark energy candidate is a cosmological constant which arises as the result of a combination of general relativity(gr ) and quantum field theory .",
    "however , its theoretical value is between @xmath7 orders of magnitude higher than the observed value .",
    "an alternative candidate is a slowly evolving and spatially homogeneous scalar field , referred to as `` quintessence '' with @xmath8@xcite and `` phantom '' with @xmath9@xcite , respectively . since current observational constraint on the equation of state of dark energy lies in a relatively large around the so - called cosmological constant divide @xmath1 , it is still too early to rule out any of the above candidates .",
    "however , the expectation of explaining cosmological observations without requiring new energy component is undoubtedly worth of investigation .",
    "gr is very well examined in the solar system , in observation of the period of the binary pulsar , and in the early universe , via primordial nucleosynthesis , but no one has so far tested in the ultra - large length scales and low curvatures characteristic of the hubble radius today .",
    "therefore , it is a priori believable that friedmann equation is modified in the very far infrared , in such a way that the universe begins to accelerate at late time .",
    "freese and lewis@xcite construct so - called cardassian universe models that incarnates this hope .",
    "the cardassian universe is a proposed modification to the friedmann equation in which the universe is flat and accelerating , and yet contains only matter(baryonic or not ) and radiation .",
    "but the ordinary friedmann equation governing the expansion of the universe is modified to be @xmath10 where @xmath11 consists only of matter and radiation , @xmath12 is the hubble `` parameter '' which is a function of time , @xmath13 is the scale factor of the universe , and @xmath14 is the newtonian gravitational constant . note that as required by inflation scenario and observations of cmb , the geometry of the universe is flat , therefore , there are no curvature terms in the above equation .",
    "the function @xmath15 returns to ordinary friedmann equation at early times , but that takes a distinct form that drives an accelerated expansion in the recent past of the universe at @xmath16 . in cardassian models , we simply set the cosmological constant @xmath17 , and the only compositions are matter and radiation .",
    "a possible interpretation of cardassian arose from consideration of braneworld scenarios , in which our observable universe is a 3-dimensional brane embedded in a higher dimensional universe .",
    "an alternative interpretation had been also discussed@xcite , in which one developed a 4-dimensional fluid description of cardassian cosmology .",
    "the observational constraints of cardassian models have been extensively studied@xcite .",
    "the simplest model is power law cardassian modle(pl ) with an additional term @xmath18 , which satisfies many observational constrains : the first doppler peak of cmb is slightly shifted , the universe is rather older , and the early structure formation(@xmath19 ) is unaffected .",
    "furthermore , one can consider other forms of @xmath15 including the modified polytropic model(mp ) and the exponential model(exp ) @xmath20,&\\textrm{for pl}\\\\ \\rho\\left[1+\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{card}}{\\rho}\\right)^{qn}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{q } } ,   & \\textrm{for mp}\\\\   \\rho \\exp\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{card}}{\\rho}\\right)^{n}\\right ] , & \\textrm{for   exp }   \\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a characteristic constant energy density and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are two dimensionless positive constants@xcite .",
    "obviously , at early times , @xmath11 is much larger than the characteristic energy density @xmath21 , @xmath24 , i.e. eq.([modified frw eq ] ) recovers the ordinary friedmann equation .    on the other hand , the dissipative effects ,",
    "including both bulk and shear viscosity , are supposed to play a very important role in the astrophysics ( see ref . and references therein ) and the nuclear physics ( see ref . and references therein ) . under the conditions of spatial homogeneity and isotropy ,",
    "a scalar bulk viscous pressure is the solely admissible dissipative phenomenon .",
    "the viscosity theory of relativistic fluids was first suggested by eckart@xcite and landau and lifshitz@xcite , who considered only first - order deviation from equilibrium , which leads to parabolic differential equations and hence to an infinite speed of propagation for heat flow and viscosity , in contradiction with the principle of causality .",
    "the relativistic second - order theory was founded by israel@xcite , and has also been used in the evolution of the universe@xcite .",
    "however , the character of the evolution equation is very complicated in the framework of the full causal theory .",
    "therefore , the conventional theory@xcite is still applied to phenomena which are quasi - stationary , i.e. , slowly varying on space and time scales characterized by the mean free path and the mean collision time . in the case of isotropic and homogeneous cosmologies",
    ", the dissipative process can be modelled as a bulk viscosity @xmath25 within a thermodynamical approach .",
    "some original works on the bulk viscous cosmology were done by belinsky and khalatnikov@xcite .",
    "the bulk viscosity introduces dissipation by only redefining the effective pressure , @xmath26 , according to @xmath27 where @xmath12 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the condition @xmath28 assures a positive entropy production in conformity with the second law of thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "we are interested in two solvable cases : ( i ) @xmath29 , where @xmath4 is a constant .",
    "this assumption implicates that @xmath25 is directly proportional to the divergence of the cosmic fluid s velocity vector .",
    "therefore , it is physically natural , and has been considered previously in an astrophysical context@xcite ; ( ii ) @xmath30 .",
    "this dependence is more complicated , but one can see in the following some interesting results obtained .",
    "obviously , case ( i ) is equivalent to one with @xmath31 of case ( ii ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a viscous cardassian cosmological model for the expanding universe , assuming that there is bulk viscosity in the cosmic fluid .",
    "the dynamical analysis indicates that there exists a singular curve in the phase diagram for various models .",
    "the numerical result show that @xmath3 is increasingly large when the bulk viscosity is increasing .",
    "furthermore , we fit the viscous cardassian models to current sneia data and give the best fit values of the parameters including the bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath4 .",
    "in the viscous cardassian model , the modified friedmann equation is described by eq.([modified frw eq ] ) . for the late - time evolution of the universe we neglect the contribution of radiation ,",
    "so that eq.([modified frw eq ] ) is reduced to @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy density of matter , which keeps conserved during the expansion of the universe , i.e. , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the bulk viscosity for the matter energy density @xmath33 . in the @xmath36 case",
    ", the evolution of matter takes the ordinary manner @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the present value of energy density of matter .",
    "however , the evolution of matter is not likely power law of @xmath39 in the @xmath40 case .",
    "similarly , the conservation equation of total energy density can be written as @xmath41=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the bulk viscosity for total energy density @xmath42 .",
    "combing eqs.([matter energy conservation eq ] ) and ( [ total energy conservation eq ] ) , it is easy to check that @xmath43 . following ref . , we take the energy density to be the sum of two terms : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a cardassian contribution .",
    "the thermodynamics of an adiabatically expanding universe tell us that pressure of cardassian contribution is @xmath46 and @xmath47 because of @xmath48 . from eqs.([two terms ] ) and ( [ card pressure ] ) , we have the equation of state @xmath49 furthermore , we have @xmath50\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the acceleration equation of the cosmological expansion . using eqs.([card frw eq]),([total energy conservation eq ] ) and ( [ card pressure ] ) ,",
