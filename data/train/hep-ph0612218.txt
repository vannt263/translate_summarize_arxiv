    "adding an extra u(1)@xmath10 broken gauge symmetry to the gauge symmetries of the standard model is well motivated by grand unified theories @xcite . the corresponding supersymmetric extension that generalizes the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) often appears as the low energy effective theory of superstring theories @xcite .",

    "this is the same mechanism employed by the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite .",
    "however , the ussm possesses an additional advantage by avoiding the extra discrete symmetries of the nmssm that , in the canonical version , result in the existence of domain - walls that are incompatible with the observed energy density of the universe .",
    "moreover , the upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson of the mssm is relaxed in the ussm due to contributions from the new singlet - doublet higgs interactions and the u(1)@xmath10 @xmath13-terms @xcite .",

    "the usual mssm yukawa terms @xmath20 of the mssm superpotential ( _ i.e. _ without the @xmath11 term ) are augmented by an additional term that couples the iso - singlet to the two iso - doublet higgs fields : @xmath21 the coupling @xmath22 is dimensionless .",
    "gauge invariance of the superpotential @xmath23 under u(1)@xmath10 requires the u(1)@xmath10 charges to satisfy @xmath24 and corresponding relations between the u(1)@xmath10 charges of higgs and matter fields .",

    "+    the supersymmetric particle spectrum of the ussm has received limited attention so far in the literature @xcite . in this report",
    "we attempt a systematic analytical analysis of the neutralino system , based on the well - motivated assumption of weak coupling between the original mssm and the new additional gaugino / higgsino subsystem .",
    "in contrast to the mssm where exact solutions of the mass spectrum and mixing parameters can be constructed mathematically in closed form ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this is not possible anymore for the supersymmetric u(1)@xmath10 model in which the eigenvalue equation for the masses is a 6th order polynomial equation . however , analogously to the nmssm @xcite , if the mass scales of the supersymmetric particles are set by higgsino and gaugino parameters of the order the supersymmetry ( susy)-breaking scale , @xmath28  gev ) , while the interaction between the new singlet and the mssm fields is of the order of the electroweak scale , @xmath29  gev ) , then the perturbative expansion of the solution in @xmath30 provides an excellent approximation to the mass spectrum and yields a good understanding of the main features of the mixing matrix .",
    "+    once the masses and mixings are determined , the couplings of the neutralinos to the electroweak gauge bosons and to the scalar / fermionic matter particles are fixed .",
    "decay widths and production rates can subsequently be predicted for squark cascades at the lhc @xcite and pair production in @xmath0 collisions at linear colliders @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are the radiative transitions between neutralinos in cross - over zones , where the masses of two neutralinos are nearly degenerate .",
    "+    the report is organized as follows . in sect.@xmath31[sec : sec2 ] we first describe the general basis of the neutralino sector in the ussm .",
    "subsequently , for the naturally expected weak coupling between the mssm and the new subsystem , the properties of the new higgsino and gaugino are derived in sect.@xmath31[sec : sec3 ] .",
    "it is shown to what extent the properties of the standard neutralinos are modified . the spectrum and the mixings",
    "are determined analytically in a weak - coupling perturbative expansion .",
    "the neutralino masses are determined to second - order , whereas the mixing matrix elements are determined to first - order in the weak coupling .",
    "the accuracy of the perturbative results will become apparent by comparing the analytic approximations with the numerical solutions , thereby demonstrating that a satisfactory understanding of the system can be achieved .",
    "as an illustration we will study the limit in which the gaugino mass parameters are significantly larger than the higgsino mass parameters , where both sets of parameters are assumed to be much larger than the electroweak scale . a general description of the neutralino couplings and decay widths is given in sect.@xmath31[sec : sec4 ] , including photon transitions .",
    "we also discuss production cross sections in @xmath0 collisions and cascade decay chains of squarks at the lhc that involve neutralinos .",

    "the transformation alters the u(1)@xmath42u(1)@xmath10 part of the covariant derivative to @xmath43 the choice of the kinetic mixing matrix in the form given by eq.@xmath31([kinmixmatrix ] ) is motivated by the fact that the hypercharge sector of the standard model is left unaltered by this transformation , and the new effects are separated in the @xmath44 sector ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "<S> production channels in cascade decays at the lhc and pair production at @xmath0 colliders are also discussed .    </S>",
