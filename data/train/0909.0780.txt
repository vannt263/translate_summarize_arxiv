    "ideal hydrodynamics is very successful in describing experimental data at the relativistic heavy ion collider .",
    "ideal hydrodynamics requires local thermal equilibrium .",
    "the ideal hydrodynamics equations are valid for systems with at least local isotropy .",
    "it is very interesting to study the equilibration process to get a more detailed understanding of when and how much thermal equilibration can be achieved in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the isotropization process has been studied with the ampt model @xcite .",
    "in particular , the pressure anisotropy , i.e. , the longitudinal to transverse pressure ratio , is used to measure isotropization in the central cell in central heavy ion collisions .",
    "the string melting model is seen to give faster isotropization than the default model due to more partons in the initial stage . as the parton - parton cross section increases , isotropization increases .",
    "the pressure anisotropy crosses one at late times when transverse expansion sets in .",
    "the current ampt has fixed partonic cross sections and only two to two partonic processes . in order to go beyond the current ampt description ,",
    "we introduce the medium dependent cross sections and particle number changing processes .",
    "the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) cross section is taken to be the pqcd cross section regulated by a debye - screening mass .",
    "it is inversely proportional to the screening mass squared .",
    "the screening mass depends on the medium locally and is related to the density of particles . as the density increases , the screening mass increases , and the cross section decreases .",
    "the @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) cross section is taken to be one - half of the @xmath5 cross section , consistent with a more sophisticated calculation from xu and greiner .",
    "the @xmath8 reaction integral is determined from detailed balance to ensure correct chemical equilibration .",
    "isotropic cross sections will be used and should be reasonable for the dense central region of a collision .    with this radiative transport , chemical and kinetic equilibrations can be studied .",
    "the evolutions of collision rates are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : box_rate ] beginning with @xmath9 particles in a box of @xmath10 @xmath11 with a temperature of @xmath1 gev and coupling constant @xmath12 .",
    "the initial @xmath7 rate is large than @xmath8 rate and there will be particle production .",
    "as time goes on , these two rates converge toward the rate in chemical equilibrium .",
    "it is interesting to see whether kinetic equilibrium is maintained throughout the chemical equilibration process .",
    "[ fig : box_ene ] shows that the energy distribution deviates from an exponential distribution at early times . in particular , at @xmath13 fm/@xmath3 ,",
    "low energy part is closer to the final equilibrium value .",
    "the system relaxes toward the final thermodynamics equilibrium and at time @xmath14 fm/@xmath3 , it is very close to the expected distribution with chemical and kinetic equilibrium .",
    "kinetic equilibration during the early stage of a heavy ion collision can be studied with the radiative transport model @xcite .",
    "we will start with either initial isotropic or initial transverse distribution .",
    "the initial particle distributions are all exponential .",
    "two initial energy densities @xmath15 gev/@xmath11 will be used .",
    "the former corresponds to an initial temperature of @xmath16 gev for the isotropic initial conditions , while the latter corresponds to @xmath1 gev .",
    "two values are used for the strong interaction coupling constant @xmath17 .",
    "[ fig : bj_plopt ] shows the pressure anisotropy ratio evolutions . with isotropic initial conditions , @xmath18 first decreases due to",
    "the influence of longitudinal expansion then increases as thermalization wins over expansion .",
    "in contrast to the case with only @xmath5 collisions , instead of the @xmath19 scaling , there is an approximate @xmath0 scaling .",
    "furthermore , the transverse initial condition case has the same asymptotic evolution as the isotropic initial condition case . in other words , the memory of the initial pressure anisotropy",
    "is lost after some relaxation time .",
    "as the initial energy density increases or as the coupling constant increases , the pressure anisotropy goes closer to one and there is more thermalization and more memory loss of initial conditions .",
    "the energy density evolutions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bj_ene ] .",
    "this is for the high initial energy density case , similar results are obtained for the low initial energy density case .",
    "[ fig : bj_ene ] shows that the energy density evolution at very early times is determined by the initial pressure anisotropy and the late time evolution is determined by final state interactions .",
    "in particular , we observe that the evolutions are bounded by @xmath20 for the free streaming case and @xmath21 when @xmath22 .",
    "this falls a little short of the ideal hydro @xmath23 behavior and shows that viscosity is important in the longitudinal expansion stage .",
