    ". moreover , there are evidences that the high-@xmath3 cuprates have singlet @xmath2-wave cooper pairs and the gap parameter has @xmath9 symmetry in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of penetration depth @xmath10 @xcite and superconducting specific heat at different temperatures @xmath11 @xcite and related theoretical analyses @xcite also support this point of view . according to the isotropic @xmath0-wave bcs theory , as @xmath12",
    ", both observables exhibit exponential dependence on @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the experimental power - law dependence of these observables on @xmath11 can be explained by considering anisotropic gap parameter with node(s ) on the fermi surface in higher partial wave @xcite .",
    "it seems that some properties of the high-@xmath3 cuprates can be explained by the @xmath2-wave bcs equation in two dimensions for weak coupling .",
    "yet there has been no systematic study of the bcs equation in non-@xmath0 waves in two dimensions .",
    "the bcs theory considers @xmath13 electrons of spacing @xmath14 , interacting via a weak potential of short range @xmath15 such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the pair radius .",
    "when suitably scaled , most properties of the system should be insensitive to the details of the potential and be universal functions of the dimensionless variable @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the usual bcs treatment @xcite employs a phonon - induced two - electron potential of moderate range . in this paper",
    "we study the weak - coupling bcs problem in two dimensions for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 waves with two objectives in mind .",
    "the first objective is to identify the universal nature of the solution and its relation to to high-@xmath3 superconductors .",
    "the second objective is to find out to what extent the universal nature of the solution is modified in the presence of realistic finite - range ( nonlocal separable ) potentials . instead of solving the bcs equation on the lattice with appropriate symmetry",
    ", we solved the equations in the continuum .",
    "this procedure should suffice for present objectives .    in place of the phonon - induced bcs model we employ a renormalized bcs model with separable potential which has certain advantage .",
    "the renormalized bcs model leads to convergent result even in the absence of potential form factors or momentum / energy cut off , as required in the standard bcs model .",
    "the original bcs model yields a linear correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath20 , where @xmath20 is the debye temperature .",
    "this correlation was fundamental in explaining the observed isotope effect in conventional superconductors .",
    "the high-@xmath3 materials exhibit an anomalously negligible isotope effect and a linear correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath21 , where @xmath21 is the fermi temperature .",
    "this suggests a different interaction for superconductivity in the high-@xmath3 materials .",
    "the present renormalized model yields a linear scaling between @xmath3 and @xmath21 .",
    "because of this scaling with @xmath21 , unlike in the phonon - induced bcs model , the present @xmath3 can be large and appropriate for the high-@xmath3 cuprates in the weak coupling region .",
    "the present model also produces an appropriate @xmath22 ratio and a small @xmath23 in the weak coupling region in accord with recent experiments @xcite on high-@xmath3 cuprates . in spite of these we are aware that there are controversies in the description of the high-@xmath3 materials , for example , the microscopic hamiltonian and the pairing mechanism",
    "also , the normal state away from @xmath3 seems to be very different from a standard fermi liquid .",
    "however , we find that there are certain characteristics of these high-@xmath3 materials which can be studied within the present renormalized mean - field bcs model based on the standard fermi liquid theory .",
    "previously , there have been studies of this problem in two dimensions in terms of two - body binding in vacuum and cooper pair binding employing short- and zero - range potentials @xcite .",
    "such studies have not fully revealed the universal nature of the solution . in the present paper",
    "we employ the zero - temperature condensation energy per particle , @xmath24 , of the bcs condensate as the reference variable for studying the bcs problem .",
    "as the condensation energy increases , one passes from the weak to medium coupling . also , @xmath24 is a physical observable and is the appropriate reference variable as we shall see . in this paper",
    "we calculate the zero - temperature gap parameter @xmath25 , the critical temperature @xmath3 and the specific heat per particle @xmath26 in all partial waves ( denoted by angular momentum @xmath27 ) and the zero - temperature pair size in @xmath0 wave .",
    "we find that these observables obey robust universal scaling as functions of @xmath24 valid over several decades in the weak to medium coupling region independent of the potential range parameter .    here",
    ", we also calculate the temperature dependence of different quantities , such as , the gap parameter @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath10 and thermal conductivity @xmath30 for @xmath31 . of these , the @xmath11 dependence of @xmath29 , @xmath10 and @xmath30 are specially interesting . for isotropic @xmath0 wave , the bcs theory yields exponential dependence on temperature as @xmath32 for these observables independent of space dimension @xcite .",
    "the observed power - law dependence of some these observables can be explained with anisotropic gap parameter in non-@xmath0 waves with node on the fermi surface .",
    "we find universal power - law dependence in both cases for non-@xmath0 waves independent of the range of potential . for @xmath33",
    "we find @xmath34 and @xmath35 valid for almost the entire range of temperature .",
    "the suffix @xmath36 and @xmath0 refer to normal and superconducting states , respectively .",
    "similar dependence was predicted from an analysis of experimental data @xcite as well as from a calculation based on eliashberg equation @xcite . in order to detect the anisotropy in @xmath28",
    "it is appropriate to consider the function @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we find that for small @xmath11 it behaves as @xmath38 .",
    "similar power - law dependence was conjectured before @xcite .    from the weak - coupling bcs equation we establish the following relations analytically : @xmath393.528 ( 3.026 ) , @xmath25 = @xmath40 ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 1.134@xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 1.43 ( 1.05 ) , @xmath45 9.065@xmath42 ( 8.915@xmath46 ) , @xmath47 0.473 ( 0.348 ) , for @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",

    "we present the renormalized bcs model . in section 3",
    "we present an account of our numerical study .",
    "finally , in section 4 we present a brief summary of our findings .",
    "the two - body problem , cooper and bcs models all exhibit ultraviolet divergences for zero range potential and require regularization or renormalization to produce finite results @xcite .",

    "this implies a moderate range of the interaction . this potential is a physically motivated phonon induced electron - electron one @xcite .",
    "the present renormalized bcs equation may lead to well - defined solution without requiring a cut off even in the absence of potential form factors .",
