    "at present a number of powerful techniques based on operator product expansion ( ope ) and effective field theories have been developed .",
    "these tools allow one consistently to include into consideration various nonperturbative contributions , written in terms of a few number of universal quantities .",
    "the coefficients ( wilson coefficients ) in front of these operators are generally expanded in series over the qcd coupling constant , inverse heavy quark mass and/or relative velocity of heavy quarks inside the hadron . the accuracy , obtained in such calculations , can be systematically improved , and it is limited only by the convergence properties of the mentioned series . the described approach",
    "have been already widely used for making the precise predictions in the heavy quark sector of standard model ( sm ) , such as decays , distributions and partial width asymmetries involving the cp violation for the heavy hadrons .",
    "the sensitivity of wilson coefficients to virtual corrections caused by some higher - scale interactions makes this approach to be invaluable in searching for a `` new '' physics at forthcoming experiments .",
    "the approach under discussion has been successfully used in the description of weak decays of the hadrons containing a single heavy quark , as carried out in the framework of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite , in the annihilation and radiative decays of heavy quarkonia @xmath4 , where one used the framework of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite , and in the weak decays of long - lived heavy quarkonium with mixed flavours @xmath5 @xcite .- meson was recently reported by the cdf collaboration @xcite ; see ref.@xcite for a theoretical review of @xmath6-meson physics before the observation . ]",
    "the experimental data on the weak decays of heavy hadrons can be used for the determination of basic properties of weak interactions at a fundamental level , in particular , for the extraction of ckm matrix elements .",
    "the same approach is also valid for the baryons containing two heavy quarks .",
    "in addition to the information extracted from the analysis of hadrons with a single heavy flavor , the baryons with two heavy quarks , @xmath7 , provide a way to explore the nonspectator effects , where their importance is increased . here",
    "we would like to note , that in the case of systems with two heavy quarks , the hypothesis on the quark - hadron duality is more justified , and , so , the results of ope - based approach turn out to be more reliable . for these baryons",
    "we can apply a method , based on the combined hqet - nrqcd techniques @xcite , if we use the quark - diquark picture for the bound states .",
    "the expansion in the inverse heavy quark mass for the heavy diquark @xmath8 is a straightforward generalization of these techniques in the mesonic decays of @xmath6 @xcite , with the difference that , instead of the color - singlet systems , we deal with the color  anti - triplet ones , with the appropriate account for the interaction with the light quark .",
    "first estimates of the lifetimes for the doubly heavy baryons @xmath9 and @xmath10 were recently performed in @xcite .",
    "using the same approach , but different values of parameters a repetition of our results for the case of doubly charmed baryons was done in @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic characteristics of baryons with two heavy quarks and the mechanisms of their production in different interactions were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .    in this paper",
    ", we present the calculation of lifetimes for the doubly heavy baryons as well as reconsider the previous estimates with a use of slightly different set of parameters adjusted in the consideration of lifetime data for the observed heavy hadrons and improved spectroscopic inputs . as we made in the description of inclusive decays of the @xmath9 and @xmath10-baryons ,",
    "we follow the papers @xcite , where all necessary generalizations to the case of hadrons with two heavy quarks and other corrections are discussed .",
    "we note , that in the leading order of ope expansion , the inclusive widths are determined by the mechanism of spectator decays involving free quarks , wherein the corrections in the perturbative qcd are taken into account .",
    "the introduction of subleading terms in the expansion over the inverse heavy quark masses - correction is absent , and the corrections begin with the @xmath11-terms . ]",
    "allows one to take into account the corrections due to the quark confinement inside the hadron . here , an essential role is played by both the motion of heavy quark inside the hadron and chromomagnetic interactions of quarks .",
    "the important ingredient of such corrections in the baryons with two heavy quarks is the presence of a compact heavy diquark , which implies that the square of heavy quark momentum is enhanced in comparison with the corresponding value for the hadrons with a single heavy quark .",
    "the next characteristic feature of baryons with two heavy quarks is the significant numerical impact on the lifetimes by the quark contents of hadrons , since in the third order over the inverse heavy quark mass , @xmath12 , the four - quark correlations in the total width are enforced in the effective lagrangian due to the two - particle phase space of intermediate states ( see the discussion in @xcite ) . in this situation , we have to add the effects of pauli interference between the products of heavy quark decays and the quarks in the initial state as well as the weak scattering involving the quarks composing the hadron .",
    "due to such terms we introduce the corrections depending on spectators and involving the masses of light and strange quarks in the framework of non - relativistic models with the constituent quarks , because they determine the effective physical phase spaces , strongly deviating from the naive estimates in th decays of charmed quarks .",
    "we take into account the corrections to the effective weak lagrangian due to the evolution of wilson coefficients from the scale of the order of heavy quark mass to the energy , characterizing the binding of quarks inside the hadron @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in agreement with the general picture given above",
    ", we describe the scheme for the construction of ope for the total width of baryons containing two heavy quarks with account of corrections to the spectator widths in section 2 .",
    "the procedure for the estimation of non - perturbative matrix elements of operators in the doubly heavy baryons is considered in section 3 in terms of non - relativistic heavy quarks .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the numerical evaluation and discussion of parameter dependence of lifetimes of doubly heavy baryons .",
    "we conclude in section 5 by summarizing our results .",
    "in this section we describe the approach used for the calculation of total lifetimes for the doubly heavy baryons , originally formulated in @xcite , together with some new formulae , required for the evaluation of nonspectator effects in the decays of other baryons in the family of doubly heavy baryons , not considered previously .",
    "the optical theorem along with the hypothesis of integral quark - hadron duality , leads us to a relation between the total decay width of heavy quark and the imaginary part of its forward scattering amplitude .",
    "this relationship , applied to the @xmath13-baryon total decay width @xmath14 , can be written down as : @xmath15 where the @xmath13 state in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) has the ordinary relativistic normalization , @xmath16 , and the transition operator @xmath17 is determined by the expression @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the standard effective hamiltonian , describing the low energy interactions of initial quarks with the decays products , so that @xmath20 + h.c.\\ ] ] where @xmath21[\\bar q_{3\\gamma}\\gamma^{\\nu}(1-\\gamma_5)q_{4\\delta}](\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\delta _ { \\gamma\\delta}\\pm\\delta_{\\alpha\\delta}\\delta_{\\gamma\\beta}),\\ ] ] and @xmath22^{\\frac{6}{33 - 2f } } , \\quad c_- = \\left [ \\frac{\\alpha_s(m_w)}{\\alpha_s(\\mu)}\\right ] ^{\\frac{-12}{33 - 2f}},\\\\\\ ] ] where f is the number of flavors , @xmath23 run over the color indeces .    under an assumption , that the energy release in the heavy quark decay is large , we can perform the operator product expansion for the transition operator @xmath17 in eq.([1 ] ) . in this way we obtain series of local operators with increasing dimensions over the energy scale , wherein the contributions to @xmath14 are suppressed by the increasing inverse powers of the heavy quark masses .",
    "this formalism has already been applied to calculate the total decay rates for the hadrons , containing a single heavy quark @xcite ( for the most early work , having used similar methods , see also @xcite ) and hadrons , containing two heavy quarks @xcite . as was already pointed in @xcite ,",
    "the expansion , applied here , is simultaneously in the powers of both inverse heavy quark masses and the relative velocity of heavy quarks inside the hadron .",
    "thus , this fact shows the difference between the description for the doubly heavy baryons and the consideration of both the heavy - light mesons ( the expansion in powers of @xmath24 ) and the heavy - heavy mesons @xcite ( the expansion in powers of relative velocity of heavy quarks inside the hadron , where one can apply the scaling rules of nonrelativistic qcd @xcite ) .",
    "the operator product expansion explored has the form : @xmath25    the leading contribution in eq.([4 ] ) is determined by the operators @xmath26 , corresponding to the spectator decay of @xmath27-quarks .",
    "the use of motion equation for the heavy quark fields allows one to eliminate some redundant operators , so that no operators of dimension four contribute .",
    "there is a single operator of dimension five , @xmath28 .",
    "as we will show below , significant contributions come from the operators of dimension six @xmath29 , representing the effects of pauli interference and weak scattering for doubly heavy baryons . furthermore , there are also other operators of dimension six @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which are suppressed in comparison with @xmath32 @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we do not calculate the corresponding coefficient functions for the latter two operators , so that the expansion is certainly complete up to the second order of @xmath33 , only .",
    "further , the different contributions to ope are given by the following : @xmath34 where the @xmath35-labelled terms account for the operators of dimension three @xmath36 and five @xmath37 , the @xmath38-marked terms correspond to the effects of pauli interference and weak scattering .",
    "the explicit formulae for these contributions have the following form : @xmath39o_{gb } , \\label{5}\\ ] ] @xmath40o_{gc } , \\label{6}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 with @xmath42 , and @xmath43 denotes the spectator width ( see @xcite ) : @xmath44 @xmath45 + 12r^2y^2\\ln\\frac{(1-r - y+\\sqrt{1 - 2(r+y)+(r - y)^2})^2}{4ry}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "theoretical accuracy can be improved by the calculation of next - order corrections in the powers of qcd coupling constant .",
    "the coefficients of leading terms , represented by operators @xmath67 and @xmath68 , are equivalent to the widths fot the decays of free quarks and are known in the next - to - leading logarithmic approximation of qcd @xcite , including the mass corrections in the final state with the charmed quark and @xmath69-lepton @xcite in the decays of @xmath53-quark and with the strange quark mass for the decays of @xmath70-quark . in the numerical estimates , we include these corrections and mass effects , but we neglect the decay modes suppressed by the cabibbo angle , and also the strange quark mass effects in @xmath53 decays .",

    "now we would like to make some comments on the difference between the descriptions of interactions of the heavy quark with the light and heavy heavy ones . as well known , in the doubly heavy subsystem there is an additional parameter which is the relative velocity of quarks .",
    "it introduces the energy scale equal to @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , the darwin term ( @xmath84 ) in the heavy subsystem stands in the same order of inverse heavy quark mass in comparison with the chromomagnetic term ( @xmath85 ) ( they have the same power in the velocity @xmath86 ) .",
    "this statement becomes evident if we apply the scaling rules of nrqcd @xcite : @xmath87 for the interaction of heavy quark with the light one , there is no such small velocity parameter , so that the darwin term is suppressed by the additional factor of @xmath88 .",
