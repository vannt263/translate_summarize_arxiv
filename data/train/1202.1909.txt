    "in most practical scenarios , perfect channel state information at transmitter ( csit ) may not be available due to the time - varying nature of wireless channels as well as the limited resource for channel estimation .",
    "however , many wireless applications must guarantee high - data rate and reliable communication in the presence of channel uncertainty . in this paper",
    ", we consider such scenario in the context of the two - user miso broadcast channel , where the transmitter equipped with @xmath0 antennas wishes to send two private messages to two receivers each with a single antenna .",
    "the discrete time baseband signal model is given by    @xmath1    for any time instant @xmath2 , where @xmath3 are the channel vectors for user  1 and 2 , respectively ; @xmath4 are normalized additive white gaussian noise  ( awgn ) at the respective receivers ; the input signal @xmath5 is subject to the power constraint @xmath6 , @xmath7 . for the case of perfect csit ,",
    "the optimal multiplexing gain of the channel at hand is two achieved by linear strategies such as zero - forcing ( zf ) beamforming .",
    "it is also well known that the full multiplexing gain can be maintained under imperfect csit if the error in csit decreases at the rate @xmath8 as @xmath9 grows @xcite .",
    "further , in the realistic case where the fading process is correlated with a maximum doppler frequency shift @xmath10 , zf can achieve a fraction @xmath11 of the optimal multiplexing gain @xcite .",
    "this result somehow reveals the bottleneck of a family of precoding schemes relying only on instantaneous csit as the fading speed increases ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "recently , a breakthrough has been made in order to overcome precisely such a problem . in @xcite",
    ", maddah - ali and tse showed a surprising result that even completely outdated csit can be very useful in terms of multiplexing gain . for a system with @xmath13 antennas and two users , the proposed scheme , hereafter called mat , achieves the multiplexing gain of @xmath14 ,",
    "irrespectively of the fading speed .",
    "this work shifts the paradigm of broadcast precoding from space - only to space - time alignment .",
    "the role of delayed csit can then be re - interpreted as a `` feedback '' of the past signal / interference heard by the receiver .",
    "this side information enables the transmitter to perform `` retrospective '' alignment in the space _ and _ time domain , as demonstrated in different multiuser network systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although it exhibits optimal rate scaling behavior , the mat algorithm is designed based on the worst case scenario where the delayed channel feedback provides no information about the current one .",
    "this assumption is over pessimistic as most practical channels exhibit some form of temporal correlation .",
    "it should be noticed that mat does not exploit any current csit whereas zf builds only on the current csit .",
    "in fact with a simple selection strategy between zf and mat , a multiplexing gain of @xmath15 is achievable .",
    "for either very slowly or very rapidly varying channels , a scheme selection approach is reasonable . yet , for intermediate ranges of temporal correlation , a question arises as how to best exploit both past channel samples and an estimate of the current one , obtained through a linear prediction .    in order to model the quality of the current csit",
    ", we introduce a parameter @xmath16 which indicates the rate of decay of the channel estimation error when the transmitted power grows .",
    "thus @xmath17 and @xmath18 correspond to no and perfect csit respectively .",
    "we propose a seamless scheme which bridges smoothly between the two extremal schemes zf and mat and we characterize the achievable degrees of freedom .",
    "as it will be shown later , the proposed scheme combines the zf and mat principles into a single multi - slotted protocol which relies on the retransmission and alignement of the _ residual _ interference caused by the zf precoder due to the imperfectness of current channel state information .    in the following , after a brief presentation of the assumptions on the csi and fading process , we present the proposed scheme as an extension the mat principle",
    ". the achievable degrees of freedom ( dof ) of the proposed scheme are analyzed afterward .",
    "finally , we interpret the obbtained dof in a practical temporally correlated fading channel scenario where @xmath16 can be related to the maximum doppler shift over the time varying channel .    throughout the paper",
    ", we will use the following notations .",
    "matrix transpose , hermitian transpose , inverse , and determinant are denoted by @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "for any real number @xmath23 , @xmath24 $ ] means @xmath25 .",
    "for convenience , we provide the following definition on the channel states .",
    "the channel vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 are called the states of the channel at instant @xmath2 . for simplicity , we also define the state matrix @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "$ ]    the assumptions on the fading process and the knowledge of the channel states are summarized as follows .",
    "[ assumption : fading ] at any given time instant @xmath2 , the channel vectors for the two users @xmath30 are mutually independent and identically distributed  ( i.i.d . ) with zero mean and covariance matrix @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath32 with probability @xmath33 .    [ assumption : csi ] at each time instant @xmath2 , the transmitter knows the delayed channel states up to instant @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , the transmitter can somehow obtain an estimation @xmath35 of the current channel state @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are available to the transmitter with    [ mmse ] @xmath38    where the estimate @xmath36  ( also @xmath37 ) and estimation error @xmath39  ( also @xmath40 ) are uncorrelated and both assumed to be zero mean with covariance @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , with @xmath43 .",
    "the receivers knows perfectly @xmath28 and @xmath44 without delay .    without loss of generality",
    ", we can introduce a parameter @xmath45 as the power exponent of the estimation error @xmath46 the parameter @xmath16 can be regarded as the quality of the current csi in the high snr regime . note that @xmath47 corresponds to the case with no current csit at all while @xmath48 corresponds to the case with perfect current csit .",
    "in this section , we propose a novel scheme that combines zf exploiting some estimated current csit and mat exploiting delayed csit .",
    "we start by briefly reviewing the mat scheme .      in the two - user miso case ,",
    "the original mat is a three - slot scheme , described by the following equations    @xmath49^{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{t}}}\\label{eq : tmp201}\\\\    y_1 & = { { { \\lowercase{{\\bm{h}}}}}}_1^{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{t}}}{{{\\lowercase{{\\bm{u } } } } } } &     y_2 & = { { { \\lowercase{{\\bm{h}}}}}}_2^{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{t}}}{{{\\lowercase{{\\bm{v } } } } } } &     y_3 & = h_{31}({{{\\lowercase{{\\bm{g}}}}}}_1^{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{t}}}{{{\\lowercase{{\\bm{u}}}}}}+ { { { \\lowercase{{\\bm{h}}}}}}_2^{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{t}}}{{{\\lowercase{{\\bm{v } } } } } } )   \\\\",
    "z_1 & = { { { \\lowercase{{\\bm{g}}}}}}_1^{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{t}}}{{{\\lowercase{{\\bm{u } } } } } } &    z_2 & = { { { \\lowercase{{\\bm{g}}}}}}_2^{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{t}}}{{{\\lowercase{{\\bm{v } } } } } } &    z_3 & = g_{31}({{{\\lowercase{{\\bm{g}}}}}}_1^{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{t}}}{{{\\lowercase{{\\bm{u}}}}}}+ { { { \\lowercase{{\\bm{h}}}}}}_2^{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{t}}}{{{\\lowercase{{\\bm{v } } } } } } )     \\label{eq : tmp203 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 are useful signals to user  1 and user  2 , respectively ; for simplicity , we omit the noise in the received signals .",
    "the idea of the mat scheme is to use the delayed csit to align the mutual interference into a reduced subspace with only one dimension  ( @xmath51 for user 1 and @xmath52 for user 2 ) . and",
    "importantly , the reduction in interference is done without sacrificing the dimension of the useful signals .",
    "specifically , a two - dimensional interference - free observation of @xmath53  ( resp .",
    "@xmath54 ) is obtained at receiver  1  ( resp .  receiver  2 ) .",
    "interestingly , the alignment can be done in a different manner .",
    "_ 1 & = + & _ 2 & = [ _ 1 ^ 0 ] ^ & _ 3 & = [ _ 1 ^ 0 ] ^ & + y_1 & = _",
    "1^(+ ) & y_2 & = h_21_1^ & y_3 & = h_31_1^ + z_1 & = _",
    "1^(+ ) & z_2 & = g_21_1^ & z_3 & = g_31_1^    in the first slot , the transmitter sends the mixed signal to both users . in the second slot",
    ", the transmitter sends the interference seen by receiver 1 in the first slot .",
    "the role of this stage is two - fold : _ resolving interference for user  1 and reinforcing signal for user  2_. in the third slot , the transmitter sends the interference seen by user 2 to help the users the other way around .",
    "therefore , this variant of the mat alignment is composed of two phases : i )  broadcasting the mixed signal , and ii )  multicasting the mutual interference @xmath55 . at the end of three slots ,",
    "the observations at the receivers are given by @xmath56for each user , the useful signal lies in a two - dimensional subspace while the interference is aligned in a one - dimensional subspace .",
    "since the latter is not completely included in the signal subspace , it is readily shown that two degrees of freedom are achievable in the three - dimensional time space , yielding @xmath57 as the average degrees of freedom .",
    "this variant , although trivial from the original mat scheme , is crucial to the integration of the current csi , if there is any .      based on the above variant of the mat scheme , we propose the following two - stage scheme that integrates the estimates of the current csi .",
    "as in the above mat variant , we first mix the two signals as @xmath58 , except that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are precoded beforehand @xmath59where @xmath60 \\in      \\mathbb{c}^{m\\times 2}$ ] and @xmath61 \\in        \\mathbb{c}^{m\\times 2}$ ] are the precoding matrices ; @xmath62^{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{t}}}$ ] and @xmath63^{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{t}}}$ ] are input signals of dimension @xmath64 for user  1 and user  2 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that @xmath65 and @xmath66 are mutually independent . in this paper , we restrict ourselves to orthogonal precoders , i.e. , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in particular , we align @xmath69 and @xmath70 with the estimated channels @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "that is ,    [ nullspace ] @xmath73    let us define the covariance matrices @xmath74 and @xmath75 . without loss of generality , we can assume that both @xmath76 and @xmath77 are diagonal .",
    "hence , the power constraint is simply @xmath78 in other words , for each user , we send two streams in two orthogonal directions : one aligned with the estimated channel while the other one perpendicular to it .",
    "as the second phase of the mat variant , the objective of this phase is , by sending the mutual interferences @xmath55 seen at the receivers , to resolve the interference _ and _ to reinforce the useful signal at the same time . however , unlike the original mat scheme where the interferences @xmath79 is transmitted in an analog form , we will quantize it and then transmit the digital version . the rationale behind",
    "this choice is as follows . with ( imperfect )  csi on the current channel , the transmitter can use the precoding to align the signals and allocate the transmit power in such a way that the mutual interferences have a reduced power , without sacrificing too much the received signal power . as a result , we should be able to save the resource needed to multicast the interferences , which increases the average rate",
    ". the reduction can be significant when the current csi is good enough . in this case , the analog transmission is not suitable any more , due to the mismatch of the source power and available transmit power .",
    "therefore , a good alternative is to quantize the interferences before transmission .",
    "the number of quantization bits depends naturally on the interference power , which means that the multicasting can be done efficiently .",
    "let us look into the interferences by taking into account the precoding .",
    "we start by examining the interference @xmath80 seen by user  1 .",
    "it can be rewritten as @xmath81where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are known at the end of the first slot to both receivers , according to assumption  [ assumption : csi ] .",
    "therefore , the average power of @xmath84 is @xmath85 , i.e. , @xmath86similarly , for the interference seen by user  2 during the first slot @xmath87 , the average power is @xmath88obviously , the interference powers @xmath89 and @xmath90 depend on the both the precoder and the power allocation at the transmitter . the power allocation issue will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the first step is to quantize @xmath55 .",
    "although it is possible to apply directly a 2-dimensional quantizer , we choose to quantize both signals individually for simplicty of demonstration .",
    "let us assume that an @xmath91-bits scalar quantizer is used for @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath94where @xmath95 , @xmath96 , is a quantization codebook of size @xmath97 ; @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the quantized value and the quantization noise , respectively . the indices of both @xmath100 and @xmath101 , represented in @xmath102 bits , are then multicast to both users in @xmath103 channel uses .",
    "as will be specified in the next section , we choose @xmath103 such that the indices can be recovered with high probability .    at the receivers side ,",
    "each user first tries to recover @xmath104 .",
    "if this step is done successfully , then receiver  1 has @xmath105from which an equivalent @xmath106 mimo channel is obtained @xmath107 where the noise @xmath108^{{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathsf{t}}}$ ] is not gaussian and can depend on the signal in general ; the equivalent channel matrix is @xmath109 .",
    "similarly , if receiver  2 can recover @xmath104 correctly , then the following term is available @xmath110 in order to finally recover the message , each user performs the mimo decoding of the above equivalent channel .",
    "in this section , we analyze the achievable rate of the proposed scheme in the high snr regime . in particular , we are interested in the pre - log factor of the achievable rate , the so - called degrees of freedom  ( dof ) . however , since we do not assume ergodic fading process in this work , we do not use directly ergodic capacity as our performance measure . instead ,",
    "following the definition of multiplexing gain in @xcite , we define the achievable degrees of freedom as follows .    for a family of codes @xmath111 of length @xmath112 and rate @xmath113 bits per channel use ,",
    "we let @xmath114 be the average probability of error and define @xmath115 then , the achievable degrees of freedom of @xmath116 is defined as @xmath117    in other words , the dof defined in this work is the maximum pre - log factor of the rate of a coding scheme for a reliable communication in the high snr regime . note that the code length @xmath112 here is fixed , which avoids the involvement of the whole fading process .    in the following ,",
    "we focus on the symmetrical case where the two users have the same data rate .",
    "the whole achievable region is straightforward following the same lines .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath118 exists and define @xmath119the main result is stated in the following theorem .    [",
    "theorem : betterdof ] in the two - user miso broadcast channel with delayed perfect csit and imperfect current csit  ( assumption [ assumption : csi ] ) , the following dof is achievable for each user @xmath120 \\\\ 1 , & \\alpha > 1 .",
    "\\end{dcases } \\label{eq : d1d2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that when @xmath16 is close to @xmath121 , the estimation of current csit is bad and therefore useless . in this case , the optimal scheme is mat  @xcite , achieving dof of @xmath57 for each user . on the other hand , when @xmath122 , the estimation is good and the interference at the receivers due to the imperfect estimation is below the noise level and thus can be neglected as far as the dof is concerned . in this case , zf with the estimated current csi is asymptotically optimal , achieving degrees of freedom @xmath33 for each user .",
    "interestingly , our result  ( fig .  ) reveals that strictly larger dof than @xmath123 can be obtained by exploiting both the imperfect current csit and the perfect delayed csit in an intermediate regime @xmath124 .",
    "the intuition behind equation   is as follows .",
    "decreasing the interference power will reduce the receive power of useful signal , incurring a loss of degrees of freedom . on the other hand , decreasing the interference power",
    "will also save the resources needed to communicate the interference _ a la _ mat . by smartly aligning the signals and allocating the transmit power ,",
    "the proposed scheme loses only @xmath16  ( numerator in ) degrees of freedom , but reduces @xmath125 channel uses  ( denominator in ) .",
    "the rest of the section is devoted to the proof of the theorem .",
    "some important ingredients of the proposed scheme are :    * two independent gaussian codebooks @xmath126 and",
    "@xmath127 with same size @xmath128 are used for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . *",
    "since we are interested in the symmetrical case , same power allocation scheme is applied to both user , i.e. , @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath131 . *",
    "truncated uniform quantization with unit step and truncation value @xmath132 , for some @xmath133 , is used for both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath84 and @xmath134 , i.e. , @xmath135 +        i\\,\\left [ \\text{trunc } ( { \\ifthenelse{\\isempty{\\eta_k}}{\\operatorname{im}}{\\operatorname{im}\\left(\\eta_k\\right ) } } ) \\right ]      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath136 if @xmath137 $ ] and @xmath121 otherwise . *",
    "the double indices of @xmath104 , represented in @xmath138 are sent with a multicast code .",
    "we define the error event @xmath139 as the event that one of the users can not recover his message correctly .",
    "it can be shown that this event implies one of the following events :    * quantization range error @xmath140 : the amplitude of real or imaginary parts of interferences is out of @xmath141 $ ] ; * multicast error @xmath142 : one of the users can not recover the double indices of @xmath104 correctly ; * mimo decoding error @xmath143 : based on the received signal and the recovered indices , one of the users can not recover his original message after performing a mimo decoding of the equivalent channel   or  .",
    "that is , @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath145 in the following , we examine the individual error events .",
    "this event is the union of the four events : @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 .",
