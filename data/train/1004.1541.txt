    "an especially relevant subject is quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "most experimental studies of fluctuations concentrated on systems of cold atoms in double well @xcite and optical lattice potentials @xcite . in the former system",
    "squeezed states were predicted and produced , with particle number fluctuations ( i.e. uncertainties of populations of the potential wells ) turning from poissonian to sub - poissonian @xcite .",
    "the latter system reveals a superfluid to mott insulator transition @xcite with enhanced phase fluctuations but with decreasing particle number fluctuations .    in the present paper we focus on a system where",
    "the total particle number is fixed but occupation of certain single particle states reveals considerable quantum fluctuations .",
    "we are interested in a system where the mean field theory predicts symmetry breaking @xcite and the symmetry broken solutions are degenerated and form a hilbert subspace parameterized by a continuous parameter . if the occupation of single particle states varies a lot as we move in the degenerate subspace than huge particle number fluctuations can be expected in the exact quantum many body eigenstates .",
    "degenerate subspace parameterized by a continuous parameter appears in spin-1 bose gas with an anti - ferromagnetic interaction @xcite or in scalar condensates with solitonic solutions @xcite .",
    "attractive single component bose gas in a symmetric double well potential reveals also huge particle number fluctuations but it constitutes a slightly different example @xcite .",
    "there the degeneracy is small , i.e. the degenerate subspace is two dimensional , and the particle number fluctuations correspond to random localization of all particles in one of the potential wells in different experimental realizations . in all these examples",
    "the correct mean field theory reduces to the gross - pitaevskii equations @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we consider a bose gas system where the gross - pitaevskii equation is not a correct mean - field description , that is , a two - component bose gas in a double - well potential in the strong interaction limit .    in sec .",

    "the hamiltonian of a two component bose gas in a symmetric double well potential , in the tight binding approximation , takes the form of the bose - hubbard model @xmath0 where we have assumed that intra - species interactions are the same in both gas components and they are characterized by a coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 is a coupling constant that describes inter - species interactions while @xmath3 stands for the tunneling rate between the two potential wells .",
    "we assume also that numbers of particles of each component are equal to @xmath4 .",
    "such a choice of the system parameters allows us to perform fully analytical calculations .",
    "analysis of a general case is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ oneh ] ) can be transformed to @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and constant terms have been omitted . in the following we consider @xmath8 as the unit of energy .",
    "we are interested in the strong interaction limit .",
    "therefore , the tunneling part of the hamiltonian will be considered as a small perturbation . for @xmath9",
    "the system hamiltonian has exact eigenstates @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 refer to numbers of particles of the component @xmath13 in the first and the second potential well , respectively , and similarly for the component @xmath14 .",

    "matrix elements of the tunneling part of the hamiltonian are zero between states of the same manifold . however , this part of the hamiltonian introduces couplings between different manifolds . in an effective hamiltonian that describes the lowest manifold of the system",
    "the effect of the coupling can be included via the second order perturbation theory .",
    "a compact form of the effective hamiltonian may be obtained if we introduce spin operators s_jx&=&12(a^_jb_j+b_j^a_j ) , s_jy&=&-(a^_jb_j - b_j^a_j ) , s_jz&=&12(a^_ja_j - b_j^b_j ) .",

    "note that eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) depend on two parameters only , i.e. @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "let us analyze the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) [ in the manifold defined in ( [ condition ] ) ] in the classical limit by substituting the spin operators by classical angular momentum components .",
    "the condition ( [ condition ] ) implies that @xmath36 .",
    "we are interested in the ground state of the system .",
    "the value of the tunneling part of the hamiltonian -2j^2*s*_1_2 = -2j^2(s_1xs_2x + s_1ys_2y + s_1zs_2z ) , is minimal for @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "for @xmath39 the ground state corresponds to @xmath40 which can be related to @xmath41 ( i.e. phase separation occurs where different gas components occupy different potential wells ) .",
    "for @xmath42 the @xmath43-components of the angular momenta disappear in the ground state ( @xmath44 ) which corresponds to @xmath45 ( i.e. equal mixture of both components in each potential well ) . when @xmath46 we deal with the transition point where @xmath47 can be arbitrary provided @xmath48 .",
    "then all values of @xmath21 are equally probable ( any mixture of both components in each potential well is equally likely ) .",
    "the transition between the phase separation and miscible regimes is discontinuous .",
    "the analysis of the classical limit suggests that huge particle number fluctuations can be expected in the quantum ground state of the system at the transition point .",

    "the hamiltonian reads [ ham2 ] h_2=j^2[(s_1x - s_2x)^2+(s_1y - s_2y)^2 - _ 1 ^ 2 - _ 2 ^ 2 ] . applying the unitary ( rotation ) transformation @xmath50 which commutes with @xmath51 and thus leaves the manifold @xmath52 invariant , and defining the total spin operator , @xmath53 , we can rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) in the following form [ ham3 ] h_2=j^2(^2 -_1 ^ 2 - _ 2 ^ 2 ) . states @xmath54 with an integer @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is an eigenvalue of the @xmath57 operator and @xmath58 is an eigenvalue of the @xmath59 operator , are therefore eigenstates of our problem .",

    "it is interesting to note that we can construct the exact quantum ground state using the superposition of symmetry broken solutions obtained in the classical limit . at",
    "the transition point the classical analysis tells us that in the ground state the potential wells are associated with classical angular momenta where orientation of one is given by @xmath67 and the other one by @xmath68 and spherical angles @xmath69 and @xmath70 can be arbitrary .",
    "the best quantum approximation of a classical angular momentum is a coherent state @xcite |_j,_j&= & ( e^i_j/2 a_j^. & & .",

    "we see that at the transition point the classical analysis allows us to construct the exact ground state of the system .",
    "however , in the close vicinity of the transition point this analysis is not able to provide a good estimate for the ground state of the system .",
    "this is because the classical approach predicts discontinuous transition between the phase separation and miscible regimes but the transition is actually continuous .",
    "starting with the classical ground states and using the coherent states we can construct quantum ground states that depend on @xmath35 and on the sign of the parameter @xmath72 but not on its absolute value .",
    "however , the exact diagonalization indicates that there is a range of @xmath72 where the ground state changes continuously from the miscible to phase separation character . as one can expect this range shrinks with @xmath35 because differences between the classical and quantum angular momentum diminish in the large @xmath35 limit",

    "we have tested our predictions comparing them with exact numerical calculations .",

    "in summary , we have analyzed a strongly interacting two - component bose gas in a double well potential for parameters close to the transition point where the phase separation occurs .",
