    "we mention important properties of @xmath14 to be used in the definition of complete orthoschemes in the next section .",
    "first , every geodesic plane in @xmath14 is given as the intersection of a euclidean plane and @xmath14 .",
    "this is because every geodesic plane in @xmath21 is defined as the intersection of @xmath21 and a linear subspace of @xmath22 of dimension three , and a geodesic plane in @xmath14 is the image of that in @xmath21 by the radial projection .",
    "the projection @xmath55 thus gives a correspondence between points in the exterior of @xmath14 in @xmath62 and the geodesic planes of @xmath14 .",
    "we call @xmath64 for @xmath65 the _ pole _ of the plane @xmath66 or the geodesic plane @xmath67 .",
    "conversely , we call @xmath66 the _ polar plane _ of @xmath64 , and we call @xmath67 the _ polar geodesic planes _ of @xmath64 . if @xmath67 does not pass through the origin of @xmath14 , then its pole is given as the apex of a circular cone which is tangent to @xmath17 and has the base circle @xmath68 .",
    "the second important property is that , for a given geodesic plane , say @xmath69 , in @xmath14 , every plane or line which passes through the pole of @xmath69 is orthogonal to @xmath69 in @xmath14 .",
    "this is proved by using equation  .",
    "following @xcite we introduce complete orthoschemes .",
    "as is mentioned in the introduction , an ( ordinary ) _ orthoscheme _ in the three - dimensional hyperbolic space is a tetrahedron with vertices @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 which satisfies that @xmath10 is perpendicular to @xmath11 and that @xmath12 is orthogonal to @xmath13 .",
    "the vertices @xmath0 and @xmath3 are called _",
    "principal vertices_.    _ complete orthoschemes _ are a generalization of ordinary orthoschemes by allowing one or both principal vertices to be ideal or ultraideal .",
    "take @xmath14 as our favorite model of the hyperbolic space in what follows . as a set ,",
    "any orthoscheme in the ordinary sense are given as a euclidean tetrahedron in @xmath14 .",
    "when one or both principal vertices are ideal , the tetrahedron as a set in the hyperbolic space is no more bounded , but still has finite volume .",
    "we allow to call such tetrahedra ordinary orthoschemes",
    ".    further generalization of orthoschemes is explained via _",
    "truncation _ of ultraideal vertices .",
    "suppose a vertex @xmath70 of a tetrahedron @xmath4 is ultraideal .",
    "let @xmath71 be the half - space bounded by the polar plane of @xmath70 with @xmath72 .",
    "_ truncation _ of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath70 is defined as an operation to obtain a polyhedron @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath70 is close enough to @xmath17 , then @xmath73 is non - empty .",
    "truncation is also explained by using the hyperboloid model .",
    "the inverse image of @xmath70 for @xmath55 on @xmath31 consists of two points .",
    "each of them gives a half - space in @xmath22 , and one of them corresponds to the inverse image of @xmath71 . in this sense",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between half - spaces in @xmath14 and points in @xmath31 .",
    "the point in @xmath31 corresponding to @xmath70 with respect to @xmath71 in the sense above is called the _ proper _ inverse image of @xmath70 for truncation of @xmath4 .",
    "this correspondence will be used to calculate hyperbolic lengths of edges and hyperbolic dihedral angles between faces of complete orthoschemes .",
    "when one of the principal vertices , say @xmath3 , is ultraideal and @xmath0 is not ( i.e , ordinal or ideal ) , we have a polyhedron with finite volume by truncation with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "such a polyhedron is called a _ simple frustum _ with ultraideal vertex @xmath3 .",
    "we remark that the vertices @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are simultaneously deleted by truncation when @xmath3 is far away from @xmath14 , since both the polar geodesic plane of @xmath3 and the triangle @xmath12 are orthogonal to @xmath13 in @xmath14 .",
    "suppose both @xmath0 and @xmath3 are ultraideal .",
    "there are three possibilities : the polar planes of @xmath0 and @xmath3 intersect in @xmath14 , they are parallel , or they are ultraparallel . in the first case ,",
    "the polyhedron we obtain by truncation is well known as a _",
    "lambert cube_. see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  2 ) for example .",
    "the edge @xmath74 is deleted by truncation . in the third case ,",
    "on the other hand , the polyhedron obtained by truncation still has the edge induced from @xmath74 .",
    "we call this polyhedron a _ double frustum_. the second case is the limiting situation of both the first and the third cases .",
    "we call polyhedra obtained in the second case _ double frustum with an ideal vertex_.    as a summary , combinatorial types of complete orthoschemes are either    * ordinary orthoschemes , whose principal vertices are either ordinarily points or ideal points , * simple frustums , * double frustums possibly with an ideal vertex , or * lambert cubes .",
    "kellerhals obtained formulae to calculate volumes of complete orthoschemes in @xcite ; the formula for lambert cubes is given in theorem  iii , and the formula for other kinds of complete orthoschemes is given in theorem  ii . in both formulae",
    ", they are parametrized by the three non - right hyperbolic dihedral angles . under the same setting used in section  [ sec : orthoschemes ] , we denote by @xmath75 the hyperbolic dihedral angle between faces opposite to @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ". when a complete orthoscheme is a lambert cube , the geodesic planes containing faces opposite to @xmath1 and @xmath2 are ultraparallel . in this case",
    "@xmath76 is defined to be the hyperbolic dihedral angle between the polar geodesic planes of the vertex @xmath0 and @xmath3 . in this sense",
    "the formulae are parametrized by @xmath77 , @xmath76 and @xmath78 .",
    "kellerhals used the _ schlfli differential formula _ to obtain these volume formulae .",
    "the volume formulae are not used directly in our arguments ; what we will use is the fact that the formulae are parametrized by the three non - right hyperbolic dihedral angles . on the other hand ,",
    "the schlfli differential formula itself plays an important role in our arguments .",
    "the schlfli differential formula gives an expression of the differential form of the volume function with respect to the hyperbolic lengths of edges and hyperbolic dihedral angles between faces .",
    "as is given in theorem  i in @xcite , the differential form @xmath79 of the volume function @xmath80 of any complete orthoschemes is expressed as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the hyperbolic length of the edge @xmath5 if both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are points in @xmath14 , @xmath82 is the hyperbolic distance between @xmath6 and the polar geodesic plane of @xmath7 if @xmath6 is a point in @xmath14 and @xmath7 lies in the exterior of @xmath14 , and @xmath82 is the hyperbolic distance between the polar geodesic planes of @xmath6 and @xmath7 if both @xmath6 and @xmath7 lie in the exterior of @xmath14 .",
    "if a complete orthoscheme is a lambert cube , then @xmath83 is taken as the hyperbolic length of the edge obtained as the intersection of the polar geodesic planes of @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "if one of @xmath0 and @xmath3 is ideal , then the edges with the ideal vertex as an endpoint have infinite hyperbolic lengths . in this case",
    "we take any horosphere centered at the ideal vertex , and each infinite length is replaced by the signed hyperbolic distance between the other endpoint and the horosphere .",
    "as is mentioned in the concluding remarks in @xcite , the schlfli differential formula is still valid by this treatment .    as a result , the schlfli differential formula is applicable to any kind of complete orthoschemes .",
    "we use the formula as the equation @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "this equation plays a key role in the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "suppose @xmath14 lies in the @xmath86-coordinate space of @xmath15 . by the action of an isometry , any ordinary orthoscheme can be put as the vertex @xmath0 is in the positive quadrant of the @xmath87-plane , the vertex @xmath1 is on the positive part of the @xmath88-axis , the vertex @xmath2 is the origin , and the vertex @xmath3 is on the positive part of the @xmath89-axis .",
    "such orthoschemes are parametrized by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the @xmath89-coordinate of @xmath3 , i.e. , the euclidean distance between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath92 is the euclidean distance between @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and @xmath51 is the euclidean angle between edges @xmath93 and @xmath18 .",
    "when we regard such an orthoscheme as a tetrahedron with base @xmath12 , the @xmath89-coordinate @xmath91 of @xmath3 is the  height \" of the tetrahedron .",

    "the function @xmath100 is continuous on @xmath101 and piecewise differentiable on the intervals each of which corresponds to a combinatorial type of complete orthoschemes given at the end of section  [ sec : orthoschemes ] .",
