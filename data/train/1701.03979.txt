    "<S> it is shown that the single - particle spin - orbit coupling terms , which  in the cold atom context  are associated with synthetic gauge fields , can significantly and non - trivially modify the phase accumulation at small interparticle distances even if the length scale @xmath0 associated with the spin - orbit coupling term is significantly larger than the van der waals length @xmath1 that characterizes the two - body interaction potential . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical framework , which utilizes a generalized local frame transformation and accounts for the phase accumulation analytically , is developed . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with numerical coupled - channels calculations demonstrates that the phase accumulation can , to a very good approximation , be described over a wide range of energies by the free - space scattering phase shifts  evaluated at a scattering energy that depends on @xmath2and the spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the tunability of low - energy scattering parameters such as the @xmath3-wave scattering length @xmath4 and @xmath5-wave scattering volume @xmath6 by means of application of an external magnetic field in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance  @xcite has transformed the field of ultracold atom physics , providing experimentalists with a knob to `` dial in '' the desired hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this tunability has afforded the investigation of a host of new phenomena including the bec - bcs crossover  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most theoretical treatments of these phenomena are formulated in terms of a few scattering quantities such as @xmath4 and @xmath6 , which properly describe the low - energy behavior of the two - body system .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent realization of spin - orbit coupled cold atom systems  @xcite is considered another milestone , opening the door for the observation of topological properties and providing a new platform with which to study scenarios typically encountered in condensed matter systems with unprecedented control  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an assumption that underlies most theoretical treatments of cold atom systems with synthetic gauge fields is that the spin - orbit coupling term , i.e. , the raman laser that couples the different internal states or the shaking of the lattice that couples different bands , leaves the atom - atom interactions `` untouched '' . more specifically , mean - field treatments `` simply '' add the single - particle spin - orbit coupling term to the mean - field hamiltonian and parameterize the atom - atom interactions via contact potentials with coupling strengths that are calculated for the two - body van der waals potential without the spin - orbit coupling terms  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> consistent with such mean - field approaches , most two - body scattering studies derive observables based on the assumption that the two - body bethe - peierls boundary condition , derived in the absence of single - particle spin - orbit coupling terms , remains unaffected by the spin - orbit coupling terms , provided an appropriate `` basis transformation '' is accounted for  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying premise of these two - body and mean - field treatments is rooted in scale separation , which suggests that the free - space scattering length @xmath4 and scattering volume @xmath6 remain good quantities provided @xmath0 is larger than the two - body van der waals length @xmath1 . indeed , model calculations for a square - well potential in the presence of three - dimensional isotropic spin - orbit coupling suggest that the above reasoning holds , provided @xmath7 and @xmath6 are small  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this work revisits the question of how to obtain and parameterize two - body scattering observables in the presence of three - dimensional isotropic spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to what has been reported in the literature , our calculations for lennard - jones and square - well potentials show that the three - dimensional isotropic spin - orbit coupling terms can impact the phase accumulation in the small interparticle distance region where the two - body interaction potential can not be neglected even if @xmath0 is notably larger than @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe non - perturbative changes of the scattering observables when @xmath2 changes by a small amount . an analytical treatment , which reproduces the full coupled - channels results such as the energy - dependent two - body cross sections for the finite - range potentials with high accuracy , </S>",
    "<S> is developed . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical treatment relies , as do previous treatments  @xcite , on separating the short- and large - distance regions . </S>",
    "<S> the short - distance hamiltonian is treated by applying a gauge transformation , followed by a rotation , that `` replaces '' the @xmath8-dependent spin - orbit coupling term by an @xmath9- and @xmath8-independent diagonal matrix ( @xmath9 and @xmath8 denote the relative position and momentum vectors , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonal terms , which can be interpreted as shifting the scattering energy in each channel , can introduce non - perturbative changes in the scattering observables for small changes in @xmath2 , especially when @xmath6 is large . </S>",
    "<S> we note that our derivation of the short - distance hamiltonian , although similar in spirit , differs in subtle but important ways from what is presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our analytical framework also paves the way for designing energy - dependent zero - range or @xmath10-shell pseudo - potentials applicable to systems with spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> while energy - dependent pseudo - potentials have proven useful in describing systems without spin - orbit coupling  @xcite , generalizations to systems with spin - orbit coupling are non - trivial due to the more intricate nature of the dispersion curves . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest a paradigm shift in thinking about spin - orbit coupled systems with non - vanishing two - body interactions . while the usual approach is to assume that the short - distance behavior or the effective coupling strengths are not impacted by the spin - orbit coupling terms </S>",
    "<S> , our results suggest that they can be for specific parameter combinations . </S>",
    "<S> even though our analysis is carried out for the case of three - dimensional isotropic spin - orbit coupling , our results point toward a more general conclusion , namely that spin - orbit coupling terms may , in general , notably modify the phase accumulation in the short - distance region .    </S>",
