    "one of the most promising outcomes of the study of gravitational lensing is the potential to determine the hubble constant , h@xmath1 , independent of the standard distance ladder ( refsdal 1964 ) .",
    "the light travel times for the lensed images are not equal due to the geometrical path length difference caused by the gravitational potential of the lens .",
    "this results in a time delay between the lensed images that can be measured by monitoring the images over a period of time .",
    "thus , given a measurement of time delay and a knowledge of the gravitational potential of the lens , one can estimate h@xmath1 . at present , the accuracy of h@xmath1 values determined by this method is limited mainly by our knowledge of the mass distribution in the distant lensing galaxy .",
    "so far , time - delay measurements are available for seven lensed systems . for the twin quasar 0957 + 561 the measured values at both radio and optical wavelengths are in agreement and",
    "have been confirmed by observing variability in the image b after it was recorded in the image a ( schild & thomson 1997 , kundi et al .",
    "1997b , haarsma et al .",
    "1999 ) . while for this system",
    "a reliable measurement of the time delay has been achieved , translation into an estimate of the hubble constant turns out to be not straightforward ( narasimha , 1999 ) .",
    "for the systems pg  1115 + 080 ( schechter et al .",
    "1997 ) , b1608 + 656 ( fassnacht et al .",
    "1999 ) , pks  1830 - 211 ( lovell et al . 1998 ) , b1600 + 434 ( koopmans et al .",
    "2000 ) the measured delays are less accurate , mainly because it is not easy to extract the intrinsic variability and determine its phase lag between the images .",
    "the system b0218 + 357 has good time delay measurements ( biggs et al .",
    "1999 ) and the redshift combination of the lens and source are favourable for a possible determination of h@xmath1 , but the lens models continue to be ill - constrained .",
    "however , these systems together cover various combinations of the distance to the source and lens as well as the distance from the lens to the source ; hence an estimate of the distance scale from time - delays in all these systems together would be an important step to determine the hubble constant and the large scale geometry of the universe .",
    "the lens system b1422 + 231 is particularly interesting in this respect , as the redshift of the source , z@xmath2 , ( patnaik et al . 1992 ) is very large compared to the redshift of the lens , z@xmath3 , ( kundi et al . 1997a , tonry 1998 ) and consequently , the time - delay is a more direct measure of the distance to the lens .",
    "b1422 + 231 is a quadruple system which has been observed at various wavebands ( patnaik et al . 1992 ; lawrence et al . 1992 ; remy et al . 1993 ; yee & ellingson 1994 ; bechtold & yee 1995 ; akujor et al . 1996 ; yee & bechtold 1996 ; impey et al . 1996 ) .",
    "several models have been presented to explain the lens system ( hogg & blandford 1994 , narasimha & patnaik , 1994 , kormann , schneider & bartlemann 1994 , mao & schneider 1998 ) .",
    "detailed radio maps at sub - milliarcsecond resolution are available for the images ( patnaik et al .",
    "1999 ) and the mapping of the resolved structures of the images can be used for construction of the lens models .",
    "optical spectra of the images have been taken with high sensitivity ( impey et al . 1996 ) and the emission line profiles of strong lines like ly@xmath4 have been used by narasimha & srianand ( 1999 ) to constrain the lens models .",
    "thus , it is clear that a measurement of the time - delay for this system will be useful for the calibration of the cosmic distance scale , even though the source is not highly variable .",
    "the vla monitoring campaign of the gravitational lens b1422 + 231 was carried out at two frequencies , 8.4 and 15  ghz between 1994 march 03 to september 16 .",
    "we used two 50  mhz - wide if bands at each frequency .",
    "we used 3c286 ( j1331 + 3030 ) to calibrate the flux density scale , oq208 ( j1407 + 2827 ) as the phase calibrator , and 3c287 ( j1330 + 2509 ) as a control source since it is not expected to be a variable source .",
    "the other reason for selecting this source is that it is close to the declination of our target source to ensure proper calibration of gain as a function of elevation .",
    "the observations were carried out for about 30  min on each day , the integration time for the target source was 5  min at each frequency and the rest of the time was used for observing the calibration and control sources .",
    "accurate calibration is of vital importance in this kind of monitoring observations .",
    "the observations of the two calibrators ensure that any variations in them must be due to calibration errors and hence these variations can , at least partially , be removed from the light curve of the lensed images .",
    "we chose two different frequencies in order to have confidence in the measurements of time delay as it is independent of frequency , though the variability of quasars does depend on the frequency in the sense that they tend to be more variable at higher frequencies . in the present case , we chose 8.4 and 15  ghz for the following reasons .",
    "in the a configuration of the vla the resolutions are about 0.2 and 0.13  arcsec at 8.4 and 15  ghz respectively , which allows clean separation of the images . in the b configuration , however , the two brighter images , a and b , are blended together at 8.4  ghz since the resolution is three times poorer , while there is no such difficulty at 15  ghz .",
    "we can sample the light curve over the periods of a and b configurations of the vla at 15  ghz but only during the a configuration at 8.4  ghz .",
    "the data were calibrated and imaged using the aips software package of national radio astronomy observatory . assumed flux densities of 3c286 were 5.145  jy and 5.124  jy at the centre frequencies of the two if bands which are 8.4149  ghz and 8.4649  ghz respectively , and 3.449  jy and 3.457  jy at 14.9649  ghz and 14.9149  ghz respectively . since 3c286 is partially resolved at these frequencies , we followed the standard procedure in using the shortest baselines to set the scale of flux density .",
    "we assumed that both oq208 and 3c287 are unresolved sources and used them to determine the gain solutions .",
    "we then used the aips program getjy to determine the flux densities of these two sources which are bootstrapped from 3c286 .",
    "the source 3c287 is , in fact , partially resolved in the a - array ( its flux density changes from 1.4  jy at short spacings to 0.9  jy at the longest spacing at 15ghz ) .",
    "we could have mapped the source to determine its flux density . however , the assumption that it is a point source affects its flux density measurement by only 0.5% ( our method gets less flux density ) .",
    "thus the assumption that 3c287 behaves as a point source is justified .",
    "moreover , we avoid introducing errors as a result of the mapping process .",
    "the vla configuration was changed from a to b during our monitoring campaign .",
    "in fact , the data presented for 8.4  ghz was only for the duration of the a - array .",
    "we do not see any effects of the change of the array configuration in the light curves of the calibrators at 15ghz , giving confidence in the calibration method followed .",
    "we used the gain solutions for the phase calibrator , oq208 , to interpolate the amplitude and phase corrections for the target source .",
    "the observations were scheduled in intervals of between 2 and 11 days .",
    "the measured flux densities are presented in tables 1 and 2 for 8.4 and 15  ghz respectively . at 15  ghz we had 51 epochs covering both a and b configurations of the vla . at 8.4  ghz",
    "we had only 18 epochs since its span was limited to the a configuration .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     @xmath5  after eliminating two days when the reference star exhibited considerable fluctuation .",
    "+ @xmath6  the smoothed cubic spline did not converge and hence we can not get a time ",
    "delay for the total flux .",
    "+    for the system pg1115 + 080 , again , our results are broadly in agreement with schechter et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) . however , a few comments are worth mentioning . first , the time delay between images b and c are generally stable against analysis technique or some amount of noise in the data . but the time ",
    "delay between the merging image a and the other two are sensitive to the method adopted as well as the noise in the reference star .",
    "second , for the whole data , our time ",
    "delay between images b and c is slightly smaller than the value given by schechter et al .",
    "but if we drop two days on which the fluctuation in the magnitude of the reference star was comparable to the amplitude of variability of the quasar , the time ",
    "delay becomes 24.4 days , which is exactly in between the values derived by schechter et  al . and",
    "barkana ( 1997 ) .",
    "third , our value for the time delay between images a and b range from 6 to 11 days , depending on using or dropping the data for the two days . the corresponding value for the time  delay between images c and a vary between 14 and 13 days .",
    "consequently , our time ",
    "delay ratio between ca and ab are always consistent with the lens models ; the small ratio supports a compact lens and higher value for the hubble constant while the larger ratio favours an extended lens and smaller hubble constant .",
    "we have monitored b1422 + 231 with the vla at two different frequencies .",
    "the light curves were sampled at intervals of 2 to 10 days only because we did not have a good idea of the amplitude of intrinsic variability and were interested in the image d in view of its importance for cosmological distance calibration .",
    "consequently , we are unable to get very accurate value for the time delay between images .",
    "but we are able to determine the time delay between the bright images using the 15  ghz observations , obtaining 1.5 , 7.6 and 8.2 days for ab , ca and cb time delays respectively .",
    "more extensive monitoring at significantly higher signal to noise ratio is necessary to determine the time delay between the weak image d and the other images .",
