    "herbig - haro ( hh ) objects are the optical manifestations of outflows from young stellar objects ( ysos ) . following the discovery of jet - like structures in hh objects ( dopita et al . 1982 ; mundt & fried 1983 ) , many of these hh jets were observed in the orion ( reipurth et al .",
    "1986 ; mundt et al . 1987 ; reipurth 1989a , reipurth 1989b ) and taurus ( mundt et al 1988 ) star formation regions .",
    "these objects present a characteristic morphology of aligned knots extending over @xmath5  pc .",
    "it appears that the kinematics and morphologies of these jets depend simultaneously on the time - dependent nature of the outflow activity and on the interaction of the hypersonic flows with the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "it has recently been discovered ( bally & devine 1994 ; reipurth et al .",
    "1997 ; devine et al . 1997 ) that a few hh jets extend over distances of a few parsecs .",
    "for example , hh  111 shows a total extent of @xmath6  pc , hh  34 of @xmath7  pc and hh  355 a total extent of @xmath8  pc .",
    "apart from their alignments , the main evidence that the knots belong to the same jet ( and not to other , smaller outflows ) is their kinematic association with red- and blue - shifted bipolar lobes . from the radial velocity , the proper motions and the distance of the knots from the source it has been possible to estimate a typical dynamical age of @xmath9  yr for these `` giant jets '' .",
    "an important characteristic of the giant jets is that they appear to slow down for increasing distances from the outflow source .",
    "this effect is seen in the hh  34 ( devine et al .",
    "1997 ) and in the hh  111 giant jets ( reipurth et al . 1997 ; rosado et al .",
    "the present paper is concerned with the possible theoretical interpretations of the deceleration effect .",
    "this is a critical point in the determination of the jet s age and also in the identification of the physical properties of the central engine that feeds the outflows .",
    "the potential causes that might produce such a deceleration can be divided into two categories  :    * internal causes , i.e. that the mechanism is intrinsically related to the properties of the outflow , for example to a temporal variability of the ejection velocity , * external causes , i.e. that the deceleration is due to the drag effect resulting from the interaction of the hypersonic flow with the interstellar medium .",
    "previous studies have considered both of these possibilities .",
    "cabrit & raga ( 2000 ) considered the case of an ejection velocity which monotonically grows as a function of time , and tried to fit the observed , position - dependent jet velocity with different , parameterized forms of the ejection velocity time - dependence .",
    "these authors concluded that the only way to fit the observed kinematics of the hh  34 giant jet is with an ejection velocity that slowly increases over @xmath10  yr , followed by a very strongly increasing ejection velocity over the last @xmath9  yr .",
    "cabrit & raga ( 2000 ) argued that this very dramatic increase in the ejection velocity at recent times appeared to be unlikely , and then studied an alternative scenario .",
    "following the idea proposed by devine et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , they considered the knots along the hh  34 giant jet as scattered `` bullets '' resulting from the combination of an ejection velocity variability and a precession of the jet axis .",
    "raga & biro ( 1993 ) have carried out a theoretical study of this kind of flow , obtaining an analytic description of this `` machine gun jet '' flow and comparing this model with a numerical simulation of a radiative , 2d `` slab '' jet with a time - dependent ejection velocity and direction .",
    "one could argue that the jet / counterjet symmetry observed in the hh  34 giant jet ( see devine et al .",
    "1997 ) goes against the `` environmental drag '' scenario for the deceleration of this object . as there is no reason to suppose that the environments within which the jet and the counterjet are traveling have identical densities",
    ", one would think that the drag would introduce asymmetries between the two outflow lobes . however , the deceleration induced by the environmental drag is proportional to @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the environmental density , see cabrit & raga 2000 ) , so that these asymmetries might not be so important .    also , de gouveia dal pino ( 2001 ) presented 3d simulations ( done with the lagrangian sph method ) of hh  34 assuming a sinusoidal ejection velocity variability of the kind used by raga & noriega - crespo ( 1998 ) and studying the two cases of a pressured and overpressured jet without considering the precession contribution . to reproduce the large spatial working surface structures the author used a half - amplitude of the velocity modulation of @xmath13  km  s@xmath14 and a period of @xmath15 yr .",
    "the author obtained encouraging results showing that a deceleration of the jet velocity was obtained from the model ( lower decelerations being produced for initially overpressured jets than for pressure matched jets ) .",
    "she concluded from the simulations that the deceleration was related to the temporal velocity variability of the jet at injection and was mainly caused by progressive momentum transfer sideways into the surrounding medium by the expelled gas from the travelling working surfaces .",
    "she also found that a steady state jet , with similar initial conditions to those of the pulsed jet , experienced , on the contrary , an initial acceleration followed by a constant velocity propagation regime , which was an additional indication that the primary source of deceleration in giant flows could not be attributed to simple breaking of the jet head against the external medium .",
    "these models were run over a distance of only @xmath16 pc , well below the size of the giant hh  34 jet ( see devine et al . 1997 ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we carry out a numerical study of the effect of a precession of the outflow axis on the deceleration of a giant jet .",
    "the existence of such a phenomenon is suggested by the observed morphology of the flow , which shows evidence of long period ( of the order of @xmath17 yr ) precession ( devine et al .",
    "the precession is generally ascribed to tidal forces produced by a companion in a binary or multiple system .",
    "even though in the case of hh  34 the binary source has noy yet resolved , there are elements that indicate that this source could be a binary such as the discovery of a second outflow ( hh  534 ) emanating from the source as well as the abrupt change of direction of the jet axis near the knots b ( reipurth et al . 2002 ) .",
    "less evident is the explanation of the existence of a precession period of the order of @xmath18 yr .",
    "as reported in terquem et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the precession period ( @xmath19 ) depends on the orbital parameters and the spatial extent of the accretion disk .",
    "the precession period is generally at least one order of magnitude larger than the orbital period .",
    "therefore , to justify such a large @xmath19 we need a value of the ratio between the accretion radius disk @xmath20 and the orbital radius @xmath21 ( @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath20/@xmath21 ) of the order of @xmath24 ( see masciadri & raga , 2002 ) .",
    "reipurth ( 2000 ) has also proposed that perturbations on an accretion disk due to close passages ( i.  e. , at perihelion ) of a binary companion in an elliptical orbit could be responsible for producing a time - variability in the ejection of the outflow .",
    "it is of course unclear whether or not such a mechanism could produce a variability in the ejection velocity such as the one included in our jet models .",
    "we carry out the simulations of only one of the two lobes of hh  34 ( with and without precession ) conserving the same geometrical and physical parameters .",
    "however , our numerical simulations could correspond to any of the two lobes of the hh  34 giant jet .",
    "actually , our simulations are made to reproduce the morphology of the northern lobe of the hh  34 outflow , and in order to compare the predicted maps with the southern lobe it is necessary to carry out a point reflection of the predicted maps with respect to the position of the outflow source .",
    "this point symmetry of a precessing jet / counterjet system is clearly seen in the observations of the hh  34 giant outflow ( devine et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we underline that this study can not be applied in a simple way to other giant jets .",
    "the two lobes of hh  111 , for example , show quite straight paths .",
    "hh  355 , on the contrary , seems to precess with a half - opening angle of @xmath25 and a period of @xmath26-@xmath27 yr ( reipurth et al .",
    "further work should be carried out to study the properties of these other giant flows .",
    "we find that the impact of the precession on the deceleration mechanism is quite considerable , and that the dynamical age of the jet grows by @xmath28  yr when including a precession .",
    "we also find that h@xmath2 intensity maps and position - velocity diagrams obtained from models with precession reproduce the observations of the hh  34 giant jet in a qualitatively successful way ( an agreement which is not found for models without precession ) .",
    "we add that , from a numerical point of view it is not a simple exercise to reproduce the evolution of outflows over such a large spatial and temporal extent particularly given the small initial radius of the beam . indeed , in order to cover the whole domain of @xmath29 pc , previously published simulations used @xmath30 @xmath23 @xmath31 cm ( de gouveia dal pino 2001 ) and @xmath30 @xmath23 @xmath32 cm jet radii ( cabrit & raga 2000 ) , which are @xmath33-@xmath34 order of magnitude greater than the width of the jet as observed in hst images ( reipurth & raga 1999 ) .",
    "one of the goals of our study is to simulate the hh  34 giant jet over its full extent ( @xmath35 @xmath29 pc ) using the correct @xmath30 @xmath23 @xmath36 cm initial jet radius corresponding to @xmath37 at @xmath38 pc .",
    "we underline that the radius is measured at @xmath39 distance away from the hh  34 source .    in section [ param ] ,",
    "we describe the parameters and the ejection velocity time - variability used in our models of the hh  34 jet . in section [ numer ] the numerical simulations",
    "are discussed , and h@xmath2 maps and position - velocity diagrams predicted from models with and without precession are presented and compared with the corresponding observations of the hh  34 giant jet . in section [ conc ] we summarize the conclusions of this study .",
    "following the study of hh  34 of raga & noriega - crespo ( 1998 ) , we attempt to reproduce the structure of this jet by assuming the existence of a sinusoidal ejection velocity time - variability . as our work",
    "is focussed on trying to reproduce the large scale structure of this outflow , a single mode time - variability is appropriate , as opposed to the three - mode variability used by raga & noriega - crespo ( 1998 ) to model the structures close to the source along the southern lobe .",
    "we therefore consider an ejection velocity of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the average jet velocity , @xmath42 is the frequency ( @xmath43 is the period ) and @xmath44 is the half - amplitude of the variability law .",
    "we adopt the following values  : @xmath45  km  s@xmath14 , @xmath46  km  s@xmath14 and @xmath47  yr .",
    "these values are consistent with the long period mode deduced from the kinematics of the southern lobe of hh  34 by raga & noriega - crespo ( 1998 ) .",
    "also , these parameters give a spatial separation @xmath48 which corresponds to a separation of @xmath49 on the plane of the sky ( considering a distance of 460  pc to hh  34 and a @xmath50 angle between the outflow axis and the plane of the sky ) .",
    "this separation is consistent with the separations between successive knots along the hh  34 giant jet ( see devine et al .",
    "1997 ) . also , the images of the hh  34 giant jet show evidence of a long period precession . from the images of bally & devine ( 1994 ) and devine et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we find that both the jet and the counterjet appear to lie within a cone of half - opening angle @xmath51 , and that the locus of the jet appears to imply a @xmath52  yr precession period .",
    "we take these values as estimates of a possible precession of the hh  34 outflow .    for our numerical simulations , we consider that the jet has a top - hat initial cross section , of radius @xmath53  cm , corresponding to @xmath54 at the distance of hh  34 , which is consistent with the recent results obtained from hst images of this object ( reipurth et al .",
    "moreover , we choose two initial jet number densities , @xmath55 and @xmath56  @xmath57 .",
    "we have assumed that the surrounding environment is homogeneous , with a @xmath58  @xmath57 number density .",
    "we have set the initial temperature of both the jet and the environment to 1000  k , and assumed that the gas is neutral , with the exception of carbon , which is singly ionized .",
    "the simulations were carried out using 3d gasdynamic adaptive grid yguazu -  code .",
    "this code integrates the 3d gasdynamic equations and a set of atomic / ionic reaction equations for the species hi , hii , oi , oii , oiii , cii , ciii and civ .",
    "they are the main contributors to the cooling function .",
    "the yguazu -  code employs the _ flux - vector splitting _",
    "algorithm of van leer ( 1982 ) and it was described in detail by raga et al .",
    "the reaction rates and the non - equilibrium cooling function that we have used are given by raga et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "the computations were carried out on a 7-level , binary adaptive grid with a maximum resolution along the three axes of @xmath59  cm .",
    "the computational domain extends over @xmath60x@xmath61  cm , corresponding to @xmath62 grid points at the highest resolution grid level .",
    "the jet is injected at the origin in the centre of the @xmath63-plane and the outflow axis precesses around the @xmath64-axis .",
    "the maximum resolution ( level @xmath65 ) is allowed only within a region limited within a spherical surface of radius @xmath66  cm centred on the injection point .",
    "the next highest resolution ( level @xmath67 ) is allowed only in a region with an outer radius of @xmath68  cm .",
    "figure [ grid ] shows the adaptive grid configuration on the @xmath69-plane obtained from model b ( see below ) after a @xmath70  s time integration .",
    "this figure shows the grid in a domain of size ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 )  cm ( left frame ) , and two successive zooms ( centre and right ) showing the higher resolution grids .",
    "we computed three different models  :    * * model a - * a jet that precesses in a cone of half - angle @xmath73 with a period @xmath74  yr .",
    "the initial jet density has a @xmath75  @xmath57 value , resulting in a @xmath76 jet to environment density ratio . * * model b - * the same precession as model a , but a jet with @xmath77  @xmath57 ( @xmath4 @xmath23 @xmath78 ) , * * model c - * a jet with the same parameters as model a but without precession .",
    "the three models have the time - dependent ejection velocity given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and the jet and ambient medium parameters given at the end of  2 .    as an example of the flows that result from our simulations , in figure [ colden ]",
    "we show a time - sequence of the column density obtained for model b ( which , as we show below is the model that more closely resembles de hh  34 giant jet ) .",
    "the column density was obtained by integrating the density field along the @xmath79-axis .",
    "figure [ colden ] shows that many working surfaces are formed , and that they travel in different directions away from the source as more or less independent `` bullets '' .",
    "the qualitative features of this kind of flow were discussed by raga & biro ( 1993 ) .      all the three models ( a , b and c )",
    "were run over different time intervals such that the outflows have traveled a distance of @xmath80  cm , equivalent to @xmath81  pc .",
    "figures [ mapaha_evol_a ] , [ mapaha_evol_b ] and [ mapaha_evol_c ] show the temporal evolution of the h@xmath2 maps predicted from the three models .",
    "these maps were computed assuming an @xmath50 angle between the outflow axis and the plane of the sky .",
    "the h@xmath2 emission coefficient was calculated considering the contributions of the recombination cascade and of collisional excitations from the ground state .",
    "it is evident that the locci of the jets are quite different for models a , b and c. model a and b show a bending not present in model c. moreover the first two models have a larger concentration of knots than the model c. the non - precessing model c , of course , shows a structure of aligned knots that looks dramatically different from models a and b. also , the times @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( corresponding to models a , b and c , respectively ) at which the jet heads reach a distance of @xmath33  pc from the source are substantially different from each other .",
    "we obtain @xmath85  yr , @xmath86  yr and @xmath87  yr .",
    "we note that the maximum h@xmath2 map value is equal to @xmath88 erg @xmath89 s@xmath14 sr@xmath14 in model a , equal to @xmath90 erg @xmath89 s@xmath14 sr@xmath14 in model b and equal to @xmath91 erg @xmath89 s@xmath14 sr@xmath14 in model c. comparing the results of our simulations with the measured h@xmath2 emission ( reipurth et al .",
    "2002 , fig .",
    "4 ) we conclude that the model that better reproduces the observed h@xmath2 fluxes is model b. indeed , the highest h@xmath2 contour obtained displayed in the hst images of reipurth et al .",
    "( 2002 , fig .",
    "4 ) corresponds to @xmath92 [ @xmath93-@xmath94 @xmath95 erg @xmath89 s@xmath14 pixel@xmath14 , which is equivalent to [ @xmath96-@xmath97 @xmath98 erg @xmath89 s@xmath14 sr@xmath14 .",
    "we conclude that the model that better reproduces the observed h@xmath2 fluxes is model b.    however , we find that the model predicions give h@xmath2 maps that are in general one order of magnitude fainter than the the observed ones . in a previous study ,",
    "raga & noriega - crespo ( 1998 ) found that for an initial jet density of @xmath99 @xmath100 , the predicted flux is two orders of magnitude fainter than hh  34 .",
    "the fact that we obtain a one order of magnitude higher flux is consistent with the fact that in the present model we have considered a @xmath101 @xmath57 jet density ( in other words , the models follow the standard intensity @xmath102 pre - shock density scaling law ) .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a better agreement with the h@xmath2 fluxes of hh  34 , we would need a model in which both the jet and the environment are denser by a factor of @xmath103 .",
    "we have not computed denser models , because they have shorter cooling distances , which would not be resolved appropriately in our numerical simulations .    at the same time",
    ", the morphology of the knot distribution in model b better resembles the observed morphology of the hh  34 giant jet ( devine et al .",
    "1997 , fig .",
    "6 ) than do the knot structures predicted from models a and c. we note that model a ( with @xmath76 ) produces , at a time @xmath104  yr from the beginning of the simulation , an extended shock structure ( resulting from a piling up of several working surfaces ) at about @xmath105  cm .",
    "such piling ups of working surfaces do not occur in model b ( which has @xmath106 ) , resulting in quite dramatically different h@xmath2 maps being predicted from both models .",
    "we therefore conclude that the jet - to - environment density ratio @xmath4 is a critical parameter for jets from precessing sources , and has to be adjusted in order to be able to reproduce the observations of a given hh jet",
    ".    the calculation of the temporal evolution of the h@xmath2 maps permitted us to retrieve the proper motions of the knots dispersed along the jet path .",
    "figure [ mapaha_tot2 ] shows h@xmath2 maps obtained at two different times . from the positions of the knots in these two frames , we have computed proper motion vectors ( shown on the left plot ) .",
    "one can observe that the magnitude of the proper motion velocity slows down as a function of distance from the source .",
    "this result is qualitatively consistent with the proper motion measurements of devine et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which show tangential velocities which decrease from @xmath107 @xmath108 to @xmath109 @xmath108 as a function of distance from the source along the giant jet .",
    "we do not attempt to carry out a quantitative comparison of the predicted and observed proper motions , as the errors of the proper motions of the hh  34 giant jet are quite large .    in order to carry out a more quantitative comparison between the kinematics of hh  34 and our models ,",
    "it is better to compare the predicted and measured radial velocities .",
    "this kind of comparison between models and observations is described in the following section .",
    "one of the most reliable ways to validate the simulations is to compare the pv diagrams obtained from the three models with observations . indeed ,",
    "one of the most interesting results of devine et al .",
    "( 1997 , fig .",
    "7 ) are their quite accurate measurements of decreasing radial velocities as a function of distance from the source along the hh  34 giant jet .",
    "figure [ diag_pv ] shows the pv diagrams predicted obtained from models a , b and c. the black , thin line represents the maximum of the emission ( as determined from quadratic fits to the line peaks ) vs. distance from the source .",
    "the three pv diagrams are calculated at the times at which the head of the jet reaches @xmath72  cm ( these times are @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , see  [ alfa ] ) .",
    "the same @xmath50 angle between the outflow axis and the plane of the sky was considered .",
    "figure [ mapaha_tot1 ] shows the radial velocity vs. distance from the source measured by devine at al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the knots along both the north and south lobes of the hh  34 giant jet .",
    "we changed the sign of the velocities of the knots in the south lobe , so that all of the velocities are then positive .",
    "the bold points are the peak of the gaussian fit and the error bars represent the fwhm of the emission line .",
    "we omitted the point related to the hh  34  x knot because , as one can see in figure 7 of devine et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , it is quite distant from the trend defined by the velocities of all of the other knots in the outflow .",
    "the three continuous lines join the radial velocities of the working surfaces ( the sharp velocity jumps in fig .",
    "[ diag_pv ] ) obtained from model a ( dotted line ) , model b ( thin line ) and model c ( dot - dash - dot line ) . these radial velocities ( shown with stars in the pv diagrams of fig .",
    "[ diag_pv ] ) correspond to the successive knots which are seen in the predicted h@xmath2 maps .",
    "the positions of the stars correspond to the intensity maxima ( i.  e. , the knots ) in the corresponding h@xmath2 maps .",
    "both figures [ diag_pv ] and [ mapaha_tot1 ] show that model a produces too steep radial velocity vs. distance decrease , particularly beyond @xmath110  cm from the source .",
    "model c produces radial velocities which are too high over the whole path of the jet . on the other hand",
    ", model b produces radial velocities which agree quite well with the observed values .",
    "figure [ mapaha_tot1 ] ( right - hand side ) shows linear fits to the radial velocities as a function distance from the source obtained from the observations and from models a , b and c , in other words , the lines trace the decreasing rate of the radial velocity . in this graph , we again see that while model a produces a too sharp drop in radial velocities , and model c gives velocities which are too high , model b does produce a good agreement with the observations .",
    "what can we say about the impact of the precession and of the initial jet to environmental pressure ratio ?",
    "we define @xmath111 as the ratio between the initial jet and environmental density ( @xmath111 @xmath23 @xmath4 ) and we define @xmath112 as the corresponding pressure ratio ( @xmath112 @xmath23 @xmath113 ) . knowing the values of @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 we can calculate @xmath112 @xmath23 @xmath118 for the models a and c and @xmath112 @xmath23 @xmath78 for model b. all three models are therefore overpressured , model a and c have the same value of @xmath112 and model b is more highly overpressured .",
    "figure [ mapaha_tot1 ] shows that the deceleration rates of models a and c are very different in spite of the fact that the two models have identical @xmath112 . considering that in model a we have a precession that is absent in the model c we",
    "would then conclude that the difference in the deceleration is a direct result of the precession .",
    "de gouveia dal pino ( 2001 ) studied the effects of different @xmath112 values on a non - precessing jet and found that lower values of @xmath112 resulted in stronger decelerations for the working surfaces .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the different @xmath112 values are obtained by changing the environmental temperature @xmath116 , with higher values of @xmath116 resulting in a stronger coupling between the aligned working surfaces and the surrounding gas ( and therefore causing a stronger deceleration ) .",
    "this rather subtle effect is not likely to be important in the case of a precessing jet for which the scattered working surfaces ram directly into the undisturbed environment .",
    "for this case , the important parameter for determining the deceleration rate is the density ratio @xmath111 .",
    "it would be interesting to study in the future the effect on the deceleration mechanism of two other flow parameters : the angle and the period of the precession .",
    "however , an idea of the effects that would be introduced can be obtained from the analytic model of raga & biro ( 1993 ) .",
    "these authors showed that the distance ( measured along the precession axis ) at which the working surfaces become independent `` bullets '' interacting with the surrounding environment is @xmath119 , corresponding to @xmath120  cm for our model b. therefore , in our model , the @xmath121 region in which the working surfaces are sheltered from a direct interaction with the environment is small , so that they are subjected to the full environmental drag during most of their evolution .",
    "we would then expect that all models with @xmath2 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 such that @xmath124 is much smaller than the full length of the jet will have deceleration properties similar to our models , provided that the they have the same @xmath125 and jet - to - environment density ratios .",
    "in this paper , we explore the role of a precession of the outflow axis on the deceleration of giant hh jets .",
    "in particular , we try to simulate the hh  34 giant jet , and we compare the results of our numerical simulations with previously published observations of this object .",
    "our simulations represent a step forward from previous numerical studies of hh objects , in that the use of a 7-level , binary adaptive grid has allowed us to compute models which appropriately cover all of the relevant scales of a giant jet , from the @xmath1  au jet radius close to the source to the @xmath3  pc length of the outflow .",
    "previous simulations of giant jets either did not cover the length of a real flow ( de gouveia dal pino 2001 ) , or else had a very large jet radius ( cabrit & raga 2000 and de gouveia dal pino 2001 ) .    a set of simulations done with and without precession of the outflow axis are presented , and predictions of h@xmath2 maps , proper motions and radial velocities are compared with the observations of devine et al .",
    "the principal conclusions of our study are the following  :    * we see that the morphology and kinematics of the hh  34 giant jet can be reproduced with a model of a jet with a sinusoidal ejection velocity variability ( with a mean velocity of 300  km  s@xmath14 , a half - amplitude of 100  km  s@xmath14 and a period of 1010  yr ) and a precession of the outflow axis ( with a half - angle of 6@xmath126 and a 12000  yr period ) .",
    "the simulated and measured h@xmath2 maps and radial velocities show a good qualitative as well as quantitative agreement , * comparing simulations done with and without precession we showed that the simple precession can give differences in the jet age estimations of the order of about @xmath127 yr .",
    "this proves that the drag effect produced by the external medium on the working surfaces is not negligible with respect to the @xmath0 yr dynamical timescale of the outflow .",
    "* we proved that the @xmath4 ratio is a critical parameter in the determination of the deceleration rate of the jet , and that it has to be properly adjusted in order to be able to fit the observed properties of a giant hh flow .",
    "the results of our study do not exclude that , in other giant jets , a correct jet deceleration could be attained without the precession .",
    "more models should be tested with different @xmath4 ratios to obtain more definite conclusions .",
    "besides this , in the case of hh  34 , the results seem to indicate that the precession has a fundamental role in the deceleration mechanism .",
    "we underline that the non - precessing , velocity - variable jet of model c also decelerates , however it has radial velocities which are larger than the observed ones in hh34 ( devine et al .",
    "previous 3d modeling of time - variable , non - precessing giant outflows ( de gouveia dal pino 2001 ) had also detected jet deceleration that reproduced the observations only qualitatively .",
    "therefore , the results of the present work indicate that in the case of hh34 , it is the combined effect of both , the jet temporal velocity variability and the precession ( along with the appropriate choice of the ratio @xmath128 ) that reproduces the observed deceleration pattern in that source ( as in model b ) .",
    "one could argue that model c with different @xmath4 ratios or velocity variability law could reproduce the correct deceleration . on the other hand we observe that a change of the @xmath4 ratio seems to produce a modification in the deceleration rate ( fig .",
    "[ mapaha_tot1 ] right hand side ) .",
    "a different velocity variability would produce a different distribution of the working surfaces along the jet trajectory and an h@xmath129 map characterized by a different emission .",
    "we also recall that the emission of the h@xmath129 maps strongly depends on the @xmath4 ratio . a smaller @xmath4 ratio in model c would probably reproduce a h@xmath129 map characterized by an emission level which is too low ( see section [ alfa ] ) .",
    "it therefore appears that these high radial velocities are due neither to an incorrect @xmath4 ratio nor to a velocity variability law different from the one that we have considered .    in our simulations of the hh  34 giant jet ,",
    "all of the structure of the outflow is due to a velocity variability with a single , sinusoidal mode and a well ordered precession . in our model , both the velocity variability and the precession last for all of the life of the outflow .",
    "furthermore , the ejection velocity variability that we have used agrees with the one determined by raga & noriega - crespo ( 1998 ) for the region between the source and hh  34s , so that there is evidence that this variability is continuing to at least quite close to the present time .",
    "the existence of a precession is an indication that the source belongs to a binary or multiple system .",
    "this is in agreement with reipurth ( 2000 ) , who argued that the sources of giant hh jets are binary or multiple systems .",
    "however , our results seem to be less consistent with the thesis proposed by reipurth ( 2000 ) that giant jets are fossil records of the evolution of orbital motions in disintregating multiple systems . this process has three distinct phases  : ( 1 ) a non - hierarchical state ( called _ interplay _ ) in which the multiple system performs a random motion , ( 2 ) a close triple approach in which a close binary is formed and a low mass star or embryo moves over to a larger orbit and ( 3 ) an ejection phase in which the low mass embryo is ejected from the nucleus of the system .    in our models , the structure of the hh  34 giant jet",
    "is reproduced without the need of having different properties of the ejection at different times , reflecting qualitative changes in the outflow source resulting from the three phases of a disintegrating multiple system ( see above ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that if the hh  34 system does correspond to an outflow history with distinct phases , the evidence for this appears to have been lost in the complexities of the interaction between the jet and the surrounding environment .",

    "<S> the giant jets represent a fundamental trace of the historical evolution of the outflow activity over timescales of @xmath0 yr , i.e. a timescale comparable to the accretion time of the outflow sources in their main protostellar phase . the study of such huge jets provides the possibility of retrieving important elements related to the life of the outflow sources . in this paper , we study the role of precession ( combined with jet velocity - variability and the resulting enhanced interaction with the surrounding environment ) as a deceleration mechanism for giant jets using a numerical approach . </S>",

    "<S> ( 1997 ) but it could not be numerically explored until now because it is intrinsically difficult to reproduce , at the same time , the large range of scales from @xmath1  au up to a few parsecs . in the present paper , we obtain predictions of h@xmath2 intensity maps and position - velocity diagrams from 3d simulations of the giant hh  34 jet ( including an appropriate ejection velocity time - variability and a precession of the outflow axis ) , and we compare them with previously published observations of this object . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations represent a step forward from previous numerical studies of hh objects , in that the use of a 7-level , binary adaptive grid has allowed us to compute models which appropiately cover all relevant scales of a giant jet , from the @xmath1  au jet radius close to the source to the @xmath3  pc length of the outflow . </S>",
    "<S> a good qualitative and quantitative agreement is found between the model predictions and the observations , indicating that a precession of the jet axis can indeed be the probable cause of the deceleration of the giant jets . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that a critical parameter for obtaining a better or worse agreement with the observations is the ratio @xmath4 between the jet and the environmental densities </S>",
