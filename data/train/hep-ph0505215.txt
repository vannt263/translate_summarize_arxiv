    "their perturbative renormalizability was discussed in @xcite , finding the remarkable result that they are multiplicatively renormalizable , without mixing with other operators . soon afterwards",
    ", the perturbative evaluation of the polyakov loop was addressed by gava and jengo @xcite within dimensional regularization , to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) . after including finite temperature vacuum polarization effects through debye mass insertion ,",
    "the leading order term turns out to be @xmath2 instead of the naively expected @xmath3 .",
    "their result implies that at high enough temperatures the renormalized polyakov loop should approach unity from above , a consequence of the non trivial factor introduced by the renormalization .",
    "( the expectation value of the bare polyakov loop vanishes in the continuum limit in any phase . )",
    "not much progress has been achieved after this early result . at present",
    "there are no perturbative calculations of the expectation value of the polyakov loop beyond nlo .",
    "as noted in @xcite a direct calculation would have to confront the proliferation of feynman diagrams due to infrared divergences @xcite .",

    "we investigate the role of condensates on the expectation value of the polyakov loop .",
    "the polyakov loop is closely related to the thermal expectation value of @xmath14 ( the nlo perturbative result can be obtained in this way ) and so condensate contributions to this quantity would have immediate impact on the polyakov loop .",
    "our motivation is best exposed by drawing an analogy with the zero temperature quark - antiquark potential in quenched qcd .",
    "the potential is , of course , closely related to the correlation function of two thermal wilson lines .",
    "the perturbative regime of the potential @xmath15 corresponds to small separations , where the potential is approximately coulombian . at separations of",
    "the order of @xmath16 ( there is no other scale in gluodynamics ) a linearly confining term develops and starts becoming dominant .",
    "both pieces of the potential evolve under the renormalization group at a logarithmically slow rate .",
    "therefore , modulo radiative corrections , the dimensionless quantity @xmath17 is composed of a flat perturbative piece plus a power - like term of the type @xmath18 which is non perturbative . in analogy , at high temperatures , we can consider the behavior of the dimensionless quantity @xmath19 , also directly related to the correlation function of two thermal wilson lines .",
    "the analogous of the scale @xmath20 in the previous case is the scale @xmath21 here , and certainly for large @xmath7 the quantity @xmath22 is perturbative and flat modulo a logarithmic dependence . at lower temperatures we contemplate the possibility of non perturbative power - like terms of the type @xmath23 to develop . as we show in this work ,",
    "such term enters naturally through ope corrections to the gluon propagator driven by condensates .",

    "the vacuum energy density of this theory , @xmath89 , has been computed to four loops in @xcite , with @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 as independent parameters .",
    "this allows to compute @xmath13 and @xmath93 by taking derivatives of @xmath94 with respect to @xmath95 and @xmath92 respectively , to obtain a perturbative estimate of the polyakov loop .",
    "the general structure of the vacuum energy density is as follows @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 denotes the number of loops and the coefficients @xmath98 depend logarithmically on @xmath91 .",
    "consequently , for the quantities in the expansion of @xmath0 one finds @xmath99 as can be seen from these formulas , the first missing contribution to @xmath0 would be @xmath100 from @xmath101 in the @xmath68 term .",
    "the lowest contribution from @xmath102 at 5 loops is @xmath103 and that from @xmath104 , not available from the computation , would first start at @xmath103 at 3 loops .",
    "so in principle , one could extend the perturbative result for @xmath0 to @xmath105 .",
    "unfortunately , the matching relations which connect @xmath91 , @xmath90 and @xmath92 to the four dimensional qcd parameters are only available in covariant gauges for which the relation ( [ eq:10 ] ) does not apply .",
    "in particular , the ratio @xmath55 used above is gauge dependent at @xmath3 from two loop contributions , this would introduce a gauge dependence at @xmath106 in @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , the non renormalizable terms @xmath107 ought to be examined as well to determine to which perturbative order they start contributing to @xmath0 .",

    "the other terms are effectively of higher order .",
    "numerically the terms @xmath110 computed with the available matching relations do not make a substantial contribution as they are qualitatively and also quantitatively similar to those in @xcite . again",
    "the radiative nature of these perturbative terms produces a rather flat logarithmic dependence with the temperature in sharp contrast with the lattice data at not too high temperatures .",
    "this reinforces the need of non perturbative effects .",
    "it is noteworthy that the contribution from @xmath111 starts at @xmath105 , and so to @xmath106 @xmath28 obeys a gaussian distribution .",

    "the gaussian ansatz becomes correct @xmath106 at high enough temperature where the theory becomes weakly interacting due to asymptotic freedom .",
    "also , it becomes exact in the large @xmath37 limit as higher order connected expectation values are suppressed by powers of @xmath114 .",
    "note that @xmath115 scales as @xmath116 and so @xmath1 has a well defined limit with the standard prescription of keeping @xmath117 finite as @xmath118 .",
    "a gaussian distribution for the polyakov loop has been observed in lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "the gaussian ansatz is in fact equivalent to expanding the exponential , averaging over color degrees of freedom and finally invoking the vacuum saturation hypothesis ( @xmath119 ) routinely applied in qcd sum rules at zero temperature . in this line ,",
    "the wilson loop was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the standard dimension 4 gluon condensate yielding for small contours a term proportional to the area squared of the contour .",

    "this agrees with the observation in ref .",
    "@xcite that dimension 2 condensates , effectively would - be tachyonic gluon masses , provide the short range signature of long range confining forces .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] the perturbative contributions to the polyakov loop expectation value describe only the region of very high temperature .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of what happens for the heavy quark - antiquark potential in qcd at zero temperature , as a function of the quark - antiquark separation .",
    "there , perturbation theory describes well the short distance region , where the theory is weakly interacting and standard one - gluon exchange produces a coulomb - like potential . at larger distances confinement sets in and a linear potential must be added to account for the lattice data @xcite . as the potential has dimensions of mass , the coulomb piece does not need a dimensionful coefficient .",
    "this makes it allowable in perturbation theory , where @xmath120 can only appear through logarithmic radiative corrections , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the linear confining piece of the potential requires a dimension two coefficient , the string tension , which in pure gluodynamics should be @xmath121 times a numerical coefficient . at one loop",
    "this implies a dependence @xmath122 , the scale @xmath123 being related to the quark - antiquark separation @xmath20 .",
    "while such contributions are perfectly possible in qcd , they are clearly beyond any finite order in perturbative qcd and can only be attained through suitable resummations of the perturbative series ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the non perturbative dependence on @xmath39 is not completely arbitrary , namely , it is such that @xmath120 appears raised to positive integer powers .",
    "this finds a natural explanation from the ope approach , where the non perturbative contributions are driven by condensates of concrete local operators . by dimensional",
    "counting , the condensate contributions carry a corresponding negative power momentum dependence , so they are subdominant at high momentum as compared to the purely perturbative terms but become more important at lower momenta , the lower dimensional operators being the dominant ones . in this line the confining piece of the zero temperature heavy quark - antiquark potential has been addressed phenomenologically by considering the contribution to the gluon propagator of a dimension two condensate , namely , @xmath124 in the landau gauge @xcite . just by dimensional",
    "counting such term produces a linearly confining term in the potential @xcite .    in this work",
    "we want to investigate the effect of low dimensional condensates on the polyakov loop expectation value .",
    "the region of high temperatures is weakly interacting and so ideas inspired on the high momentum region of the zero temperature theory might be useful here . as shown above , at high temperatures , the polyakov loop is closely related to the expectation value of @xmath125 in a static gauge .",
    "perturbatively , such quantity necessarily scales as @xmath69 , but non perturbatively a further term proportional to @xmath121 is allowed . in order to account for non perturbative contributions coming from condensates , we will consider adding to the propagator new phenomenological pieces driven by positive mass dimension parameters . specifically , we consider @xmath126 with the non perturbative term @xmath127 such ansatz parallels those made at zero temperature in the presence of condensates @xcite .",
    "this new piece produces a non perturbative contribution to @xmath13 , namely , @xmath128 if we assume that @xmath129 is temperature independent up to radiative corrections , the condensate will also be temperature independent , modulo these corrections .",

    "a fit to the data above @xmath183 using @xmath184 yields @xmath185 with @xmath186 .",
    "we have used @xmath187 with @xmath188  @xcite and @xmath189  @xcite .",
    "the fit has been done with equal weight to all data points and the value of @xmath190 quoted corresponds to a representative error @xmath191 in @xmath192 , which similar to that for the quenched case .",
    "a fit with @xmath137 and @xmath138 as free parameters gives @xmath193 with @xmath194 .",
    "as in the quenched case , the value of @xmath137 is consistent with the perturbative value at high temperature @xmath195    the lattice data show a departure from the linear pattern for temperatures closer to the transition than @xmath183 .",
    "such departure is not well described by adding new condensates of higher dimension and we have been unable to extract a condensate of dimension 4 from the data .",
    "we quote here the result of appending a term @xmath162 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adjust_pert ] ) .",
    "the fit of the data above @xmath196 gives @xmath197 and @xmath198 with @xmath199 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath138 and @xmath168 are highly correlated .",
    "alternative lattice determinations of the renormalized polyakov loop in pure gluodynamics have been addressed more recently in @xcite .",
    "these authors follow a different approach as compared to that in @xcite .",
    "they use single polyakov loops which are multiplicatively renormalized by extraction of the quark selfenergy .",
    "the latter is determined by isolating the cutoff dependent pieces by comparison of different lattice sizes at the same temperature .",
    "unfortunately the results of both approaches differ qualitatively , specially for temperatures above @xmath5 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] where the two lattice data sets are compared .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy between the results obtained with the two approaches is presently not clear , although lattice artifacts , in particular finite lattice spacing effects , are not completely excluded in @xcite as a possible explanation .",
    "( of course , there is also the possibility that after closer scrutiny the two definitions used by the two groups correspond really to different renormalized operators . )    in our view the results in @xcite would be the more reliable ones because the method used is technically simpler and amenable to tests .",
    "indeed , the authors are able to verify that for small separations of the two polyakov loops the standard zero temperature potential is very accurately reproduced as a function of @xmath20 for all temperatures .",
    "this is achieved after a single ( temperature dependent ) global shift is made , to remove the quark selfenergies ; this is the quantity @xmath200 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:26 ] ) .",
    "the contact between the zero and finite temperature potentials is complete for all separations between zero and a @xmath7 dependent radius @xmath201 related to the debye mass , thereby allowing a quite precise determination of the counterterm @xmath200 for each temperature .",
    "in addition , as noted above , the calculations are carried out for two different lattice sizes , @xmath182 and @xmath163 ( and also @xmath202 in @xcite ) , and the results for the renormalized polyakov show very small cutoff dependence , implying that the continuum limit has been reached .",
    "the method in @xcite is technically more difficult to implement ( quoting the authors , `` in practice , our method is not quite so trivial '' ) since it requires comparing different lattice sizes at the same physical temperature .",
    "also the subtraction of counterterms is more involved , since , using perturbation theory as guidance , the analogous of @xmath200 is expressed as power series of @xmath7 with coefficients to be fitted to the bare polyakov loop data . on the other hand , from the point of view of the model proposed in the present work ,",
    "we expect non perturbative corrections to be negligible at the highest temperatures considered in the two lattice calculations and only the data in @xcite seem to be consistent with perturbation theory @xcite at those temperatures .",
    "the method in @xcite renormalizes the logarithm of the bare polyakov loop by using the scheme @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the lattice temporal size , and so @xmath205 , @xmath206 being the inverse lattice spacing , i.e. the lattice cutoff .",
    "as said , the data in @xcite deviate from those in @xcite , and in particular , do not follow the pattern ( [ eq : adjust ] ) for @xmath207 .",
    "let us make a speculation assuming that either the removal of the cutoff dependent pieces has not been complete or that after removal of the those pieces , finite renormalization terms of the same type as the subtracted ones remain in the renormalized data of @xcite .",
    "is not just the consequence of a huge cutoff effect of the type @xmath208 instead of @xmath23 as proposed in this work .",
    "this is unlikely , first because the values of the cutoff @xmath206 in @xcite are much larger than @xmath120 and second , because the renormalized results are consistent for different lattice sizes , @xmath182 and @xmath163 . ] specifically , let us assume that the data follow the pattern @xmath209 actually , we find that the data above @xmath5 can fairly well be accounted for by using this pattern .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .    remarkably , the central value of the slope @xmath138 turns out to be close to that found previously with the other set of data .",
    "however , the best fit has large error bars due to the abundance of parameters available .",
    "@xmath210 with @xmath211 .",
    "similar remarks apply to the fit @xmath212 although in this case @xmath137 and @xmath213 can not be determined independently .",
    "this gives @xmath214 with @xmath215 .",
    "we find encouraging that the value of the condensate approximately agrees using the two different lattice data sets .",
    "nevertheless , this speculation is not completely conclusive and an agreement between the results of both lattice groups would be needed before further consequences could be extracted .",
    "there are two main results of our study . first , when suitably analyzed , the lattice data of the renormalized polyakov loop above the deconfinement phase transition show unequivocally the existence of a non perturbative dimension 2 condensate .",
    "such contributions have not been considered before but they are in fact dominant and allow to describe the data in @xcite down to temperatures _ as close to the transition as _",
    "@xmath148 for pure gluodynamics and @xmath183 for two flavors .",
    "furthermore , the numerical value obtained from the polyakov loop is quite consistent with the value of @xmath216 extracted from the pressure in gluodynamics .",
    "we have suggested identifying this condensate with the brst invariant dimension 2 gluon condensate .",
    "our second finding is that , for pure gluodynamics , the numerical value of the condensate @xmath217 , defined in a static gauge and extracted from polyakov loop data above the deconfinement transition , is remarkably close to the naive estimate @xmath218 , measured at zero temperature and in the landau gauge .",
    "these results pose the theoretical challenge of establishing the connection outlined in this paper on a firmer ground . in this light",
    "the analogy between the zero temperature potential and the polyakov loop noted in the introduction has been pushed forward in @xcite by showing that the model in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.1 ] ) predicts a relation between the string tension and the slope of the polyakov loop that is empirically satisfied .    the simple shape @xmath219 yields @xmath220 as @xmath221 , but does not describe the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the closest analogy to such transition would be near the inflexion point of @xmath222 , which takes place at a temperature @xmath223 .",
    "this @xmath224 would agree with @xmath225 for a universal geometrical value @xmath226 , which not far from the values obtained in this work from quenched qcd lattice data .",
    "nevertheless , this approximate coincidence can only be taken as an estimate since the concrete value of the inflexion point depends on whether @xmath222 or @xmath0 is used , for instance .",
    "it is noteworthy that the same shape can also be obtained within the instanton approach at finite temperature along the lines of @xcite .",
    "the relation between instantons and dimension 2 gluon condensates at zero temperature was suggested in @xcite and fruitfully exploited in recent lattice simulations to extract , via cooling techniques , the infrared behavior of the running coupling constant @xcite . in this regard",
    ", it might be rather interesting to isolate the purely non perturbative instantonic contributions on the lattice and determine whether , after cooling , the shape @xmath227 extends also below the phase transition .",
