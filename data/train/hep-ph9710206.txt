    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) , is the approach through consistently coupled schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equations for quark propagators and bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equations for bound states of quarks . among various studies of this kind , those of jain and munczek @xcite are judged by many as  the most extensive and phenomenologically successful spectroscopic studies in the rainbow",
    " ladder approximation \" @xcite and therefore often chosen @xcite as a representative , paradigmatic example of such studies .",
    "the essence of such a treatment of @xmath9 bound states is the solving of the ladder schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation for the dressed quark propagator @xmath10 , and then solving in the consistent approximation , with this resulting dressed quark propagator and with the same interaction kernel , the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) relativistic bound - state equation for a @xmath9 meson .",
    "this procedure is crucial for obtaining the mesons from the light pseudoscalar octet as goldstone bosons when the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken . thanks to this , a coupled sd - bs approach ( notably , @xcite ) can reproduce the correct chiral limit behavior ( crucial in the light sector ) simultaneously with the realistic results for heavy mesons . in @xcite ,",
    "the interaction kernel is given by a modeled gluon propagator consisting of : _ a ) _ the well  known perturbative part , reproducing correctly the ultraviolet ( uv ) asymptotic behavior unambiguously required by qcd in its high  energy , perturbative regime , and _",
    "b ) _ the nonperturbative part , which should describe the infrared ( ir ) behavior . since the ir behavior of qcd is still more or less unknown , this latter , nonperturbative part of the gluon propagator is modeled . in @xcite , several forms for this ir ",
    "part have been used and their parameters varied , with the outcome that results are not very sensitive to such variations .",
    "jain and munczek @xcite have succeeded in reproducing the leptonic decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons , and , even more importantly , a very large part of the meson spectrum , except for such elusive cases as the @xmath2@xmath3 system .",
    "such an up till now successful and reputable referent model should be tested further by calculating other quantities ( _ e.g. _ , electromagnetic processes ) to see how well it will do .",
    "this was our motivation for calculating @xmath11 and @xmath12 in @xcite , and jain and munczek s model passed this test very well .",
    "other applications are also under investigation , and still many others are possible .",
    "however , for the full assessment of a model and for getting useful insights in how to improve it , it is also very interesting to see how it performs at the very edges of its applicability . although jain and munczek s model is cleverly constructed so that it works well for most pseudoscalar and vector mesons below , above , and even on the mass scale of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the limitations of the (  improved \" @xcite or  generalized \" @xcite ) ladder approximation employed by the model put the @xmath2@xmath3 system on such an  applicability edge \" of this model  although not beyond it , contrary to what a pessimist could have concluded .",
    "this will be clarified below , where we analyze the @xmath2@xmath3 system and its @xmath4 decays in jain and munczek s model @xcite , demonstrate the abilities and limitations of this model , and anticipate in which way it can be extended to improve further the description of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "doing this on the fundamental level represents a formidable task in any case , a task no - one has accomplished yet .",
    "moreover , an interaction kernel in the ladder approximation , such as the simple gluon - exchange one that we have in the present model , is inadequate for this task even in principle .",

    "therefore , some additional ingredients or assumptions must be introduced into the present model in order to cope with the @xmath2@xmath3 system . since going beyond ladder approximation",
    "is not within the scope of the present work , the following scheme is the most sensible at this level : note that there is a standard way ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) to account for the anomaly effect by _ parametrizing _ it through the term @xmath300 added to the @xmath7 mass , since only this singlet combination ( [ eta0def ]    ) is coupled to the gluon anomaly , so that only its mass is affected by it . this corrects the @xmath5 problem arising in the mass matrix evaluated with the nonet @xmath286states @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "let us do the same in our mass matrix ( [ mabj0 ] ) : @xmath301    of course , parametrizing the effect of the gluon anomaly is far from actually calculating it unambiguously .",
    "in particular , the quantities we calculated for the @xmath7 under the assumption of nonet symmetry , @xmath107 and @xmath181 , are in fact also affected by the coupling of the gluon anomaly to @xmath7 .",
    "however , due to the large @xmath62 arguments , it makes sense to break nonet symmetry only on the level of the mass - shift parameter @xmath300 while keeping our @xmath7 built of the same @xmath302 bound - state vertices as @xmath6 , to which gluon anomaly does not couple .",
    "this is because the gluon anomaly is in the large @xmath62 limit suppressed @xcite as @xmath303 , so that in our @xmath107 and @xmath181 calculated within the nonet scheme , only the contributions of the order @xmath304 are missed .",
    "our scheme is therefore a controlled approximation on the level of large @xmath62 arguments .",

    "let us also note that our assumptions are in fact shared by many other approaches , explicitly or implicitly .",
    "_ e.g. _ , gilman and kauffman @xcite employ in their analysis nonet symmetry or broken version thereof , pointing out that it is at least implicitly assumed by all who use the quark basis not differentiating between quark states belonging to the singlet from those belonging to the octet .",
    "moreover , imposing the nonet breaking via introducing the additional parameter @xmath300 is basically the same way in which nonet symmetry is broken in the chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath45pt ) . in @xmath45pt ,",
    "one faces the problem of how to incorporate @xmath7 , shifted upwards in mass by the gluon anomaly , into the scheme that should involve goldstone pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "bijnens , bramon and cornet @xcite comment on the problems encountered when working with this ninth state , but stick to what they did earlier @xcite , namely including @xmath7 ( @xmath306 in their notation )  in a simple nonet - symmetry context \" . their ref .",
    "@xcite conveniently parametrized the nonet of ( pseudoscalar ) goldstone bosons in terms of nine fields entering in the lowest order lagrangian consistent with current algebra and explicit breaking by the quark masses , but the effect of the breaking of @xmath307 is included only via _ an extra mass term _ for @xmath7 .",
    "this is justified if one relies on large @xmath62 arguments , since @xmath7 is indeed a goldstone boson in the limit @xmath291 @xcite , and then @xmath7-mass is introduced as an extra parameter on top of that , which basically corresponds to our scheme .    precisely in the light of @xmath45pt , our result",

    "[ 2gamma].b ) , also supports our scheme .",
    "we therefore pursue the procedure of removing the @xmath5 problem by lumping the effects of the gluon anomaly into a single @xmath7-mass shift parameter @xmath300 as in ( [ add ] ) . then , with our result @xmath310 , and with the experimental pion mass @xmath311 gev ( which the present sd - bs approach readily reproduces when the strict chiral limit is relaxed @xcite ) , and with the choice @xmath312 , we get @xmath313 , which is very close to @xmath284 favored by the empirical @xmath4 widths .",

    "if @xmath269 is a state that does not couple to photons directly ( _ e.g. _ , gluonium @xmath270 ) , the results for @xmath4-decays will be modified in a particularly simple way : in formulas ( [ eta0ampl ] ) , ( [ etawidth ] ) , ( [ etaprimewidth ] ) and ( [ rratio ] ) , one should just replace @xmath385 by @xmath386 .",

    "nevertheless , it turns out that the fit to the data is still not improved as much as one would expect when an additional free parameter is introduced , so that we did not detect indications for the need for an admixture of such states to what we have in the present model .",
    "for example , our @xmath8-ratio then drops to @xmath399 .",
    "this is much further from the present central experimental value than @xmath8 predicted by our approach without glueballs , but just in case that data from future precision measurements may strongly violate our bound on the @xmath8-ratio , it is important to point out that  at least from the standpoint of our approach  such a violation would be a strong indication of the presence of some  inert \" admixture , like gluonium . at present , however , the data are consistent with the bound @xmath283 following generally from the sd ",

    "moreover , the @xmath401 width with the gluonium admixture improves only marginally , by 4% , while the @xmath402 width gets _ spoiled _ by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "we therefore conclude that we found no indication that admixtures of glueballs , or other states with similar effects on @xmath4-decays , would be favored by the present experimental data .",

    "su(3)@xmath98-breaking ratios somewhere around this interval are considered realistic because they lead to good descriptions of many hadronic properties in numerous dynamical models ; notably , close to this interval is also the ratio ( @xmath428 ) of the constituent masses @xmath429 generated by d@xmath45sb in jain and munczek s approach .",

    "now , our su(3)@xmath98-breaking is fixed by jain and munczek s @xcite choice of parameters , so that our calculated value of @xmath103 varies only if we vary @xmath300 which parametrizes the effects of the gluon anomaly . in the light of bramon and scadron s @xcite observations discussed above , and the fact that that our su(3)@xmath98-breaking leads to the ratio of strange - to - nonstrange constituent masses of 1.63 , it is understandable and expected that our constituent approach should give reasonably good description of @xmath248 for angles less negative than in @xmath45pt ; _ i.e. _ , it is no longer surprising that our preferred angle turned out to be @xmath341 .",

    "e.g. _ , in the case of the charge pion form factor calculated in in the context of sd equations , where the contribution of meson loops was estimated to be much smaller than that of the quark core @xcite .",
    "the quantities dependent on the @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing , namely axial - current decay constants @xmath360 and @xmath411 , masses and @xmath4-decay widths of @xmath2-@xmath3 , are satisfactorily close to data ( or other theoretical predictions such as @xmath45pt ) considering that  except for parametrizing the mass shift due to coupling of @xmath7 to nonabelian axial anomaly",
    " we did not do any parameter fitting , but used the parameters obtained from jain and munczek s @xcite broad fit to the meson spectrum and decay constants .",
    "we conclude that their model @xcite again performed well .    since the coupled sd - bs approach is  due to the key role of d@xmath45sb  akin to the njl model conceptually , the progress we made is best illustrated through the comparison with the analysis of the @xmath451 decays and properties of the pion , kaon and @xmath2 , performed in a njl model ( extended to include three flavors and the t hooft determinantal instanton - induced interaction ) in @xcite and in parts of @xcite .",
