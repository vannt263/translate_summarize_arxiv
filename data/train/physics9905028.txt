    "several works of anderson on localization @xcite have mostly been related to electrons transport in solids with random impureties .",
    "wolfle @xcite has proposed a diagrammatical treatment for the electronic localization in a bidimensional disordered medium .",
    "this formalism was extended to the electromagnetic waves in a volume of disordered medium @xcite , @xcite , where the impureties are modeled by dielectric spherical scatterers , and the role played by the backscattering mechanism in the energy localization was established .",
    "the physical basis of the localization is a consequence of the vanishing of diffusion coefficient of the electromagnetic wave energy , this condition was then called a localization criterion .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analytically determine several conditions on the parameters of some disordered systems ( namely , the number of scatterers , their size , permittivity , geometry , the width of the medium ) satisfying a localization criterion of the electromagnetic energy , and to show their influence on the wavelength localization domains @xcite .",
    "we give the analytic expressions of the localization criterion for a spherical or layered medium made of dielectric spheres or perfectly conducting disks .",
    "we numerically determine the sets of parameters offering ranges in wavelength where the localization criterion is satisfied .",
    "more precisely , we compute the evolution of the range when we modify every parameter , and we show that the location and the bandwitdh of these ranges may be controlled by varying some characteristic parameters of the disordered system .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction , we recall in section 2 the mathematical model used to describe the behaviour of the electromagnetic wave in a disordered medium , and the expression of a localization criterion . then in section 3",
    ", we derive analytically a localization criterion for several disordered media . in section 4 , we numerically compute the localization criterion for these media in order to determine localization domains , and we examine the influence of the system parameters on these localization domains .",
    "computations with a multidipolar formulation are used for comparison with the theoretical model .",
    "finally , section 5 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "we consider @xmath0 identical scatterers of relative permittivity @xmath1 distributed in a spatial volume @xmath2 .",

    "the background medium has a relative permittivity @xmath4 .",
    "an incident electromagnetic plane wave of pulsation @xmath5 , and wavevector @xmath6 , interacts with the set of scatterers ( figure [ fi : fig1 ] ) .    the electric field @xmath7 at location @xmath8 satisfies the helmholtz equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the wavevector in the vacuum",

    "this equation can be written in an integral form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the dyadic green function of the electromagnetic wave in the nonperturbated medium of relative permittivity @xmath4 , which satisfies the equation @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the scalar green function of the wave @xmath27 we introduce the green operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath30 the dyadic green functions are defined by the kernels of the operators . the operator @xmath31 in eq .",

    "we use the hypothesis of macroscopic homogenization of the disordered medium in order to calculate the kernel of @xmath41 , i.e. , the dyadic green function of the averaged wave . we suppose that after averaging , the medium behaves like a homogeneous one , which implies an invariance under translation . in consequence , we can first write the dyson equation ( [ dyson ] ) like a convolution equation @xmath50 the other consequence of the macroscopic homogenization hypothesis is the possibility to write a scalar form of the previous equation . indeed , the averaged medium being homogeneous , the kernel of @xmath41 may be written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the first moment of the scalar green function of the electromagnetic wave .",
    "the same consideration holds for the kernel of the self - energy operator . extracting the scalar part of eq .",
    "( [ conv ] ) , we obtain the scalar expression of the green function in fourier space @xmath53 where we notice that the invariance by translation of the averaged medium implies that the first moment of the green function and the self energy function in fourier space are only @xmath54 dependent .",
    "@xmath55 is the scalar green function of the homogenized medium .",
    "the argument of sheng @xcite is to treat the averaged medium like an effective medium , where the characteristic length of the averaged inhomogenities is small with respect to the wavelength , and therefore , they are not resolved by the wave , which explains that the averaged medium may be considered like a homogeneous one . in that case , the self - energy function @xmath38 describing the local microstructures of the medium , is weakly dependent on the variable @xmath54 , so it is treated like a pulsation dependent function @xmath56 .",

    "the averaged energy operator @xmath64 is given by the averaged tensorial product of the two green operators @xmath28 and @xmath65 , where their kernels are respectively the dyadic green function of the electromagnetic wave at pulsation @xmath66 and the conjugate complex dyadic green function at pulsation @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath5 is the central pulsation of the two dyadic green functions , and @xmath69 is their pulsation difference .",
    "we notice that @xmath69 is the conjugated variable of the time traject @xmath70 of the electromagnetic wave in the medium .",
    "the behaviour for @xmath71 of the averaged energy will be given by the behaviour of the kernel of @xmath72 when @xmath73 .",
    "the outer product @xmath74 applied on the components of the dyadic green functions is given by @xmath75    using the macroscopic homogenization hypothesis ,",

    "following the frameworks of arya@xcite and sheng @xcite , at large distances ( @xmath81 ) and large time ( @xmath73 ) , @xmath77 is governed by a diffusion - like equation @xmath82 where @xmath83,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the general energy diffusion coefficient of the wave , and @xmath84 is the boltzmann diffusion coefficient .",
    "the corrective term involved in the general expression of the diffusion coefficient is a consequence of the backscattering effect of the electromagnetic wave in the disordered medium .",
    "the energy of the electromagnetic wave is said to be localized when the general diffusion coefficient ( [ dif ] ) vanishes , i.e. the corrective term generated by the backscattering compensates the boltzmann diffusion coefficient , which gives us the condition @xmath85 @xmath86 and @xmath61 are given by the relations ( [ ke ] ) and ( [ l ] ) .",
    "this condition is called the _ localization criterion _ of the electromagnetic wave energy .",
    "we propose to derive an analytic expression of the localization criterion for an electromagnetic wave of wavelength @xmath87 interacting with the two following sets of media .    - a set of @xmath0 identical dielectric spheres of radius @xmath88 and relative permittivity @xmath89 , uniformly distributed in a spherical volume @xmath2 , or in a layered volume of thickness @xmath90 ( figure [ fi : milieu_spheres ] ) .",

    "the self - energy function in fourier space for a medium of @xmath0 identical scatterers of scattering function @xmath93 is given by @xmath94 where @xmath2 is the volume of the medium .",
    "the integral in ( [ vdelta ] ) taken over a finite volume can be approximated as @xmath95 which leads to the condition of macroscopic homogenization , because the delta distribution argument @xmath96 implies that the self - energy function is only @xmath54 dependent .      using expansions ( [ devsigma ] ) and ( [ multidif ] ) , the first and the second scattering order of the self energy operator are respectively given by the following expressions @xmath97 @xmath98 by assuming the macroscopic homogenization hypothesis",
    ", we can derive the scalar expressions of the kernels .",
    "for the second scattering order , we suppose that every scatterer receives a wave being locally plane , in that case , the scalar part of the green propagator simplifies to @xmath99 .",
    "since the @xmath0 scatterers are uniformly distributed in the volume @xmath2 , we obtain @xmath100 @xmath101 where @xmath102 @xmath103 or @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath90 must satisfy the conditions ( [ homo ] ) .",

    "we have computed the @xmath91 product as a function of the incident wavelength @xmath114 , and labeled the localization curve as @xmath115 .",
    "then we will look for the influence of the system parameters on the localization , for instance : the number @xmath0 , the width @xmath88 of the scatterers and for the case of spheres , their permittivity @xmath89 , the volume @xmath2 of the medium . in our simulations",
    ", we have supposed that the relative permittivity @xmath89 is weakly dependent on the pulsation , so we have treated it as a scalar . however , it is possible to give a description by a frequency law dependent upon the nature of the scatterer .",

    "0.1truecm we satisfy the criteria of macroscopic homogenization of the medium because in that case the ratio @xmath119 is about 25 , and so the condition @xmath120 is valid .",
    "let us notice that we are working in the range @xmath121 , and only the first term of the expansion ( [ tfonctions ] ) was used in the calcultations of the scattering function for the spheres .",

    "[ fi : permit ] , we start from the reference configuration , and we modify the relative permittivity of spheres .",
    "the curves are shown for the values : @xmath123 ( plain curve ) , @xmath124 ( dotted curve ) and @xmath125 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "when we slightly increase the relative permittivity of the spheres , the localization domain enlarges with a translation to higher wavelengths .",
    "next , we have fixed the real part of the permittivity ( @xmath126 ) , and we simulate a absorption on the surface of spheres by adding an imaginary part to the relative permittivity , so we obtain a dissipative dielectric .",

    "by adding an imaginary part to the relative permittivity , the scatterers absorb a part of the electromagnetic energy and the interactions during successive scatterings are reduced , which explains the disappearance of localization .",
    "an other interesting parameter is the density @xmath127 . indeed , when we increase the density of scatterers , we also increase the backscattering contributions from the successive interactions of the wave with scatterers , as a consequence the localization is more easily attained .",
