    "in order to place constraints on galaxy evolution in cluster environments , we present a study based on the stages survey of the abell 901/902 supercluster ( gray et al . 2008 ) at @xmath0  0.165 .",
    "the dataset includes high resolution ( @xmath4 , corresponding to @xmath5280 and @xmath6 = 70  km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 . ] pc ) @xmath1 acs f606w images , star formation rates ( sfrs ) from @xmath2 24@xmath3 ( bell et al .",
    "2007 ) data , xmm - newton x - ray data , and gravitational lensing maps ( heymans et al .",
    "2008 ) , along with accurate spectrophotometric redshifts from combo-17 ( wolf et al . 2004 ) and stellar masses ( borch et al .",
    "2006 ) .    using the cas code ( conselice et al .",
    "2000 ) , the concentration ( c ) , asymmetry ( a ) , and clumpiness ( s ) parameters were derived from @xmath1 acs f606w images . since the cas merger criteria ( a@xmath8s and a@xmath80.35 ) tend to capture only a fraction of interacting / merging galaxies ( e.g. , conselice 2006 ; jogee et al .",
    "2008a , b ) , we also resort to visual classification .",
    "we classify galaxies into three distinct visual classes : ( 1 ) galaxies with _ externally - triggered _ distortions : these are distortions that arise from tidal interactions or mergers and include features , such as double or multiple nuclei inside a common body , tidal tails , arcs , shells , ripples , or tidal debris in body of galaxy , warps , and offset rings .",
    "( 2 ) galaxies with _ internally - triggered _ asymmetries ( classified as irr-1 ) : internally - triggered asymmetries are due to stochastic star - forming regions or the low ratio of ordered to random motions , common in irregular galaxies .",
    "these asymmetries tend to be correlated on scales of a few hundred parsecs , rather than on scales of a few kpc .",
    "( 3 ) relatively _ undistorted symmetric _ galaxies ( classified as normal ) .",
    "visual classification shows that 3.3@xmath91% of galaxies",
    "brighter than m@xmath10 @xmath1118 are strongly distorted .",
    "the fraction of strongly distorted galaxies with m@xmath12 is @xmath51% .",
    "most ( 74% ) of strongly distorted galaxies lie on the blue cloud ( fig .",
    "1 , right ) . the distortion fraction in a901/02 is lower than in the field ( 7% to 9% ) for massive or bright ( jogee et al 2008a , b ; lotz et al .",
    "2008 ) galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "most strongly distorted galaxies on a901/902 lie outside the cluster cores , and avoid the peaks in dm surface mass density ( @xmath13 0.1 ) and icm density ( fig . 1 , left ) . these results are consistent with high galaxy velocity dispersions in the core being unfavorable to mergers and strong tidal interactions .      bell , e. et al .",
