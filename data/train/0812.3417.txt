    "the interplay of superfluidity ( sf ) and localization in disordered bose systems has been the subject of intense study for two decades @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical investigative effort has been focused on the quantum phase transition between a superfluid and insulating phase .",
    "for example , it has been established that disorder leads to the appearance of an ( insulating ) bose glass , sandwiched between the superfluid and mott insulating phases .",
    "this topic is enjoying continued interest , especially since cold atom physicists have recently produced controllable disorder using laser speckles  @xcite and looked at such phenomena as anderson localization of a one - dimensional condensate  @xcite and the suppression of the condensate fraction in three dimensions.@xcite    the idea of  superglass \" has come to the forefront in the context of the investigation of the ( super)solid @xmath0he . the superglass phase was initially observed in quantum monte carlo simulations , in which the superfluid phase had an inhomogeneous condensate map on a microscopic scale.@xcite biroli _",
    "_ proved that such a superglass phase does exist ( at least as a metastable phase ) by introducing an ( artificial ) model which could be mapped to a classical system of hard spheres and studied in a controlled fashion.@xcite recent experiments on solid @xmath1he have confirmed the strong interplay between a superfluid component and a slow ( glassy ) dissipative component.@xcite however , little is known yet about the superglass phase , and specifically about the actual role of disorder in promoting or enhancing superfluidity .",
    "give the current controversies and puzzles surrounding the interpretation of experiments on the possible supersolid phase of helium , further investigations of superfluid glassy phases are thus warranted .    in this work ,",
    "we provide strong numerical evidence for disorder - induced superfluidity in a lattice realization of hard - core bosons with a strong nearest - neighbor attraction , in the presence of external disorder .",
    "in particular , we show that at low temperature and in a small range of attractive interactions , disorder of sufficient strength stabilizes a  glassy \" superfluid phase .",
    "the superfluid density reaches a maximum and then decays as the strength of the disorder increases , as an insulating glassy phase intervenes .",
    "in contrast to the case of repulsive bosons where disorder reduces the size of the superfluid phase , we see that strongly attracting hard - core bosons can be stabilized and made superfluid by disorder . in other words ,",
    "disorder _ induces _ superflow in an otherwise insulating phase . aside from supersolid @xmath1he ,",
    "such a scenario is possibly relevant to other condensed matter systems , e.g. , high - temperature superconductors,@xcite as well as to the elusive superfluid phase of molecular hydrogen,@xcite and to the role of substrate disorder in the superfluidity of ( sub)monolayer helium films.@xcite",
    "we describe a disordered bose system by means of the following hamiltonian : @xmath2 we consider here a square lattice of @xmath3 sites , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the sums @xmath4 run over all pairs of nearest - neighboring lattice sites , @xmath5 @xmath6 is the bose creation ( annihilation ) operator for a particle at site @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the local density operator .",
    "the first term of ( [ ham ] ) represents the hopping of particles to nearest - neighboring sites . henceforth , we choose the hopping integral @xmath9 as our energy unit .",
    "the second term represents the interaction among bosons .",
    "hard - core _ on - site repulsion is assumed , limiting the occupation of every site to no more than one particle .",
    "for the nearest - neighbor interaction , essentially all previous work based on ( [ ham ] ) has focused on the _ repulsive _ case , i.e. @xmath10 , chiefly to elucidate the nature of the disorder - driven superfluid to insulator transition.@xcite an _ enhancement _ of superfluidity by disorder has been predicted in some cases.@xcite here , on the other hand , we consider the case of _ attractive _ nearest - neighbor interaction ( i.e. , _ negative _",
    "@xmath11 ) , and neglect interactions among particles lying at distances greater than nearest neighbors . with this choice , the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , which is essentially a lattice model of quantum  sticky \" spheres , is isomorphic to that of a spin-1/2 xxz quantum ferromagnet .",
    "we model disorder by means of a random on - site potential @xmath12 , uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath13 .",
    "other theoretical representations of a disordered environment could be considered , e.g. , one in which the hopping matrix element @xmath9 randomly varied from site to site , but in this work we restricted ourselves to the above , widely adopted _ diagonal _ model of disorder.@xcite in the spin language , the disordering potential is equivalent to a random on - site magnetic field along the @xmath14 axis .    in the absence of disorder , the ground state of ( [ ham ] ) is a superfluid for @xmath15 , whereas for @xmath16 only a mott insulating phase exists , with exactly one particle per site , regardless of lattice geometry and dimensionality .",
    "this is simply because the system can maximally lower its energy by having each particle surrounded by as many nearest - neighboring particles as possible , trumping any contribution from the hopping term .",
    "the regime of interest in this work is the latter , i.e. , that in which no superfluid phase exists in the absence of disorder .",
    "we perform grand - canonical quantum monte carlo simulations to study the ground state properties of ( [ ham ] ) , using the worm algorithm in the lattice path - integral representation.@xcite as the details of this computational method are extensively described elsewhere , and because the calculations performed here are standards , we shall not review it here , and simply refer interested readers to the original references .    the results shown here correspond to a temperature @xmath17 sufficiently low ( typically @xmath18 ) , to be regarded as essentially ground state estimates .",
    "simulations are carried out over square lattice of size varying from @xmath19=12 to @xmath19=96 , and estimates are averaged over a number @xmath20 of independent realizations of the random disordering potential , typically @xmath20=100 ( 20 ) for @xmath19=12 ( 96 ) .",

    "the superfluid density increases from zero and reaches a maximum value at half filling , where approximately 12% of the system is superfluid .",
    "obviously , numerical data such as those shown in fig . [ f2 ] must be extrapolated to the @xmath36 , in order for us to be able to male confidently the statement that superfluidity observed in these systems is not merely a finite - size effect but survives in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "[ f2 ] shows a typical extrapolation ; estimates are shown for the superfluid density obtained for a fixed particle density @xmath27 , on square lattices of different sizes ( 12 , 24 , 48 and 96 ) , for @xmath22=2.3 and @xmath23=3 .",
    "it is worth restating that these estimates are obtained by averaging results corresponding to several independent realizations of the disordering potential",
    ". based on results such as those shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , we conclude that the superfluid signal remains finite in the thermodynamic limit . in general , we have observed that results obtained on a lattice with @xmath19=96 offer a close representation of the physics of the thermodynamic limit , at least in the range of parameters discussed here",
    ".    additional numerical evidence of superfluidity is extracted from the behavior of the one - particle density matrix @xmath31 , shown in fig .",

    "statistical errors are smaller than symbol sizes .",
    "solid lines are only meant to guide the eye . ]",
    "the observed superfluid phase is ostensibly induced by disorder , which stabilizes uniform phases of filling intermediate between zero and one . in order to gain further insight and in - depth understanding of the role of disorder in actually promoting superfluidity , it is of interest to study the competition between the strength of disorder ( @xmath23 ) and that of the attractive boson interaction ( @xmath22 ) . for definiteness ,",
    "we consider the case of half filling , corresponding to a maximum in the superfluid density ( for those systems for which superfluidity is observed ) .",
    "the same trends are also observed away from half filling .    when the disorder is weak ( @xmath39 )",
    ", it can not break apart clusters of particles , hence the system remains insulating , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] or by the vanishing compressibility @xmath40 for @xmath41 in fig .",
    "there are thus macroscopic domains ( empty or fully filled ) with hidden long - range order in the system.@xcite when the disorder becomes of the order of the attraction ( @xmath42 ) , sites and regions begin to appear throughout the system where the chemical potential is low enough to rip particles off the cluster , which then breaks down into large grains .",
    "these particles , however , are still largely localized in the vicinity of the energetically favorable sites created by disorder , as the curve for @xmath43 in fig .  [ f5 ] shows .",
    "if we further increase the disorder strength , the grain size decreases to a microscopic scale , a ( relatively ) large fraction of the particles are delocalized , and superfluidity along interfaces ( ridges ) becomes possible , as also shown in previous numerical studies.@xcite this effect takes place essentially due to percolation .",
    "we can thus say that the disorder counters the insulating trend caused by the attractions , and actually makes the system superfluid .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] where we see a rather large superfluid fraction as a function of disorder . naturally , as the disorder strength",
    "is increased even further , insulating glassy behavior re - appears , because the disorder is now so strong that it can block any superfluid path and localize particles , much as in the case of repulsive interactions .",
    "a similar scenario takes place on increasing the interaction strength @xmath44 at constant disorder bound @xmath23 , as shown in fig .",
    "we have already explained the steep decay of the curve corresponding to @xmath45 above , due to the lack of carriers .",
    "when @xmath23 is greater than @xmath44 , the disorder is sufficiently strong to destroy all macroscopic domains , and superfluidity can occur all over the sample .",
    "but as the disorder becomes stronger , it prevents particle world lines from winding around the lattice . in the regime of strong disorder , both the disorder and the attractive interactions contribute to suppress superfluidity , as regions with nearly uniform chemical potential will be insulating due to the strong attraction , which pulls particles together in such regions .",
    "it is worth noting that the above scenario is quite different from that of the repulsive disordered bose - hubbard model , where regions of uniform chemical potential are crucial for stabilizing locally a liquid phase , and thus the superfluid properties and the compressibility of the whole system.@xcite we also note here that this insulating phase is compressible , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] for @xmath46 , which justifies the nomenclature ",
    "bose glass\".@xcite the compressibility at half filling goes from zero in the phase segregated regime ( no disorder ) , to a large value in the superfluid phase , and decreases then monotonically over the bose glass phase , when increasing the disorder bound at constant interaction strength .",
    "( attained for @xmath24=0.5 ) versus absolute value of attractive interaction @xmath22 for different diagonal disorder @xmath23 at inverse temperature @xmath47 .",

    "@xmath32 equals 0.068(1 ) for this run .",
    "the white areas are small insulating grains , connected by superfluid interfaces . ]",
    "this  superglass \" phase can be visualized through local superfluid density maps , shown in fig . [ f6 ] , for a particular realization of disorder .",
    "the local value is obtained by statistically averaging local contributions to the total superfluid density ( i.e. , to the square of the winding number ) , which , in the case shown in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] for @xmath28 and @xmath49 , amounts to slightly less than 7% .",
    "we found that the covariance between the superfluid density and the disordering potential is virtually zero , i.e. , for these values of the parameters the physics is mostly driven by the attraction between bosons , consistent with the picture given above in the case of strong disorder and strong attraction .",
    "we have shown that disorder induces a superfluid phase in a lattice system of hard - core bosons with a strong nearest - neighbor attraction .",
    "while the system without disorder is an insulator of the ferromagnetic ising type , the disorder can induce an inhomogeneous superfluid ( or superglass ) phase ( corresponding to in plane order in the spin parlance ) in a window of interaction and disorder strengths . for stronger disorder bounds , the disorder and",
    "the attractive interactions work together to localize the particles .",
    "the coherence induced by disorder might easily be observable in time - of - flight images for ultracold atoms or molecules . in the absence of disorder ,",
    "the physics of our model is reminiscent of that of molecular _ para_-hydrogen , long speculated to be a potential  second superfluid \" , due to the light mass of its constituents ( one half of that of helium atoms ) . on the other hand",
    ", superfluidity is not observed in _",
    "para_-hydrogen due to the strength of the intermolecular potential , which causes the system to crystalize at temperatures significantly above that at which bose condensation is expected to take place.@xcite recent numerical studies@xcite have shown that disorder ought _ not _ give rise to a superfluid phase of _ para_-hydrogen .",
    "based on the results obtained in this work , we may argue that _",
    "para_-hydrogen may be a system too  deep \" into the insulating regime ( i.e. , the effective value of @xmath44 is too large ) for disorder to stabilize a superfluid phase .",
    "on the other hand , the results obtained here suggest that disorder may be responsible for the observation of superfluidity is helium films at coverages corresponding to less than a full monolayer",
