    "emission lines of al ions are widely detected in a variety of plasmas , including solar and lasing plasmas ",
    "see for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their observation provides diagnostics for which atomic data are required for a range of parameters , such as energy levels , radiative rates ( a- values ) , and excitation rates or equivalently the effective collision strengths ( @xmath4 ) , which are obtained from the electron impact collision strengths ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "emission lines of many al ions are included in the chianti database at http://www.chiantidatabase.org/ , and for al x are listed in the 35 - 60,600 @xmath6 wavelength range in the _ atomic line list _ ( v2.04 ) of peter van hoof at @xmath7 .",
    "of particular interest are two transitions , namely 2s@xmath8 @xmath9s@xmath102s2p @xmath11p@xmath12 and 2s2p @xmath11p@xmath122p@xmath8 @xmath9d@xmath13 , at wavelengths of @xmath14 637 and 670 @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "these have been measured in solar spectra from the solar ultraviolet measurement of emitted radiation ( sumer ) instrument on board the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) .",
    "the ratio of their intensities is temperature sensitive ( landi et al .",
    "2001 ) and hence provides an excellent diagnostic .",
    "since these lines are close in wavelength , they are readily detected by a single spectrograph , thus providing an additional advantage of accuracy .",
    "unfortunately , existing atomic data for al x are very limited , particularly for collision strengths ( @xmath5 ) and effective collision strengths ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "@xcite calculated @xmath5 for 45 transitions among the lowest 10 levels of be - like ions with 8 @xmath16 z @xmath16 92 , but did not report results for al x. the only data available for @xmath4 are those of @xcite , who provided analytical expressions to derive interpolated values of @xmath4 based on @xmath17-matrix calculations for be - like ions between c iii and si xi .",
    "their results are only for transitions among the lowest 10 levels of the @xmath18=2 configurations , and are incorporated in the chianti database .",
    "no calculation has to our knowledge been performed with the @xmath17-matrix code which explicitly includes the contribution of resonances to the determination of @xmath4 .",
    "this may be highly significant , particularly for the forbidden transitions , as noted earlier for another be - like ion , i.e. ti xix @xcite .",
    "to analyse solar observations , @xcite adopted the atomic data for al x in chianti .",
    "since these data are limited to transitions within the @xmath18=2 configurations , they also calculated @xmath4 for a larger model , i.e. 98 levels of the @xmath0 4 configurations .",
    "for this they adopted the hebrew university lawrence livermore atomic code ( hullac ) of @xcite , based on the well - known and widely - used _ distorted - wave _ ( dw ) method .",
    "since resonance contributions are not normally included in dw calculations , the results for @xmath4 may be significantly underestimated .",
    "therefore , they included their contribution using the isolated resonance approximation .",
    "as a consequence , temperatures deduced from solar observations using two different sets of atomic data are significantly different , i.e. 10@xmath19 and 10@xmath20 k from chianti and hullac , respectively .",
    "the isolated resonance approximation takes into account the resonance contribution to a large extent , but @xmath4 can still be greatly underestimated , as demonstrated by @xcite for transitions in mo xxxiv and fe xxv , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xcite did not list any atomic data and these are not available on any website . therefore ,",
    "in this work we report atomic data for energy levels , a- values , @xmath5 and @xmath4 for all transitions among the lowest 98 levels of the @xmath0 4 configurations of al x. to determine the atomic structure ( i.e. calculate energy levels and a- values ) we employ the fully relativistic grasp ( general - purpose relativistic atomic structure package ) code .",
    "our version was originally developed by @xcite and is referred to as grasp0 , but has been significantly revised by one of its authors ( dr .",
    "p. h. norrington ) , and is available at the website http://web.am.qub.ac.uk / darc/. it is a fully relativistic code , based on the @xmath3 coupling scheme , and includes higher - order relativistic corrections arising from the breit ( magnetic ) interaction and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) effects ( vacuum polarisation and lamb shift ) .",
    "furthermore , as in our earlier work , we have used the option of _ extended average level _ ( eal ) . under this option a weighted ( proportional to 2@xmath21 + 1 ) trace of the hamiltonian matrix is minimised . however , the results obtained for energy levels as well as radiative rates are comparable to other options , such as _ average level _",
    "( al ) , as noted by @xcite for kr and xe ions .    for the scattering calculations",
    ", we have adopted the _",
    "dirac atomic @xmath17-matrix code _ ( darc ) of p. h. norrington and i. p. grant ( http://web.am.qub.ac.uk/darc/ ) .",
    "this is a relativistic version of the standard @xmath17-matrix code and is based on the @xmath3 coupling scheme .",
    "for this reason , the accuracy of calculated data ( for @xmath5 and subsequently @xmath4 ) should be higher , particularly for transitions among the _ fine - structure _ levels of a state , because resonances through the energies of degenerating levels are also taken into account .",
    "the lowest 98 levels of al x belong to the 17 configurations : ( 1s@xmath8 ) 2@xmath222@xmath23 , 2@xmath223@xmath23 and 2@xmath224@xmath23 .",
    "our level energies calculated from grasp , _ without _ and _ with _ the inclusion of breit and qed effects , are listed in table 1 .",
    "@xcite have compiled and critically evaluated experimentally - measured energy levels of al x , which are available at the nist ( national institute of standards and technology ) website http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/asd.cfm , and included in table 1 for comparison . however , nist energies are not available for many levels , particularly of the 2@xmath224@xmath23 configurations , and for some of the levels their results are the same ( i.e. non degenerate ) ",
    "see for example : the 2s4f @xmath11f@xmath24 levels . also included in the table , for comparison purpose , are energies obtained from the _ flexible atomic code _",
    "( fac ) code of @xcite .",
    "these results listed under fac1 include the same ci ( configuration interaction ) as in grasp .",
    "the inclusion of the breit and qed effects ( grasp2 ) does not significantly alter the energies obtained with their exclusion ( grasp1 ) , as both sets of results agree within 0.01 ryd , and their orderings are also the same .",
    "similarly , there is no discrepancy in the ordering of levels between grasp and nist , and the energy differences for common levels are generally within 0.01 ryd .",
    "however , particularly for two levels , namely 2p3s @xmath9p@xmath12 and 2p3d @xmath9f@xmath25 , the nist energies are higher by up to 0.06 ryd .",
    "for some of the levels , including 2p3s @xmath9p@xmath12 , the nist energies are not highly accurate as they have placed a question mark on these .",
    "our fac1 energies show the same ordering as those of grasp and nist , and agree with our grasp2 calculations within 0.05 ryd .",
    "the inclusion of the 2@xmath225@xmath23 configurations , labelled fac2 calculations in table 1 , makes no appreciable difference .",
    "small discrepancies in the grasp and fac energies , also noted for several other ions , are primarily due to the different ways that the calculations of central potential for radial orbitals and recoupling schemes of angular parts have been performed  see the detailed discussion in the fac manual ( ) .",
    "however , for the levels in common our grasp2 energies are slightly closer to those of nist than those from fac . therefore , based on the comparisons shown ,",
    "our grasp2 energy levels listed in table 1 are assessed to be accurate to better than 0.3% .",
    "since the a- values of @xcite are limited to e1 transitions among the lowest 10 levels of al x , we here provide a complete set of data for all transitions among the 98 levels .",
    "furthermore , a- values are calculated for four types of transitions , namely electric dipole ( e1 ) , electric quadrupole ( e2 ) , magnetic dipole ( m1 ) , and magnetic quadrupole ( m2 ) .",
    "generally , e1 transitions are dominant , but occasionally other types of transitions are also prominent and are therefore required for a complete plasma model . the absorption oscillator strength",
    "( @xmath26 ) and radiative rate a@xmath27 ( in s@xmath28 ) for all types of transition @xmath29 are related by the following expression @xcite :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the electron mass and charge , respectively , @xmath33 the velocity of light , @xmath34 the transition energy / wavelength in @xmath15 , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 the statistical weights of the lower ( @xmath37 ) and upper ( @xmath21 ) levels , respectively . however , the relationships between oscillator strength f@xmath38 ( dimensionless ) and the line strength s ( in atomic unit , 1 a.u .",
    "= 6.460@xmath110@xmath39 cm@xmath8 esu@xmath8 ) with the a- values are different for different types of transitions ",
    "( 25 ) of @xcite .",
    "in table 2 we list transition energies / wavelengths ( @xmath41 , in @xmath15 ) , radiative rates ( a@xmath27 , in s@xmath28 ) , oscillator strengths ( f@xmath38 , dimensionless ) , and line strengths ( s , in a.u . ) for all 1468 electric dipole ( e1 ) transitions among the 98 levels of al x. for conciseness , results are only listed in the length form , which are considered to be more accurate .",
    "however , below we discuss the velocity / length form ratio , as this provides some assessment of the accuracy of the results . also note that the _ indices _ used to represent the lower and upper levels of a transition are defined in table 1 .",
    "there are 1754 electric quadrupole ( e2 ) , 1424 magnetic dipole ( m1 ) , and 1792 magnetic quadrupole ( m2 ) transitions among the same 98 levels .",
    "however , for these only the a - values are listed in table 2 , and the corresponding results for f- values can be easily obtained through eq .",
    "as noted in section 1 , f - values for al x are available in the literature @xcite for only a limited number of transitions .",
    "therefore , as with energy levels we have also performed a calculation with the fac code of @xcite .",
    "our calculated f- values from both grasp and fac , as well as their ratio , are listed in table 3 for some representative transitions among the lowest 20 levels of al x. for these transitions the agreement between the two sets of f- values is better than 20% , particularly for the strong ones with f @xmath42 0.01 . however , there are 4 exceptions , namely 2171 ( 2p3s @xmath11p@xmath43 ",
    "2p4p @xmath11p@xmath44 ) , 3185 ( 2p3p @xmath11p@xmath44  2p4d @xmath11p@xmath45 ) , 4676 ( 2p3d @xmath9p@xmath12 ",
    "2p4p @xmath9d@xmath13 ) , and 4682 ( 2p3d @xmath9p@xmath12  2p4f @xmath11f@xmath13 ) , for which the discrepancies are larger , but still less than 50%",
    ". these discrepancies are partly due to the corresponding differences in the energy levels of the two calculations .    a general criterion to assess the accuracy of f- or a- values is to compare the ratio of their length and velocity forms",
    ". this should ideally be close to unity but often is not , because the two formulations are not exactly the same .",
    "therefore , we also include in table 3 the ratio of the velocity and length forms . for a majority ( 89% ) of the strong e1 transitions",
    "( f @xmath42 0.01 ) the ratio is within 20% of unity , but discrepancies for some are higher , although mostly within a factor of two .",
    "however , for a few ( @xmath14 8% ) weak(er ) transitions ( f @xmath16 10@xmath46 ) the two forms of the f- value differ by up to several orders of magnitude ",
    "see for example : 3437 , 5658 , 67 - 75 , and 7173 .",
    "for all of these transitions , @xmath47e@xmath38 is very low and a small variation in this has a large effect on the f- value .",
    "a few other transitions with significant @xmath47e@xmath38 for which the two forms disagree by over 20% are : 312 ( f @xmath14 10@xmath48 ) , 615 ( f @xmath14 10@xmath46 ) , and 1015 ( f @xmath14 10@xmath49 ) , as shown in table 3 . finally ,",
    "as noted for the energy levels in section 2 , inclusion of additional ci with the @xmath18 = 5 configurations does not make any appreciable effect on the f- or a- values . to be specific ,",
    "discrepancies in a- values for all strong e1 transitions are less than @xmath14 20% with those listed in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "therefore , based on this and other comparisons already discussed , we are confident that for almost all strong e1 transitions listed in table 2 , our f- values ( and other related parameters ) are accurate to better than 20% .",
    "however , for the weaker e1 and other types of transitions ( i.e. e2 , m1 and m2 ) the accuracy may be comparatively lower .",
    "finally , we note that these conclusions are similar to those arrived earlier for transitions of another be - like ion , i.e. ti xix @xcite .",
    "the lifetime @xmath50 for a level @xmath21 is defined as follows ( woodgate 1970 ) :    @xmath51    since this is a measurable quantity , it facilitates an assessment of the accuracy of the a- values .",
    "therefore , in table 1 we have also listed our calculated lifetimes .",
    "generally , a- values for e1 transitions dominate , but for higher accuracy we have also included the contributions from e2 , m1 and m2 .",
    "their inclusion is particularly useful for those levels which do not connect via e1 transitions . @xcite",
    "have measured the lifetime of the 2s2p @xmath9p@xmath12 level to be 175@xmath5215 ps , which compares very well with our result of 160 ps and the 173 ps theoretical value of andersson et al .",
    "they have also measured lifetimes corresponding to the 2s2p @xmath9p@xmath122p@xmath8 @xmath9d@xmath13 ( 59 ) and 2s2p @xmath9p@xmath122p@xmath8 @xmath9s@xmath10 ( 510 ) transitions to be 1080@xmath5280 and 112@xmath5212 ps , respectively , which compare favourably with our results of 1072 and 105 ps , respectively .",
    "the collision strength for electron impact excitation ( @xmath5 ) is related to the better - known parameter collision cross section ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) by the following equation @xcite :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the incident energy of the electron and @xmath35 is the statistical weight of the initial state . since @xmath5 is a symmetric and dimensionless quantity , results for it are preferred over those of @xmath53 .    as in our earlier work , such as on ti xix @xcite , for calculating @xmath5",
    "we have adopted the _",
    "dirac atomic @xmath17-matrix code _ ( darc ) of p. h. norrington and i. p. grant , available at the website http://web.am.qub.ac.uk / darc/. this code includes the relativistic effects , which are very important for high z ions , but are equally significant for taking into account degeneracy among the fine - structure levels of a state of an ion with lower z , such as al x. the darc code is based on the @xmath3 coupling scheme and uses the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian in an @xmath17-matrix approach .",
    "the @xmath17-matrix radius adopted for al x is 6.4 au , and 55 continuum orbitals have been included for each channel angular momentum in the expansion of the wavefunction .",
    "this large expansion is computationally more demanding but allows us to compute @xmath5 up to an energy of 380 ryd , @xmath14355 ryd _ above _ the highest threshold considered in this work .",
    "furthermore , this large energy range is sufficient to calculate values of effective collision strength @xmath4 ( see section 6 ) up to t@xmath57 = 1.8 @xmath110@xmath58 k , more than an order of magnitude higher than the temperature of maximum abundance in ionisation equilibrium for al x , i.e. 1.3 @xmath110@xmath59 k @xcite . the maximum number of channels for a partial wave is 428 and the corresponding size of the hamiltonian matrix is 23,579 . to achieve convergence of @xmath5 for a majority of transitions and at all energies , we have included all partial waves with angular momentum @xmath60 40.5 .",
    "additionally , to account for higher neglected partial waves , we have included a top - up , based on the coulomb - bethe @xcite and geometric series approximations for allowed and forbidden transitions , respectively .",
    "these contributions enhance the accuracy of our calculated values of @xmath5s , particularly at the higher end of the energy range .",
    "in table 4 we list our values of @xmath5 for resonance transitions of al x at energies _ above _ thresholds .",
    "the indices used to represent the levels of a transition have already been defined in table 1 .",
    "unfortunately , no similar data are available for comparison purposes as already noted in section 1 .",
    "one way to assess the accuracy of these results is to compare with the similar calculations from fac , as undertaken in our work on ti xix @xcite .",
    "however , such a comparison is not very useful , particularly for the forbidden transitions , because often there are anomalies in the fac calculations , as shown in fig .",
    "6 of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our listed results for @xmath5 should be helpful for future comparisons .",
    "as well as energy levels and radiative rates , excitation and de - excitation rates are required for plasma modelling , which are determined from the collision strengths ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "however , @xmath5 does not vary smoothly with increasing energy , particularly at energies in between the thresholds .",
    "the threshold energy region is generally dominated by numerous closed - channel ( feshbach ) resonances , especially for ( semi ) forbidden transitions .",
    "therefore , values of @xmath5 should be calculated in a fine energy mesh to accurately account for their contribution .",
    "additionally , in many plasmas electrons have a wide distribution of velocities , and therefore it is more appropriate to average values of @xmath5 over a suitable distribution . for astrophysical applications",
    "the most appropriate and commonly used distribution is _ maxwellian _ , although any other distribution may also be applied if suitable for a particular plasma .",
    "such an averaged value , known as _ effective _ collision strength ( @xmath4 ) @xcite is :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is boltzmann constant , t@xmath57 electron temperature in k , and e@xmath63 the electron energy with respect to the final ( excited ) state .",
    "once the value of @xmath4 is known the corresponding results for the excitation q(i , j ) and de - excitation q(j , i ) rates can be easily obtained from the following equations :    @xmath64    and @xmath65 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the statistical weights of the initial ( @xmath37 ) and final ( @xmath21 ) states , respectively , and e@xmath38 is the transition energy .",
    "the contribution of resonances often enhances the values of @xmath4 over those of the background collision strengths ( @xmath66 ) , particularly for the ( semi ) forbidden transitions .",
    "this enhancement can be dominant ( by up to an order of magnitude or even more ) , but depends on the type of a transition as well as the temperature .",
    "generally , the enhancement in @xmath4 is greater at lower temperatures .",
    "similarly , values of @xmath5 should be calculated over a wide energy range ( above thresholds ) to obtain convergence of the integral in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "7 of @xcite .",
    "if calculations of @xmath5 are performed only for a limited range of energy , it is still necessary to include the contribution of @xmath5 at high energies . for this",
    "the high energy limits recommended by @xcite for a range of transitions may be adopted . however ,",
    "in our work there is no such need because calculations for @xmath5 have already been performed up to sufficiently high energies , as clarified in section 5 .    to delineate resonances ,",
    "we have performed our calculations of @xmath5 at over @xmath14 13,000 energies in the thresholds region .",
    "close to thresholds ( @xmath140.1 ryd above a threshold ) the energy mesh is 0.001 ryd , and away from thresholds is 0.002 ryd .",
    "this fine resolution accounts for the majority of resonances , and their density and importance can be appreciated from transitions of ti xix shown in figs .",
    "712 of @xcite . for transitions of al x",
    "we observe similar dense resonances , as shown in figs . 1 and 2 for two important lines , namely 2s@xmath8 @xmath9s@xmath102s2p @xmath11p@xmath12 ( 13 ) and 2s2p @xmath11p@xmath122p@xmath8 @xmath9d@xmath13 ( 39 )",
    ". both of these are allowed transitions in @xmath3 coupling and yet resonances are not only dense but also highly significant in magnitude .",
    "furthermore , resonances are spread over a range of 20 ryd ( equivalently over 3@xmath110@xmath67 k ) , and hence make an appreciable contribution to @xmath4 over the entire range of temperatures of interest for transitions of al x.    our calculated values of @xmath4 are listed in table 5 over a wide temperature range up to 10@xmath68 k , suitable for applications to a wide range of laboratory and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "corresponding data at any desired temperature can either be easily interpolated , because @xmath4 is a slowly varying function of t@xmath57 , or may be requested from the first author .",
    "as noted in section 1 , @xcite have reported values of @xmath4 for transitions among the lowest 10 levels of al x. in table 6 we compare results for @xmath4 at three temperatures of 10@xmath69 , 10@xmath70 and 10@xmath71 k , which are most relevant for al x @xcite .",
    "the interpolated values of @xmath4 listed by keenan et al . are based on the @xmath17-matrix calculations for c iii , o v , ne vii and si xi , which were performed in @xmath72 coupling . since their work is not based on direct calculations for al x , differences with their results are not unexpected . for transitions which are allowed in @xmath72 coupling , such as 15 and 59/10 , there is no discrepancy between our results and those of keenan et al .",
    "this is because such allowed transitions do not normally have a significant contribution from resonances .",
    "however , there are differences between the two sets of @xmath4 of up a factor of two for several ( but not all ) transitions which are allowed in @xmath72 coupling but not in @xmath3 , such as 2/3/46/7/8 , i.e. 2s2p @xmath11p@xmath73  2p@xmath8 @xmath11p@xmath74 . for other transitions ( particularly forbidden ) the @xmath4 values of keenan et al . are _ underestimated _ by up to a factor of 4 .",
    "energies and lifetimes for the lowest 98 levels of al x belonging to the @xmath0 4 configurations have been reported , for which the grasp code has been adopted .",
    "also listed are results for radiative rates for four types of transitions ( e1 , e2 , m1 and m2 ) . based on a variety of comparisons with available measurements , as well as with analogous calculations with the fac code ,",
    "our results for radiative rates , oscillator strengths and line strengths are judged to be accurate to better than 20% for a majority of strong transitions .",
    "similarly , energy levels are assessed to be accurate to @xmath140.3% .",
    "measurements of lifetimes are available for only three levels for which there are no discrepancies with theory .",
    "results have also been reported for collision strengths over a wide range of energy , but only for resonance transitions . however , corresponding results for effective collision strengths are listed for _ all _ transitions among the 98 levels of al x and over a wide range of temperature , suitable for applications in a variety of plasmas . for calculations of @xmath4 ,",
    "resonances in the thresholds energy region for many transitions are noted to be as dominant as for ti xix @xcite .",
    "their inclusion in the determination of @xmath4 has significantly enhanced the results . since no prior calculations with comparable accuracy and complexity are available",
    ", it is not straightforward to assess the uncertainty of our values of @xmath4 .",
    "however , comparisons between our results and those interpolated by @xcite have been made for transitions among the lowest 10 levels , and the latter are found to be underestimated by up to a factor of four for several transitions , mostly forbidden .    since",
    "a large range of partial waves has been considered to achieve convergence of @xmath5 at all energies and contribution of higher neglected partial waves has been included , our results for @xmath5 should be accurate to better than 20% .",
    "this assessment of accuracy is mainly based on comparisons of similar data for be - like ion of ti . similarly , to calculate values of @xmath4 up to t@xmath57 = 10@xmath68 k ,",
    "we have included a wide energy range for @xmath5 and have also resolved resonances in a fine energy mesh to account for their contribution .",
    "hence , we see no apparent limitations in our data . moreover , as for ti xix @xcite",
    ", we estimate the accuracy of our results for @xmath4 to be better than 20% for most transitions",
    ". however , there is scope for improvement , especially for transitions involving levels of the @xmath18 = 4 configurations .",
    "this can perhaps be achieved by the inclusion of levels of the @xmath18 = 5 configurations in the collisional calculations . at present",
    "we believe the reported results for radiative and excitation rates for transitions in al x are the most exhaustive and accurate available to date .",
    "the complete set of atomic data should be highly useful for modelling astrophysical and fusion plasmas .",
