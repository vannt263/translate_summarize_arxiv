    "random loop approaches to quantum spin systems offer an elegant and different perspective to quantum correlations .",
    "they find their origin in feynman - kac representations of quantum lattice systems .",
    "motivated by earlier work of conlon and solovej @xcite , tth introduced a representation of the @xmath1 ferromagnetic heisenberg model that is based on the random interchange model @xcite .",
    "it allowed him to propose a bound for the free energy ( it has been improved recently by correggi , giuliani , and seiringer @xcite , who have reached the best possible constant ) .",
    "a similar representation was introduced by aizenman and nachtergaele for the @xmath1 antiferromagnet model @xcite and certain models with higher spins .",
    "it allowed them to relate the one - dimensional quantum chain to two - dimensional potts and random cluster models , yielding new insights on the quantum spin chain .",
    "this work was reviewed and extended in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a pedagogical introduction .",
    "recently , bachmann and nachtergaele used the representation in their study of the classification of gapped ground states @xcite .",
    "a synthesis of these two representations was proposed in @xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath1 , it applies to models that interpolate between the heisenberg ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic models such as the quantum @xmath0 model .",
    "it also applies to certain su(2)-invariant models of spin 1 .",
    "thanks to this representation , the existence of spin nematic long - range order was established in the model with @xmath2 in dimension @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it also plays a rle in the recent proof of emptyness formation of quantum spin chains of crawford , ng , and starr @xcite .",
    "this article reviews some of the material treated in @xcite , and also complements it .",
    "we consider the case of an external magnetic field , possibly disordered .",
    "we detail formul for the matrix elements of the operator @xmath4 and use them to calculate correlation functions .",
    "since there are few loop correlation functions , and seemingly more quantum spin correlation functions , the relations provide useful identities ; these identities do not seem otherwise immediate .",
    "let @xmath5 be a graph , with @xmath6 the ( finite ) set of vertices and @xmath7 the set of edges .",

    "they satisfy the commutation relations @xmath14 = { { \\rm i}}\\delta_{x , y } s_{x}^{3}$ ] , and further relations obtained by cyclic permutations of the indices @xmath15 .",
    "recall that `` classical configurations '' @xmath16 form a basis of @xmath17 where the operators @xmath18 are diagonal : using dirac s notation , s_x^3 |= _ x | .",
    "we consider the three operators @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 on @xmath22 ( and their extensions on @xmath17 by identifying @xmath19 with @xmath23 , etc ... ) :    * @xmath19 is the transposition operator : t_xy |a , b= |b , a .",

    "the gibbs operator @xmath69 can be expanded in random loops and `` space - time spin configurations '' ( see next section ) , which gives a sort of classical model that is reflection positive .",
    "this allows to prove `` gaussian domination '' , leading to infrared bounds for the duhamel two - point function . combining with the falk - bruch inequality , as in @xcite , one obtains theorem [ thm lolo ] .",
