    "this space has an obvious @xmath0 action .",
    "the problem we address in this paper is to associate an equivariant virtual fundamantal class to this moduli space .",

    "( see @xcite . ) )    in the symplectic case , the virtual fundamental class @xmath10 $ ] was established in the year 1996 by several groups of mathematicians ( @xcite . ) its equivariant version is discussed by various people .",
    "however the foundation of such equivariant version are not so much transparent in the literature .    in case @xmath11",
    "is a lagrangian submanifold which is @xmath0-invariant , we can discuss a similar problem to define a virtual fundamental chain of the moduli space of bordered @xmath4-holomorphic curves , especially disks .",
    "equivariant virtual fundamental chain is used to define equivariant version of lagrangian floer theory .",
    "equivariant kuranishi structure on the moduli space of pseudo - holomorphic curve in a manifold with group action , have been used in several places already .",
    "for example it is used in a series of papers the author wrote with joint authors @xcite,@xcite and etc . which studies the case when @xmath1 is a toric manifold and @xmath0 is the torus .",
    "the construction of equivariant kuranishi structure in such a situation is written in detail in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 4 - 3,4 - 4,4 - 5 ) .",
    "the construction there uses the fact that the lagrangian submanifold @xmath11 is a single orbit of the group action , which is free on @xmath11 , and also the fact that the group @xmath0 is abelian .",
    "the argument there is rather ad - hoc and by this reason seems to be rather complicated , though it is correct .    in this paper",
    "the author provides a result which is the most important part of the construction of @xmath0-equivariant virtual fundamental cycle and chain on the moduli space @xmath5",
    ".    we will prove the following :    [ thm11 ] for each @xmath12 there exists @xmath13 such that :    1 .",
    "@xmath14 is a finite dimensional smooth and effective orbifold .",
    "the group @xmath0 has a smooth action on it .",
    "2 .   @xmath15 is a smooth vector bundle ( orbibundle ) on @xmath14 .",

    "see section [ sec : eqkurachar ] theorem [ thm54 ] for the precise statement .",
    "we can glue those charts and obtain a @xmath0-equivariant kuranishi structure .",
    "we can also prove a similar result in the case of the moduli space of pseudo - holomorphic curves from bordered curve .",
    "however in this paper we focus on the construction of the @xmath0-equivariant kuranishi chart on @xmath20 .",
    "in fact this is the part where we need something novel compared to the case without @xmath0 action .",
    "once we obtain a @xmath0-equivariant kuranishi chart at each point , the rest of the construction is fairly analogous to the case without @xmath0 action .",
    "so to reduce the length of this paper we do not address the problem of constructing global @xmath0-equivariant kuranishi structure but restrict ourselves to the construction of @xmath0-equivariant kuranishi chart .",
    "( actually the argument of subsection [ indsmoothchart ] contains a large portion of the construction of global kuranishi structure . )",
    "joyce s approach @xcite on virtual fundamental chain , especially the idea using certain kinds of universality to construct finite dimensional reduction , which joyce explained in his talk @xcite , if it works successsfully , has advantage to work out the equivariant version , ( since in this approach the kuranishi chart obtained is ` canonical ' in certain sense and so its @xmath0 equivariance could be automatic . )    if one takes infinite dimensional approach for virtual fundamental chain such as those in @xcite , one does not need the process to take finite dimensional reduction .",
    "so the main issue of this paper ( to perform finite dimensional reduction in a @xmath0 equivariant way ) may be absent . on the other hand",
    ", then one needs to develop certain frame work to study equivariant cohomology in such infinite dimensional situation .",

    "2 .   for each @xmath27 which is ` close ' to the @xmath0-orbit of @xmath28 we find @xmath34 such that the distance between @xmath35 and @xmath36 is smallest .",
    "we move @xmath37 to a subspace of @xmath38 by @xmath6 action and then move it to @xmath39 by an appropriate parallel transportation .",
    "there are problems to carry out step ( 2 ) and step ( 3 ) .",
    "note we need to consider the equivalence class of @xmath28 with respect to an appropriate isomorphisms . by this reason the parametrization of the source curve @xmath40 is well - defined only up to certain isomorphism group .",
    "this causes a problem in defining the notion of closeness in ( 2 ) and defining the way how to move our obstruction bundle @xmath37 by a parallel transportation in ( 3 ) .    in case",
    "@xmath22 is stable , the ambiguity , that is , the group of automorphisms of this marked curve , is a finite group . using the notion of multisection ( or multivalued perturbation ) which was introduced in @xcite",
    ", we can go around the problem of this ambiguity of the identification of the source curve .    in the case when @xmath22 is unstable ( but @xmath28 is stable ) , the problem is more nontrivial . in @xcite ,",
    "fukaya - ono provide two methods to resolve this problem .",
    "one of the methods , which is discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) , uses additional marked points @xmath41 so that @xmath42 becomes stable .",

    "including extra marked points",
    "@xmath41 breaks the symmetry of @xmath0 action .",
    "for example suppose there is @xmath45 and a @xmath46 parametrized family of automorphisms @xmath47 of @xmath22 such that @xmath48 then we can not take @xmath41 which is invariant under this @xmath46 action .",
    "this causes a trouble to define obstruction spaces @xmath37 satisfying ( [ form11 ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we use a different way to resolve the problem appearing in the case when @xmath22 is unstable .",
    "this method was written in @xcite especially in its sections 13 and 15 . during these 20 years",

    "* appendix ) .",
    "the author however recently realized that for the purpose of constructing the family of obstruction spaces @xmath37 in a @xmath0 equivariant way , the method of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 13 and 15 ) is useful .",
    "let us briefly explain this second method .",
    "we fix @xmath40 and take obstruction space @xmath37 on it .",
    "let @xmath27 be an element which is ` close ' to @xmath49 for some @xmath50 . to carry out steps ( 2)(3 ) we need to find a way to fix a diffeomorphism @xmath51 at least on the support of @xmath37 . if @xmath22 is stable we can find such identification @xmath51 up to finite ambiguity . in case @xmath22",
    "is unstable the ambiguity is actually controlled by the group of automorphisms of @xmath22 , which has positive dimension .",
    "the idea is to choose certain identification @xmath51 together with @xmath6 such that the distance between @xmath35 with this identification and @xmath36 is smallest among all the choices of the identification @xmath51 and @xmath50 .    to work out this idea",
    ", we need to make precise what we mean by ` the ambiguity is controlled by the group of automorphisms ' . in @xcite",
    "certain ` action ' of a group germ is used for this purpose . here",
    "` action ' is in a quote since it is not actually an action .",
    "( @xmath52 does _ not _ hold .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lines above lemma 13.22 ) . )",
    "though the statements and the proofs ( of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemmata 13.18 and 13.22 ) ) provided there are rigorous and correct , as is written there , the notion of `` ` action ' of group germ '' is rather confusing .",
    "recently the author realized that the notion of `` ` action ' of group germ '' can be nicely reformulated by using the language of lie groupoid .",
    "in our generalization to the @xmath0 equivariant cases , which is related to a rather delicate problem of equivariant transversality , rewriting the method of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 13 and 15 ) using the language of lie groupoid seems meaningful for the author .    in section [ sec : groupoid ] we review the notion of lie groupoid in the form we use . then in section [ sec : universal ] we construct a ` universal family of deformation of a marked curve ' including the case when the marked curve is unstable",
    ". such universal family does not exist in the usual sense for unstable curve .",
    "however we can still show the unique existence of such universal family in the sense of deformation parametrized by a lie groupoid .",
    "[ thn12 ] for any marked nodal curve @xmath22 ( which is not necessary stable ) there exists uniquely a universal family of deformations of @xmath22 parametrized by a lie groupoid .",
    "see section [ sec : universal ] theorem [ them35 ] for the precise statement .",
    "this result may have independent interest other than its application to the proof of theorem [ thm11 ] .",
    "we remark that the lie groupoid appearing in theorem [ thn12 ] is tale if and only if @xmath22 is stable .",
    "so in the case of our main interest where @xmath22 is not stable , the lie groupoid we study is _ not _ an tale groupoid or an orbifold .",
    "the universal family in theorem [ thn12 ] should be related to a similar universal family defined in algebraic geometry based on artin stack .",
    "theorem [ thn12 ] provides the precise formulation of the fact that ` identification of @xmath40 with @xmath53 is well defined up to automorphism group of @xmath22 ' .    using theorem [ thn12 ] we carry out the idea mentioned above and construct a family of obstruction spaces @xmath29 satisfying ( [ form11 ] ) in sections [ sec : obstruction ] and [ sec : main ] .",
    "once we obtain @xmath29 the rest of the construction is similar to the case without @xmath0 action .",
    "however since the problem of constructing equivariant kuranishi chart is rather delicate one , we provide detail of the process of constructing equivariant kuranishi chart in section [ sec : decay ] .",
    "most of the argument of section [ sec : decay ] is taken from @xcite .",
    "certain exponential decay estimate of the solution of pseudo - holomorphic curve equation ( especially the exponential decay estimate of its derivative with respect to the gluing parameter ) is crucial to obtain a smooth kuranishi structure .",
    "( in our equivariant situation , obtaining _ smooth _ kuranishi structure is more essential than the case without group action .",
    "this is because in the @xmath0 equivariant case it is harder to apply certain trick of algebraic or differential topology to reduce the construction to the study of @xmath54 or @xmath55 dimensional moduli spaces . )",
    "this exponential decay estimate is proved in detail in @xcite .",
    "other than this point , our discussion is independent of the papers we have written on the foundation of virtual fundamental chain technique and is selfcontained .",
    "the author is planning to apply the result of this paper to several problems .",
    "it includes , the definition of equivariant lagrangian floer homology and of equivariant gromov - witten invariant , relation of equivariant lagrangian floer theory to the lagrangian floer theory of the symplectic quotient .",
