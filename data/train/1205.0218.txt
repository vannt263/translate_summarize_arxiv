    "anisotropic properties of the nematic liquid crystals ( nlc ) give rise to a new class of colloidal elastic anisotropic interactions that never occur in isotropic hosts and result in different structures of colloidal particles : linear chains @xcite , inclined chains with respect to the director @xcite-@xcite and quasi 2d nematic colloids @xcite-@xcite .",
    "theoretical understanding of the matter in the bulk nlc is based on the multipole expansion of the director field and has deep electrostatic analogies .",
    "untill now , all theoretical models dealt with only the first three terms in multipole expansion : coulomb - like @xcite , dipole and quadrupole @xcite-@xcite . almost all experiments are made with axially symmetric colloidal particles ( primarily spherical ) which carry only dipole and/or quadrupole elastic moments .",
    "but considering only these two terms can not explain quantitatively any of the observed structures .",
    "for instance the droplets with tangential boundary conditions make an angle of @xmath9 with the alignment axis of the liquid crystal @xcite , which is along the vertical axis .",
    "however , the quadrupole interaction gives the angle , for which long - range attraction is maximized to be approximately @xmath10 .",
    "therefore the origin of the existing structures must be ascribed to the short - range effects , not explicitly included in the theory .    in the current paper",
    "it is found that high order multipole terms play a very important role in the short - range effects and in the formation of colloidal structures .",
    "actually we find that there are three zones around each colloidal particle : the first zone is the zone of topological defects where non - linear terms are essential .",
    "it has the approximate size of @xmath11 of the particle radius @xmath0 , so that it is concentrated on the distances @xmath12 .",
    "the second zone is the intermediate zone , where all possible from the symmetry point of view elastic terms , are born simultaneously and higher order elastic terms are essential ( from 10% to 60% of the total deformations ) .",
    "it is concentrated at the approximate distances @xmath2 .",
    "and the third zone is the zone of the last multipole moment , where higher order terms make contribution less than 10% and only the last multipole moment has the dominant value .",
    "this third zone extends to distances @xmath13 .",
    "we will now consider the case of spherical particles with planar anchoring conditions as an example .",
    "such particles have topological defects called boojums at the poles . we find that boojums can be effectively described via multipole expansion with accuracy up to @xmath4 and the whole spherical particle can be effectively considered as multipole of the order 6 with multipolarity equal @xmath5 .",
    "the correspondent elastic interaction between two beads with higher order elastic terms gives the angle @xmath6 of minimum energy between two contact beads which is close to the experimental value of @xmath7 .",
    "let s now consider axially symmetric particle of the micron or sub - micron size which may carry topological defects such as hyperbolic hedgehog , disclination ring or boojums . in the absence of the particle",
    "the non - deformed state of nlc is the orientation of the director @xmath14 .",
    "the immersed particle induces deformations of the director in the perpendicular directions @xmath15 and make director field @xmath16 .",
    "the bulk energy of deformation may be approximately written in the harmonic form : @xmath17 with euler - lagrange equations of laplace type : @xmath18 then the director field outside the particle in the infinite lc has the form @xmath19 in the simplest case with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being dipole and quadrupole elastic moments .",
    "the anharmonic correction to the bulk energy is @xmath22 which changes el equations to be : @xmath23 if the leading contribution to @xmath24 is the dipolar term then anharmoic corrections are of the form @xmath25 and high order terms of the order up to @xmath26 can effectively influence on the short - range behaviour and should be equally considered . the same",
    "if the leading contribution to @xmath24 is the quadrupolar term then anharmonic corrections are of the form @xmath27 and high order terms of the order up to @xmath28 can effectively influence the short - range behaviour .    in the general case , the solution of the laplace equation for axially symmetric particles has the form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the multipole moment of the order @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the multipolarity ; @xmath33 - is the maximum possible order without anharmonic corrections . for the dipole particle @xmath34 , for the quadrupole particle @xmath35 .",
    "so @xmath36 is the dipole moment , @xmath37 - is the quadrupole moment .",
    "actually , all odd coefficients are equal to zero for quadrupole particles @xmath38 because of the horisontal symmetry plane so that it can be limited with @xmath39 .",
    "all nonzero coefficiants @xmath30 are unknown quantities .",
    "they can be found as asymptotics from exact solutions or from variational ansatzes . strictly speaking these coefficients are functions of the anchoring coefficient @xmath40 and surface elastic constants @xmath41 as well as the frank elastic constant @xmath42 and particle radius @xmath0 .",
    "but we do nt exactly know this dependence . from the other side the coefficients",
    "@xmath30 may be found as fitting parameters in the interaction potentials for each particular case .    in order to find the energy of the system : particle(s ) + lc , it is necessary to introduce some effective free energy functional @xmath43 so that it s euler - lagrange equations would have the above solutions ( [ hn ] ) . in the one constant approximation with frank constant @xmath42",

    "<S> theoretical description of the elastic interaction between colloidal particles in nlc with incorporation of the higher order elastic terms beyond the limit of dipole and qudrupole interactions is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for the elastic interaction potential between axially symmetric colloidal particles , taking into account of the high order elastic terms , is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the general paradigm of the elastic interaction between colloidal particles in nlc is proposed so that every particle with strong anchoring and radius @xmath0 has three zones surrounding itself . </S>",
    "<S> the first zone for @xmath1 is the zone of topological defects ; the second zone at the approximate distance range @xmath2 is the zone where crossover from topological defects to the main multipole moment takes place . </S>",
    "<S> the higher order elastic terms are essential nere ( from 10% to 60% of the total deformation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the third zone is the zone of the main multipole moment , where higher order terms make a contribution of less than 10% . </S>",
    "<S> this zone extends to distances @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the case of spherical particles with planar anchoring conditions and boojums at the poles is considered as an example . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that boojums can be described analitically via multipole expansion with accuracy up to @xmath4 and the whole spherical particle can be effectively considered as the multipole of the order 6 with multipolarity equal @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the correspondent elastic interaction with higher order elastic terms gives the angle @xmath6 of minimum energy between two contact beads which is close to the experimental value of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , high order elastic terms make the effective power of the repulsive potential to be non - integer at the range @xmath8 for different distances . </S>",
    "<S> the incorporation of the high order elastic terms in the confined nlc produce results that agree with experimental data as well . </S>"
