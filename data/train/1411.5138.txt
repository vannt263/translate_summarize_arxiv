    "one of the key ingredients of spintronics is the possibility of manipulating the electronic flow via spin - charge coupling potentials @xcite .",
    "this goal can be achieved in semiconductor heterostructures lacking space inversion symmetry , as demonstrated by rashba @xcite .",
    "importantly , the strength of the rashba spin - orbit interaction can be externally tuned with a gate electrode electrostatically coupled to the heterostructure @xcite .",
    "thus , a spin field - effect transistor can be envisaged based on a narrow channel sandwiched between two ferromagnetic electrodes with independently controlled magnetizations @xcite .",
    "the electric field applied to the gate is then viewed as a momentum - dependent effective magnetic field acting on the channel , causing a modulated precession of the injected spins , which are transmitted into the drain electrode , provided their spin direction matches the drain magnetization .",
    "this device works in the ballistic regime and in the single - mode limit , in which case the precession angle is independent of energy .",
    "recent experiments report signatures of rashba spin - orbit modulated conductance in spin valve systems  @xcite measured in the nonlocal configuration @xcite .",
    "an important difference with the original proposal is that the transistor channel indeed supports multiple modes . as a consequence ,",
    "conductance oscillations disappear as the spin - orbit coupling increases , a result which is consistent with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the mechanism behind this amplitude decrease is the rashba intersubband coupling term that mixes adjacent subbands with opposite spin directions @xcite .",
    "this term can not be neglected in quantum wires and is responsible for a variety of phenomena : fano - rashba antiresonances @xcite , removal of magnetic - field - induced anomalous conductance steps @xcite , spin texturing @xcite , and spin relaxation @xcite .    in the limit of wide channels ,",
    "the spectrum of the transversal modes becomes continuous and the rashba precession and mixing terms must be treated on equal footing .",
    "reference @xcite shows that conductance oscillations persist , although they now originate from quantum interference between majority spin propagating states and minority spin quasibound states .",
    "these two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) offer the advantage of exhibiting transistor features in nonballistic devices @xcite or even without the presence of magnetic contacts @xcite .",
    "quite recently , there is a renewed interest in the physics and applications of 2des due to their bandgap tunability and reduced dimensions @xcite .",
    "spintronic devices are attractive systems because they offer new functionalities and less dissipation @xcite . however ,",
    "in contrast to the intense efforts in understanding the electric properties of spin transistors , much less is known about their response to a temperature difference ( thermoelectric or seebeck effect ) .",
    "the subject is interesting in view of recent experiments that verify the generation of spin currents when a thermal gradient is applied .",
    "this spin seebeck effect has thus far been revealed in magnetic alloys @xcite , ferromagnetic semiconductors @xcite , and even nonmagnetic materials @xcite . in a broad sense ,",
    "spin caloritronics is the study of spintronic effects created in thermally biased samples @xcite .",
    "spin biases due to temperature driven electron flow can be detected by means of the inverse spin hall effect @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a magneto - seebeck effect has also attracted a good deal of attention recently @xcite . here , the focus is not put on the creation of spin - polarized currents but rather on the dramatic changes seen in the junction thermopower when the orientation of the ferromagnetic electrodes is switched from the parallel to the antiparallel configuration .",
    "finally , recent measurements of the charge thermopower in 2des setups may indicate the presence of electronic correlations @xcite or diffusive transport mechanisms @xcite .",
    "our aim in this work is to examine the three seebeck effects ( charge , spin and magneto ) in a 2des spin transistor .",
    "we consider a quantum well laterally coupled to two ferromagnetic reservoirs kept at different temperatures @xmath0 , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] .",
    "thermocurrent - induced spin polarization effects in rashba 2des are discussed in refs .  @xcite using semiclassical approaches .",
    "here , we consider the quantum ( ballistic ) regime of transport and formulate a theoretical model based on the scattering approach .",
    "we observe clear oscillations in the charge seebeck coefficient when the rashba strength is varied even when the 2des is coupled to nonmagnetic reservoirs .",
    "importantly , in this case the transmission for up spins and down spins are equal and hence the spin seebeck coefficient is identically zero .",
    "this result agrees with ref .",
    "@xcite , which finds an absence of thermospin effects in spin - orbit coupled 2des .",
    "however , we below show that spin imbalances can be created in response to temperature differences when the electrodes are ferromagnetic .",
    "the effect is more prominent for larger rashba splittings .",
    "remarkably , the seebeck coefficient shows sign changes as a function of the fermi energy for the case of magnetic leads .",
    "this is one of the main findings of our work , as it suggests the possibility of controlling the thermoelectric current direction by varying the fermi energy with a nearby gate .",
    "furthermore , the thermopower depends on the relative orientation of the leads magnetization . since the spin - orbit field randomizes the spin direction of current - carrying states",
    ", one would expect a quench of the magneto - seebeck ratio when rashba interaction is turned on .",
    "however , we find significant changes in the presence of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the length of the central region where the rashba coupling is constant is @xmath1 ( gray area ) . then , @xmath2 decays smoothly to vanish in the contacts ( colored areas ) .",

    "the rashba coupling is spatially varying along the @xmath5-direction , which we take as the transport direction .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the conduction - band effective mass of the electrons in 2deg and @xmath8 is the rashba spin - orbit interaction depending on the pauli matrices @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 in eq .",
    "the rashba strength @xmath12 takes a constant value in each of the three regions of our system . in the left and the right contacts",
    "@xmath12 is equal to zero while in the central region , of width @xmath1 , @xmath12 takes a uniform value @xmath13 . in our numerical simulations ,",
    "the variation of this parameter at the interfaces is almost abrupt with a minor numerical smoothing , see appendix  [ app : f ] .",
    "the eigenfunctions in the leads are plane waves since the reservoirs are assumed metallic with good screening properties . in those asymptotic regions",
    "the band structure takes the general form @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the wave numbers along @xmath5 ( longitudinal ) and @xmath17 ( transverse ) directions , respectively .",
    "the @xmath16 momentum is constant throughout the system since the hamiltonian of eq .   remains invariant after translation along @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the wave function in the central region can be written in terms of the product of a plane wave in @xmath17-direction and an @xmath5-dependent amplitude @xmath18 for each channel labeled with @xmath19 .",
    "if we sum over spins @xmath20 and over all the transverse momenta the total wave function reads @xmath21 where @xmath20 is a spin index that characterizes the spin function @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the usual basis of the pauli matrices .    to determine the channel amplitude equations we project the schrdinger equation @xmath24 on a particular channel @xmath19 , @xmath25 these channel equations show coupling between different spins due to the spin - orbit interaction ( the terms @xmath26 ) .",
    "however , channels with different @xmath16 remain uncoupled due to the translational invariance along @xmath17-direction .",
    "this a unique feature of 2des devices since in quantum wires the coupled channel method does connect adjacent modes with opposite spins @xcite .    in the contacts",

    "this supports the suggestion that the charge thermopower can be controlled by changing the relative magnetization orientation . while the experiment reports sign changes of @xmath191 as a function of the base temperature @xcite , we here predict a similar effect by tuning the fermi energy of the 2des device .",
    "we have discussed the quantum thermoelectric properties of a two - dimensional electron system with nonhomogeneous spin - orbit interaction . when the device is attached to normal electrodes , we find that the thermopower is strongly modulated by either the spin - orbit strength or the channel length at fixed fermi energy . in the case of ferromagnetic leads ,",

    "<S> we consider a spin - orbit - coupled two - dimensional electron system under the influence of a thermal gradient externally applied to two attached reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the generated voltage bias ( charge seebeck effect ) , spin bias ( spin seebeck effect ) and magnetization - dependent thermopower ( magneto - seebeck effect ) in the ballistic regime of transport at linear response . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the charge thermopower is an oscillating function of both the spin - orbit strength and the quantum well width . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that it is always negative for normal leads . </S>",
    "<S> we carefully compare the exact results for the linear response coefficients and a sommerfeld approximation . </S>",
    "<S> when the contacts are ferromagnetic , we calculate the spin - resolved seebeck coefficient for parallel and antiparallel magnetization configuration . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the thermopower can change its sign by tuning the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> this effect disappears when the rashba coupling is absent . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we determine the magneto - seebeck ratio , which shows dramatic changes in the presence of a the rashba potential . </S>"
