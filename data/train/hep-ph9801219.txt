    "the experimental observations of the violation of kno scaling @xcite at the high energy @xmath8- and @xmath9-collisions @xcite and of the correlations between the average transverse momentum @xmath10 and the multiplicity @xmath11 of the secondaries ( a higher @xmath10 for high multiplicity events ) @xcite indicate that there are at least two ( complementary ) mechanisms of the high energy multiparticle production revealing the quark - gluon structure of hadrons and their interactions .    that kno scaling should be violated at very high energies was realized long ago @xcite , in the same year when kno scaling was introduced .",
    "this deviation from a kno type distribution of secondaries was attributed to the possibility of the splitting of each of the colliding hadrons into several constituents ( valence quarks , partons ) pair wise interacting with their counterparts from oppositely moving hadrons .",
    "the above picture results in the production of several showers and , in the frame of the reggeism , is attributed to the contribution of regge cuts to the elastic scattering amplitude , in addition to the regge pole ( pomeron ) corresponding to the production of the single shower .",
    "inclusion of such contributions changes the structure of the distribution @xmath12 @xmath13 is the cross section of the production of @xmath11 secondary hadrons ) at large @xmath14 ( @xmath15 = 1 gev@xmath16 ) leading to the appearance of the additional peaks in the distribution with larger @xmath17 ( here @xmath18 denotes the number of pairs of the simultaneously colliding partons involved in the interaction from the different hadrons , or the number of resulting showers ; @xmath19 , a single interaction , can be attributed to the regge pole ; @xmath20 , a double collision of two pairs of partons from different hadrons , can be attributed to the exchange of two pomerons ( regge cut ) , etc . ) .",
    "in this picture , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mean multiplicity corresponding to the production of one shower in the single partonic collision .",
    "we have , from the data where the one pomeron exchange describes experiments at lower energies @xmath23 , with @xmath24 ; @xmath25 ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "this qualitative picture @xcite corresponds to the idealized scenario where only `` non - enhanced '' regge - type diagrams are included ( `` quasi - eikonal '' approximation ) .",
    "inclusion of the so - called `` enhanced '' diagrams where the possibility of the branching of ladders - showers is allowed , thus giving the emission of the smaller average number of emitted particles than the corresponding non - enhanced cut , leads to the smearing out of the distribution between the peaks reducing the effects of kno violations .",
    "since the distributions of particles in the different ladders are independent , one expects that @xmath26 giving the broadening of the distribution @xmath12 .",
    "gev ) kno scaling ( in the whole rapidity interval ) is violated strongly , this indicates that at these energies the `` enhanced '' graphs , probably , are not important .",
    "it is not excluded , that at higher energies kno scaling will be restored . ]",
    "we emphasize that the multipomeron exchanges are especially important in the modern treatment of the pomeron as a pole with intercept @xmath27 higher than unity @xmath28 ; for `` soft '' pomeron @xmath29 as experimental data on high energy `` soft '' collisions show ) , where the relative role of these exchanges is increased with energy @xcite ( e.g. , pomeron contribution to the @xmath30 is @xmath31 , whereas the @xmath18 pomeron exchange is @xmath32 ) .",
    "concerning the effective number of exchanges in `` quasi - eikonal '' approximation , one has @xmath33",
    "@xcite for @xmath34 tev @xmath35 .",
    "thus , from this point of view , only double parton interactions ( two effective pomeron exchanges ) in addition to the single collision are expected to be effective at the energies up to the tevatron energy . at lhc energy ( @xmath36 tev )",
    "this parameter @xmath37 , thus indicating the possibility of the appearance of the third maximum in @xmath38 distribution with @xmath39 ( see fig . 1 and appendix b ) .",
    "on the qcd level , the ultra - high energy interaction between hadrons phenomenologically described by pomeron exchange is treated as a result of a ( few ) gluons exchange between the constituents of hadrons as they pass close to one another @xcite . after a color exchange between partons ( valence quarks , gluons , etc . )",
    "carried by the colliding hadrons , partons from one hadron are joined by two gluon strings with partons inside the other hadron .",
    "this pair of strings stretch when hadrons separate after the collision and break down transforming into the system of hadrons forming a pomeron - like shower ( ladder ) , giving the asymptotic density of hadrons .    from this point ,",
    "the above described @xmath18 pomeron exchanges are considered as the joining and stretching of @xmath18 different pairs of strings between hadron constituents resulting , after the hadron separation , the production of @xmath18 pomeron - like showers with @xmath18-fold increased average multiplicity @xmath40 .",
    "this picture using the language of gluon strings can be related to the pomeron phenomenology , at least in the quasi - eikonal approximation , and , as shown in @xcite , leads to the same expressions for a variety of characteristics of the high energy strong interactions as the regge diagram technique , giving also the possibility to determine some free parameters of last one .",
    "from the more phenomenological approach @xcite , it is possible to argue that there are at least two components in the cross sections for the ultra - fast hadron collisions : soft component corresponding to the single collisions of partons from different hadrons which can ( but not necessarily ) be described by the exchange of the single pomeron ( or the pair of gluonic strings ) , and the so - called semi - hard ( jet ) component which is responsible for the higher @xmath6 of the secondaries than is usually attributed to the single `` soft '' pomeron exchange .    at low energies ( up to energy of isr ) only soft interactions with scaled multiplicity distribution of the kno type are important . at higher energies ( cern sps , tevatron ) the kno - like shape of the multiplicity distribution",
    "is modified by the increasing role of the `` hard '' multiparton interactions @xcite ( four parton collisions of @xcite ) that leads to the increase of the fraction of events with higher multiplicity @xmath41 .",
    "this new channel is characterized , at the same time , by the higher @xmath42 , in accordance with the experimental observation @xcite that the high multiplicity events indicate a jet - like structure .    from the point of view of the interactions between constituents",
    ", one can argue that this second `` semihard '' component with @xmath43 is due to the double collisions when in the same inelastic interaction , two different parton pairs from colliding hadrons independently collide . since the parton densities of the colliding hadrons overlap strongly at small impact parameters ( higher @xmath44 ) the probability of the double parton collision @xmath35 is enhanced , and , as a result , two pairs of soft partons ( e.g. , valence quarks ) @xmath45 ) stacked in the collision resulting in the ( mini ) jet structure of the secondaries with @xmath46 .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the above two - component model gives a successful fit for the total non - single diffractive inelastic cross section inclusive spectra and multiplicity distribution in full phase space for the energies @xmath47 and 546 gev .",
    "we note that in @xcite the ad hoc assumption was made that the inelastic cross section for the soft component ( single parton collisions ) is energy independent .",
    "we will see below , from our analysis of the multiplicity distribution , that the high energy inelastic cross section corresponding to the single parton collisions indeed , practically does not depend on @xmath4 , as it was assumed in @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the one pomeron exchange in its quasi - eikonal form gives an increase of inelastic cross section .",
    "we do nt know the answer to that inconsistency , except that the role of the enhanced diagrams is underestimated , and they have to be included in the analysis of the `` soft '' cross section .",
    "now , if we again turn to the language of the pomeron exchanges , it is possible to conjecture that the above described double parton collisions can be attributed to the double effective pomeron exchange which leads not only to the higher multiplicity ( and to the deviation from kno shape ) but also to the increase of the average transverse momentum @xmath10 in the regime of @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath44 dependence of @xmath18 pomeron exchange amplitude is given by the expression exp @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "experimentally , for @xmath51-collisions , @xmath52 gev@xmath53 @xcite .",
    "that gives for the ratio @xmath54 this ratio is in good correspondence to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the further increase of the @xmath10 can be expected at the effective opening of the triple parton collision , which as we see from fig .",
    "1 should be clearly displayed at the lhc energy range .",
    "an experimentally established increase of @xmath10 with energy is connected , of course , with the gradual increase of the relative role of the double pomeron exchange ( or double parton collisions ) with energy .",
    "there are recent results from the cdf collaboration @xcite for the process ",
    "independent and free from theoretical schemes cross section of double parton collision in the 3 jets data : @xmath55 the afs experiment @xcite ( @xmath56 gev ) gives for the same quantity @xmath57 5 mb , while ua2 presents a lower limit of @xmath58 mb @xcite .",
    "here we analyze the data on the multiplicity distributions obtained at the energy range @xmath4 from 30 to 1800 gev including isr , ua5 and tevatron ( e735 experiment ) data .",
    "we use as a basis of our analysis the fact that kno scaling is well satisfied in the experimental data through the isr energies .",
    "the deviation from the simple kno scaling at higher energies is due to another process which is incoherently superimposed on the kno producing process . in fig .",
    "3 , the differential cross sections are displayed for the ua5 and the e735 data .",
    "note that the e735 data is likely to be less reliable at low multiplicities than the ua5 data whereas the e735 data is more statistically reliable at the higher multiplicities .    in fig .",
    "3 the collider data from different energies is superimposed on one plot .",
    "the data have been normalized to the same value of the variable @xmath59 at the @xmath60 , maximum value @xmath61 .",
    "it turns out that the cross section at the maximum is essentially independent of energy . from the measurement of kno curve at the isr energies",
    "we know that @xmath62 .",
    "thus , we can estimate the value of @xmath22 , the average multiplicity for the processes with pure kno scaling from the known value of @xmath63 at which the cross section is a maximum for higher energies .",
    "we made a least square fits to the value of @xmath63 and @xmath22 over range @xmath4 from 30 gev to 1800 gev for the former and @xmath4 from 30 gev to 200 gev ( where kno scaling is well satisfied ) for the latter .",
    "these two quantities are well fitted by the form @xmath64 with the same coefficients over their regions of overlap . as we remarked above , the deviation from kno",
    "scaling is due to another process which is incoherently superimposed on top of the kno producing process . by subtracting the kno distribution from the observed data we determine the shape of the competing process as shown in fig .",
    "the shapes of the multiplicity distribution thus found are rather different from the kno distrubition and is not a simple convolution of the kno distribution .",
    "there must be a correlation between the multiplicities in the two collisions .",
    "the main characteristics of the derived distribution is that the most probable value of the distribution occurs at @xmath65 ( or at twice the multiplicity corresponding to the initial low energy kno distribution ) .",
    "the width of the distribution is close to @xmath66 times the width of that kno shape .",
    "this is in quite good agreement with the picture we presented above , which is based on the adding of the double collision of partons of the colliding hadrons by the exchange of the two pomerons ( or two pairs of strings ) to the single parton collision which proceeds by the exchange of one _ effective _ pomeron .",
    "anyway , independently of the concrete realization of the interaction between ultrarelativistic parton pairs , we can interpret the population of the secondaries with maximum at @xmath67 as a result of two independent parton - parton collisions occuring in the same encounter .",
    "we denote the inelastic ( non - single diffractive ) cross section for this process by @xmath68 whereas @xmath2 denoted the inelastic cross section due to the single parton - parton collision .",
    "this @xmath2 is characterized by the kno scaling and , as it follows from our analysis , it is nearly energy independent for @xmath69 gev and has a value of @xmath70 mb ( fig .",
    "some remarks on the experimental data of e735 and ua5 are necessary . in figs .",
    "3 - 5 we do not show error bars on all the points in the derived distributions .",
    "the statistical errors in e735 are relatively small",
    ". however , the systematic error in both experiments might be sizeable . in e735 as well as ua5 the multiplicities in a restricted range of rapidity are extended to the full range by computer simulation .",
    "there are corrections for secondary interactions in individual events .",
    "the derived distributions in fig .",
    "3 suffer in accuracy from the fact that one uses subtraction of two different distributions which each have uncertainties . when the experimental data and the kno distribution are close in value then the error is greater .",
    "fortunately , the kno distribution is only the order of 10% of the experimental data at @xmath71 and consequently , the position of the peak in the derived distribution is not strongly affected by errors produced by taking the differences .",
    "the whole distribution might move up and down as a result of errors in either of the kno or experimental distrubitions .",
    "the values of the cross sections represented by the curves shown in figs .",
    "3,4 are given in fig .",
    "it is seen there that , in contrast of @xmath72 is increased with @xmath4 and equals 16 mb at 1800 gev .",
    "we already have mentioned that cdf collaboration gives the effective double - parton collision cross section equal ( @xmath73 mb .",
    "one has to realize that in the sample of events with double parton collisions cdf has removed events with possible triple collisions .",
    "we can conclude that the double ( and possibly , triple ) collisions account for a large fraction of the increase in the total @xmath74-cross section and , definitely , are responsible for the increase of the @xmath51 inelastic cross section .    as the collision energies are increased to lhc values",
    ", it seems likely that double and possibly triple collisions will constitute a larger fraction of the inelastic cross section as is seen in our effective analyses from the previous sections ( see fig .",
    "another indication of the increasing importance of double collisions comes from an examination of the @xmath10 of the charged particles at high multiplicity events . as we mentioned above",
    "there is an increase of @xmath10 as multiplicity increases .",
    "we note that @xmath10 increases by close to a factor @xmath66 from low to high multiplicity .",
    "the picture with the effective double pomeron exchange in the double - parton collision leads just to this @xmath66 extra factor .",
    "the increse of the fraction of the multi - collisions with energy will , in general , lead to this well known @xmath10-multiplicity relation .",
    "we expect that at lhc energies @xmath10 will undergo the additional increase .",
    "in this paper we have attempted to isolate and study the double - parton collision mechanism from the analysis of high energy multiplicity data .",
    "the main result of our analysis of these data is that the non - single diffractive inelastic cross section consists of two components .",
    "the first component corresponding to the single parton collisions is characterized by being practically independent of @xmath4 cross section for @xmath75 gev , whereas the second part of the @xmath76 increases significally with energy and achieves the value 16 mb at @xmath77 tev . that part was attributed here to the inclusion in the collision process of the double ( and , maybe , triple ) parton collisions .",
    "thus , the increase of the @xmath76 at high @xmath4 is almost entirely due to the multi - parton collisions .    on the other hand , we know from the experiment at lower energies where the single parton collisions indeed dominate that @xmath76 is increasing with @xmath4",
    "this indicates that at higher energies @xmath75 gev the inelastic cross section due to the single collision goes to the saturation , whereas the double collisions give the increasing part of the @xmath76 .",
    "one can go further and conjecture that the same saturation will occur for the part of @xmath78 connected with the double parton collisions at much higher energies whereas the @xmath78 due to the triple collisions will still increase with @xmath4 , etc .",
    ", until asymptotically the total inelastic cross section ( without the diffractive part ) will set a constant value @xmath79 .",
    "of course , we can not say anything about the behavior of @xmath80 and @xmath81 at this hypothetical limit .",
    "we need to emphasize that in this paper we have often used the notion of the `` soft '' pomeron exchange in the process of parton collisions . of course",
    ", this notion should be understood as an effective tool of the description of the ultrarelativistic parton collision and have played only the illustrative role and the trend in our analysis . however , the picture of the multi - parton collisions described here and the corresponding values for @xmath2 and @xmath3 extracted from our above analysis of the multiplicity are independent of the concrete mechanism of the parton - parton interaction .",
