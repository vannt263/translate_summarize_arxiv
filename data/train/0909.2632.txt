    "variations in @xmath4  are probably responsible for the spectral and variability states of black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ; @xcite ) .",
    "transient bhxbs spend long periods at very low x - ray luminosities , referred to as ` quiescence ' , but during occasional outbursts the luminosity increases by as much as 7 to 8 orders of magnitude , typically reaching values of tens of per cent of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "has shown that below around a few percent of @xmath5  bhxbs typically return to the so  called hard state , in which the spectrum is dominated by a power law component with an index @xmath61.5 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "about 15 bhxbs have been observed in quiescence with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , but only in a handful of cases could the spectral properties be well constrained . nevertheless , these few cases suggest an interesting property of quiescent spectra : when fitted with a power - law the indices tend to be considerably softer than the index of @xmath12 found in the hard state ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "although the errors for individual sources are still large , the overall trend seems to indicate that , at least spectrally , the quiescent state is different from the hard state that is observed three to five decades higher in @xmath8 .",
    "corbel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and @xcite have demonstrated the existence of a relation between observed x - ray and radio emission from hard state black holes , of the form @xmath13 ; this relation is nearly the same for v404  cyg and gx  3394 .",

    "_ chandra _ and vla observations of a  062000 in quiescence by @xcite showed that the radio and x  ray flux lie on the extension of the @xmath16 correlation , suggesting that it holds all the way down to quiescence .",

    "after the transition to the low  hard state the spectral index is consistent with being 0 . to obtain a more accurate measurement of the radio spectral index ,",

    "the 4.868.46 ghz radio spectral index for these averages is 0.03@xmath20.18 .",
    "this is consistent with optically thick emission as has been observed in low ",

    "this data coincides with the radio flare observable at 8.46 ghz .",
    "combining the three 1.4 ghz observations does provide a detection at 0.431@xmath20.097 mjy . at 8.46 ghz",
    "the average flux is 0.175@xmath20.028 mjy .",
    "the 1.48.46 ghz radio spectral index is -0.50@xmath20.15 .",
    "this implies optically thin radio emission late in the low  hard state .",
    "in figure  [ rxcorr ] we plot the observed correlation between the x  ray and 8.46 ghz radio fluxes for  using the x  ray observations closest in time to the radio observations ( see footnotes to the journals of the x  ray observations and table  [ vla - log ] ) . the best  fitting power law with index 0.18@xmath20.01 ( 1 @xmath24 ) is overplotted .",
    "the index is less steep than the index of @xmath250.7 as found for several sources before ( s@xmath26@xcite ; ) .",
    "there are several effects that could distort the picture .",
    "first , the radio and x  ray data are not strictly simultaneous ( see table  [ vla - log ] ) .",
    "there is typically less than 1 day between the start of the radio and x  ray observations , however , in one case the difference in start times is as much as 1.5 days .",
    "this together with the flares apparent in the radio light curve as well as in the _ rxte _ and  x  ray observations could result in a higher flux in either radio or x  ray which might confuse the apparent correlation .",
    "short duration radio flares have been found in e.g.  v404  cyg ( @xcite ) .",
    "last , since the spatial resolution of our vla observations is several arcseconds , the observed radio flux might include emission from a ballistic jet ",
    "ejection event earlier in the outburst .",
    "although the atca non  detection shows that the initial radio emission probably related to jet  ejection events occurring before the transition to the low ",
    "hard state faded away , shocks further down the flow can lead to rebrightenings in radio ( and x  ray ) at a later stage .",
    "the fact that the radio spectral index during the epoch related to the radio flare at mjd  54520 is showing that the radio emission is optically thin strongly argues in favour of this scenario .",
    "given the low spatial resolution of our radio observations this emission can significantly contribute to the radio flux density during the subsequent measurements .",
    "xte  j1550564 dramatically demonstrates this , with radio ( and x  ray ) emission from the state transition ejecta still brightening years after the outburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "the part of the radio decay of that our observations sample with detections lasts about 33 days . in the most extreme case of a jet / flow speed of c , in 33 days a distance of 0.028 pc",
    "can be travelled . at a source distance of 7.5 kpc",
    "this corresponds to 078 for a jet in the plane of the sky .",
    "such an angular extent would still be unresolved by the vla in the cnb and certainly c configuration .",
    "this indicates that similar to the case of xte  j1550564 , shocks in the jet flow could indeed be responsible for the enhanced radio emission .",
    "since such an angular extend could potentially be detected by  we averaged the four observations obtained after march 20 , 2008 .",
    "we registered the four observations to a common astrometric frame using the position of the brightest x  ray source ( besides ) detected in the observations . after merging the registered frames",
    ", we determined the position of the x  ray source associated with  in the same way as described above .",
    "we find that the position of  in the average of the last 4 observations in 2008 is consistent with the best known radio position found by @xcite , therefore , the shocked radio emission is either not responsible for x  ray emission or it has travelled significantly less than the 078 calculated above .    in order for radio emission from shocks",
    "downstream to be the cause of the flattening of the index of the radio  x  ray correlation , the radio emission should not be accompanied by a similar amount of x  ray emission as during the processes responsible for the index of @xmath00.7 during the normal low ",
    "hard state decay .    in order to compare the normalisation of this correlation",
    "with that found in other sources we need to know the distance of  ( see @xcite ) . as mentioned in the introduction we use a distance of 7.5 kpc for . comparing the normalisation of the radio",
    " x  ray correlation for a distance of 7.5 kpc with that of other sources we find that  lies above the area traced out by gx  3394 and v  404 cyg ( @xcite ) . even lowering the distance by a factor 2 one still finds the source above gx  3394 and v  404 cyg .",
    "finally , our fluxes and luminosities are given in the 0.5 - 10 kev band whereas the correlation was plotted in the 211 kev band by @xcite .",
    "the influence of the different energy bands on the slope of the radio  x  ray correlation is minimal since the x  ray spectrum does not change significantly during the decay .",
    "the normalisation is influenced by the difference in energy bands , though .",
    "for comparison we also computed the 211 kev x ",
    "ray fluxes of our x  ray observations and we find that the 211 kev values are 80@xmath25 per cent of the values at 0.510 kev .",
    "thus , our 0.510 kev luminosities are slightly higher than the 211 kev luminosities bringing  artificially closer to the area traced by gx  3394 and v  404 cyg .",
    "the difference in normalisation would be larger if we had used the exact same energy range .",
    "using ,  and _ rxte _ x  ray observations with ( near)simultaneous radio vla observations we have observed the decay towards quiescence of the black hole candidate x  ray binary while the source was in the low  hard state",
    ". the overall shape of the x  ray decay light curve can be described with an exponential with an e  folding timescale of @xmath04 days that levels off towards quiescence .",
    "ray flares are superposed on the exponential decay light curve . during several of the  observations flares",
    "were observed as well . the unabsorbed 0.510 kev quiescent flux is 4.3@xmath27 . for an assumed source distance of 7.5 kpc",
    "this implies a quiescent 0.5 - 10 kev x ",
    "ray luminosity of @xmath28 .",
    "the source luminosity in quiescence after the outburst ending early 2008 is consistent with being the same as that after the 2004 outburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "the quiescent x  ray luminosity of @xmath29  of implies an orbital period longward of @xmath010 hours assuming follows the general trend between orbital period and quiescent x  ray luminosity reported in @xcite .",
    "such an orbital period suggests that the mass donor star in  has evolved off the main sequence .",
    "alternatively , the mass of the black hole in could be substantially larger than that in the sources defining the relation between orbital period and quiescent x  ray luminosity .    the low ",
    "hard state radio light curve shows evidence for radio flares superposed on an exponential decay with an e  folding timescale of @xmath30 days .",
    "when plotted against the x  ray light curve the radio  x  ray correlation index is lower ( @xmath31 ) than found before ( @xmath32 ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "the radio flares could be responsible for extended jet emission that due to the relatively large vla beamsize in our observations using c and cnb configurations was not resolved .",
    "the 1.48.46 ghz radio spectral index during the mjd  54520 flare is -0.50@xmath20.15 indicating that the radio emission is probably optically thin .",
    "relativistic arcsecond scale jets have not been found before for sources in the low  hard state ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it seems more likely that jet ejections earlier in the outburst of  caused shocks when travelling along the jet .",
    "we note that similar events could be behind the apparent scatter and variability in the observed radio  x  ray correlation in other sources ( cf .",
    "the resulting index then depends on the amount and energy in the shocks caused by earlier ejection events .",
    "these will change from source to source and from outburst to outburst .",
    "for instance , plotting the radio and x  ray detections in the low  hard state during the decay @xcite we find that two of the three 2003 data points fall approximately a factor 2 to 3 below the curve in figure  [ rxcorr ] .",
    "increases in the radio flux density in the low  hard state by factors of 310 have been observed in the short  timescale radio flares in the quiescent state of v  404 cyg ( @xcite ) .",
    "given that the radio and x  ray data that we presented here are not exactly simultaneous , any hour  long radio flare would have no corresponding flare in the x  ray band .",
    "furthermore , even if the observations had been strictly simultaneous , the short integration times of our initial radio observations implies that an x  ray flare could have been missed since such an x  ray flare would take tens of minutes or longer to propagate downstream to the point in the compact jet where the optical depth is @xmath01 at 8.46  ghz .",
    "nevertheless , in order to produce a slope of @xmath33 the radio observations must have been close to the peak of flares , which seems unlikely .",
    "we conclude that optically thin radio emission from shocks caused by jet ejections earlier in the outburst influence the late time low  hard state radio emission .",
    "previous studies of black hole ( candidate ) sources decaying via the hard state to quiescence suggests that the power  law index of the x  ray spectrum in the quiescent state is different from that in the low  hard state .",
    "@xcite observed gs  112468 with _",
    "ginga _ and found a power - law index that remained essentially constant at @xmath61.6 during the time the source was decaying in the hard state , except at the lowest observed luminosity of @xmath34@xmath5  ( for @xmath35=7@xmath11 ) when it was found to be 1.84@xmath20.04 .",
    "have reported a power - law spectral index of @xmath62.2 around @xmath36@xmath5  for gx  3394 ( for @xmath35=5.8@xmath11 ) .",
    "@xcite followed xte  j1650500 down to @xmath37@xmath5  ( for @xmath35=8.5@xmath11 ) with _ chandra _ , and also found evidence for spectral softening .",
    "finally , @xcite show that the power  law spectral index is softer in v404  cyg in quiescence compared to that in the brighter low  hard state .    in figure  [ plindex ]",
    "we have plotted the power law index from the  and  spectral modelling on  during the decay towards quiescence and in quiescence .",
    "the data point at the lowest x  ray flux is determined by combining the quiescent data obtained right after the outburst of early 2008 as well as the quiescence observations used by @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for a softening of the power ",
    "law index towards and in quiescence , although for this source the relatively high neutral hydrogen column density limits the accuracy of the power ",
    "law determination .",
    "a fit of a constant power ",
    "law spectral index gives a best  fitting index of 1.704@xmath20.008 with a @xmath38 for 9 degrees of freedom .",
    "we have compared the x  ray flux decay rate of  with that observed during the last part of the outburst decay from the black hole candidate xte  j1908 + 094 and we find that the fit function describing the decay of  is a good approximation to the last phase of approximately three weeks presented in jonker et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for xte  j1908 + 094 .",
