    "we have shown that the kitaev model with classical spins shows no order - by - disorder , while there are plausible arguments that the quantum model does .",
    "this is because the mechanism of order -by- disorder in classical and quantum models is somewhat different .",
    "consider a classical model , whose ground states form an m - dimensional manifold .",
    "let @xmath323 be one of the ground states .",
    "we expand the energy in the coordinates orthogonal to the manifold , and look for small perturbations about the ground state . keeping terms in the deviations from the ground state to quadratic order , and going into the normal mode",

    "however , the classical partition function corresponds to the case @xmath328 , and at low temperature @xmath2 is easily seen to be proportional to @xmath329 .",
    "thus the relative weights of different points @xmath323 on the manifold are determined by an effective free energy @xmath330 proportional to @xmath331 .",

    "the large-@xmath5 quantum kitaev model becomes a set of classical spins on a @xmath338 dimensional lattice , with kitaev couplings in two spatial directions , and ferromagnetic couplings in the time / inverse - temperature direction .",
    "it is quite plausible that in this @xmath339-dimensional model , there is long - range order for low  effective temperature \" , but in the @xmath340-dimensional classical kitaev model , the destablizing effect of fluctuations is too strong .",
    "there are several interesting classical 2d systems , where thermal order - by - disorder is expected .",
    "the prototypical example is the system of heisenberg spins on a kagome lattice , with nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic couplings .",
    "the expectation of order - by - disorder in this classical system comes from theoretical and monte - carlo studies , that suggest that at low temperatures , the spins lie on a single plane as @xmath341 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this model can also be related to the height model at its critical point , within the quadratic approximation , suggesting that a single long - range ordered state ( the @xmath342 state ) is selected over the coplanar ones @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to identify the main reason for the difference in the behaviors in these models and the case studied here .",
    "we have mapped the finite and zero temperature problem of classical spins onto a height - model interacting via an effective hamiltonian @xmath168 .",
    "this effective hamiltonian depends on the temperature of the spin model .",
    "we have shown that the correlations of the height variables vary as @xmath244 , where @xmath218 is the distance between the sites , for all temperatures of the spin model .",
