    "<S> the probability distribution of a neutral pion fraction from independent domains of disoriented chiral condensate is characterized . </S>",
    "<S> the signal for the condensate is still clear for a large number of independent domains if one of them is predominant .    a disoriented dhiral condensate ( dcc ) </S>",
    "<S> may be formed in large hot regions of hadronic matter where the approximate chiral symmetry of qcd has been briefly restored . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of this region induces a non - equilibrium relaxation of the chiral fields which is predicted to create coherent sources of soft pion modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the charge of the pions emitted from the dcc has a characteristic probability distribution@xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the number of observed neutral pions while @xmath3 is the total number of observed pions . </S>",
    "<S> this is markedly different from the standard statistical distribution which , for large @xmath3 , we expect to be @xmath4 using the discrete wavelet transformation method , huang et al.@xcite calculated the probability distribution of the neutral pion fraction @xmath5 for different physical scales and found that due to the dcc cluster size , @xmath6 exhibits a delay in approaching eq.(3 ) required by the central limit theorem ( _ delayed central limit _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can be used as a signature of dcc in high energy heavy - ion collisions .    recently </S>",
    "<S> amado and lu@xcite claimed that for more than three independent domains of dcc the signal for condensate ( eq.(1 ) ) will be reduced . </S>",
    "<S> but their conclusion is based on the assumption that the @xmath7 independent regions have equal weight which means that each region emits the same total number of pions . in the case </S>",
    "<S> that the number of the regions goes to infinity , the probability distribution of the neutral pion fraction becomes @xmath8 . in this brief report </S>",
    "<S> , we will prove that if one of these regions is predominant , that is , if most pions are emitted from one of the uncorrelated domains , we can still have a clear signal for the condensate even though the number of the independent regions is very large . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that , particularly in a heavy ion collisions , more than one domain or region of chiral condensate will be formed in the large interaction volume@xcite . similar to ref.@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we assume that these domains are uncorrelated , that is , pions are emitted independently from each domain . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the observed neutral pion fraction @xmath5 will be an average over these independent regions . </S>",
    "<S> it is also likely that each region has a different weight @xmath9 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 is the total number of pions emitted from region @xmath11 . in each single region </S>",
    "<S> we take the probability of @xmath5 to be given by @xmath12 ( eq.(1 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> then the probability of finding a neutral fraction @xmath5 averaged over the n regions is given by @xmath13 this can be transformed into a recursion relation , @xmath14 this relation is particularly helpful in computing @xmath15 stepwise in n. for two domains the probability can be found analytically and we get @xmath16 for @xmath17 , @xmath18\\ ] ] for @xmath19 and @xmath20\\ ] ] for @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> for the case @xmath22 the result was previously calculated in @xcite . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that for @xmath23 , as @xmath24 tends to infinity , the probability distribution reaches exactly eq.(3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is easily checked that eq.(4 ) can be written down as    @xmath25    using the relationship that @xmath26 we have @xmath27 now we consider the non equal - weight case and for simplicity we assume that @xmath28 , that is , eighty percent of the pions are emitted from one of those independent domains , the other pions are emitted by other regions with weight @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results are shown in fig.1 . for @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath31 for @xmath32 @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath31 for @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this shows clearly the difference between our results and previous results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even with many independent regions of dcc , we can still have a clear signal of dcc if one of these regions is predominant .    </S>",
    "<S> conclusion : in this brief report , we calculated the probability distribution of @xmath6 for more than three independent domains with different weights . it was shown that if one of this dcc regions is predominant , we can still see the signal of the condensate even if the number of domains is very large .    </S>",
