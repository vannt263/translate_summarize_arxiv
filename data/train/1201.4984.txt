    "the phenomenon of pinning the magnetization direction of a thin - film ferromagnet due to coupling with an adjacent thin - film antiferromagent(af ) is key to spin - valve based magnetic transducer technology.@xcite understanding exchange bias at the microscopic level has progressed substantially in recent years and suggests that a mechanism to stabilize domains in the surface layers of the af is essential.@xcite nearly degenerate energy states of the surface spin structure , such as found in geometrically frustrated afs , can facilitate such domain formation.@xcite although there are many features of the ir - mn compounds , such as high nel temperatures ( @xmath2 ) which have contributed to their being one of the most commonly used materials for the pinning layer in mass produced spin valves , it has been argued that the spin frustration realized in the parent fcc compound irmn@xmath1 is relevant.@xcite irmn@xmath1 is in a class of magnetic compounds having the cuau@xmath1 crystal structure which can be described as 2d triangular planes abc stacked along @xmath3 axes.@xcite however , it has not been previously noted that the magnetic mn ions reside on sites in these planes that form the kagom structure .",

    "the expected zero temperature limit of the specific heat , @xmath6 per spin , has been verified by monte carlo simulations.@xcite long range ground state nel order has been demonstrated by adding further - neighbor exchange interactions in the heisenberg case giving rise to so - called @xmath0 ( see fig .",

    "<S> monte carlo simulation results are reported on magnetic ordering in abc stacked kagom layers with fcc symmetry for both xy and heisenberg models which include exchange interactions with the eight near - neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> well known degeneracies of the 2d system persist in the 3d case and analysis of the numerical data provides strong evidence for a fluctuation - driven first - order transition to well - defined long - range order characterized as the layered @xmath0 ( 120-degree ) spin structure . </S>",
    "<S> effects of varying the inter - layer coupling are also examined . </S>",
    "<S> the results are relevant to understanding the role of frustration in irmn@xmath1 alloys widely used by the magnetic storage industry as thin - films in the antiferromagnetic pinning layer in gmr and tmr spin valves . despite the technological importance of this structure </S>",
    "<S> , it has not previously been noted that the magnetic mn - ions of fcc irmn@xmath1 form kagom layers . </S>"
