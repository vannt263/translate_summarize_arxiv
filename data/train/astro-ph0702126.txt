    "among the various issues that remain open in the field of accretion onto black hole binaries ( bhbs ) as well as super - massive black holes is the way the gas accretes at very low eddington ratios , in the so called _ quiescent _ regime ( where , for the binaries , the boundary between quiescence and a more active regime can be set around @xmath3 erg , corresponding to a few @xmath4for a 10  bh ; the reader is referred to mcclintock & remillard @xcite for a review of x - ray states ) . while there is little doubt that the thin disc model  @xcite captures the basic physical properties of bhbs in the thermal dominant state , the accretion mode responsible for powering quiescent bhs is still a matter of debate .",
    "observations of highly sub - eddington systems , most notably the galactic center super - massive bh , paved the way to radiatively inefficient accretion flow models ( riafs ) . by reviewing the vast literature on the subject , one immediately comes to the conclusion that the most widely accepted / adopted model for reproducing the spectral energy distribution of quiescent bhs is the ` advection - dominated accretion flow ' solution ( adaf  @xcite@xcite ) ; in this low - density , two temperature inflow , a significant fraction of the viscously dissipated energy remains locked up in the ions as heat , and is advected inward . the adaf model can successfully account for the overall shape of the uv - optical - x - ray spectra of quiescent bhbs ( see mcclintock 2003  @xcite for an application to the high quality data of xte j1118 + 480 ) .",
    "nevertheless , alternative suggestions are worth being considered . for instance , convection , rather than advection , could be responsible for keeping the plasma circulating in eddies along the flow by transporting angular momentum inward , yielding zero net accretion rate ( cdaf ;  @xcite ) .",
    "a different solution is that elaborated by blandford & begelman @xcite , where the excess energy and angular momentum is lost to an outflow at all radii ; the final accretion rate into the hole may be only a tiny fraction of the mass supply at large radii ( adios : ` adiabatic inflow - outflow solution ' ) .",
    "radiatively inefficient outflows may also be responsible for dissipating the bulk of the liberated accretion power ( e.g.  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the question remains open whether quiescent bhbs are dim because of a highly reduced radiative efficiency , or a highly reduced inner accretion rate .",
    "recent chandra observations of nearby elliptical galaxies  @xcite led to the discovery of a tight correlation between the bondi accretion rate , @xmath5 ( as inferred from the measured temperature , bh mass and density profile ) and the power emerging from these systems in the form of relativistic jets ( estimated by the work they exert on the observed x - ray cavities ) . the jets power is found to be comparable to @xmath6 , implying that a significant fraction of the matter entering the accretion radius flows down to regions close to the black holes , where the jets are thought to be formed .",
    "in the context of x - ray binaries , as well as super - massive black holes , the term ` jet ' is typically used as a synonymous for a relativistic outflow of plasma and implies a high degree of collimation ( see fender 2006  @xcite for a comprehensive review on x - ray binary jets ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", high spatial resolution radio observations of bhbs in the hard state @xcite have imaged highly collimated structures in two systems only : cyg x-1  @xcite and grs  1915 + 105  @xcite are both resolved into elongated radio sources on milliarcsec scales  that is tens of a.u .  implying collimation angles smaller than a few degrees on much larger scales than the orbital separation .",
    "both systems display relatively high x - ray ( and radio ) luminosities , with grs 1915 + 105 being persistently close to the eddington limit ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and cyg x-1 having a bolometric x - ray luminosity around 2 per cent of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "this , however , should not be taken as evidence against collimated jets at lower luminosities : because of sensitivity limitations on current high resolution radio arrays , resolving a radio jet at microjy level ( if any ) simply constitutes an observational challenge .",
    "in addition , at such low levels , the radio flux could be easily contaminated by synchrotron emission from the donor star .",
    "the presence of a collimated outflow can also be inferred by its long - term action on the local interstellar medium , as in the case of the hard state bhbs 1e1740.7@xmath82942 and grs  1758@xmath8258 , both associated with arcmin - scale radio lobes  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "further indications come from the stability in the orientation of the electric vector in the radio polarization maps of gx  339@xmath84 over a two year period  @xcite .",
    "this constant position angle , being the same as the sky position angle of the large - scale , optically thin radio jet powered by gx 339@xmath84 after its 2002 outburst  @xcite , clearly indicates a favoured ejection axis in the system .",
    "on the other hand , failure to image a collimated structure in the hard state of xte j1118 + 480 down to a synthesized beam of 0.6@xmath91.0 mas@xmath10 at 8.4 ghz  @xcite can challenge the collimated jet interpretation , even though xte j1118 + 408 was observed at roughly one order of magnitude lower luminosity with respect to e.g. cyg x-1 .",
    "if the jet size scaled as the radiated power , one could expect the jet of xte j1118 + 408 to be roughly ten times smaller than that of cyg x-1 ( which is 2@xmath96 mas@xmath10 at 9 ghz , at about the same distance ) , still point - like in the vlba maps presented by mirabel 2001  @xcite .",
    "garcia 2003  @xcite have pointed out that long period ( @xmath11 day ) bhbs undergoing outbursts tend to be associated with spatially resolved optically thin radio ejections , while short period systems would be associated with unresolved , and hence physically smaller , radio ejections .",
    "if a common production mechanism is at work in optically thick and optically thin bhb jets  @xcite , then the above arguments should apply to steady optically thick jets as well , providing an alternative explanation to the unresolved radio emission of xte j1118 + 480 , with its 4 hour orbital period , the shortest known for a bhb",
    ". it is worth mentioning that , by analogy , a long period system , like for instance v404 cyg , might be expected to have a more extended optically thick jet ( approved high spatial resolution observations of this system , with the high sensitivity array , will hopefully answer this question ) .",
    "in an attempt to assess the relation between accretion and jet production in hard state bhbs , corbel 2003 , and gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ( @xcite,@xcite ) have established the existence of a tight correlation between the x - ray and the radio luminosity ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , of the form @xmath14 . in those works ,",
    "10 hard state systems with nearly simultaneous radio / x - ray observations were considered ; the correlation was found to hold over more than 3 orders of magnitude in @xmath15 , up to a few per cent of @xmath16 , above which the sources enter the thermal dominant state , and the core radio emission drops below detectable levels .",
    "probably the most notable implication of the non - linear scaling was the predicted existence of a critical x - ray luminosity below which a significant fraction of the liberated accretion power is channelled into a radiatively inefficient outflow , rather than being dissipated locally by the inflow of gas and emitted in the form of x - rays ( this does not necessarily imply the x - ray spectrum is dominated by non - thermal emission from the jet , as most of the jet power may be stored as kinetic energy  @xcite ) .",
    "due to its low x - ray luminosity ( @xmath17  @xcite ) and relative proximity , the bhb in represented the most suitable known system to probe the radio / x - ray correlation beyond the hard state . indeed , deep vla observations , performed in 2005 august , resulted in the first radio detection of a quiescent bhb emitting at such low x - ray luminosities ; the level of radio emission  51 @xmath18jy at 8.5 ghz  is the lowest ever measured in an x - ray binary . at a distance of 1.2 kpc , this corresponds to a radio luminosity @xmath19 erg sec@xmath2 . by analogy with higher luminosity systems ,",
    "partially self - absorbed synchrotron emission from a relativistic outflow appears as the most likely interpretation .",
    "free - free wind emission is ruled out on the basis that far too high mass loss rates would be required , either from the companion star or the accretion disc , to produce observable emission at radio wavelengths , while gyrosynchrotron radiation from the corona of the companion star is likely to contribute to less than 5 per cent to the measured flux density .",
    "a062000 was observed simultaneously in the x - ray band with , its 0.3 - 8 kev spectrum well fitted by an absorbed power law with photon index @xmath20 and hydrogen equivalent column density consistent with the optical value .",
    "the corresponding 210 kev luminosity was about @xmath21 erg sec@xmath2 , a factor of two higher than in a previous observation , in february 2000 .",
    "the simultaneous observations of allowed us to test and extend the radio / x - ray correlation for bhbs by 3 orders of magnitude in @xmath22 .",
    "the measured radio / x - ray fluxes seem to confirm the existence of a non - linear scaling between the radio and x - ray luminosity in this systems ; with the addition of the point    @xmath23 provides a good fit to the data for @xmath22 spanning between @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) . the fitted slope , albeit consistent with the previously reported value of @xmath26 , is admittedly affected by the uncertainties in the distance to gx3394 , for which the correlation extends over 3 orders of magnitude in @xmath22 and holds over different epochs .",
    "even though the a062000 data appear to follow the hard state radio / x - ray correlation , since 2003 , when the compilation of quasi - simultaneous radio / x - ray observations of hard state bhbs was presented  @xcite , many outliers have been found . to mention a few ( those that came or were brought to the attention of this author at least ) : xte j1720318  @xcite,@xcite , swift j1753.50127  @xcite , igr j174972821  @xcite and xte j1650500  @xcite , while in the hard state , all appear to lie significantly below the best - fitting correlation ( figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "while a number of plausible ad - hoc ` reasons ' can be adduced on a source - by - source basis , it simply seems more reasonable to conclude that the radio / x - ray correlation may not be universal , or , at least , that there is no universal normalization .",
    "this casts doubts on the possibility of relying on the best - fitting relation for estimating other quantities , such as distance or bh mass .",
    "a global re - assessment of the radio / x - ray correlation will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "while adaf models predict the existence of bipolar outflows emanating from the surface layers of the equatorial inflow  @xcite , generally they do not address the importance of such outflows with respect to the overall accretion process in terms of energetics .",
    "ideally , one would like to be able to compare the total power carried away in the form of outflows / jets , with the total accretion power budget available to the black hole . as mentioned in the first section ,",
    "this has been done for a handful of nearby elliptical galaxies  @xcite ; there , the mechanical jets power is found to be comparable to @xmath27 .",
    "this has been interpreted as evidence that a substantial fraction of the captured mass does reach the innermost regions of the flow before being ejected in the form of an outflow . +",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached in the case of the stellar mass bh in a062000  @xcite . based on models for the optical / uv emission of the outer accretion disc in dwarf novae  @xcite ,",
    "corrected downward to account for the mass difference , mcclintock 1995  @xcite estimate @xmath28 yr@xmath2 for a062000 , where @xmath29 is a factor of the order unity , that can be up to a few .",
    "this value is also comparable to the @xmath30 yr@xmath2 inferred from the measure of the total energy released during the 1975 outburst of adopting 58 year recurrence time based on plate archives which showed an outburst in 1917 .",
    "this time - averaged value had been calculated based on a distance of 1 kpc for ( vs. a refined value of 1.2 kpc ) and could still be underestimated by a factor 2 or so , to allow for the possibility that an intermediate outburst was missed .",
    "the putative luminosity associated with @xmath31 , if it was to reach the black hole with standard radiative efficiency , would be @xmath32 erg sec@xmath2 , five orders of magnitude than the observed x - ray ( or bolometric ) luminosity . in the above expression @xmath33",
    "is the accretion efficiency , which depends only on the bh spin .",
    "the various riafs provide different explanations for the much lower luminosities that are observed in terms of different ` sinks ' for the energy .    in the adaf scenario",
    ", it is assumed that all the @xmath31 is accreted onto the black hole ( @xmath34 ) while the radiated luminosity @xmath35 is much smaller as a result of a reduced radiative efficiency @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the critical rate above which the disc becomes radiatively efficient .",
    "the index @xmath38 is typically close to unity , but its exact value may depend on the micro - physics of adaf and on how the bolometric luminosity is calculated . writing the bolometric luminosity of as @xmath39 erg sec@xmath2 , being @xmath40 a multiplicative factor , then @xmath41 . for @xmath42 , @xmath43 yr@xmath2 , which corresponds to an eddington - scaled critical accretion rate @xmath44 . with @xmath45 ,",
    "as implied by the adaf spectral modelling , a self - consistent adaf solution is obtained for @xmath46 of a few times @xmath47 , as expected on theoretical grounds .",
    "contrary to the adios case , for the adaf scenario to be self - consistent , the total kinetic power of the jet / outflow , @xmath48 , should be a negligible fraction of @xmath49 . in order to verify this ,",
    "@xmath50 can be estimated making use of the normalization for the jet kinetic power vs. radio luminosity derived by  @xcite .",
    "obviously , if this number is high enough , the jet contribution to the flow energetics ( and dynamics ) can be negligible with respect to advective cooling . in  @xcite the radio core emission of three well studied radio galaxies ( m87 , per a and cyg a )",
    "was directly compared to the radio lobe emission , used a jet calorimeter .",
    "they proposed that the jet kinetic power can be estimated from the core radio luminosity in the following way : @xmath51 erg sec@xmath2 where @xmath52 is the radio spectral index , and the parameter @xmath53 carries the ( quite large ) uncertainty on the radio galaxy calibration . for , assuming a flat radio spectral index @xmath54 , and for @xmath55 erg sec@xmath2 , there follows : @xmath56  erg sec@xmath2 , or @xmath57 .",
    "this would mean that the jet / outflow carries a significant amount of the accretion energy budget away from the system .",
    "i so , then any realistic accretion flow model for quiescence shall necessarily incorporate the effects of an outflow both in terms of energetics and dynamics , effectively ruling out a pure adaf solution .    using the estimate for the kinetic power of the jet in quiescence",
    ", we can calculate the total energy carried out by it in between outbursts , assuming again that the 58 years recurrence time is not overestimated .",
    "we obtain @xmath58 erg , of the same order of the energy released during an outburst .",
    "interestingly , @xcite calculated the outburst evolution for with a model accounting for evaporation of the cold outer disc ( but neglecting outflows ) , and concluded that only about one third of the mass accreted during quiescence needs to be stored in the disc for the subsequent outbursting episode . under the adios working - hypothesis , the mass flowing from the outer disc does not reach the inner region , but is lost in a outflow .",
    "the accretion rate is now a function of radius : @xmath59 where we have assumed that mass loss sets in within the truncation radius @xmath60 .",
    "proceeding as before , we can then estimate the truncation radius for @xmath61=@xmath62 , being @xmath63 the schwarzschild radius for a 10 bh .",
    "for @xmath64 we obtain @xmath65 or @xmath66 cm , to be compared with the orbital separation of about @xmath67 cm  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the the jet / outflow is powered by the mass lost from the accretion flow , then its total kinetic power @xmath50 is given by @xmath68 i.e. in the adios framework , a dominant fraction of the total accretion power is channelled into the jet / outflow .    in conclusion , by making use of the estimate of the outer accretion rate of a062000 in quiescence and of the jet radiative efficiency by  @xcite",
    ", it has been argued that the outflow kinetic power accounts for a sizable fraction of the accretion energy budget , and thus must be important with respect to the overall accretion dynamics of the system  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , as noted in the case of elliptical galaxies studied with chandra  @xcite , the large jets mechanical power ( compared to the available fuel supply ) suggests that , before being expelled and carrying away a substantial fraction of the dissipated accretion power , the accreted mass must flow deep into the hole s potential well , were high efficiencies can be reached .",
    "[ fig:1 ]   a062000  @xcite ( open circles ) .",
    "while this low eddington ratio system appears to confirm the validity of a non - linear radio / x - ray correlation over more than 6 orders of magnitude in @xmath12 , an increasing numbers of hard state outliers is being found at higher luminosities ( filled triangles ) , whose radio flux is typically lower with respect to the best - fitting power - law ( e.g. xte j1720318  @xcite,@xcite and swift j1753.50127  @xcite , igr j174972821  @xcite , xte j1650 - 500  @xcite ) .",
