    "a major problem in general relativity and cosmology is related to the effects of the cosmological expansion on gravitating local systems , such as the solar system , accompanying the expansion of the universe .",
    "this question has been the subject of studies since 1933 , with mcvittie @xcite .",
    "several models have emerged since then , and what is clear so far is that the way the local dynamics is affected strongly depends upon the choice of the specific metric to represent the system .",
    "small scale gravitating systems , small compared to the hubble radius , participate in the expansion , but the effect of the expansion being so small that can be neglected .",
    "in such cases , the global dynamics is well described by the friedman - lamatre - robertson - walker metric ( flrw ) , while the local dynamics is independent of the cosmological expansion and described by an independent metric .",
    "for large scale structures compared to the hubble radius , the cosmic expansion becomes significant and can not be neglected ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this situation , a fully dynamical metric including the effects of the cosmic expansion must be used . in the case of a local electromagnetic system",
    ", the analysis of @xcite shows that a strongly connected system can not be disturbed by the cosmic expansion .",
    "based on this , we can say that in an expanding flrw universe only weakly bounded systems take part in the cosmic expansion @xcite .",
    "however , it is still not clear what the effects of the cosmological expansion are on other , maybe more subtle , features of local gravitational systems such as the existence of trapping horizons in a black hole spacetime .",
    "on the other hand , the description of black hole dynamics is not well settled ; some points have been set aside as a first approximation to simplify the analysis .",
    "although the black hole thermodynamics relies on the discovery of hawking radiation @xcite , to avoid further difficulties the backreaction has been ignored in many studies about black hole dynamics in cosmic backgrounds .",
    "more complication arises when the black hole is immersed in a cosmic content other than a cosmological constant , as dark matter and dark energy dynamic fields ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an analysis of hawking radiation from black holes asymptotic to the einstein - de sitter universe ) . in this way , if the observations indicate @xmath0 , the possibility of the big rip provides another motivation for the study of local dynamics of black holes , because the event horizon can follow the expansion and disappear , exposing the central singularity @xcite . in general",
    ", the cosmic content tends to be incorporated into the black hole @xcite , and neglecting the accretion when modeling the black hole evolution results in unrealistic models .",
    "recently observational evidence has accumulated , mainly by the observations of sne ia , that sets the equation of state parameter as @xmath1 @xcite , showing that the universe goes through an accelerated expansion phase .",
    "this fact brought even more interest on the studies on the effects of the cosmic expansion on local gravitating systems .",
    "therefore , it would be very useful to have exact solutions of the einstein equations which could describe objects with strong gravitational field embedded in an accelerated expanding universe .",
    "further study on the already known exact solutions to acquire a full understating of the geometric and physical properties of such solutions is also an important task .",
    "this is one of the aims of the present work .",
    "the first known solution of einstein equations that has been written as an attempt to describe a spherically symmetric pointlike particle in an expanding universe is the mcvittie metric @xcite .",
    "in fact , such a metric may be used to investigate the effects of cosmic expansion on local systems .",
    "it is usually written in the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the cosmological time , @xmath4 is a radial comoving coordinate and @xmath5 is to be interpreted as the cosmological scale factor .",
    "it was first though that metric could describe the schwarzschild black hole geometry in a cosmological background . in this scenario the mass @xmath6 of the point mass ( or the central black hole ) is constant , there is no flow of energy towards the central object , or escaping from it .",
    "this non - accretion condition says also that the size of the central object does not change during the expansion .",
    "however , it has been argued ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , see also @xcite ) that the mcvittie metric can not describe a black hole evolving in an flrw universe due to the presence of a spacelike singularity at @xmath7 , which corresponds to an infinite pressure of the cosmic fluid surrounding the object .",
    "according to these authors , the metric describes a singular central spherical object , but the event horizon never develops .",
    "a timelike limiting surface and an event horizon are formed , but both shrink due to expansion . on the other hand , it is known that in the einstein - de sitter universe , in which @xmath8 , with constant @xmath9 , the mcvittie metric reduces to the schwarzschild - de sitter metric , and the central object described by this metric is a black hole .",
    "in fact , more recently it has been shown that if the cosmological expansion is such that for late times the hubble parameter @xmath10 ( with the over dot @xmath11 standing for the total derivative ) reaches a constant value , in which the spacetime asymptotes to the @xmath12cdm cosmology , an event horizon is formed and black hole and white hole regions are present in mcvittie solution @xcite .    straightforwardly from the mcvittie metric , one can build new black hole type solutions in cosmological backgrounds by replacing the mass parameter @xmath6 by a function of the cosmic time @xmath3 , @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , by taking @xmath14 , with constant @xmath15 , and defining a new radial coordinate @xmath16 by @xmath17 in metric  , we find @xmath18 which is a particular case of the thakurta metric  @xcite .",
    "of course , other choices of @xmath19 yield different geometries that may be interesting as candidates for representing black holes immersed in cosmological spacetimes ( see below ) . since the einstein equations are not invariant under the change @xmath13 one sees that such a procedure changes the sources .",
    "in the mcvittie solution the source is a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath20 given by @xmath21 , and pressure @xmath22 , by @xmath23/\\left[1-m/2ra(t)\\right]$ ] . in turn , for the thakurta metric the simplest source is a fluid with density @xmath24 , pressure @xmath25 , and with an energy flux @xmath26 given by @xmath27 in the radial direction .",
    "both spacetimes have singularities : mcvittie at @xmath28 and thakurta at @xmath29 .    with the aim of describing black holes in expanding universes ,",
    "other metrics have been written down .",
    "vaidya @xcite proposed a metric to describe a kerr black hole immersed in a cosmological background , which , in the case with no rotation , can be written in the form @xmath30 + \\frac{2 m}{r}\\left[\\frac{d t}{a(t)}+ dr\\right]^2   -d t^{2 } , \\label{vaidyametr - neutral}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a constant .",
    "vaidya argued that the metric represents a black hole whose event horizon is located at @xmath31 .",
    "however , this seems a more subtle question than initially believed , since the surface @xmath32 does not look like an apparent horizon ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a similar ( vaidya type ) metric as a possible representation of a kerr black hole embedded in the einstein - de sitter universe was examined by thakurta @xcite . as it was shown in @xcite , in the vaidya and also in thakurta solutions some of the energy conditions",
    "are violated . even though these possible drawbacks , more studies on these metrics are necessary in order to understand the complete geodesic structure of the corresponding spacetimes .",
    "another class of solutions found by sultana and dyer ( sd ) @xcite is also of interest for the present work .",
    "the sd metric , @xmath33 + \\frac{2m}{r}\\left[{dt } + { a(t)}dr\\right]^{2}-dt^2,\\ ] ] with @xmath6 being a constant , was proposed to represent a schwarzschild black hole in an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "this solution is similar to the mcvittie spacetime , but with the no - accretion condition being released , i.e. , in the sd solution there is matter ( energy ) accretion onto ( from ) the central object .",
    "another difference is that the mcvittie solution can be sourced by a single perfect fluid , while sd spacetime needs a mixture of two non - interacting perfect fluids , a massive dust and a null ( lightlike ) dust fluid . in sd solution , both in radiation and matter dominated era , some of the energy conditions are violated .",
    "notice that the sd metric   can be obtained from the vaidya metric   by replacing the mass parameter @xmath6 by @xmath34 .",
    "in other words , the vaidya and the sd metric differ from each other only by the rate of mass accretion onto the central body .",
    "finally we mention here the attempts made more recently as , for instance , the model proposed in @xcite in which the mass of the central object changes due to accretion of a phantom fluid , during the cosmic expansion , considering backreaction .",
    "this metric differs from the solution of @xcite ; however the results can not be compared effectively since the later does not consider backreaction .",
    "the charged black hole generalization of the mcvittie metric was found by vaidya and shah @xcite .",
    "later , a generalization of the vaidya  @xcite solution including electric charge in the source was written  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a very interesting charged solution was put forward by kastor and traschen  @xcite . starting with the majumdar - papapetrou multi - black holes static solution of @xcite",
    ", the authors found a solution of the einstein - maxwell equations which describes the dynamics of a system of charged multi - black holes in a cosmological background . among other interesting aspects",
    ", the solution furnishes an analytical description of the dynamics of coalescing black holes . in the case of a single charged black hole",
    ", the solution corresponds to the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole in a spatially flat einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "the global structure of the kastor - traschen spacetime was explored in @xcite .",
    "the construction of dynamical multi - centered black hole type solutions was generalized to an arbitrary flrw universe in a recent interesting work ( see @xcite ) .    following a different path , and long before the works on multi - centered charged black holes , in  @xcite it was put forward a charged version of the mcvittie , which is interpreted as a charged reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) metric embedded in a flrw cosmological background .",
    "the influence of the cosmological evolution on the size of the rn black hole , as well as the motion of a test particle close to central charged body , were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "several properties of such a spacetime were investigated , but the global structure was not explored yet .    in @xcite",
    "a set of metrics representing charged black hole type solutions in expanding backgrounds was displayed .",
    "the authors were interested mostly in verifying the energy conditions of the resulting spacetimes .",
    "they analyzed different charged metrics .",
    "the first one was a charged version of the mcvittie metric , corresponding to a particular case of the solution presented in  @xcite .",
    "a charged vaidya metric was also considered .",
    "other metrics studied there which interest us here were the charged thakurta  @xcite and the charged sd  @xcite metrics . a new solution , similar to the mcvittie spacetime ,",
    "was also considered in @xcite .",
    "the energy conditions were studied in all of the solutions and it was shown that some of them may be of physical interest .    some of the solutions considered in @xcite may be obtained from the corresponding charged static solutions through conformal transformations , from what some of the properties of the resulting spacetime could be inferred .",
    "however , other cases such as the vaidya type metrics are not obtained in such a way , and the sources of the electromagnetic field , as well as the matter content of the background , must to be analyzed with care .",
    "our aim in this paper is firstly investigate such electromagnetic sources in detail , and explore the main properties of the corresponding energy - momentum tensor .",
    "moreover , we also briefly investigate the global structure of the associated spacetimes .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to investigate the electromagnetic sources of some charged black hole type metrics in expanding universes .",
    "inspired by the charged versions of the mcvittie @xcite and vaidya @xcite type metrics previously considered in the literature @xcite , we write a sufficiently general metric with spherical symmetry and show that , under certain circumstances , there can be a global electric current in the radial direction . then , some particular cases are studied . in particular , the charged vaidya , sultana - dyer , and thakurta metrics reported in @xcite are considered . the mass parameters of these solutions , as well as the charge parameters ,",
    "are taken as a function of the cosmological time , and new charged solutions are then built .",
    "a brief analysis of each new metric is given .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec - gen - metric ]",
    "we write a sufficiently general metric and give the general form of the faraday - maxwell tensor , and of the stress - energy ( energy - momentum ) tensor of the electromagnetic field related to such a metric . the definition of apparent horizon is also given in that section .",
    "then , the charged mcvittie metric is studied in section [ sect - mcvittie ] , where attention is paid to the electromagnetic aspects of the solution .",
    "some aspects of the global structure of the corresponding spacetime are also considered .",
    "the studies reported in section  [ sect - mcvittie ] are not new , but the results are presented there for comparison to the other cases . section [ sect - vaidya ] is dedicated to study the general properties of a charged metric written based on the original work by vaidya  @xcite . here",
    "we replace the mass parameter of the original metric by an appropriate function of the cosmic time .",
    "again the main interest is on the electromagnetic quantities of the solution , and a brief analysis of the global structure of the resulting spacetime is given .",
    "the results about apparent horizons presented in this section are new results .",
    "a charged version of a metric originally given by sultana and dyer @xcite is analyzed in section [ sect - sd ] .",
    "it is shown that the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor corresponds to a situation where there is a global electric current across the spacetime .",
    "again , the mass and charge parameters of the original solutions are replaced by particular functions of the cosmic time and some aspects of the global structure , including the apparent horizons , of this new charged sd spacetime are also shown . similarly , a charged version of the nonrotating thakurta metric @xcite is investigated in section [ sect - thakurta ] .",
    "new mass and charge functions are considered , and some aspects of the global structure of the corresponding spacetime are also given . in section [ sect - conclusion ]",
    "we conclude .",
    "a sufficiently general metric for all cases we are interested here is of the form @xmath35 where @xmath3 is a timelike coordinate , @xmath4 is a spherical coordinate , @xmath5 is the expansion factor , @xmath36 is the metric on the unit sphere , and functions @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 depend on the indicated coordinates . to simplify notation we write @xmath41 .",
    "let us stress that we are going to analyze a few particular cases of electrically charged spherically symmetric black hole type solutions in expanding universes , for which the functions @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are given .",
    "for instance , in the case of the charged vaidya type metrics considered in section  [ sect - vaidya ] , one has the simple form @xmath46 .",
    "the same holds in the case of the sd and thakurta type metrics considered below . for these three particular metrics ,",
    "it results @xmath47 , and the radial coordinate @xmath4 plays the role of a comoving radial coordinate , analogously to the comoving radial coordinate in flrw cosmologies . with this in mind , we present in this section an analysis of the electromagnetic fields and sources for the given metrics by using the form given in equation   to represent anyone of these cases",
    ".    the general form of the faraday  maxwell tensor @xmath48 and the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor for the metric   are relevant to the present work . as a consequence of the spherical symmetry , the only nonzero components of @xmath48 are @xmath49 .",
    "the contribution of the electromagnetic field to the energy - momentum tensor , i.e. , the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor @xmath50 then is @xmath51 with all the other components of @xmath52 being identically zero .",
    "the maxwell equations give the two equations @xmath53 where we defined @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 being the only nonzero components of the electromagnetic current - density .",
    "the other components of the maxwell equations are identically zero .",
    "equation   gives that the quantity @xmath57 may be interpreted as total electric charge inside a sphere of radius @xmath4 at time @xmath3 .",
    "this means that , using equation  , we may interpret @xmath58 as the electric current across the spherical surface of radius @xmath4 at time @xmath3 .",
    "we are mostly interested in cosmological solutions with no net electric charge distribution across the whole spacetime .",
    "however , the location of the charged object can not be determined without specifying the explicit form of the metric functions in equation , and , moreover , since there must be some electric charge somewhere in the spacetime , the nonstationary character of the metric implies there exist some charge flux , i.e. , a current - density which , of course , depends on the choice of the coordinates .",
    "if one takes @xmath59 , one has from equation   @xmath60 , a function of time alone .",
    "the radial component of the current - density @xmath56 may be nonzero . therefore , there are at least two different solutions to equations   and which are interesting for the present analysis .",
    "one of which holds in a region of the spacetime where there are no electromagnetic sources , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , while the second is when electric current is allowed , i.e. , for a special choice of coordinates , one may choose @xmath61 but with @xmath63 .",
    "in the next sections , when studying charged versions of mcvittie , vaidya , sd and thakurta metrics , we return to this subject .    we can determine the total electric charge inside a spherical surface at a fixed radial coordinate @xmath4 for the spacetimes represented by metric  .",
    "let @xmath64 represent the spherical surface @xmath65 constants .",
    "the electric charge may be defined as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the unit normal to surfaces of constant @xmath3 , @xmath68 is the spacelike unit vector orthogonal to @xmath64 pointing outwards , and @xmath69 is the area element on @xmath64 .",
    "vectors @xmath67 and @xmath70 also satisfy the relations @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . in the case of metric",
    ", we may choose @xmath74 $ ] and @xmath75 , and the resulting expression coincides with equation  .",
    "such a definition of electric charge is applied to some particular cases below .      for the charged mcvittie , vaidya , sd and thakurta type metrics which are considered in the present work",
    ", the function @xmath5 in equation   corresponds to the cosmological expansion factor . in general , this function is defined by the matter content of the universe , after solving the full einstein - maxwell system of equations . however , regarding the kind of study being performed here we satisfy ourselves by taking two particularly simple cases , defined below .",
    "the first choice is , for comparison , the expansion factor used in  @xcite @xmath76^{2/3 } , \\label{factor1}\\ ] ] with @xmath77 being a constant to be chosen appropriately .",
    "this choice has an initial power - law expansion with @xmath78 and a final de sitter accelerated phase . from now on this choice",
    "is called the case ( a ) .",
    "the second choice is a power - law expansion , @xmath79 with constant @xmath80 , which corresponds to a universe filled with a perfect fluid whose equation of state is of the form @xmath81 , with @xmath82 .",
    "our choice shall be @xmath83 , and so @xmath84 , a cold dark matter dominated model .",
    "this is called the case ( b ) .",
    "besides the study on the electromagnetic sources , we investigate the curvature singularities and horizons of the chosen metrics .",
    "the interest on curvature singularities in the cosmological scenario is because they are physical , i.e. , true spacetimes singularities , meaning that physical quantities such as the energy density or pressure of the cosmological fluid diverge at the singularity .",
    "it is then necessary to calculate the usual curvature invariants which are built from the riemann tensor @xmath85 .",
    "as argued in @xcite , for a metric of the form given by equation  , the ricci ( @xmath86 ) and the kretschmann ( @xmath87 ) scalars are necessary to identify the spacetime singularities .",
    "these are calculated for each metric investigated in the present work ( see below ) .    in order to analyze the global properties of a spacetime",
    "whose metric has the form of equation  , it is useful to perform a coordinate transformation which brings in a new radial coordinate @xmath16 defined by @xmath88 with this , metric   assumes the form @xmath89\\,dt^2 + a(r , t)\\ ,   dr^2 - 2c(r , t)dr\\ , dt   + r^2\\ , d\\omega^2 ,      \\end{split }                          \\label{gen - metric2}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are given in terms of the original functions @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , but we do not write such relations here .    at this point",
    "it is interesting to find the equations for the expansions of the outgoing ( @xmath93 ) and ingoing ( - ) congruences of null geodesics , @xmath94 , where @xmath95 are tangent vectors to the radial null geodesics . using this definition and the geodesic equations for the metric",
    ", it follows @xmath96\\left(\\frac{dt}{dp}\\right)_\\pm , \\ ] ] where @xmath97 , @xmath22 being an affine parameter along the geodesic curve . for well behaved @xmath98 ,",
    "one then sees that the zeros of @xmath99 are given by the zeros of the function between brackets in equation  .",
    "this means that surfaces for which the product @xmath100 , if they exist , are located at regions of the spacetime satisfying the equation @xmath101 according to nolan  @xcite , which follows  @xcite , for a spherically symmetric metric , the zeros of @xmath102 , which are in fact the zeros of the function @xmath103 , defines a trapping boundary . for the kind of metrics we are interested here , these are also trapping horizons . on the other hand ,",
    "other authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) call such surfaces generically as apparent horizons .",
    "we follow the nomenclature of  @xcite .",
    "we can also verify that the zeros of the expansions @xmath104 coincide with stationary points ( regions ) of the radial null geodesics of the metric .",
    "in fact , the radial null geodesics are given by solutions of the equation @xmath105 where the plus ( minus ) sign indicates outgoing ( ingoing ) geodesics .",
    "we see also that the functions @xmath106 change sign at the zeros of the function @xmath102 , meaning that the zeros may be apparent horizons separating the spacetime into trapped and non - trapped ( regular ) regions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , for the metric of equation  , one has @xmath107 , with @xmath108 being the component of the inverse metric .",
    "indeed , this procedure of looking for the zeros of the function @xmath109 to find the possible apparent horizons of black hole type metrics in expanding spacetimes was followed by many authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite for mcvittie spacetime , @xcite for kastor - traschen solution @xcite , and @xcite for a thakurta type metric ) .      in the following",
    "we investigate a few particular charged metrics written to describe charged black holes in expanding universes .",
    "the main aim is to understand the physical nature of the electromagnetic sources of the corresponding spacetimes .",
    "another interest is to look for apparent horizons in each case , the ultimate goal is to determine if black hole horizons are really present , besides finding the spacetime singularities in order to identify the physical nature of the central object in each case . in order to do that , the complete geodesic structure of the given spacetime must be investigated .",
    "however , this study is lengthy and , moreover , all the metrics we consider here deserve a separate detailed analysis because of the interest on the subject in recent literature . hence , to avoid a very long paper , in this work",
    "we investigate only the form of the apparent horizons and the curvature singularities for each one of the studied metrics .",
    "the generalized version of mcvittie metric including the electric charge of the central body was put forward in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . here",
    "we review the electromagnetic sources of such a metric , and present a short analysis of curvature singularities and apparent horizons .      in the case of an asymptotically spatially flat flrw spacetime",
    ", the charged mcvittie metric may be obtained from the general form by setting @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , which gives @xmath113 , where the functions @xmath114 and @xmath115 are defined respectively by @xmath116 with @xmath6 and @xmath117 being constants related respectively to the mass and charge of the central body .",
    "the resulting metric is @xmath118 the function @xmath5 is interpreted as the expansion factor with @xmath3 being a cosmological time .",
    "the asymptotic metric ( @xmath119 ) results @xmath120 , which is the flrw metric in the case of flat three space .",
    "the above metric suffers from the same illness as the uncharged mcvittie metric , but at least when the hubble parameter @xmath121 asymptotes a constant at @xmath122 , such a solution has an event horizon and represents a black hole in an expanding universe ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "notice that a further generalization of the charged mcvittie metric is obtained simply by replacing the constant parameters @xmath6 and @xmath117 by function of the cosmological time , @xmath19 and @xmath123 . as discussed in the literature",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) , this implies in the violation of the non - accretion hypothesis of mcvittie , and there must be some kind of energy flux in the radial direction throughout the spacetime . in respect to the electric charge ,",
    "it means a non - constant electric charge of the source , and the presence of a radial electric current throughout the spacetime ( see also the next section ) .",
    "the electromagnetic source and the stress - energy tensor for the metric   were analyzed in  @xcite and then we do not need to reproduce the results here .",
    "however , further comments with respect to the maxwell equations are in order . according to our analysis in section  [ sec - gen - metric ]",
    ", the nonzero components of the faraday - maxwell strength tensor are @xmath49 , and for the charged mcvittie metric one finds ( see also @xcite ) @xmath124 the solution presented in @xcite assumes @xmath125 , leading to @xmath126 , and @xmath127 is a conserved quantity identified with the total electric charge of the source , so that @xmath128 , @xmath117 being the charge parameter of the metric .",
    "this result means that comoving observers in the charged mcvittie spacetime attribute a constant electric charge to the central object .",
    "furthermore , with such a choice , the einstein - maxwell equations in the presence of a cosmic perfect fluid are satisfied resulting in friedmann type equations for the energy - density and pressure .",
    "no additional terms in the density or pressure arise because of the presence of the electric charge .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one chooses @xmath129 , the maxwell equations are satisfied with the inclusion of a radial current - density given by @xmath130 , and the charge of the central object is not constant .",
    "in addition , in such a case there would be additional contributions to the energy density and pressure of the cosmic fluid coming from the electromagnetic field .",
    "for instance , the energy density has a term of the form @xmath131 , which , for @xmath129 and constant @xmath117 implies in violation of the energy conditions .",
    "this solution has not been investigated in the literature , since it is regarded as unphysical .",
    "it is worth mentioning that if we replace the parameter @xmath117 by a function of time and take @xmath132 , the maxwell equations are satisfied and the spurious term in the energy ( and pressure ) of the perfect fluid vanishes .",
    "however , in order to satisfy the einstein equations additional matter components must be added to the background .",
    "a detailed study of such a case is not the purpose of this work .",
    "as already mentioned , we do not investigate the complete geodesic structure of the charged mcvittie metric here , since a complete analysis is lengthy and out of the scope of this paper .",
    "however , the results on the singularities and horizons are of interest .",
    "we consider here just the case of constant mass and charge parameters @xmath6 and @xmath117 , and show the singularities and apparent horizons of metric for comparison to the other solutions investigated in the next sections .",
    "more details about the apparent horizons and singularities in the case of constant parameters @xmath6 and @xmath117 can be found in @xcite .",
    "to say something about curvature singularities of the charged mcvittie metric  , we calculate the ricci and the kretschmann scalars ( see [ appendixmcv ] ) . to simplify expressions it is convenient to use a new radial coordinate @xmath16 defined by @xmath133 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the ricci scalar is then @xmath134 , where we have written @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the kretschmann scalar is written in [ appendixmcv ] .",
    "we immediately see possible singularities when @xmath137 diverges , and at the region of the spacetime where @xmath138 , i.e. , for @xmath139 , or , in terms of the original coordinate @xmath4 , at @xmath140 . in the overcharged case ( @xmath141 ) , the function @xmath142 has no real roots and the singularity is at @xmath143 ( at @xmath144 ) .",
    "we consider here just the undercharged case ( @xmath145 ) .",

    "again , the search for apparent horizons is performed just in the case @xmath219 and @xmath194 , with constant @xmath15 and @xmath221 .    in terms of the new parameters @xmath15 and @xmath221 , for @xmath337 the curvature singularities",

    "@xmath341 , there is a curvature singularity at @xmath143 .",
    "since there are singularities in the generalized thakurta spacetime given by metric  , it is interesting to verify whether there are horizons hiding the singularity to external observers , so we look for apparent horizons . in terms of the metric  , apparent horizons ,",
    "if exist , are given by the roots of the equation @xmath342 , or @xmath343 which results in a third - order polynomial equation for @xmath16 .",
    "the analytical expressions for the three roots of the above polynomial equation for @xmath16 ( @xmath155 , @xmath158 , and @xmath157 ) are not written explicitly here .",
    "the solutions depend explicitly on the hubble parameter @xmath137 . restricting the analysis to expanding universes @xmath344 , so that @xmath345 , the nature of such roots depends on the charge to mass relation .",
    "a deeper analysis shows that for @xmath337 one of the roots , @xmath155 , say , is smaller than @xmath346 for all times , while the other two are larger than @xmath347 . on the other hand , for @xmath141",
    "there is only one real positive root of equation  , but as mentioned above we report here mostly on the undercharged case ( @xmath232 ) .",
    "the apparent horizons of the extremely charged thakurta metric ( @xmath348 ) have a similar time behavior as for the undercharged case .    if @xmath337 there is a curvature singularity at @xmath349 , with finite @xmath3 , and the three roots may be real and positive . according to the big - bang cosmological models , @xmath137 is large at early times and then , for small times , equation   has only one real positive root ( @xmath155 ) , the other two roots being complex conjugate to each other .",
    "as time goes on , @xmath137 decreases and there is a specific time @xmath350 for which @xmath351 when these roots become real and equal to each other , @xmath352 . thereafter , for all later times , the three horizons develop independently .",
    "the situation is depicted in figure  [ horizons - thakurta - under ] , where we plot @xmath156 and the three solutions of equation   as a function of the time coordinate @xmath3 for two cases of @xmath5 . at early times , the singularity @xmath349 ( @xmath3 finite ) is completely naked , and after some intermediate time @xmath353 an apparent horizon is formed at @xmath354 ; it immediately bifurcates into two branches that evolves independently .     in the undercharged case of the charged thakurta spacetime  , for two different expansion factors , as in the vaidya ( figure  [ horizons - vaidya ] ) and sd ( figure  [ ap - horizons - sultana ] ) metrics .",

    "asymptotically ( for @xmath122 ) , in the case ( a ) where @xmath360 , @xmath157 tends to a de sitter type cosmological horizon , @xmath361 constant in time ( @xmath362 is the largest real root of the equation @xmath363 ) . in the case ( b ) , where @xmath297 , @xmath364 tends to the hubble radius , @xmath365 . on the other hand , in both cases ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", @xmath158 tends to a black hole horizon . in the case ( a ) @xmath366 constant ( which is the intermediate solution of the equation @xmath367 , while in case ( b ) @xmath158 tends to the reissner - nordstrm black hole horizon @xmath368 .",
    "following @xcite , see also @xcite , we see that the region ( @xmath369 ) is a black hole horizon @xmath295 .",
    "notice also that , in the limit @xmath122 , for case ( b ) the ricci scalar tends to zero and the regions of the spacetime @xmath156 and @xmath370 are no longer curvature singularities . for this particular case ,",
    "the true singularity is at @xmath143 , as it follows from the kretschmann scalar  . with this",
    "we may infer that the boundaries of the resulting spacetime are similar to the reissner - nordstrm case .",
    "lets stress also that if the universe has a phase dominated by the cosmological constant ( at late times ) the hubble parameter @xmath137 tends to a constant , and @xmath158 tends to a constant value larger than @xmath156 , i.e. , @xmath371 constant , and thus a black hole horizon is formed . the cosmological - like horizon @xmath157 tends to a de sitter horizon ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in this case we may infer that the causal structure of the region @xmath372 of the charged thakurta type spacetime is similar to the mcvittie metric  @xcite .",
    "the mcvittie metric was proposed in 1933 and have being studied by many authors .",
    "though , we can say that a good comprehension of the global structure of the corresponding spacetime has been achieved only recently .",
    "it is then clear that a lot of effort is still needed to reach a good level of understanding on the other metrics that have been written to represent black holes in cosmological backgrounds .",
    "this is so for the vaidya metric @xcite , and also for the sultana - dyer @xcite and thakurta @xcite metrics .",
    "what we mean is that not even the original versions of such metrics were investigated in detail , and so any progress in the charged cases is of high interest .",
    "we started our study reviewing the charged metrics given in @xcite , and soon verified that the electromagnetic field of those solutions deserved further examination , since in some cases the correct sources of the maxwell electromagnetic field were not given .",
    "in particular , in the charged versions of the sd and thakurta metrics the presence of a radial current density across the spacetime was not observed .",
    "then , by the sake of comparison , we started by investigating this issue in the charged mcvittie solution given in @xcite , and also considered a charged vaidya type metric . in both cases ,",
    "maxwell equations were solved by choosing the faraday - maxwell field in such a way that the four - current density vanishes everywhere except at singular points ( regions ) of the spacetime .",
    "the total charge of the central object is a constant , and the stress - energy tensor emerging from such a faraday - maxwell gauge field exactly cancels the corresponding terms in the einstein tensor produced by the given metric . on the other hand , in the charged versions of the sd and thakurta type metrics ,",
    "the situation is a little more interesting .",
    "the faraday - maxwell tensor field related to zero four - current outside the source contributes to a stress - energy tensor which does not cancel the corresponding terms of the einstein tensor coming from the metrics given in @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to additional energy and pressure terms that have no direct physical interpretation .",
    "on the other hand , if one chooses the correct faraday - maxwell field so to get rid of the undesirable energy terms , then there is a global ( radial ) electric current throughout the spacetime , and the electric charge of the source varies with the cosmological time .    as commented above , further studies are necessary to complete the analysis of the metrics considered here .",
    "as we have shown , some of them present properties that may represent charged black holes in expanding universes .",
    "it is worth mentioning once more that the geodesic structure of most of those spacetimes were not investigated in the literature , not even of the uncharged original metrics .",
    "we are now investigating the global structure of the charged sd and thakurta metrics .",
    "the complete analysis , including the conformal diagrams , will be published in separate papers .",
