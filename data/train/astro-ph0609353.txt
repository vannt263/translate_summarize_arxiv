    "galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) are of great interest as nearby representatives of simple stellar systems all of whose stars share the same age and initial chemical composition cen here . ] .",
    "they are close enough that individual stars can be studied in detail with spectroscopy and photometry , while far enough away that , with some difficulty , their integrated light can be measured as well .",
    "their ages and initial mass functions can be determined through analysis of deep high spatial resolution imaging , primarily from hst ; mass segregation can be studied for these objects as well .",
    "integrated light measurements of galactic gcs are of key importance as they provide calibration data for the study of more distant early type galaxies with predominantly old populations as well as the gcs of distant galaxies for which only the integrated light can be observed .    the two micron",
    "all sky survey ( 2mass ) affords us a wonderful opportunity to study the surface brightness profiles of nearby gcs in the infrared . as described in detail by @xcite ,",
    "two 1.3 m diameter telescopes were used , one in the northern and one in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the whole sky was observed in three colors , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 ( a variant of the @xmath9 filter described in detail therein ) .",
    "the advantages for our purposes of the 2mass data over any previously existing are many .",
    "the photometry is all - sky with careful attention to calibration issues , ensuring uniformity over all the frames .",
    "the database is digital , and hence background subtraction and sophisticated image analyses are feasible .",
    "there are , of course , disadvantages as well .",
    "the effective exposure time for each point in the sky in this survey was short , only 7.8 sec in each of the three colors , so these images reach a relatively shallow limiting magnitude .",
    "furthermore the spatial resolution is limited by the adopted detector pixel size of 2.0  on a side .",
    "we describe here the process we have used to define and fit the surface brightness profile of galactic gcs in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2  from the 2mass data .",
    "the integrated light in the ir is sensitive to rare bright rgb tip giants and agb stars .",
    "hence centroiding in the ir is more subject to stochastic effects dependent on cluster richness than it is at optical wavelengths , where the numerous stars near the main sequence turnoff make a substantial contribution to the integrated light .",
    "we therefore begin by adopting the gc cluster centers determined from the on - line database for the galactic gc system maintained by w. harris @xciteeharris / weharris.html ] , as updated in 2003 ( henceforth h96 ) .",
    "these were derived from optical images of the gcs .",
    "the tidal radii of gcs are determined by the gravitational field of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , there is no hope of accurately measuring the surface brightness profile in the outermost parts of the galactic gcs from the short and relatively shallow 2mass exposures as the gcs are often very extended and the surface brightness near the tidal radius ( @xmath10 ) is low .",
    "we thus adopt the values of @xmath10 determined from optical photometry as compiled in the same on - line database ; these are primarily from @xcite ( henceforth tkd95 ) .    a square region , centered on the gc and with a side length of 2@xmath10 ,",
    "was used for each cluster .",
    "we downloaded the fits image files from the 2mass website batch image service that cover the required area for each galactic gc for each of the three filters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the most extended gcs ( clusters with @xmath11 ) are likely to have some missing data ( not a problem ) , and those with @xmath12 ( @xmath13 galactic gcs ) could not be analyzed at all due to excessive memory and cpu requirements .",
    "data for one such very extended gc , 47 tuc , was recovered from the 2mass large galaxy catalog .    processed frames from 2mass have 1.0  x 1.0  pixels and are tiled together in a regular fashion , with an overlap region between frames .",
    "the individual frames were made into a mosaic for each gc in each of the three ir colors by examining the header in each fits file to determine if it had neighboring frames adjacent to it , and then removing duplicated points in the overlap regions . because the tiling was not perfectly gridlike but rather somewhat staggered ,",
    "a few duplicate points were left behind and a few other points were removed that should have been kept , but this should have a negligible effect . when the frames were irregularly stacked ( as was the case in certain clusters ) , the mosaic procedure failed .",
    "this was fixed when it was not too difficult to do so by deleting selected frames from the data set ; less than 5 gcs were handled this way .",
    "frames were adjusted to a constant sky value and calibrated to a universal adopted magnitude zero point for each color ; we adopted values typical of those on the 2mass images , specifically 20.45 , 20.90 , and 19.93 mag dn@xmath14 arcsec@xmath15  for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the calculation relies on the photometric zero point determined for each frame by the 2mass project which is given in the keyword magzp in the header of each image .",
    "extinction within the earth s atmosphere is included in these zero points .",
    "the value of each pixel is reset to reflect the different depth achieved by each particular frame in the mosaic for each gc in each of the three colors . the sky value for each gc at each of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2  was simply taken to be the mean sky value of the individual rescaled frames , as indicated by the keyword sky in the fits header of each file . a detailed discussion of the algorithms used by the 2mass project to determine the values of these parameters for each frame is given in @xcite",
    "the background from non - member stars in the region of each gc was evaluated in a region largely beyond the tidal radius , extending from 0.95 to 2.0 @xmath10 .",
    "the calculation of the surface brightness followed that of @xcite , based on the method of @xcite .",
    "the image was divided into several annuli centered on the globular cluster .",
    "the 2mass detector pixels are 2.0  on a side , so the first annulus was a circle with a 5  radius .",
    "subsequent annuli went from 5  to 95% of the tidal radius , with the annuli evenly spaced in logarithmic space . if @xmath16 , 8 annuli were used ; if less than 10 , 10 annuli were used ; if greater than 10 , 15 annuli were used .",
    "the effective radius , @xmath17 , assigned to each annulus is the intensity - weighted mean radius of the annulus ( under the assumption of a linear intensity profile over the width of the annulus ; newell & oneil 1978 ) ,    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the inner and outer radii of the annulus .",
    "each annulus was divided into eight 45@xmath21 sectors , and the mean dn of the pixels within each sector was found .",
    "in the first annulus ( actually circle ) , as well as all annuli with @xmath22  , the mean of the 8 sector means was used as the surface brightness within that annulus , since the variations among the sectors for a given @xmath17 arise primarily from possible stochastic fluctuations and potential errors in the adopted position of the cluster center rather than from photometric errors or from non - member stars .",
    "for annuli with @xmath23  , the median of these 8 sector means ( in practice the average of the fourth and fifth value of the sorted list ) was chosen as the final value for that annulus .",
    "use of the median minimizes the surface brightness fluctuations due to a small number of bright stars , but biases the mean surface brightness towards lower values , since it effectively excludes some light from the brightest red giants ; however , this surface brightness profile is more representative of the bulk of the stellar population in the cluster .",
    "we initially adopt the centers of the gcs from the 2003 on line version of the database of @xcite .",
    "the majority of the cluster center coordinates in both h96 and in @xcite are from @xcite , and for most cases they are not expected to be determined better than to a few arcsec . while the centers from h96 generally appeared to be correct ,",
    "sometimes they seemed not to coincide with the center of a few of the gcs as judged from the 2mass images .",
    "an effort was made to develop a centroiding routine that would operate on the 2mass images , but stochastic effects made this difficult .",
    "instead , a specific list , based on visual inspection of the 2mass images , was made of gcs which might have centers in error by more than 2 arcsec from their nominal values .",
    "only those gcs for which the entire distribution of ir light appears shifted with respect to the nominal optical center are listed .",
    "gcs with an asymmetric distribution of the brightest giants within 1 core radius around the optical center such as ngc  5927 and ngc  6712 are not included here ;    the art of determining the location of the center of light for a gc is not trivial .",
    "we will demonstrate later that small errors of @xmath84 arcsec in cluster center position are probably common in the h96 database , as was also found by @xcite who analyzed archival hst images of the central regions of 38 galactic gcs .",
    "the new positions we thought might be appropriate for the centroids of eight gcs were carried along as additional clusters in the analysis and are listed in table  [ table_center ] ; a few additional cases of apparent centroid error are given in the last part of the table .",
    "for example , ngc  6541 has a central position in the 2003 version of the database of @xcite which is more than 12 away from its true location .",
    "the differences in @xmath2 and in @xmath5 for these small shifts for the 8 gcs are given in the fifth and sixth columns of this table .",
    "the resulting change in total brightness for these small differences in adopted gc central position can reach @xmath80.15 mag , which would directly affect an optical - ir color such as @xmath24 .",
    "the shift in a 2mass-2mass color such as @xmath5 is smaller .",
    "the position for the cluster center adopted here for the 8 gcs listed in the first part of this table is that which gave the larger signal at @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .      the field star background is major concern , especially for the gcs seen against the galactic bulge .",
    "while one could produce a cmd for the entire field of the mosaic image of a gc and then eliminate stars that do not lie along the expected cluster isochrone , we chose to adopt a scheme which is much easier to implement yet still succeeds in eliminating most of the brightest field stars .",
    "we calculate the @xmath9 magnitude of the rgb tip for each cluster from its known distance and interstellar reddening assuming @xmath25 mag .",
    "we then add a buffer of 1.5 mag .",
    "stars brighter than this @xmath9 are too bright to be cluster members .",
    "they were identified in the field of each gc from the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "the @xmath2 band was used to select non - members ; point sources that were deemed non - members in the @xmath2 band were also removed in the j and h bands .",
    "a 5 x 5 pixel area around such stars was deleted from the mosaiced image for sources fainter than @xmath26 , while for brighter stars , an area 11 x 11 pixels was deleted .",
    "this cleaning operation could not be carried out close to the core of the gc where there might be crowding , which region is larger than expected due to the low spatial resolution of 2mass , so we only selected and eliminated such sources for @xmath27 .",
    "the uncertainty in the surface brightness for each @xmath17 was the rms dispersion of the 8 sector values divided by two , taken in quadrature with the dispersion of the background measurements from the set of frames for a given cluster .",
    "the factor of two instead of @xmath28 reflects the difference between @xmath29 around a median instead of a mean ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      for each gc , the empirical king profile @xcite is fit to the surface brightness profile we determined for each of the colors @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we note that this formula is distinct from the dynamical king models @xcite , which were used in deriving the structural parameters in tkd95 and h96 ; however , for the purposes of the present paper , the effective differences are expected to be sufficiently small in the radial range of interest so as to be neglected .",
    "since the values for the @xmath10 and gc center positions are adopted from the current version of the on line database of @xcite , the remaining free parameters for which we solve are the central surface brightness ( @xmath30 ) and the core radius ( @xmath31 ) for each color .",
    "the fitting procedure to determine the surface brightness uses a weighting scheme for each point ( i.e. each value of @xmath17 ) based on its uncertainty , and returns the value of each of the two parameters and an error for each .",
    "the levenberg - marquardt fitting algorithm was used as implemented in idl taken from http://cow.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/down/mpfit.pro .",
    "all the codes required to determine the surface brightness profiles and to fit them were written by sh in idl .",
    "the minimum detection for a gc to be included here is a central surface brightness of at least 10 dn above the background with a clean detection in each of the first four annuli in each of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . of the 150 gcs in the current on - line version of @xcite , 105",

    "we matched our ir surface brightness profiles derived from 2mass images onto optical ones to construct such colors as @xmath7 .",
    "the surface brightness profiles at @xmath3 were taken from the literature .",
    "the primary source is tkd95 .",
    "they have carried out an analysis of the extensive material collected by the berkeley cluster survey ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as compiled many other sources of optical photometry , particularly @xcite .",
    "they then fit the homogenized set of data for each gc with a grid of single mass , isotropic , non - rotating @xcite models .",
    "values of @xmath31 , @xmath10 and central surface brightness appropriate for the @xmath3 filter were taken from their table  2 when available .",
    "the resulting king profile was then integrated out to the desired radius to obtain the integrated light at @xmath3 for a specified aperture .",
    "if there was no data for a specific gc in tkd95 , but the required parameters were given in the on - line compilation database of @xcite , the values there were used .",
    "nine of the gcs in our sample do not have a @xmath3 surface brightness profile considered accurate from either of these two sources .",
    "for all definite or possible core - collapsed gcs as listed in table  2 of tkd95 , we use the chebyshev polynomial fits to the @xmath3 surface brightness profile whose coefficients are given in table  1 of tkd95 . certain key information about how to use these chebyshev and polynomial fits to the observed surface brightness as a function of radius is missing from tkd95 as published , as are the extensive and useful notes to their table  2 .",
    "these were kindly provided to us by s.  trager and are now available through a link on his home page , see http://www.astro.rug.nl/~sctrager/globs/cheb_transform.txt and table2notes.txt . even with the aid of his notes , it was still difficult to make proper use of the chebyshev polynomial fits , and for 61  of the gcs in our sample , including all of the core - collapsed ones , aperture photometry was carried out by integrating the measurements of the compiled @xmath3 surface brightness profiles given in table  1 of tkd95 ( available through the on line edition of the aj ) to derive integrated @xmath3 magnitudes .",
    "a few gcs have surface brightness profiles in this table from tkd95 with an arbitrary photometric zero point ; these were ignored .",

    "their zero points are based on assuming photometric sky conditions prevailed at some particular time .",
    "they do not have the all - sky uniformity of the photometric zero points which 2mass has .",
    "this critical difference means that the errors of any @xmath3 surface brightness profile for the brighter gcs derived from reasonably deep digital ( i.e. ccd ) image are dominated by the uncertainty in its photometric zero point , not by random statistical measuring errors , centering errors , or stochastic errors from the finite number of very bright stars near the rgb tip .      in our initial implementation",

    "a minimum uncertainty of 1.0  was assumed for each of the @xmath31 ( including that of @xmath3 , whose uncertainty is not easily available from published material ) .",
    "the largest differences ( in units of @xmath29 ) occur among the core - collapsed clusters ( circled in the plots ) , where the optical @xmath31 , determined from material with better spatial resolution , are typically only a few arcsec , and are always smaller than the ir @xmath31 values .",
    "there is excellent agreement among the core radii determined from the various ir filters .",
    "the lower right panel illustrates this for the @xmath0 and @xmath2 filters ; the difference for each gc between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , normalized by the appropriate @xmath29 , is shown there .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath31 as listed in table  [ table_rcore ] are typically a few arcsec , and adaption of the independently determined @xmath31 for each of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2  led to unsatisfactory results , including , for example , the presence of many outliers in a plot of @xmath5 colors versus [ fe / h ] .",
    "the core collapsed gcs were among the worst of the outliers , as might be expected given their small @xmath31 . in view of the excellent agreement among @xmath33 , @xmath35 and @xmath34 for each cluster",
    ", we decided to tie the ir values of @xmath31 together .",
    "the set of @xmath31 values determined from the @xmath0 mosaics of each gc are presumably the most accurate among the three ir colors ; the sky is much darker than at @xmath1 or @xmath2 , while the central surface brightness at @xmath0 of each gc is only slightly smaller than in the other two ir filters .",
    "in addition , the stochastic effects are smaller at @xmath0 than in the redder filters .",
    "we thus set the @xmath1 and @xmath2 core radii to the value obtained from the @xmath0 mosaic of each gc .",

    "they include values based on observations of the ir ca triplet in individual gc red giants by @xcite , transformed onto their system , assuming a linear transformation applies .",
    "there are still very few accurate determinations of metallicity for the most metal rich galactic bulge clusters .",
    "we adopt the results of @xcite and @xcite for ngc  6553 and for ngc  6528 , the archetypical populous metal - rich bulge gcs with the smallest ( but still high ) reddening values .",
    "there are two other gcs in our sample with [ fe / h ] @xmath37 dex , terzan  5 and liller  1 .",
    "their adopted high metallicities are taken from @xcite ; neither is included in the compilation of @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , who analyzed high resolution near ir keck spectra for luminous giants in liller  1 and in terzan  5 , confirm the very high metallicity of both of these gcs .",
    "the moderate resolution ir spectroscopy of individual red giants in liller  1 by @xcite also supports a very high metallicity for liller  1 .",
    "all of the gcs in the @xcite compilation with metallicities higher than that of 47 tuc or m71 are in fact from @xcite .",
    "the ( high ) fe - metallicities we have adopted above for ngc  6528 and ngc  6553 then suggest that the relationship between ir ca triplet line strength ( the @xmath38 parameter of rutledge _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) and [ fe / h ] becomes non - linear at high [ fe / h ] , contrary to the assumption made by @xcite .",
    "of the high - metallicity gcs incorporated into the compilation in this way , only ngc  6304 is probably affected ( its [ fe / h ] being underestimated ) at a level exceeding 0.1 dex .",
    "results from the extensive program of @xcite , including high dispersion analyses of a sample of 24 galactic gcs , are not incorporated into the compilation of @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied only one gc with [ fe / h ] @xmath39 dex not already included in the more extensive compilation of @xcite , ngc  6352 ; their derived [ fe / h ] is within 0.05 dex of that from @xcite .",
    "@xcite do not include ngc  5272 ( m3 ) in their compilation .",

    "for the 64 gcs in our sample with no entry in the @xcite compilation or not specifically discussed above , the [ fe / h ] values given in the current on - line database of @xcite , which are primarily from @xcite , are adopted .",
    "the [ fe / h ] values we adopt and their sources are given for each gc in table  [ table_colors50 ] .",
    "we use the values of @xmath41 values given in h96 to remove the interstellar extinction .",
    "we adopt the reddening curve of @xcite , @xmath42 and 0.37 for @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "integration of the king profile fits out to a specified radius for each filter @xmath43 then produces the integrated light magnitudes of the galactic gcs .",
    "as discussed above , due to problems in using the tkd95 polynomial fits , we directly integrated the observed @xmath3 surface brightness measurements in many cases .",
    "we also ended up doing this for the ir colors as well for most of the gcs in our sample , as we will see below .",
    "we divide the sample of galactic gcs into three groups based on reddening and on the accuracy of the central surface brightness at @xmath2 of the fit king profile .",
    "the `` best '' group has snr(@xmath44 and @xmath45 mag for @xmath24 .",
    "a larger reddening can be tolerated for @xmath5 while still introducing a fixed maximum uncertainty in the color due to the much lower sensitivity of this color to a change in @xmath41 .",
    "taking into account the size of the range in color as well as the dependence of reddening on wavelength , we adopt a cutoff in @xmath41 of 1.0 mag for @xmath5 .",
    "the `` fair '' group has , for both of these colors , the snr limit reduced to 5 .",
    "the total sample studied here is 105  galactic gcs ; the number in each group is given in table  [ table_n_samp ] .",
    "since the values of @xmath31 and @xmath10 are fixed for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the photometric errors in ir - ir colors can be calculated directly from the uncertainties in the central surface brightness ( sb ) found from the king profile fits and the uncertainties in the background values .",
    "this ignores other sources of errors such as an incorrect choice of @xmath41 .",
    "if we assume a 20% uncertainty in @xmath41 , then an uncertainty in @xmath5 of 0.1 mag results when @xmath46 mag ; the reddenings of 5 of the gcs in our sample exceed that value .",
    "the centroiding error is less important , since the same center was adopted for each of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this straightforward error calculation of the photometric errors leads to substantial uncertainties for 2mass  2mass colors for the fainter gcs .",
    "the @xmath30 values deduced from the king profile fit are subject to centroiding and stochastic problems , which increase the dispersion among the 8 sectors in each radial annulus .",
    "this increase in @xmath29 increases the uncertainty in the derived @xmath30 , and hence the calculated uncertainty for the ir ",
    "ir colors .",
    "given the small range in ir ",
    "ir colors such as @xmath5 , an uncertainty larger than 0.1 mag is highly undesirable . for those gcs with @xmath47 mag",
    "as calculated from the king profile fit parameters , we therefore bypassed the king profile fits and instead directly integrated our own measured sb profiles from the 2mass images in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2  out to the desired radius of 50  rather than integrating the fit king profile .",
    "this is equivalent to aperture photometry with some censoring of the data to eliminate bright non - cluster members . in the end , this was done for for essentially all ( 104 ) of our sample of galactic gcs .",
    "we used the means for the central two annuli , and the medians for the outer annuli , so as to eliminate bright field stars .",
    "the uncertainties from statistical fluctuations in measurements in any 2mass  2mass color then become much smaller , as many pixels contribute to each measurement .",
    "thus the snr limits of 10 and 5 adopted for the `` best '' and the `` fair '' samples actually correspond to much larger values of snr .",
    "maximum errors in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2  using direct integration become 0.15 , 0.15 and 0.21 mag respectively .",
    "colors and their uncertainties for an aperture with a radius of 50  are given in table  [ table_colors50 ] .",
    "ir colors based on 2mass images can not be determined accurately for apertures much larger than the 50  radius adopted here due to the modest depth of these images .",
    "all colors in this table are reddening corrected and on the 2mass system .",
    "there are no blue outliers ; i.e. there are no gcs in our sample with @xmath48 mag .",
    "only two of the gcs in our sample are red outliers , with @xmath49 mag ; they lie beyond the maximum @xmath50 displayed in all our figures .",
    "they are ton  2 and djorg  1 , both of which have @xmath51 mag and neither of which can be regarded as well studied gcs with accurately determined metallicities or reddenings .    the uncertainties in ir ",
    "ir colors derived from measurement of 2mass images that are obtained via direct integration of our sb profiles are small as the expected random ( assumed gaussian ) fluctuations in measurement are small and the all - sky calibration of 2mass photometry eliminates errors in the photometric zero point .",
    "however , many more terms make substantial contributions to the uncertainties in optical  ir colors such as @xmath7 in addition to the expected random ( assumed gaussian ) fluctuations in measurement .",
    "optical2mass colors are seriously affected by non - random errors specific to each gc such as incorrect zero points for the @xmath3 photometry , incorrect choice of reddening , or perhaps to a smaller extent inconsistent choice of the adopted cluster center for the two filters forming the color .",
    "we consider the contributions to the uncertainty in an optical  ir color of two of these in detail .",
    "a check was made to determine how prevalent small errors for the gc center locations taken from h96 might be .",
    "we looked in the range of values of the background - subtracted amplitudes for the 8 sectors in the inner two annuli of each gc , establishing the ratio ( @xmath52 ) of the maximum to the minimum value in each color and checking the position angle of the sector that gave the maximum value of @xmath52 .",
    "about 2/3 of those checked with adequate signal level ( more than 100 dn in each color in each sector of the central two annuli ) showed systematic evidence for a centroiding error , with @xmath53 for at least 4 of the 6 possible combinations of filter and annulus , and in addition showed agreement in the sector position angle which gave the maximum signal between the first and second annulus for at least two of the three filters .",
    "it is highly unlikely that contamination by field stars could produce this in regions including and so close to the gc center .",
    "sampling ( stochastic ) errors can also be ruled out as the culprit as even some of the brightest gcs showed this .",
    "we therefore suspect that small errors of a few arcsec in the published centroid location of galactic gcs are common .",
    "examples of the implications of such positional inconsistencies on the derived magnitudes and colors are shown in table  [ table_center ] .",
    "the gcs included in that table are just those that early in the course of this analysis we happened to notice might have centroiding problems .",
    "we see that for two choices of cluster center location separated by @xmath85 arcsec integrating the fit king profiles produces changes in optical ",
    "ir colors reaching 0.2 mag ( only up to 0.1 mag for ir ",
    "ir colors ) , while integrating the ir sb directly produces changes which are generally smaller for both the integrated ir magnitude and the ir ",
    "ir colors .",
    "this is another reason why we decided to use direct integration in preference to integrating the fit king profile .",

    "[ figure_model_comp ] .",
    "construction of models , as well as prediction and testing of integrated colors from them , requires careful attention to the details of the calibration of any stellar or integrated light photometry used in that process .",
    "only the predicted ssp @xmath98 colors of @xcite reproduce the very red colors we find for galactic gcs at metallicities between @xmath103 dex and the solar value .",
    "it must be emphasized that the validity of the models can not be probed at metallicities above solar from this dataset , as the sample of well studied galactic gcs with such high metallicities is small to non - existent .    for an old ( age @xmath810 gyr )",
    "single - burst population , an uncertainty in color of 0.10 mag corresponds to an error in fe - metallicity of 0.25 dex for @xmath7 colors and to 0.7 dex for ir  ir colors ; the latter is so large as to render any conclusion regarding the metallicity of a gc useless .",
    "the apparent mismatch between the ssp model predictions and our @xmath5 colors suggests caution in using ir ",
    "ir colors to determine metallicities ( or ages ) for gcs in distant galaxies .",
    "we have mosaiced 2mass images to derive surface brightness profiles in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2  for 104 galactic globular clusters , incorporating algorithms to reduce the impact of bright field stars .",
    "we fit these with empirical @xcite profiles , adopting tidal radii and cluster center positions from the literature .",
    "this leaves only the central surface brightness and the core radius as parameters to be determined .",
    "we show that the resulting core radii for each of these three ir colors are identical to within the errors .",
    "we therefore set @xmath31 for each of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2  to be @xmath33 .",
    "we then show that the @xmath33 for each gc are identical to the core radii at @xmath3 in essentially all cases if the uncertainty for @xmath87 is taken to be 2  .",
    "the only discrepant cases are core collapsed gcs , where the lower spatial resolution of 2mass combined with the small optical core radii produce smaller measured core radii at @xmath3 than in the ir from 2mass .",
    "we derive integrated light colors @xmath4 and @xmath5 for these globular clusters .",
    "we do this by directly integrating the surface brightness profiles in most cases , equivalet to slightly censored aperture photometry , as this leads to smaller statistical measurement uncertainties than does integrating the fit king profiles .",
    "each color shows a reasonably tight relation between the dereddened colors and metallicity .",
    "fits of these are given for each color .",
    "linear fits suffice when the most metal - rich gcs are not considered .",
    "once the four gcs in our sample with [ fe / h]@xmath104 dex are included , a quadratic fit is necessary .",
    "we use our derived @xmath7 colors , combined with total @xmath105 from the database of h96 , to find the luminosity function at @xmath2 of the galactic globular cluster system .    the ir ",
    "ir colors have very small errors and very low dispersions about the fits due largely to the all - sky photometric calibration of the 2mass survey .",
    "these errors are consistent with the expected random fluctuations of the measurements based solely on the measured signal levels , indicating that other sources of error do not contribute much .",
    "the @xmath6ir colors have substantially larger uncertainties due in part to the lack of an all - sky photometric calibration for surface brightness measurements at optical wavelengths .",
    "incorrect choices for reddening , discrepancies in the adopted position of the center of a cluster , and , for the least populous gcs , stochastic errors due to the small number of luminous stars near the tip of the red giant branch , also contribute to the uncertainties in the @xmath6ir colors .",
    "we find good agreement with measurements of integrated light colors for a much smaller sample of galactic globular clusters by aaronson , malkan & kleinmann from 1977 .",
    "small constant offsets between the two datasets of @xmath80.1 mag in ir ",
    "ir colors are required ; we ascribe them to the difficulties of transforming between the filter and detector system used in 1977 and the 2mass system .",
    "we find excellent agreement with the ir ",
    "ir colors of @xcite , not surprising since they too use 2mass images from which to derive their colors . but",
    "a comparison at @xmath7 of our colors with theirs shows very poor agreement in the mean , and with a very large dispersion ; we suspect that they did not correctly match the optical and ir magnitudes in many cases .",
    "our results provide a calibration for the integrated light of distant single burst old stellar populations from very low to solar metallicities .",
    "we compare our dereddened measured colors with predictions from several models of the integrated light of single burst old populations , bearing in mind that the models have almost certainly been set up to reproduce the data of @xcite and @xcite for colors of individual red giant branch stars in galactic gcs .",
    "while there is reasonable agreement for @xmath7 colors , a @xmath80.1 mag offset is required in @xmath5 , with the model predictions being redder than our colors . until the origin of this problem is understood , any determination of [ fe / h ] ( or age ) in old populations based on ir ",
    "ir colors can not be considered valid .",
    "in addition , some of the models fail to reproduce the behavior of the integrated light @xmath7 colors of the galactic globular clusters near solar metallicity .",
