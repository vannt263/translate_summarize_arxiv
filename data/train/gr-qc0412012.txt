    "the term `` geon '' , short for `` gravitational - electromagnetic entity '' , was introduced in 1955 by john archibald wheeler to denote a classical gravitational configuration , possibly coupled to electromagnetism or other zero - mass fields , that appears as a long - lived massive object when observed from a distance but is not a black hole @xcite . while a precise definition of a geon seems not to have been sought , the examples studied in @xcite had spatial topology @xmath8 and with one exception an asymptotically flat infinity , where mass could be defined by what are now known as adm methods .",
    "the one exception was melvin s magnetic universe @xcite , which was subsequently deemed not to qualify as a geon , precisely because of its cylindrical infinity  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , while melvin s universe is stable @xcite , these geons were not , owing to the tendency of a massless field either to disperse to infinity or to collapse into a black hole .",
    "this tendency has more recently been much studied in the context of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse  @xcite .    in 1985 ,",
    "sorkin @xcite denoted by `` topological geons '' gravitational configurations whose spatial geometry is asymptotically flat and has the topology of a compact manifold with one puncture , the omitted point being at the asymptotic infinity .",
    "this generalises wheeler s geon in the sense of allowing nontrivial spatial topology and a black hole horizon .",
    "an example of a topological geon that is a black hole is the space and time orientable @xmath9 quotient of the kruskal manifold known as the @xmath10 geon  @xcite .",
    "this spacetime has an asymptotically flat exterior region isometric to a standard schwarzschild exterior and is hence an eternal black hole .",
    "however , while in kruskal the spatial hypersurfaces are @xmath11 wormholes with two asymptopias , the spatial topology of the @xmath12 geon is @xmath13point at infinity@xmath14 .",
    "geon was discussed prior to @xcite in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an early discussion on quotients of kruskal can be found in @xcite and a modern one in  @xcite .",
    "the euclidean - signature section of the @xmath12 geon is discussed in  @xcite . ]    as an eternal black and white hole spacetime , the @xmath12 geon is not an object one would expect to be formed in astrophysical processes .",
    "its interest is that as an _ _ un__conventional black hole , it provides an arena for probing our understanding of black holes both in the classical and quantum contexts .",
    "for example , in @xcite the @xmath12 geon was used to illustrate a classical topological censorship theorem , and the hamiltonian dynamics of spherically symmetric spacetimes with geon - type boundary conditions was investigated in @xcite . the hawking(-unruh ) effect on",
    "the @xmath12 geon was analysed for scalar and spinor fields in @xcite , addressing questions about the geon s entropy and its statistical mechanical interpretation .",
    "the @xmath15 dimensional asymptotically ads analogue of the @xmath12 geon was used in @xcite to probe ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present new families of geon - type black holes in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions for einstein s theory coupled to gauge fields . we shall not attempt to give a precise definition of `` geon - type black hole '' , but we require the spacetimes to be time orientable and foliated by spacelike hypersurfaces with a single asymptotic region .",
    "we also require the asymptotic region to be stationary and ` simple ' in a sense that allows conserved charges to be defined by appropriate integrals .",
    "we also consider geon variants of certain black branes that appear in string theory .",
    "we find that while the @xmath12 geon generalises readily into static vacuum geons in any dimension , the inclusion of @xmath16 gauge fields is more subtle and depends sensitively on the dimension , in most cases requiring the field strength to be a section of a bundle that is twisted by the spatial fundamental group or by some quotient thereof .",
    "such twisting is in particular required for electrically charged reissner - nordstrm in any spacetime dimension and for magnetically charged reissner - nordstrm in even spacetime dimensions .",
    "similarly , while the rotating @xmath15-dimensional black hole has geon - type variants for any values of the angular momentum aminneborg - bengtsson - holst , brill - samos , brill - weimar , we find that that the options for building geons from the rotating kerr - myers - perry(-ads ) solutions myers - perry , hawking - hunter - tr , gibbons - lu - page - pope1,gibbons - lu - page - pope2,gibbons - perry - pope depend sensitively on the dimension .",
    "with a negative cosmological constant , we also present rotating geons with a flat horizon . as an example of a nonabelian gauge field ,",

    ", the gauge field can be interpreted as a connection in a principal @xmath328 bundle .",

    "a similar argument is not available since the @xmath331 bundle on the universal covering space is already nontrivial , but the existence of the @xmath328 bundle can be verified directly .",
