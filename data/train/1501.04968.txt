    "however , measuring the distribution of dm from the internal kinematics of dsphs has proven to be challenging .",
    "their low surface brightness plus their relatively large heliocentric distances limit the number of stellar tracers for which kinematic information can be obtained and also reduce the phase - space information to quantities projected along the line of sight .",
    "in addition , as foreground contaminants tend to dominate in number in the outskirts of these galaxies most spectroscopic surveys suffer from strong sampling biases that severely complicate the dynamical analysis of these objects . given the number and graveness of these shortcomings it is perhaps not surprising that different methods that aim to measure the mass profile of milky way dsphs yield contradictory results .",
    "for example , whereas some studies find evidence for constant - density dm cores @xcite , other methods often applied to the same data suggest centrally - divergent ` cusps ' @xcite or remain inconclusive @xcite .",
    "recent numerical studies have shown that the dynamical properties of tidal streams are sensitive to the internal mass distribution of the progenitor system @xcite . using high - resolution n - body simulations we show in this paper that the distribution of dark matter in dsphs plays an important role in defining the orbits of tidally stripped stars , and that the dynamics of stellar streams provide constraints on the dark matter halo profile of dsphs which are complementary to those inferred from the internal kinematics of the progenitor galaxy .",

    "the dsph parameters are chosen such that for a given spatial segregation both cored and cuspy dm haloes have the same mass enclosed within the half - light radius @xmath23 at @xmath24 .",

    "we fit a plummer profile to the dm particles weighted by the corresponding mass - to - light ratio . to avoid contamination with ` extra - tidal ' particles we follow an iterative approach , where only @xmath42 of the particles within a radius of @xmath43{kpc}$ ] to the dsph are fitted at a time . then using the fitted plummer parameters we derive the radius that contains @xmath42 of the stellar mass and repeat the fit again",

    "previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that tidal effects tend to lower the velocity dispersion and increase the half - light radii of stars embedded within @xcite halos , and that the structural changes in the stellar component of these galaxies follow well - defined _ evolutionary tracks _ that are mainly controlled by how much ( and not how ) the mass @xmath40 enclosed within the half - light radius @xmath2 varies .",
    "[ fig : tracks ] shows that this result also holds for galaxies embedded in cored dm haloes .",
    "however , while the tidal tracks associated to cuspy dm haloes scarcely depend on the spatial segregation of the stellar component within the dm halo , as shown by @xcite , those associated to cored dm haloes appear to be sensitive to the initial value of @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , we find that the half - light radius increases to a larger extent the more deeply segregated the stars are within the dm core . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", it is useful to parametrize the evolutionary tracks using the empirical formula of @xcite @xmath44 the best - fitting parameters are listed in table [ tab : parameters ] and the resulting tracks are plotted with dotted and dashed lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : tracks ] .",
    "[ fig : tracks ] also shows other points of interest .",
    "first , note that at a fixed remnant mass @xmath5 cored progenitors have larger half - light radii and colder velocity dispersions than their cuspy counterparts .",
    "this difference can be easily understood in terms of the dynamical time of the progenitor galaxies , which scales as @xmath45 . because @xmath46 at @xmath47 we find that stars embedded in dm cusps react adiabatically to external perturbations .",
    "in contrast , stars embedded in cored dm haloes tend to absorb a relatively large amount of energy during tidal encounters , which leads to an overall expansion and a low kinematic temperature once dynamical equilibrium is reached .    a second interesting point can be gleaned from the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tracks ] , which shows the fraction of stars lost to tides versus the remnant mass .",
    "we find that at a given remnant mass cored dsph models lost _ less _ stars than their cuspy counterparts .",
    "this apparently counter - intuitive result arises from the dichotomy between the shapes of the stellar and dm density profiles .",
    "whereas stars in in cored dm halo models tend to be associated to the most - bound dm particles , in cuspy dm haloes a large fraction of particles with high binding energy are located within the density cusp and have a low probability of tagging a star , i.e. a high mass - to - light ratio .",
    "e.g. for cuspy models with @xmath48 , one finds that @xmath49 of the stellar particles are associated to the @xmath50 most - bound dm particles , while in cored models this fraction falls to a mere @xmath51 .",
    "note , however , that because dsphs embedded in cored dm haloes are in general less resilient to tidal stripping , these models tend to evolve at a faster pace along the evolutionary tracks than those embedded in cuspy haloes ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .     and velocity dispersion @xmath52 of the streams normalized to the half - light radius and luminosity - averaged velocity dispersion of the progenitor dsph , respectively .",
    "we show data at a fixed snapshot ( 4^th^ apocentre ) of the simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : streamevol ] . we distinguish between dsph models embedded in cuspy ( open symbols ) and cored ( filled symbols ) dm haloes .",
    "symbols are colour - coded according to the pericentric passage at which particles became tidally unbound .",
    "we mark the cylindrical distance @xmath53 to the galactic centre of segments within the range @xmath54{kpc } \\leq r \\leq \\unit[100]{kpc}$ ] .",
    "notice the clear kinematic offset of the streams depending on the dm halo profile .",
    "in this section we compare the properties of stellar streams associated to cored and cuspy progenitors . as expected , fig .",
    "[ fig : streamevol ] shows that tides are strongest at pericenter and trigger recurring episodes of mass loss at every pericentric passage .",
    "comparison between the upper and lower panel reveals that tidal mass loss is more pronounced in dsphs embedded in cored dm haloes .",
    "indeed , although not shown here the cored dsph is fully disrupted during the 5th encounter , whereas the cuspy dsph still retains a bound remnant .    at each snapshot",
    "we quantify the mass @xmath5 .",
    "the width @xmath55 and the velocity dispersion @xmath56 of particles moving along the tidal tails are measured in the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane at fixed cylindrical distances @xmath57 from the host galaxy centre .",
    "these quantities are then normalized by the half - light radius and the velocity dispersion of the stream progenitor as given by equation  2 for the corresponding value of @xmath5 . to reduce noise we apply the same averaging",
    "is it was done with the tracks .",
    "[ fig : sigmawidth ] shows that tidal streams become very narrow and kinematically hot at small distances from the host and get wider and colder with increasing @xmath53 , as also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : streamevol ] , as one would expect from liouville s theorem .",
    "in order to understand the internal evolution of the stream properties it is useful to distinguish between particles lost at different pericentric passages . we define a _ wrap _ as the ensemble of particles stripped at the same pericentre encounter .",
    "each wrap is then divided into _",
    "segments _ according to their cylindrical distance @xmath53 to the galactic centre . wraps that formed during recent pericentric passages tend to be found at close distances from the progenitor galaxy , as it takes a few orbital periods for these particles to populate the entire orbit .",
    "in contrast stars stripped at earlier times can in some cases wrap around the host galaxy entirely .",
    "comparison between different wraps in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmawidth ] shows that streams associated to dsphs embedded in cored dm haloes have similar widths but higher velocity dispersions than their cuspy counterparts .",
    "this is so regardless of the galactocentric radii at which these quantities are measured .",
    "also , wraps that form during early encounters tend to have higher velocity dispersions than those formed recently .",
    "this trend arises because the velocity dispersion of the dwarf galaxy decreases at a faster pace ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tracks ] ) than the velocity dispersion of the associated stream . hence , tidal streams appear kinematically _ hotter _ with respect to to the progenitor s velocity dispersion as they become _",
    "older_.    .",
    "symbols denote particles lost at different pericentric passages ( wraps ) , whereas colours distinguish between different snapshots .",
    "the width and velocity dispersion ratios roughly follow the ratio between the tidal evolutionary tracks of cuspy and cored dsphs as given by equation  2 , which we plot with a dotted line for ease of reference . ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmawidth ] shows that both the width and the velocity dispersion of tidal streams are highly dependent on the progenitor s orbit , the number of orbital periods completed , and the galactocentric radius where these quantities are measured .",
    "interestingly , fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmawidth2nd ] shows that plotting the ratios @xmath58 and @xmath59 at fixed segments collapses the degeneracy between these effects into a single relation , which roughly follows the path defined by the tidal evolutionary tracks of the progenitor galaxies , equation  2 , evaluated for the corresponding values of @xmath5 for the cuspy and cored models ( shown with dotted lines for ease of reference ) .",
    "this result suggests that the evolutionary path of the stream in this plane is mainly driven by the disparate structural evolution of galaxies embedded in cored and cuspy dm haloes as a result of tidal mass loss ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tracks ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmawidth2nd ] , there is an intrinsic offset between the various properties of the stream which can be understood using simple dynamical arguments .",
    "if we assume , as in @xcite , that the stream width is proportional to the tidal radius of the progenitor at pericentre @xmath60 , and that the velocity dispersion of the stream scales as @xmath61 , one finds that for the orbits plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmawidth2nd ] the width and velocity dispersion ratios are @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively ( see section 2 ) .",
    "[ fig : sigmawidth2nd ] shows that these simple analytical estimates , marked with a black cross for ease of reference , faithfully describe the numerical results .",
    "it is straightforward to show that for models with smaller stellar segregation @xmath6 with the same values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 this offset increases .",
    "this is in agreement with our models for @xmath64 ( not shown here ) .",
    "we have used @xmath0-body simulations to follow the evolution of dsphs as driven by galactic tides .",
    "our models adopt cosmologically - motivated mass profiles where dsphs are embedded in extended dark matter haloes with density profiles that have either a centrally - divergent ` cusp ' or an homogeneous - density ` core ' . as in previous studies ,",
    "we find that the half - light radius @xmath2 , velocity dispersion @xmath3 and stellar mass @xmath4 of dsphs acted on by tides follow well - defined evolutionary tracks that are mainly controlled by the remnant mass @xmath5 enclosed within the half - light radius .",
    "crucially , these tracks also appear to be remarkably sensitive to the adopted shape of the halo mass profile ( cusp / core ) , and also to a minor extent to the degree of segregation of stars within the dark matter halo .",
    "our models indicate that the differences in the evolutionary paths are reflected upon the internal dynamics of the associated tidal streams . in particular , after normalizing the stream width and velocity dispersion by the half - light radius and internal dispersion of the remnant progenitor , respectively , we find that _ tidal streams of dsphs embedded in cored dark matter models tend to be systematically hotter than their cuspy counterparts_. the kinematic offset arises during pericentric encounters and",
    "becomes more pronounced as the age of the stream increases .",
    "the results presented in this letter call for a simple method for inferring the distribution of dark matter in dsphs with associated stellar streams .",
    "first , one would derive @xmath65 by measuring the stellar mass in the stellar stream and in the remnant galaxy .",
    "for a given dark matter halo profile and a given initial stellar segregation this observation will fix the position of the galaxy on the tidal tracks shown in fig  [ fig : tracks ] , and thus the properties of the progenitor system prior to tidal stripping .",
    "models that reproduce the observed @xmath2 and @xmath3 lead to @xmath66 .",
    "having set the initial conditions of the dwarf galaxy , the next step corresponds to modelling the orbit and the mass evolution of the progenitor system simultaneously in a given host potential .",
    "this can be done with the aid of self - consistent n - body models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or , alternatively , with efficient semi - analytical algorithms based on forward modelling of stellar streams ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
