    "the sunyaev  zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite is scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by electrons in the intervening gas throughout the universe .",
    "the sz effect is generally subdivided into two subcomponents : the kinetic effect due to the bulk motion and the thermal effect due to energy transfer from hot electrons .",
    "the latter is expected to be the largest modification to the background temperature during photon transit from the last scattering surface .",
    "we will concentrate on it hereafter and refer to it as the sz signal .",
    "the strongest sz perturbations to the cmb temperature are dominated by scattering of photons via hot electrons in massive galaxy clusters @xcite , but there could also be an sz signal from reionization @xcite .",
    "the integrated sz angular power spectrum is now a known probe of the amplitude of density perturbations , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the sz effect has been clearly imaged toward individual galaxy clusters @xcite and has been used for a variety of applications , including a measurement of the cmb temperature at the redshifts of coma and a2163 @xcite . however , the amplitude of the sz power spectrum at arcminute angular scales , generated from unresolved galaxy clusters , is still not well established with differences at the 2@xmath1 level from a variety of detections and limits @xcite .",
    "existing sz anisotropy measurements are restricted to observations with a narrow frequency coverage and to small areas on the sky .",
    "the differences could be a combination of foreground contamination and large non - gaussian variance of the sz signal  @xcite .",
    "also , no constraints on the sz signal exist at tens of arcminute scales where primary cmb fluctuations dominate .",
    "a clean separation of the sz anisotropies from primordial cmb is possible due to the fact that the sz signal has a distinct frequency spectrum from the 2.7k blackbody spectrum @xcite .",
    "the spectral difference arises as inverse - compton scattering leads to , on average , a net energy gain for the cmb photons and the scattered photons move from the low frequency rayleigh",
    " jeans ( rj ) tail to high frequencies @xcite .",
    "the sz sky is colder than the cmb at low frequencies and hotter than the cmb at high frequencies with no difference at about a frequency of 217 ghz . a potential detection of the large - scale structure sz fluctuations is then aided by observations across the sz null from the negative side to the positive side .    a dataset of the form needed for a study of the large - scale structure sz effect is provided by the 2003 flight of the balloon - borne experiment @xcite .",
    "this instrument derives directly from the payload that was flown in 1998 and resulted in first high signal - to - noise maps of the cmb anisotropy with sub - horizon resolution @xcite .",
    "the instrument was launched by nasa on 2003 january 6 from williams field near mcmurdo station , in antarctica .",
    "the flight lasted a total of 311 hours until 2003 january 21 and 119 hours of this observing period were devoted to scanning a deep survey region .",
    "the remaining time was spent on scanning a larger shallow survey and a section of the galactic plane . here",
    ", we concentrate on a search for sz effect in the central deep field over 100 deg@xmath5 with the highest signal - to - noise ratio .    in this letter , we report the first statistical limits of the sz signal at sub - degree angular scales at these wavelengths .",
    "the discussion is organized as follows : in section [ sec : sepsz ] we detail our approach to extract the sz signal from the multifrequency dataset ; in section [ sec:3 ] we detail our simulations used to estimate statistical and systematic uncertainties ; and in section [ sec:4 ] we present our results .",
    "( eq .  1 ) for the data ( blue triangle ) and simulations in ( @xmath0k)@xmath5 rj units in the first multipole bin ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the six independent points of the @xmath7 matrix correspond to correlation between frequencies labeled 0 , 1 , and 2 for 145 ghz , 245 ghz , and 345 ghz respectively .",
    "we show two sets of distributions for simulations .",
    "the smaller distribution takes into account only instrumental noise and cosmic variance .",
    "the larger distribution includes also primary cmb and foregrounds by taking the rms of three different amplitudes for the components ( see text ) . in the case where only one error bar is visible ,",
    "the rms from foreground is smaller than the instrumental noise and cosmic variance .",
    "the inserted plot shows the distribution of @xmath8 with the data value inserted as a vertical blue line.,width=302 ]",
    "to separate the sz signal from all other sources of anisotropies , we adopted a technique well - known in the literature for removing foregrounds from the cmb anisotropies @xcite . in our case ,",
    "instead of recovering the primordial cmb signal , we recover sz fluctuations by minimizing the covariance relative to the sz frequency dependence , and treat primordial fluctuations as another source of noise . in the remainder of this letter , we will refer to `` foregrounds '' as all the additional emissions ( cmb , galactic dust , far - ir sources or firb , radio point sources ) to the sz effect",
    ".    the power spectrum of the sz can be obtained from a weighted mean of the power spectra at different frequencies : @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the weights @xmath10 at each frequency @xmath11 and multipole @xmath12 can be obtained by minimizing the covariance of data multipole moments @xmath13 subject to the constraint that sz estimation is unbiased ( @xmath14 ) .    in the case of maps ,",
    "each frequency channel consists of several detectors .",
    "we distinguish individual detectors with the indices @xmath15 , while @xmath16 are indices for the frequency channels . in order to minimize instrumental noise more aggressively ,",
    "we compute the covariance matrix of the signal by averaging all the combinations of cross - spectra between different detectors and ignoring the auto - spectra of the same detector .",
    "the contribution of the correlated noise between two different detectors is taken into account in the simulations and removed as part of a residual contribution to the sz signal .",
    "we construct the binned covariance matrix in multipole @xmath12 bin @xmath17 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the sz frequency dependence at each of the frequency bands relative to cmb with @xmath20 , @xmath21ghz , and @xmath22 is the measured beam window function for the detector @xmath23 in channel @xmath11 .",
    "note that with the definition above , in the rj limit @xmath24 so that @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the sz anisotropy power spectrum in the rj limit .",
    "the covariance matrix c@xmath27 is required to be invertible and positive definite .",
    "we numerically check this both in data and simulations . in figure  [ fig:1 ] we show the covariance matrix from data and compare it to simulations described below .    using the data covariance matrix ,",
    "the optimal weights for the sz reconstruction are @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a unit vector , @xmath30 .",
    "the channels consist of eight polarization - sensitive bolometers at 145 ghz , and four spider - web bolometers at each of 245 ghz and 345 ghz channels .",
    "we make use of data from all these detectors except two detectors that were known in prior studies to be dominated by detector noise ( 245x and 345z ) @xcite and two detectors with a significantly higher noise than the others ( 145z2 and 345y ) , leaving us with seven detectors at 145 , three at 245 and two at 345 ghz .",
    "we use the spectral response of each band as measured in lab with sub - percent accuracy . from these bands we derived the values of ( 0.49722 , -0.21646 ,",
    "-1.01643 ) for @xmath31 at 145 , 245 and 345  ghz respectively .",
    "these bands provide ideal frequency coverage for an sz study with channels in the sz decrement , near the null , and the increment , respectively .",
    "the measured fwhm of the beams is 11.5 , 8.5 , and 9.1  arcmin for the 145 , 245 , and 345 ghz channel , respectively  @xcite .",
    "these values include a 2.4  arcmin pointing jitter .",
    "the beams window functions @xmath22 are in fact numerically derived from physical optics simulations , combined with a gaussian pointing jitter .",
    "similar to prior studies with data , we produced cmb temperature anisotropy ( t ) maps using the italian analysis pipeline @xcite and the tt power spectra with the master method  @xcite . to remove excess atmospheric noise ,",
    "we filtered out time - ordered data in each of the detectors in frequency space below 200  mhz .",
    "this results in a damping of power at angular scales above 1.2@xmath32 .",
    "the effect of this filter , of the scanning strategy , of the sky coverage , and of the pixelization results in an effective window function .",
    "this window function is estimated by projecting signal - only sky simulation into detector time - streams .",
    "to do that we used 10 sky simulations of the sz signal , obtained from @xcite with different normalizations and initial conditions .",
    "these time - streams are then analyzed with our pipeline and the resulting angular power spectrum is compared to the power spectrum of the input sky signal to obtain the window function .",

    "as tabulated , the biggest contamination to sz detection comes from instrumental noise at the largest angular scales , while the firb dominates the contamination at the smallest angular scales probed by the experiment .",
    "radio point sources generate negligible confusion , primarily because at these high frequencies radio sources produce a weaker background compared to the dusty galaxies making the firb .",
    "in accounting for foreground contamination in the sz estimate , we have taken a conservative approach here allowing for all components . an aggressive approach with the assumption of no firb leads to a marginal detection of an sz signal especially in the third bin .",

    "we also fit jointly the combined wmap 5-year @xcite , acbar @xcite , and cbi @xcite data together with sz upper limits from and sza .",
    "we use the same analytical halo model with @xmath41 to include an extra uncertainty associated with non - gaussian covariance in each of these measurements ; these , however , make only a minor difference except in the case of bima where the smaller area surveyed increase the importance of non - gaussianities .",
    "marginalizing over all other cosmological parameters in the @xmath71cdm model , we find @xmath3 at 95% confidence level ( @xmath72 at 1@xmath1 ) .",
    "this sz derived amplitude is fully consistent with wmap 5-year result with @xmath73 @xcite . while it has been claimed in the past that the sz derived @xmath4 is higher than the value derived from the cmb , we do not find this is the case with the data .",
    "the next opportunities to perform a multi frequency analysis similar to ours will be with planck and olimpo @xcite .",
    "both these experiments include multiple bands at high frequencies where the sz is positive .",
    "as we have found that only one channel above the sz null frequency is not adequate to separate both cmb and firb from sz fluctuations , with several high frequency channels , these upcoming cmb experiments should be able to measure and separate firb more accurately than we were able to with just one channel at 350 ghz .",
