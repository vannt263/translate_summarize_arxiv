    "even though qcd yields a remarkably good description of the strong interaction , the low energy hadron physics has to be modelled phenomenologically .",
    "this is due to the fact that the usual perturbative approach in the coupling constant can not be applied to qcd below energies of the order of 1 gev .",
    "most of the phenomenological results were based on pcac and current algebra .",
    "however , in 1979 , weinberg @xcite showed how to reobtain many of these predictions by means of an effective lagrangian .",
    "the fields in that lagrangian are the light mesons , ( pions , kaons and etas ) which are understood as the goldstone bosons ( gb ) arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "the lagrangian is built as an expansion in derivatives , that respects the symmetry breaking pattern of qcd .",
    "indeed , the first term in the expansion is fixed by the symmetry requirements and accounts for the current algebra results",
    ". the next terms in the expansion produce further corrections , which depend on several phenomenological parameters but are always consistent with the qcd symmetry constraints .",
    "these techniques were later developed to one loop in a set of papers by gasser and leutwyler @xcite .",
    "they showed how to obtain amplitudes involving light mesons , as functions of their momenta , their masses and those few phenomenological parameters .    by fitting these parameters from a few low energy experiments it is then possible to obtain successful predictions for other processes",
    "the whole approach is known as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "very recently some partial higher order calculations @xcite have appeared in the literature as well as a complete two loop calculation of @xmath4 scattering @xcite , which will be needed in order to analyze new data to come from da@xmath8ne and brookhaven . for a general review of the available experimental data on pion physics and future prospects ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .    nevertheless , there are some intrinsic limitations when applying chpt , namely , the fact that the amplitudes calculated within the chiral approach are only unitary in the perturbative sense , that is , up to the next order in the external momenta .",
    "such a breakdown of unitarity is most severe at high energies , where the external momenta is no longer a good expansion parameter , although it can also occur at moderate energies @xcite . as a result ,",
    "it is not possible to reproduce resonant states , which are one of the most characteristic features of the strongly interacting regime .",
    "many different methods have been proposed in order to improve this behavior and thus to extend the applicability of chpt to higher energies ; among them : the use of pad approximants @xcite , the explicit introduction of resonances @xcite , the k - matrix @xcite , the large @xmath9 limit @xcite ( n being the number of gb ) or the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) @xcite .",
    "this work is devoted precisely to the last method , which can be justified within a dispersive approach and can easily reproduce the two lightest resonances : the @xmath2 in @xmath4 scattering @xcite and the @xmath10 in @xmath11 scattering @xcite .",
    "but not only that , the iam also improves considerably the fit to data even in non - resonant channels , almost up to the first two particle inelastic threshold ( the many particle inelastic thresholds can be neglected since they are suppressed by phase space factors ) .",
    "this fit provides a remarkably good parametrization that can be used for other processes . indeed , in a previous work @xcite",
    ", the authors showed how it can be used together with a simple unitarization prescription to obtain successful results on @xmath12 up to 700 mev .    of course",
    ", it is also possible to obtain very good parametrizations @xcite of @xmath4 or @xmath11 elastic scattering by including all resonant states explicitly .",
    "however , our aim choosing the iam is to reproduce these phenomena just with the few phenomenological parameters present in the chpt lagrangian . in this way , even though their masses and widths will not be obtained with great accuracy , resonances can be regarded as real predictions .",
    "that is one of the relevant features of the iam since other very popular unitarization methods are not able to reproduce resonances unless they are explicitly introduced in the calculation .",
    "that is , for instance , the case with the k - matrix .",
    "the purpose of this work is , first , to study how high in energies the iam yields good results and what are its limitations .",
    "we would also like to know whether it is possible to reproduce further resonance states .",
    "it is clear that the best candidates are the lightest resonances whose dominant decay modes are @xmath4 or @xmath11 .",
    "we have listed them in table 1 . in case",
    "these resonances were not accommodated after our unitarization , it would be interesting to understand why .",
    "second , once we have a good fit to these resonances , we want to make a complete numerical analysis of several low - energy quantities of interest , like the chiral parameters or the scattering lengths , including estimations for their errors . as we will see below , we expect that the iam somehow will include effects that can not be obtained from the pure @xmath13 expansion .",

    "data taken from @xcite .",
    "0.cm    finally , we would like to comment on another motivation of the present work , which at first may not seem very related to the main topic .",
    "the philosophy of the chiral approach has also reached the description of the strongly interacting symmetry breaking sector ( sisbs ) of the standard model @xcite .",
    "the scalar sector of such a model displays the same symmetry breaking pattern as two flavor massless qcd .",
    "hence it is possible to build an effective lagrangian , much as it is done for chpt @xcite .",
    "although the electroweak gb are not physical , using this lagrangian it is possible to obtain predictions for the scattering of longitudinal gauge bosons @xcite at future colliders , like the lhc . indeed , there are already experimental proposals to measure the electroweak chiral parameters at cms @xcite .",
    "most of the works on the sisbs make use of the equivalence theorem @xcite , which allows us to read the observable amplitudes , in terms of longitudinal gauge bosons , directly from those with gb . this theorem has been recently proved in the chiral lagrangian formalism @xcite and seems to be severely constrained by the lack of unitarity . at this point",
    "is when the unitarization procedures come into play and it is crucial to know whether they are reliable , since what we are now looking for are real predictions and not elaborated fits to still unavailable data .    in section 2",
    "we review some basic aspects of exact and perturbative unitarity and we define the partial waves in elastic scattering .",
    "section 3 introduces the iam , first with a derivation from dispersion theory and then by studying the constraints to its applicability .",
    "section 4 and section 5 are organized in the same way , although they refer to @xmath0 and @xmath1 chpt , respectively : first we apply the iam to chpt with the chiral parameters obtained from low energy experiments in order to study the iam predictive power .",
    "next , we present an iam fit to the data . for the best @xmath1 fit we present the unitarized results for the scattering lengths and some other phenomenological parameters .",
    "then , in section 6 , we study the analytic structure on the complex plane of the iam amplitudes . in section 7",
    "we present the conclusions .",
    "there is also an appendix where we give the elastic scattering formulae used in this work , as well as a discussion on perturbative unitarity .",
    "when dealing with strong interactions , it is usual to project the amplitudes in partial waves with definite angular momentum @xmath14 and isospin @xmath15 , as follows @xmath16 where @xmath17 or @xmath18 depending on whether the particles in the process are identical or not .",
    "the acceptable isospin values also depend on the process , namely @xmath19 for @xmath4 elastic scattering and @xmath20 for @xmath11 . for both reactions",
    "the definite isospin amplitudes @xmath21 are obtained from a single function . in the first case @xmath22",
    "whereas for @xmath11 scattering we can write @xmath23    in order to deal with both processes on the same footing , we will label the particles in the reaction as @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "thus the mandelstam variables will satisfy : @xmath26 and the threshold will be at @xmath27 .",
    "as it is well known , whenever @xmath28 , and below inelastic thresholds , the unitarity of the s - matrix implies @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the two particle phase space .",
    "explicitly : @xmath31 as a consequence of eq.[uni ] , the partial wave can be parametrized as follows : @xmath32 and @xmath33 is called the @xmath34 phase shift .",
    "we have already mentioned that the chpt amplitudes are obtained as an expansion in external momenta and masses .",
    "that is @xmath35 where , for the cases we are interested in , @xmath36 is @xmath37 , @xmath38 is @xmath39 , etc ... in practice , we can only obtain the few first terms of the series above and therefore the amplitude only satisfies the unitarity condition perturbatively @xmath40    the @xmath37 terms were given by weinberg @xcite and they are called the low energy theorems .",
    "the next order contributions to @xmath4 scattering were given in @xcite .",
    "the calculation for @xmath11 scattering can be found in @xcite , although we have found that the formulae in the literature do not satisfy eq.[punit ] .",
    "we will comment on that later .",
    "very recently it has appeared the complete calculation of the @xmath41 contribution to elastic @xmath4 scattering @xcite .",
    "although we will not use it , we will compare some of its results with those of our method .",
    "let us briefly review the standard derivation @xcite of the inverse amplitude method , since we will use it later in order to understand the applicability of the method .",
    "any partial wave obtained from a relativistic quantum field theory should present a characteristic analytic structure in the complex @xmath42 plane .",
    "indeed , the reaction threshold becomes a cut in the from @xmath43 to @xmath44 . due to crossing symmetry",
    ", there should be another left cut along the negative axis .",
    "if we now apply cauchy s theorem to our complex amplitudes we obtain integral equations known as dispersion relations .",
    "for instance , a three times subtracted dispersion relation is @xmath45 where we have not written explicitly the left cut ( lc ) contribution .",
    "the number of subtractions needed depends on how the amplitude behaves at infinity in order to ensure the vanishing of the contributions coming from closing the integral contour .",
    "we have chosen three subtractions since we are going to use @xmath39 chpt amplitudes which at high @xmath42 behave as @xmath46 .",
    "but our arguments remain valid for @xmath41 amplitudes when using four times subtracted dispersion relations , etc ...    the chpt partial waves present both cuts and we can calculate both the subtraction constants @xmath47 and the integrand inside eq.[disp ] _ perturbatively _ @xmath48 where we have expanded the subtraction constants in terms of @xmath49 .",
    "the iam is based on the fact that the function @xmath50 displays the very same analytic structure of @xmath51 , apart from some possible pole contributions . for later convenience",
    ", we will make use of @xmath52 .",
    "notice that we have multiplied @xmath53 by a real function without singularities ; thus we keep the same analytic structure and we can write a very similar dispersion relation : @xmath54 where @xmath55 stands for possible pole contributions .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath56 is that , using eqs.[uni ] and [ punit ] , we can calculate exactly the integral over the right cut ( but not on the left , since those equations only hold on the elastic cut ) , as follows : @xmath57 note that we are denote by @xmath51 the exact amplitude , which is unknown , although we know its analytic properties .",
    "in contrast , the expressions for @xmath36 and @xmath38 , etc ... have been calculated explicitly .    as we did before",
    ", we can also expand the @xmath58 subtraction coefficients in powers of @xmath59 , and then rewrite the dispersion relation for @xmath56 , which now reads @xmath60 where we have approximated @xmath61 on the left cut and we have neglected the pole contribution . in other words , @xmath62 this is the iam result that we are going to use in the present work .",
    "incidentally , eq.[iam ] can be understood as the formal @xmath63 $ ] pad approximant of the chpt amplitude .",
    "it is important to remark that if we expand again eq.[iam ] at low energies , we find @xmath64 that is , we recover the chpt expansion .",
    "hence , up to @xmath65 our method and chpt yield the same low energy results if the same chiral lagrangian parameters are used .",
    "let us review all the approximations made in the previous section , in order to comment how they will constraint the iam applicability :      in eq.[preiam ] we have replaced the @xmath56 left cut integral by that of @xmath66 . as we have remarked in the preceeding discussion , eqs.[uni ] and [ punit ] are only exact on the right cut",
    ". on the left cut we can not write the chain of equalities that lead to eq.[img ] . nevertheless , if we use the chpt result as an approximation : @xmath67 we get @xmath68 notice that , in order to obtain the @xmath34 phase shifts , we are going to calculate @xmath69 for real @xmath70 .",
    "that means that the denominator @xmath71 inside the integrals is never going to be very small , which somehow will wash out the error on the left cut .",
    "but note also that treating differently the right and left cuts violates crossing symmetry .",
    "indeed , in @xcite it has already been pointed out that the pad approximants do not reproduce correctly the subleading logarithms that would appear at _ next order _ in the chiral expansion ( @xmath65 in this case ) .",
    "of course they would be obtained if we applied the iam to the chiral amplitudes at @xmath65 , but still the method would not yield the correct logarithms at @xmath72 and so on . at high energies chiral logarithms are not so relevant , but at low energies they are a very important feature of chpt and indeed they can give the dominant contribution in some channels .",
    "nevertheless , from eq.[recover ] we see that at low energies the iam yields the very same @xmath73 chpt expansion , _ including _ the _ dominant _ chiral logarithms .",
    "the contribution from the left cut and subleading logarithms is @xmath65 . as a consequence ,",
    "if we try to make a low energy fit to the data , the parameters that we would obtain with the iam would not lie very far from those of chpt , but they will not be the same .",
    "that is the reason why , in the following sections , we will denote with a hat the parameters obtained from any iam fit .      in eq.[preiam ] , we have neglected the contributions coming from zeros in the amplitude , that will appear as poles of the inverse function .",
    "there is no way to know _ a priori _ whether or not a partial wave will vanish for a given value of @xmath42 , although it is known that chiral amplitudes have zeros below threshold , which are known as adler zeros .",
    "their position is not known except for the @xmath74 channel , where the pole is located at threshold . in our derivation",
    "it is compensated by the same zero in the @xmath75 channel .",
    "that is not the case of the @xmath76 amplitudes and therefore we are neglecting the contribution of their residue .",
    "consequently , our amplitudes are not valid to obtain adler zeros and that will affect our results at low energy ( but no more than @xmath65 ) .",
    "that is another reason to differentiate the parameters obtained from our fit from those of the pure chiral expansion .",
    "this is apparently a harmless assumption in the above reasoning , although it dramatically affects the results of the iam .",
    "in fact , it can happen that @xmath77 . in the @xmath78 channels of @xmath4 scattering or in the @xmath79 in @xmath11 , this only occurs for isolated values of @xmath42 , at or below threshold .",
    "in particular , that means that the iam amplitudes will have the same zeros as the lowest order chiral amplitudes . however , every other partial wave vanishes at @xmath37 , for any @xmath42 . as a consequence ,",
    "the formula in eq.[iam ] is no longer valid .",
    "nevertheless , we can generalize our previous derivation , in order to include those channels whose leading order is @xmath39 .",
    "we only have to go through the very same steps , although now we would write a dispersion relation for @xmath80 . but let us remember that the main improvement of the approach is that we are calculating exactly the integral of @xmath81 over the right cut .",
    "however , for that purpose we need an imaginary part , and by looking at eq.[punit ] we can see that @xmath77 implies that @xmath82 . therefore , unless we have a calculation up to @xmath83 , the corresponding imaginary part will vanish .",
    "hence when following the derivation of the iam if @xmath77 the best we can get is plain chpt again . at present , only @xmath84 calculations are available and we can only expect to obtain a real improvement with our approach in the six channels listed above .",
    "thus , we will not be able to reproduce the @xmath85 resonance .      in order to obtain @xmath86 on the right cut , eq.[img ] ,",
    "we have just made use of the elastic unitarity condition of eq.[uni ] .",
    "however , the right cut is composed of many superimposed cuts , each one corresponding to a different inelastic intermediate channel .",
    "actually , eq.[uni ] is only true below the first inelastic threshold , and the real unitarity condition reads @xmath87 the sum is over all the physically accessible intermediate states @xmath88 , whose phase space is @xmath89 .",
    "as far as we are neglecting electromagnetic interactions , the first inelastic channel in @xmath4 is the four pion intermediate state , at 550 mev .",
    "similarly , for @xmath11 is @xmath90 , whose threshold is @xmath91 910 mev . strictly speaking , only for lower energies the elastic approximation is exact .",
    "nevertheless , the contribution of these intermediate states is strongly suppressed by the four particle phase space and we expect the iam to provide a good approximation .    unfortunately within the range of energies we are interested in , there are intermediate channels which are not suppressed by phase space .",
    "indeed , at approximately @xmath92 mev the inelastic @xmath93 threshold opens up .",
    "its phase space factor is the @xmath89 in eq.[sigma ] , with @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , above the two kaon threshold we have to reconsider the derivation of the iam .",
    "let us illustrate with @xmath4 scattering how inelastic effects modify our result .",
    "as the starting point , for @xmath95 , we have a new unitarity relation : @xmath96 where we have denoted by @xmath97 the generic @xmath51 pion elastic scattering amplitude and by @xmath98 the @xmath34 partial wave of the process @xmath99 .",
    "thus we now have , for @xmath100 , that @xmath101 which differs from eq.[img ] in the term coming from two kaon intermediate production .",
    "if we follow the very same steps of our previous derivation , we arrive at @xmath102    notice that , using chpt , @xmath103 .",
    "but at these high energies that is not negligible .",
    "besides , we are interested in the above integral for physical values of @xmath42 and therefore the denominator will be almost divergent for some @xmath104 . for these reasons we can not neglect this integral and",
    "then we should not trust the iam since it could miss some relevant physical features .",
    "that is indeed the case in pion scattering since , as it can be seen in table 1 , there is one resonance , the @xmath105 , whose nature is closely related to the @xmath93 threshold .",
    "nowadays , the interpretation of that resonance is still controversial : different authors propose different poles ( not always just one ) in the vicinity of the @xmath93 inelastic cut @xcite .",
    "as we will see later , our approach is not able to reproduce any of these poles , consistent with the fact that the iam makes use just of elastic unitarity .    at this point",
    "we want to remark the importance of understanding why and when the method does no longer yield the right results .",
    "let us remember that we are also thinking in possible applications of this unitarization procedures to the electroweak chiral effective lagrangian , whose reference model is the standard model with a heavy higgs . in such case , one would expect to see a broad resonance in the scalar channel and we want to have a unitarization procedure whose predictions we can trust .      throughout the derivation of the iam we have been using the chiral amplitudes up to @xmath39 . nevertheless , it is possible to extend the argument to include higher order terms , as for instance the @xmath41 contributions . in that case",
    "we would have started from a four times subtracted dispersion relation for the two - loop calculation .",
    "once more , the integral over the right cut would be related to the one for @xmath52 .",
    "working out the expansion of the subtraction constants , we would then arrive to @xmath106 again that is the formal [ 1,2 ] pad approximant , and it satisfies the elastic unitarity condition .",
    "as we have already mentioned two recent papers have appeared with @xmath41 calculations of @xmath4 scattering within @xmath0 chpt @xcite .",
    "we have not used these results , since , as we have just seen , they will not help us to overcome any of the preceeding objections to the iam .",
    "however it is quite likely that , have we used them , the parameters of the fits that we will present in the next sections would had been slightly modified .",
    "the inverse amplitude method was first applied @xcite to @xmath4 scattering without the strange quark . in that case",
    ", the massless limit displays spontaneous symmetry breaking from @xmath107 to @xmath108 , which is nothing but the usual isospin . the @xmath39 expression for @xmath4 scattering",
    "was obtained in @xcite , and it is written in terms of four phenomenological parameters @xmath109 as well as the mass and pion decay constants , @xmath110 and @xmath111 . in this section",
    "we will review how the method is able to reproduce the @xmath112 resonance .",
    "we will show some results for recently proposed new parameters in order to test the iam predictive power , but we will also present a unitarized fit to the data . as a novelty we will use not only the @xmath76 phase shifts , but also those with @xmath113 , in order to obtain the best fit with the iam . in this new calculation ,",
    "we have also estimated the error bars of the unitarized parameters .",
    "let us now illustrate what happens if we apply the iam on the chpt amplitudes using the chiral parameters obtained from low energy experiments .",
    "we want to see quantitatively to what extent the main physical features are reproduced .    in order to simplify the comparison with previous works , we have chosen @xmath114 mev and @xmath115 mev .",
    "the values of the chiral parameters are not so clear , since they have considerable error bars . in table 2",
    "we have listed the different sets of parameters that we have taken from the literature to obtain fig.1 .

    "those in the first two lines come from @xmath120 decays @xcite .",
    "those in the third , from data on @xmath120 and @xmath4 together with some unitarization procedure ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath118 is calculated with the central values .",
    "let us remark at this point that for the chpt phase shifts we are using the definition @xmath121 suggested in @xcite .",
    "of course , chpt is just a low energy approach , but incidentally , these phase shifts coincide with those obtained from the k - matrix unitarization defined as @xmath122 it can be easily verified that @xmath123 satisfies elastic unitarity , eq.[uni ] , exactly .",
    "consequently , the dotted lines in fig.1 not only give the chpt predictions , but also the results of the k - matrix unitarization .",
    "we will thus confirm that such a method is not able to reproduce resonances by itself .",
    "they have to be added by hand .    in fig.1",
    "it can be clearly seen , in the @xmath74 channel , that the iam yields a @xmath112-like resonance .",
    "the value of its mass is obtained from the point where @xmath124 and it lies 10% to 15% away from its real value . in this way",
    ", the _ existence _ of the @xmath112 resonance can be regarded as a prediction of the iam with chpt and the parameters obtained from some low energy data .",
    "it is also evident that the fit of the @xmath125 channel is correct up to much higher energies . in table 2",
    "we have also included the values of @xmath118 corresponding to each choice of parameters .",
    "for all the cases we have set @xmath126 and @xmath127 following reference @xcite .",
    "the only feature of @xmath4 scattering that is evidently missing from the unitarized results is the @xmath105 resonance in the @xmath128 channel . in the previous section",
    "we saw that this fact is connected with the failure of the whole approach to reproduce the kaon inelastic cut . but let us first obtain a better fit to the data .",
    "now that we have an amplitude that describes the right cut , while keeping at the same time the correct polynomial form from chpt , it seems natural to use @xmath118 @xcite to fit the data .",
    "note that fixing the correct mass does not imply a good fit .",
    "-2 cm    0.cm 0.cm    for instance , we could get a wrong width . in order to differentiate the parameters thus obtained from those coming from plain chpt",
    "we will call them @xmath129 .",
    "the ( 1,1 ) channel is almost only sensible to @xmath130 . with @xmath131",
    "we get the @xmath118 listed in table 1 and in fig .",
    "2 it can be seen that the results are remarkably successful .",
    "later we will show that we also get the right width .",
    "once that difference is fixed , we just have to determine one parameter , say @xmath132 . in previous studies @xcite the unitarized fit to the other phase shifts",
    "was used in order to estimate the values of @xmath133 and @xmath132 .",
    "but , as we commented above , the data in the ( 0,0 ) channel is not as good as that of ( 1,1 ) .",
    "the same happens for the ( 2,0 ) channel , where the curves are not very sensible to small variations in the @xmath134 parameters .",
    "therefore , in the present work , we have also used the @xmath113 channels ( mainly that with @xmath135 ) to further constrain the parameter range .",
    "let us remember now that in these channels @xmath136 and , as we have already discussed in section 2 , the iam leads again to plain chpt .",
    "that is why we will only use for them data up to @xmath137mev , although in other channels we are using data at higher energies .",
    "thus , the values given in table 3 are just a conservative estimate of the range where we obtain a reasonable fit in the @xmath138 and @xmath139 channels , when @xmath118 fixed to its actual value .",
    "the results are shown in fig.2 , where the continuous line corresponds to the central @xmath134 values and the shaded area to their uncertainties .",
    "notice that the shaded area has always been obtained by varying @xmath132 within its estimated error .",
    "in fig.2 it can be seen how it is not possible to fit the @xmath105 resonance with @xmath0 chpt and the iam .",
    "it is clear that , even though the actual value of the @xmath140 phase shift may not lie very far from the unitarized prediction , the qualitative behavior of the curves in this channel is not correct above @xmath141mev .    with the @xmath134 fit we can obtain the total breit - wigner width of the @xmath112 resonance from : @xmath142 indeed we have computed it for different values of @xmath42 around @xmath143 . the result is given in table.3 and it is quite close to the experimental result ( see table 1 ) although slightly high .",
    "we will see that it is possible to obtain the right value when using @xmath1 chpt .",
    "as we have already commented , this result is not at all trivial , since fitting the right mass does not ensure a correct description of the resonance . therefore , even though we are now using the @xmath118 experimental value , the @xmath144 width is again a prediction of the iam .",

    "thus there are as many unitarization techniques as algebraic tricks to implement such a constraint exactly or to get a better approximation .",
    "however , we have already seen in section 3.1 that , below any other inelastic threshold , the inverse amplitude method can be derived directly from the analytic structure of the general two body elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "our purpose in this section is to show that , apart from satisfying elastic unitarity , it provides the correct analytic structure required from relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "such an structure is not trivial at all and can not be reproduced by other unitarization procedures .",
    "both the left and right unitarity cuts are already present in plain chpt , therefore , we will mainly focus on the poles in the second riemann sheet .    in the previous section we used the most naive criteria to identify resonances , i.e. , that the phase crosses the @xmath124 value .",
    "however , that is only true for the simplest cases .",
    "the rigorous characterization of resonances is made in terms of poles in the second riemann sheet of the amplitudes in the @xmath42 complex plane .",
    "indeed , when a resonance is produced by just one of these poles , both its mass and width are related to the pole position by @xmath225 provided the width is small enough .    in this work",
    "we have extended to the @xmath42 complex plane both the @xmath4 and the @xmath11 elastic scattering iam amplitudes obtained in the previous section .",
    "notice that the cuts in chpt come from logarithmic functions , so that we have infinite sheets in the complex plane .",
    "however , only two of them correspond to the first and second riemann sheets .",
    "once we have identified these sheets we can check whether the resonances that we found in previous sections are produced by a pole in the second riemann sheet and thus whether they have a real sound basis .    -2",
    "cm    0.cm 0.cm    we will first analyze the @xmath226 process . in figure 6",
    "we represent the imaginary part of the amplitude in the complex @xmath42 plane for the three channels @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "notice that when we say complex @xmath42 plane , we mean that we have parametrized @xmath42 as @xmath229 , where @xmath230 is the cm energy and is represented in the real axis whereas @xmath231 provides the complex part . on the left column",
    "we have displayed the results in the first riemann sheet , whereas in the right column we have continued through the cut to the lower half of the second riemann sheet . in all cases",
    "it can be clearly noticed the existence of a cut on the real axis on the first riemann sheet . as we had commented before , a right cut is not anything completely new , since it is already present in one - loop chpt , although in that case , the values that the amplitudes take on it are different .",
    "in contrast , the most striking new feature in the iam amplitudes is the appearance of poles in the second riemann sheet and how they determine the amplitude shape for the physical values of @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , we have found two poles with @xmath232 in the second riemann sheet , one in the @xmath233 partial wave and another one in @xmath234 .",
    "let us start with the second , which clearly corresponds to the @xmath112 resonance .",
    "the position of this pole can be obtained from the contour plots in fig.7 , and it is found at around @xmath235 . using eq.[respar ]",
    "we see that it is in a good agreement with the @xmath2 mass and width parameters given in table 1 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that this pole is completely consistent with the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "the other pole that can be seen in @xmath226 is on the @xmath233 channel . using the parameters of the best @xmath1 iam fit of the previous section , we find that it is located at @xmath236 .",
    "it is not responsible for the appearance of any resonance , since it is very far away from the real axis .",
    "however , from purely phenomenological fits to pion scattering data it had already been pointed out the existence of such a pole around @xmath237 mev @xcite .",
    "this pole is responsible for the strong interaction in that dominates the at low energy the two pion @xmath233 channel .",
    "we can now see that even in the channel where there is not an apparent improvement , the iam yields the correct analytic structure .",
    "-2 cm    0.cm 0.cm    much as it happened in previous sections , the method is not able to reproduce the @xmath105 resonance . as we already commented , the interpretation in terms of poles of this resonance is still controversial .",
    "following the same steps as before , we have also identified the four riemann sheets that now appear due to the superposition of two cuts .",
    "indeed , we have even implemented the iam derived with the inelastic unitarity condition in section 3.2.4 .",
    "we have not found any pole that could hint at the existence of such a resonance .    -2",
    "cm    0.cm 0.cm    as we have already explained , we should not expect to find anything since the approach is not able to reproduce properly the two kaon unitarity cut and consequently neither its associated sheet structure .",
    "let us now address to the @xmath11 elastic scattering case .",
    "again , in fig.8 we have displayed the imaginary part of the amplitudes for the @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "those pictures on the left represent the first riemann sheet and those on the right , the second .",
    "once more the existence of a unitarity cut is clear , but there is also the appearance of a pole in the appropriate channel . in particular , using the third contour plot of fig.7 , we have found a pole in @xmath240 mev , which using eq.[respar ] yields again the mass and width for the @xmath10 resonance that we gave in table 5 .",
    "in this work we have shown how the iam provides a consistent technique to accommodate resonances .",
    "indeed , based on its derivation from dispersion theory , we have made a systematic analysis of its applicability , which is mainly limited by the existence of two body inelastic thresholds and by the fact that the tree level approximation vanishes in some channels .",
    "we have found that it is able to predict the most relevant features of strong elastic scattering , once the chiral parameters are determined from low energy data .",
    "quantitatively , the errors are hard to estimate , but we have found in all cases that the mass of the predicted resonances fall within approximately 15% of their actual values .",
    "we think this fact gives a sound basis for its application in order to obtain at least a qualitative description of resonances in the strongly interacting symmetry breaking sector .",
    "moreover , once we force the iam results to fit the actual resonance mass values , we get a remarkably good fit which is able to reproduce the experimental data up to the next relevant two body inelastic threshold . following that procedure ,",
    "we have given the unitarized @xmath0 chpt fit to @xmath241 as well as that of @xmath1 to @xmath4 and @xmath11 elastic scattering .",
    "for the first time we have estimated the values of the unitarized chiral parameters together with their error bars .",
    "these values do not lie very far from those obtained without the iam , and therefore do not spoil the low energy expansion , as can be noticed from the scattering lengths that we have given .    with this fit , we have calculated several low - energy phenomenological parameters , like the scattering lengths .",
    "our values differ from those obtained at @xmath39 due to the unitarization",
    ". however we expect that they include other corrections due to unitarity and resonant effects .",
    "we consider that it would not make any sense to try to reduce the error bars in the unitarized parameters within this approach .",
    "one has to keep in mind that we have neglected higher order chpt corrections , isospin - breaking contributions , and that we have used high energy data which is very sensible to such effects .",
    "it is quite likely that , in order to obtain results consistent to a higher degree of accuracy , the iam in the simple version that has been used here , will not be enough .",
    "finally we have also shown how the iam yields the proper analytic structure in the complex @xmath42 plane , in contrast with other unitarization techniques .",
    "indeed , we have found that the apparent resonant behavior that is observed on phase shifts , is produced by the corresponding poles in the second riemann sheet , meeting the strict requirements imposed by general relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "therefore , we think that the iam and unitarization by means of dispersion theory is the most natural and economic way to extend the applicability of chiral lagrangians .",
    "we have seen however , that its main limitations come from the existence of two body inelastic thresholds .",
    "nevertheless , work is still in progress in the subject , the iam has been recently applied to other processes and higher order chpt calculations will be soon available .",
    "as far as some other physically relevant features do not lie very far from the present applicability limits , it seems very likely that they can be reproduced in the near future .",

    "the first calculation of elastic @xmath11 scattering was later performed in @xcite .",
    "these amplitudes were given in terms of physical as well as _",
    "lowest order _ masses and decay constants , which are usually denoted by @xmath243 and @xmath244 , respectively ( @xmath245 being either @xmath246 or @xmath247 ) .",
    "of course , the only measurable parameters are the first , and when comparing with experimental observations , one has to eliminate those from _",
    "lowest order _ in terms of the physical constants .    indeed , it is possible to find @xcite the relation between @xmath248 and @xmath110 as well as that between @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "unfortunately , at _ lowest order _ there is only one @xmath251 , which is related both to @xmath111 and @xmath252 .",
    "hence , whenever one finds @xmath251 in an expression there are two choices : either relate it to @xmath111 or to @xmath252 .",
    "the difference between the two choices will be one order higher in the chiral expansion .",
    "for instance , if one has an @xmath37 expression with @xmath253 , in principle one can substitute it by @xmath254 or @xmath255 .",
    "all these choices are equally acceptable .",
    "when one is working only with pions , the natural choice is the one that leaves all the expressions in terms of @xmath111 .",
    "when one is dealing both with pions and kaons , it is not so obvious .",
    "however , once one choice is done for the @xmath256 term , we have to keep it for the @xmath73 contribution , otherwise one would violate perturbative unitarity , eq.[uni ] .",
    "surprisingly , in the amplitude in the literature @xcite , which is the one we had also followed in our previous work @xcite , the choice for the @xmath256 term is different from that of the @xmath73 contribution that yields the imaginary part .",
    "indeed , the @xmath256 term is written just in terms of @xmath111 whereas @xmath257 is written in terms of @xmath111 and @xmath252 . as a consequence ,",
    "there is a @xmath258 factor of difference between @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "numerically that amounts to a @xmath261 factor .",
    "thus , we have rederived from the original work @xcite the amplitudes in terms of physical quantities , ( also correcting some small errata ) so that they satisfy perturbative unitarity .",
    "we have chosen to write the formulae symmetrically with respect to @xmath111 and @xmath252 .",
    "but the other choices are equally acceptable .",
