    "also the equiaffine immersions , in the sense of blaschke for hypersurfaces , and in the sense of @xcite or @xcite for higher codimensions provide examples of affine immersions .    for an affine immersion it is possible to introduce a bilinear form @xmath15 , called the second fundamental form , which takes values in the tranversal bundle @xmath14 by @xmath16 since @xmath4 is a torsion free affine connection , @xmath15 is symmetric in @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "a general classification of the euclidean parallel submanifolds was obtained in @xcite .",
    "as far as we know it is still an open problem to classify the semi - euclidean parallel submanifolds .    in this paper",
