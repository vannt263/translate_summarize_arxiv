    "the orbifold - pair @xmath958 is acylindrical .",
    "it suffices to prove acylindricity for the 2-fold cover @xmath932 of @xmath958 .",

    "thus , @xmath958 is acylindrical .",
    "we now conclude that the sub - orbifolds @xmath967 and @xmath968 are maximal ( up to isotopy ) @xmath826-bundles in @xmath888 .",

    "irreducibility of @xmath888 follows from the fact that each annulus and moebius band @xmath969 is incompressible in @xmath888 ( as it is incompressible in the pieces of the jsj decomposition ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath888 contains no bad suborbifolds .",
    "atoroidality of @xmath888 follows since each essential torus in @xmath888 has to be contained in one of the characteristic suborbifolds and they are all strongly atoroidal .",
