    "what happens next depends on the subsequent evolution of @xmath3 .",
    "when inflation ends , the hubble horizon begins to grow linearly in time , but the wavelength stretches more slowly , as @xmath4 . if the vacuum energy is zero , this situation will persist indefinitely , and the hubble horizon eventually catches up with the perturbation ( see the left panel of fig .",

    "a part of the global spacetime is permanently inaccessible to any given observer , and the evolution of perturbations is very different .",
    "depending on when they were produced , inflationary fluctuations may or may not re - enter the hubble horizon during matter domination ( see the right panel of fig . [ wave ] ) .",
    "if they do not re - enter by the time the universe begins to accelerate , they will never do so and hence will never be directly observable .    the photons which comprise the cmb",
    "originate on the slice ( i.e. a sphere ) of the last scattering surface which is separated from the observer by null geodesics ( labelled pt in fig .",
    "[ wave ] ) . in a decelerating universe",
    "the radius of this last scattering sphere grows without bound , and new information about inflation continues to become available over time .    in a universe which accelerates , the last - scattering sphere asymptotes to the size of the event horizon at the time of last scattering , which is finite .",
    "therefore , the pattern of temperature anisotropies in the cmb  freezes \" after the transition to future acceleration .    eventually even this remnant will be permanently erased .",
    "spacetimes with event horizons contain hawking particles , and as the cosmological expansion continues , the cmb redshifts until it is colder than the hawking radiation .",

    "the condition that an initial hubble - scale perturbation ( generated at some time @xmath5 during inflation with scale @xmath6 ) has expanded to fill the observable universe today ( subscript @xmath7 refers to now ) is : @xmath8 using @xmath9 for times during inflation yields @xmath10 for some time @xmath11 during inflation .",
    "after inflation , the universe grew by a factor of about @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the reheating temperature and @xmath14 the current cmb temperature . taking this ratio to be about @xmath15 and the scale of inflation to be @xmath16",

    "hence , to use inflation to solve the horizon and flatness problems requires at least @xmath18 efolds ( this is somewhat model dependent ) .     for a universe which inflates , followed by radiation and matter domination ; on the right , the same quantity for a universe that enters a late - time accelerating phase .",

    "this spectrum does not redshift in the usual way .",

    "<S> i present a brief review of astro - ph/0406099 , which argues that there is a limit on the number of efolds of inflation which are _ observable _ in a universe which undergoes an eternally accelerated expansion in the future . </S>",
    "<S> such an acceleration can arise from an equation of state @xmath0 , with @xmath1 , and it implies the existence of event horizons . in some respects the future acceleration acts as a second period of inflation , and  initial perturbations \" ( including signatures of the first inflationary period ) are inflated away or thermalize with the ambient hawking radiation . thus the current cmb data may be looking as far back in the history of the universe as will ever be possible even in principle , making our era a most opportune time to study cosmology . </S>"
