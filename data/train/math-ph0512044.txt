    "such uncorrelated random processes may seem unsuitable for describing correlated phenomena in nature .",
    "lvy - based modelling , however , accomplishes exactly that .",
    "it does so by making use of overlapping sums of dice as follows : suppose we have three dice labeled @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 whose outcomes are uncorrelated .",
    "the two variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 will nevertheless be correlated since @xmath6 and @xmath7 share the outcome of die @xmath2 .",
    "this simple example can be generalised to construct correlated processes in spacetime .",
    "let , for example , the energy @xmath8 at a point @xmath9 be determined by the sum of outcomes of all dice occurring within its _ ambit set _ , a kind of causality cone similar to einstein s familiar light cone ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "as shown in figure 2 , two energies at different points will then be correlated if their respective ambit sets overlap , because they will share a common ancestry to some extent . the freedom to choose both the kind of randomness and the form and size of the ambit set permits this approach to mimic different types of correlated behaviour .",
    "this article deals with the particular class of phenomena called multifractal and multiscaling , which includes turbulence , data traffic flows , cloud distributions , rain fields and tumour profiles , to name but a few .",
    "all of these show a power - law - like behaviour in their correlations which are easily incorporated into the lvy - based modelling scheme by taking _",
    "products _ of random variables rather than their sums .",
    "we show how to construct both the kind of randomness ( the lvy basis ) and suitable ambit sets for this class , taking as input the measured correlations , and calculate analytically correlations for overlaps of various kinds ( see figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "while this paper concerns itself chiefly with multifractals , the lvy scheme as such is much more general and can be appled to many other correlated random processes . *",

    "multifractality @xcite has in the last decade become one of a number of well - established approaches to the analysis of time series and spatial patterns , whether nonlinear , random , deterministic , or chaotic .",
    "it serves , for example , to characterize the intermittent fluctuations observed in fully developed turbulent flows @xcite and in data traffic flows of communication networks @xcite .",
    "spatial patterns of cloud distributions and rain fields @xcite reveal multifractal properties , as do super - rough tumor profiles @xcite . while still controversial , multiscaling has also been applied to financial time series of exchange rates and stock indices @xcite .",
    "many other examples may be found in the literature .",
    "multifractality should not , however , be seen as a mere tool for analysis and characterization : it has also found its way into theoretical modeling .",
    "maybe the simplest construction of a multifractal field is achieved with random multiplicative cascade processes @xcite which introduce a hierarchy of scales and multiplicatively redistribute a flux density from large to small scales .",
    "various generalizations of such purely spatial and discrete cascade processes towards continuous cascade processes in time and/or space , formulated in terms of integrals over an uncorrelated noise field , have been undertaken recently . a purely temporal and causal generalization to a continuous cascade process",
    "is , for example , discussed by schmitt @xcite , who introduces a log - normal field , itself defined as an integral of a weighted and uncorrelated noise field over an associated time - dependent interval . by judicious choice of integration interval and weight function ,",
    "the resulting process is stationary and exhibits approximate scaling behaviour of two - point correlations .",
    "muzy and bacry @xcite discuss a similar approach , constructing a purely temporal multifractal measure with the help of a limiting process .",
    "since , however , the field amplitude depends on times later than the observation time @xmath10 , the model does not obey causality .",
    "the proper description and modeling of spatio - temporal multifractal physical processes clearly calls for a model generalization that is causal , explicitly depends on space and time and does so in a continuous framework . a first step in this direction",
    "was achieved in @xcite , where a continuous and causal spatio - temporal process was constructed in analogy to a discrete cascade process .",
    "analytical forms for two- and three - point correlations for the case of a stable noise field were successfully compared to the corresponding experimental statistics in fully developed turbulent shear flow .",
    "the aim of the work presented here is to provide a general framework for the construction of spatio - temporal processes that permits a unified description of the above - mentioned models @xcite while transcending them all .",
    "the basic notion in this framework is that of independently scattered random measures of lvy type .",
    "the appealing mathematics behind these measures , as described in @xcite ( with emphasis on spatio - temporal modeling ) , provide a characterisation of arbitrary @xmath0-point correlations independent of the choice of a concrete realisation of the model .",
    "this opens up the possibility of designing spatio - temporal processes almost to order , i.e.  satisfying prescribed correlations .    as an application , we present the construction of a multiscaling and causal spatio - temporal process that is based on and derived from scaling two - point correlations .",
    "in contrast to @xcite and @xcite , where the specification of the probability density of the noise - field must be included from the very beginning , we can construct the process without fixing the marginal distribution of the field - amplitude .",
    "this opens up the possibility of tailoring the marginal distribution of the process to the phenomenology of a given application .",
    "in particular , the special case of a stable law coincides with @xcite .",
    "while we will concentrate on multifractal examples in most of this paper , it should be noted that this framework is not restricted to multiscaling ( defined as scaling of correlation functions ) or multifractal processes ( defined as scaling of the coarse - grained process ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : genmod ] , we discuss the general framework for spatio - temporal modeling and derive an explicit expression for @xmath0-point correlation functions for the general set - up . based on this result , we turn to the application in the context of causal and multiscaling spatio - temporal processes in section [ sec : multiscal ] , where we show in detail the multiscaling properties of temporal and spatial @xmath0-point correlations of arbitrary order and",
    "establish a relation between spatio - temporal multiscaling and spatio - temporal multifractality .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] concludes the paper with a summary and a brief outlook .",
    "the aim of this section is to define the general framework and to provide useful mathematics for the construction of a class of causal spatio - temporal processes that are based on the integration of an independently scattered random measure of lvy type .",
    "the integral constituting a given observable extends over a finite domain in space - time , called the _ ambit set _ @xmath11 .",
    "this approach includes the special case of a continuous cascade process in space and/or time as an example . in particular , we recover the temporal cascade processes discussed in @xcite and @xcite , as well as the spatio - temporal cascade process derived in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we restrict ourselves to causal processes in @xmath12 dimensions only , referring the reader to @xcite and @xcite for the general case of @xmath13-dimensional processes and its various applications and properties .",
    "the basic notion is that of an _ independently scattered random measure _",
    "( i.s.r.m ) on continous space - time , @xmath14 . loosely speaking , the measure associates a random number with any subset of @xmath15 . whenever two subsets are disjoint , the associated measures are independent , and the measure of a disjoint union of sets almost certainly equals the sum of the measures of the individual sets . for a mathematically more rigorous definition of i.s.r.m.s and their theory of integration , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "independently scattered random measures provide a natural basis for describing uncorrelated noise processes in space and time .",
    "a special class of i.s.r.m.s is that of homogeneous lvy bases , where the distribution of the measure of each set is infinitely divisible and does not depend on the location of the subset . in this case , it is easy to handle integrals with respect to the lvy basis using the well - known lvy - khintchine and lvy - ito representations for lvy processes .",
    "here , we state the result and point to @xcite for greater detail and rigour .",
    "let @xmath16 be a homogeneous lvy basis on @xmath17 , i.e.  @xmath18 is infinitely divisible for any @xmath19 .",
    "then we have the fundamental relation @xmath20\\mathrm{d}a \\right \\ } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 denotes the expectation , @xmath22 is any integrable deterministic function , and @xmath23 denotes the cumulant function of @xmath24 , defined by @xmath25\\,\\mathrm{d}a.\\ ] ] the usefulness of ( [ fund ] ) is obvious : it permits explicit calculation of the correlation function of the integrated and @xmath22-weighted noise field @xmath24 once the cumulant function @xmath23 of @xmath22 is known .",
    "based on relation ( [ fund ] ) , we construct a spatio - temporal process that is causal and continuous for a continuous range of points @xmath9 .",
    "] by defining the observable field @xmath26 as @xmath27 this is clearly a multiplicative process of independent factors @xmath28 made up of a specifiable _ weight function _ @xmath22 and a homogeneous lvy basis @xmath16 over @xmath17 . contributions to field amplitude @xmath26 lie within the influence domain @xmath29 , called the associated ambit set . to guarantee causality",
    ", we demand that @xmath11 be nonzero only for times preceding the observation time @xmath10 , i.e.  @xmath30 $ ] ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "ansatz ( [ def ] ) reduces to the model of ref .",
    "@xcite when focusing on one purely temporal dimension , setting @xmath31 $ ] , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and defining @xmath16 to be brownian motion .",
    "similarly , a non - causal and again purely temporal version of the general model ( [ def ] ) with a conical ambit set leads with a scale label and omitting the causality condition . ] to the scale - dependent measures used in @xcite .    as shown in the appendix and discussed in section [ sec : linkmult ] , our approach also includes the case of a multifractal measure that is constructed without a limit - argument .",
    "moreover , it allows for multifractality in space and time simultaneously .",
    "this multifractal case ( with the additional assumption of a stable lvy basis ) corresponds to the log - stable process described in @xcite , where the ambit set is constructed from an analogy to a cascade process . in section",
    "[ sec : constr ] , we derive the same result from an alternative approach .",
    "some other applications of ( [ def ] ) are discussed in @xcite .    the generality of the model ( [ def ] )",
    "is based on the possibility of choosing the constituents of the process @xmath26 independently .",
    "the available degrees of freedom are the weight function @xmath22 , an arbitrary infinitely divisible distribution for the lvy basis @xmath16 ( including brownian motion , stable processes , self - decomposable processes etc . ) and the shape of the ambit set @xmath11 . as all of these quantities can be chosen to fit the purpose and application in mind , our ansatz permits sensitive and flexible modeling of the correlation structure of @xmath26 . despite its generality , the model is tractable enough to yield explicit expressions for arbitrary @xmath0-point correlations in closed form .",
    "the definition of the process @xmath26 allows for an explicit calculation of arbitrary spatio - temporal @xmath0-point correlations , defined as @xmath34 which give a complete characterisation of the correlation structure of @xmath26 .    using the definition ( [ def ] ) and the fundamental relation ( [ fund ] ) we rewrite @xmath35 \\mathrm{d}x'\\mathrm{d}t'\\right \\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we made use of the index - function @xmath36 for sets @xmath37 .",
    "the last step in ( [ cn ] ) follows from the fundamental equation ( [ fund ] ) .    to illustrate ( [ cn ] )",
    ", we consider in more detail the cases @xmath38 and @xmath39 with the abbreviation @xmath40 .",

    "the latter factor describes the correlation of the field amplitude @xmath44 at different spatio - temporal locations ; for locations where the overlap @xmath45 vanishes , we get uncorrelated field amplitudes @xmath46 .",
