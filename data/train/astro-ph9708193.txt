    "the spin evolution of an accreting magnetic star , an x - ray pulsar , magnetic cv , or t tauri star , is thought to be regulated by torques acting between the accretion disk and the stellar magnetosphere ( rappaport & joss 1977 ; warner 1990 ; konigl 1991 ) .",
    "because of the small neutron star moment of inertia , however , only the x - ray pulsars undergo accretion - induced changes in rotation frequency large enough to measured on short time scales ( @xmath3 days ) .",
    "they are thus ideal laboratories for studying the dynamical interaction between a magnetic star and its accretion disk .",
    "accreting x - ray pulsars are rotating , highly magnetized ( @xmath4 g ) neutron stars that accrete material from a stellar companion , either from a stellar wind , or by roche - lobe overflow mediated by an accretion disk .",
    "disks may also form in wind - fed systems if the captured material has sufficient angular momentum to circularize before reaching the neutron star magnetosphere ( see king 1995 ) .",
    "the strong magnetic field disrupts the disk and forces the accreting plasma to corotate with the star at a radius where magnetic and fluid stresses roughly balance , @xmath5 cm , where @xmath6 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath7 is the magnetic dipole moment , and @xmath8 is the mass of the neutron star . although the coupling between the disk and magnetosphere is complicated , and may depend on the geometry and relative orientation of the magnetic field ( wang 1997 ) , in the simplest picture of accretion torque ( pringle & rees 1972 ; rappaport & joss 1977 ) one assumes that the specific angular momentum of material captured from the inner accretion disk is somehow transported onto the star with the accreting matter . for a keplerian disk ,",
    "the pulsar will experience a spin - up torque @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the pulsar spin frequency , and @xmath11 is the neutron - star moment of inertia .",
    "early observations indicated that , on average , most accreting pulsars were spinning up on a time scale @xmath12 yrs consistent with equation ( [ eq : torque ] ) .",
    "this was strong evidence that x - ray pulsars must be compact stars with large magnetospheric radii ( rappaport & joss 1977 ) .",
    "this simple spin - up picture had to be modified when two well - studied pulsars , her x-1 and cen x-3 , were found to be spinning up much more slowly than predicted by equation ( [ eq : torque ] ) .",
    "furthermore , these pulsars sometimes underwent short episodes of spin - down ( elsner & lamb 1977 ; ghosh & lamb 1979 ) .",
    "how could a star capturing material from a disk with the same sense of rotation actually lose angular momentum while continuing to accrete ?    to explain this behavior ghosh and lamb ( 1979 ; hereafter gl ) argued that the spin - up accretion torque must decrease  and eventually become negative  when the stellar rotation frequency approaches the keplerian orbital frequency of the inner accretion disk , @xmath13 .",
    "since most x - ray pulsars are in binaries much older than the pulsar spin - up time scale , gl argued they should have reached this near - equilibrium state . in this situation , magnetic field lines which thread the disk beyond the corotation radius ( where the disk rotates more slowly than the star ) are swept back in a trailing spiral and transport angular momentum outward .",
    "stars close to equilibrium will spin up much more slowly than predicted by equation ( [ eq : torque ] ) and can even spin down while continuing to accrete .",
    "gl wrote their torque as a modified form of equation ( [ eq : torque ] ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a dimensionless function of the `` fastness parameter '' , @xmath16 . for most observations",
    "@xmath17 can be taken as constant , so that , in their theory , observed torque fluctuations mainly reflect the dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath6 although several functional form has been suggested ( e.g. campbell 1987 ; wang 1987 , 1995 , 1997 ) , for our discussion it is only important that @xmath18 is a smooth and monotonically increasing function of @xmath6 that crosses zero at some @xmath19 corresponding to a critical fastness parameter @xmath20",
    ". an approximate version of @xmath21 with @xmath22 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "in particular , the spin - up torque becomes negative at low accretion rates ; the magnetospheric radius @xmath23 moves outwards , close enough to the corotation radius @xmath24 that the negative magnetic torques become large .",
    "note , however , that sudden changes in accretion torque require sudden changes in @xmath6 .",
    "prior to 1991 , the spin periods of accreting pulsars were typically measured only once or twice per year by pointed x - ray telescopes ( nagase 1989 and references therein ) .",
    "consequently , published measurements of accretion torque were usually long - term averages .",
    "since the launch of the compton gamma ray observatory in april 1991 , however , the batse instrument has compiled the first continuous long - term history of pulse frequencies for the majority of persistent x - ray pulsars ( bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ) , increasing the sampling of pulse periods by more than a factor of 100 .",
    "the frequency history of the 4.8s pulsar cen x-3 shown in figure [ fig : fig2 ] is one example where batse observations reveal a strikingly different picture of pulsar spin behavior than previously understood .",
    "prior to batse , the long - term frequency history had been described as secular spin - up at @xmath25hzs@xmath26  a factor of @xmath35 slower than predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq : torque ]  superposed with wavy fluctuations and short episodes of spin down .",
    "this behavior was interpreted as evidence that cen x-3 was rotating near its equilibrium spin period with a significantly reduced torque ( elsner & lamb 1977 ) .",
    "in contrast , the more frequently sampled batse data show that cen x-3 actually exhibits frequent transitions between states of steady spin up and spin down , with a short - term torque magnitude consistent with equation  [ eq : torque ] . the bimodal torque behavior has been confirmed quantitatively ( finger , wilson & fishman 1994 ) .",
    "the pulsar is nearly always in one of two possible torque states ( @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) and remains in one state for @xmath29 days before switching to the other .",
    "transitions between spin up and spin down occur on a time scale more rapid than batse can resolve , @xmath3010d .",
    "it is now evident that the reduced long - term spin - up torque inferred from the sparse pre - batse data is a consequence of these frequent transitions between spin up and spin down ( prince et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "interestingly , torque transitions like those seen in cen x-3 appear to be common : at least 4 out of the 8 persistent pulsars observed by batse show torque reversals between steady spin - up and steady spin - down . of the remaining four , three ( gx 3012 , vela x-1 and 4u 1538 - 52 ) are wind - fed pulsars while her x-1 is sampled infrequently at 35 day intervals so that we can not measure its torque on short time scales .",
    "one of the most dramatic torque transitions took place in the @xmath31s pulsar 4u 1626 - 67 around 1991 ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "after two decades of the smoothest spin up observed in any accreting pulsar , batse found that 4u1626 - 67 was smoothly spinning down .",
    "most surprisingly , the spin down torque is nearly equal in magnitude , but opposite in sign , to the spin up torque .",
    "a similar transition to spin down was observed in the 120s pulsar gx 1 + 4 in 1988 ( makishima et al .",
    "1988 ) after more than a decade of steady spin up .",
    "again , the spin down rate is close in magnitude to the spin up rate .",
    "finally , the 38s disk - fed pulsar oao  1657415 shows torque episodes with strength and duration very close to those seen in cen x-3 ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "to explain the batse observations , the near - equilibrium models described above require the disks in systems like cen x-3 to somehow undergo repeated step - function - like changes in the mass accretion rate ( figure 1 ) .",
    "moreover , these transitions in @xmath6 must always produce torques of opposite signs , but with similar magnitudes .",
    "indeed , the hypothesized change in accretion rate in 4u 1626 - 67 must result in a spin - down torque within @xmath32 of its previous spin - up rate . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cycle of transitions reflects physics occurring at the boundary between the disk and the magnetosphere , then one would expect the characteristic time between transitions to range between the dynamical time scale , @xmath33s , and the inner disk viscous time scale , @xmath34 s , where @xmath35 is the disk thickness . yet",
    "systems like gx 1 + 4 and 4u 1626 - 67 were stable for years before reversing their torques .    when the transition from spin up to spin down was first detected in gx 1 + 4 , makishima et al .",
    "( 1988 ) instead suggested that the previous disk had dissipated and a new disk had formed with a reversed sense of rotation . instead of undergoing mass transfer by roche - lobe overflow",
    ", they argued that gx 1 + 4 is accreting from a dense , subsonic wind from its m giant companion ; transient formation of alternating prograde and retrograde disks are known to occur in numerical simulations of wind - fed systems ( fryxell & taam 1988 ) .",
    "the formation of a retrograde disk would also explain the similar torque magnitudes in both states , and obviates the need for an ultrastrong magnetic dipole field , @xmath36 g , if this slow pulsar ( @xmath37 s ) is to corotate with the inner accretion disk , @xmath38 .",
    "chakrabarty et al .",
    "( 1997b ) have recently found surprising evidence , however , which supports the presence of a retrograde accretion disk in gx 1 + 4 .",
    "while in an extended spin - down state , gx 1 + 4 spins down more rapidly during short - term 20 - 50 kev ( @xmath1 day ) flares observed with batse .",
    "that is , the torque is _ anticorrelated _ with the observed flux .",
    "this is opposite the prediction of standard spin - down theory ( see fig 1 . ) . at higher accretion rates the magnetosphere should move inward away from corotation , reducing the magnetic spin - down torques while increasing the material spin - up torques . on the other hand ,",
    "if gx 1 + 4 is accreting from a retrograde disk , one expects the spin - down rate to increase with luminosity . in that case",
    "the material really does carry negative angular momentum relative to the neutron star rotation .",
    "could the torque transitions seen in other x - ray pulsars also be due to alternating episodes of prograde and retrograde rotation ?",
    "this hypothesis would naturally explain several puzzling aspects of the batse observations .",
    "if the disks in these systems are somehow produced with both senses of rotation one expects the observed two - state torque behavior  the material can only circulate one way or the other .",
    "moreover , transitions between torque states of the same sign will never occur , and for comparable mass accretion rates the torques should have comparable magnitudes ; in the simplest picture , @xmath39 .",
    "the time intervals between torque reversals are also consistent with the global disk viscous times in these systems @xmath40 days - yrs for a fully ionized shakura - sunyaev disk with @xmath41 .",
    "one can imagine a cycle where a disk form , accretes all of its material , and then a new disk forms with the opposite sense of rotation .    if these binaries undergo mass transfer by standard roche - lobe overflow we know of no mechanism that could produce a stable retrograde disk .",
    "the specific angular momentum initially carried by the accretion stream @xmath42 ( @xmath43 is the distance from the neutron star to the first lagrange point , and @xmath44 is the orbital frequency ) is comparable to the specific orbital angular momentum of the companion star and should circularize in the prograde sense well before reaching the pulsar magnetosphere ( lubow & shu 1975 ) .",
    "however , transient disks with alternating sense of rotation are known to form in numerical simulations of non - axisymmetric wind - fed accretion ( fryxell and taam 1988 ; ruffert 1997 ) .",
    "it may be possible that the disks in these systems are fed from a stellar wind , rather than from roche - lobe overflow as is commonly assumed .",
    "davidsen , malina & bowyer ( 1977 ) . suggested that gx  1 + 4 accretes from a slow dense wind from its m - giant companion .",
    "the massive ob - type companion of cen x-3 is close to roche - lobe filling ( van paradijs 1983 , chakrabarty et al .",
    "1993 ) , but should also have a strong stellar wind ( day & stevens 1993 ) , as should the massive companion of oao  1657415 .",
    "the ultra - compact binary 4u 1626 - 67 is a more challenging case .",
    "the small upper limit on its mass function @xmath45 and probable 42-min orbit is usually interpreted as indicating a very low - mass hydrogen - depleted main sequence star or degenerate he dwarf undergoing roche - lobe overflow ( verbunt , wijers & burm 1990 ; chakrabarty et al .",
    "1997a ) . based on _ asca",
    "_ detection of neon emission lines near 1 kev , angelini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggested the companion star may be a helium burning star with a very strong mass outflow .",
    "however , this scenario requires a very small and improbable orbital inclination ( @xmath46 for @xmath47 ) and high mass outflow .",
    "alternatively , the x - ray flux from the pulsar itself may induce a self - excited wind in this system ( basko 1977 ; tavani & london 1993 ) .",
    "indeed , for a distance @xmath48 kpc , the incident x - ray flux at the companion surface is a factor @xmath49 larger than the flux incident on the companion of her x-1 , the system for which the x - ray excited mass loss models were invented . assuming the companion is an @xmath50 main - sequence star , we estimate an induced mass outflow @xmath51 ( basko 1977 ) .",
    "this is about 5 times the inferred mass accretion rate ; efficient capture of the wind is expected since the more massive neutron star dominates the binary potential well .",
    "we wish to make two points in this paper .",
    "first , the highly - sampled batse pulsar timing data is difficult to reconcile with standard explanations of spin - down accretion torques in near - equilibrium rotators , @xmath38 . according to these theories , the switching between spin up and spin down",
    "now seen in the majority of persistent batse pulsars would require repeated transitions between two mass accretion rates , with @xmath52 producing torques of comparable magnitude , but always of opposite sign .",
    "moreover , in one pulsar , the observed anticorrelation between torque and 20 - 60 kev pulsed luminosity is opposite the predicted effect .",
    "some bistable torque mechanism with a switching time scale much longer than any natural time at the inner disk boundary must be at work .",
    "this time scale is more consistent with a global disk phenomenon .",
    "recently , yi , wheeler & vishniac ( 1997 ) have suggested that the observed torque reversals may be due to a transition from a standard keplerian disk rotation law to a sub - keplerian advection - dominated flow ( adf ) ; they write the new rotation law @xmath53 with @xmath54 and assume the star is initially spinning near equilibrium .",
    "the sudden transition to adf decreases the corotation radius , @xmath55 , while the fastness parameter increases @xmath56 . assuming a gl - type torque ( eq . [ eq : gltorque ] ) in both states , it is not surprising that yi ( 1997 ) find acceptable fits to the observed transitions : for a given a , one can always adjust @xmath57 and @xmath6 to yield the observed torques before and after the transition . their fitted parameters , however , do not agree with observational constraints .",
    "@xmath6 must be near the critical accretion rates required by adf , @xmath58 ( narayan & yi 1995 ) , yet cen x-3 , gx 1 + 4 and oao 1657 - 415 are accreting at much higher rates @xmath59 ( nagase 1989 ; chakrabarty 1993 , 1997b ) .",
    "moreover , the fitted magnetic field strengths are at least an order of magnitude smaller than required for these stars to be near spin equilibrium . nevertheless , this scenario is attractive because it is consistent with the transition time scales discussed above  the adf transition itself will occur on a fast thermal time @xmath60 s , while the interval between torque transitions is set by slow changes in the mass transfer rate occurring on a global disk viscous time scale .",
    "our second point is admittedly more speculative .",
    "based on the suggestion by makishima ( 1988 ) that a reversed disk formed in the binary system containing gx  1 + 4 , the batse observations themselves are consistent with accretion from disks having alternating senses of rotation .",
    "this interpretation naturally explains the bimodal nature of the torques , the comparable torque magnitudes , the torque - luminosity anticorrelation seen in gx 1 + 4 , and the time scales between torque transitions  without requiring these systems to be near spin equilibrium .",
    "although we are unaware of any physical mechanism that could produce a reversed disk in a system undergoing roche - lobe overflow , we suggest that these binaries may be accreting from from a stellar wind , possibly self - excited by the x - rays coming from the accreting neutron star .",
    "it may be possible to test the reversed disk hypothesis with further observations . as in gx 1 + 4 , the torque in any system undergoing secular spin - down should spin down faster with increased luminosity .",
    "observations with the x - ray timing explorer may be able to determine the correlation between torque and luminosity in cen x-3 while it is in a spin - down state .",
    "we estimate that a two day pointing of cen x-3 with xte could make of order 5 torque measurements sensitive to 10% variations at the @xmath61 level .",
    "if the accretion disk is fed from an x - ray excited wind with a flip - flop type instability , changes in column density inferred from low - energy absorption may also reveal transitions in the structure of the accretion flow ( day & stevens 1993 ) .",
