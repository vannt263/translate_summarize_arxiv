    "among the methods in quantum field theory and quantum mechanical approaches to relativistic few - body systems , the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation @xcite , based on first principles and existing already for more than sixty years , remains rather popular .",
    "the solution of the bs equation in euclidean space is much more simple than in minkowski one .",
    "rather often the euclidean solution is enough , mainly when one is interested in finding the binding energy .",
    "however , in many cases ( _ e.g. _ for calculating electromagnetic ( em ) form factors ) one needs the minkowski space amplitude or , equivalently , the euclidean one with complex arguments @xcite . during the recent years",
    ", new methods to find the minkowski solution for the two - body bound state were developed and proved their efficiency , at least for simple kernels like the one - boson exchange ( obe ) .",
    "some of them @xcite are based on the nakanishi integral representation @xcite of the bs amplitude and provide , at first , the nakanishi weight function , which then allows to restore the bs amplitude and the light front ( lf ) wave function .    other methods based on the appropriate treatment of the singularities in the bs equation , provide the minkowski solution directly , both for bound and scattering states @xcite .",
    "the straightforward numerical extrapolation of the solution from euclidean to minkowski space is very unstable and has not achieved any significant progress of practical interest .",
    "however , the above mentioned nakanishi integral representation provides a more reliable method .",
    "it is valid for the euclidean @xmath0 as well as for the minkowski @xmath1 solutions and both solutions are expressed via one and the same nakanishi weight function @xmath2 .",
    "this integral representation , given in detail in the next section , can be symbolically written in the form : @xmath3 and @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote respectively the nakanishi two - dimensional integral kernels in euclidean and minkowski spaces and g the weight function for the two - body bound state .    solving the integral equation ( [ phineg ] ) relative to @xmath2 and substituting the result into relation ( [ phinmg ] )",
    ", one can in principle determine the minkowski amplitude @xmath1 starting with the euclidean one @xmath0 .",
    "this strategy seems applicable since , in contrast to the direct extrapolation @xmath7 , it uses the analytical properties of the bs amplitude which are implemented in the nakanishi representation .",
    "a similar integral relation exist expressing the lf wave function @xmath8 in terms of the nakanishi weight function @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath9    one of the most remarkable interests of the nakanishi representation is that it constitutes a common root for the three different formal objects @xmath10 allowing to determine any of them once known any other , and thus providing a link between two theoretical approaches  bethe - salpeter and light - front dynamics  which are in principle and in practice quite different .",
    "since the lf wave function can be also found independently either by solving the corresponding equation @xcite ( see for instance @xcite ) or by means of quantum field theory ( qft ) inspired approaches like the discrete light cone quantization @xcite or the basis light front quantization approach @xcite , one can pose the problem of finding the nakanishi weight function from equation ( [ psilg ] ) .",
    "this equation is only one - dimensional .",
    "its solution is more simple , it requires matrices of smaller dimension and therefore it is more stable than the solution of the 2d equation ( [ phineg ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the same method can be applied , far beyond the obe dynamics , to the complete qft dynamical content of the lattice calculations .",
    "therein , the full ( not restricted to the obe kernel ) euclidean bs amplitude can be obtained and , via the nakanishi integral , the corresponding bs amplitude in minkowski space can be calculated as well as the observables .",
    "the nakanishi representation was used in @xcite to calculate the parton distribution amplitude for the pion .",
    "the first results of our research in this field were published in @xcite . we have found that the solution of the integral equation ( [ phineg ] ) relative to @xmath2 was rather unstable . in order to find numerical solution ,",
    "this integral equation was discretized using two quite different methods ( gauss quadratures and splines ) and it resulted into a linear system .",
    "the instability of its the solution dramatically increases with the matrix dimension .",
    "it turned out that the equation ( [ phineg ] ) is a fredholm equation of the first kind , which mathematically a classical example of an ill - posed problem . on the other hand",
    ", this equation has a unique solution .",
    "the challenge here is to use an appropriate method allowing us to find this solution .",
    "these mathematical methods are developed and well known . using them and knowing either @xmath0 or @xmath11 we aim to extract @xmath2 and find from it @xmath1 and the corresponding observables .",
    "this will demonstrate that this procedure is feasible to get the solution .",
    "the appearance of mathematically well defined but numerically ill - posed problems is not a rare exception .",
    "it is , for instance , manifested when using the stieltjes and lorentz integral transforms @xcite to solve the scattering few - body problems with bound state boundary conditions or when extracting the general parton distributions ( gpd ) from the experimental data @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will proceed according to the following steps .    in a first step",
    ", we will solve numerically equations ( [ phineg ] ) and ( [ psilg ] ) in a toy model where @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath2 are known analytically .",
    "the comparison of the numerical solutions for @xmath2 with the analytical one will tell us the reliability of our method in solving the one dimensional and two - dimensional fredholm first kind equations .    in a second step",
    ", we will go over a more realistic dynamical case .",
    "there , @xmath0 is obtained by solving the euclidean bs equation .",
    "the lf wave function is given by equation ( [ psilg ] ) , where @xmath2 is calculated by using the methods introduced in @xcite , to solve the minkowski bs equation , and based on the lf projection and nakanishi representation . in order to keep trace of its origin",
    "we will denote it by @xmath13 .    by solving equations ( [ phineg ] ) and ( [ psilg ] )",
    ", we find @xmath2 in two independent ways  denoted respectively @xmath14 and @xmath15  to be compared with each other as well as with @xmath13 .",
    "our methods should be consistent as far as all these weight functions are reasonably close to each other .",
    "this wave function @xmath11 , found by projecting he bs amplitude in the light - front , and the @xmath11 one obtained from solving the lf equation , are practically indistinguishable from each other .",
    "we find also the minkowski bs amplitude @xmath1 and using it , we calculate observables , namely , em form factor and momentum distribution , represented by the lf wave function .",
    "we also calculate the form factor independently , expressing it via the lf wave function @xmath11 .",
    "it turned out that the form factors calculated by these two ways are very close to each other and practically insensitive to instabilities of @xmath2 s remaining after their suppression by the method we use .",

    "their deviation seen in fig .",
    "[ fflfbs ] is caused not only by numerical uncertainties , but also by physical reasons .",
    "this deviation can not be completely removed by more precise calculations . from point of view of the fock decomposition of the state vector ,",
    "the form factor @xmath176 is determined only by the two - body contribution in the state vector , whereas @xmath177 , determined by the two - body bs amplitude , includes implicitly the effect of higher lf fock states .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the contribution of the higher fock components can be found knowing only the two - body component . indeed , inverting eq .",
    "( [ lfwf1 ] ) , we extract @xmath15 from the two - body lf wave function @xmath11 .",
    "it is the same @xmath2 that enters in the minkowski bs amplitude ( [ nak ] ) and in the form factor ( [ ffm ] ) , including the higher sector contributions .",
    "as it was just mentioned , the form factor ( [ ffm ] ) ( calculated with @xmath15 extracted from the two - body lf wave function ) includes implicitly not only the two - body component contribution but also the higher fock components .",
    "so , this higher fock sector contribution is found from the two - body component which was taken as input . though it seems a little bit paradoxical ( the possibility to get information about higher fock states from the two - body one ) , this is , probably , a manifestation of self - consistency of the fock decomposition embedded in the nakanishi integral representation . in the field - theoretical framework",
    "( in which only the bs amplitude can be defined via the heisenberg field operators @xcite ) , the number of particles is not conserved and the existence of one fock component requires the existence of other ones .",
    "the set of them , corresponding to different numbers of particles , ensures also the correct transformation properties of the full state vector @xmath178 since the fock components are transformed by dynamical lf boosts in each other .",
    "the fact that the difference between form factors determined by the two - body lf wave function and the form factor including higher components is small was found also in wick - cutkosky model @xcite .",
    "the contribution of many - body components with @xmath179 reaches 36% in the full normalization integral @xmath180 only for the coupling constant so huge that the total mass of the bound system tends to zero .    a final remark : the stability of the form factors obtained from @xmath14 , though quite unexpected in view of the sizeable difference of the nakanishi weight functions ( see e.g. fig . [ fpsi42 ] ) , is in fact appropriate .",
    "as we have discussed in the analytical example , the reason for the instability of the solution of the linear system is the contribution from the very small eigenvalues .",
    "therefore the difference between the @xmath14 s comes from the corresponding eigenvectors which induce the observed oscillations .",
    "however , when using the minkowski bs amplitude to compute the form factor , the contributions from the eigenvectors with small eigenvalues are damped in the same way they were enhanced in the inversion .",
    "it is very likely that this result follows from the fact that the spectra of the nakanishi kernels in minkowski and euclidean spaces are the same .",
    "we have demonstrated by explicit calculations , that the nakanishi representations of the bethe - salpeter amplitude in euclidean space ( @xmath0 ) and the light - front wave function ( @xmath11 ) can be numerically inverted .",
    "if one of this two quantities is known , one can easily calculate the other one as well as the bethe - salpeter amplitude in minkowski space ( @xmath1 ) and associated observables , like the electromagnetic form factor .",
    "we have developed an analytically solvable model , in the framework of which we compared the accuracy of the numerical solution with the analytical one .",
    "though the inversion of a fredholm integral equation of the first kind providing @xmath2 is an ill - posed problem , it can be solved with satisfactory precision by using appropriate methods .",
    "our best results are obtained with the tikhonov regularization procedure .",
    "this method is rather efficient and it allowed to successfully overcome the instabilities of the solution which we found in a previous work @xcite when computed @xmath2 from @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , it turns out that the light - front wave function and observables are insensitive to the residual uncertainty of @xmath2 which remains after stabilizing the solution by the regularization .",
    "the uncertainties on the light - front wave function are within less than 1% , that is much smaller than for @xmath181 .",
    "the nakanishi weight function @xmath2 was expanded in terms of gegenbauer polynomials .",
    "a small number of terms in this decomposition is required to control the instabilities .",
    "this method is very efficient for describing monotonic behaviors but it is not sufficient to reproduce more involved structure of @xmath2 like the ones provided by the dynamical model .",
    "the later ones generate considerable uncertainties in the inversion procedure .",
    "increase of the number of terms in the decomposition gives more flexibility , but , at the same time , it enhances the numerical instability of the solution .",
    "we believe that it would be useful to study other basis or discretization methods , reflecting more the particular functional form of @xmath2 .",
    "our approach can find interesting applications to extract minkowski amplitudes from an euclidean theory , like for instance lattice qcd .",
    "the euclidean bs amplitude is being currently computed there with the full dynamical contents of the theory .",
    "if one is able to extract from it the corresponding nakanishi weight function @xmath2 , one can access to time - like form factors , momentum distributions , gpd s and tmd s which are not accessible in a direct way .",
    "this could considerably simplify the study of the minkowski space structure of hadrons from lattice qcd ab - initio calculations .",
