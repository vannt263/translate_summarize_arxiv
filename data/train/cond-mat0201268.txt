    "glasses are out of equilibrium systems , which are characterized by a slow relaxation , which is often much longer than any laboratory scale .",
    "one of the main consequences is that after a quench into the glassy phase the properties of a glassy material depend on the time spent below the glass transition temperature @xmath2 , that is to say the system ages .    the aging of glassy materials is a widely studied phenomenon @xcite . in spite of the interesting experimental @xcite and theoretical progress @xcite , done in the last years , the physical mechanisms of aging are not",
    "yet fully understood .",
    "in fact on the basis of available experimental data it is very difficult to distinguish which is the most suitable theoretical approach for describing the aging processes of different materials . in order to give more insight into this problem several experimental procedures",
    "have been proposed and applied to the study of the aging of various materials , such as spin - glasses ( sg)@xcite , orientational glasses ( og)@xcite , polymers @xcite and supercooled liquids ( sl)@xcite .",
    "the very well known kovacs@xcite experiment was probably among the first in showing that the state of a glass is strongly determined by its thermal history . in the kovacs experiment the material",
    "is submitted to the following temperature cycle .",
    "the material is rapidly quenched from the liquid to the glass phase at a temperature @xmath3 at which the volume of the glass is @xmath4 . because of aging the volume of the material decreases as a function of time going from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "then the material is rapidly heated at a temperature @xmath6 at which @xmath7 is the equilibrium volume .",
    "one could think that no appreciable evolution appears as a function of time .",
    "instead the volume first increases , reaches a maximum and then decreases to reach again the value @xmath5 .",
    "the amplitude of the maximum depends of course on @xmath3 .",
    "another example of history dependent effect is that induced by the aging at low temperature , known as prepeak in polymer literature @xcite .",
    "such an aging does not produce important changes in the enthalpy .",
    "however when increasing temperature , a peak in the curve of the heat capacity versus temperature is observed at a temperature close to @xmath2 .",
    "other procedures were proposed for spin glasses and applied to other materials . among these procedures",
    "we may recall the applications of small temperature cycles to a sample during the aging time@xcite .",
    "these experiments have shown three main results in different materials : i ) there is an important difference between positive and negative cycles and the details of the response to these perturbations are material dependent @xcite ; ii ) for sg @xcite the time spent at the higher temperature sort of reinitialize the aging at a lower temperature whereas for plexiglass ( pmma ) @xcite and og @xcite it only slightly modifies the long time behavior ; iii ) a memory effect has been observed for negative cycles .",
    "specifically when temperature goes back to the high temperature the system recovers its state before perturbation .",
    "in other words the time spent at low enough temperature does not contribute to the aging behavior at the higher temperature .    in order to have a better understanding of the free energy landscape of sg and og ,",
    "a new cooling protocol has been proposed @xcite and used in several experiments @xcite .",
    "this protocol , which is characterized by a temporary cooling stop , has revealed that in sg and in og the low temperature state is independent of the complete cooling history but that these materials keep the memory of all the aging history ( _ memory effect _ ) @xcite .    in a recent paper",
    "@xcite we described an experiment where we have used the cooling protocol , proposed in ref.@xcite , to show that memory effects are present during the aging of the dielectric constant of plexiglass ( pmma ) , which is a polymer glass with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to extend the results of ref.@xcite and to show that more complex temperature cycle can be observed .",
    "the deletion effect is also discussed .",
    "finally we compare the behavior of pmma to that of sg and og , submitted to the same cooling protocol .",
    "as we already mentioned several kinds @xcite of `` memory effects '' for polymers have been described in literature .",
    "the most famous one is that of kovacs @xcite .",
    "however the thermal cycles used in these experiments are quite different from those proposed in @xcite .",
    "thus it is interesting to check how polymers behave when they are submitted to this new thermal procedure , which can give new insight on the aging of these materials .",
    "moreover , the use of the same protocols makes the comparison between different kinds of glasses easier .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the experimental set - up and we discuss the results of a single quench experiment .",
    "the aging properties of the pmma dielectric constant are studied as a function of the quench temperature and of the measuring frequency . in section 3 the measure and",
    "the features of the memory effect are analyzed . in section 4",
    "the memory deletion and the double memory effect are described . finally in section 5",
    "the results on the pmma dielectric constant are discussed and compared with those observed in other systems .",
    "to determine the dielectric constant , we measure the complex impedance of a capacitor whose dielectric is the pmma sample . in our experiment a disk of pmma of diameter @xmath9 and thickness @xmath10 is inserted between the plates of a capacitor whose vacuum capacitance is @xmath11 ( see fig.[fig : experiment ] for details ) .",
    "the capacitor is inside an oven whose temperature @xmath12 may be changed from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "the temperature stability is within @xmath15 .",
    "the maximum heating and cooling rate @xmath16 is about @xmath17 .",
    "we checked that the temperature difference between the two capacitor plates is always smaller than @xmath18 both during the heating and the cooling cycles .",
    "the capacitor is a component of the feedback loop of a precision voltage amplifier whose input is connected to a signal generator .",
    "we obtain the real and imaginary part of the capacitor impedance by measuring the response of the amplifier to a sinusoidal input signal .",
    "this apparatus allows us to measure the real and imaginary part of the dielectric constant @xmath19 as a function of temperature @xmath12 , frequency @xmath20 and time @xmath21 .",
    "relative variations of @xmath0 smaller than @xmath22 can be measured in all the frequency range used in this experiment , i.e. @xmath23 . the following discussion will focus only on @xmath24 ( thus we will omit subscript 1 ) , for which we have the best accuracy , but the behavior of @xmath25 leads to the same conclusions .",
    "the measurement is performed in the following way .",
    "we first initialize the pmma history by heating the sample at a temperature @xmath26 .",
    "the sample is left at @xmath27 for a few hours , so that equilibrium can be assumed for the initial condition .",
    "the temperature is rapidly decreased at @xmath28 to a temperature @xmath29 , where it is regulated by the oven .",
    "the zero of the aging time is taken at the instant , during the quench , when the sample temperature is equal to @xmath2 .",
    "typical aging curves of @xmath0 as a function of time are shown in fig.[fig : refagi ] , for different @xmath30 at @xmath31 and different @xmath20 at @xmath32 .",
    "we clearly notice a logarithmic dependence on time of the dielectric constant as soon as the temperature is stabilized , in all the temperature and frequency range we have explored .",
    "however the aging curve depends on @xmath30 and @xmath20 : the sample properties evolve faster when @xmath30 is close to @xmath2 and @xmath20 is small",
    ".    specifically one can write @xmath33 with @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the value of @xmath0 at @xmath36 .",
    "it is found that @xmath35 and @xmath37 are functions of @xmath30 and of the frequency @xmath20 at which the dielectric constant is measured .",
    "note that as a and b depends also weakly on the cooling rate @xmath38 , we always use @xmath28 in these experiments .",
    "the values of @xmath37 , measured at @xmath31 , are plotted in fig.[fig : alpha](a ) as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath37 is an increasing function of @xmath30 till a temperature @xmath39 close to @xmath2 , but goes down to 0 if @xmath40 .",
    "indeed for a quench temperature larger than @xmath2 the sample can reach a thermodynamic equilibrium , so no aging is observed but only a relaxation of @xmath0 toward its stationary value .",
    "the long time behavior is stationary and @xmath37 goes to @xmath41 .",
    "the values of @xmath37 , measured at @xmath32 , are plotted in fig.[fig : alpha](b ) as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath37 is a slowly increasing function for @xmath42 .",
    "indeed aging is smaller at high frequencies than at low frequencies ( a theoretical justification of such a behavior can be found for example in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "these curves determine the region where to work . in our dielectric measurement aging",
    "can be accurately observed between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we will probe @xmath45 and @xmath46 where aging effects are the largest in our frequency range .",
    "in this section , we describe experiments following the protocols first proposed in ref.@xcite : a temporary stop is done during the cooling of the sample , and its consequence on the dielectric constant behavior are studied .",
    "the measurement is performed in the following way : again , the pmma history is first reinitialized by heating the sample at a temperature @xmath26 and leaving it at @xmath27 for a few hours .",
    "then it is slowly cooled from @xmath47 to a temperature @xmath48 at the constant rate @xmath38 and heated back to @xmath47 at the same @xmath49 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath12 obtained by cooling and heating the sample at a constant @xmath49 , is called the reference curve @xmath50 .    as an example of reference curve",
    "we plot in fig.[fig : tempcyc1](a ) @xmath50 , measured at @xmath51 and at @xmath52 .",
    "we see that @xmath50 presents a hysteresis between the cooling and the heating in the interval @xmath53 .",
    "this hysteresis depends on the cooling and heating rates . indeed , in fig.[fig : tempcyc1](b ) , the difference between the heating curve ( @xmath54 ) and the cooling curve ( @xmath55 ) is plotted as a function of @xmath12 for different @xmath49 .",
    "the faster we change temperature , the bigger hysteresis we get .",
    "furthermore the temperature of the hysteresis maximum is a few degrees above @xmath2 , specifically at @xmath56 .",
    "the temperature of this maximum gets closer to @xmath2 when the rate is decreased .",
    "we neglect for the moment the rate dependence of the hysteresis and we consider as reference curve the one , plotted in fig.[fig : tempcyc1](a ) , which has been obtained at @xmath57 and at @xmath52",
    ". the evolution of @xmath0 can be quite different from @xmath50 if we use the temperature cycle proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "after a cooling at @xmath58 from @xmath47 to @xmath59 the sample is maintained at @xmath30 for @xmath60 .",
    "after this time interval the sample is cooled again , at the same @xmath38 , down to @xmath61 .",
    "once the sample temperature reaches @xmath61 the sample is heated again at @xmath62 up to @xmath47 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath12 , obtained when the sample is submitted to this temperature cycle with the cooling stop at @xmath30 , is called the memory curve @xmath63 . in fig.[fig : tempcyc2](a ) , @xmath63 ( solid line ) , measured at @xmath64 , is plotted as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the reference curve of fig.[fig : tempcyc1](a ) .",
    "we notice that @xmath63 relaxes downwards when cooling is stopped at @xmath30 : this corresponds to the vertical line in fig.[fig : tempcyc2](a ) where @xmath63 departs from @xmath50 .",
    "when cooling is resumed @xmath63 merges into @xmath50 for @xmath65 .",
    "the aging at @xmath30 has not influenced the result at low temperature .",
    "this effect has been called _ rejuvenation _ in recent papers @xcite .    during the heating period",
    "the system reminds the aging at @xmath30 ( cooling stop ) and for @xmath66 the evolution of @xmath63 is quite different from @xmath50 . in order to clearly see this effect we divide @xmath63 in the cooling part @xmath67 and the heating part @xmath68 . in fig.[fig : tempcyc2](b ) we plot the difference between @xmath63 and @xmath50 .",
    "filled downwards arrows correspond to cooling ( @xmath69 ) and empty upward arrows to heating ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the difference between the evolutions corresponding to different cooling procedures is now quite clear .",
    "the system reminds its previous aging history when it is reheated from @xmath61 .",
    "the amplitude of the memory corresponds well to the amplitude of the aging at @xmath30 but the temperature of the maximum is shifted a few degrees above @xmath30 .",
    "on fig.[fig : tstopdependance ] we show that this temperature shift is independent of @xmath30 for temperatures where aging can be measured in a reasonable time ( above @xmath71 ) .",
    "in contrast the amplitude of the downward relaxation at @xmath30 is a decreasing function of @xmath30 , as expected from the first section measurements : no aging can be measured at @xmath72 ( see fig.[fig : alpha](a ) ) .",
    "this memory effect seems to be permanent because it does not depend on the waiting time at @xmath61 .",
    "indeed we performed several experiments in which we waited till @xmath73 at @xmath61 , before restarting heating , without noticing any change in the heating cycle .",
    "in contrast the amplitude and the position of the memory effect depend on @xmath38 and on the measuring frequency . as an example of frequency dependence , we compare in fig.[fig : frequ ] two measurements done with the same @xmath74 and waiting time @xmath75 but for two different frequencies : @xmath57 and @xmath31 .",
    "again , as expected from the first section measurements , the higher is the frequency , the smaller is the downward relaxation , so the smaller is the memory effect .",
    "the positions of the maxima are at the same temperature .    as an example of rate dependence , at @xmath57 and @xmath75 , we plot in fig.[fig : rate ] the difference @xmath76 as a function of @xmath12 for three different rates .",
    "the faster is the rate , the larger is the downward relaxation of the dielectric constant during the cooling stop . as the amplitude of the memory effect is equal to that of the relaxation , we just expect the memory effect to increase with @xmath49 .",
    "but as we can see on fig.[fig : rate ] , the temperature positions of the maxima are rate dependent too : the larger is @xmath49 , the farther the temperature of the maximum is shifted above the aging temperature @xmath30 .",
    "the cooling rate is not the only control parameter of the memory effect , the heating rate is relevant too .",
    "in this section we apply to the pmma sample more complicated temperature histories ( inspired from spins glasses experiments @xcite ) : what happens if we try to read a memory twice ? if we make two cooling stops ?      in this experiment , we show that a memory can be read only one single time : reading a memory effect also deletes it .",
    "this experiment is inspired from similar ones done in spin glasses @xcite .",
    "first we follow the classic procedure described in the previous section : during the cooling ramp at @xmath77 , a temporary stop is done for @xmath78 at @xmath79 , and then heating the sample from @xmath61 with the same @xmath49 . in fig.[fig : delete](a ) we plot the difference between the heating branches of @xmath63 and @xmath50 measured at @xmath57 .",
    "the departure from the reference curve above @xmath30 when lowering temperature is due to a smooth cutting of cooling , but this imperfection has no detectable effect on the heating curve .",
    "we can follow the memory of the cooling stop at @xmath30 , and when the memory curve almost merges the reference one , for @xmath80 , we quickly stop heating and resume cooling at @xmath58 . notice that this inversion temperature @xmath81 is smaller than @xmath2 , which means that the sample has not been reinitialized .",
    "when @xmath61 is reached again , we make a classic heating at @xmath82 ( see the temperature history of the sample in the inset of fig.[fig : delete](a ) ) .",
    "this second heating curve is really different from the first one : there are no tracks of the cooling stop at @xmath79 , but something like the memory of a stop around @xmath83 .",
    "what we see now is in fact only the memory of the stop at @xmath81 : as the sample stays a few minutes around @xmath81 ( the time needed to inverse @xmath38 to @xmath84 ) , it ages a little at @xmath81 and we find a memory of this event .",
    "this can be checked on fig.[fig : delete](b ) , where we only show the memory of the inversion at the same temperature @xmath81 , without the first memory .",
    "the curves corresponding to the second heating are exactly the same for the two experiments , showing that the first heating deletes all information about temperatures lower than @xmath81 , even though @xmath85 .",
    "more insight on the properties of the memory effects can be obtained by submitting the sample to a more complex cooling procedure consisting of two cooling stops .",
    "this procedure , which has been called the double memory effect , has been carried out successfully in spin glasses @xcite where it has been observed that if two stops are done during cooling , the heating curve will present a memory effect for both stops .",
    "the difficulty that arise when trying to reproduce this experiment in pmma is the narrowness of the aging range : when cooling the sample under @xmath30 , @xmath63 rejoins the reference curve only for temperatures where aging almost vanishes .",
    "it is therefore difficult to record two well distinct cooling stops .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig : doublerecord ] , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 : @xmath63 has not completely merged into @xmath50 when we stop cooling for the second time .",
    "the double memory experiments allows us to point out another important property of pmma aging : when temperature is lowered after the first stop , the system not only recover the same value of @xmath0 , but also the same aging properties .",
    "indeed , a @xmath88 stop at @xmath89 produces the same downward relaxation of @xmath0 , whatever the previous history is .",
    "the low temperature state is thus completely uninfluenced by the high temperature history .    if we now heat the sample after the two cooling stops , we obtain the bolt curve of fig.[fig : doubleread ] .",
    "if the memory of @xmath90 is obvious , the lower temperature stop at @xmath91 must be hidden in the first part of the curve . in order to check the presence of the memory effect of the second stop ,",
    "let us suppose that this effect is just additive , that is the memory of a double stop is just the sum of the memory of both individual stops if their temperature is sufficiently different .",
    "so we plot with a dashed line in fig.[fig : doubleread ] the sum of the single memories of @xmath90 and @xmath91 . within errors bars ,",
    "the two curves are the same , so we conclude that even if the memory effects overlap in the narrow aging range of pmma , double memory experiments also work in this polymer .",
    "we have applied to a pmma sample the same temperature cycle used to study memory and rejuvenation effects in various kinds of spin glasses and in orientational glasses .",
    "our dielectric measurements clearly show the presence of rejuvenation and memory in pmma .",
    "as we already mentioned in the introduction the observation of a memory of the thermal history in pmma is not new .",
    "however this memory effect has been obtained with a thermal protocol which is quite different from the one described in this paper .",
    "thus the application to a polymer glass of the same procedure used in og and sg allow us to address the question of the universality of the memory and rejuvenation phenomena in different materials .",
    "this is a very important point in to understand whether the same theoretical approach can be used to describe aging phenomena in different materials .      *",
    "the reference curve @xmath50 , obtained at constant cooling and heating rate @xmath49 is hysteretic .",
    "this hysteresis is maximum a few degrees above @xmath2 .",
    "* the hysteresis of @xmath50 increases with @xmath49 . * writing memory : a cooling stop produces a downward relaxation of @xmath63 .",
    "the amplitude of this downward relaxation depends on @xmath30 and it decreases for decreasing @xmath30 .",
    "it almost disappears for @xmath72 . *",
    "when cooling is resumed @xmath0 goes back to the cooling branch of the reference curve .",
    "this suggests that the low temperature state is independent on the cooling history .",
    "* reading memory : upon reheating @xmath63 reminds the aging history and the cooling stop ( _ memory _ ) .",
    "the maximum of the memory effect is obtained a few degrees above @xmath30 .",
    "* the memory effect does not depend on the waiting time at low temperature but it depends both on the cooling and heating rates .",
    "the memory effect increases with @xmath49 . *",
    "double memory effects are observed with more difficulty in pmma than in sg .",
    "the difference comes from the fact that aging effects are reduced when temperature is lowered .",
    "however a careful analysis of experimental data allows us to show the existence of double memory effects in pmma . *",
    "the memory effect is deleted by a reading , even if the temperature remains smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "analogies between point a - b ) for the hysteresis and point e - f ) for the rate dependence of the memory effect leads to a new interpretation of hysteresis , which can be seen as the memory of aging at a temperature @xmath92 . indeed in a free energy landscape model , a sample , which is cooled just above @xmath2 ,",
    "is in its equilibrium phase , that is in a favorable configuration at this temperature .",
    "if this configuration is not strongly modified by aging at lower temperatures then , when heating back to @xmath2 , the system reminds this favorable state , just as it does in the memory effect .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the analogies and the differences between this experiment and similar ones performed on sg @xcite and on og @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , neglecting the hysteresis of the reference curve of pmma and of og , the behavior of these materials is quite similar to that of sg .",
    "a strong rate dependence has been observed in ising spin glasses too @xcite . during the heating period pmma , sg and",
    "og remind their aging history , although the precise way , in which history is remembered , is material dependent .",
    "furthermore in these materials the low temperature state is independent on the cooling history .",
    "one can estimate the temperature range @xmath93 where the material response is different from that of the reference curve because of the cooling stop .",
    "it turns out that the ratio @xmath94 is roughly the same in pmma , in sg and in og , specifically @xmath95 .",
    "the important difference between sg and pmma is in the dependence on @xmath30 of the amplitude of the downward relaxation : it is strong in pmma and weak in sg .",
    "our results seem to indicate that memory and rejuvenation phenomena in the aging process may be described by models based on a hierarchical free energy landscape , whose barriers grow when temperature is lowered @xcite .",
    "however the dependence of the memory effect on @xmath49 and the independence on the waiting time at @xmath61 mean that , at least for pmma , the free energy landscape has to depend not only on temperature but also on @xmath49 .",
    "many models @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite do not take into account this dependence because they consider just a static temperature after a quench .",
    "in contrast point f ) indicates that the cooling history is relevant too .",
    "these difficulties can be avoided if one considers models based on a slow domain growth and domain walls reconformations in the pinning field created by disorder ( see for example ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these models imply the existence of a hierarchy of length scales @xmath96 with a characteristic time @xmath97 .",
    "recent numerical simulations @xcite show that this is an important ingredient in order to have memory / rejuvenation effects .",
    "however one of the drawbacks of such a model is that memory is recovered only if the time spent at low temperature is short enough@xcite .",
    "this effect does not seem to be true for pmma , at least on reasonable laboratory time scales .    as a conclusion",
    "the `` memory '' and rejuvenation effects seem to be two universal features of aging whereas the hysteresis is present in pmma and in og but not in all kinds of spin glasses",
    ". it would be interesting to know whether these effects are observed in other polymers and in supercooled liquids , and whether the hysteresis interpretation in terms of a memory effect could hold for other materials .",
    "these measurements show that many features of aging seem to be `` universal '' in several materials and that models based on spin glasses may be useful to describe aging in polymeric materials .",
