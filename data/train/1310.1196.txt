    "high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) , has attracted immense interest due to its novel applications in ultra - fast science  @xcite . from a semi - classical viewpoint ,",
    "the electron dynamics leading to the hhg process can simply be described by the three - step model @xcite , in which ( 1 ) an electron is detached from an atom by a laser field ; ( 2 ) it propagates in the continuum until ( 3 ) its recombination with the atom , accompanied by photon emission .",
    "the maximum photon energy that can be generated is given by the cut - off law @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the binding energy of the active electron @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 is the maximum kinetic energy acquired in the laser field and @xmath3 is the ponderomotive potential : @xmath4 .    in recent years ,",
    "there has been renewed interest in the fundamental aspects of hhg , primarily based on the scaling of its yield in terms of both the laser wavelength and intensity  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the integrated harmonic yield , obtained by integrating the power spectrum @xmath5 within a fixed photon energy interval , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath6 contrasts with the conventional @xmath7 scaling of the harmonic yield , predicted as early as in the mid-90s  @xcite , which originates from wave - packet spread .",
    "recent theoretical calculations of single atom response and also experimental observations ( designed so that macroscopic effects are minimized ) revealed a rapid decline in harmonic efficiency , scaling as @xmath8-@xmath9 , suggesting that global scaling can depend on the field intensity and atomic species of interest  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been proposed that the variations in the overall wavelength scaling can also be phase - dependent in the limit of ultra - short laser fields  @xcite .",
    "the scaling remains roughly @xmath8 , but a substantial variation with carrier - envelope phase emerges . for molecules , on the other hand , a more dramatic decrease is predicted .",
    "this is attributed to fast ground - state depletion forced by interatomic ( vibrational ) motion excited by radiation at longer wavelengths  @xcite .",
    "there are a number of studies addressing the origin of this rapid decrease in harmonic yield as well as its intensity and target atom dependence as a function of the laser wavelength  @xcite . according to  @xcite",
    ", the @xmath10 scaling of the size of the plateau region in the harmonic spectrum in a classical framework can bring an additional @xmath11 factor in the overall scaling . along with",
    "the @xmath12 scaling due to the wave - packet spread , this results in @xmath8 for overall scaling , consistent with quantum mechanical predictions  @xcite .",
    "however , a factor of @xmath11 originates from the definition of the integrated harmonic yield   itself since @xmath13 .",
    "schiessl _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that in the 800 - 2000 nm wavelength range , harmonic yield exhibits a series of rapid fluctuations with a period of 6 - 20 nm instead of a smooth decrease .",
    "they have identified the origin of these fine - scale oscillations as the interference fringes of rescattering electron trajectories .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that the peak positions of these fringes correspond to enhancement of harmonic yield due to opening of a multiphoton ionization channel .",
    "the number of photons @xmath14 the atom needs to absorb to escape through this channel is called the  channel closing number \" , and obeys  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the laser frequency and @xmath17 is the ionization potential of the target atom .    in a typical hhg process",
    ", the ionization dynamics falls into the tunneling regime ( characterized by the keldysh parameter , @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , it has been recently demonstrated  @xcite that @xmath18 is not a sufficient condition by itself for tunneling to dominate .",
    "if the minimum number of photons that needs to be absorbed for electron escape is small enough , the ionization can be dominated by photo - absorption even when @xmath19 . in this work ,",
    "the keldysh parameter ranges between @xmath200.40 and @xmath200.50 , and the atom is @xmath2040 photons below the ionization threshold , which is why these multiphoton ionization induced oscillations are referred to as  fine - scale \" oscillations .    the channel closing number in eq .",
    "can also be expressed in terms of the laser wavelength @xmath21 @xmath22 as @xmath21 is varied , the atom falls in and out of resonance with multiphoton ionization channels where the minimum number of photons to absorb for ionization is @xmath14 .    in this report",
    ", we investigate the phase - dependence of the fine - scale oscillations observed in the hhg yield in terms of the channel - closing number @xmath14 .",
    "in addition to the overall phase - dependent scaling , the amplitude of these oscillations also varies with the phase of the laser field .",
    "we find that the variations in oscillations can be compensated by a specific choice of the carrier - envelope phase ( cep ) .",
    "we contrast our results with those obtained in the  single - cycle \" limit .",
    "we use atomic units are used throughout , unless specified otherwise .",
    "we start by describing our numerical calculations .",

    "instead of presenting the integrated yield @xmath40 as function of the laser wavelength , we present our results in the channel - closing number @xmath14 ( longer @xmath21 means larger @xmath14 ) .",
    "as @xmath21 is varied , the atom falls in and out of resonance with multiphoton ionization channels while still in the tunneling regime . for longer @xmath21",
    ", it takes more photons to reach the ionization threshold and @xmath14 increases . fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] presents our results for @xmath40 , as a function of the channel - closing number @xmath14 for two different cep values calculated by solving the tdse and using the sfa model .",
    "the @xmath14 values are between 35 and 44 , which fall into the wavelength range 1000 - 1100 nm at 320 tw/@xmath45 .",
    "both curves show a distinct motif , where in the case of @xmath46 @xmath47 , the oscillations are clearly visible in agreement with the previous studies  @xcite . however , they are less clear for @xmath46 @xmath48 and shifted towards lower @xmath14 relative to those for @xmath46 @xmath47 .    an interesting feature in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] is that the peak positions in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] do not always correspond to integer values of @xmath14 .",
    "however , we find that the peaks are essentially equally spaced . this can be understood in terms of the ac stark shift experienced by a real atom in a strong laser field . because the field is not perturbative",
    ", the shift can not simply be expressed using second order perturbation theory .",
    "an alternative way of looking at this shift is as a depression of the ionization threshold by the ponderomotive potential . because @xmath49 is the quiver energy of a free electron in a laser field",
    ", it does not include information about the atom itself .",
    "the structure information about the atom is very simply encoded in @xmath17 in eq .  .",
    "effectively , this is saying that regardless of atomic structure , the ground state is always shifted by the same amount @xmath49 .",
    "this approximation introduces ambiguity in the ground state energy shift , and this ambiguity is typically blamed on @xmath17 entirely . in  @xcite ,",
    "various models for effective ionization potentials are used that better match the peak positions with integer values of @xmath14 .",
    "the weakening of the peaks going from @xmath50 to 0 in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] can be explained by the interference of multiple returning quantum trajectories  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the increase in the number of quantum trajectories leads to fine - scale oscillations in a multi - cycle laser field  @xcite . in the case of few - cycle pulses ,",
    "the number of returning quantum trajectories are smaller and are cep dependent . in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , the number of cycles at fwhm are less for the @xmath46 @xmath48 pulse than for the @xmath46 @xmath47 pulse , leading to smaller number of interfering electron trajectories than for @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "this weakens the amplitudes of the oscillations in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] in agreement with previous studies  @xcite . also clear from fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] is that the amplitudes of the oscillations do not depend on the field strength since the maximum field amplitude for the electric field is only @xmath204% lower for @xmath46 @xmath47 than that for @xmath46 @xmath48 .",
    "the effect of cep on the structure of the oscillations is less pronounced from the sfa model in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "the differences between the tdse and the sfa model can be attributed to the approximations made in sfa , _",
    "e.g. _ neglecting the excited states of the target atom and the coulomb - tail when electron is in the continuum . apart from diminishing in the oscillation amplitudes , the bottom panel of fig",
    ".  [ fig_1 ] displays the same features seen from the tdse calculations with regard to the cep dependence and the peak positions .",
    "variation of the peak positions according to the sfa model for a series of cep values between those seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_sfa_phase ] .",
    "again , some the peaks are slightly shifted from integer @xmath14 as @xmath46 is varied , and their amplitudes become smaller as @xmath46 is reduced .",
    "the peaks are separated by essentially one photon : _",
    "e.g. _ in the @xmath51 range , @xmath52 , which translates into @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath54 denotes cep average over the @xmath55 interval .",
    "another relavant laser parameter of interest that can potentially affect these oscillations is intensity .",
    "the intensity dependence of the fine - scale oscillations in @xmath40 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_sfa_intensity ] for a two - cycle laser pulse , where intensities vary between 290 and 320 tw/@xmath45 with @xmath50 . in this case",
    ", we observe no dramatic differences in the oscillation patterns for various field intensities except that their overall efficiencies increase with increasing intensity .",
    "furthermore , the amplitudes of the oscillations slightly increase with intensity .",
    "the peak positions remain the same as intensity is varied meaning that the modulation period @xmath56 is independent of field intensity we consider .",
    "this is mainly because the peak electric field strength changes only by @xmath205% from the lowest to the highest intensity in fig .",
    "[ fig_sfa_intensity ] .",
    "so far we looked at wavelength dependence of @xmath40 for atoms driven by a two - cycle pulse .",
    "wavelength scaling of hhg yield in the `` single - cycle '' limit is also of great interest , since hhg is being used as a way of generating coherent attosecond pulse trains as well as single attosecond pulses  @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the multi - cycle and single - cycle pulses is that the former support multiple electron return trajectories and attosecond pulse trains . for single - cycle pulses with a specific value of cep , single return trajectory , and as a result , single harmonic emission is possible , which is desired for isolated attosecond pulse generation .",
    "it is clear from eq .   that the @xmath14 depends on the ionization potential of the target atom , meaning that the variations in @xmath57 scaling are atom specific .",
    "we performed calculations for the wavelength - scaling of @xmath40 by single - cycle pulses with @xmath58 , where we chose h and he atoms as targets .",
    "for the h atom , we employ tdse whereas for he the sfa model is used .",
    "to calculate @xmath40 at each value of the laser wavelength @xmath21 , we integrate over the spectral interval 50 - 70 ev for @xmath59 tw/@xmath60 .",
    "[ fig_atom_specific ] shows these results .",
    "@xmath40 shows an overall @xmath61 dependence with @xmath62 .",
    "since the fine - scale oscillations result from cycle - by - cycle interference of the returning electron trajectories , the amplitudes of these fluctuations are commensurate with the number of returning electron trajectories  @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why these fluctuations do not appear in the single - cycle limit in fig .",
    "[ fig_atom_specific ] .",
    "in this report , we studied fine - scale oscillations in the wavelength scaling of harmonic efficiency using few - cycle pulses where the effect of cep is pronounced .",
    "our simulations are based on the numerical solutions of tdse and sfa model .",
    "we found that the fine - scale oscillations in wavelength dependence is cep dependent and therefore can be controlled by phase - stabilization .",
    "next , we employed both tdse and sfa methods to characterize the @xmath21-dependence of the hhg yield in single - cycle limit .",
    "we found that the fluctuations in the hhg yield vanish due to the absence of cycle - by - cycle interference for single - cycle pulses .",
