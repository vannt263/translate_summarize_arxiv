    "these states are separated by the zeeman gap @xmath8 from the ground state and form a band with the width of @xmath9 .",
    "the exciton dispersion law is quadratic at small wave numbers and saturates in a short - wave limit , where the excitons , in fact , transform into free electron - hole pairs @xcite",
    ".    this paper studies the interaction between the spin waves and a magnetic impurity in 2deg . to be more specific ,",
    "we consider doped heterojunctions gaas / gaalas and related materials , so we refer below to a iii - v semiconductor as a host material where some cation atoms are substituted for magnetic transition metal impurities .",
    "it is known @xcite , that transition metal atoms create deep levels in the forbidden energy gap of the host semiconductor , and the main mechanism of the electron - impurity scattering is the resonance scattering by the @xmath10-levels of the unfilled @xmath11 shell of transition metal ions .",
    "the intraatomic exchange interaction leads to the hund rule which governs the occupation of the deep levels . as a result the transition atom in a semiconductor are magnetic .",
    "we will show below that the interplay between the magnetic impurity scattering and attractive electron - hole interaction in excited 2deg results in a bound spin exciton .",
    "the spectrum of these bound states is the subject of the present study .",
    "we start with the model of 2deg doped by magnetic impurities which is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "this model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hamiltonian of a 2deg , strongly quantized by a magnetic field .",
    "it is convenient to use the symmetric cylindrical gauge for the vector potential @xmath14 , so the index @xmath0 describes different orbital states in a given landau level @xmath15    then , assuming a small impurity concentration , the impurity related part @xmath16 of the hamiltonian ( [ 1.1 ] ) can be written in a general form @xmath17 @xmath18 here the state of isolated impurity ion is characterized by a configuration @xmath19 of its unfilled @xmath10-shell in a crystal field preserving the point symmetry of bulk semiconductor ( we assume that the potential , responsible for the confinement in the @xmath20 direction does not disturb the crystalline environment of the impurity site )",

    "the third one represents the short - range substitution potential @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the position of the substitution impurity in a host lattice .",
    "the resonance scattering arises together with the usual `` potential '' scattering due to the fact that the energy level @xmath28 enters the fundamental energy gap of the host semiconductor or appears in the lowest conduction band or the topmost valence band . here",
    "the configuration @xmath29 misses one electron in a state @xmath30 or @xmath31 in comparison with the state @xmath19 .",
    "the impurity problem with the two scattering mechanisms can be solved in the general case @xcite . in our special case",
    "its solutions are essentially different for @xmath32 and @xmath31 channels .",

    "the reason for this difference is in the _ short - range _ nature of both components of the scattering potential .",

    "it is known @xcite that the transition metal impurities follow in their main features the ` aufbau principle ' of the quantum mechanics of isolated atoms .",

    "to conclude , we have found that the magnetic impurity can bind the spin exciton in a 2deg .",
    "it turned out that the mechanism of the exciton capture is the _ spin - selective resonance scattering _ by the deep impurity levels .",
    "this spin selectivity is stems from the hund rule in particular case of transition metal impurities .",
    "the interaction in the second order in scattering potential can be described in terms of an indirect spin exchange @xmath172 ( see eq .",

    "the transversal components of this exchange give the contribution to binding energy only in 4th order in the scattering potential .",
    "it is found that the spin - selective impurity potential is always capable of binding the exciton in a state with the moment @xmath34 because of the threshold van hove singularity of the density of states in a 2deg .",
    "excitons with @xmath36 can be also trapped , but then the conditions for the capture are more severe .",
