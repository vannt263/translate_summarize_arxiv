    "under ambient conditions , amorphous silica ( sio@xmath2 ) forms a disordered tetrahedral network .",
    "tetrahedral units with silicon atoms in the centre are connected to each other via the oxygen atoms at the four corners of each tetrahedron . under compression ,",
    "the network structure of sio@xmath2 may change significantly . from experiments on silica glasses",
    "@xcite , it is known that the sio coordination changes for pressures of the order of 1520gpa . then , the network structure is dominated by five- and six - fold coordinated sio units . albeit of great interest for geoscience ,",
    "experimental studies of pure silica melts under ( high ) pressure are very rare @xcite .",
    "this is due to the high temperatures that are required to study silica in its liquid state .",
    "hence , computer simulations are an important tool to elucidate structural and dynamic properties of silica melts at high pressure .    in many of the recent molecular dynamics ( md ) computer simulations , the pair potential proposed by van beest",
    ", kramer and van santen , the so - called bks potential @xcite , has been used to model the interactions between the si and o ions .",
    "et al _ @xcite showed that in bks silica the oxygen coordination around silicon atoms changes from 4 to 5 at intermediate pressures ( 10 - 15gpa ) and reaches 6 at high pressures .",
    "subsequent studies of bks silica @xcite have indicated that transport processes first become faster with increasing pressure , in agreement with experimental studies on silicate melts @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this was interpreted as a signature of a strong - to - fragile transition , according to angell s classification of glassforming liquids @xcite .",
    "note that the anomalous transport in silica under pressure was already seen in a pioneering md simulation by angell _",
    "et al _ @xcite using a different model potential .",
    "further studies on bks silica @xcite addressed the question to what extent the properties of silica are typical for a strong glassformer , sharing its properties with other network - forming liquids such as water . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the possibility of a phase separation between a low and high density liquid phase was discussed and a rough estimate of the free energy as a function of volume and temperature was used to locate such a transition for bks silica , finding a critical point at a density of about 2.9g/@xmath1 and a temperature of about 2000k .    but recent works have called in question that simulations with simple pair potentials can give reliable results for pressure - induced phenomena in silica . trave _ et al _ @xcite claimed that empirical force fields such as the bks model `` are not sufficiently accurate to reproduce pressure - induced phenomena such as changes in coordination and increasingly strained geometries '' .",
    "these authors used `` first - principles '' car - parrinello molecular dynamics ( cpmd ) simulations to investigate liquid silica for pressures up to about 30gpa at a constant temperature of @xmath3k . in a cpmd ,",
    "the electronic degrees of freedom are taken into account in the framework of a density functional theory @xcite and thus it is not relying on the use of effective interatomic potentials .",
    "whereas the cpmd calculation for silica shows good agreement with respect to the experimental equation of state , the bks model underestimates the experimental specific volume systematically by about 15% . based on cpmd calculations , tangney and scandolo ( ts ) @xcite have developed a new effective potential that nicely reproduces the experimental equation of state of amorphous silica as well as some of the properties of crystalline phases @xcite .",
    "the ts model is a fluctuating dipole moment potential , accounting for the polarizability of the oxygen atoms .",
    "a disadvantage of the ts model is its low efficiency . due to the expensive self - consistent computations of the dipole moments on the oxygen atoms in every time step ,",
    "up to two orders of magnitude more computer time is needed in md simulations with the ts model than for comparable simulations with a simple pair potential such as the bks model @xcite .",
    "the conjecture of trave _ et al _ about the validity of simple effective interaction models for silica has been recently challenged by carr _",
    "et al _ @xcite who developed a new pair potential for silica , the so - called chik potential .",
    "the chik potential was also parametrized from cpmd calculations and was shown to be superior to the bks model with respect to various properties of amorphous silica ( in particular the density at low pressures ) @xcite . in this work , we show that it also reproduces very accurately the experimental equation of state , various structural properties and the anomalous diffusion dynamics of silica under pressure .",
    "this proves the transferability of the chik potential to the description of amorphous silica under high pressure .",
    "thus , the chik model can be used to readdress the questions about the possibility of a liquid - liquid phase separation and the mechanisms of anomalous transport phenomena at high pressures .",
    "at first glance , it might be surprising that the directional covalent bonding in silica can be described by an interaction model that depends only on the magnitude of the distance between atom pairs .",
    "in fact , in a one - component system such as silicon one has to include at least three - body interactions to reproduce a tetrahedral network structure .",
    "however , in a binary system such as silica there is the competition between three different pair potentials . by tuning the parameters for the repulsive oo interactions and the attractive sio interactions appropriately",
    ", one can generate a network structure with si - o tetrahedra as the preferred structural units .",
    ", scaledwidth=65.0% ]    apart from a rather unreliable description of the equation state , the widely used bks potential @xcite has been proven successful to describe various static and dynamic properties of amorphous silica quite reliably ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the parametrization of the bks model was based on hartree - fock calculations of a single sio@xmath4 tetrahedron , charge - saturated by four hydrogen atoms @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that , the development of the chik potential was based on a cpmd simulation of a bulk system of 114 particles .",
    "a structural fitting procedure was used for the parametrization .",
    "the idea was to match the partial pair correlation functions , as obtained with the new effective potential , with those obtained from cpmd .",
    "as the bks potential , the chik model consists of a long - ranged coulomb part and a short - ranged buckingham potential , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the distance between an ion of type @xmath7 and an ion of type @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 is the elementary charge , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are effective partial charges .",

    "the equations of motion were integrated by the velocity form of the verlet algorithm @xcite using a time step of 1.6fs .",
    "the long - range coulomb forces and energies were computed by the ewald summation technique @xcite . at each state , the system was equilibrated in the @xmath28 ensemble during 0.2ns to 25ns .",
    "temperature was kept constant by coupling the system periodically to a stochastic heat bath .",
    "after the equilibration , structural and dynamic quantities were obtained from production runs in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] displays the equation of state , @xmath29 , along different isotherms . for pressures up to about 10gpa , the pressure is almost independent of temperature in the range 4300k@xmath27 2100k .",
    "in this pressure range , the simulation is in very good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates the transferability of the chik model : this model has been parametrized from a single cpmd run at @xmath30k and @xmath31g/@xmath1 , without considering states at high pressure .",

    "a maximum is found around about 3.5g/@xmath1 , corresponding to a pressure of about 20gpa ( see fig .  [",
    "thereby , the diffusivity maximum becomes more pronounced with decreasing temperature .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath80 is closely related to that of the coordination numbers . above about @xmath82gpa , the location of the diffusivity maximum , the number of five - fold coordinated si atoms roughly shows a saturation , while the number of six - fold coordinated si atoms further increases with increasing pressure .",
    "it seems that a sio network with many five - fold coordinated si atoms tends to have a faster diffusion dynamics than one with many six - fold coordinated si atoms .",
    "therefore , for pressures up to about 20gpa the network dynamics is dominated by an increasing number of five - fold coordinated si atoms , leading to an acceleration of diffusion . however , at pressures above about 20gpa , the network dynamics is dominated by an increasing number of sio@xmath71 units , leading to a decrease of the diffusion constants with pressure .",
    "thus , the diffusivity maximum is due to an interplay between five- and six - fold coordinated si atoms .",
    "results of an extensive md simulation have been presented to study structural and dynamic properties of liquid silica under ( high ) pressure . as an interaction potential a simple pair potential , the so - called chik potential ,",
    "was used that leads to a reliable description of the equation of state .",
    "we have shown that the change of the network structure with increasing pressure is related to an anomalous diffusion dynamics , characterized by a diffusivity maximum around 20gpa . elsewhere in this issue",
    "@xcite , a calculation in the framework of mode coupling theory based on the structural input of our simulation is presented that explicitly shows that the changes in the network structure are intimately related to the anomalous transport in amorphous silica .",
    "it is still an open question whether , at low temperatures , there is a first - order phase transition from a low - density to a high - density transition in silica .",
