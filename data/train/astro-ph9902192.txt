    "1995 , bhringer 1995 ) but not inconsistent with similar results for such x - ray luminous groups as for example ngc533 or ngc4104 ( mulchaey et al .",

    "the x - ray emission of the igm can be traced out to about 1 mpc , which turns out to be about the virial radius of the group if we use the total mass value determined from the x - ray observations and the assumption that the virial radius is approximately characterized by the region inside which the mean overdensity is a factor of 200 above the critical density of the universe ( e.g. , evrard et al .",
    "1996 ) .    the fairly spherically symmetric appearance of the group s x - ray halo ( except possibly for some faint outer extensions ) taken together with the perfect consistency of the mass determined from the velocity dispersion and the x - ray properties , and the findings of ledlow et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that the galaxy velocity distribution does not significantly deviate from a gaussian , implies that the matter in the group inside a radius of about 1 mpc is most probably quite relaxed .",

    "such off - sets of cd galaxies have also been observed in a number of other poor systems ( e.g. , awm7 , neumann & bhringer 1995 ; fornax cluster , ikebe et al .",
    "1996 ) and some abell clusters ( e.g. , lazzati & chincarini 1998 ) . in lazzati & chincarini ( 1998 ) ,",
    "this is traced back to a small - amplitude oscillation of the cd galaxy around the bottom of the cluster potential .",
    "the cooling time in the center is @xmath112 yr , i.e. no ` large - scale ' cooling flow is expected to have developed .",
    "further , the enhanced x - ray emission from the direction of ngc383 is consistent with originating from a point source .",
    "we also note that although strong low - ionization optical emission lines have been reported for some central galaxies in cluster cooling flows ( e.g. , cowie et al .",
    "1983 , heckman 1989 , crawford & fabian 1992 ) , the morphology of the ring- or disk - like emission line region in ngc383 ( owen et al .",
    "1990 , fraix - burnet et al .",
    "1991 ) does not argue for a connection to a cooling flow .",

    "( this alone does not exclude the presence of a cooling flow , though , since not all of them are associated with emission line nebulae . )",
    "although 3c31 is only a moderately bright radio galaxy , its jets could be studied in detail due to its proximity .",
    "concerning the origin , morphology and confinement of the jets , several models were explored ( e.g. , blandford & icke 1978 , bridle et al .",
    "1994 , bicknell 1994 ) .",

    "3.3 ) and a temperature of @xmath27=1.5 kev .",
    "whereas in the central region ( i.e. within ngc383 ) , there seems to be a strong overpressure of the radio gas ( but note that there certainly is an additional contribution to thermal pressure from higher - density gas within the galaxy ) , pressure equilibrium is reached at about 35 kpc ( projected distance from the center ) .",
    "further out the thermal pressure increasingly exceeds the nonthermal pressure .",
    "it is interesting to note that bridle et al .",
    "( 1980 ) find the expansion rate of the jets of 3c31 transverse to their length to decrease with increasing distance from the radio core . this may be related to the relative increase of the thermal pressure of the ambient medium with increasing radius .",
    "while bridle s trend refers mainly to the presently in x - rays barely resolved core region it may be interesting to explore this relation further with higher - resolution x - ray data .",
    "a similar comparison of thermal vs. non - thermal pressure was performed in t97 .",
    "they derived a somewhat different surface brightness profile and thus change in thermal pressure with the consequence that the radius where both pressure values are of the same order shifts further out which led them to suggest that ngc383 might have a giant halo that escaped detection in the ( short ) hri exposure .",

    "are usually traced back to the influence of the surroundings , via accretion of gas from the group environment ( e.g. , beuing et al .",

    "the x - ray luminosities generally exceed those expected from a discrete source contribution and the x - ray properties of most galaxies are consistent with the bulk of the x - ray emission arising from the ism of the individual galaxies .",
    "ngc383 is separately discussed in the next section .",
    "the x - ray analysis suggests the presence of two components in the x - ray spectrum of ngc383 : emission from a rs plasma of @xmath4 0.40.7 kev and a second component that was parameterized as powerlaw or second rs contribution .",
    "compact pl emission could originate from an agn or via ssc at the base of the radio jet ; e.g. , jones et al .",

    "the dominant excitation mechanism in liners is still under discussion , but there is growing evidence that the bulk of them is accretion - powered ( e.g. , ho et al . 1998 ) .",
    "owen et al . also briefly mention the presence of a broad emission line component .",
    "alternatively , two - component rs models fit the x - ray spectrum ; a second component may originate from non - perfect correction of the cluster contribution or a temperature range in emission from the ism of the galaxy .",
    "in fact , more than one temperature component is favoured for nearly every early - type galaxy examined in , e.g. , matsushita et al .",

    "( 1997 ) and buote & fabian ( 1998 ) . whereas the hot component is occasionally interpreted in terms of emission from discrete sources ( e.g. , matsushita et al .",

    "1987 ) for the given @xmath95 .    in conclusion ,",
    "although the exact shape and strength of the hard x - ray component can not be determined with present data , its presence and high luminosity suggest as origin emission from an active nucleus in ngc383 .",

    "since the qso is also located very near ( 10 ) to a giant elliptical galaxy at @xmath6=0.111 , which is part of a small group , it remained unclear from which of the three the x - ray emission originated : the qso , the giant elliptical , or the igm of the small group ( stocke et al .",
    "gioia et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , in a deep observation , could not detect x - ray emission in the 0.052 kev band , which they traced back to either variability ( intrinsic to the source , or caused by a microlensing event during the   observation ; which would favour the quasar identification of the x - ray source ) , or a strongly absorbed x - ray spectrum .",
    "the incidental pspc observation of the source was briefly discussed by ciliegi & maccacaro ( 1996 ) in a large sample study of spectra of emss agn .",
    "they applied a powerlaw to the spectrum and found excess absorption .",
    "below , we analyze the x - ray spectral properties in more detail and also perform a timing analysis , in order to get clues on the origin of the x - ray emission ( elliptical galaxy , group or quasar ) .",
    "the hri data improve the position of 1e0104 , but not much , since the source is weak and located near the border of the fov . in fig .",

    "we note , however , that the x - ray source appears to be extended .",
    "although the analysis is complicated by a newly detected closeby second source , a comparison with the x - ray emission from the f star at nearly the same off - axis angle , clearly suggests that the x - ray emission from 1e0104 does not originate from a point source ( see fig . 1 ; the f star is the brightest source at the right border of the image , 1e0104 is the one at the lower border ) .",
    "we do not detect short - time variability during the pspc observation ( fig .",
    "[ light ] ) . to examine the long - term trend , we converted the pspc countrate to hri countrate assuming constant spectral shape .",

    "this yields @xmath122 @xmath69 , = 3.2 and @xmath54 = 1.1 .",
    "alternatively , the spectrum can be successfully described in terms of a rs model . in this case",
    "we used @xmath6=0.111 since rs emission is more likely to originate from the elliptical and/or igm .",
    "if @xmath25 is treated as free parameter it is consistent with @xmath26 but comes with large errors .",
    "we obtain @xmath123 @xmath69 and @xmath124 kev ( @xmath54 = 1.0 ) . for @xmath25=@xmath26 , @xmath27 = 1.9 kev and @xmath125 erg / s .    plugging this temperature into the @xmath126 relation for groups / clusters ( markevitch 1998 ) we predict a ( 0.12.4 kev ) x - ray luminosity of 510@xmath34 erg / s which is of the order of the observed value and thus consistent with an identification of 1e0104 with the igm of the small group .",
    "the x - ray emission of 1e0104 turned out to be constant . in particular",
    ", there is excellent agreement with the flux derived for the   observation ( adopting the same spectral model ) .",

    "we confirm the excess cold absorption in case of the pl description of the x - ray spectrum , not unexpected for a bal quasar , but find an rs model to be similarly successful .",
    "the best - fit parameters of the latter model , which due to its shape would argue for an origin from the group s igm or brightest group elliptical , are well consistent with the known @xmath115-@xmath29 relation of clusters and groups of galaxies , i.e. , with the igm as counterpart .",
    "further , the derived @xmath5 erg / s would be rather high for an elliptical outside a rich cluster environment ( particularly for the observed ( stocke et al .",
    "1984 ) r - magnitude of @xmath127 = 15.1 ) , but usual for the igm .",
    "the hri position is intermediate between the elliptical and the quasar , and consistent with all three identifications .",
    "however , there is evidence that the source emission is extended .    in summary ,",
    "if only one emitter dominates the x - ray flux ( instead of a contribution from _ all three _ potential counterparts , which would strongly complicate matters but can not be excluded ) it seems that the available data ( constancy in source flux , high @xmath115 , fit into @xmath115-@xmath29 relation , evidence for source extent ) favour an identification with the igm of the nearby group at @xmath6=0.111 .",
    "a deep high spatial resolution observation _ centered _ on 1e0104 should finally resolve the counterpart question .",
    "we have presented a study of the x - ray properties of the ngc383 group of galaxies , extending the work of t97 , and of the source 1e0104 + 3135 .",
    "the properties of the intra - group medium derived from the pspc observation are summarized in tab .",
    "3 . the x - ray emission of the igm can be traced out to about @xmath128 mpc , which turns out to be about the virial radius of the group .",
    "several lines of evidence were presented that the group inside this radius is quite relaxed . with the given depth of the pspc observations we can therefore characterize the entire galaxy system as far as it has approached a dynamical equilibrium state . for this part of the group we find a total mass of @xmath1 m@xmath2 and a gas mass fraction of 21% .",
    "the latter value is at the upper end of the distribution for groups .",
    "the result implies that the gravitational potential of the group is deep enough to prevent a majour gas loss , in contrast to less massive groups ( davis et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the surface brightness profile is characterized by a slope parameter @xmath129 which is shallower than for most of the galaxy clusters but a quite common value for groups .",
    "the temperature of @xmath3 kev found for the igm is well consistent with the @xmath130 relation giving further support to the picture that the group is a well relaxed and normal system .    with an estimated central cooling time larger than the hubble time",
    "no central cooling flow is expected and no signature for it is found neither in the spatial and spectral x - ray data nor in the optical spectrum .",
    "we also discussed the x - ray properties of the well - studied radio galaxy 3c31 which is located near the center of the extended x - ray emission .",
    "if one wishes to avoid excessively depleted metal abundances , the spectrum of 3c31 is best described by a two - component model , consisting of a low - temperature rs component and a hard tail ( pl or second rs ) , confirming t97 .",
    "the soft component contributes with @xmath131 erg / s to the total x - ray luminosity of @xmath132 erg / s ( assuming metal abundances of 0.35@xmath22solar ) .",
    "no temporal variability in the x - ray flux is detected .",
    "x - ray emission from the direction of the interesting source 1e0104 + 3135 , by chance located in the field of view , was analyzed .",
    "one scenario ( transient brightening of the @xmath6=2 bal qso0104 + 3135 due to lensing during the earlier  observation ) turned out to be unlikely . besides an absorbed powerlaw , the spectrum of 1e0104 can be described by a raymond - smith model with @xmath4 2 kev resulting in an intrinsic luminosity of @xmath5 erg / s at @xmath6=0.111 .",
    "although no potential counterpart ( qso , nearby elliptical galaxy or igm of the small group to which the elliptical belongs ) can be safely ruled out at present , there are several hints ( constancy in source flux , high @xmath115 , consistency with @xmath115-@xmath29 relation for groups / clusters , evidence for source extent ) for an identification of the x - ray source with the igm of the nearby group of galaxies at @xmath6=0.111 .",
