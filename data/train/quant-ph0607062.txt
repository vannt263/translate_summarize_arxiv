    "compared to qubits , higher - dimensional quantum systems improve performance of many protocols and algorithms of quantum information processing .",
    "for example , additionally to their increased capacity , they make quantum cryptography more secure @xcite , or lead to a greater reduction of communication complexity @xcite",
    ". one way to deal with a qudit is to find a convenient physical system representing it .",
    "a beautiful example is a photon with many accessible propagation paths @xcite .",
    "another approach , studied here , is to treat many systems of lower dimensions as a global higher - dimensional object  a composite qudit .",
    "the challenge is to prepare and operate on entangled states of subsystems and to experimentally realize all global observables .",
    "this usually requires difficult conditional operations .    the preparation of entangled states ( at least some of them ) is well within a reach of current technology .",
    "for example , entanglement of two photons , in all degrees of freedom , was demonstrated in ref .",
    "each of these photons can be regarded as a composite qudit , with subsystems represented by different degrees of freedom .",
    "further , a system of two photons can be thought of as an even higher dimensional qudit .    here , measurements on such qudits are studied .",
    "some examples are already proposed and realized in a context of bell s theorem @xcite .",
    "the present paper is a generalization of that work .",
    "first , the requirements for an arbitrary global observable are given .",
    "next , a specific class of operators , unitary generalizations of pauli operators @xcite , is described in detail .",
    "the importance of this class comes from its applications .",
    "for example , the operators form a full tomographic set ( allow for a reconstruction of a density matrix ) , appear in quantum cryptography @xcite , or tests of local realism @xcite . a solution to the eigenproblem of these operators",
    "is constructed in full generality and , for a two - component case , the schmidt representation of the eigenstates is derived .",
    "all the eigenvectors are shown to have the same schmidt number .",
    "thus , the sets of entangled and disentangled eigenbases are identified , which respectively define the sets of `` more difficult '' and `` easier '' realizable operators . a beautiful method to solve the eigenproblem of the generalized pauli operators , based on euclid s algorithm , was given by nielsen _",
    "however , since their interests were different , they did not present an explicit solution .",
    "the generalized pauli operators have been studied in various levels of detail in many other papers .",
    "nevertheless , the present author could not find a general form of the eigenbasis . here ,",
    "an explicit compact formulae for eigenvectors and eigenvalues are given , as well as a practical procedure how to compute them .",
    "although unitary , the generalized pauli operators are measurable . in quantum mechanics , different outcomes of a measurement apparatus",
    "correspond to different orthogonal states of a system . due to the fact that most often measurement outcomes are expressed in form of real numbers we are used to connect hermitian operators with observables . however , there are measurement apparatuses which _ do not _ output a number .",
    "take a device which clicks if a photon is detected or a bunch of such photo - detectors which monitor many possible propagation paths of a photon .",
    "the operator associated with this apparatus has a specific spectral decomposition ( different clicks find the system in different orthogonal states ) .",
    "however , the eigenvalues assigned to the clicks can be arbitrary , as long as the assignment is consistent , i.e. clicks of the same detector always reveal the same eigenvalue .",
    "if one finds it useful to work with complex eigenvalues , as it is often the case when considering higher - dimensional quantum systems , one can use operators which are unitary , with eigenvalues given by the complex roots of unity .    with any generalized pauli operator one can associate a measurement device capable to measure it .",
    "we present such devices for polarisation - path qudits , and prove that quantum cryptography with two bases is relatively easy to realize as it does not require any joint measurements on the subsystems . as the unitary operators correspond to certain measurement apparatuses , they will be often called `` observables '' .",
    "consider a qudit composed of many subsystems , possibly of different dimensions .",
    "the measurement of any global observable can be viewed as a unitary evolution of the whole system which transforms the eigenvectors of the observable into the eigenvectors which can be distinguished by the measurement apparatus . for subsystems of equal dimensions",
    "arbitrary global unitary operation can be decomposed into local and two - body conditional operations @xcite .",
    "this proof can be almost directly applied to the problem studied here , and it will not be repeated .",
    "individual measurements , local and conditional two - body operations are sufficient to realize any global measurement on a composite qudit .    instead of finding the evolution , one can decompose a global observable into ( possibly joint ) measurements on subsystems and classical communication .",
    "eigenbases of individual measurements form a product basis in a global hilbert space .",
    "eigenvectors of any global observable can be decomposed in this basis .",
    "if the eigenvectors factorize , that is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a state of subsystem @xmath2 , then there are two possible scenarios : ( a ) a global measurement can be performed with individual measurements on separate subsystems , ( b ) it can be done with an additional use of a feed - forward technique , i.e. a subsequent measurement setting depends on the outcomes of all previous measurements . to see this , note that orthogonality of vectors @xmath3 implies certain orthogonalities of the states of subsystems , @xmath4 . in the simplest case , for each subsystem the vectors @xmath4 form a basis .",
    "then , the first scenario , ( a ) , can be applied .",
    "the other possibility is that vectors , say @xmath5 , form an orthogonal basis , and for every @xmath5 one has a _ different _ set of orthogonal vectors of another subsystem , say @xmath6 , and so on . in this case ,",
    "one first measures the particle the states of which span the full basis ( in our case subsystem `` 0 '' ) .",
    "next , depending on the outcome , another subsystem is measured in a suitable basis .",
    "further on , depending on both previous outcomes , yet another subsystem is measured , etc .",
    "this is what is called feed - forward technique , ( b ) .",
    "if some eigenstates of a multisystem observable do not factorize , joint measurements are necessary to measure it .",
    "in any case , the realisation of a global observable is based on the solution of its eigenproblem . here , a general solution to the eigenproblem of the generalized pauli operators is presented .    in the hilbert - schmidt space of operators acting on vectors in a hilbert space of dimension @xmath7 ,",
    "one can always find a basis set of @xmath8 unitary operators .",
    "it has been shown that one can construct such a set using the following relation @xcite : @xmath9 where the action of the two operators on the right - hand side , on the eigenvectors of @xmath10 operator , @xmath11 , is defined by : @xmath12 with @xmath13 the number @xmath14 is a primitive complex @xmath7th root of unity , whereas the addition , here @xmath15 , is taken modulo @xmath7 . unless explicitly stated all additions",
    "are taken modulo @xmath7 .",
    "the operators @xmath16 are called generalized pauli operators as for @xmath17 they reduce to standard pauli operators .",
    "they share some features with them @xcite .",
    "the matrix of any @xmath16 , written in the @xmath10 basis , has only @xmath7 non - vanishing entries , one per column and row : @xmath18 the only non - vanishing element of the first column , a `` 1 '' , appears in the @xmath19th row ( recall that @xmath20 ) .",
    "generally , the matrix elements of @xmath16 operator , @xmath21_{rm}$ ] , are given by @xmath21_{rm } = \\delta_{r - k , m } \\alpha_d^{ml}$ ] , where @xmath22 is the kronecker delta .",
    "since every @xmath16 is unitary it can be diagonalized : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a unitary matrix the columns of which are eigenstates of @xmath16 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is a diagonal matrix with entries being eigenvalues of @xmath16 , denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "the form of @xmath21_{rm}$ ] and ( [ diagonalization ] ) imply conditions , which must be satisfied by the eigenvectors @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the element of the matrix @xmath24 in the @xmath31th row and @xmath32th column , i.e. the @xmath31th coefficient of the eigenvector @xmath28 .",
    "a study of this condition allows one to construct the eigenbasis .",
    "we first present the result , that is give a candidate for an eigenbasis , and then prove that this is indeed the eigenbasis . depending on @xmath19 ,",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath16 are given by superposition of different number of states @xmath11 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath33 the greatest common divisor of @xmath19 and @xmath7",
    ". within this definition @xmath34 is a multiple of @xmath33 . the eigenstates @xmath3 involve every @xmath33th state of the @xmath10 basis : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and of course @xmath38 . both @xmath39 and @xmath40 enumerate different states @xmath11 into which @xmath3",
    "is decomposed , i.e. @xmath41 . all other coefficients vanish .",
    "the whole eigenbasis splits into @xmath33 groups of eigenvectors which are superpositions of vectors @xmath42 with fixed @xmath43 .",
    "there are @xmath44 eigenvectors within each group . to uniquely identify the eigenvector @xmath3 one needs to specify @xmath43 , and additionally an integer @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 . with these definitions we can present the form of eigenvectors ( a candidate ) : @xmath47 where generally the eigenvalues @xmath48 are given by : @xmath49 and",
    "@xmath50 is a phase factor common to all the eigenvalues .",
    "one can consider an operator @xmath51 .",
    "] we will show below how to compute this phase .",
    "note that the coefficients in ( [ eigenvectors ] ) are independent of @xmath43 .",
    "this can be intuitively explained by noting that for different @xmath43 s the eigenvectors @xmath52 are orthogonal just due to the fact that they involve orthogonal vectors @xmath53 . for a fixed @xmath43 , but different @xmath54 s , the vectors ( [ eigenvectors ] ) are also orthogonal .",
    "their scalar product @xmath55 involves the product of @xmath56 , and the whole sum is equal to kronecker delta @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the vectors @xmath58 form an orthonormal basis .    to prove that this basis is the eigenbasis one needs to check whether @xmath59 the action of @xmath16 , defined by ( [ s_definition ] ) , on the state @xmath52 is given by : @xmath60 changing the summation index to @xmath61",
    "one finds : @xmath62 the coefficients within the sum are equal to the coefficients of the initial @xmath58 state if for the last term in ( [ s_j ] ) , for which @xmath63 , one has : @xmath64 this equation gives the eigenvalues @xmath65 .",
    "if one takes one of the solutions to ( [ compute_eigenvalues ] ) , say @xmath66 , in the form @xmath67 , then the remaining solutions are given by @xmath68 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath66 satisfies ( [ compute_eigenvalues ] ) , then also @xmath65 satisfy it .",
    "the eigenvalues for other @xmath43 s are given by : @xmath69 note that degeneracies in the eigenproblem can only appear for @xmath70 .",
    "( since for @xmath71 one has only @xmath72 , and @xmath54 takes all @xmath7 different values ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath16 operator are rotated in the complex plane by @xmath50 from the complex roots of unity . if one puts @xmath73 to be some power of @xmath14 , from eq .",
    "( [ compute_eigenvalues ] ) this power is given by @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the eigenvalues of operator @xmath75 are rotated back to the complex roots of unity , which can be a useful property .",
    "practically , to compute the eigenvectors one should find the value of @xmath33 . if it is different than unity , set @xmath72 and compute the coefficients according to eq .",
    "( [ eigenvectors ] ) . for other values of @xmath43",
    "the coefficients are the same , but now they multiply orthogonal vectors @xmath53 .",
    "to compute the eigenvalues of @xmath16 one needs to solve eq .",
    "( [ compute_eigenvalues ] ) .",
    "it has the following solutions : @xmath76 ; the other eigenvalues for @xmath72 are obtained by multiplication of @xmath77 ; the eigenvalues for @xmath78 can be found from ( [ lambda_a_def ] ) .    _",

    "one has @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) . according to ( [ lambda_a_def ] ) ,",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath85 are equal to @xmath86 .",
    "this can be summarized in the eigenbasis : @xmath87 two - component system --------------------    consider measurements of the generalized pauli operators on a system composed of two subsystems , of dimension @xmath88 .",
    "the subsystems are described in hilbert spaces of dimensions @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we first present a parameterization of states of subsystems into which the eigenvectors are decomposed , and next utilize it to describe the structure of the eigenbases .",
    "it is proven that all of the eigenvectors are either entangled or disentangled .",
    "thus , one identifies the operators which can be measured on individual subsystems ( with additional feed - forward ) , and those which require joint measurements .",
    "recall that , according to eq .",
    "( [ states_involved ] ) , each eigenvector @xmath58 involves every @xmath33th state of the @xmath10 basis , @xmath91 , with @xmath92 . in turn , each of these states can be written in terms of subsystems , using base-@xmath93 representation : @xmath94 where @xmath95_{d_0}$ ] ( the symbol @xmath96_{d_0}$ ] denotes @xmath97 modulo @xmath90 ) , and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 denotes an integer part of @xmath97 .",
    "the number of distinct states of subsystem `` 0 '' is given by the number of different values of @xmath100 . since other values of @xmath43",

    "thus , one can write @xmath103 . the integers @xmath104 and @xmath90 can have common factors , and the fraction @xmath105 may be simplified to an irreducible form @xmath106 .",

    "take as an example @xmath223 operator in the form @xmath224 .",
    "its eigenstates are given by : @xmath225 to distinguish between these states one needs to build an interferometer like the one in the fig .",

    "this setup , which measures the operator @xmath226 ( with @xmath227 ) , distinguishes maximally entangled states of paths and polarisations .",
    "first , with the @xmath204 phase shift ( ps(@xmath215 ) ) and the beam - splitter ( bs ) , the @xmath211 eigenstates are converted into @xmath228 eigenstates . next , the @xmath229 phase ( ps(@xmath229 ) ) is applied in the lower arm , where @xmath218 is directed . in the upper arm polarization",

    "a method of construction of qudits , studied here , is to compose them of other , lower dimensional , subsystems .",
    "in such a case , if a global observable has some entangled eigenvectors , its measurement naturally requires joint actions on subsystems .",
    "if eigenvectors factorize , the observable is measurable individually , sometimes with an additional feed - forward .",
    "thus , in order to design a setup capable to measure an observable , its eigenproblem must be solved .    here",
    ", the eigenproblem of the unitary generalizations of pauli operators is solved , for arbitrary dimensions , and schmidt decomposition of the eigenvectors , for qudits composed of two components , is derived . using these results quantum cryptography with two bases , operating on a two - component qudit ,",
