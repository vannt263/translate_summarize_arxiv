    "in this paper , we consider the convected helmholtz equation in the presence of a mean flow .",
    "this equation is generated from the linearized euler equations by reducing it for the pressure field to describe a propagating wave to the mean flow ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so it has been applied in sciences and engineering problems , for instance , in aeroacoustics ( @xcite ) . in addition , various studies have been devoted as follows : bcache @xmath0 used perfectly marched layers for the convected helmholtz equation to design efficient numerical absorbing boundary conditions in @xcite .",
    "casenave @xmath0 in @xcite computed a linear acoustic wave propagation at a fixed frequency in the presence of flow using the coupled bem - fem .",
    "an algebraic subgrid scale finite element method was presented by guasch @xmath0 to improve the accuracy of the galerkin finite element solution in @xcite .",
    "however , issues concerning the dispersion properties of the finite element method remain unsolved yet .",
    "the dispersion relation concerns the angular frequency of a wave to the wavenumber and the mach number . from this relation",
    "the phase and group velocities of the wave are derived .",
    "sometimes they lead instabilities due to the opposite signs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence the dispersion analysis is an important issue . for the helmholtz equation ,",
    "there are numerous studies concerning the dispersion properties .",
    "harari @xmath0 in @xcite used the galerkin least squares to solve the helmholtz equation and @xcite developed the generalized finite element method .",
    "other approaches are appending the element boundary residuals to the galerkin approximation in @xcite and the nonconforming element in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze the numerical dispersion behaviors of the convected helmholtz equation using the conforming and nonconforming finite element methods .",
    "particularly , we investigate the difference of the continuous and numerical angular frequencies @xmath1 and fine that it relates to the numerical errors .",
    "let us consider the convected helmholtz equation in a uniform mean flow on the domain @xmath2 : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 for the mach number @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a @xmath7 diagonal matrix with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "next we will investigate the dispersion relations by the conforming and nonconforming finite element methods using quadrilateral elements of the lowest order .",
    "in particular , two numerical schemes are used : p1 conforming ( p1-c ) method , rannacher - turek nonconforming ( rt - nc ) method . here , there are two types of rt elements .",

    "similarly , we denote @xmath32 the basis function at @xmath22 for @xmath33 , for examples , @xmath34 . using these basis functions @xmath32 of rt1-nc method , the numerical solution @xmath17 is represented by @xmath35 for constants @xmath36 . inserting @xmath17 and @xmath25 into and using the middle point rule to approximate the inner products on the boundary",

    "this means that p1-c method is more efficient than rt - nc method for small @xmath60 and large @xmath5 , though it does not for other cases .",
