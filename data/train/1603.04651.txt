    "the area of circuit quantum electrodynamics ( circuit qed ) offers unprecedented possibilities to manipulate _ in situ _ the properties of mesoscopic systems composed of superconducting artificial atoms interacting with the electromagnetic field inside the waveguide resonator on a chip @xcite . along with practical application for quantum information processing ( qip ) this solid - state architecture",
    "also allows for the experimental study of some of the most fundamental physical processes , such as the light ",
    "matter interaction at the level of a few photons . due to",
    "the relative ease to achieve the _ strong coupling regime _ , in which the coherent light ",
    "matter coupling rate is much larger than the system damping and dephasing rates @xcite , this setup can probe novel phenomena with tiny coupling rates .",
    "one example is the implementation of the _ dynamical casimir effect _ ( dce ) and associated phenomena using actively controlled artificial atoms , which may serve both as the source and the detector of modulation - induced radiation @xcite .",
    "we recall that dce is a common name ascribed to the processes in which photons are generated from vacuum due to the external time - variation of boundary conditions for some field @xcite . for the usual electromagnetic case this corresponds to the fast motion of a mirror or modulation of the dielectric properties of the mirror / intracavity medium @xcite .",
    "analogs of dce were recently verified experimentally in the setups resembling a single - mirror @xcite and a lossy cavity @xcite , where the modulation of the boundary conditions was achieved by threading a time - dependent magnetic flux through squids ( superconductive quantum interference devices ) located inside the coplanar waveguide .",
    "these experiments stimulated new theoretical research on role of dynamical casimir physics in quantum - information processing , quantum simulations and engineering of nonclassical states of light and matter @xcite .",
    "recent studies have indicated that dce could be implemented even using a single two - level atom ( qubit ) with time - dependent parameters , such as the transition frequency or the atom  field coupling strength @xcite .",
    "generation of excitation from vacuum occurs due to the counter - rotating terms in the rabi hamiltonian , which for many years had been neglected under the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "moreover , single - atom dce carries some new characteristics , such as the atom  field entanglement , saturation in the number of created photons ( due to intrinsic nonlinearities associated with non - harmonic spectrum of the composite system ) and emergence of additional resonant modulation frequencies @xcite . since the ultra - strong coupling regime @xcite ( for which the atom  field coupling rate is comparable to the cavity and atomic frequencies )",
    "is experimentally demanding , especially in nonstationary configurations , here we assume moderate values of the coupling strength , which in turn imply small transition rates for the phenomena originating from the counter - rotating terms .",
    "hence the dissipation must be sufficiently weak and the frequency of modulation must be tuned with a high precision , typically of the order of @xmath0 khz for modulation frequencies in the ghz range , that ultimately should be determined experimentally or numerically . for the harmonic modulation of system parameters",
    "the observable quantities , e. g. , the average photon number or the atomic excitation probability , exhibit a oscillating behavior as function of time @xcite .",
    "therefore the duration of modulation must also be minutely adjusted to grasp a meaningful amount of excitations , since the detection is typically carried out when the modulation has ceased .    in this paper",
    "we propose a simple scheme to implement the phenomena induced by the counter - rotating terms that does not require an accurate knowledge of the resonance frequencies and is little sensitive to the duration of the perturbation .",
    "our method is based on the _ adiabatic _ variation of the modulation frequency of the atomic level splitting through the expected resonance , when one can steadily create excitations from vacuum and other initial states without the aforementioned sporadic comebacks of the system to the initial state .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood in terms of some effective two- or multi - level hamiltonians with constant nondiagonal couplings , dependent on the modulation depths , and time - dependent diagonal terms , which are responsible for _ landau - zener processes_.    by the way , landau - zener transitions @xcite are a very fundamental phenomenon , since they occur every time a two - level system is subjected to a time - dependent hamiltonian whose bare energies change with time and cross at some instant of time . in its original form , lz model is characterized by bare energies changing linearly in time .",
    "over the years , the original scheme has been extended in several directions : non linear time - dependence of the diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian @xcite , multilevel systems , even with n - fold crossings @xcite , and , of course , including environmental effects inducing dissipation and decoherence @xcite .",
    "this ubiquitous model has been applied to describe similar dynamical situations in several physical scenarios .",
    "for example , it has been useful in such systems as spinorial bose - einstein condensates @xcite , josephson junctions @xcite , in optical lattices with cold atoms @xcite , and even  in its modified version know as hidden crossing model @xcite  in classical optics @xcite .",
    "also in the context of circuit qed , landau - zener tunneling has been extensively used to suitably manipulate the state of a single qubit @xcite . in our case",
    ", landau - zener processes naturally rise from the fact that the frequency sweep allows realizing a series of resonances between the ( time - varying frequency ) external perturbation and a series of couples of the rabi - hamiltonian eigenstates .",
    "one possible downside of our method is the relatively long implementation times .",
    "nonetheless , we demonstrate that it can work with the current dissipative parameters provided the modulation depth of the atomic transition frequency is of the order of a few percent of its bare value . besides",
    ", we show that the states generated from vacuum can be quite different from the squeezed vacuum state ( svs ) that is typically generated for strictly harmonic modulations @xcite , so our scheme may find new applications in qip .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec1 ]",
    "we deduce the effective hamiltonians similar to the landau - zener physics in the resonant and dispersive regimes of atom  field interaction . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe our approach to realistically account for the dissipation , with thorough numerical analysis carried out in section [ sec3 ] . finally , in section [ sec4 ] we discuss the obtained results and present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a single qubit in nonstationary circuit qed .",
    "our starting point is the hamiltonian ( we set @xmath1)@xmath2where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are cavity annihilation and creation operators and @xmath5 is the photon number operator ; @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the atomic ladder operators , where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) denotes the atomic ground ( excited ) state .",
    "@xmath11 is the cavity frequency , @xmath12 is the atomic transition frequency and @xmath13 is the atom  field coupling strength . for the sake of simplicity here",
    "we consider the external modulation of the atomic transition frequency as @xmath14 $ ] , although it was shown that for @xmath15 the weak modulation of any system parameter produces similar results . in this work",
    "we suppose that the modulation frequency @xmath16 may also slowly change as function of time . it will be shown that in specific regimes we obtain the two - level or multi - level effective landau - zener physics , so initially unpopulated system states can be excited without undergoing oscillations back to the initial state .    for @xmath17 and @xmath18 we can treat the external modulation as a perturbation that drives the transitions between the bare eigenstates of the rabi hamiltonian , @xmath19 , where@xmath20and @xmath21 increases with the index @xmath22 . expanding the wavefunction corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) as@xmath23the probability amplitudes obey the coupled differential equations@xmath24thus one can induce the coherent coupling between the rabi dressed states @xmath25 by setting the modulation frequency roughly equal to @xmath26 .",
    "the remaining rapidly oscillating terms can be neglected according to the rwa approach , which sets the criteria for the validity of the resulting effective equations .",
    "in addition , the rwa method introduces small intrinsic frequency shifts in the final equations , which slightly alter the resonant modulation frequency @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of the present scheme is that such frequency shifts are completely irrelevant for the experimental implementation .    for the weak qubit ",

    ". therefore the lowest order eigenvalues and eigenstates derived above are sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the essence of our proposal is most clearly seen in specific regimes of the system parameters , as illustrated below for the resonant and dispersive regimes .",
    "first we consider the _ resonant regime _ , @xmath49 , and assume a small number of excitations , @xmath50 .",
    "for the initial system ground state @xmath51 and the modulation frequency @xmath52one can show [ by neglecting the rapidly oscillating terms in equation ( kiko ) ] that to the lowest order in @xmath32 the dynamics is described by the effective hamiltonian@xmath53here we defined the complex modulation depth @xmath54 and @xmath55 is a small time - dependent function , @xmath56 , to be specified later .",

    "when @xmath60 is a linear function of time the equation ( vortex ) describes the standard two - level landau - zener problem , so for adiabatic variation of @xmath61 across the avoided - crossing one can transfer steadily the population from the initial state @xmath51 to the final one @xmath62 . for the linear variation of @xmath61 from @xmath63 to @xmath64",
    "the probability of such transition is @xmath65 , which is close to one provided we have @xmath66 .",
    "however , the equation ( [ vortex ] ) is only valid for small values of @xmath67 , so our scheme corresponds to the finite duration landau - zener sweeps in which we have @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is of the order of @xmath70 .",
    "nonetheless , as shown later , in this way we can achieve the desired transition with sufficiently high probability and compensate for the ignorance in the knowledge of the exact eigenvalues of the system hamiltonian .",
    "the _ dispersive regime _ is defined as @xmath71 for all relevant values of @xmath41 , and we also assume the standard condition @xmath72 . repeating the above reasoning one finds that for the initial ground state and the modulation frequency@xmath73the interaction - picture effective hamiltonian reads@xmath74@xmath75where @xmath76 , being the sign of @xmath77 .",
    "thus one can achieve the steady population transfer from @xmath51 to @xmath78 , which corresponds approximately to the transition @xmath79 .",

    "if @xmath86 we get the multi - level  landau - zener problem , in which one can couple several dressed states @xmath87 at each avoided - crossing ( although the avoided crossings for different pairs of levels do not coincide exactly ) , so one can asymptotically create several photons from the initial vacuum state @xmath88 .",
    "our approach is not limited to the initial ground state .",

    "we do not aim to develop a microscopic _ ab initio _ model for dissipation in nonstationary systems , instead we assess whether the effective landau - zener transitions discussed in the previous section could be implemented in real circuit qed architectures .",
    "so we use the simplest consistent dissipation approaches available in the literature to evaluate numerically the dynamics during the timescales of interest .",
    "we consider independent reservoirs for different processes , such as dissipation and pure dephasing .",

    "as expected , the dissipation strongly affects the dynamics , since excitations are lost to the environment from the very beginning and the slow modulation is unable to create additional excitations . to confirm the selective landau - zener sweeps between the states",
    "@xmath223 in [ fig5]c and [ fig5]d we show the time evolution of the probabilities @xmath224 , which change one at a time from the initial value to roughly zero ( @xmath225 also undergoes fast oscillations due to the dispersive exchange of excitations between the field and the qubit ) . for @xmath226 the probabilities @xmath227 are not affected by the perturbation , since the corresponding avoided - crossings are not swept during the frequency variation ( for the frequency change in the opposite directions , @xmath228 , only the states with @xmath229 would be affected ) .",
    "although under dissipation the occurrence of the landau - zener transitions is almost completely washed out in the behavior of @xmath154 ( figure [ fig5]a ) , the atomic excitation probability @xmath142 still preserves the characteristic landau - zener plateaus , which are transformed into peaks due to the damping ( figure [ fig5]b ) .",
    "in this work we have discussed a simple scheme to achieve photon generation from vacuum due to the counter - rotating terms in a time - dependent rabi hamiltonian , where a suitable perturbation characterized by a sinusoidal time dependence with a slowly changing frequency is present . because of this frequency change the perturbation intercepts several resonance frequencies of the system ( described by the time - independent rabi hamiltonian ) and can induce a single or a series of landau - zener processes that allow for populating the upper levels starting from the ground state .",
    "this scheme then works quite well without the need to know accurately the resonant unperturbed frequencies of the system nor accurately adjusting the shape of the modulation frequency . besides , it is only little sensitive to the duration of the external perturbation .",
    "the latter property is related to the fact that , provided the diabatic energies ( i.e. , the diagonal rabi - basis matrix elements ) in the effective hamiltonians vary in a sufficiently wide range and with a sufficiently low speed , each landau - zener process essentially leads to the same final result , irrespectively of the specific range and speed .",
    "it is worth noting that although we considered the modulation of the atomic transition frequency , our method can easily be extended to the time - variation of the atom - field coupling strength , or both .",
    "moreover , the effective hamiltonians deduced here are valid for arbitrary variation of the modulation frequency .",
    "so our results can be employed to propose protocols that optimize , for instance , the photon production or generation of specific entangled states , although in these cases one would need a precise knowledge of the system spectrum and to control accurately the duration of the perturbation .",
    "we showed that the effective landau - zener transitions could be implemented for current parameters of dissipation provided one maintains the modulation for a time interval of the order of microseconds with relative modulation strength of a few percent .",
    "for consistent description of the experimental results the dissipation must be necessarily included because it alters significantly the unitary behavior due to the additional transitions between the system eigenstates induced by the combined action of dissipation and coherent perturbation .",
    "it is remarkable that the predictions of the phenomenological quantum optical master equation are qualitatively similar to the predictions of the microscopic dressed - picture master equation , and in many situations both predictions are almost indistinguishable ( this is typical in the weak damping limit ) .",
    "this means that one can use the simpler phenomenological master equation to get a crude estimation about the overall behavior .",
    "the effect of random fluctuations of the modulation frequency can be incorporated into our approach as additional pure dephasing , so one does not expect major qualitative differences in this case . therefore we hope that our protocol will facilitate the hitherto missing experimental observation of dce due to a single qubit",

    "<S> we consider the dissipative single - qubit circuit qed architecture in which the atomic transition frequency undergoes a weak external time - modulation . for sinusoidal modulation with linearly varying frequency </S>",
    "<S> we derive effective hamiltonians that resemble the landau - zener problem of finite duration associated to a two- or multi - level systems . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding off - diagonal coupling coefficients originate either from the rotating or the counter - rotating terms in the rabi hamiltonian , depending on the values of the modulation frequency . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that in the dissipationless case one can accomplish almost complete transitions between the eigenstates of the bare rabi hamiltonian even for relatively short duration of the frequency sweep . to assess the experimental feasibility of our scheme we solved numerically the phenomenological and the microscopic quantum master equations in the markovian regime at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> both models exhibit qualitatively similar behavior and indicate that photon generation from vacuum via effective landau - zener transitions could be implemented with the current technology on the timescales of a few microseconds . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , unlike the harmonic dynamical casimir effect implementations , our proposal does not require the precise knowledge of the resonant modulation frequency to accomplish meaningful photon generation . </S>"
