    "the derived intensities of the fir lines are not very sensitive to the accuracy of this extrapolation since they are formed in lte ( see below ) .",
    "collisional transitions between vibrational levels are not important due to the low density and the short radiative lifetimes .    the kinetic gas temperature is calculated in a self - consistent way , using the derived level populations , by solving the energy balance equation ( e.g. goldreich & scoville 1976 ) ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the adiabatic index , @xmath22 the number density of molecular hydrogen which is the most abundant species in the cse , @xmath23 the terminal gas expansion velocity , @xmath24 the boltzmann constant , @xmath25 the total heating rate per unit volume , and @xmath26 the total cooling rate per unit volume .    the first term on the right - hand - side in the energy balance equation is the cooling due to the adiabatic expansion of the gas .",
    "the adiabatic index , i.e. the ratio of the specific heats @xmath27 , can be assumed to be 5/3 since h@xmath17 can be treated as a ` mono - atomic gas ' .",
    "this is true as long as the corrections on @xmath21 due to rotational excitation of h@xmath17 are small .",
    "these corrections are important for temperatures greater than approximately @xmath28 , i.e. for the innermost regions where @xmath21=7/5 ( goldreich & scoville 1976 ) .",
    "according to our tests , the effect of a varied adiabatic index ( in comparison to a constant one ) is only a few percent in the intensities , which is in agreement with the result of groenewegen ( 1994 ) .",
    "additional cooling is provided by emission from the molecules co and h@xmath17 .",
    "the molecular cooling due to co ( @xmath0co and @xmath1co ) is calculated from the derived level populations using the expression of crosas & menten @xcite . for h@xmath17",

    "1996 ) , but groenewegen @xcite demonstrates that hcn cooling is only of minor importance . in the present version of the code hcn cooling is therefore not included .",
    "the heating is assumed to be dominated by dust - gas collisions ( groenewegen 1994 ) and the photoelectric effect ( crosas & menten 1997 ) . in the former case",
    "a number of free parameters describing the dust are introduced .",
    "these are highly uncertain but affect the derived line intensities . here",
    "we assume that the @xmath29-parameter , i.e. , the efficiency of momentum transfer , to be equal to 0.03 , and define a new parameter that contains the other dust parameters , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the gas - to - dust ratio , @xmath32 is the dust density , and @xmath33 the mean size of the dust particles .",
    "the normalised values are the ones we used to fit the co line emission of using our model ( see schier et al . in prep . ) .",
    "heating ( or cooling ) due to a temperature difference ( heat exchange ) between the dust and the gas could affect the derived temperature structure of the gas and hence the line intensities , especially in the inner parts where the coupling between dust and gas is high .",

    "the period - luminosity relation for c - stars ( groenewegen & whitelock 1996 ) gives a luminosity of 8770l@xmath35 . using this luminosity and the apparent bolometric flux we arrive at a distance of @xmath36 , a value in agreement with the ones discussed recently in the literature .",
    "the stellar temperature is set to @xmath37@xmath38 , a value typical for c - stars with a high mass loss rate ( e.g. , le bertre 1997 ) .",
    "however , the mass loss rate derived is quite insensitive to the choice of @xmath39 , since radiative excitation is of very little importance in this case .",
    "the reason is that , as our calculations show , in this high - density cse the populations in the co rotational levels are determined by collisions , and hence the kinetic temperature , out to a few@xmath310@xmath40 cm ( fig .",
    "[ model ] ) .",
    "consequently , the light variability of the object is also unimportant for the excitation . in the present version of our code",
    "only the star provides radiation since no thermal emission from dust in the cse is included",
    ". this latter radiation could be significant for pumping vibrational states , leading to non - thermal level populations of the rotational states which could effect the fir line intensities , but this effect is judged to be small in this high - density cse .",
    "we assume a spherically symmetric cse formed by a constant mass loss rate and expanding at a constant velocity . from the widths of the radio lines we are able to estimate the terminal gas expansion velocity , @xmath721.5kms@xmath41 .",
    "the turbulent velocity width affects the effectiveness of the radiative excitation .",
    "however , since this is only of minor importance , we will use a constant value of 0.5kms@xmath41 throughout the envelope . the inner radius we set to 4r@xmath42 ;",
    "the stellar radius being estimated to be 4.5@xmath310@xmath1 cm [ we note here that lopez et al . @xcite found the dust condensation radius to be about 6r@xmath42 , where the dust temperature is @xmath7@xmath43 .",
    "the inner parts of the cse are complicated regions of which we have a very limited understanding , see e.g. ryde et al .",
    "@xcite , and where many of the basic assumptions of our model are certainly not valid . the properties of this region could , in principle , be of importance for the excitation of the higher rotational levels .",
    "according to our tests , however , an initial velocity gradient for example , affects the intensities only marginally .",
    "we have also performed tests showing that a change of the inner radius by a factor of two affects the derived fir line intensities by at most a few percent .",
    "the photodissociation radius of the co envelope is defined as the location where the fractional abundance of co is half the photospheric value .",
    "this was estimated to be 3.2@xmath3@xmath44 cm for @xmath0co ( for the estimated mass loss rate ) using the calculations by mamon et al . @xcite .",
    "the two isotopic variants have different photodissociation and chemical fractionation behaviour , but according to mamon et al .",
    "@xcite these effects tend to cancel out , and the authors predict that the @xmath0co/@xmath1co - ratio is constant with radius , except that the @xmath1co envelope extends slightly further out . here",
    "we assume the same radius for both isotopic variants .",
    "the @xmath2=10 lines are affected the most when varying the outer radius , but according to our calculations only by @xmath720% in intensity , even if the outer radius is changed by a factor of two .",
    "we adopt an initial abundance of @xmath0co with respect to h@xmath17 , @xmath45 , of 10@xmath46 .",
    "the estimated mass loss rate scales roughly as @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath1co abundance is obtained from the best - fit model .",
    "when running our model we vary the free parameters , the mass loss rate , the @xmath48-ratio , and the dust parameter @xmath49 , until we get a good fit to the observed @xmath0co and @xmath1co radio line intensities , profiles , and radial brightness distributions ( nyman et al . 1993 ) .",
    "this gives the kinetic temperature structure of the cse , albeit constrained only by emission from the outer regions .",
    "finally , we compare the model fluxes for the higher rotational transitions with our lws observations . in figs  [ radio ] & [ iso ]",
    "we have plotted the line profiles ( convolved with the instrumental resolutions ) of the best - fit model to the @xmath0co lines ( there are narrow interstellar co lines present in the blue wing of the radio lines , and we exclude these lines when integrating the radio fluxes ) .",
    "we also plot the best model fit to the @xmath1co lines for the best estimate of the @xmath48-ratio .    from a simple error analysis",
    ", we arrive at a mass loss rate ( based on the radio observations ) of ( 1@xmath100.2)@xmath310@xmath4 ( excluding uncertainties in distance , @xmath50 abundance , and the assumed circumstellar model ) , in agreement with other estimates ( nyman et al .",
    "1993 ; le bertre 1997 ) .",
    "we obtain a @xmath48-ratio of 5.5@xmath101 .",

    "a high abundance of @xmath1co could affect the modelled line intensities significantly .",
    "for a @xmath48-ratio of only 5.5 implies that cooling by @xmath1co could be as high as 20% of that of @xmath0co .",
    "we have inluded @xmath1co cooling in the same self - consistent way as for @xmath0co and it turns out that its relative cooling is somewhat higher than 20% , fig .",

    "closer to the star h@xmath17 cooling dominates but very little emission from this part of the envelope contributes to the line emission observed . in the cool , tenuous , outer parts of the envelope , where most of the observed emission arises , cooling due to the adiabatic expansion dominates .",
    "we derive a dust parameter @xmath49@xmath72 ( with an estimated error of about 30% ) , i.e. twice as large as the one we used to fit the co radio lines of in our modelling of this object .",
    "this indicates that the dust properties or the relative amount of dust could be different in the two objects .",
    "our result is consistent with the finding by groenewegen et al .",
    "@xcite in their dust models that has a dust - to - gas ratio which is about twice the value for ( using the same values for other dust parameters ) . however , our derived dust parameter is sensitive to the adopted luminosity , and hence the result is uncertain .",
    "the model fluxes compare well with the observed fir fluxes within the estimated errors , see table  1 , although we note that the fluxes from lines at longer wavelengths are systematically higher compared to what the model predicts , possibly indicating a systematic error .",
    "we conclude that the fir data , probing the inner regions of the cse , are consistent with the model derived from radio observations .",
    "thus , we suggest that there have been no significant changes in the stellar wind characteristics over the past @xmath75000 years . due to",
    "the estimated large uncertainties in the lws data the mass loss rate in the inner parts may have changed by about a factor of three and still be consistent with the model . likewise , there appears to have been no significant change in the @xmath48-ratio over this period .",
    "we believe that the circumstellar @xmath48-ratio is very close to the @xmath5-ratio in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "a @xmath5-ratio of only 5.5 is just slightly larger than the equilibrium value of 33.5 found from hydrogen burning through the cno - cycle .",
    "such a low @xmath5-ratio puts close to the group of c - stars known as the j - type stars , which have @xmath5-ratios of 34 ( lambert et al .",
    "optically bright c - stars often have ratios above 30 @xcite , and this seems to apply also for high mass loss rate objects ( greaves & holland 1997 ) .",
    "the best example of the latter is for which kahane et al .",
    "@xcite derived a value of @xmath5=44@xmath103 . from its",
    "@xmath5-ratio resembles more closely the extreme oh / ir - stars which are massive agb stars in the very last phases of evolution ( delfosse et al .",
    "the low @xmath5-ratio of the oh / ir stars may be caused by hot bottom burning .",
    "this occurs when the temperature is larger than @xmath780@xmath61 and this is only achieved in massive ( 5 - 8 m@xmath35 ) agb stars @xcite .",
    "the luminosity derived for from the period - luminosity relation ( @xmath62 l@xmath35 ) is , however , lower than typical oh / ir luminosities ( @xmath73@xmath63 l@xmath35 ) .",
    "thus , may have been a j - star for which the @xmath5-ratio has remained low despite it probably being highly evolved .",
    "alternatively , it may be a fairly massive star , which has recently become a carbon star due to quenching of hot bottom burning ( frost et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we have shown that modelling radio and fir lines simultaneously is potentially an interesting diagnostic method for probing the stellar wind history of giant stars .",
    "of special interest are , e.g. , the group of oh / ir stars which are suggested to be undergoing an onset of a superwind phase with a drastically enhanced mass - loss rate during the recent 500 - 1000 years ( delfosse et al .",
