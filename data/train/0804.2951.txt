    "neutral hydrogen remaining in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) absorbs the radiation from distant sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this intergalactic absorption seems to be caused by numerous discrete systems , which are called absorbers in this paper , on the line of sight .",
    "the absorbers probably consist of various types of objects : the outer edge of galaxies , halo gas , diffuse medium in the intergalactic space , etc .",
    "they probably connect with each other and form the `` cosmic web '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because of such clumpy nature of the igm , the intergalactic absorption fluctuates among the lines of sight .",
    "thus , we can not predict the amount of the absorption for a certain line of sight .",
    "however , we can predict a mean amount of the absorption with its standard deviation for many lines of sight in a statistical sense ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that a monte carlo simulation is very powerful to discuss not only the mean absorption but also the dispersion correctly .",
    "here we present such a simulation . because many observational results of the igm absorbers have been published since 1999",
    ", we update the absorbers statistics to be input into the simulation .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a new mean curve of the intergalactic absorption based on the density distribution produced by a cosmological simulation .",
    "however , he discussed mean transmission only .",
    "@xcite have done a monte carlo simulation and discuss the distribution of the absorption amount .",
    "however , they concentrate on only lyman @xmath0 absorption . in this paper",
    ", we will examine the stochastic nature not only of the lyman series absorption but also of the lyman continuum one .",
    "this is motivated by the recent observational attempts for determining the escape fraction of the lyman continuum , especially the hydrogen ionising photons , from distant galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the process towards the escape fraction ,",
    "we need a correction of the intergalactic absorption for the lyman continuum of the distant galaxies . since the lyman continuum absorption by the igm has not been measured well observationally , a model predicting the absorption amount of the lyman continuum is required .",
    "the effective optical depth through a clumpy igm for the frequency @xmath2 in the rest - frame of a source at the redshift @xmath3 is ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of absorbers along the line of sight per unit redshift @xmath6 interval and per unit hi column density @xmath7 interval , and @xmath8 is the optical depth of an absorber with @xmath7 at @xmath6 , with being the hi cross section @xmath9 at the frequency @xmath10 in the absorber s rest - frame . if we assume the column density distribution of the absorbers as a power - law with an index @xmath11 independent of the redshift , which is well found in observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have @xmath12 since observations show @xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the maximum contribution to @xmath14 is made by absorbers with @xmath15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the absorption of the lyman continuum is mainly caused by the lyman limit systems ( llss ) with @xmath16 @xmath17 , not by the lyman @xmath0 forest ( laf ) with @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , we take a great care of the treatment of llss in order to properly compute the lyman continuum absorption by the igm .",
    "moreover , the lyman continuum absorption should be very stochastic because llss are relatively rare .",
    "therefore , we also need to model the dispersion of the absorption correctly .",
    "previous works about the intergalactic absorption assumed different number evolutions along the redshift for the laf and llss .",
    "@xcite assumed @xmath20 for the laf @xcite and @xmath21 for llss @xcite .",
    "@xcite assumed a different set of the laf number evolution and the same lls evolution as @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite assumed the number evolution extracted from a cosmological simulation for the laf and @xmath22 for llss @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed in their appendix that recent llss observations reported by @xcite can be reproduced by a common number evolution function for both types of absorbers .",
    "we take this common function scenario in this paper because of its simplicity .",
    "the rest of this paper consists of 5 sections ; in section 2 , we present an empirical distribution function of the intergalactic absorbers and show that the function reproduces all the observational data simultaneously . in section 3",
    ", we describe the procedure of our monte carlo simulation . in section 4 , we describe the method for calculating the igm transmission , compare our transmission model with others , show that our model reproduces the observed lyman series transmissions very well , predict the lyman continuum transmission , discuss the distribution functions of the intergalactic opacities of the lyman continuum as well as lyman @xmath0 line , and present a method for estimating the lyman continuum opacity from the lyman @xmath0 one . in section 5 , we discuss the detectability of the lyman continuum from distant galaxies with our monte carlo results .",
    "the final section is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we present an empirical distribution function of the intergalactic absorbers which is input into the monte carlo simulation in the later sections . we consider a functional form with several parameters which are determined so as to reproduce the observed redshift , column density , and doppler parameter distributions of the intergalactic absorbers .",
    "especially , we assume a common number evolution function along the redshift for all types of absorbers .",
    "an absorber have three physical quantities characterising itself : redshift @xmath6 , hi column density @xmath7 , and doppler parameter @xmath23 . here",
    ", we assume that these three quantities are independent of each other .",
    "this is just for simplicity although a slight correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath23 has found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "then , we express the number of absorbers per unit volume of the three parameters space as @xmath24 note that we have assumed a common functional form of the number evolution along the redshift for all types of absorbers as @xmath25 . in the following , we determine the functional forms of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 so as to reproduce the observed distribution functions .",

    "the break column density @xmath46 is assumed to be @xmath47 @xmath17 which is the usual criterion for llss , i.e. the absorber with a column density larger than this value is optically thick for the lyman limit photon .",
    "a physical explanation for this break , which gives more number of higher column density absorbers , is a self - shielding effect ; the neutral fraction inside an optically thick absorber ( i.e. llss ) could be kept higher .",

    "@xcite have explained that this break is due to a steep decline of the ionising background intensity from @xmath50 to 0 .",
    "thus , we assume a break at @xmath50 in the functional form of @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite suggest a steepening of the lyman @xmath0 opacity evolution at @xmath51 , which means more absorbers than expected at high redshift .",
    "as done in @xcite , thus , we assume another break at @xmath1 in @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath52 we adopt @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 which are determined by eye to fit the observed number evolutions along the redshift of the laf in figure  2 .",
    "we also adopt the second break in @xmath25 at @xmath56 with @xmath57 to reproduce a rapid increase of the lyman @xmath0 opacity found by @xcite . with these parameters ,",
    "the observed number evolutions of all types of absorbers are reproduced simultaneously .",
    "note that we have assumed @xmath26 to be a double power - law as equation ( 4 ) .",

    ", we show the results generated by our monte carlo simulation , whose procedures are described in the next section .",
    "we have confirmed that our monte carlo simulation reproduces the input distribution functions excellently .",
    "figure  1 shows that our column density distribution @xmath26 is very consistent with the observations .",
    "note that the vertical axis in the panel is not exactly same as @xmath26 but the column density distribution averaged over a redshift range ( and divided by the `` absorption distance '' ) .",
    "figure  2 shows that our redshift evolution @xmath25 nicely reproduces the observed redshift evolution for all types of absorbers simultaneously .",
    "note that the vertical axis in the panel is not exactly same as @xmath25 but the number density of absorbers with column densities larger than a certain value .",
    "although the disagreement of dlas at @xmath50 ( but less than a factor of two ) might suggest a redshift dependence of @xmath26 , we avoid this complexity .",

    "seven cases of the limiting magnitude of the lyman continuum observation are shown : @xmath71 , 2.0 , 2.5 , 3.0 , 3.5 , 4.0 , and 4.5 , where @xmath72 is the observed magnitude in the non - ionising ultraviolet ( @xmath731500   in the rest - frame ) of the galaxy .",
    "we expect a larger probability for a deeper observation ( i.e. larger @xmath74 ) or a more luminous object ( i.e. smaller @xmath72 ) .",
    "note that the detectable probability depends on the observing wavelength range ( see text ) .",
    "table  3 is a summary of the expected detectable probability ( % ) with the assumption of @xmath69 which is estimated from the two detections of @xcite .",
    "when observing the lyman continuum of 880910   in the source rest - frame , we find that 7080% galaxies with a large escape fraction of @xmath69 are detectable for @xmath75 and 2045% galaxies are detectable even for @xmath76 if the objects are 24.5 ab in uv and the limiting magnitude of the lyman continuum is 27.027.5 ab . in the observations of @xcite , the limiting magnitude of the lyman continuum and the average observed uv magnitude are 27.56 ab and 23.92 ab , respectively , and the average redshift is 3.06 ; the detectable probability of a galaxy with @xmath69 in their sample is about 90% . since @xcite detected 2 out of 14 galaxies , therefore , we expect that the fraction of the galaxies with @xmath69 is about 16% in their sample .",
    "this suggests that there is a large variance of the escape fraction at @xmath77 , which is very interesting and whose origin should be understood in the context of the galaxy evolution in future .",
    "we note that the detectable probability in table  3 may be the most optimistic case because the probability depends on the observing wavelength range .",
    "if we observe a wider wavelength range , the probability of having a lls in the corresponding redshift range increases , then , the transmission and the detectable probability decreases . in addition , if we observe a wavelength range far from the lyman limit ( e.g. , @xmath78  ) , the probability affected by a lls also increases , then , the detectable probability decreases ( see also figs .  4 - 6 and 10 ) .",
    "therefore , we should take into account the observing wavelength range properly when estimating the detectable probability for future observations .",
    "motivated by recent attempts for determining the escape fraction of the lyman continuum from distant galaxies , we have made a monte carlo simulation of the intergalactic absorption in order to model the lyman continuum absorption properly . for this simulation , we have derived an empirical distribution function of the intergalactic absorbers , lyman @xmath0 forest ( laf ) , lyman limit systems ( llss ) , and damped lyman @xmath0 systems ( dlas ) , from the observed statistics of the absorbers . in the distribution function of the absorbers ,",
    "we have assumed a single functional form of the redshift distribution for all types of the absorbers , while the previous models of the intergalactic absorption assumed two different functional forms for the laf and llss ( and dla ) .",
    "the transmission functions obtained from our simulation are very consistent with the previous models except for @xcite which predicts smaller transmissions than others .",
    "the lyman series transmissions by our simulation excellently agree with the observational data , which ensures validity of our model . we have predicted the lyman continuum transmissions as a function of the source redshift . although observational estimates of the lyman continuum transmission are quite rare in the literature , one observational estimate based on @xcite is consistent with our prediction .",
    "the distribution function of the lyman @xmath0 opacity for a source redshift seems log - normal with a tail towards large opacities .",
    "this tail is produced by dlas . since the number density of dlas increases along the redshift , the significance of the tail in the distribution function increases . as found by @xcite",
    ", we also find that the effect of llss on the lyman @xmath0 opacity is small . along the source redshift ,",
    "the mean of the log - normal part increases but the variance decreases .",
    "these features are found in recent observations .",
    "the distribution function of the lyman continuum opacity shows a very broad tail towards a large opacity which is produced by llss . unlike the lyman @xmath0 opacity ,",
    "the effect of dlas on the lyman continuum opacity is small .",
    "rarity of llss controlling the lyman continuum opacity provides us with a chance to have a clean line of sight for @xmath1 ; the probability of a clean ( i.e. optical depth less than unity ) line of sight at 900   in the source rest - frame is about 70% for the source redshift @xmath77 and about 20% for @xmath1 .",
    "a good correlation between the lyman @xmath0 opacity and the lyman continuum one is found although @xcite noted no correlation in their simulation .",
    "this may be because a small dynamic range of the lyman @xmath0 opacity in their simulation .",
    "based on the correlation we find , we may predict a statistically probable range of the lyman continuum opacity as a function of the lyman @xmath0 opacity .",
    "this may be useful to estimate the lyman continuum opacity from the lyman @xmath0 one for individual galaxy .",
    "finally , we have predicted the detectable probability of a galaxy with a large escape fraction of the lyman continuum based on our simulation .",
    "for example , the detectable probability is 86% when the limiting magnitude of the lyman continuum observations is 3.5 ab deeper than the non - ionising ultraviolet magnitude of the sample galaxy with an escape ratio @xmath69 at @xmath79 .",
    "the small number fraction of the galaxies detected in the lyman continuum by @xcite ( 2 out of 14 sample galaxies ) suggests a large variance of the escape fraction at @xmath79 .",
    "this should be understood in the context of the galaxy evolution in future .",

    "the intrinsic flux density can be estimated from the observed flux density at a wavelength free from the igm absorption , that is , @xmath84  , if we assume an intrinsic spectrum .",
    "when we assume the reference wavelength of 1500  , the lyman @xmath0 and the lyman continuum transmissions are @xmath85 and @xmath86    we take the observed flux densities from the composite spectrum of qsos by @xcite .",
    "the sample consists of 15 qsos at @xmath87 .",
    "the qso composite spectrum is constructed in order to compare the composite spectrum of lbgs from which @xcite detected the lyman continuum of the sample lbgs . from table  2 in @xcite , we have @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the arbitrary unit of the flux density ( per hz ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath90 from their value of @xmath91 .",
    "the intrinsic spectrum of qsos is the largest source of the error in this estimation .",
    "the spectra of qsos can be fit by a composite of power - laws .",
    "we here discuss the indices under the power - law assumption : @xmath92 .",
    "the index in the extreme - ultraviolet ( including the lyman continuum ) is still controversial . @xcite",
    "obtained @xmath93 from 184 qsos at @xmath50 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , @xcite obtained @xmath94 from 85 agns at @xmath95 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this contrast may be due to an evolution of the spectrum along the redshift and the luminosity @xcite , and also there may be the difficulty of the correction for the igm absorption .",
    "we here assume two possible indices of @xmath96 and @xmath97 . for longer wavelength ,",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath98 .",
    "we here adopt @xmath99 , taking into account a large variance of the indices among qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the intrinsic ratios of the flux densities adopted here are @xmath100 , and @xmath101 or @xmath102 .    the observed ratios of the flux densities measured in the composite spectrum of qsos at @xmath103 by @xcite and the intrinsic ratios described above result in @xmath104 , and @xmath105 or @xmath106 . finally , we summarise the lyman continuum transmission as @xmath107 , where we put the sum of the internal and external errors as an error estimate .",
    "we should note one point here . in the procedure for obtaining the intrinsic spectrum of qsos",
    ", we need the igm absorption correction .",
    "then , we used the intrinsic spectrum to obtain @xmath108 .",
    "thus , it is like a tautology although the intrinsic spectrum and @xmath108 are obtained from the different data and the different authors .",
    "however , we may consider that the obtained @xmath108 still have a meaning since we have assumed a wide range of the spectral indices for the intrinsic spectrum . for future measurements of @xmath108",
    ", we may use an independent intrinsic spectrum of qsos , for example , based on an accretion disk model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?"
