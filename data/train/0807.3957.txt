    "we can think of a family of substances , where each member of the family is specified by the set of parameters , say , ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the simplest example is the family of the van der waals gases where each member of the family is characterized by the parameters @xmath17 ( measure of the long range attraction between the gas particles ) and @xmath18 ( measure of the short range repulsion between the gas particles ) .    for the case of a family of substances",

    "this is the same function @xmath0 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) , in the context of infinitesimal legendre transformations .",
    "once we eliminate the parameters ( @xmath16 ) from @xmath13 equations of state , we have a single relation f(q^0 , q^1 , , q^n , p_1 , , p_n ) = 0 .",
    "the function @xmath21 defines a dynamics on the hypersurface of thermodynamic phase space .",
    "we encounter a similar function in classical mechanics and there we call it the hamiltonian or generating function of the mechanical system . here",
    "also we call this function the hamiltonian of a family of substances .",
    "thus the thermodynamics of a family of substances with @xmath1 degrees of freedom is described by a contact manifold of @xmath2 dimensions with a contact structure @xmath9 and a family of hypersurfaces @xmath22 of co - dimension one on the manifold .",
    "once the hamiltonian @xmath0 of a family of substances is given , the equations of state of each member of the family can be obtained by solving the hamilton - jacobi equation f(q^0 , q^1 , , q^n , , , ) = 0 .",

    "these equations are the analogues of hamilton s equations in classical mechanics .",
    "the parameters ( @xmath23 ) characterizing a particular member of the family are given by the initial conditions of this dynamics .",
    "the complete integral of the hamilton - jacobi equation can be obtained once we eliminate the ` time ' variable @xmath24 from the above equations .",
    "this in turn gives the equations of state that are characterized by the choice of parameters ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the ` time ' variable of this dynamics is related to entropy @xcite .",
    "we closely follow the approach of deo , jain and tan @xcite for the termodynamics of string gas . the string gas treated under the ideal gas approximation .",
    "that is , the interaction between strings is so weak that the spectrum of the theory is the same as that of the free string .",
    "the following discussion can be applied to the case of closed bosonic , heterotic and type - ii superstrings .",
    "( for closed bosonic strings we have to worry about the presence of a tachyon and the infinite cosmological constant . the results are valid for the bosonic case also if the divergences originating from these are ignored . )    at temperatures close to the hagedorn temperature the canonical partition function is ill defined and thus it is not useful to deduce the thermodynamic properties of the string gas . thus one should start from the more fundamental microcanonical ensemble description of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the system is in equilibrium and it has a fixed total energy @xmath15 . since there are no conserved quantities other than the energy , _ an isolated system in equilibrium , with total energy @xmath15 samples all its eigenstates at that energy with equal probability . _ assuming that this fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics is valid , the microcanonical distribution function or the total density of states @xmath25 gives the consistent definition of the entropy of the system s(e , v )  ( e , v ) .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics says that infinitesimal changes in the thermodynamical quantities , volume @xmath12 , pressure @xmath26 , temperature @xmath27 , entropy @xmath14 and total energy @xmath15 , must satisfy the contact form de - tds+pdv = 0 .",
    "it also implies that only two out of the five variables are independent .",
    "the remaining variables are given by the equations of state .",
    "when the fundamental relation is known , that is the thermodynamical potential @xmath14 is given as a function of the coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath12 , the remaining two equations of state are ( ) _ v ,   ( ) _ e .",
