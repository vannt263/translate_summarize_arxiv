    "non - relativistic and semi - relativistic hamiltonians with infinitely rising potentials are often used to model quark - quark interactions or other quantum particles in a trap .",
    "there are many methods for solving the schrdinger equation with these kinds of potentials .",
    "they mostly rely on variational principles and can provide satisfactory results for the few lowest - lying states . however , they are unable to account for the most important property of the system ; they can not grasp the infinitely many bound states , which can be important if we want to consider three or more particles .    in this paper",
    "we offer a method that can provide an exact treatment of the infinitely rising confinement potentials .",
    "we consider both non - relativistic and semi - relativistic kinetic energy with linear and quadratic confinement .",
    "we write the bound - state problem in integral equation form and incorporate the kinetic energy and the confining terms into the green s operator .",
    "then we perform a separable expansion of the short - range terms in the coulomb - sturmian basis .",
    "this basis allows an exact evaluation of the green s operator in terms of continued fractions and provides an asymptotically exact treatment of problems with linear and quadratic confinement .",

    "we consider first a hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the non - relativistic kinetic energy operator , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are confining and short - range potentials , respectively .",
    "the non - relativistic kinetic energy is given by @xmath4 for @xmath2 we assume a polynomial potential with linear and a quadratic confinement @xmath5 we will see that the @xmath6 and a constant term in @xmath2 does not make the evaluation of the green s operator any harder .",
    "to set up an integral equation , we need the asymptotic hamiltonian . in this case",
    "the asymptotic hamiltonian can be identified as @xmath7 then the original hamiltonian becomes @xmath8 the bound states are the solutions of the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath9 where @xmath10      we solve the integral equations by using the coulomb - sturmian ( cs ) separable expansion approach . in configuration space , the cs functions are defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the angular momentum , @xmath14 is a parameter and @xmath15 is the laguerre polynomial .",
    "the biorthonormal partner to @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 the orthogonality and completeness of the basis states , in angular momentum subspace , is given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the cs functions also have a nice analytic form in momentum space @xmath20 and @xmath21    we can approximate the short - range potential @xmath3 in a separable way . here",
    "we adopt the double - basis expansion technique proposed originally in ref .",
    "@xcite and extended later to coulomb - like potentials in ref .",
    "it amounts to expanding @xmath3 as @xmath22 this is an exact representation if @xmath23 goes to infinity and becomes an approximation if @xmath23 is kept finite .",
    "the cs matrix elements of the potential have to be evaluated numerically .",
    "this can easily be done in configuration or momentum space , depending how the potential is defined .",
    "if we plug the approximated potential operator into the lippmann - schwinger equation we get @xmath24 acting with the bra @xmath25 from the left , we arrive at a matrix equation for the vector @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , this equation is a homogeneous linear equation @xmath29 whose solution can be found as zeros of the determinant @xmath30      the green s operator ( [ gc ] ) is defined by the relation @xmath31 where @xmath32 this equation in the cs basis looks like @xmath33 and we need the @xmath34 upper left part of the @xmath35 green s matrix .",
    "the operator @xmath36 has an infinite matrix representation .",
    "it can be constructed from the following matrix elements @xcite : @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41    & \\text{for   } n'=n\\\\   -\\frac{3}{8b^3}[(4n'+2l)(n'+2l+2)+(n'-1)(n-2 ) ] \\sqrt{n'(n'+2l+1 ) }   & \\text{for   } n ' = n+1\\\\ \\frac{3}{8b^2 } \\sqrt{n'(n'-1)(n'+2l)(n'+2l+1 ) }   & \\text{for    } n'= n+2\\\\ - \\frac{1}{8b^3}(2n'+2l)\\sqrt{n'(n'-1)(n'-2)(n'+2l+1)(n'+2l ) }   & \\text{for    } n'= n+3\\\\ 0 & \\text{for    } n ' > n+3 \\end{cases } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    in our previous study we found that the inverse of an infinite symmetric tridiagonal matrix can be determined by a continued fraction @xcite . in this case , if the @xmath42 term is present in @xmath36 , its matrix representation is a septadiagonal infinite symmetric band matrix .",
    "such a matrix can be considered as a tridiagonal matrix of @xmath43 block matrices . if @xmath44 is the highest power in @xmath36 , the matrix is pentadiagonal , which can be considered as tridiagonal matrix of @xmath45 blocks .",
    "an infinite symmetric band matrix can be considered as a tridiagonal matrix of block matrices .",
    "the corresponding green s matrix can be constructed by matrix continued fractions @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a matrix continued fraction defined recursively by @xmath48 and @xmath49 refers to @xmath43 or @xmath45 blocks .",
    "the index @xmath50 or @xmath51 depending on whether we cover @xmath52 by @xmath43 or @xmath45 blocks .",
    "we found , that @xmath53 is an inverse of the modified @xmath52 matrix .",
    "the modification is a matrix continued fraction @xmath47 , which only effects the bottom right @xmath54 or @xmath45 block of @xmath52 .",
    "now we consider the problem of the previous section with semi - relativistic kinetic energy @xmath55 where @xmath56 the semi - relativistic kinetic energy operator in the cs basis does not have a tridiagonal or band - matrix structure .",
    "numerical studies show that its matrix representation for large @xmath57 and @xmath58 indices is pentadiagonal dominant ( see table [ tab0 ] ) .",
