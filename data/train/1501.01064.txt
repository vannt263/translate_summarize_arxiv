    "lattice gas with long - range coulomb interaction has attracted considerable interest over the past 10 years .",
    "two types of long - range models have been studied .",
    "one where the interaction between the charges @xmath6 ( coulomb lattice gas , or clg ) , and the other where the interaction @xmath7 ( lattice coulomb gas , or lcg ) .",
    "studies of various models of one@xcite- and two@xcite - dimensional clg and lcg using different methods have shown the existence of multiple phase transitions , complexity in phase diagrams and their practical applications to real materials , e.g. , kcu@xmath8s@xmath9@xcite ni@xmath10al@xmath1(oh)@xmath0(co@xmath11)@xmath12.@xmath13h@xmath0o , ... .@xcite in three - dimensional clg on a simple cubic ( sc ) lattice , several works have been done using either theoretical calculations ( mean - field approximation@xcite and pad expansion@xcite ) or monte carlo ( mc ) simulations.@xcite however , to the best of our knowledge , there are no extensive studies of clg on a fcc lattice excepting when all the lattice sites are occupied by either a positive or a negative charge.@xcite it is well known that fcc lattice involves frustration.@xcite since the role played by frustration in the nature of phase transition in ising - type systems ( on triangular or fcc lattice ) has been of great interest in statistical physics,@xcite it is of equal interest to see what role frustration effects play in long - range coulomb systems .    from materials perspective , a quaternary compound ag@xmath14pb@xmath15sb@xmath14te@xmath16 has recently emerged as a material for potential use in efficient thermoelectric power generation .",
    "it has been found that for low concentrations of ag , sb and when doped appropriately , this system exhibits a high thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath17 of @xmath182.2 at 800 k.@xcite it is one of the best known bulk thermoelectrics at high temperatures .",
    "quantitative understanding of its properties requires understanding of atomic structure .",
    "experimental data@xcite suggest that this system belongs to an entire family of compounds , which are compositionally complex yet they possess the simple cubic nacl structure on average , but the detailed ordering of ag , pb and sb ions is not clear .",
    "however , as pointed out by bilc _",
    "et al._,@xcite the electronic structure of these compounds depends sensitively on the nature of structural arrangements of ag and sb ions .",
    "hence a simple but accurate theoretical model is necessary to understand and predict the ordering of the ions in these systems . in this paper",
    "we present a simple ionic model of ag@xmath14pb@xmath15sb@xmath14te@xmath16 that explicitly includes the long - range coulomb interaction and in which the ions are located at the sites of a fcc lattice .",
    "as will be shown in the next section , this problem maps onto a spin-@xmath19 ising model on a fcc lattice with long - range antiferromagnetic interaction .",
    "we present details of the model in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we discuss our monte carlo simulation results including a full phase diagram in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "the summary is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "we use a model where the minimization of electrostatic interaction between different ions in the compounds can lead to the compositional ordering that exists in the system.@xcite the total electrostatic energy is then expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the static dielectric constant , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are , respectively , the position and charge of an atom at site @xmath25 of cell @xmath26 .",
    "this model has been successfully applied to cubic perovskite alloys .",
    "@xcite here we consider supercells of the nacl - type structure made of two interpenetrating fcc lattices with possible mixtures of different atomic species on na sites , i.e. , @xmath27na(ag , sb , pb ) , cl(te)@xmath28 , with periodic boundary condition .",
    "alloying occurs on the na sublattice . in a simple ionic model of ag@xmath14pb@xmath15sb@xmath14te@xmath16",
    ", we can assume the pb ion to be @xmath29 , te ion to be @xmath30 , ag ion to be @xmath31 , and sb ion to be @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is independent of @xmath26 . focusing on the na sublattice sites where ordering occurs , we write @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 . substituting the expression for @xmath38 into eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we can write @xmath39 , where the subscripts refer to the number of powers of @xmath40 appearing in that term",
    ". then @xmath41 is just a constant , it is the energy of an ideal pbte lattice ; @xmath42 vanishes due to charge neutrality . the only term which depends on the charge configuration is @xmath43 ; it is given by @xmath44 where ion positions are measured in unit of the fcc lattice constant @xmath45 ; @xmath26 and @xmath46 run over the @xmath47 sites of the na - sublattice of nacl structure .",
    "thus if we start from a pbte lattice as a reference system and replace two pb ions by one ag ion and one sb ion , we map the system unto an effective clg with effective charges -1 , + 1 ( of equal amount ) and 0 ; this implies a constraint , @xmath48 .",
    "the model therefore maps onto a spin-@xmath19 ising model ( @xmath49 ) with long - range antiferromagnetic interaction .",
    "the short - range version of this model [ nearest- ( n.n . ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( n.n.n . ) interaction],@xcite a generalization of this model by adding a n.n ferromagnetic interaction@xcite and a continuum version of this model that takes into account the finite size of the charged particles ( rpm or charged hard sphere model)@xcite have been investigated .",
    "comparison with these works will be made in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .",
    "because of the attraction between + 1 and -1 charges , the ag and sb ions tend to come together and form clusters or some sort of ordered structures depending on the temperature at which these compounds are synthesized and the annealing scheme",
    ". the ordering may be quite complex compared to the one on a simple cubic lattice because of the frustration associated with spins on a fcc lattice and antiferromagnetic interaction ( in the ising model ) . in our calculations of ag@xmath14pb@xmath15sb@xmath14te@xmath16 , an equivalent formula , ( agsbte@xmath0)@xmath1(pbte)@xmath2 , is used ; where @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , is the concentration of ag and sb in the pb sublattice .",
    "to study the thermodynamic properties and microstructural ordering of the system , we have done canonical ensemble monte carlo simulations following the usual metropolis criterion @xcite using the energy given by eq .",
    "( [ en2 ] ) , i.e. , particles interact via site - exclusive ( multiple occupancy forbidden ) coulomb interaction . in the ising model problem",
    ", this corresponds to a fixed magnetization simulation .",
    "we used ewald summation @xcite to handle this long - range interaction employing a very fast lookup table scheme using hoshen - kopelman algorithm.@xcite this model is parameter - free in the sense that @xmath52 defines a characteristic energy .",
    "a simulation for a fixed concentration @xmath3 starts at a high temperature with an initial random configuration followed by gradual cooling .",
    "for each temperature @xmath53 , we use @xmath54 sweeps ( mc steps per lattice site ) to get thermal equilibration followed by @xmath55 sweeps for averaging .",
    "particles move either via hopping to empty sites or via exchange mechanism .",
    "the equilibrium configuration at a given temperature @xmath53 is used as the initial configuration for a study at a nearby temperature .",
    "we monitored different thermodynamic quantities and look at the microstructures .",
    "the data presented below were obtained with system size @xmath56 ( i.e. , @xmath57 fcc cells in one direction , 2048 lattice sites in total ) with periodic boundaries .",
    "energy and heat capacity per particle versus temperature for @xmath58 .",
    "phase transitions occur at @xmath59 and @xmath60 which are first - order and second - order transitions , respectively .",
    "there is hysteresis associated with the low @xmath53 transition.,width=336,height=240 ]    figure [ enerx75 ] shows the energy and heat capacity ( obtained using energy fluctuation ) for @xmath58 where the two energy curves correspond to slow cooling and slow heating .",
    "we see evidence of two phase transitions , one at @xmath59 and the other at @xmath61 .",
    "the heat capacity curve shows peaks at the above two @xmath53 values .",
    "the transition at higher @xmath53 is continuous and indicates a lattice gas - liquidlike phase transition .",
    "there is no apparent hysteresis associated with this transition .",
    "the low @xmath53 transition , on the other hand , appears to be first - order .",
    "there is an energy discontinuity and there is hysteresis , albeit small , associated with this transition .",
    "for @xmath62 we see only one transition which is first - order ( fig . [ enerx25 ] ) .",

    "phase transition occurs at @xmath64 which is first - order .",
    "there is hysteresis associated with this transition.,width=336,height=240 ]    this suggests that with decreasing @xmath3 the system changes from undergoing 2 to 1 phase transition .",
    "as @xmath3 decreases from @xmath65 , the high @xmath53 continuous and low @xmath53 first - order phase transitions approach each other and the two transitions merge at @xmath66 . as @xmath3 increases from @xmath65 , the high @xmath53 continuous transition changes to first - order . at @xmath5 ,",
    "the transition is first - order in agreement with previous simulation results.@xcite we also monitored the structure factor @xmath67 for different @xmath68 values . for several @xmath68 values",
    ", we find that @xmath67 changes discontinuously at the first - order transition and smoothly at a continuous transition .",
    "concentration ( @xmath3 ) versus temperature ( @xmath53 ) phase diagram constructed from the loci of the heat capacity maxima .",
    "there are first ( solid lines ) and second ( dotted line ) order transitions with two possible tricritical points ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) : a at @xmath71 and b at @xmath72.,width=336,height=249 ]    to construct the total phase diagram , we have studied energy , heat capacity and structure factor as functions of temperature for a series 15 values of the concentration @xmath3 . figure [ phases ] shows the phase diagram constructed from the loci of specific heat maxima . the lattice gas - lattice solid and lattice liquid - lattice solid transitions are first - order . in the limit @xmath73 , the compound is simply pbte , the transition occurs at @xmath74 since there are no charged particles ( effective charges of pb and te are 0 ) . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the compound is agsbte@xmath0 .",
    "our simulations show a strongly first - order transition at @xmath75 and no other transition with decreasing @xmath53 .",
    "this strong first - order transition is softened by introducing defects into the system ( by decreasing @xmath3 from 1 ) .",
    "the hysteresis associated with this transition becomes smaller with decreasing @xmath3 from 1 and disappears at @xmath76 showing a changeover from a first- to a second - order transition .",
    "therefore , we have two possible tricritical points ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) : a at @xmath71 and b at @xmath72 .",
    "more accurate results on the tricritical points would require further careful large - scale simulations for more number of @xmath3 values , and perhaps much larger systems .",
    "we would now like to compare our results with those of previous simulations carried out for lattice rpm . in this model",

    "as regards the second tricritical point ( b ) , it is unique to the fcc lattice .",
    "dickman and stell@xcite found a high @xmath53 continuous phase transition ( @xmath85-transition ) in a simple cubic lattice as @xmath3 increased from @xmath81 to @xmath86 .",

    "the final configuration at a given @xmath53 is used as the initial configuration for the next @xmath53 .",
    "the fluctuation is large at high @xmath53 and getting smaller with lowering @xmath53 . from one @xmath53 to another",
