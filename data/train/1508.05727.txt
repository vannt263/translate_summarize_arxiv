    "in recent years , there has been significant interest in research on thermoelectric phenomena due to the increase in the demand for alternative energy sources .",
    "especially , since thermoelectric phenomena could transform heat currents into electric power , thermoelectric power generators can perhaps be used to convert waste heat into electric energy for use in environmentally friendly applications  @xcite .",
    "it is thus necessary to find a good thermoelectric material with a high thermoelectic energy conversion efficiency , characterized by the so - called thermoelectric figure of merit , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the seebeck coefficient , also known as the thermoelectric power ( thermopower ) , @xmath8 is the electrical conductivity , @xmath9 is the thermal conductivity , and @xmath10 is the absolute temperature of the material . over the past six decades",
    "it has been challenging to obtain @xmath11 values exceeding 2 , because the parameters of @xmath11 are generally interdependent  @xcite .",
    "a theoretical study in 1993 predicted that the @xmath11 value of low - dimensional structures could be significantly enhanced , thanks to the quantum confinement effect to create sharp features in the density - of - states ( dos )  @xcite .",
    "this prediction was confirmed experimentally in 1996 using pbte / pb@xmath12eu@xmath13te , which exhibited a @xmath11 value up to about five times greater than that of the corresponding bulk value  @xcite .",
    "it is thus intriguing to evaluate other low - dimensional structures that might have excellent thermoelectric performance , either theoretically or experimentally .    as a one - dimensional material , single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts )",
    "were considered promising for thermoelectric materials due to their novel electronic properties which depend on their geometrical structure  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been difficult to obtain an ensemble of individual swnts with a specific @xmath14 structure to reveal the precise knowledge of the dependence of the thermoelectric power of individual swnts on band gap and diameter .",
    "most thermoelectric measurements were performed on bundled swnt samples whose geometrical and electronic structures are complex  @xcite , and thus the potential thermoelectric properties might have been lost because of interactions between different tubes  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 values reported for bundled swnts have remained in the range of @xmath15 to @xmath16  @xcite , in contrast to the commercial thermoelectric materials with @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "such bundled swnt samples consist of a collection of swnts with different diameters , metallicities , and chiralities , parameters to which the electronic structure is very sensitive  @xcite .",
    "the small @xmath11 value of the bundled swnts were mainly attributed to their low thermopower and high thermal conductivity , which might be a result of the mixture of different swnts and impurity in low concentration in the samples .    in this work",
    ", we will focus on evaluating the thermopower theoretically for many swnts , especially in the case of semiconducting swnts ( s - swnts ) , and thus to maximize the swnt thermopower and to suggest a new route for obtaining a larger @xmath11 for swnts . by calculating the thermopower of all individual s - swnts within a diameter range",
    "@xmath18 , we will show that , for tube diameters less than @xmath2 under low doping , the thermopower of s - swnts can be as large as @xmath3 at room temperature , which is large enough compared to the thermopower of bundled swnts , which is about @xmath19  @xcite . from this result",
    ", we believe that there is still much room available to improve the @xmath11 of swnt samples . for a more practical purpose",
    ", we also give an analytical formula to reproduce our numerical calculation of the s - swnt thermopower , which forms a map of the s - swnt thermopower .",
    "the calculated thermopower map could be useful for obtaining information on the s - swnt chirality with a desired thermopower value and thus it offers promise for using specially prepared s - swnt samples to guide the direction of future research on the thermoelectricity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we give the theoretical methods employed in this study to calculate the thermopower . in sec .  [ sec : results ] , we discuss the thermopower obtained from the numerical calculation and compare it with the analytical formula .",
    "we then summarize the results and give the future perspective in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we also provide some appendices for a detailed derivation of the thermopower analytical formula .",

    "to utilize the s - swnts as a main material in future thermoelectric devices , we consider a model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , in which two identical s - swnts , one with p - type and the other with n - type doping , are connected in parallel .",
    "each s - swnt should maintain its electronic charge distribution in the nonequilibrium state , for example , by a temperature gradient along the tube axis . by having their temperature gradient @xmath20 from an edge of each s - swnt to its other edge",
    ", charge carriers ( electrons or holes ) will flow with velocity @xmath21 from the hot edge with temperature @xmath22 to the cold edge with temperature @xmath23 .",
    "the carrier distribution @xmath24 , which depends on the electronic energy @xmath25 and chemical potential @xmath26 , is modified as a function of @xmath25 , following the boltzmann transport formalism .",
    "within such a process , an electric voltage @xmath27 can be generated .",
    "it is also known from earlier studies that the electron - phonon interaction is the main factor determining the electrical conductivity of swnts  @xcite , in which the so - called twisting ( tw ) phonon mode with a long wavelength gives the dominant contribution to the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "in particular , jiang _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the relaxation time from the electron scattering with the tw phonon mode is independent of the electron energy  @xcite .",
    "therefore , here we make the assumption that the thermopower from the boltzmann transport equation can be obtained by applying the relaxation time approximation ( rta ) and we may even treat the relaxation time as a constant . under the rta ,",
    "the thermopower or seebeck coefficient @xmath7 is expressed by @xmath28      g(\\varepsilon ) d\\varepsilon}{\\displaystyle \\int v(\\varepsilon )      \\tau(\\varepsilon ) v(\\varepsilon ) \\frac{\\partial        f_0(\\varepsilon)}{\\partial \\varepsilon } g(\\varepsilon )      d\\varepsilon } , \\label{eq : seebeck}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the unit carrier charge , @xmath30 is the average absolute temperature , @xmath31 is the carrier velocity , @xmath32 is the electronic ( dos ) , and @xmath33 is the carrier relaxation time .",
    "we employ both numerical and analytical methods to obtain @xmath7 from eq .  .",
    "in the full numerical approach , we can use the boltztrap code  @xcite , which is a widely - used package to calculate some thermoelectric properties , such as the thermopower and electrical conductivity .",
    "a necessary input for the boltztrap code is the electronic energy dispersion @xmath34 for all bands ( multiband structure ) .",
    "the boltztrap code also adopts a constant @xmath35 , whose plausibility in the case of s - swnts has been justified above . while the boltztrap code is actually sufficient for obtaining the thermopower from eq .",
    ", we can not discuss the physics of the thermopower of s - swnts without having an explicit formula for the thermopower that depends on some physical parameters , such as the swnt band gap and geometrical structure .",
    "therefore , we also solve eq .",
    "analytically by considering the valence band and the conduction band closest to the fermi energy , known as the two - band model  @xcite . the derivation of the analytical formula is explained in detail in appendices a - d .    as the input for the boltztrap code , we calculate the energy dispersion @xmath36 within the extended - tight binding ( etb ) model developed in our group  @xcite .",
    "the etb model takes into account long - range interactions , swnt curvature corrections , and geometrical structure optimizations , which are sufficient to reproduce the experimentally observed energy band gaps of the swnts  @xcite .",
    "the swnt structure in our notation is denoted by a set of integers @xmath14 which is a shorthand for the chiral vector @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the unit vectors of an unrolled graphene sheet  @xcite .",
    "the chiral vector @xmath40 defines the circumferential direction of the tube , giving the diameter @xmath41 .",
    "another vector perpendicular to @xmath40 defines the tube axis , which is called the translational vector @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "the chiral and translational vectors thus represent the tube unit cell . in the boltztrap calculation",
    ", we use a @xmath43 supercell , where @xmath44 ( in nm ) is the length of the translational vector .",
    "a large supercell length in the @xmath45- and @xmath46-directions is chosen so as to guarantee the individual swnts are well - separated .",
    "since the thermopower in the boltztrap code is expressed in terms of a tensor  @xcite , the corresponding thermopower tensor component for a given s - swnt is @xmath47 , which is the thermopower along the tube axis direction .",

    "we see that the thermopower is higher at the lower temperature because @xmath49 in eq .  .",
    "the maximum thermopower obtained for the @xmath48 swnt is about @xmath50 , which is already large for a purely individual s - swnt compared to that for bundled swnts with @xmath7 of around @xmath19  @xcite .",

    "the optimum value of the thermopower , indicated by a maximum ( minimum ) along the negative ( positive ) axis of the chemical potential , arises due to the p - type ( n - type ) characteristics of the s - swnts , which is consistent with a recent experimental observation  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the thermopower on the chemical potential implies that it is possible to tune the thermoelectric properties of s - swnts by applying a gate voltage , giving p - type and n - type control over the thermopower .    to better understand the numerical results of thermopower",

    "in particular , the two optimum thermopower values ( maximum and minimum for p - type and n - type doping , respectively ) can be well - reproduced in that region , which implies that the energy bands near the fermi energy give the strongest contribution to the thermopower of s - swnts .",
    "the analytical results deviate from the numerical results at larger @xmath60 far from the optimum thermopower because the two - band model is no longer valid at a higher doping level .",

    "the reason is that the electrical conductivity @xmath8 can be very small near @xmath59 .",
    "this fact is also reflected in the conductivity equation as a function of @xmath26 [ see appendix b , eq .",
    "however , compared to the bulk materials , the one - dimensional materials such as s - swnts have smaller effective mass @xmath99 , which may enhance the electrical conductivity due to the relation of @xmath100 , as can also be seen in eq .  .",
    "second , we may worry that , as we go to smaller diameter s - swnts ( in which the thermopower is optimized ) , the electrical conductivity will instead be too small to maximize the power factor .",
    "however , we note that there is also a chirality dependence which could enhance the electrical conductivity through the effective mass relation . as mentioned before",
    ", a smaller @xmath99 will give a larger @xmath8 , and thus s - swnts which have both small diameters and small @xmath99 might be useful as a thermoelectric material even at relatively low doping levels .",
    "we have shown the theoretically predicted behavior of the thermopower of many s - swnts within a diameter range of @xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "we derive a simple formula to calculate the thermopower of s - swnts from their band gap , which enables us to predict the optimum thermopower values",
    ". the optimum thermopower value of an individual s - swnt ( p - type or n - type ) can be larger than @xmath3 at room temperature for diameters less than @xmath2 , such as the @xmath93 and @xmath94 s - swnt .",
    "our results highlight potential properties of small diameter s - swnts as a one - dimensional thermoelectric material with a giant thermopower . with the recent advances in the fabrication methods for specific small diameter s - swnts  @xcite",
