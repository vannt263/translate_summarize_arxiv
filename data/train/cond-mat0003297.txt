    "the strength and importance of electron - lattice phonon ( _ e  lph _ ) coupling in the superconductivity mechanism of organic superconductors has always been rather controversial .",

    "@xcite carbon isotopic substitution on the central double bond was claimed to have dramatic effects on the @xmath5 of one superconducting salt,@xcite but subsequent extensive isotopic substitution studies on other superconducting salts strongly suggested that the lattice phonons are likely involved in the superconducting mechanism.@xcite attempts to take into account both _",

    "the phonon modes obviously differ for different crystalline structures .",
    "we have tackled the problem by adopting the `` quasi harmonic lattice dynamics '' ( qhld ) method,@xcite by which we are able to analyze both the crystal and the lattice phonon structure in terms of empirical atom - atom potentials , in principle transferable among crystals containing the same atoms .",
    "we have first obtained c , s and h atom - atom potential parameters reproducing crystal structure and lattice phonons of neutral .@xcite then we have considered the i@xmath6 salts , which have only one additional atom to parametrize , and present several crystalline phases.@xcite after the successful application of the potential to non - superconducting crystal , @xcite we present in this paper the results relevant to the extensively studied superconducting @xmath0-phases .",

    "several variants of the phase have been reported , making difficult a full and detailed characterization .",
    "the electrochemically prepared exhibits ambient pressure superconductivity at @xmath5= 1.3 k ( @xmath7- ) or at @xmath5=8.1 ( @xmath8- or @xmath9- ) depending on the pressure - temperature history of the sample .",
    "such @xmath5 increase has been attributed to a pressure induced ordering process of the ethylene groups of cation.@xcite in addition , thermal treatment or laser irradiation of the @xmath10-phase yields an irreversible transformation to a superconducting phase ( @xmath5= 8.0 k ) , named @xmath11-,@xcite which was claimed to be similar to the @xmath0-phase . on the other hand , can also be prepared by direct chemical oxidation ( @xmath12-),@xcite with @xmath5 between 7.1 and 7.8 k. recent x - ray data confirm that thermally treated is identical to @xmath12-,@xcite but it is still not clear whether @xmath12- is the same as @xmath8- : the possibility of non - stoichiometric phases has also been put forward as an alternative to the ordering process in causing a @xmath5 of about 8 k.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first discuss in some detail the methods we have adopted to calculate the structure , the phonon dynamics and the _ e  lph _ coupling strength of salts .",
    "the results relevant to the phase are then presented and compared with available experimental data . finally , the possible role of electron - phonon coupling in the pairing mechanism of organic superconductors is briefly discussed .",

    "the choice of the initial lattice structure is somewhat problematic , due to the conformational disorder of the molecules .",
    "in fact , the x - rays structural investigations @xcite indicate that at 120 k is disordered with two alternative sites for the terminal c atoms , labeled 9a,10a ( staggered form ) and 9b,10b ( eclipsed form ) . on the other hand , _ ab  initio _ calculations @xcite for neutral indicate that the `` boat '' geometry ( @xmath22 symmetry ) is more stable than the `` planar '' geometry ( @xmath23 symmetry ) by 0.65 kcal / mole .",

    "ii , at first we have made calculations with rigid molecules , and then we have relaxed the rma with the addition of a subset of _ intra_molecular modes .",
    "the crystal structure is only marginally affected by rma and in table ii we report the comparison between rma - calculated and experimental crystal structure@xcite at several temperatures and pressures .",
    "1 reports a more extensive and direct comparison between calculated and experimental crystal axis lengths against @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",

    "the effect of the change in molecular geometry is negligible . at all temperatures ,",
    "appears to be thermodynamically more stable than , @xcite giving account for the irreversible interconversions of into @xmath0like phases .",
    "the effect of molecular deformations has been investigated , within the rma approximation , by testing several model geometries in as well as in phases .",
    "the potential energy has been minimized with the experimental geometries@xcite and with chair-@xmath10 , chair-@xmath0 , boat-@xmath10 and boat-@xmath0 model geometries .",

    "it should be noticed that for the boat-@xmath0 geometry coincides with the experimental geometry at 4.5 k , and thus yields the lowest energy .",
    "the difference between and essentially vanishes if the chair-@xmath10 and boat-@xmath10 geometries are used in the @xmath0phase , while the chair-@xmath0 and boat-@xmath0 geometries drastically destabilize the @xmath10phase .",
    "this behavior clearly indicates that molecular deformations play a crucial role in stabilizing the various phases .",
    "we next turn our attention to the phonon structure . in the @xmath0phase",
    "we have only one formula unit in the triclinic unit cell , and within rma we expect 8@xmath78 and 6@xmath106 @xmath107 lattice phonons active in raman and in ir , respectively . the number of phonons experimentally observed in the 10 - 150 @xmath71 spectral region is in any case smaller than the above prediction , so vibrational spectra do not offer a very stringent test of the calculations . on the other hand , there is another observable , the specific heat , which depends on the frequency distribution . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , at 20 k the @xmath37 calculated within rma ( dotted line ) is about 50% smaller than the experimental @xmath108 ( dots , from ref . ) .",
    "the difference between @xmath37 and @xmath108 is usually small for solids , since their thermal expansion is small .",
    "therefore , we attribute most of the discrepancy between @xmath37 and @xmath108 to the _ intra_molecular modes , which are neglected in the rma calculation .",
    "_ ab  initio _ calculations @xcite indeed indicate the presence of several low - frequency _ intra_molecular ( internal ) normal modes .",
    "since calculations refer to a free molecule , a direct comparison with experimental data in the solid state is not feasible .",
    "however , they constitute a very convenient starting point for relaxing rma in qhld calculations , as explained in section ii .",
    "we have included the lowest nine internal modes which fall in the same spectral region as the lattice modes ( below @xmath109 220 @xmath71),@xcite and therefore are likely coupled .",
    "in addition , the symmetric and antisymmetric stretchings , and the two bendings of i@xmath6 , expected at 114 , 145 , 52 and 52 @xmath71 , respectively,@xcite have been included in the qhld calculations .",

    "the agreement with experiment is greatly improved with respect to rma calculations .",
    "we anticipate that the same kind of result has been obtained for , @xcite and conclude by stating that rma has to be relaxed for a realistic calculation of the low - frequency phonons of crystals .",
    "we now go back to the characterization of individual low - frequency phonons . in the rma classification , below 220 @xmath71",
    "we expect raman activity for 8 lattice modes , 9 _",
    "intra_molecular modes and one stretching of i@xmath6 ; in ir we expect 6 lattice modes , 9 _ intra_molecular modes and three i@xmath6 modes .",
    "the modes calculated at the minimum @xmath105 structure at 120 k are compared with experimental ones,@xcite in tables iii and iv for @xmath106 and @xmath78 modes , respectively .",

    "the frequency differences between minimum @xmath105 and experimental structure are quite small .",
    "the comparison between calculated and experimental vibrational frequencies is satisfactory , although not very significant given the low number of observed frequencies .",
    "since we also have all the corresponding eigenvectors , we report an approximate description of the phonons , given for both and i@xmath6 as percentage of the lattice ( rigid molecule ) and of the _ intra_molecular contributions .",

    "we have limited the highest frequency to 150 @xmath71 .",
    "3 puts in evidence the complex structure of low - frequency phonons .",
    "we have a very dense grouping of modes in the 50 - 100 @xmath71 region , with several avoided crossings between the dispersion curves , and clear mixing between lattice and molecular modes .",
    "only the acoustic phonon branches contribute to the density of states below @xmath109 25 @xmath71 , so that the typical @xmath110 dependence is observed . on the other hand , at energies higher than @xmath111 140 @xmath71 the almost dispersionless _",
    "intra_molecular modes dominate , and the phonon density of states appears as a sum of delta - like peaks ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the _ e  lph _ coupling constants for the optical phonons of are reported in table iv . as explained in section",
    "ii , if one assumes that the eigenvectors are independent of @xmath36 , only the @xmath78 phonons can couple to electrons . in table iv for each phonon we report both the individual @xmath112 ( eq .",
    "5 ) and the small polaron binding energy @xmath113 .",
    "the two most strongly coupled modes are those calculated at 32 and 113 @xmath71 . whereas the former mode has been observed in the raman spectrum , and together with the lower frequency mode ( 27 @xmath71 ) undergoes a drastic intensity weakening at @xmath5,@xcite the latter has not been reported even in the normal state.@xcite the reason might be due to the proximity of the very intense , resonantly enhanced band at 121 @xmath71 , due to the symmetric stretch of the i@xmath6 anion .",
    "one band at 107 @xmath71 has been observed below 6 k for 488 nm laser excitation.@xcite on the other hand , a band at 109 @xmath71 , whose intensity varies with sample and irradiation , has been attributed to the splitting of the i@xmath6 stretching mode,@xcite as a consequence of the commensurate superstructure reported in one x - ray investigation at 100k.@xcite certainly the 100 - 130 @xmath71 spectral region deserves further experimental scrutiny with the latest generation of raman spectrometers .",
    "a second observation is that whereas the 113 @xmath71 mode involves only the units , and is mostly a lattice mode , the 32 @xmath71 one is a mixing between rigid i@xmath6 motion and `` flexible '' vibrations .",
    "this finding suggests a not marginal role of the counter - ions sheets in @xmath114type salts .    as shown by table iv ,",
    "the coupling of individual optical modes with electrons is in general not particularly strong , but on the whole the strength of _ e  lph _ coupling , as measured by the sum of the @xmath113 , is appreciable , around 45 mev , to which we have to add the contribution of the acoustic phonons . for the sake of comparison , we give also the @xmath82 for the three acoustic branches , calculated as average over several points at the bz edges . in order of decreasing phonon frequency ( see fig .",
    "3 ) the @xmath115 are : 2.3 , 3.3 and 18.2 mev , respectively .",
    "the coupling strength of the lowest acoustic branch at the zone edge is comparable to that of the most strongly coupled optical phonons .",
    "thus the overall _ e - lph _ coupling strength is of the same order of magnitude as that due to _ e  mv _ coupling , about 70 mev.@xcite    we can make a more direct connection with superconducting properties by calculating the eliashberg function and the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath3 . as seen in eq .",
    "( 6 ) , the absolute value of the eliashberg function depends on the electronic density of states at the fermi energy , @xmath95 .",
    "experimental estimates of this critical parameter are problematic , since the measured quantities already include or the @xmath3 enhancement factor , or the coulomb enhancement factor , or both .",
    "the available theoretical estimates are all based on the extended hckel tight binding method .",
    "the choice of @xmath95 = 2.1 spin states / ev / unit cell , as obtained by this method,@xcite is consisten with our extended hckel estimates of the ct integrals in real space .",
    "to our advantage , we can compare the calculated @xmath2 with that derived from normal state current / voltage measurements at a point contact junction.@xcite this kind of experiment is rather difficult to perform on organic crystals like , since one has to be careful about pressure effects at the point contact .",
    "the use of a contact between two crystals made the current - voltage characteristics rather stable , from which the @xmath2 function reported in the upper part of fig . 4 was obtained.@xcite we have changed the scale on the ordinate axis to maintain the same energy unit ( @xmath71 ) throughout .",
    "it is clear that the spectral resolution of the experiment is larger than @xmath109 10 @xmath71 , and probably increases with energy .",
    "indeed , no spectral detail is visible beyond 240 @xmath71 , where the contribution of _ e  mv _ coupled modes should be detectable.@xcite therefore , to make easier the visual comparison with the experimental data , we have smoothed the calculated @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "4 , lower part ) by a convolution with a gaussian distribution .",
    "we have also assumed that the gaussian distribution width increases linearly with @xmath89 ( from 0.1 to 20 @xmath71 in the 1 - 200 @xmath71 interval ) .",
    "4 puts in evidence the very good agreement between experiment and calculation .",
    "the absolute scale of @xmath2 turns out to be practically the same , even if both experiment and calculation are affected by considerable uncertainties , as explained above .",
    "the three main peaks observed in the experiment are well reproduced and are identified as due to the most strongly coupled phonon branches , namely , the optical phonons at 113 and 32 @xmath71 , and the lowest frequency acoustic branch . the calculated peak frequency due to",
    "the latter is slightly higher than the experimental one ( 22 vs 10 @xmath71 ) .",
    "this discrepancy might be due to the fact that the experiment refers to the @xmath7- phase , whereas our calculation refers to a perfectly ordered phase like the @xmath9-.@xcite we also remark that , at variance with traditional superconductors , the eliashberg function is remarkably different from the phonon density of states ( fig .",
    "3 ) . for instance",
    ", the peak around 120 @xmath71 in @xmath87 is due to the dispersionless i@xmath6 stretching mode , which is completely decoupled from the electron system , whereas the broad peak in @xmath2 is due to the nearby ( 113 @xmath71 `` lattice '' mode of the molecules . due to the complex phonon structure , @xmath116 is not nearly constant , but varies rapidly with the frequency .",
    "the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath3 obtained by integration of @xmath117 up to 240 @xmath71 turns out to be around 0.4 .",
    "the contribution to @xmath3 from _ e  mv _ coupled modes@xcite is instead around 0.1 .",
    "thus in the mcmillan picture the overall @xmath3 of @xcite is @xmath109 0.5 , which may well account for the observed @xmath118 k.@xcite",
    "the computational methods we have adopted to analyze the crystal and lattice phonon structure , and the electron - phonon coupling strength of are empirical or semiempirical . the form of qhld atom ",
    "atom potentials has no rigorous theoretical justification , and the corresponding parameters are derived from empirical fittings .",
    "we have adopted _ ab  initio _ atomic charges@xcite to take into account coulomb interactions between atoms , and _ ab  initio _ vibrational eigenvectors@xcite to introduce the coupling between lattice and molecular modes . also the extended hckel method used to characterize the electronic structure is semiempirical , albeit with an experimental basis far wider than qhld . in view of the obvious limitations of empirical or semiempirical methods ,",
    "the success achieved in the case of is even beyond our expectations , also considering that _ none _ of the empirical parameters has been adjusted to fit experimental data .",
    "indeed , _ all _ the available experimental data have been accounted for . the crystal structure , and its variation with temperature and pressure , is correctly reproduced ( fig . 1 and table ii )",
    ". useful hints about the relative thermodynamic stability of @xmath10 and @xmath0 phases have been obtained , as well as some indications on the effect of conformation of the phases stability . the specific heat ( fig .",
    "2 ) and the few detected raman and infrared bands have been accounted for by including the coupling with low - frequency molecular vibrations . finally , the point contact eliashberg spectral function has been satisfactorily reproduced ( fig .",
    "4 ) .    despite the success , it is wise to keep in mind the qhld limitations .",
    "first and foremost , conformational disorder in the crystal structure is not included .",
    "this is not a limitation of the qhld method only , but it is a serious one particularly for salts , where disorder plays an important role even in the superconducting properties .",
    "it is in fact believed that a fully ordered structure is at the origin of the higher @xmath5 ( 8.1 k ) displayed by @xmath9- or @xmath8- phases with respect to @xmath7 ( 1.5 k).@xcite furthermore , even if the qhld method is able to follow the @xmath21 and @xmath20 dependence of the crystal structure , phase transitions implying subtle structural changes may be beyond its present capabilities , even for fully ordered structures .",
    "the relative stabilities of the phases can indeed be reproduced only at a qualitative level . for what concerns the electron - phonon coupling",
    ", one has to keep in mind that it depends on phonon eigenvectors , and these are obviously more prone to inaccuracies than the energies .",
    "finally , extension to other salts with counter - ions different from i@xmath6 is not obvious , requiring additional atom - atom parameters .",
    "once the above necessary words of caution about the method are spelled out , we can underline what in any case have learned from the present qhld calculations .",
    "so far , in the lack of any description , no matter how approximate , of the phonons modulating the ct integrals , only speculative discussions about their role in the superconductivity could be put forward , catching at best only part of the correct picture .",
    "one of the most important indications coming out from the present paper is the need of relaxing the rma .",
    "so from one side we can not try to focus on the isolated molecule _",
    "intra_molecular vibrations presumably modulating the ct integral,@xcite and on the other side that the `` librations '' of the rigid molecules @xcite lack of precise meaning .",
    "in other words , there is no simple or intuitive picture of the phonons modulating the ct integrals .",
    "our results , and the overall mode mixing , suggest that also the counter - ions vibrations may play a perhaps indirect role in the coupling .",
    "the results of the present paper definitely assess the very important role played by the low - frequency phonons in the superconducting properties of salts .",
    "_ both _ acoustic and optic modes modulating the ct integral are involved .",
    "the overall dimensionless coupling constant is @xmath4 , much larger then that due to it e  mv coupled phonons ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "of course , a mere numerical comparison of the two @xmath3 s is not particularly significant , since one has to keep in mind the very different time scales ( frequencies ) of the two types of phonons .",
    "the phonons appreciably modulating the ct integrals fall in the 0 - 120 @xmath71 spectral region ( table iv ) , whereas those modulating on - site energies have frequencies ranging from 400 to 1500 @xmath71.@xcite applicability of the migdal theorem to the latter appears dubious : non - adiabatic corrections@xcite or alternative mechanisms such as polaron narrowing@xcite have been suggested .",
    "for these reasons we will not get involved into detailed discussions about the relative role of _ e  lph _ and _ e  mv _ coupling in the superconductivity mechanism .",
    "we limit ourselves to state that phonon mediated coupling can well account for the observed critical temperature of the ordered phase , given plausible values of the other fundamental parameter , the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath120.@xcite    the results of the present paper suggest that phonon mediated mechanism is responsible for the superconductivity of -based salts .",
    "the same conclusion was reached on the basis of the solution of the bcs gap equation for @xmath97 phase salts.@xcite on the other hand , evidences are also accumulating towards non - conventional coupling mechanisms in organic superconductors , such as spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity.@xcite similar apparently contrasting experimental evidences are also found for cuprates,@xcite pointing to a superconductivity mechanism where _ both _ electron - phonon coupling and antiferromagnetic spin correlations are taken into account .",
