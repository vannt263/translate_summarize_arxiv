    "the atlas and cms have observed the higgs boson @xcite and up to now the measurements of higgs properties consist with the standard model ( sm ) predictions .",
    "however , the sm suffers from the so - called naturalness problem @xcite which inspires theorists to propose various new physics models . among these new physics models the natural susy @xcite satisfied the naturalness criterion perfectly .",
    "it needs a light stop sector and a weak scale higgsino mass @xmath11 .",
    "the stop sector in the natural susy has been discussed extensively @xcite .",
    "the weak scale higgsino in the natural susy results in the existence of at least two light neutralinos and a pair of charginos at the weak scale .",
    "if the lighter one of the two neutralinos is the dark matter , the dark matter relic density would be far below the observed one because a higgsino like dark matter usually has large annihilation cross section to the sm particles .",
    "however if the bino is the lsp , then the dark matter is bino like and has some higgsino component , the dark matter relic density could much easier to be satisfied .",
    "so searching for such kinds of electroweakinos would directly probe the dark matter sector and the naturalness of susy .    generally , the search strategies depends on the spectrum of electroweakinos .",
    "if the electroweakinos are highly degenerate at low energy , they could be probed by the mono - jet , mono - photon or mono-@xmath12 in the future experiments @xcite .",
    "one such case is , at weak scale , only the higgsinos are light . in this case , the mono - jet signal can search higgsinos to 150 gev at 2@xmath13 level at 14tev lhc with luminosity @xmath14 .",
    "if the mass splitting between the electroweakinos is moderate , they can be probed through multi - soft leptons @xcite .",
    "recently , some authors also proposed a new channel @xmath15 to probe the region with a small splitting between the higgsinos and bino @xcite .",
    "the photon in the final state comes from the @xmath16 decaying into @xmath17 plus a photon , and the two leptons come from the other neutralino decaying into lsp via a virtual @xmath12 boson .",
    "when the splitting between the two neutralinos is small , the branching ratio of @xmath18 is considerable .",
    "so , another signal @xmath19 from neutralino / chargino pair production may be also accessible at the future lhc @xcite .    if the electroweakinos have a large mass splitting , the multi - leptons final state from chargino / neutralino pair production has the highest sensitivity @xcite .",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations performed such a study and gave the mass limits @xmath20 gev ( atlas ) @xcite and @xmath21 gev ( cms ) @xcite assuming the chargino / neutralino decays via intermediate gauge bosons and the lsp is almost massless . but",
    "this limit depends on the component of chargino / neutralino . in the experiment ,",
    "a wino nlsp and bino lsp are assumed and thus the pair produced chargino / neutralino are wino - like .",
    "the limit would be changed if the nlsp is higgsino .",
    "one reason is that the cross section of chargino / neutralino production in the wino nlsp case is larger than the one in the higgsino case .",
    "the other reason is that in the realistic spectrum , the decay branching ratio of @xmath22 is not 100% since @xmath23 could decay into @xmath24 .    in the present work , we focuses on the lsp bino and nlsp higgsino case .",
    "we also require the wino decoupled .",
    "such kinds of spectrums can be realized in the non - universal gaugino masses models .",
    "we reinterpreted the experiments results in the realistic spectrum , and give the prospect of detecting this signal in the future lhc experiments .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we scan the parameter space , and the properties of the surviving parameter space are investigated . in sec .",
    "iii , we reinterpret the experimental limits on the parameter space . in sec .",
    "iv , the prospect of detecting this signal in our surviving space are studied .",
    "in this section , we scan the parameter space in the frame of natural susy with a light bino .",
    "some survived samples are shown , which are susceptible to the 3@xmath25 experiment and possible closed by future direct search results .",
    "the parameter space are scanned in the following region : @xmath26 where the lower bound of @xmath27 avoids the chargino search limit and upper bound satisfies the naturalness requirement .",
    "other parameters , except for the stop sector , are fix at 2 tev .",
    "the stop sector are scanned in this region , @xmath28 where the lower bound avoids the direct stop search limit and the upper bound keeps the naturalness of the susy .    the following constraints are considered in the scan :    * the sm - like higgs mass is required to within the range of 123127 gev .",
    "we use @xcite to calculate the higgs mass , and impose the experimental constraints from lep , tevatron and lhc by @xcite . *",
    "we require our samples to satisfy various b - physics bounds at 2@xmath13 level .",
    "we use @xcite to implement the constraints , including @xmath29 and the latest measurements of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . * the susy prediction of the precision electroweak observable , such as @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite ,",
    "are required to be within the @xmath37 ranges of the experimental values .",
    "* a light bino in the natural susy would mix with the higgsino , which induces three neutralinos and a pair of charginos .",
    "the lightest neutralino acts as the dark matter candidate .",
    "so the relic abundance and the direct search of the dark matter set limit on the parameter space .",
    "here we require the thermal relic density of the lightest neutralino ( as the dark matter candidate ) is under the 2@xmath13 upper limit of the planck value @xcite .",
    "we use the code @xcite to calculate the relic abundance and dm - nucleon scattering",
    ".     upper limit of planck .",
    "the red pentagrams locate within the 2@xmath13 range of planck , @xmath38 , where a 10% theoretical uncertainty is included .",
    "the dm - nucleon scattering cross section has been scaled by a factor @xmath39 .",
    ", width=576,height=288 ]    figure [ fig1 ] shows the dark matter properties in the surviving space .",
    "the left panel scatters the relic abundance of the surviving samples .",
    "we can see that there are two regions left both of which have a bino like dark matter , requiring the 2@xmath13 upper limit of the planck value @xcite .",
    "the first region corresponding a lighter dark matter mass lying in @xmath40 near half of the z boson mass . in the other region ,",
    "the dark matter mass lies in @xmath41 gev near half of the higgs mass .",
    "it is easy to explain it .",
    "usually , a bino lsp has a small annihilation cross section and thus it is easy to get a large relic density .",
    "if there is a particle in the s - channel , the annihilation cross section can be raised through resonance enhancement and thus the relic abundance are reduced .",
    "it requires that the dark matter mass is around half of the boson mass . in our spectrum , only the @xmath12 boson or the higgs boson can play this role .",
    "we should note there are points satisfying the 2@xmath13 range of planck .",
    "these points could get the correct relic abundance due to joint effect of the resonance and the mixing between bino and higgsino @xcite .",
    "the right panel shows the limit of dark matter direct search .",
    "it tells that the @xmath42 resonance region easily get rid of the lux @xcite constraint , due to the moderate spitting between bino and higgsino .",
    "the future xenon-1 t",
    "( 2017 ) will exclude large parameter space of this region , but a small fraction can still survived when dark matter mass is very close to half the @xmath12 mass or higgs mass .",
    "it should be noted the some points within the 2@xmath13 range of planck still survived the lux search .",
    "but they are possibly covered by future dark matter direct search xenon-1 t ( 2017 ) .",
    "so , in the following , we concentrate on the points which are still survived under limits from the dark matter experiments .",
    "although in this region , a correct relic abundance could be derived by elaborately tuning the neutralino mass , we just take the dark matter relic abundance as an upper limit here .",
    "at lhc , the atlas and cms collaborations have separately preform the @xmath43 searches @xcite .",
    "they aims at the @xmath44 pair production following by decays @xmath22 , @xmath45 ( the @xmath46 and @xmath12 can be virtual ) , and then the @xmath46/@xmath12 decays producing 3 leptons in the final state . in this paper , we use the atlas experiment result to constrain our parameter space .",
    "the atlas experiment@xcite defines six signal regions aiming at @xmath12-depleted region and @xmath12-enriched region .",
    "table [ tab1 ] shows the selection requirements of these six signal regions .",
    "we can see that srnoz(a , b , c ) concentrate on the @xmath12-depleted case where the invariant mass of the sfos lepton pair departs the @xmath12-boson mass .",
    "conversely , in the other three regions , a @xmath12 boson is required in the mediate state .    through the analysis",
    ", the experiments give an exclusion region on the @xmath47 plane and the exclusion limit can reach 320 gev . results this limit reaches 345 gev .",
    "we carefully check the difference between the old one and the latest one , and find that the cut efficiency is not improved significantly and the latest result is also hard to implement because twenty signal regions are defined .",
    "] it should be noted that in the experiments a wino like nlsp and bino lsp are assumed and the decay branching ratio of @xmath22 and @xmath45 are set to be 100% .    in the higgsino nlsp case ,",
    "not only the @xmath16 , bust also the @xmath48 contributes to the signals .",
    "even so , the total cross section is still about half of the one in the wino case .",
    "so we should carefully implement the @xmath43 experiments on our parameter space ; in the present work , we use the monte carlo simulation .",
    "@xcite are adopted to generate events , the parton shower is carried out by @xcite , and @xcite are used to simulate the @xmath43 experiments events .",
    "finally , we combine the simulation results from the six signal regions and derive the final exclusion limit . at the beginning",
    ", we checked the reliability of our simulation with the benchmark points provided by atlas paper ; we found them well consistent .",
    "figure 2 shows our limit assuming a 100% branching ratio of @xmath22 and @xmath49 .",
    "we can see the limit can reach utmost 250 gev when the lsp is near to 0 gev , comparing to the limit 320 gev in the wino case .",
    "it also tells when the lsp becomes heavy , the limit reduces rapidly .",
    "this figure is also consistent with similar figures provided by other authors@xcite .",
    "we should note that there is a part where the limit is not effective .",
    "it locates around @xmath50 @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 @xmath53 gev .",
    "it can be explained as follows .",
    "when the splitting of @xmath16 and @xmath17 is just larger than the @xmath12 mass , this kinematics is very similar to the one of @xmath54 background and thus its backgrounds are relatively large .",
    "then this region has a small probing efficiency .",
    ".the selection requirements for the six signal regions .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    for the signal , the cross section are calculated using @xcite .",
    "we implement the same cuts on the signal and backgrounds .",
    "the following formulas are adopted to calculate the significance @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number of signal events and @xmath57 is the total number of background events .",
    "we also considered 10% sys .",
    "error in the estimation .",
    "we present the final results in fig .",
    "it shows that the region with @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be covered at @xmath8 level .",
    "some parameter space can reach the @xmath60 discovery level .",
    "we note here the points satisfying the 2@xmath13 range of planck would be easily covered at @xmath37 level .",
    "a tiny part of the parameter space is under @xmath37 because it locates at the region where the kinematics similar to the @xmath54 background .",
    "however , if the luminosity increases , this region would be more squeezed .    .",
    "the pentagrams on the plot satisfying the 2@xmath13 range of planck .",
    ", width=384,height=288 ]    finally , we stress that our analysis is performed in the framework of mssm . in some extensions of the mssm , such as the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) which seems to be more favored by the lhc higgs data @xcite",
    ", the neutralino lsp may have a significant singlino component and thus can be very light @xcite .",
    "then the @xmath0 production may have different signatures .",
    "motivated by the naturalness , we study a simplified mssm scenario where only the bino - like lsp and higgsino - like nlsp are light .",
    "we first scan the parameter space of this scenario , considering the constraints from the higgs mass , flavor physics , electroweak precision measurements and dark matter experiments . then in the allowed parameter space",
    ", we perform a monte carlo simulation for the @xmath0 production followed by @xmath1 and @xmath2 . by examining the presently available trilepton bounds on the wino - like chargino / neutralino",
    ", we find that only a narrow region @xmath3 and @xmath4 on the plane of @xmath5 can be excluded . finally , we explore the potential of trilepton signature in probing such a scenario at 14 tev lhc and find that the region with @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be covered at @xmath8 level with luminosity @xmath9 fb@xmath10 .",
