    "within the sample of unidentified @xmath9-ray sources found in the first survey of our galaxy , ax j1838.0 - 065 is particularly interesting due to its likely physical association with the newly discovered tev source hess j1837 - 069 ( aharonian et al .",
    "in fact , its position coincides with the center of gravity of the tev emission and therefore has been suggested by aharonian et al .",
    "( 2005a ) as the most promising counterpart candidate for hess j1837 - 069 .",
    "here , we report on integral observations of ax j1838.0 - 0655  showing substantial emission in soft @xmath9-rays , compare them with previous x - ray measurements as well as with the tev data , describe the search for counterparts at other wavebands and discuss the possible nature of the source on the basis of our findings .",
    "ax j1838.0 - 0655  is located in the scutum arm region and has been independently detected as an integral source both in guest observer data by molkov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and by bird et al .",
    "the source has been detected up to 300 kev by isgri ( lebrun et al.2003 ) , the low energy imager of ibis ( ubertini et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the observational data reported here are comprehensive of all observations from revolution 46 ( february 2003 ) to revolution 186 ( april 2004 ) for a total exposure of 840 ksec .",
    "isgri images for each available pointing were generated in 10 narrow energy bands using the isdc offline scientific analysis software osa 4.1 ( goldwurm et al .",
    "individual images were then combined to produce a mosaic of a broader band to enhance the detection significance using the procedure described in detail by bird et al .",
    "figure 1 shows the 20 - 300 kev band image of the region surrounding the source which is detected with a significance of 15.3@xmath0 at a position corresponding to r.a.(2000 ) = 18h 38 m 01.7s and dec = -06@xmath10 54 14.4  with a positional uncertainty of @xmath113 ( gross et al .",
    "fluxes for spectral analysis were extracted from fine band mosaics of all revolutions added together and analysis was performed using xspec v.11.2 .",
    "a simple power law provides a good fit to the ibis data ( @xmath12=0.6 for 5 d.o.f . ) with a photon index @xmath8=1.66@xmath60.23 and a 20 - 300 kev flux of 9 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 .",
    "the errors quoted here and subsequently , correspond to 90@xmath13 confidence level for single parameter variation .",
    "+ the flux of ax j1838.0 - 0655  for each individual pointing was also used to generate the source light curve : no flares / variations are visible in the light curve nor does the source show periodicities / pulsations .",
    "although the significance is low , ax j1838.0 - 0655  seems to be a persistent source in the ibis data .",
    "dividing the observing period into 2 segments also indicates no variation in flux : the detection significance remains at a level of 9 and 8@xmath0 in mar - may 2003 and sept - oct 2003 respectively .",
    "hess j1837 - 069 is one of 10 sources found in the hess survey of the inner regions of the galactic plane and it is located at r.a.(2000)= 18h 37 m 42.7s and dec(2000)=-06@xmath10 55 39  with a positional uncertainty in the range of 1 - 2 ( aharonian et al .",
    "the quoted angular size is 4 although the tev image ( see figure 3 of aharonian et al .",
    "2005a ) suggests more extension and a non - gaussian shape .",
    "the statistical significance of the tev detection is around 7 - 8@xmath0 ( depending if the source is taken as extended or point - like ) with a source flux above 0.2 tev of 9 @xmath1 10@xmath14 photons @xmath3 s@xmath4 : assuming a power law photon index in the range 2 - 2.5 this value corresponds to 7 - 11 @xmath1 10@xmath14 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 in the 0.2 - 10 tev band .",
    "hess j1837 - 069 is at an angular distance of about 12 from the asca source g25.5 + 0.0 ( bamba et al .",
    "2003 ) , whose nature is still unknown although the x - ray data indicate that it may be either a shell type supernova remnant ( snr ) or , alternatively , a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "its position is , however , incompatible with the tev location .",
    "the nearest pulsar to hess j1837 - 069 is psr j1837 - 06 at a distance of 7.4. this pulsar has a period of 1.9s , a distance of @xmath155 kpc , a spin down age @xmath16 of 39100 kyr and a spin down flux of 1.5 @xmath1 10@xmath17 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 .",
    "comparison between the hess and the spin down luminosities indicates that this pulsar is not sufficiently energetic to power the tev radiation ; furthermore its location is at the outskirts of the emitting region .",
    "aharonian and co - workers ( 2005a ) suggest that the most likely candidate for hess j1837 - 069 is ax j1838.0 - 0655  as it coincides with the centre of gravity of the tev source , even though it is at the border of the extension which they quoted . in figure 1 , the green circle marks the position and extension of hess j1837 - 069 and indicates the clear spatial coincidence between the ibis / isgri object and the tev source . + although an egret object , 3eg j1837 - 0606/gev1837 - 0610 ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 , lamb & macomb 1997 ) , is located nearby ( @xmath15 50 away ) , its positional uncertainty ( @xmath1511 ) is such that an association with hess j1837 - 069 is unlikely . based on the 3rd egret catalogue ( hartman et al .",

    "ax j1838.0 - 0655  was first detected in x - rays by the ipc instrument on the einstein satellite ( 2e4109/1e1835.3 - 0658 , hertz and grindlay 1988 ) at position r.a .",
    "( 2000 ) = 18h 38 m 04.2s and dec(2000 ) = -06@xmath10 55 25.1  with an associated 90@xmath19 error radius of 49 \" ( cross in figure 1 ) ; the source flux was 0.014 counts in the 0.2 - 3.5 energy band ( or @xmath15 3 @xmath1 10@xmath20 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ) . + more recently , the source has been observed by asca in the 0.7 - 10 kev range during the galactic plane survey ( sugizaki et al .",
    "2001 and bamba et al .",
    "analysis of the asca - gis images available in the heasarc database indicates that the source is point - like ( 3.6 @xmath1 2.8 fwhm , against the instrument point spread function of 3 ) although marginal extension on one side can not be ruled out .",
    "ax j1838.0 - 0655  lies close ( @xmath1520 ) to g25.5 + 0.0 and it is the brightest of 5 x - ray sources found in the region ( bamba et al .",

    "the asca best fit position is at r.a.(2000 ) = 18h 38 m 00.96s and dec(2000 ) = -06@xmath10 55 55.20  with an associated uncertainty of 1 in radius ( white circle in figure 1 ) . from the positional coincidence it is evident that the einstein , asca and ibis sources ( see figure 1 ) are indeed the same object , which is also likely to emit at tev energies .",
    "we have analysed the asca - gis spectrum obtained by combining two observations performed in october 1997 and september 1999 ; the spectrum was made using photons from a circular region of 3 radius and background corrected using data from a source free region of similar size .",
    "ax j1838.0 - 0655  is fairly bright in the 0.7 - 10 kev band with an integrated flux of 1.1 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 and a hard ( @xmath8=0.8 ) and absorbed ( n@xmath5=4@xmath1 10@xmath7 @xmath3 ) power law shape .",
    "the measured column density is in excess of the galactic value which in the source direction is 1.86 @xmath1 10@xmath7 @xmath3 ( dickey @xmath21 lockman 1990 ) .",
    "ax j1838.0 - 0655  is reported as being variable by sugizaki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) but bamba et al .",
    "( 2003 ) do not confirm this variability .",
    "our own inspection of the asca data agrees with bamba et al .",
    "( 2003 ) findings that there is no evidence for variability .",
    "+ the wide band spectrum , from 1 to 300 kev , using the combined asca / integral data , can be well fitted ( @xmath12=1.3 for 19 d.o.f . ) with an absorbed power law having a photon index of @xmath8=1.5@xmath60.2 and a total ( galactic plus intrinsic ) column density of n@xmath5=6.7@xmath61.3 @xmath1 10@xmath7 @xmath3 . to account for a cross calibration mismatch between the two instruments and/or source variability between the two observing periods ,",
    "we have introduced a constant in the fit , which when left free to vary provides a value of 1.1@xmath22 , indicating a good cross calibration between the two instruments and , more importantly , constancy in the flux between the two observing periods . the spectral energy distribution from x - rays to tev @xmath9-rays of ax j1838.0 - 0655  is shown in figure 2 together with a detail of the combined gis - isgri spectrum .",
    "+ we have also searched the heasarc archive for the presence of the source in the data of past x - ray missions and discovered an exosat / me galactic plane survey source ( gps1835 - 070 ) located at a distance of 7 ( warwick et al .",
    "1988 ) : given the positional uncertainty of the me instrument ( typically 9 for a 5@xmath0 source ) it is highly likely that ax j1838.0 - 0655  was previously detected also by exosat . a straightforward conversion from count rate to flux provides a 2 - 6 kev flux of 6.3 @xmath6 0.9 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 to be compared with an asca flux in the same band of @xmath15 0.4 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ; although this may be an indication of flux variability , the lack of imaging capability of exosat suggests possible contamination from nearby sources .",
    "ax j1838.0 - 0655  is not reported in the rosat all sky survey neither as a bright nor as a faint object , however with an upper limit which is compatible with the einstein detection .",
    "+ browsing the bepposax archive , we also found two pds pointings ( on march and april 2001 ) devoted to the study of 3eg j1837 - 0606 , which contained serendipitously also ax j1838.0 - 0655  ( malizia et al .",
    "there is a strong detection ( @xmath1513@xmath0 ) in the combined pds data .",
    "superposition of the pds error box of 1.3 degrees on the ibis map indicates that the emission is likely dominated by ax j1838.0 - 0655  , but a contribution from the nearby igr j18410 - 0535 can not be ruled out . if fitted with a simple power law ( @xmath23=7.8 for 8 d.o.f",
    "plus a constant to account for the loss in sensitivity due to the distance of ax j1838.0 - 0655  from the center of the pds pointing ( @xmath1544 ) , these data give a photon index of @xmath8=2.5@xmath24 and a 20 - 100 kev flux of 3.6 @xmath1 10@xmath2 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 , a similar flux but a steeper spectral index than isgri .",
    "although this is potentially an interesting result , the lack of imaging capability , which is crucial in the crowded regions of the galactic plane , suggests some caution in interpreting the pds ( as well as exosat ) data . instead , one important conclusion is that ax j1838.0 - 0655  has always been detected above a few kev whenever observed , strongly suggesting that it is a persistent x - ray source",
    "the visual extinction in the ax j1838.0 - 0655  direction is a@xmath25=36.3 ( from the relation by predehl and schmitt ( 1995 ) ) .",
    "this implies that any optical counterpart will be extremely weak or invisible and that the search for identification should be carried out at radio and/or infrared frequencies",
    ". inspection of various databases provides indications for the presence of a strong radio source ( 14 @xmath0 ) at the border of the isgri error box , but outside the smaller x - ray positional uncertainty of asca / einstein : txs1835 - 069-cul1835 - 06 , associated in simbad with a candidate supernova remnant , snr025.3 - 00.1 ( dulk and slee 1972 ) .",
    "this source has a size of @xmath15 5 and the radio spectrum is a power law ( s(@xmath26)=a@xmath27 ) of @xmath28 ( energy index ) equal to -1 in the 0.08 - 5 ghz range . at 1.4 ghz",
    "the source morphology is complex as txs1835 - 069 is resolved into a point - like object and a linear double ( helfand et al .",
    "1998 ) resulting in 3 objects listed in the nvss ( nrao vla sky survey ) catalogue and displayed in figure 3a . as shown in the figure all three objects are inside the isgri positional uncertainty but outside the x - ray error boxes .",
    "the extended region north - west of ax j1838.0 - 0655  coincides with a star forming complex containing yet another supernova remnant snr025.4 - 00.2 and few giant hii regions . helfand and",
    "co - authors estimate for the double source a spectral index of @xmath28@xmath29 -0.4 , while the point source has a slightly inverted spectrum at low frequencies and then declines above 1.4 ghz .",
    "they also suggest that txs1835 - 069 is likely composed of a pair of foreground extragalactic objects and is not a supernova",
    ". clearly deeper radio observations of this radio complex are required to definitely identify its true nature and eventually rule out ( or in ) any connection with ax j1838.0 - 0655  /hess j1837 - 069 .",
    "inspection of the nvss image indicates a flux limit of 1 - 2 mjy at 1.4 ghz in this region ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , implying for ax j1838.0 - 0655  a very low radio brightness compared to other tev sources ( helfand et al . 2005 ) if no connection with txs1835 - 069 will be found .",
    "+ the x - ray positional uncertainty is too large to allow a proper search for counterparts at infrared wavebands ; this is also true for the sky region which is in common to the 3 error boxes ( figure 3b ) , i.e. the most likely to contain the counterpart of ax j1838.0 - 0655  . of the many infrared candidates , one is particularly interesting as it is detected at all infrared wavelengths from 1.25 to 21.34 @xmath30 m : g025.2454 - 00.1885 which is the only msx6c ( midcourse space experiment ) object detected in the x - ray error box at r.a.(2000 ) = 18h 38 m 01.61s and dec(2000 ) = -06@xmath10 55 23.5  ( see figure 3b which is a 8.3 @xmath30 m image of the region containing ax j1838.0 - 0655 ) .",
    "this source is fairly bright in the infrared ( 1.8 jy at 8.3 @xmath30 m and @xmath150.02 jy in j band ) , but not in the optical where the b magnitude is likely to be fainter than 19 - 20 .",
    "it is unclear at this stage what is the nature of this infrared source but its brightness argues against too much reddening thus questioning the association with ax j1838.0 - 0655  .",
    "ax j1838.0 - 0655  is clearly a persistent and possibly non variable high energy source .",
    "the x/@xmath9-ray spectrum is hard and absorbed by a column density in excess of the galactic value ; the fact that we see no turn off in the soft @xmath9-ray emission up to at least 100 - 300 kev is very puzzling although it must be noted that the sensitivity of isgri at these high energies requires longer exposures to get more statistically sound results .",
    "the x - ray morphology indicates that ax j1838.0 - 0655  is more likely to be a point source rather than extended , while the tev results are more compatible with an extended region of emission .",
    "many of these features are indicative of non - thermal radiation and strongly suggest a classical tev emitter scenario , i.e. a snr and/or a pwn ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005a ) or alternatively a binary system such as psr b1259 - 63 ( aharonian et al .",
    "this last possibility does not fit with the lack of strong x/@xmath9-ray variability and the extension of the source at tev energies . on the other hand ,",
    "the constant flux and x - ray / tev morphology are more in favour of a shell type snr and/or pwn scenario .",
    "note , however , that in a shell type snr a cut off in the x - ray spectrum is expected to be well below 100 kev ( uchiyama et al . 2003 ) assuming a standard synchroton radiation model .",
    "detection of both types of snr in the x - ray band but not at radio frequencies is intriguing . however",
    ", if the snr magnetic field is weak and/or the source is far away , then the radio emission may be too faint to be detected in a shell type snr ( bamba et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) . also for pwns ,",
    "the ratio between the luminosity in x - ray and that in radio is still an open issue : there are sources of this type with x - ray luminosities similar to the crab but with radio fluxes 2 to 3 order of magnitude weaker ( slane et al . 2004 ) .",
    "finally , helfand et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have recently noticed a large range of more than 3 orders of magnitude in the radio to tev flux ratios and a preference for tev sources to show x - ray synchrotron emission . thus it may not be surprising to find both snr / pwn type of objects first in x - rays and subsequently at radio frequencies where they may be still too faint to have been picked up by current radio surveys .",
    "the possible association of ax j1838.0 - 0655  with the msx source is also unusual .",
    "this object is certainly related to thermal emission and so difficult to recoincile with ax j1838.0 - 0655  characteristics .",
    "alternatevely it may indicate a totally different scenario to explain the tev emission : for example , the interaction of a molecular cloud ( likely to be detected by the msx instrument ) either with an expanding snr shell or with the stellar winds from an ob star association are both viable sites of tev emission . in this case , however , it would be more difficult to produce the x/@xmath9-ray radiation .",
    "also the vicinity of the star forming complex visible both in radio and far - infrared is interesting as it can provide the ambient starlight photons for inverse compton scattering of the synchrotron emitting high energy electrons .",
    "bamba et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , estimate a distance of @xmath15 8 kpc for this region , a value which is consistent with the fact that the source is located in the scutum arm ( koyama et al .",
    "1991 ) . for this distance",
    ", we have x - ray , soft gamma and tev luminosities of 10 , 32 and 5.7@xmath1 10@xmath31 erg s@xmath4 respectively ; these luminosities are similar to the values observed in the few hess sources which have been clearly identified with pwns or shell type snrs ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observed values are closer to the first type of objects rather than to the second one .",
    "overall , we can conclude that all observational evidences suggest at this stage that ax j1838.0 - 0655  may well be a shell type snr or a pwn .",

    "<S> it has been detected in the past by various x - ray telescopes , including asca , implying that it is a persistent rather than a transient source ; the asca image is compatible with the source not being resolved . the broad 1 - 300 kev spectrum </S>",
    "<S> is characterized by an absorbed ( n@xmath5=6.7@xmath61.3 @xmath1 10@xmath7 @xmath3 ) and hard ( @xmath8=1.5@xmath6 0.2 ) power law continuum . </S>",
    "<S> possible counterparts ( radio and infrared ) present within the x - ray error box are discussed , even if no clear association can be identified . the broad band spectrum </S>",
    "<S> together with the tev detection suggests that ax j1838.0 - 0655   maybe a supernova remnant or a pulsar wind nebula , which has so far eluded detection in the radio band . this is the second unidentified hess source that shows a substantial soft gamma - ray emission .    . </S>"
