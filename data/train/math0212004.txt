    "in 1988 , kalai  @xcite proved a lower bound of @xmath8 for the number @xmath9 of distinct combinatorial types of simplicial pl @xmath5-spheres on @xmath2  vertices .- notation for positive functions : @xmath10 denotes that there is a positive constant @xmath11 such that @xmath12 holds for all sufficiently large @xmath2 .",
    "similarly @xmath13 if there is a @xmath14 such that @xmath15 for all large @xmath2 , and @xmath16 denotes that both conditions hold . ] combining this with goodman and pollack s  @xcite upper bound @xmath17 for the number @xmath18 of combinatorial types of simplicial @xmath5-polytopes on @xmath2 vertices , he derived that for @xmath7 , there are far more simplicial @xmath5-spheres than simplicial @xmath6-polytopes .",
    "in particular , _ most _ of these spheres , in a very strong sense , are not polytopal , i.e.  there is no convex polytope with the same face lattice . on the other hand , we proved in earlier work  @xcite that in dimension @xmath19 , kalai s construction produces only polytopal spheres , and up to now only few families of non - polytopal @xmath1-spheres were known .    in this paper , we combine two constructions from a recent paper by eppstein , kuperberg & ziegler @xcite to show for the first time that for @xmath2 large enough , there are far more simplicial @xmath1-spheres than @xmath4-polytopes on @xmath2  vertices .",
    "[ thm : many - spheres ] there are at least @xmath20 combinatorially non - isomorphic simplicial @xmath1-spheres on @xmath2 vertices .    in brief , we prove theorem  [ thm : many - spheres ] by producing a cellular decomposition  @xmath21 of  @xmath22 with @xmath2  vertices and @xmath23 octahedral facets , and triangulating each octahedron independently .",
    "the cellulation  @xmath21 is constructed from a heegaard splitting @xmath24 of  @xmath22 of high genus by appropriately subdividing the thickened boundary surface @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "because of their sheer number , _ most _ of the spheres we construct are combinatorially distinct : there can be at most @xmath26  spheres combinatorially isomorphic to any given one , where @xmath27 .",
    "also note that the only currently known upper bound for  @xmath28 is the rather crude estimate @xmath29 obtained from stanley s proof of the upper bound theorem for spheres  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath30 all simplicial @xmath5-spheres are realizable as polytopes : @xmath31-dimensional spheres are trivial to realize , and steinitz famous theorem  @xcite ,  @xcite from the beginning of the 20th century asserts that _ all _ @xmath32-spheres , including the non - simplicial ones , are polytopal ( i.e. , they arise as boundary complexes of @xmath1-dimensional polytopes ) .",
    "tutte  @xcite showed in 1980 that the number of combinatorially distinct rooted simplicial @xmath1-polytopes with @xmath2  vertices is asymptotically @xmath33 and bender  @xcite established sharp asymptotic formulas counting the number of unrooted @xmath1-dimensional polytopes .",
    "the first example  the so - called _ brckner sphere_of a simplicial sphere that is _ not _ the boundary complex of a polytope was inadvertedly found by brckner  @xcite in 1910 in an attempt to enumerate all combinatorial types of @xmath4-polytopes with @xmath34  facets . as noted in 1967 by grnbaum and sreedharan  @xcite , one of the @xmath1-dimensional complexes that brckner thought to represent a polytope is in fact _ not _ realizable in a convex way in  @xmath35 . as the ( polytopal ) complex brckner considered is simple ( any vertex is contained in exactly @xmath4  facets ) , its combinatorial dual",
    "is a simplicial @xmath1-sphere .",
    "another known ` sporadic ' example of a non - polytopal simplicial sphere is _ barnette s sphere _",
    "@xcite , which is nicely explained in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  iii.4 ) . from these two examples",
    "one can build infinite series , but apart from such sporadic families , no substantial number of non - polytopal spheres on a fixed number of vertices was known until kalai s 1988 construction .",
    "the related problem of estimating the number @xmath36 of combinatorial types of simplicial @xmath1-spheres with @xmath37  _ facets _ has attracted attention in gravitational quantum physics  @xcite .",
    "gromov  @xcite has asked whether there exists a constant  @xmath38 such that @xmath39 . by duality , this is equivalent to bounding the number of _ simple _ @xmath1-spheres on @xmath37  vertices .",
    "the problem is `` dual '' to the one we treat here , but seems to require different methods .",

    "@xmath40  is _ regular _ if all closed cells are embedded , and _ strongly regular _ if in addition the intersection of any two cells is a cell .",
    "the _ star _ of a cell  @xmath42 is the union of the closure of all cells containing  @xmath43 , and the _ link _ of  @xmath43 consists of all cells of @xmath44 not incident to  @xmath43 .",

    "in 1898 , heffter  @xcite constructed remarkable cellulations of closed orientable surfaces :    [ prop : heffter ] let @xmath50 be a prime power , and @xmath51 be any generator of the cyclic group  @xmath52 of invertible elements of the finite field  @xmath53 on @xmath54  elements .",
    "then there exists a regular but not strongly regular cellulation  @xmath55 of the closed orientable surface  @xmath56 of genus @xmath57 with @xmath46-vector @xmath58 , all of whose @xmath32-cells are @xmath59-gons . @xmath55",

    "* lemma 12 ) ) that this cellulation is regular ( all vertices in each  @xmath64 are distinct ) , neighborly ( any two vertices are connected by an edge ) , and closed ( any edge is shared by exactly two polygons ) , but not strongly regular ( any two polygons share @xmath65 vertices ) .",
    "an euler characteristic calculation yields the genus of the underlying surface  @xmath56 of  @xmath55 . by subdividing each polygon as in figure  [ fig : heffter-2 ] ( right ) ,",

    "this cellulation was independently obtained in  @xcite as an abelian covering of the canonical one - vertex cellulation of  @xmath56 .",
    "heffter s original construction involved only prime numbers .",
    "as it turns out , allowing prime powers becomes necessary for symmetric embeddings : according to biggs  @xcite , if the complete graph  @xmath66 embeds into a closed orientable surface in a symmetric way ( i.e. there exists a `` rotary '' or `` chiral '' combinatorial automorphism , see  @xcite ) , then @xmath2  is the power of a prime number , and james & jones  @xcite showed that _ any _ such embedding of  @xmath66 is actually one from heffter s family .",
    "two cellulations @xmath62 and @xmath67 are combinatorially distinct for @xmath68 : by  @xcite , the only automorphisms of  @xmath62 are induced by affine maps @xmath69 , @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
