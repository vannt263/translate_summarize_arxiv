    "since the first public release of jaxodraw-1.0  @xcite in september 2003 , the program has been continuously improved by the authors , partly motivated by the need of correcting obvious flaws and adding relevant new features , but above all by the overwhelming user feedback and encouragement by the community . during the last five years",
    ", jaxodraw has become one of the most popular tools to draw feynman diagrams , as witnessed by the number of citations and acknowledgements in scientific papers , as well as positive recommendations in public physics forums and reviews .",
    "the program is now included and packaged by default by various linux distributions and has been incorporated into large - scale physics applications like the jhepwork  @xcite framework .",
    "version 2.0 is a major upgrade which has seen a fundamental re - write of most of the jaxodraw core with respect to the 1.x line of development .",
    "the latter had already produced some major upgrades ( versions 1.1 , 1.2 and 1.3 ) with several minor bug - fix releases in between .",
    "the current document only outlines the major changes with respect to the features described in the published user guide  @xcite for jaxodraw-1.1 .",
    "the complete user guide for the current version is included in the program and may be consulted on the jaxodraw web site , see sec .",
    "[ info ] for some links",
    ".    please refer to  @xcite and to the present paper if using version 2.0 of the program .",
    "the following list gives a quick overview of the most prominent new features :    * added a plugin infrastructure .",
    "users can write plugins for custom import / export formats that can be installed independently and will be recognized by new versions of jaxodraw . * added bzier curves as drawing style .",
    "bziers can be drawn for all particle modes , including gluons and photons .",
    "* the dimensions and positions of arrows can be adjusted . * added scroll bars to the drawing area . now",
    "if an object is resized or moved beyond the current canvas size , scroll bars will appear .",
    "* added multiple undo / redo functionality .",
    "the user is not bound to a single undo operation , but can undo ( and redo ) a number of steps . * editing objects from the edit panel now has an immediate effect on the object so that editing operations can be previewed on the fly .        _",
    "due to extensive refactoring , jaxodraw-2.0 is not compatible with any earlier version of the program .",
    "in particular , xml files that were generated with earlier versions will generally not be imported correctly . _",
    "in this section we list the main changes that happened between the last released version of jaxodraw and the new version 2.0 .    [ [ general ] ] general + + + + + + +    @xmath0    jaxodraw now uses its own version of the axodraw style file , called axodraw4j.sty .",
    "this style file has to be installed separately .",
    "see app .",
    "[ axodraw4j ] for a description of axodraw4j.sty .",
    "version 2.0 has seen a number of fundamental changes in the underlying class structure of jaxodraw .",
    "these changes were motivate mainly by performance and maintainability arguments , but it implies a certain backward incompatibility as graphs that where saved / exported with older versions of jaxodraw will not be opened / imported correctly anymore .    improved memory performance which facilitates working with several graphs at the same time .",
    "several key strokes have been set to more  standard \" combinations .",
    "these include : copy ( ctrl+c ) , paste ( ctrl+v ) , cut ( ctrl+x ) , save ( ctrl+s ) , save as ( ctrl+shift+s ) , import ( ctrl+r ) , export ( ctrl+ shift+r ) .",
    "the  copy \" mode has been renamed to  duplicate \" to avoid confusion with the usual clipboard  copy \" action .",
    "svg support has been removed from the core program , it is now available as a separate plugin .",
    "the preferences are not stored in a file .jaxorc anymore , the standard java preferences api is used instead . see sec .",

    "the drawing of photons and gluons has been adjusted to use the same algorithms as the postscript code in the axodraw4j style file .",
    "different output formats are entirely consistent now , however some strange effects happen for special configurations , e.g. gluon loops with very small radii .",

    "make the symmetry of a photon arc configurable .",
    "editing objects from the edit panel now has an immediate effect on the object so that editing operations can be previewed on the fly",
    ".    added the new feature that a double click with the right mouse button on the canvas brings up the edit panel for the nearest object .",
    "the faint box method for selecting objects via a right click and drag action on the canvas has been improved . on button release",
    ", a menu will be presented with a choice of operations applicable to the current selection of enclosed objects .",
    "in particular the selected objects can be previewed , exported and/or saved .    added scroll bars to the canvas .",
    "now if an object is resized or moved beyond the current canvas size , scroll bars will appear .",
    "added multiple undo / redo functionality .",
    "the user is not bound to a single undo operation , but can undo ( and redo ) a number of steps determined by the undo depth preference ( currently limited to @xmath1 moves ) .",
    "groups can be rescaled by dragging , like all other objects .    objects with fill color can now be optionally unfilled ( only drawing their boundary ) .",
    "a grid bar has been added to the main panel which shows at a glance all the grid settings of the current tab .    the grid can now be customized .",
    "in particular several grid styles are now available : dot , cross , line and honeycomb ( the latter being available only when the grid type is set to hexagonal ) .",
    "holding down the mouse button after a center click on the canvas remove all handles that might be cluttering a graph in edit mode .",
    "arrows can be customized and arbitrarily positioned .",
    "the parameters that can be controlled are the arrow length , width and inset .",

    "different exporting formats have now different options .",
    "warning system when exporting with unsupported options .",
    "color space can be set by the user .",
    "the available options are axodraw ( coinciding with the usual colordvi color space ) and complete ( representing the complete rgb space ) . when working with the complete color space and exporting to latex / latex->eps , color conversion will be applied .",

    "edit panels are brought up in positions that avoid covering the edited object as much as possible .",
    "a lot of new preferences can be now set via the preferences panel .",
    "the copy action from different tabs has been streamlined , through the use of the faint box method .",
    "multiple files can be specified on the command line and will be opened in multiple tabs .",
    "the command line option -nosplash can now be used in order not to show the splash window on startup .",
    "the command line option convert can now be used to convert a number of jaxodraw xml files to axodraw4j tex files ( and vice versa ) without the need of bringing up the user interface .",
    "[ [ bug - fixes ] ] bug fixes + + + + + + + + +    @xmath0    fixed the bug where file operations ( open , save , import , ... ) did not work on windows if the path to the file contained whitespaces .",
    "fixed the bug that gluon loops did not close in latex output .",
    "this was a bug in axodraw.sty that is fixed in the new axodraw4j.sty .",
    "fixed the bug that double line separation and line width was defined inconsistently which led to different results in latex and postscript output .",
    "prevent various user input dialogs from going into the background and blocking the main window .",
    "fixed the bug that made jaxodraw hang if axodraw.sty was not installed or not found .",
    "the hexagonal grid strategy has been changed to make the grid uniform , not subject to rounding , which could make points drop from the grid if objects were moved .    a large number of minor bug fixes that are detailed in the changes document of the source distribution .",
    "this section only lists the new features that were added at every major release since version 1.1 , which is the version that was described in our first published description of the program  @xcite .",
    "each of the releases below also incorporated a number of bug fixes that can be tracked from the corresponding release notes .",
    "in addition , a few point releases were also made ( 1.0 - 1 , 1.3 - 1 , 1.3 - 2 ) with only minor bug fixes .",
    "@xmath0    make the mac os x readme file available from the help menu ( mac only ) .",
    "new vertex type diamond .    implemented latex text rotation ( using the pstricks package ) and rotation of postscript texts .    added default return mode .",
    "new export / preview formats svg , jpg and png .    added a dynamic zoom .    rewrote the export dialog for key - friendlyness : tab key toggles between items , space selects , escape cancels . in the export formats",
    "combobox you can choose an entry by pressing its first character or go up and down with the arrow keys .",
    "@xmath0    added a hexagonal grid .",
    "each tab can have its own grid type and size",
    ".    introduced a ` watchfile ' mode to avoid opening new windows for each preview .    introduced radio buttons in the vertex menus to indicate the currently active vertex mode .",
    "pstext now can display curly brackets like in latex : @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "several mac os x specific enhancements , eg . menu key short cuts , key short cuts for middle and right mouse button , a preference for the latex and dvips path , which allows internal latex compilation , etc .    arcs and triangular vertices",
    "are now three - point objects : they are drawn with a click for each point .",
    "the preferences panel has been restructured for a clearer layout .",
    "many more fonts are now available in pstext mode because we do not filter out fonts anymore that can not display greek characters .",
    "this section describes in more detail some of the most prominent new features of jaxodraw-2.0 with respect to the last released version .",
    "the preferences are not stored in a file .jaxorc ( in the user s home directory $ user_home/ ) anymore , the standard java preferences api is used instead .",
    "a folder $ user_home/.jaxodraw/$version/ ( in the following called $ jaxo_dir ) is used to store all program - specific information , currently there are sub - directories for log files , plugins and the user guide .",
    "the user guide is not bundled in the distributed program ( jar archive ) anymore , but created at run - time and installed into $ jaxo_dir / usrguide/. it can therefore be opened by any custom browser and be viewed locally and independently of jaxodraw .",
    "log records are now written to a rotating sequence of files in the default log directory $ jaxo_dir / log/. the logging level for the written log records is always kept at debug , only the logging level for the console output can be configured ( e.g. with the debug or quiet command - line options ) .      in version 2.0 a plugin architecture was added to jaxodraw .",
    "plugins are software components that may optionally be added to the program at runtime , ie without the need of changing or re - compiling the main program .",
    "this makes it easy to use optional features , in particuar export to uncommon formats or import of other custom file formats , while keeping the size of the main program at a minimum .",
    "in fact , the original main purpose of the plugin architecture was to draw some functionality out of the jaxodraw core .",
    "plugins are installed ( and un - installed ) using the plugin manager panel which is accessible from the options menu .",
    "once a plugin is installed , jaxodraw will automatically recognize it at start - up and the corresponding functionality will be available for the current session and subsequent sessions until the plugin is uninstalled .",
    "plugins are installed in $ jaxo_dir / plugins/.    a list of available plugins is maintained on the jaxodraw web site , currently there are plugins available for export to pdf ( portable document format ) and svg ( scalable vector graphics ) format .",
    "the most interesting consequence of the plugin architecture is that it allows anybody to write custom plugins that may be loaded by jaxodraw and used by anybody without re - compiling the main program .    as an illustration ,",
    "imagine we have a feynman diagram coded in some custom input file ( eg created by another program ) , and we would like to import this diagram into jaxodraw so that it can be edited interactively .",
    "all we have to do is write a java class that extends jaxoimportplugin and implement all the required abstract methods , the most important in this case being importgraph :    .... public class myimportjaxoplugin extends jaxoimportplugin {      protected jaxograph importgraph(inputstream inputstream )          throws jaxopluginexecutionexception      {          // return a graph read from an inputstream      } } ....    a ready - compiled plugin can then be installed by the jaxodraw plugin manager without changing anything in the main program . in particular , we can publish the plugin so other people can install and use it as well , without having to download and install a new version of jaxodraw !    for more detailed instructions and further information on writing plugins",
    "please refer to the jaxodraw web site .",
    "the jaxodraw home page is at http://jaxodraw.sourceforge.net/. it contains up - to - date information about the program , in particular links to our mailing lists and bug - tracking system .",
    "* acknowledgements *    we would like to thank all the people on the jaxodraw mailing list for their help and feedback during the testing phase .",
    "jaxodraw-2.0 uses a new latex  style file called axodraw4j.sty ( i.e. axodraw for jaxodraw ) for its latex exports which is based on j.  vermaseren s original axodraw.sty  @xcite .",
    "the name has been changed to avoid any backward compatibility issues with old documents that use the original axodraw .",
    "we describe here , from a user s perspective , how axodraw4j.sty differs from the original version .",
    "the reader unfamiliar with axodraw should therefore first refer to the documentation for the original version .",

    "lines and dashed lines can be made from bzier curves .",
    "* since there are now many more possibilities to specify a line , optional arguments to the main line drawing commands can be used to specify them in a keyword style . * a new macro named ` \\backslasharc ` is introduced for arcs and dashed arcs . * for consistency the ` \\backslashgluearc ` macro is renamed to ` \\backslashgluonarc ` , with the old macro retained as a synonym . *",
    "some bugs are corrected .",
    "the most notable one is that axodraw4j now works correctly with revtex and revtex4 . *",
    "the behavior of arcs is changed when the specified opening angle is outside the natural range . * the macros originally specified as ` \\backslashb2text ` , ` \\backslashg2text ` , and ` \\backslashc2text ` are now named ` \\backslashbtwotext ` , ` \\backslashgtwotext ` , and ` \\backslashctwotext ` .",
