    "the zee model @xcite is one of promising models of neutrino mass generation mechanism , because the model has only 3 free parameters and it can naturally lead to a large neutrino mixing @xcite , especially , to a bimaximal mixing @xcite .",
    "however , the original zee model is not on a framework of a grand unification theory ( gut ) , and moreover , it is recently pointed out @xcite that the predicted value of @xmath2 must be satisfied the relation @xmath3 for @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 the conclusion can not be loosened even if we take the renormalization group equation ( rge ) effects into consideration .",
    "the simple ways to evade the constraint ( 1.1 ) may be as follows : one is to consider @xcite that the yukawa vertices of the charged leptons can couple to both scalars @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "another one @xcite is to introduce a single right - handed neutrino @xmath8 and a second singlet zee scalar @xmath9 .",
    "also , a model with a new doubly charged scalar @xmath10 is interesting because the two loop effects in such a model can give non - negligible contributions to the neutrino masses @xcite . as another attractive model",
    ", there is an idea @xcite that in an @xmath0-parity violating supersymmetric ( susy ) model we identify the zee scalar @xmath11 as the slepton @xmath12 .",
    "then , we can obtain additional contributions from the down - quark loop diagrams to the neutrino masses , so that such a model can be free from the constraint ( 1.1 ) .",
    "however , these models have not been embedded into a gut scenario . as an extended zee model based on a gut scenario ,",
    "there is , for example , the haba - matsuda - tanimoto model @xcite .",
    "they have regarded the zee scalar @xmath11 as a member of the messenger field @xmath13 of susy - breaking on the basis of an su(5 ) susy gut .",
    "however , their model can not escape from the constraint ( 1.1 ) because the radiative masses are only induced by the charged lepton loop diagrams .    in the present paper",
    ", we will investigate an extended zee model which is based on a framework of a susy gut with @xmath0-parity violation , and which is free from the severe constraint ( 1.1 ) . usually , it is accepted that susy models with @xmath0-parity violation are incompatible with a gut scenario , because the @xmath0-parity violating interactions induce the proton decay . in order to suppress the proton decay due to the @xmath0-parity violating terms , we will introduce a discrete z@xmath1 symmetry .",
    "we identify the zee scalar @xmath11 as the slepton @xmath14 which is a member of su(5 ) 10-plet sfermions @xmath15 .",
    "then , the zee interactions correspond to the following @xmath0-parity violating interactions @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 ( \\widetilde{e}_r^{\\dagger})_k\\ ] ] @xmath19 ( \\widetilde{u}_l)_{k\\alpha}\\ ] ] @xmath20(\\widetilde{d}_l)_{k\\alpha}\\right\\ } \\ ,   \\eqno(2.1)\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and the indices @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are family- , su(5)@xmath25- and su(3)@xmath26-indices , respectively . however , in gut models ,",
    "if the interactions ( 2.1 ) exist , the following @xmath0-parity violating interactions will also exist : @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29(e_r^c)_k\\ ] ] @xmath30 ( u_l)_{k\\alpha}\\ ] ] @xmath31(d_l)_{k\\alpha } \\right\\ } \\ , \\eqno(2.2)\\ ] ] which contribute to the proton decay through the intermediate state @xmath32 .    in order to forbid the contribution of the interactions ( 2.2 ) to the proton decay ,",
    "for example , we can assume that the @xmath0-parity violating interactions occur only when the field @xmath33 of the third family is related , i.e. , we assume the interactions @xmath34 instead of the interaction ( 2.2 ) .",
    "then , the terms @xmath35 can not contribute to the proton decay . in order to realize the constraints @xmath36 we introduce a discrete symmetry z@xmath1 , which exactly holds at every energy scale , as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 take @xmath40 under the z@xmath1 symmetry . then , the z@xmath1 invariance leads to the constraints ( 2.4 ) .",
    "however , if the rge effects cause a mixing between the first and third families , the interactions ( 2.3 ) can again contribute to the proton decay .",
    "if we assume that @xmath41 and @xmath42 higgs fields @xmath43 and @xmath44 transform as @xmath45 under the z@xmath1 symmetry , the up - quark mass matrix @xmath46 is given by the form @xmath47 this guarantees that the top quark @xmath48 in the @xmath0-parity violating terms ( 2.3 ) does not mix with the other components ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) even if we take the rge effects into consideration , so that the interactions ( 2.3 ) can not contribute to the proton decay at any energy scales .",
    "on the other hand , the down - quark mass matrix @xmath51 and the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath52 , which are generated by the higgs scalar @xmath44 , have the form @xmath53 the mass matrix form ( 2.9 ) can not explain the observed masses and mixings . in order to give reasonable masses and mixings of the quarks and charged leptons",
    ", we must consider additional su(5 ) 45-plet higgs scalars , which do not contribute to the up - quark mass matrix because @xmath54 belongs to @xmath55 .",
    "then , we obtain the down - fermion mass matrices @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 denote contributions from the 45-plet higgs scalars @xmath60 and @xmath61 which transform @xmath62 and @xmath63 under the symmetry z@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "note that if we consider either @xmath60 or @xmath61 , we can not still give realistic down - fermion masses .",
    "for example , if we have @xmath64 ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) and @xmath61 , we obtain an unwelcome relation @xmath65 @xmath66 from the trace of @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain realistic down - fermion mass matrices , we need , at least , the three types of the higgs scalars @xmath64 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    however , such additional higgs scalars @xmath68 cause another problems .",
    "one is a problem of the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "this problem is a common subject to overcome not only in the present model but also in most gut models .",
    "the conventional mass matrix models based on gut scenario can not give realistic mass matrices without assuming higgs scalars more than two .",
    "for this problem , we optimistically consider that only one component of the linear combinations among those higgs scalars survives at the low energy scale @xmath69 ( @xmath70 is the electroweak energy scale ) , while other components are decoupled at @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is a unification scale ) .",
    "another problem is that the * 45 * higgs scalars can have vacuums expectation values ( vev ) at the electroweak energy scale @xmath70 , so that the z@xmath1 symmetry is broken at @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , the proton decay may occur through higher order feynman diagrams . in the conventional gut models ,",
    "it is still a current topic whether the colored components of the su(5 ) 5-plet higgs scalar can become sufficiently heavy or not to suppress the proton decay .",
    "we again optimistically assume that the colored components of the 45-plet higgs scalars are sufficiently heavy to suppress the proton decay , i.e. , that such effects will be suppressed by a factor @xmath74 .",
    "we define fields @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 as those corresponding to mass eigenstates , i.e. , @xmath78 @xmath79 and fields @xmath80 as partners of the mass eigenstates @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath82 .",
    "we define the neutrino mass matrix @xmath83 as @xmath84 therefore , a unitary matrix @xmath85 which is defined by @xmath86 is identified as the maki - nakagawa - sakata - pontecorvo @xcite neutrino mixing matrix @xmath87 .    , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    ", width=245 ]    in addition to the @xmath0-parity violating terms ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) [ ( 2.3 ) ] , we assume susy breaking terms @xmath91 ( and @xmath92 ) . for the moment",
    ", we do not consider @xmath93-@xmath94 mixing as in the original zee model .",
    "( the @xmath95 contribution to the neutrino mass matrix will be discussed in the end of this section . ) then , the neutrino masses are radiatively generated . in fig .",
    "[ radm - d ] , we illustrate the feynman diagram for the case with the down - quark loop .",
    "the amplitude is proportional to the coefficient @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 where @xmath99 are coefficients of @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",
    "similarly , we obtain the contributions from the charged lepton loops .",
    "therefore , the radiatively induced neutrino mass matrix @xmath102 is given by the following form @xmath103 where @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) are common factors independently of the families , and @xmath106    on the other hand , the contributions due to the @xmath95 - @xmath107 mixing are as follows .",
    "there are no contributions from bilinear terms @xmath108 $ ] , because we can always eliminate the contributions from @xmath109 by re - definition of the scalar @xmath110 . also , there are no contributions from @xmath111 , because @xmath112 is anti - symmetric in su(5 ) indices .",
    "however , the terms @xmath113 can cause the @xmath95 - @xmath114 mixing .",
    "these contributions affect only to the charged lepton loop diagrams .",
    "the final result which includes the @xmath115 contributions is given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 denotes the contributions due to @xmath119 [ @xmath95 denotes @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we have already assumed that only one component of the linear combinations among those higgs scalars survives at the low energy scale .",
    "then , we can regard @xmath118 as @xmath123 , so that we obtain @xmath124 as follows : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is antisymmetric tensor as well as @xmath127 , and @xmath128 note that , in this case , the third term in ( 3.7 ) has the same mass matrix form as that in the original zee model .",
    "in the susy gut scenario , there are many origins of the neutrino mass generations . for example",
    ", the sneutrinos @xmath129 can have the vev , and thereby , the neutrinos @xmath80 acquire their masses ( for example , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "although we can not rule out a possibility that the observed neutrino masses can be understood from such compound origins , in the present paper , we do not take such the point of view , because the observed neutrino masses and mixings appear to be rather simple and characteristic .",
    "we simply assume that the radiative masses are only dominated even if there are other origins of the neutrino mass generations .",
    "however , even under such the assumption , we still have many parameters as shown in the expression ( 3.7 ) . for simplicity , we assume that the contributions from the charged lepton loop are dominated compared with those from the down - quark loop , i.e. , @xmath130 , which corresponds to the case @xmath131 .",
    "( we can give a similar discussion for the case @xmath132 .",
    "in the present paper , we do not discuss which case is reasonable . ) furthermore , we neglect the third term ( @xmath95 contributions ) in ( 3.7 ) .",
    "then , the neutrino mass matrix ( 3.5 ) becomes a simple form @xmath133 hereafter , for convenience , we will normalize @xmath134 and @xmath135 as @xmath136 in the most susy models , it is taken that the form of @xmath137 @xmath138 is proportional to the fermion mass matrix @xmath139 .",
    "then , the coefficients @xmath140 are proportional to @xmath134 , so that the mass matrix ( 4.1 ) becomes @xmath141 , which is a rank one matrix .",
    "therefore , we rule out the case with @xmath142 .    for convenience ,",
    "hereafter , we assume that @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( @xmath143 ) are real . the mass eigenvalues and mixing",
    "matrix elements for the neutrino mass matrix ( 4.1 ) are given as follows : @xmath144 @xmath145 where @xmath146    as seen in ( 4.3 ) , the mass level pattern of the present model shows the inverse hierarchy as well as that of the zee model . from ( 4.3 ) , we obtain @xmath147 @xmath148    for a small @xmath0 , the mixing parameters @xmath2 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 are given by @xmath151 @xmath152 @xmath153 ^ 2 \\ , \\eqno(4.9)\\ ] ] @xmath154 = 1 -  .",
    "( 4.10 ) @xmath155    let us demonstrate that the mass matrix form ( 4.1 ) has reasonable parameters for the observed neutrino data . the atmospheric neutrino data @xcite suggests a large @xmath156-@xmath157 mixing , i.e. , @xmath158 .",
    "it is known that the nearly bimaximal mixing is derived from the neutrino mass matrix @xmath102 with @xmath159 symmetry @xcite .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath160 where @xmath161 , @xmath162 and so on",
    ". then , the parameterization ( 4.11 ) gives @xmath163 @xmath164 @xmath165",

    "@xmath170 is free from the constraint ( 1.1 ) in the original zee model , so that we can fit the value of @xmath2 with the observed value @xcite @xmath171 from the solar neutrino data by adjusting the parameter @xmath167 ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "of course , the parameterization ( 4.11 ) is taken only from the phenomenological point of view , so that the results ( 4.13)-(4.15 ) are not theoretical consequences in the present model .    from the recent atmospheric and solar neutrino data @xcite @xmath173 ev@xmath174 ev@xmath175)@xmath176",
    ", we estimate @xmath177 , and @xmath178 . the effective neutrino mass @xmath179 from the neutrinoless double beta decay experiment",
    "is given by @xmath180 , where we have used the observed value @xcite @xmath181 .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a neutrino mass matrix model based on a susy gut model where only top quark takes @xmath0-parity violating interactions and the z@xmath1 symmetry plays an essential role , so that the proton decay due to the @xmath0-parity interactions can be evaded safely .",
    "the general form of the radiatively induced neutrino mass matrix in the present model is given by the expression ( 3.7 ) .",
    "since the form ( 3.7 ) has too many parameters , we have investigated phenomenology for a simplified case ( 4.1 ) . although we have investigated the case @xmath182 [ @xmath183 is defined by ( 4.5 ) ] , the case @xmath184 is also possible .",
    "however , the purpose of the present paper is to give the general form of the radiatively induced neutrino mass matrix ( 3.7 ) under the discrete symmetry z@xmath1 .",
    "a systematic study of the mass matrix ( 3.7 ) will be given elsewhere .",
