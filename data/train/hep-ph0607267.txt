    "in the early universe , neutrinos were kept in thermal contact with the electromagnetic primordial plasma by rapid weak interactions with electrons and positrons .",
    "when the temperature dropped below a few mev , these weak processes became ineffective and the process of neutrino decoupling took place , while shortly after the @xmath3 pairs began to annihilate almost entirely into photons thus producing a difference between the temperatures of the relic photons and neutrinos .",
    "this difference can be easily calculated if we assume that neutrinos were completely decoupled when the @xmath3 pairs transferred their entropy to photons , leading to the well - known temperature ratio @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , this simplified picture should be improved since some relic interactions between @xmath3 and neutrinos exist all along the @xmath3 annihilation stage , leading to a slightly smaller increase of the comoving photon temperature and to small distortions ( at the percent level ) of the neutrino momentum distributions .",
    "presently , there exist compelling evidences for flavor neutrino oscillations from a variety of experimental data on solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrinos ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "these results are well understood by assuming that neutrinos have masses and mix , which in turn seems to point out the necessity of some new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) of fundamental interactions .",
    "interestingly , non - zero neutrino masses usually come with non - standard interactions ( nsi ) that might violate leptonic flavor and/or break weak universality .",
    "recent analyses @xcite have considered the neutral current nsi in a phenomenological way , showing that they can be bound using measurements of neutrino - electron scattering , as well as data from lep and from related charged lepton processes .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the neutrino decoupling process in presence of additional interactions between neutrinos and electrons , a possibility already noted in @xcite . in this case , neutrinos could be kept in longer contact with @xmath3 and thus share a larger amount of the total entropy transfer than in the sm . actually , if the non - standard neutrino - electron interactions were large enough , the neutrino momentum distribution would be significantly different from the standard case . in turn , this would modify the final yield of light nuclei during the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , as well as the radiation content of the universe , affecting the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the power spectrum of large scale structures ( lss ) . our goal is to calculate how the decoupling is modified taking into account nsi with couplings which are still allowed by present laboratory data , and to discuss the possibility that cosmological observations can be used as a complementary way to bound these exotic scenarios .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in sec.[nsisummary ] by describing the formalism adopted for the non - standard electron - neutrino interactions and summarize the current bounds from a variety of experimental data .",
    "we then consider the process of relic neutrino decoupling in the presence of non - standard electron - neutrino interactions , giving first an estimate by using a semi - analytical approach in sec.[sec : decoupling ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] we report the results of the full momentum - dependent numerical calculations for the neutrino spectra and the effect on the primordial @xmath1he yield and other cosmological observables .",
    "we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ conclus ] .",
    "the long - standing evidence of flavor change in atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments represents a strong indication of some new physics beyond the sm of fundamental interactions . for several years",
    "these experimental results have been interpreted in terms of neutrino masses ( flavor oscillations ) or by introducing new neutrino interactions .",
    "recently , reactor and accelerator data have confirmed that neutrino masses are indeed the main mechanism explaining the atmospheric and solar anomalies , while the role of nsi can be only sub - leading . in any case , most extended particle physics models that account for neutrino masses naturally lead to new nsi , whose value strongly depends on the model .",
    "for instance , nsi may arise from the structure of the charged and neutral current weak interactions in seesaw - type extended models @xcite .",
    "in the present analysis we will follow @xcite and assume that new physics induces nsi only through the four fermion operators @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a charged lepton or quark , but not new charged lepton physics at tree level . in particular , since we are interested in the decoupling process of relic neutrinos , we consider only the nsi related to electrons which , together with the standard weak interactions , are described by the effective lagrangian @xmath7 which contains the four - fermion terms @xmath8 for energies much smaller than the @xmath9 boson mass , as in our case , with @xmath10 the fermi constant and @xmath11 the chiral projectors .",
    "greek indices label lepton flavors ( @xmath12 ) and the @xmath9 couplings are @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    the nsi parameters @xmath15 can induce a breaking of lepton universality ( @xmath16 ) or rather a flavor - changing contribution ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "their values can be constrained by a variety of laboratory experiments , as discussed in @xcite . in what follows we",
    "summarize the present bounds and refer the reader to the analyses mentioned above for all details . when considering the bounds on the @xmath18 parameters , it is important to notice that they are usually obtained taking only one - at - a - time , or at most combining two of them ( such as the pair @xmath19 ) .",
    "this implies that the derived constraints are expected to be weaker but more robust if many nsi parameters are simultaneously included , since cancellations may occur .",
    "a remark is in order .",
    "since isospin - changing weak interactions converting neutrons into protons and vice versa are important for the bbn yields , one might wonder if it is legitimate to neglect the neutrino nsi with quarks .",
    "we argue that this approximation is well justified since , while relic neutrino distributions affect @xmath20 processes in a crucial way , vice versa is not true .",
    "the highly suppressed density of baryons with respect to electromagnetic particles ( @xmath21 ) allows one to neglect completely neutrino scattering on quarks for calculating the neutrino momentum spectrum .",
    "in addition , what contributes to the @xmath20 rates are neutrino charged - current interactions , where possible non - standard terms are severely bounded by the accurate agreement of sm calculations for several processes with the data ( e.g.  leptonic and hadronic weak decays ) . for baryon thermalization ,",
    "neutral current neutrino reactions are completely negligible with respect to electromagnetic interactions with @xmath3 and photons .",
    "also note that any tiny non - standard effect in the weak rates is effectively taken into account by our prescription of rescaling the theoretically predicted neutron lifetime to the experimentally measured value ( see @xcite for details ) .    finally , we comment on a possible role of exotic four - fermion neutrino - neutrino interactions of the kind parameterized in eq.([nsi ] ) , reporting the bounds quoted in @xcite .",
    "if only left - handed neutrinos are involved , the accurate measurement of the @xmath22boson width constrains the nsi coupling to be at most of the same strength of the neutral current ones in the sm , and thus we expect that they will have a sub - leading effect on our results ( see sec .",
    "[ numerical ] ) . instead",
    ", for nsi terms coupling left - handed to right - handed components , a stringent bbn bound of @xmath23 applies , coming from the request that more than one neutrino - equivalent degree of freedom which was thermally populated in the early universe is excluded .",
    "finally , extra interactions coupling only right - handed states might be large , but this case is of no interest for the process of neutrino decoupling .       neutrino scattering experiments    the magnitude of the nsi parameters can be constrained from the analysis of data from neutrino - electron scattering experiments , which can probe the sm electroweak predictions with good precision ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "first , we focus on @xmath24 ( data from the lsnd experiment @xcite ) and @xmath25 scattering ( data from the irvine @xcite and munu @xcite experiments ) . the total @xmath24 cross section including nsi is @xmath26 \\label{sigmatot_nue_e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the lsnd measurement is @xmath27 in @xcite this result was compared with the sm prediction @xmath28including electroweak corrections and best fit value for @xmath29to obtain the following allowed regions around the sm value , assuming only one operator at a time @xmath30 more severe bounds are obtained using radiative effects , see later . in general , the allowed region in the @xmath31 plane is an elliptic corona as given in fig .",

    "this is actually the only way to get bounds on the @xmath42 parameters from laboratory data .",
    "the approximate limits for these parameters can be extracted from fig .  3 of @xcite , @xmath43 at 99% cl when the other parameter is left free .",
    "for the @xmath44 nsi the bounds are comparable to those obtained from neutrino - electron scattering",
    ".      the non - standard neutrino - electron interactions also lead to corrections at the one - loop level to processes such as the decays of the electroweak gauge bosons or lepton flavor violating decays of charged leptons .",
    "these corrections arise from effective non - renormalizable interactions and in principle their computation requires the knowledge of the complete theory leading to these effective terms in the low - energy regime . nevertheless for @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the energy scale setting the limit of validity of the effective theory ,",
    "the leading term is independent of the specific theory and has a logarithmic behavior , @xmath47 @xcite . using conservatively @xmath48",
    ", one gets the following 90% cl bounds from the decay rates of the electroweak gauge bosons @xmath49 which are of the same order of eq .",
    "( [ bounds_tau ] ) .",
    "similarly , from the strong experimental limit on the branching ratio @xmath50 , it is possible to obtain a severe bound on the flavor changing parameter ( 90% cl ) @xmath51      after reviewing the bounds on nsi parameters , we conclude that they    * restrict the @xmath52 as shown in fig.[epsr_epsl ] ; * force the @xmath53 to be very small and negligible for the purposes of the present paper ; * allow _ large _ @xmath54 , almost of order unity , see ( [ bounds_tau ] ) ; * as far as flavor changing parameters are concerned , allow large @xmath55 , ( [ bounds_lsndfc ] ) , moderate @xmath56 , ( [ bounds_mufc ] ) , and very tiny @xmath57 , the latter being too small to have any impact on neutrino decoupling dynamics .",
    "again it is useful to remind the reader that the bounds on nsi parameters are relaxed when more than one parameter is allowed to vary simultaneously , as shown in @xcite .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the leptonic measurement of @xmath29 at a neutrino factory will be sensitive to values of the @xmath58 nsi parameters of @xmath59 .",
    "additional information on the nsi can be extracted from a consistency comparison of the results of solar neutrino experiments with those of an experiment detecting reactor neutrinos such as kamland .",
    "the former depend on the nsi parameters through the matter potential felt by solar neutrinos and/or via the neutrino neutral current detection . instead ,",
    "kamland data is essentially unaffected by the nsi . ref .",
    "@xcite found that the combination of sno and kamland data will provide bounds on the @xmath60 comparable but slightly better to those in eqs .",
    "( [ bounds_tau ] ) or ( [ bounds_tau2 ] ) .",
    "however , it has been noted in several works @xcite that while nsi are expected to play a subdominant role on the oscillations of atmospheric and solar neutrinos , there exist degenerate directions in the parameter space where large nsi are still allowed .",
    "future data from short and medium baseline neutrino beams will help to resolve these degeneracies @xcite .",
    "in the early universe , thermally produced neutrinos were in equilibrium with other particles down to temperatures of few mev , when weak interactions became ineffective and neutrino decoupled from the plasma .",
    "as a first approximation , the thermal fermi - dirac momentum spectrum is preserved after the freeze - out of weak interactions , since neutrinos decoupled when ultra - relativistic and both neutrino momenta and temperature redshift identically with the universe expansion .",
    "a neutrino chemical potential @xmath61 would exist in the presence of a neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry , but it was shown in @xcite that the stringent bbn bounds on @xmath62 ( for an updated limit see e.g.  @xcite ) apply to all flavors , since neutrino oscillations lead to flavor equilibrium before bbn .",
    "thus we shall ignore a relic neutrino asymmetry in the following .",
    "it proves useful to define the following dimensionless variables instead of time , momenta and photon temperature @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an arbitrary mass scale which we choose as the electron mass @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the universe scale factor .",

    ", @xmath69 can be identified with the temperature of neutrinos in the limit of instantaneous decoupling . after decoupling , neutrinos",
    "enter cosmological observables mainly via their energy density . since they also remain relativistic for most of the cosmological evolution  down to a temperature of the order of their sub - ev mass scale  it is customary to parameterize their contribution to the radiation energy density @xmath70 in terms of the effective number of neutrinos @xmath0  @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 describes the photon to neutrino temperature ratio in the limit of instantaneous neutrino decoupling .",

    "our results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we have calculated various combinations of the two @xmath24 nsi parameters , that correspond to the points shown in fig.[epsr_epsl ] . for illustrative purposes , we considered the case with extremely large nsi @xmath190 ( already excluded by laboratory bounds ) , where the distortions in the distribution functions of neutrinos lead to a significant change in @xmath0 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     \\(4 ) cases where the flavor - changing nsi parameters @xmath191 are non - zero , that for simplicity we consider real .",
    "we consider both cases with vanishing diagonal nsi and with all possible nsi parameters with the largest allowed values according to eqs .",
    "( [ bounds_barranco ] ) .",
    "the last column ( @xmath192 ) in tables 1 - 4 reports the variation in the mass yield of @xmath1he synthesized during bbn , which predicts typically @xmath193 for the baryon density @xmath194 favoured by cmb anisotropy studies  @xcite .",
    "neutrinos affect the outcome of bbn in a flavor independent way through their contribution to the radiation energy density ( change in @xmath0 ) .",
    "in addition , the role played by electron neutrinos and antineutrinos in the weak reactions that convert neutrons and protons is very important for fixing the primordial production of @xmath1he , which is thus the nucleus mostly sensitive to non - standard physics in the neutrino sector .",
    "to predict quantitatively the change @xmath192 induced by nsi , we take exactly into account the modified thermodinamical quantities , while treating perturbatively the change in the weak rates .",
    "this is justified given the relatively small effects we are considering .",
    "we closely follow the treatment given in  @xcite , to which we refer the reader for further details .",
    "the results are generally in agreement with the approximate ones predicted in sec .",
    "[ sec : decoupling ] ( see in particular fig .  [ eps_neff ] ) , apart for minor differences due to the improved treatment .",
    "also , as one naively expects , large @xmath19 enhance mostly the distortions in the electronic flavor , while large @xmath42 lead to larger distortions in the tau neutrino spectra .",
    "however , the differences between the spectra of the three neutrino flavors are reduced by the partial re - shuffling of the entropy transfer due to the effects of neutrino oscillations .",
    "in general , we find that the presence of non - zero nsi enhances the transfer of entropy from @xmath3 to neutrinos , leading to values up to @xmath2 when all nsi parameters are close to the boundaries of the allowed regions discussed in sec .",
    "[ nsisummary ] , which is almost three times the departure of @xmath0 from @xmath195 that already exists for sm weak interactions ( the first row in table 1 ) .",
    "we also obtained some significant departures of @xmath196 from the standard value , such as @xmath197 for @xmath190 , but only for nsi parameters well beyond the allowed regions . on the other hand , for particular choices of the diagonal nsi parameters that minimize the @xmath198 interaction we find a reduction in the final value of the distortions or @xmath196 with respect to the sm value , as expected from our discussion in sec",
    "[ dect_nsi ] .    finally , we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ nsisummary ] that neutrino - neutrino interactions are poorly constrained . in the case of interactions involving left - handed neutrinos only , they can still be twice as effective as in the sm , as reported in @xcite . since enhanced neutrino - neutrino interactions will redistribute the distortions more efficiently",
    ", they can modify the results described in this section . in order to check this , we doubled the intensity of the contributions of the neutrino - neutrino interactions to the collision integral and repeated the calculations for some of the cases considered above .",
    "we found that the results are basically unchanged , confirming the unimportant role played by neutrino - neutrino collisions in the process of neutrino decoupling .",
    "the process of relic neutrino decoupling in the early universe is sensitive to the strength of the interactions between neutrinos and the plasma formed by electrons and positrons .",
    "if neutrinos were kept in longer thermal contact with them than in the standard case , they would share a larger fraction of the entropy release from @xmath3 annihilations .",
    "this would affect the predicted characteristics of the cosmic background of neutrinos ( c@xmath101b ) , which in turn could modify the late evolution of the universe and the bounds on neutrino properties from the analysis of cosmological observables .    in this paper",
    "we have considered how the decoupling of relic neutrinos is modified in presence of non - standard neutral current neutrino - electron interactions .",
    "first , we have provided a rough estimate of the size of nsi couplings needed to affect in a relevant way the properties of the c@xmath101b and of related observables .",
    "we find that needed couplings are by far larger than the existing laboratory bounds , as also confirmed by a semi - analytical solution of the relevant kinetic equations .",
    "thus , nsi can only play a minor role in shaping the c@xmath101b .",
    "however , nsi might still contribute with comparable or larger distortions in the neutrino spectra than predicted in the sm . in order to quantify these deviations ,",
    "we have performed fully numerical and momentum - dependent calculations of the density - matrix equations relevant for neutrino evolution in the early universe , including the effects of flavor neutrino oscillations .    typically , we find that the enhancement in observables like @xmath85 , which measures the change in the radiation content , or the @xmath1he mass yield in the bbn can be up to three times larger than the ones found in the standard case @xcite , for values of all nsi parameters close to the limits placed by laboratory experiments",
    ". nevertheless , even the variation of up to @xmath199 that we found in the @xmath1he abundance is yet too small ( about one order of magnitude ) when compared to the observational error on @xmath200 , which is unfortunately dominated by systematics , and as such difficult to pin down in the near future . instead",
    ", a value of @xmath201 , which is still possible within the present parameter space for nsi couplings , might even be barely detectable .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the cmb satellite planck will soon provide temperature and polarization data that will probably measure the value of @xmath85 with an uncertainty of order @xmath202 @xcite ( for a previous , more optimistic forecast see @xcite ) , or better when combined with data from a large galaxy redshift survey such as sdss @xcite .",
    "future cmb missions may reach the sensitivity of @xmath203 needed to test the standard scenario @xcite , and might achieve a 2@xmath204 hint for @xmath201 and eventually test the effect of large neutrino - electron nsi .    however , barring some extreme cases , we conclude that the prediction of @xmath105 within a few % is quite robust even when taking into account neutrino - electron nsi of the four - fermion type .",
    "thus , their existence can not modify in a significant way the bounds on neutrino properties from cosmological observables , in particular on their masses , as recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "since it is likely that future experiments may narrow further the allowed range of nsi couplings , their role in a cosmological context will be even smaller , at most a sub - leading correction to the standard prediction of the c@xmath101b properties . turning the argument around , however",
    ", one can conclude that a significant deviation of @xmath85 from 3 may require major revisions of the cosmological model , like the introduction of new relativistic relics and/or of an exotic thermal history , or both ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
