    "<S> [ pdlinevstnh ] is the appearance in the inset of an intermediate region at @xmath104 where upon heating a transition @xmath8 to @xmath14 is reached before the system eventually becomes paramagnetic . </S>",

    "<S> the reason is that at high temperature @xmath21 fluctuations first develop ( as implied by the inset of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> however , upon further cooling the bicollinear minimum with a different symmetry also develops and eventually a crossing occurs with first - order characteristics because one local state can not evolve smoothly into the other .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , in addition to reproducing properly the fete structural / magnetic transitions , the correct behavior for the resistivity anisotropy  @xcite is also observed . in the @xmath21 collinear phase , </S>",
    "<S> fs nesting opens a pseudogap for the @xmath114 orbital  @xcite . because this orbital relates to electronic hopping along the ferromagnetic @xmath47-axis , then the fm resistivity is the largest in pnictides . </S>",

    "<S> the key clues to explain the effect are now clear : ( i ) when an electron hops along the plaquette diagonal in the afm direction it pays an energy @xmath67 , but the hopping along the plaquette diagonal fm direction does not have this penalization ; ( ii ) because fs nesting does not involve wavevectors such as @xmath115 , then pseudogaps are not created due to nesting as in pnictides . then </S>",
    "<S> , in essence , the reversed resistance found here is characteristic of physics of large hund coupling materials  @xcite , such as manganites  @xcite , where it is also known that the afm direction is more resistive than the fm direction .     and </S>",

    "<S> for this reason , we calculated the fs at couplings where the ground state is @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ randfs ]  ( c ) shows the fs in the high temperature @xmath7 state . </S>",
    "<S> it is similar to that of the iron pnictides , thus suggestive of @xmath21 order upon cooling ( the @xmath125 centered features are blurry because of how a shallow pocket is affected by temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , as shown before , because of the sharp first - order transition the @xmath8 state reached at low temperature has a peculiar fs [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ randfs ]  ( d ) ] : while the electron pockets are similar , the squarish @xmath125 hole pocket is different from that of pnictides . </S>",
    "<S> in addition `` shadow bands '' features at @xmath126 develop , as observed in arpes  @xcite , indicative of couplings stronger than for pnictides .    </S>",

    "<S> _ using computational techniques applied to the spin - fermion model including a spin - lattice @xmath8 distortion in the @xmath1 channel , we show that the ( often puzzling ) phenomenology of fete can be well reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> this includes the presence of bicollinear magnetic order and @xmath8 lattice distortions , a strong first - order @xmath7-@xmath8 transition , fermi surfaces at high temperature that naively would favor @xmath21 magnetic order , and last but not least also the low - temperature reversed anisotropic resistances between the afm and fm directions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , all this is achieved with spin - lattice dimensionless couplings substantially less than 1 , and with associated lattice distortions @xmath127 as in fete experiments . </S>",
    "<S> while in pnictides the resistance anisotropy is related to fs nesting and a pseudogap in the @xmath114 orbital  @xcite , here we argue that in chalcogenides the strength of the hund coupling is more important for transport since the reversed anisotropy increases with @xmath67 . to our knowledge </S>",
