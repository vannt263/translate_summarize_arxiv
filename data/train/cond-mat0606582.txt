    "due to three - dimensional confinement on length scales comparable to the de broglie wavelength , the electronic properties of semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) show several similarities with those of atoms , the most significant ones being their discrete energy spectrum and the resulting shell structure.@xcite fine structure due to the exchange interaction ( hund s rule)@xcite and kondo physics @xcite have also been predicted and demonstrated .",
    "qds are therefore regarded as _ artificial atoms_.@xcite these systems have stimulated the investigation of the fundamentals of few body physics in semiconductors , since the number of carriers , electrons or holes , in qds can be controlled very accurately , and almost all relevant parameters influencing their strongly correlated states , such as confinement potential or the coupling with static magnetic fields , can be tailored in the experiments , driving the system between very different regimes .",
    "the analogy between artificial and natural atoms is extended to _ artificial molecules _ ( ams ) by realizing tunnel - coupled devices.@xcite the inter - dot tunnelling introduces a new energy scale which may be comparable to other energy scales , namely the single - particle ( sp ) confinement energy , the carrier - carrier interaction , and the magnetic confinement energy . in ams",
    "it is possible to tune the coupling among qds basically at will , thus exploring different molecular bonding regimes;@xcite this is an intriguing option with respect to natural molecules , since for the latter the inter - nuclear coupling is almost fixed by the balance between nuclear repulsion and the electrostatic attraction mediated by valence electrons .",
    "there is a number of different techniques to fabricate ams .",
    "laterally coupled ams@xcite are obtained by creating an electrostatic confinement in a semiconductor heterostructure , such as a doped heterojunction , by means of the photo - lithographic patterning of metallic gates , deposited on the surface of the heterostructure . another way to realize",
    "ams is by the stransky - krastanov mechanism leading to the formation of self - assembled qds with nm - scale confinement with similar sizes and regular shapes . in a stack of several layers ,",
    "the formation of qds in the top layer , coupled through tunneling with the ones in the underlying layer , has been recently demonstrated.@xcite    in the following we shall investigate electronic properties of vertically coupled ams realized starting from a triple barrier heterostructure to form a mesa pillar , possibly using a combination of dry and wet etching.@xcite typically , the effective diameter for electron conduction is smaller than the geometrical diameter of the top contact .",
    "for example , with a top contact @xmath0 0.5 @xmath1 m diameter , it is estimated that the dot diameter is @xmath0 0.1 @xmath1 m when the dot contains a few electrons . still , in this class of devices",
    "the depletion potential in the lateral direction realizes a much softer potential than in the growth ( vertical ) direction , where electrostatic confinement is induced by the band mismatch of the layers in the heterostructure . in this vertical geometry transport",
    "occurs perpendicularly to the plane of the dots , in response to an applied voltage between source and drain contacts .",
    "the strength of the coupling can be modulated by the width of the barrier separating the qds .",
    "in addition , a circular schottky gate is typically placed around the body of the pillar to control the charging of the qds .    in ams , as well as in single qds",
    ", electronic states can be manipulated by a _",
    "vertical _ magnetic field @xmath2 , perpendicular to the plane of the qds ( parallel to the growth direction ) , which drives the system from a low - correlation ( low - field ) regime to a strongly correlated ( high - field ) regime by varying the sp splittings.@xcite recently , non trivial transitions between different quantum states induced by @xmath2 and/or by varying the inter - dot barrier width @xmath3 have been predicted and demonstrated in ams with different coupling regimes.@xcite    while this vertical field configuration has been widely studied both theoretically and experimentally,@xcite few works have been devoted to the _ in - plane _",
    "field configuration,@xcite which is more complicated to simulate and less intuitive , principally because of the lack of the cylindrical symmetry and of analytical solutions for the sp states . furthermore , since in this configuration angular momentum is not a good quantum number , the computational effort increases very rapidly with the electron number ( see sec .",
    "ii b ) .    on the other hand , in vertically coupled qds an in - plane magnetic field @xmath4 modulates the tunneling energy , and one may hope to induce transitions between few - particle states , reminiscent of those that one can obtain by varying the tunneling energy via the barrier potential.@xcite in this way , different coupling regimes would be investigated within just one sample , which is of course an advantage , since it is almost impossible to growth samples completely identical except for the barrier width .",
    "it should be stressed that when the tunneling is modulated by an in - plane magnetic field in vertically coupled qds , the other energy scales , in particular the coulomb interaction , are only weakly affected by the field . due to its importance to the qd - based implementation of quantum - information processing,@xcite",
    "such field configuration has been already investigated in the two - electron case,@xcite whereas less attention has been devoted to the case where more than two carriers are present , in particular when @xmath5 has both an in - plane and a perpendicular component , which is relevant for the transport spectroscopy of such samples . in this case",
    "we expect an interesting physics : in fact both in - plane ( due to @xmath2 ) and vertical ( due to @xmath4 ) correlations are involved in the transitions between quantum states .",
    "in this paper we theoretically investigate the stability of field - induced quantum states of few electrons in ams .",
    "the main focus is on correlation effects , largely enhanced by the field , which determine different mechanisms ( which may interfere between each other ) driving the transition between different ground states , depending on the field direction and inter - dot coupling . in our analysis",
    "we consider three realistic samples with different inter - dot barrier , with the aim of investigating the phenomenology occurring between the two opposite limits of strong coupling and molecular dissociation .",
    "our numerical approach is based on a real - space description of sp states , which takes into account the complexity of real samples . because of the competition between kinetic energy , coulomb interaction , and zeeman energy , it is often necessary to treat exactly ( in contrast , e.g , to mean - field methods ) the few - body hamiltonian of this kind of samples .",
    "our method of choice to include carrier - carrier coulomb interaction is the full configuration interaction ( fci ) approach,@xcite which proved to be accurate and reliable,@xcite although limited to few electrons . in order to stress correlation effects ,",
    "we contrast our numerical results with sp and hartree - fock predictions of the stable quantum phases .",

    "only in - plane degrees of freedom play a role in the @xmath2-induced transition .",
    "the `` hartree '' energy gain @xmath128 compensates the cost in term of sp energy due to the @xmath129 orbital promotion .",
    "moreover , the exchange interaction energy gain , given by the exchange integral @xmath130 , favors the `` ferromagnetic '' triplet configuration ( @xmath103 ) with respect to the `` antiferromagnetic '' singlet , when the two electrons sit on the @xmath121 and @xmath122 orbitals , respectively .",
    "therefore , the electrostatic energy of the triplet configuration @xmath131 is further reduced with respect to the singlet one , @xmath132 .    in the in - plane configuration , instead ,",
    "the tunneling energy separating the lowest - energy @xmath123 and @xmath125 orbitals is very effectively reduced by @xmath4 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",

    "the former made of a doubly occupied @xmath123 orbital and the latter of two parallel - spin electrons sitting on the @xmath123 and @xmath125 orbitals , respectively , tend to the same orbital energy .",
    "however , the small exchange interaction @xmath133 and the zeeman term of the @xmath103 state , both included in the ssd calculation , weakly favor the triplet when the tunneling energy is reduced , above a critical value of @xmath4 .",
    "although the ssd scheme is able to describe , on a qualitative level , the singlet / triplet stability regions , neglecting correlation effects in the ssd scheme strongly underestimates the stability region of the singlet state , favoring the polarized phase : in fact , the description of the singlet state in terms of two electrons sitting on a @xmath123 orbital is poor especially at high field , where an increasing contribution from the @xmath125 orbital gives rise to a spatial correlation along the growth direction , i.e. , with the two electrons sitting on opposite qds , as we have shown in a previous work.@xcite the vertical correlation lowers the energy of the singlet state , making it stable in a larger @xmath4-region , although the zeeman coupling favors the triplet configuration .",
    "indeed , the stability of the singlet state in fci may be interpreted as resulting from a `` superexchange '' effect.@xcite the fci singlet configuration can be better understood after a unitary transformation of the orbital basis to states localized on either one or the other dot . by schematizing the am as a two - site lattice at half filling , the appropriate conceptual framework , when the qds are weakly coupled , is that of the hubbard model,@xcite where the system has a tendency to `` antiferromagnetism '' , since two electrons in a singlet state can lower their energy by virtually hopping from one to the other dot , while the same process is prohibited for a triplet state by pauli blocking .",
    "when tunneling energy does not pay off for antiparallel alignment , the triplet phase becomes favorable .",
    "on the other hand , a ssd scheme would neglect also the correlation regarding the triplet state when both @xmath2 and @xmath4 are present , namely the central region in the diagrams of fig .",
