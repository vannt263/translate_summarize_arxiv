    "the kuiper belt is a long - lived region of the solar system just beyond neptune where the planetisimals have not coalesced into a planet .",
    "it contains about 80,000 objects with radii greater than 50 km ( trujillo , jewitt & luu 2001 ) which have been collisionally processed and gravitationally perturbed throughout the age of the solar system .",
    "the short - period comets and centaurs are believed to originate from the kuiper belt ( fernandez 1980 ; duncan , quinn & tremaine 1988 ) .    physically , the kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) show a large diversity of colors from slightly blue to ultra red ( @xmath8 to @xmath9 , luu and jewitt 1996 ) and may show correlations between colors , inclination and/or perihelion distance ( jewitt & luu 2001 ; trujillo & brown 2002 ; doressoundiram et al . 2002 ; tegler & romanishin 2003 ) .",
    "spectra of kbos are mostly featureless with a few showing hints of water ice ( brown , cruikshank & pendleton 1999 ; jewitt & luu 2001 ; lazzarin et al .",
    "the range of kbo geometric albedos is still poorly sampled but the larger ones likely have values between 0.04 to 0.10 ( jewitt , aussel & evans 2001 ; altenhoff , bertoldi & menten 2004 ) .",
    "time - resolved observations of kbos show that @xmath10 vary by @xmath11 magnitudes , @xmath12 by @xmath13 magnitudes and @xmath14 by @xmath15 magnitudes ( sheppard & jewitt 2002 ; ortiz et al .",
    "2003 ; lacerda & luu 2003 ; sheppard & jewitt 2004 ) .",
    "one object , ( 20000 ) varuna , displays a large photometric range and fast rotation which is best interpreted as a structurally weak object elongated by its own rotational angular momentum ( jewitt & sheppard 2002 ) .",
    "a significant fraction of kbos appear to be more elongated than main - belt asteroids of similar size ( sheppard & jewitt 2002 ) .",
    "the kbo phase functions are steep , with a median of @xmath16 magnitudes per degree between phase angles of 0 and 2 degrees ( sheppard & jewitt 2002 ; schaefer & rabinowitz 2002 ; sheppard & jewitt 2004 ) .    about @xmath17 of the kbos are binaries with separations @xmath18 ( noll et al .",
    "2002 ) while binaries with separations @xmath19 may constitute about @xmath20 of the population ( trujillo 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "all the binary kbos found to date appear to have mass ratios near unity , though this may be an observational selection effect .",
    "the mechanism responsible for creating kbo binaries is not clear .",
    "formation through collisions is unlikely ( stern 2002 ) . weidenschilling ( 2002 )",
    "has proposed formation of such binaries through complex three - body interactions which would only occur efficiently in a much higher population of large kbos than can currently be accounted for .",
    "goldreich , lithwick & sari ( 2002 ) have proposed that kbo binaries could have formed when two bodies approach each other and energy is extracted either by dynamical friction from the surrounding sea of smaller kbos or by a close third body .",
    "this process also requires that the density of kbos was @xmath21 to @xmath22 times greater than now .",
    "they predict that closer binaries should be more abundant in the kuiper belt while weidenschilling s mechanism predicts the opposite .",
    "the present paper is the fourth in a series resulting from the hawaii kuiper belt variability project ( hkbvp , see jewitt & sheppard 2002 ; sheppard & jewitt 2002 ; sheppard & jewitt 2004 )",
    ". the practical aim of the project is to determine the rotational characteristics ( principally period and shape ) of bright kbos ( @xmath23 ) in order to learn about the distributions of rotation period and shape in these objects . in the course of this survey we found that 2001 qg@xmath0 had an extremely large light variation and a relatively long period .",
    "we have obtained optical observations of 2001 qg@xmath0 in order to accurately determine the rotational lightcurve and constrain its possible causes .",
    "2001 qg@xmath0 has a typical plutino orbit in 3:2 mean - motion resonance with neptune , semi - major axis at 39.2 au , eccentricity of 0.19 and inclination of 6.5 degrees .",
    "we used the university of hawaii ( uh ) 2.2 m diameter telescope atop mauna kea in hawaii to obtain r - band observations of 2001 qg@xmath0 on three separate observing runs each covering several nights : ut september 12 and 13 2002 ; august 22 , 26 , 27 and 28 2003 ; september 27 , 28 and 30 2003 .",
    "two different ccd cameras were employed . for the september 2002 and september 2003 observations we used a @xmath24 pixel tektronix ccd ( @xmath25 @xmath26 pixels ) camera with a @xmath27 pixel@xmath28 scale at the f/10 cassegrain focus .",
    "an antireflection coating on the ccd gave very high average quantum efficiency ( 0.90 ) in the r - band .",
    "the field - of - view was @xmath29 .",
    "for the august 2003 observations we used the orthogonal parallel transfer imaging camera ( optic ) .",
    "optic has two @xmath30 pixel lincoln lab ccid28 orthogonal transfer ccds developed to compensate for real - time image motion by moving the charge on the chips to compensate for seeing variations ( tonry , burke & schechter 1997 ) .",
    "howell et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have demonstrated that these chips are photometrically accurate and provide routine sharpening of the image point spread function .",
    "there is a @xmath31 gap between the chips .",
    "the total field - of - view was @xmath32 with @xmath33 @xmath26 pixels which corresponds to @xmath34 pixel@xmath28 scale at the f/10 cassegrain focus .",
    "the same r - band filter based on the johnson - kron - cousins photometric system was used for all uh 2.2 m observations .",
    "in addition we used the keck i 10 m telescope to obtain bvr colors of 2001 qg298 at its maximum and minimum light on ut august 30 , 2003 .",
    "the lris camera with its tektronix @xmath35 pixel ccd and @xmath25 @xmath26 pixels ( image scale @xmath36 pixel@xmath28 ) was used ( oke et al . 1995 ) with the facility broadband bvr filter set . due to a technical problem with the blue camera side we used only the red side for photometry at bv and r. the blue filter response",
    "was cut by the use of a dichroic at 0.460 @xmath26 .",
    "all exposures were taken in a consistent manner with the telescope autoguided on bright nearby stars . the seeing ranged from @xmath37 to @xmath38 during the various observations .",
    "2001 qg@xmath0 moved relative to the fixed stars at a maximum of @xmath39 hr@xmath28 corresponding to trail lengths @xmath40 @xmath41 in the longest ( 450 sec ) exposures .",
    "thus motion of the object was insignificant compared to the seeing .",
    "images from the uh telescope were bias - subtracted and then flat - fielded using the median of a set of dithered images of the twilight sky .",
    "data from keck were bias subtracted and flattened using flat fields obtained from an illuminated spot inside the closed dome .",
    "landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars were employed for the absolute photometric calibration . to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio we performed aperture correction photometry by using a small aperture on 2001 qg@xmath0 ( @xmath42 to @xmath43 in radius ) and both the same small aperture and a large aperture ( @xmath44 to @xmath45 in radius ) on ( four or more ) nearby bright field stars .",
    "we corrected the magnitude within the small aperture used for the kbos by determining the correction from the small to the large aperture using the field stars ( c.f .",
    "tegler and romanishin 2000 ; jewitt & luu 2001 ; sheppard & jewitt 2002 ) .",
    "since 2001 qg@xmath0 moved slowly we were able to use the same field stars from night to night within each observing run , resulting in very stable relative photometric calibration from night to night .",
    "the observational geometry for 2001 qg@xmath0 on each night of observation is shown in table  1 .",
    "tables  2 and 3 show the photometric results for 2001 qg@xmath0 .",
    "we used the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) method ( stellingwerf 1978 ) to search for periodicity in the data . in pdm ,",
    "the metric is the so - called @xmath46 parameter , which is essentially the variance of the unphased data divided by the variance of the data when phased by a given period .",
    "the best - fit period should have a very small dispersion compared to the unphased data and thus @xmath47 1 indicates that a good fit has been found .",
    "2001 qg@xmath0 showed substantial variability ( @xmath48 magnitudes with a single - peaked period near @xmath49 hr ) in r - band observations from two nights in september 2002 .",
    "we obtained further observations of the object in 2003 to determine the lightcurve with greater accuracy .",
    "pdm analysis of all the apparent magnitude r - band data from the september 2002 and august and september 2003 observations shows that 2001 qg@xmath0 has strong @xmath46 minima near the periods @xmath50 hr and @xmath51 hr , with weaker alias periods flanking these ( figure  [ fig : pdmqg ] ) .",
    "we corrected the apparent magnitude data for the minor phase angle effects ( we used the nominal 0.16 magnitudes per degree found in sheppard & jewitt 2003 ) and light travel - time differences of the observations to correspond to the august 30 , 2003 observations .",
    "we then phased the data to all the peaks with @xmath52 and found only the 6.8872 and 13.7744 hour periods to be consistent with all the data ( figures  [ fig : phaseqgsingle ] and [ fig : phaseqgdouble ] ) . through a closer look at the pdm plot ( figure  [ fig : pdmqgsmall ] ) and phasing the data we find best fit periods @xmath53 hr ( a lightcurve with a single maximum per period ) and @xmath54 hr ( two maxima per period as expected for rotational modulation caused by an aspherical shape )",
    "the double - peaked lightcurve appears to be the best fit with the minima different by about 0.1 magnitudes while the maxima appear to be of similar brightness .",
    "the photometric range of the lightcurve is @xmath55 magnitudes .",
    "the keck bvr colors of 2001 qg@xmath0 show no variation from minimum to maximum light within the photometric uncertainties of a few % ( see figures  [ fig : phaseqgsingle ] and [ fig : phaseqgdouble ] ) .",
    "this is again consistent with a lightcurve that is produced by an elongated shape , rather than by albedo variations .",
    "the colors ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) show that 2001 qg@xmath0 is red and similar to the mean values ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , 28 objects ) for kbos as a group ( jewitt and luu 2001 ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude of a solar system object , @xmath60 , is the hypothetical magnitude the object would have if it where at heliocentric ( @xmath61 ) and geocentric ( @xmath62 ) distances of 1 au and had a phase angle ( @xmath63 ) of 0 degrees .",
    "we use the relation @xmath64 to find the absolute magnitude by correcting for the geometrical and phase angle effects in the 2001 qg@xmath0 observations . here",
    "@xmath65 is the apparent red magnitude of the object and @xmath66 is the phase function . using the nominal value of @xmath67 magnitudes per degree for kbos at low phase angles ( sheppard & jewitt 2002 ; sheppard & jewitt 2004 ) and data from table  1 we find that 2001 qg@xmath0 has @xmath68 at maximum light and @xmath69 magnitudes at minimum light .",
    "if attributed to a rotational variation of the cross - section , this corresponds to a ratio of maximum to minimum areas of 2.85:1 .",
    "the effective radius of an object can be calculated using the relation @xmath70 $ ] where @xmath71 is the apparent red magnitude of the sun ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 is the red geometric albedo and @xmath74 ( km ) is the effective circular radius of the object . if we assume an albedo of 0.04 ( 0.10 ) this corresponds to effective circular radii at maximum and minimum light of about 158 ( 100 ) km and 94 ( 59 ) km , respectively . at the mean absolute magnitude of 6.85 mag , the effective circular radius is 122 ( 77 ) km .",
    "only three other objects in the solar system larger than 25 km in radius are known to have lightcurve ranges @xmath75 magnitude ( table  4 ) . following jewitt and sheppard ( 2002 )",
    "we discuss three possible models of rotational variation to try to compare the objects from table  4 with 2001 qg@xmath0 .      on asteroids ,",
    "albedo variations contribute brightness variations that are usually less than about @xmath76 ( degewij , tedesco & zellner 1979 ) .",
    "rotationally correlated color variations may be seen if the albedo variations are large since materials with markedly different albedos may differ compositionally . as seen in table  4",
    ", saturn s satellite iapetus is the only object in which variations @xmath771 mag .",
    "are explained through albedo .",
    "the large albedo contrast on iapetus is likely a special consequence of its synchronous rotation and the anisotropic impact of material trapped in orbit about saturn onto its leading hemisphere ( cook & franklin 1970 ) .",
    "iapetus shows clear rotational color variations ( @xmath78 0.1 mag . )",
    "that are correlated with the rotational albedo variations ( millis 1977 ) and which would be detected in 2001 qg@xmath0 given the quality of our data .",
    "the special circumstance of iapetus is without obvious analogy in the kuiper belt and we do not believe that it is a good model for the extreme lightcurve of 2001 qg@xmath0 .",
    "pluto shows a much smaller variation ( about 0.3 magnitudes ) thought to be caused by albedo structure ( buie , tholen & wasserman 1997 ) .",
    "pluto is so large that it can sustain an atmosphere which may contribute to amplifying its lightcurve range by allowing surface frosts to condense on brighter ( cooler ) spots .",
    "thus brighter spots grow brighter while darker ( hotter ) spots grow darker through the sublimation of ices .",
    "this positive feedback mechanism requires an atmosphere and is unlikely to be relevant on a kbo as small as 2001 qg@xmath0",
    ".    while we can not absolutely exclude surface markings as the dominant cause of 2001 qg@xmath0 s large rotational brightness variation , we are highly skeptical of this explanation .",
    "we measure no color variation with rotation , there appear to be two distinct minima and the range is so large as to be beyond reasonable explanation from albedo alone .",
    "since surface markings are most likely not the cause of the lightcurve , the observed photometric variations are probably caused by changes in the projected cross - section of an elongated body in rotation about its minor axis .",
    "the rotation period of an elongated object should be twice the single - peaked lightcurve period because of the projection of both long axes ( 2 maxima ) and short axes ( 2 minima ) during one full rotation .",
    "if the body is elongated , we can use the ratio of maximum to minimum brightness to determine the projection of the body shape into the plane of the sky .",
    "the rotational brightness range of a triaxial object with semiaxes @xmath79 in rotation about the @xmath80 axis and viewed equatorially is    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is expressed in magnitudes .",
    "this gives a lower limit to @xmath83 because of the effects of projection .",
    "using @xmath84 for 2001 qg@xmath0 , we find the lower limit is @xmath85 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath86 and @xmath87 km for the geometric albedo 0.04 case and @xmath88 and @xmath89 km for an albedo of 0.10 .",
    "it is possible that 2001 qg@xmath0 is elongated and able to resist gravitational compression into a spherical shape by virtue of its intrinsic compressive strength .",
    "however , observations of asteroids in the main - belt suggest that only the smallest ( @xmath70.1 km sized ) asteroids are in possession of a tensile strength sufficient to resist rotational deformation ( pravec , harris & michalowski 2003 ) .",
    "observations of both asteroids and planetary satellites suggest that many objects with radii @xmath77 50 to 75 km have shapes controlled by self - gravity , not by material strength ( farinella 1987 ; farinella & zappala 1997 ) .",
    "the widely accepted explanation is that these bodies are internally weak because they have been fractured by numerous past impacts .",
    "this explanation is also plausible in the kuiper belt , where models attest to a harsh collisional environment at early times ( e.g. davis & farinella 1997 ) .",
    "we feel that the extraordinarily large amplitude of 2001 qg@xmath0 is unlikely to be caused by elongation of the object sustained by its own material strength , although we can not rule out this possibility .",
    "structurally weak bodies are susceptible to rotational deformation .",
    "the 1000-km scale kbo ( 20000 ) varuna ( rotation period 6.3442 @xmath90 0.0002",
    "hr and lightcurve range 0.42 @xmath90 0.02 mag ) is the best current example in the kuiper belt ( jewitt and sheppard 2002 ) . in the main asteroid belt ,",
    "216 kleopatra has a very short period ( 5.385 hr ) and large lightcurve range ( 1.18 mag .",
    ", corresponding to axis ratio @xmath72.95:1 and dimensions @xmath7 217 @xmath91 94 km , table  4 ) .",
    "kleopatra has been observed to be a highly elongated body through radar and high resolution imaging and the most likely explanation is that 216 kleopatra is rotationally deformed ( leone et al .",
    "1984 ; ostro et al . 2000 ; hestroffer et al .",
    "2002 ; washabaugh & scheeres 2002 ) .",
    "is rotational elongation a viable model for 2001 qg@xmath0 ?    the critical rotation period ( @xmath92 )",
    "at which centripetal acceleration equals gravitational acceleration towards the center of a rotating spherical object is    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is the gravitational constant and @xmath95 is the density of the object . with @xmath95",
    "= @xmath96 kg m@xmath97 the critical period is about 3.3 hr . even at longer periods",
    ", real bodies will suffer centripetal deformation into triaxial aspherical shapes which depend on their density , angular momentum and material strength .",
    "the limiting equilibrium shapes of rotating strengthless fluid bodies have been well studied by chandrasekhar ( 1987 ) and a detailed discussion in the context of the kbos can be found in jewitt and sheppard ( 2002 ) .",
    "we briefly mention here that triaxial `` jacobi '' ellipsoids with large angular momenta are rotationally elongated and generate lightcurves with substantial ranges when viewed equatorially .",
    "leone et al . (",
    "1984 ) have analyzed rotational equilibrium configurations of strengthless asteroids in detail ( see figure  [ fig : kboperamp ] ) .",
    "they show that the maximum photometric range of a rotational ellipsoid is 0.9 mag : more elongated objects are unstable to rotational fission .",
    "the 1.14 mag photometric range of 2001 qg@xmath0 exceeds this limit .",
    "in addition , the 13.7744 hr ( two - peaked ) rotation period is much too long to cause significant elongation for any plausible bulk density ( figure  [ fig : kboperamp ] ) . for these reasons we do not believe that 2001 qg@xmath0 is a single rotationally distorted object .",
    "a third possible explanation for the extreme lightcurve of 2001 qg@xmath0 is that this is an eclipsing binary .",
    "a wide separation ( sum of the orbital semi - major axes much larger than the sum of the component radii ) is unlikely because such a system would generate a distinctive `` notched '' lightcurve that is unlike the lightcurve of 2001 qg@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , a wide separation would require unreasonably high bulk density of the components in order to generate the measured rotational period .",
    "if 2001 qg@xmath0 is a binary then the components must be close or in contact .",
    "we next consider the limiting case of a contact binary .",
    "the axis ratio of a contact binary consisting of equal spheres is @xmath98 , corresponding to a lightcurve range @xmath82 = 0.75 magnitudes , as seen from the rotational equator . at the average viewing angle",
    "@xmath99 degrees we would expect @xmath82 = 0.45 mag .",
    "the rotational variation of 2001 qg@xmath0 is too large to be explained as a contact binary consisting of two equal spheres .",
    "however , close binary components of low strength should be elongated by mutual tidal forces , giving a larger lightcurve range than possible in the case of equal spheres ( leone et al . 1984 ) .",
    "the latter authors find that the maximum range for a tidally distorted nearly contact binary is 1.2 magnitudes , compatible with the 1.14 mag .",
    "range of 2001 qg@xmath0 ( figure  [ fig : kboperamp ] ) .",
    "the contact binary hypothesis is the likely explanation of 624 hektor s lightcurve ( hartmann & cruikshank 1978 ; weidenschilling 1980 ; leone et al . 1984 ) and could also explain 216 kleopatra s lightcurve ( leone et al .",
    "1984 ; ostro et al .",
    "2000 ; hestroffer et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we suggest that the relatively long double - peaked period ( @xmath100 hr ) and large photometric range ( @xmath101 magnitudes ) of 2001 qg@xmath0 s lightcurve are best understood if the body is a contact binary or nearly contact binary viewed from an approximately equatorial perspective .",
    "the large range suggests that the components are of similar size and are distorted by their mutual tidal interactions . using the calculations from leone et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , who take into account the mutual deformation of close , strengthless binary components , we find the density of these objects must be @xmath71000 kg m@xmath97 in order to remain bound in a binary system separated by the roche radius ( which is just over twice the component radius ) .",
    "if we assume that the albedo of both objects is 0.04 , the effective radius of each component is about 95 km as found above .",
    "using this information we find from kepler s third law that if the components are separated , they would be about 300 km apart .",
    "this separation as seen on the sky ( @xmath102 ) is small enough to have escaped resolution with current technology .",
    "further , we point out that the maximum of the lightcurve of 2001 qg@xmath0 is more nearly `` u '' shaped ( or flattened ) than is the `` v '' shaped minimum ( figure  [ fig : phaseqgdouble ] ) .",
    "this is also true for 624 hektor ( dunlap & gehrels 1969 ) and may be a distinguishing , though not unique , signature of a contact or nearly contact binary ( zappala 1984 ; leone et al .",
    "1984 ; cellino et al .",
    "1985 ) . in comparison ,",
    "( 20000 ) varuna , which is probably not a contact binary ( see below and jewitt & sheppard 2002 ) , does not show significant differences in the curvature of the lightcurve maxima and minima .    in short , while we can not prove that 2001 qg@xmath0 is a contact binary , we find by elimination of other possibilities that this is the most convincing explanation of its lightcurve .",
    "the distribution of measured lightcurve properties is shown in figure  [ fig : kboperamp ] ( adapted from figure  4 of leone et al .",
    "( 1984 ) ) . there ,",
    "region a corresponds to the low rotational range objects ( of any period ) in which the variability can be plausibly associated with surface albedo markings .",
    "region b corresponds to the rotationally deformed jacobi ellipsoids while region c marks the domain of the close binary objects .",
    "plotted in the figure are the lightcurve periods and ranges for kbos from the hkbvp ( jewitt & sheppard 2002 ; sheppard & jewitt 2002 ; sheppard & jewitt 2004 )",
    ". we also show large main belt asteroids ( data from http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/lightcurvedat.html updated by a. harris and b. warner and based on lagerkvist , harris & zappala 1989 ) .",
    "once again we note that the measured kbo ranges should , in most cases , be regarded as lower limits to the range because of the possible effects of projection into the plane of the sky .    of the 34 kbos in our sample ,",
    "five fall into region c in figure  [ fig : kboperamp ] . of these , 2001 qg@xmath0 is by far the best candidate for being a contact or nearly contact binary system since it alone has a range between the @xmath103 0.9 mag .",
    "limit for a single rotational equilibrium ellipsoid and the @xmath1041.2 mag .",
    "limit for a mutually distorted close binary ( table  5 ) .",
    "it is also rotating too slowly to be substantially distorted by its own spin ( figure  [ fig : kboperamp ] ) . both ( 33128 ) 1998 bu@xmath105 and 2000",
    "gn@xmath106 are good candidates which have large photometric ranges and relatively slow periods .",
    "kbos ( 26308 ) 1998 sm@xmath107 and ( 32929 ) 1995 qy@xmath108 could be rotationally deformed ellipsoids , but their relatively slow rotations would require densities much smaller than that of water , a prospect which we consider unlikely .",
    "we next ask what might be the abundance of contact or close binaries in the kuiper belt . as a first estimate we assume that we have detected one such object ( 2001 qg@xmath0 ) in a sample of 34 kbos observed with adequate time resolution .",
    "the answer depends on the magnitude of the correction for projection effects caused by the orientation of the rotation vector with respect to the line of sight .",
    "this correction is intrinsically uncertain , since it depends on unknowns such as the scattering function of the surface materials of the kbo as well as on the detailed shape .",
    "we adopt two crude approximations that should give the projection correction at least to within a factor of a few .",
    "first , we represent the elongated shape of the kbo by a rectangular block with dimensions a @xmath3 b = c. the lightcurve range varies with angle from the equator , @xmath109 , in this approximation as    @xmath110.\\ ] ]    for the limiting case of a highly distorted contact binary with @xmath82 = 1.2 mag . at @xmath109",

    "given the crudity of the model , the agreement between projection factors from eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is encouraging .",
    "together , the data and the projection factors suggest that in our sample of 34 kbos , perhaps 3 to 6 objects are as elongated as 2001 qg@xmath0 but only 2001 qg@xmath0 is viewed from a sufficiently equatorial perspective that the lightcurve is distinct .",
    "this is consistent with figure 5 , which shows that @xmath120 of @xmath121 kbos ( @xmath122 ) from the hkbvp occupy region c of the period - range diagram .",
    "our estimate is very crude and is also a lower limit to the true binary fraction because close binaries with components of unequal size will not satisfy the 0.9 @xmath115 1.2 mag .",
    "criterion for detection .",
    "the key point is that the data are consistent with a substantial close binary fraction in the kuiper belt .",
    "figure  [ fig : kboperamp ] also shows that there are no large main - belt asteroids ( radii @xmath123 km ) in region c , which is where similar sized component contact binaries are expected to be . to date , no examples of large binary main - belt asteroids with similar sized components have been found , even though the main belt has been extensively searched for binarity ( see margot 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the main - belt asteroids may have had a collisional history significantly different from that of the kbos .",
    "the contact binary interpretation of the 2001 qg@xmath0 lightcurve is clearly non - unique . indeed ,",
    "firm proof of the existence of contact binaries will be as difficult to establish in the kuiper belt as it has been in closer , brighter populations of small bodies .",
    "nevertheless , the data are compatible with a high abundance of such objects .",
    "it is interesting to speculate about how such objects could form in abundance .",
    "one model of the formation and long term evolution of wide binaries predicts that such objects could be driven together by dynamical friction or three - body interactions ( goldreich et al .",
    "2002 ) . objects like 2001 qg@xmath0 would be naturally produced by such a mechanism .",
    "kuiper belt object 2001 qg@xmath0 has the most extreme lightcurve of any of the 34 objects so far observed in the hawaii kuiper belt variability project .",
    "the double - peaked lightcurve period is @xmath6 hr and peak - to - peak range is @xmath124 mag .",
    "only two other minor planets with radii @xmath77 25 km ( 624 hektor and 216 kleopatra ) and one planetary satellite ( iapetus ) are known to show rotational photometric variation greater than 1 mag .",
    "the absolute red magnitude is @xmath125(1,1,0 ) = 6.28 at maximum light and 7.42 mag . at minimum light . with an assumed geometric albedo of 0.04 ( 0.10 ) we derive effective circular radii at maximum and minimum light of 158 ( 100 ) and 94 ( 59 ) km , respectively .",
    "no variation in the bvr colors between maximum and minimum light was detected to within photometric uncertainties of a few percent .",
    "\\4 . the large photometric range",
    ", differences in the lightcurve minima , and long period of 2001 qg@xmath0 are consistent with and strongly suggest that this object is a contact or nearly contact binary , viewed equatorially .",
    "if 2001 qg@xmath0 is a contact binary with similarly sized components , then we conclude that such objects constitute at least 10% to 20% of the kuiper belt population at large sizes .",
