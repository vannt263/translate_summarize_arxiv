    "in this year s _ review of particle physics _ @xcite ,",
    "resonances are defined by poles of the s - matrix , whether in scattering , production , or decay matrix elements .",
    "positions of the s - matrix poles are , as stated there , independent of the process .",
    "therefore , the poles are the fundamental physical properties of the s - matrix . as such , they are in contrast to other quantities related to resonance phenomena like breit - wigner parameters or k - matrix poles .    in the same reference",
    "two strong statements are made that succinctly summarize the current understanding of the physical properties of resonances .",
    "the first is that the breit - wigner parameters depend on the formalism used ( angular - momentum barrier factors , cut - off parameters , and the assumed or modeled background ) .",
    "the other is that the accurate determination of pole parameters from the analysis of data on the real energy axis requires the implementation of the correct analytic structure of the relevant ( often coupled ) channels .    in this letter",
    "we show that neither of the statements is entirely correct .",
    "we propose a simple few - parameter model to extract pole parameters directly from the data , without details on the analytic structure of the s - matrix , and extract the breit - wigner parameters independently of any formalism and knowledge of the barrier factors , cut - off parameters or background .",
    "in addition , we show that the breit - wigner parameters are , along with the pole parameters , the key properties of the s - matrix .",
    "this result is especially important because _ ab initio _ hadronic models , such as the lattice quantum chromodynamics @xcite and various quark models ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , often use breit - wigner parameters . if those parameters were formalism dependent , the predictions would be unreliable .",
    "some results in the literature strongly suggest that the breit - wigner parameters are fundamentally flawed . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors show that the breit - wigner parameters of @xmath1 change under a particular field transformation which leaves other physical properties , including the poles of the s - matrix , invariant . moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite a similar feature is shown for the breit - wigner parameters of the z boson .    here",
    "we show that the definition of the breit - wigner parameters used in refs .",
    "@xcite was not appropriate and that the conclusion on non - physicality of those parameters is not valid .",
    "unfortunately , that was not the last of the problems with breit - wigner parameters .",
    "there is a lot of confusion in the literature regarding the breit - wigner mass .",
    "sometimes it is mistaken by the bare mass as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see ref .",
    "sometimes it is used in models where the pole mass should be used instead as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( cf .  the original model in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . and",
    "sometimes resonant peak positions are confused for the pole positions as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite . that last paper led us to look into the connection of the peaks with pole and breit - wigner parameters . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that the resonant peak positions are often much closer to the breit - wigner than to the pole masses but , generally , they are neither .    here",
    "we explain the interrelation between these three resonant features and show that there is a surprisingly simple relation between its breit - wigner mass , pole position , and the peak position .    however , the biggest surprise with the proposed model is related to the k - matrix . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have analyzed a well - known unitary analytic coupled - channel approach @xcite and noted that the extracted k - matrix poles are almost always similar to the breit - wigner masses .",
    "moreover , each pole was at the same energy as the peak of the imaginary part and the zero of the real part of the amplitude - matrix trace .",
    "interestingly enough , when we calculate the k - matrix using the unitarized version of the first - order non - analytic model introduced in this letter , we obtain exactly the same features as we saw in ref .",
    "the breit - wigner mass is indeed the k - matrix pole .",
    "since the k - matrix is uniquely defined by the s - matrix , the breit - wigner mass is a fundamental property of the s - matrix .",
    "in case that particle spins are not measured , the formula for the resonant cross section is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is c.m .  momentum of incident particles , @xmath4 is the spin of the resonance , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the spins of incident particles , and @xmath7 is a contribution of background processes . the key object in this relation is a resonant amplitude @xmath8 , generally written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is c.m .",
    "energy , the vertex function @xmath11 is a real , and the self energy @xmath12 is a complex function of energy @xmath10 .",
    "we get the familiar * breit - wigner formula * @xcite by assuming that both @xmath11 and @xmath12 are real - valued and do not change much with energy @xmath13 here we use the standard terminology in this field : @xmath14 is the partial decay width , i.e. , the inverse of the resonance mean lifetime that gives the rate at which a resonance decays into the observed channel . in natural units , it has the same unit as the mass @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the total decay width , i.e. , the sum of all partial decay widths .",
    "this form is not suitable for broad resonances nor resonances with substantially deformed shape .",
    "it should be pointed out that , in spite of this formula s name , the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are generally not the breit - wigner parameters .",
    "the * breit - wigner parameters * are usually obtained from a more realistic flatt formula @xcite , where both @xmath11 and @xmath12 are assumed to be real functions with particular properties .",
    "these properties may vary and this is the reason why the extracted breit - wigner parameters often differ from one analysis to another , even if the same dataset is analyzed .",
    "such a formula was used in ref .",
    "@xcite and produced a wrong result because in the analyzed energy region @xmath12 was complex .",
    "contrary to the aforementioned approaches , in our model we acknowledge the fact that @xmath12 is a complex and @xmath11 is a real function .",
    "expanding them to the first order , we get a general form @xmath17 where again we use the standard terminology , but this time for the * resonant pole parameters * : mass @xmath18 , total decay width @xmath19 , residue magnitude @xmath20 , and residue phase @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , there are two real parameters : the background @xmath22 and its phase @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath11 is a real function , these parameters are not independent , which allows us to eliminate @xmath22 @xmath23 to simplify the notation , we introduce the branching fraction @xmath24 and the phase difference @xmath25 putting it all together , the amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ linearamplitude ] ) becomes @xmath26 where the resonant phase shift @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 basically , this is an * improved breit - wigner formula * with five independent parameters : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and the new parameter @xmath0 , which we call the breit - wigner phase .",
    "this new phase parameter @xmath0 is the difference between the amplitude s phase at the energy equal to the pole mass @xmath18 and @xmath29 .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we have phenomenologically obtained a relation for @xmath30 , which is in full agreement with the result we get here by squaring the magnitude of eq .",
    "( [ amplitudefinal ] ) . the peak position of @xmath30 , labeled here as @xmath31 ,",
    "is given by @xmath32 it is , therefore , no surprise that this is exactly the same formula we have got in ref .",
    "next , we propose a few additional mass formulas derivable from eq .",
    "( [ amplitudefinal ] ) .",
    "we obtain the second mass formula by analyzing the imaginary part of @xmath8 and noting that it has a peak at some energy , which we call @xmath33 , with the value @xmath34 this formula could be very useful because due to the optical theorem , the imaginary part of the elastic amplitude is related to the total cross section @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , we get @xmath35 by replacing @xmath30 with @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ breitwignerformula ] ) .",
    "the third and arguably the most important mass formula is obtained by linear expansion of the numerator and denominator in eq .",
    "( [ morerealisticamplitude ] ) , using the standard definition of the * breit - wigner mass * as the zero of the real part of the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ morerealisticamplitude ] ) ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath37    the * breit - wigner width * is then given by , which is a useful relation for consistency checking .",
    "furthermore , note that @xmath38 is also the peak of @xmath39 and that it is given by the energy at which , the phase of @xmath8 , crosses @xmath29 . before proceeding",
    "any further we need to address the issue of the * breit - wigner mass non - physicality * pointed out by scherer et al .  in @xcite and sirlin in @xcite .",
    "they have shown that a quantum field transformation , which does not change observables nor pole parameters , will change the breit - wigner mass if it is defined as the zero of the real part of the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ morerealisticamplitude ] ) .",
    "however , since the transformation changes the denominator but does not change the amplitude itself ( otherwise it would change the observables as well ) , we can consistently redefine the breit - wigner mass using the whole invariant resonant amplitude , both the denominator and numerator , and it will be invariant to the transformation : * the breit - wigner mass is the energy at which the real part of the resonant amplitude becomes zero * , i.e. , when its phase crosses @xmath29 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ bwmass ] ) is still valid . to test the proposed mass formulas",
    ", we use them on a familiar example : the z boson .",
    "the resonant amplitude of the z boson is given by @xcite @xmath40 all parameters in this relation are the breit - wigner parameters .",
    "to test the formulas , we extract the pole parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath21 directly from this relation .",
    "then we use the mass formulas to reproduce the breit - wigner parameters .",
    "first we note that , by construction , the peak of @xmath41 is at the same position as the peak of @xmath30",
    ". therefore @xmath42 must be equal to @xmath43 , as is evident by comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ mpeak ] ) and ( [ mim ] ) .",
    "in addition , since @xmath0 is @xmath44 , it will also be equal to @xmath43 .",
    "finally , we calculate the breit - wigner parameters using eq .",
    "( [ bwmass ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the original breit - wigner parameters from ref .",
    "@xcite and those obtained by eqs .",
    "( [ mpeak]-[bwmass ] ) turn out to be excellent , as can be seen in table [ zbosontable ] .",
    ".agreement between the pdg values of the z - boson resonant parameters and those obtained by using the mass formulas ( [ mpeak]-[bwmass ] ) applied to the z - boson amplitude ( [ arzboson ] ) [ zbosontable ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ amplitudefinal ] ) is , in fact , a matrix element of the full amplitude matrix @xmath45 in channel indices @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "each process from channel @xmath46 to channel @xmath47 ( e.g. ,  from @xmath48 to @xmath49 ) is described by a corresponding matrix element @xmath50 when the unitarity constraint is imposed on the amplitude matrix , @xmath51 , we immediately see that it can not be satisfied unless all parameters @xmath52 are the same for all processes . *",
    "consequently , the phase @xmath0 must be the same in all processes due to unitarity .",
    "*    since @xmath0 is invariant , we rewrite the amplitude as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a real symmetrical matrix given by @xmath55 . imposing unitarity on this form",
    "drastically simplifies it and gives us @xmath56 , i.e. , that @xmath57 is a projection matrix .",
    "since @xmath57 is symmetrical projection matrix , the trace of @xmath57 equals its rank .",
    "therefore , we get @xmath58 consequently , the trace of the amplitude s real part will be zero , while the trace of the imaginary part will have a maximum at the energy equal to the breit - wigner mass , since @xmath59 equals @xmath29 there .",
    "that is somewhat extraordinary because this result from a simple , non - analytic , single - resonance model with only a few free parameters is in perfect agreement with the result of a full - scale , analytic , unitary , coupled - channel , and mutiresonance analysis we did in ref .",
    "there , we have noted that these peaks and zeros curiously correspond to the breit - wigner masses of n@xmath60 resonances , but also to the real poles of the k - matrix , which was all highly controversial at the time ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    and",
    "what about the k - matrix within the model proposed here ?",
    "the k - matrix is defined as , where @xmath61 is the unit matrix , from which we get @xmath62 this @xmath57 is the same as the one in eq .",
    "( [ amplitudex ] ) .",
    "evidently , the k - matrix trace will have poles at the breit - wigner masses , exactly as it was reported in ref .",
    "in conclusion , we propose the breit - wigner phase @xmath0 as the new fundamental resonance parameter because it is the same in all processes , directly connects the breit - wigner to the pole mass and width , shifts the complex phase of the resonant amplitude , and links the k - matrix poles with the breit - wigner masses .",
    "therefore , we suggest that @xmath0 is added to resonance properties tables ( perhaps instead of the breit - wigner mass and width ) .",
