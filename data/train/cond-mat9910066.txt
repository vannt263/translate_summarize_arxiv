    "perovskite - like oxides have been at the center of research on ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials for the past fifty years because of their simple cubic structure at high temperatures and the variety of high symmetry phases with polar states found at lower temperatures . among these materials the ferroelectric pbzr@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pzt ) solid solutions have attracted special attention since they exhibit an unusual phase boundary which divides regions with rhombohedral and tetragonal structures , called the `` morphotropic phase boundary '' ( mpb ) by jaffe _ et al._@xcite . materials in this region exhibit a very high piezoelectric response , and it has been conjectured that these two features are intrinsically related .",
    "the simplicity of the perovskite structure is in part responsible for the considerable progress made recently in the determination of the basic structural properties and stability of phases of some important perovskite oxides , based on _ ab - initio _ calculations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , such calculations have also been used to investigate solid solutions and , in particular , pzt , where the effective hamiltonian includes both structural and compositional degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the pzt phase diagram of jaffe _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which covers only temperatures above 300 k , has been accepted as the basic characterization of the pzt solid solution .",
    "the ferroelectric region of the phase diagram consists mainly of two different regions : the zr - rich rhombohedral region , ( f@xmath14 ) that contains two phases with space groups r3 m and r3c , and the ti - rich tetragonal region ( f@xmath15 ) , with space group p4mm@xcite .",
    "the two regions are separated by a boundary that is nearly independent of temperature , the mpb mentioned above , which lies at a composition close to x= 0.47 .",
    "many structural studies have been reported around the mpb , since the early 1950 s , when these solid solutions were first studied@xcite , since the high piezoelectric figure - of - merit that makes pzt so extraordinary is closely associated with this line @xcite .the difficulty in obtaining good single crystals in this region , and the characteristics of the boundary itself , make good compositional homogeneity essential if single phase ceramic materials are to be obtained .",
    "because of this , the mpb is frequently reported as a region of phase - coexistence whose width depends on the sample processing conditions@xcite .",
    "recently , an entirely new feature of the morphotropic phase boundary has been revealed by the discovery of a new ferroelectric monoclinic phase ( f@xmath16 ) in the pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath1)o@xmath2 ceramic system@xcite . from a synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction study of a composition with x=0.48",
    ", a tetragonal - to - monoclinic phase transition was discovered at @xmath9300 k. the monoclinic unit cell is such that a@xmath5 and b@xmath5 lay along the tetragonal @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 $ ] directions ( a@xmath19 b@xmath19 a@xmath202 ) , and c@xmath5 deviates slightly from the [ 001 ] direction ( c@xmath19 c@xmath4)@xcite .",
    "the space group is cm , and the temperature dependence of the monoclinic angle @xmath6 gives immediately the evolution of the order parameter for the tetragonal - monoclinic ( f@xmath15-f@xmath21 ) transition .",
    "the polar axis of the monoclinic cell can in principle be directed along any direction within the _ ac _ mirror plane , making necessary a detailed structural study to determine its direction .    in the present work we present such a detailed structure determination of the monoclinic phase at 20 k and the tetragonal phase at 325 k in pzt with x= 0.48 .",
    "the results show that the polarization in the monoclinic plane lies along a direction between the pseudo - cubic [ 001]@xmath22 and [ 111]@xmath22 directions , corresponding to the first example of a species with p@xmath23= p@xmath24 p@xmath25 .",
    "a tentative phase diagram is presented in figure 1 , which includes data for the x= 0.48 composition together with those of the recently - studied x= 0.50 composition @xcite .",
    "the most striking finding , however , is that the monoclinic cation displacements found here correspond to one of the three locally disordered sites reported by corker _",
    "@xcite for rhombohedral compositions in the region x= 0.1 - 0.4 , and thus provide a microscopic model of the rhombohedral - to - monoclinic phase transition .",
    "this , together with the fact that the space group of the new phase , cm , is a subgroup of both p4 mm and r3 m , suggests that f@xmath21 represents an intermediate phase connecting the well - known f@xmath15 and f@xmath14 pzt phases .",
    "a pzt sample with x= 0.48 was prepared by conventional solid - state reaction techniques using appropriate amounts of reagent - grade powders of lead carbonate , zirconium oxide and titanium oxide , with chemical purities better than 99.9@xmath26 .",
    "pellets were pressed and heated to 1250@xmath27c at a ramp rate of 10@xmath27c / min , held at this temperature in a covered crucible for 2 hours , and furnace - cooled . during sintering , pbzro@xmath2 was used as a lead source in the crucible to minimize volatilization of lead .",
    "high - resolution synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction measurements were made at beam line x7a at the brookhaven national synchrotron light source . in the first set of measurements ,",
    "an incident beam of wavelength 0.6896   from a ge(111 ) double - crystal monochromator was used in combination with a ge(220 ) crystal and scintillation detector in the diffraction path .",
    "the resulting instrumental resolution is about 0.01@xmath27 on the 2@xmath28 scale , an order - of - magnitude better than that of a laboratory instrument .",
    "data were collected from a disk in symmetric flat - plate reflection geometry over selected angular regions in the temperature range 20 - 736 k. coupled @xmath28- 2@xmath28 scans were performed over selected angular regions with a 2@xmath29 step interval of 0.01@xmath27 .",
    "the sample was rocked 1 - 2@xmath27 during data collection to improve powder averaging .",
    "measurements above room temperature were performed with the disk mounted on a bn sample pedestal inside a wire - wound bn tube furnace .",
    "the furnace temperature was measured with a thermocouple mounted just below the pedestal and the temperature scale calibrated with a sample of caf@xmath30 .",
    "the accuracy of the temperature in the furnace is estimated to be within 10 k , and the temperature stability about 2 k. for low temperature measurements , the pellet was mounted on a cu sample pedestal and loaded in a closed - cycle he cryostat , which has an estimated temperature accuracy of 2 k and stability better than 0.1 k. the diffracted intensities were normalized with respect to the incident beam monitor .    for the second set of measurements aimed at the detailed determination of the structure , a linear position - sensitive detector was mounted on the 2@xmath29 arm of the diffractometer instead of the crystal analyzer , and a wavelength of 0.7062   was used .",
    "this configuration gives greatly - enhanced counting rates which make it feasible to collect accurate data from very narrow - diameter capillary samples in debye - scherrer geometry , with the advantage that systematic errors due to preferred orientation or texture effects are largely eliminated . a small piece of the sintered disk was carefully crushed and sealed into a 0.2 mm diameter glass capillary .",
    "the latter was loaded into a closed - cycle cryostat , and extended data sets were collected at 20 and 325 k while the sample was rocked over a 10@xmath27range . with this geometry the instrumental resolution is about 0.03@xmath27 on the 2@xmath28 scale . because lead is highly absorbing , the data were corrected for absorption effects@xcite based on an approximate value of @xmath31 determined from the weight and dimensions of the sample .",
    "the evolution of the lattice parameters with temperature was briefly summarized in ref.[20 ] , and a more complete analysis is presented below . *  * the results of the full structure analysis are described later .    a transition from the cubic to the tetragonal phase was observed at @xmath9660 k , in agreement with the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "1 . the measurements made on the pellet in the cubic phase at 736 k demonstrate the excellent quality of the sample , which exhibits diffraction peaks with full - widths at half - maximum ( fwhm ) ranging from 0.01 to 0.03@xmath27 as shown for the ( 111 ) reflection plotted as the upper - right inset in fig .",
    "the fwhm s ( @xmath32 ) for several peaks were determined from least - squares fits to a pseudo - voigt function with the appropriate corrections for asymmetry effects @xcite , and corrected for instrumental resolution .",
    "the corrected values are shown in fig . 2 in the form of a williamson - hall plot @xcite    @xmath33@xmath34 where @xmath35 is the wavelength and @xmath36 is the mean crystallite size . from the slope of a linear fit to the data ,",
    "the distribution of d - spacings , @xmath37d / d , is estimated to be @xmath38 , corresponding to a compositional inhomogeneity @xmath39x of less than @xmath400.003*. * from the intercept of the line on the ordinate axis the mean crystallite size is estimated to be @xmath91 @xmath41 m .",
    "a tetragonal - to - monoclinic phase transition in pzt with x= 0.48 was recently reported by noheda _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "additional data have been obtained near the phase transition around 300 k which have allowed a better determination of the phase transition to be made , as shown by the evolution of the lattice parameters as a function of temperature in figure 3 .",
    "the tetragonal strain , c@xmath4/a@xmath4 , increases as the temperature decreases from the curie point ( t@xmath42 660k ) , to a value of 1.0247 at 300 k , below which peak splittings characteristic of a monoclinic phase with a@xmath43 b@xmath19 a@xmath44 , @xmath45 , are observed ( figure 3 ) . as the temperature continues to decrease down to 20 k , a@xmath5 ( which is defined to lie along the [ @xmath460 ] tetragonal direction ) increases very slightly , and b@xmath5 ( which lies along the [ 1@xmath470 ] tetragonal direction ) decreases .",
    "the c@xmath5 lattice parameter reaches a broad maximum value of 4.144   between 240 - 210 k and then reaches a shallow minimum value of 4.137   at 60 k.  over the same temperature region there is a striking variation of @xmath39d / d determined from williamson - hall plots at various temperatures , as shown in the upper - left inset in fig .",
    "@xmath39d / d increases rapidly  as the temperature approaches the f@xmath15-f@xmath21 transition at 300k , in a similar fashion to the tetragonal strain , and then decreases rapidly below this temperature in the monoclinic region .",
    "thus the microstrain responsible for the large increase in @xmath39d / d is an important feature of the phase transition , which may be associated with the development of local monoclinic order , and is very likely responsible for the large electromechanical response of pzt close to the mpb @xcite .",
    "the deviation of the monoclinic angle @xmath6 from 90@xmath27 is an order parameter of the f@xmath15-f@xmath21 transition , and its evolution with temperature is also depicted in figure 3 .",
    "this phase transition presents a special problem due to the steepness of the phase boundary ( the mpb in fig .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the compositional fluctuations are quite small in these ceramic samples ( @xmath39x@xmath42 @xmath400.003 ) but , even in this case , the nature of the mpb implies an associated temperature uncertainty of @xmath39t@xmath42 100 k. there is , therefore , a rather wide range of transition temperatures instead of a single well - defined transition , so that the order parameter is smeared out as a function of temperature around the phase change , thereby concealing the nature of the transition .",
    "scans over the ( 220)@xmath22 region for several different temperatures are plotted in figure 4 , which shows the evolution of phases from the cubic phase at 687 k ( upper - left plot ) to the monoclinic phase at 20 k ( lower - right plot ) , passing through the tetragonal phase at intermediate temperatures . with decreasing temperature",
    ", the tetragonal phase appears at @xmath48660 k and the development of the tetragonal distortion can be observed on the left side of the figure from the splitting of the ( 202)@xmath4 and ( 220)@xmath4 reflections .",
    "on the right side of the figure , the evolution of the monoclinic phase , which appears below @xmath9300 k , is shown by the splitting into the ( 22@xmath49)@xmath5 , ( 222)@xmath5 , ( 400)@xmath5 and ( 040)@xmath5 monoclinic reflections .",
    "it is quite evident from fig .",
    "4 that the ( 202)@xmath4 peak is much broader than the neighboring ( 220)@xmath4 peak , for example , and this `` anisotropic '' peak broadening is a general feature of the diffraction data for both phases .",
    "another feature of the patterns is the presence of additional diffuse scattering between neighboring peaks , which is particularly evident between tetragonal ( 00l ) and ( h00 ) pairs , and the corresponding monoclinic ( 00l ) and ( hh0 ) pairs .",
    "a detailed analysis of the 325 k tetragonal and 20 k monoclinic structures of pbzr@xmath50ti@xmath51o@xmath2 was carried out by rietveld refinement using the gsas program package @xcite .",
    "the pseudo - voigt peak shape function option was chosen@xcite and background was estimated by linear interpolation between fixed values .",
    "an important feature of the refinements was the need to allow for the anisotropic peak broadening mentioned above .",
    "this was accomplished by the use of the recently - incorporated generalized model for anisotropic peak broadening proposed by stephens@xcite , which is based on a distribution of lattice parameters .",
    "it was also necessary to take into account some additional diffuse scattering by modeling with a second , cubic , phase with broad , predominately gaussian , peaks .",
    "a similar strategy has been adopted by muller _",
    "et al._@xcite in a recent study of pbhf@xmath52ti@xmath53o@xmath2 .",
    "although in principle this could represent a fraction of untransformed cubic phase , we suspect that the diffuse scattering is associated with locally disordered regions in the vicinity of domain walls .",
    "the refinements were carried out with the atoms assigned fully - ionized scattering factors .      at 325",
    "k the data show tetragonal symmetry similar to that of pbtio@xmath2 .",
    "this tetragonal structure has the space group p4 mm with pb in 1(a ) sites at ( 0 , 0 , z ) ; zr / ti and o(1 ) in 1(b ) sites at ( 1/2 , 1/2 , z ) and o@xmath54 in 2(c ) sites at ( 1/2 , 0 , z ) . for the refinement we adopt the same convention as that used in refs.[30 ] and [ 31 ] for pbtio@xmath2 , with pb fixed at ( 0,0,0 ) .",
    "however , instead of thinking in terms of shifts of the other atoms with respect to this origin , it is more physically intuitive to consider displacements of pb and zr / ti from the center of the distorted oxygen cuboctahedra and octahedra , respectively .",
    "we shall take this approach in the subsequent discussion .",
    "the refinement was first carried out with individual isotropic ( u@xmath55 ) temperature factors assigned .",
    "although a reasonably satisfactory fit was obtained ( r@xmath56= 8.9% ) , u@xmath55 for o(1 ) was slightly negative and u@xmath55 for pb was very large , 0.026 @xmath57 , much larger than u@xmath55 for the other atoms .",
    "similarly high values for pb(u@xmath55 ) in pb - based perovskites are well - known in the literature , and are usually ascribed to local disordered displacements , which may be either static or dynamic .",
    "refinement with anisotropic temperature factors @xcite ( u@xmath58 and u@xmath59 ) assigned to pb ( table i , model i ) gave an improved fit ( r@xmath56= 6.1% ) with u@xmath58(= u@xmath60 ) considerably larger than u@xmath59 ( 0.032 and 0.013 @xmath57 , respectively ) corresponding to large displacements perpendicular to the polar [ 001 ] axis . a further refinement based on local displacements of the pb from the 1(a ) site to the 4(d ) sites at ( x , x,0 ) , with isotropic temperature factors assigned to all the atoms * , * gave *  * a small improvement in the fit ( r@xmath56= 6.0% ) with x@xmath61 , corresponding to local shifts along the @xmath10110@xmath11 axes , and a much more reasonable temperature factor ( table i , model ii ) . in order to check",
    "that high correlations between the temperature factor and local displacements were not biasing the result of this refinement , we have applied a commonly - used procedure consisting of a series of refinements based on model ii in which pb displacements along @xmath10110@xmath11 were fixed but all the other parameters were varied @xcite .",
    "5 shows unambiguously that there is well - defined minimum in the r - factor for a displacement of about 0.19  , consistent with the result in table i. a similar minimum was obtained for shifts along @xmath10100@xmath11 directions with a slightly higher r - factor .",
    "thus , in addition to a shift of 0.48   for pb along the polar [ 001 ] axis towards four of its o(2 ) neighbors , similar to that in pbtio@xmath2 , there is a strong indication of substantial local shifts of @xmath90.2 perpendicular to this axis .",
    "the zr / ti displacement is 0.27   along the polar axis , once again similar to the ti shift in pbtio@xmath2 .",
    "attempts to model local displacements along @xmath10110@xmath11 directions for the zr / ti atoms were unsuccessful due to the large correlations between these shifts and the temperature factor .",
    "further attempts to refine the z parameters of the zr and ti atoms independently , as corker _",
    "_ were able to do@xcite , were likewise unsuccessful , presumably because the scattering contrast for x - rays is much less than for neutrons .    from the values of the atomic coordinates listed in table [ table1 ]",
    ", it can be inferred that the oxygen octahedra are somewhat more distorted than in pbtio@xmath2 , the o(1 ) atoms being displaced 0.08   towards the o(2 ) plane above .",
    "the cation displacements are slightly larger than those recently reported by wilkinson _",
    "@xcite for samples close to the mpb containing a mixture of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases , and in excellent agreement with the theoretical values obtained by l. bellaiche and d. vanderbilt @xcite for pzt with x= 0.50 from first principles calculations .",
    "as far as we are aware no other structural analysis of pzt compositions in the tetragonal region has been reported in the literature .    selected bond distances for the two models are shown in table [ table2 ] . for model i ,",
    "zr / ti has short and long bonds with o(1 ) of 1.85 and 2.29  , respectively , and four intermediate - length o(2 ) bonds of 2.05  .",
    "there are four intermediate - length pb - o(1 ) bonds  of 2.89  , four short pb - o(2 ) bonds of 2.56   and four much larger pb - o(2 ) distances of 3.27 . for model",
    "ii , the zr / ti - o distances are the same , but the pb - o distances change significantly .",
    "a pb atom in one of the four equivalent ( x , x,0 ) sites in table [ table1 ] now has a highly distorted coordination , consisting of two short and two intermediate pb - o(2 ) bonds of 2.46 and 2.67  , and one slightly longer pb - o(1 ) bond of 2.71   ( table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the tendency of pb@xmath62 , which has a *  * lone *  * sp electron pair , to form short covalent bonds with a few neighboring oxygens is well documented in the literature@xcite .",
    "the observed and calculated diffraction profiles and the difference plot are shown in figure [ fig6 ] for a selected @xmath63 range between 7 and 34@xmath64 ( upper figure ) .",
    "the short vertical markers represent the calculated peak positions .",
    "the upper and lower sets of markers correspond to the cubic and tetragonal phases , respectively .",
    "we note that although agreement between the observed and the calculated profiles is considerably better when the diffuse scattering is modeled with a cubic phase , the refined values of the atomic coordinates are not significantly affected by the inclusion of this phase .",
    "the anisotropic peak broadening was found to be satisfactorily described by two of the four parameters in the generalized model for tetragonal asymmetry@xcite .      as discussed above ,",
    "the diffraction data at 20 k can be indexed unambiguously  on the basis of a monoclinic cell with space group cm . in this case",
    "pb , zr / ti and o(1 ) are in 2(a ) sites at ( x , 0 , z ) , and o(2 ) in 4(b ) sites at ( x , y , z ) .",
    "individual isotropic temperature factors were assigned , and pb was fixed at ( 0,0,0 ) . for monoclinic symmetry , the generalized expression for anisotropic",
    "peak broadening contains nine parameters , but when all of these were allowed to vary the refinement was slightly unstable and did not completely converge .",
    "after several tests in which some of the less significant values were fixed at zero , satisfactory convergence was obtained with 3 parameters ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) . during these tests , there was essentially no change in the refined values of the atomic coordinates .",
    "a small improvement in the fit was obtained when anisotropic temperature factors were assigned to pb ( @xmath67 @xmath68 ) .",
    "the final results are listed in table [ table3 ] , and the profile fit and difference plot are shown in the lower part of fig . [ fig6 ] .    from an inspection of the results in tables [ table1 ] and [ table3 ]",
    ", it can be seen that the displacements of the pb and zr / ti atoms along [ 001 ] are very similar to those in the tetragonal phase at 325 k , about 0.53 and 0.24 , respectively .",
    "however , in the monoclinic phase at 20 k , there are also significant shifts of these atoms along the monoclinic [ @xmath4700 ] , i.e. pseudo - cubic @xmath69 $ ] , towards their o(2 ) neighbors in adjacent pseudo - cubic ( 110 ) planes , of about 0.24 and 0.11  , respectively , which corresponds to a rotation of the polar axis from [ 001 ] towards pseudo - cubic [ 111 ] .",
    "the pb shifts are also qualitatively consistent with the local shifts of pb along the tetragonal @xmath70 axes inferred from the results of model ii in table [ table1 ] , i.e. about 0.2  .",
    "thus it seems very plausible that the monoclinic phase results from the condensation of the local pb displacements in the tetragonal phase along one of the @xmath71110@xmath11 directions .",
    "some selected bond distances are listed in table [ table2 ] .",
    "the zr / ti - o(1 ) distances are much the same as in the tetragonal structure , but the two sets of zr / ti - o(2 ) distances are significantly different , 1.96 and 2.13  , compared to the single set at 2.04   in the tetragonal structure . except for a shortening in the pb - o(1 )",
    "distance from 2.71 to 2.60  , the pb environment is quite similar to that in the tetragonal phase , with two close o(2 ) neighbors at 2.46  , and two at 2.64  .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that the low - temperature monoclinic structure of pbzr@xmath50ti@xmath51o@xmath2 is derived from the tetragonal structure by shifts of the pb and zr / ti atoms along the tetragonal [ 110 ] axis .",
    "we attribute this phase transition to the condensation of local @xmath71110@xmath11 shifts of pb which are present in the tetragonal phase along one of the four @xmath10110@xmath11 directions . in the context of this monoclinic structure",
    "it is instructive to consider the structural model for rhombohedral pzt compositions with x= 0.08 - 0.38 recently reported by corker _",
    "el al._@xcite on the basis of neutron powder diffraction data collected at room temperature . in this study and also an earlier study@xcite of a sample with",
    "x= 0.1 , it was found that satisfactory refinements could only be achieved with anisotropic temperature factors , and that the thermal ellipsoid for pb had the form of a disk perpendicular to the pseudo - cubic [ 111 ] axis .",
    "this highly unrealistic situation led them to a physically much more plausible model involving local displacements for the pb atoms of about 0.25   perpendicular to the [ 111 ] axis and a much smaller and more isotropic thermal ellipsoid .",
    "evidence for local shifts of pb atoms in pzt ceramics has also been demonstrated by pair - distribution function analysis by teslic and coworkers@xcite .",
    "we now consider the refined values of the pb atom positions with local displacements for rhombohedral pzt listed in table 4 of ref.[23 ] . with the use of the appropriate transformation matrices ,",
    "it is straightforward to show that these shifts correspond to displacements of 0.2 - 0.25   along the direction of the monoclinic [ 100 ] axis , similar to what is actually observed for x= 0.48 .",
    "it thus seems equally plausible that the monoclinic phase can also result from the condensation of local displacements perpendicular to the [ 111 ] axis .",
    "the monoclinic structure can thus be pictured as providing a `` bridge '' between the rhombohedral and tetragonal structures in the region of the mpb .",
    "this is illustrated in table [ table4 ] , which compares the results for pzt with x=0.48 obtained in the present study with earlier results@xcite for rhombohedral pzt with x= 0.40 expressed in terms of the monoclinic cell@xcite . for x= 0.48 ,",
    "the atomic coordinates for zr / ti , o(1 ) and o(2 ) are listed for the `` ideal '' tetragonal structure ( model i ) and for a similar structure with local shifts of ( 0.03 , 0.03 , 0 ) in the first two columns , and for the monoclinic structure in the third column . the last two columns describe the rhombohedral structure for x= 0.40 assuming local shifts of ( -0.02 , 0.02 , 0 ) along the hexagonal axes and the as - refined `` ideal '' structure , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the condensation of these local shifts gives a very plausible description of the monoclinic structure in both cases .",
    "it is also interesting to note the behavior of the corresponding lattice parameters ; metrically the monoclinic cell is very similar to the tetragonal cell except for the monoclinic angle , which is close to that of the rhombohedral cell .",
    "evidence for a tetragonal - to - monoclinic transition in the ferroelectric material pbfe@xmath72nb@xmath72o@xmath2 has also been reported by bonny _",
    "et al._@xcite from single crystal and synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction measurements .",
    "the latter data show a cubic - tetragonal transition at @xmath9376k , and a second transition at @xmath9355k .",
    "although the resolution was not sufficient to reveal any systematic splitting of the peaks , it was concluded that the data were consistent with a very weak monoclinic distortion of the pseudo - rhombohedral unit cell . in a recent neutron and x - ray powder study , lampis _",
    "@xcite have shown that rietveld refinement gives better agreement for the monoclinic structure at 80 and 250 k than for the rhombohedral one .",
    "the resulting monoclinic distortion is very weak , and the large thermal factor obtained for pb is indicative of a high degree of disorder .    the relationships between the pzt rhombohedral , tetragonal and monoclinic structures are also shown schematically in figure 7 , in which the displacements of the pb atom are shown projected on the pseudo - cubic ( 110 ) mirror plane .",
    "the four locally disordered @xmath70 shifts postulated in the present paper for the tetragonal phase are shown superimposed on the [ 001 ] shift at the left ( fig.7a ) and the three locally disordered @xmath73 shifts proposed by corker _",
    "et al._@xcite for the rhombohedral phase are shown superimposed on the [ 111 ] shift at the right ( fig .",
    "it can be seen that both the condensation of the [ 110 ] shift in the tetragonal phase and the condensation of the [ 001 ] shift in the rhombohedral phase leads to the observed monoclinic shift shown at the center ( fig .",
    "7b ) . we note that although corker _",
    "_ discuss their results in terms of @xmath73 shifts and a [ 111 ] shift smaller than that predicted in the usual refinement procedure , they can be equally well described by a combination of shifts perpendicular to the [ 111 ] axis and the [ 111 ] shift actually obtained in the refinement , as is evident from fig . 7c .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the f@xmath21 phase establishes a connection between the pzt phases at both sides of the mpb through the common symmetry element , the mirror plane , and suggest that there is not really a morphotropic phase boundary , but rather a `` morphotropic phase '' , connecting the f@xmath15 and f@xmath14 phases of pzt .    in the monoclinic phase the difference vector between the positive and negative centers of charge defines the polar axis ,",
    "whose orientation , in contrast to the case of the f@xmath15 and f@xmath14 phases , can not be determined on symmetry grounds alone . according to this , from the results shown in table [ table3 ] , the polar axis in the monoclinic phase",
    "is found to be tilted about 24@xmath27 from the [ 001 ] axis towards the [ 111 ] axis .",
    "this structure represents the first example of a ferroelectric material with p@xmath74= p@xmath75 @xmath76p@xmath25 , ( p@xmath1 , p@xmath77 , p@xmath78 ) being the cartesian components of the polarization vector .",
    "this class corresponds to the so - called m3m(12)a2fm type predicted by shuvalov @xcite .",
    "it is possible that this new phase is one of the rare examples of a two - dimensional ferroelectric @xcite in which the unit cell dipole moment switches within a plane containing the polar axis , upon application of an electric field .",
    "this new f@xmath21 phase has important implications ; for example , it might explain the well - known shifts of the anomalies of many physical properties with respect to the mpb and thus help in understanding the physical properties in this region , of great interest from the applications point - of - view@xcite .",
    "it has been found that the maximum values of d@xmath79 for rhombohedral pzt with x= 0.40 are not obtained for samples polarized along the [ 111 ] direction but along a direction close to the perovskite [ 001 ] direction @xcite .",
    "this points out the intrinsic importance of the [ 001 ] direction in perovskites , whatever the distortion present , and is consistent with corker _",
    "et al . _ s model for the rhombohedral phase@xcite , and the idea of the rhombohedral - tetragonal transition through a monoclinic phase .",
    "it is also to be expected that other systems with morphotropic phase boundaries between two non - symmetry - related phases ( e.g. , other perovskites or tungsten - bronze mixed systems ) may show similar intermediate phases .",
    "in fact , an indication of symmetry lowering at the mpb of the pzn - pt system has been recently reported by fujishiro _",
    "_ @xcite . from a different point - of - view",
    ", a monoclinic ferroelectric perovskite also represents a new challenge for first - principles theorists , until now used to dealing only with tetragonal , rhombohedral and orthorhombic perovskites .    a structural analysis of several other pzt compositions with x= 0.42 - 0.51 is currently in progress in order to determine the new pzt phase diagram more precisely .",
    "in the preliminary version shown in fig .",
    "1 we have included data for a sample with x= 0.50 made under slightly different conditions@xcite at the institute of ceramic and glass ( icg ) in madrid , together with the data described in the present work for a sample with x= 0.48 synthesized in the materials research laboratory at the pennsylvania state university ( psu ) . as can be seen the results for these two compositions show consistent behavior , and demonstrate that the f@xmath21-f@xmath15 phase boundary lies along jaffe _",
    "preliminary results for a sample from psu with x= 0.47 show unequivocally that the monoclinic features are present at 300 k. however measurements on an icg sample with the same nominal composition do not show monoclinicity unambiguously , but instead a rather complex poorly - defined region from 300 - 400k between the rhombohedral and tetragonal phases@xcite .",
    "the extension of the monoclinic region and the location of the f@xmath14-f@xmath21 phase boundary are still somewhat undefined , although it is clear that the monoclinic region has a narrower composition range as the temperature increases .",
    "the existence of a quadruple point in the pzt phase diagram is an interesting possibility .",
