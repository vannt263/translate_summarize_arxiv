    "in the determination of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the proton from fitting to the available deep - inelastic and related hard - scattering data , a long - standing question is the extent to which the limitations of a fixed form of the input parameterisations affect the best fit and the uncertainty of the resulting pdfs .",
    "it is certainly the case that various groups performing ` global ' pdf analyses have had to introduce new parameters to facilitate a good - quality fit to some new data , either because they probe a new pdf combination or a new kinematic range , or simply because new data are much more precise than previous measurements .",
    "this has resulted in most groups performing fits to a wide variety of data sets @xcite using about 4 - 6 free parameters for each type of parton .",
    "the nnpdf group @xcite circumvents this issue by using effectively an extremely large and flexible parameterisation , but in order to avoid fitting all the fluctuations in data , they must split data into training and validation sets and have algorithms which determine the methods of both convergence and ` stopping ' .",
    "this means they do not have an easily identifiable ` best fit ' and it is very difficult to compare the sources of their pdf uncertainty to those for other groups .",
    "indeed , there has been clear sensitivity to their convergence and ` stopping ' algorithms , though this has been quite small since the set in @xcite .",
    "it is hypothesised that the lack of parameter flexibility is part of the reason for the need for a ` tolerance ' , or the use of ` @xmath15 ' , to obtain uncertainties in the mstw ( and cteq ) fits .",
    "but studies so far suggest that while this is probably a component , it is not all , or even the dominant reason for this need for inflation of @xmath16 @xcite ( see , for example , a discussion of relative uncertainties between sets in @xcite ) .",
    "so far , there has been surprisingly little investigation of the change of the form of input parameterisations on the uncertainties of pdf sets based on a best fit and expansion about this central pdf set .",
    "there are studies by pumplin @xcite , by glazov , moch and radescu @xcite , and one sentence in the mstw conference proceedings @xcite .    in this article",
    "we investigate the effect of extending the mstw parameterisation of the input pdfs by changing the interpolating polynomial @xmath17 , which was introduced for separate up and down valence and for sea quarks in @xcite , to a term including up to an @xmath18-order chebyshev polynomial .",
    "first , we investigate the most appropriate order of polynomial to use such that sufficient flexibility is achieved , but not so much that one is in danger of fitting fluctuations in the data . to study this , general functions of a suitable shape are generated , and pseudo - data are fitted .",
    "we conclude that about a @xmath19-order polynomial should generally be adequate .",
    "we then try using this type of polynomial in fits to real data , first for the two valence distributions , but also additionally for the sea distribution .",
    "we see a significant improvement in the @xmath20 for the best global fit at both stages , but the only significant change in the pdfs is for the @xmath2 distribution for @xmath21 at high @xmath22 , or slightly higher @xmath1 at low @xmath23 .    at present , and for at least the short - term future , we will have to continue to include the existing deep - inelastic scattering and drell  yan data from deuteron targets to achieve a determination of the pdfs of the different quark flavours , particularly at moderate and large values of @xmath1 .",
    "it is therefore important to repeat our previous study of improving the nonperturbative corrections to the deuteron structure functions @xcite from the default @xcite first used in @xcite , but now using the extended chebyshev parametric forms of the input pdfs .",
    "the results are rather more successful than when using our standard pdf parameterisation , with the deuteron correction being rather similar to that expected from various models , with little variation when different assumptions are made .",
    "the change in deuteron corrections is found to change the @xmath3 distribution to a fairly significant extent .    for the chebyshev input parameterisations , without and with the additional freedom in deuteron corrections",
    ", we demonstrate that a suitable set of pdf uncertainty eigenvectors can be found , using 23 orthogonal directions in parameter space , rather than the 20 used in the standard mstw2008 pdf set .",
    "since it is the valence quark pdfs that are affected , we examine the detailed dependence of quark decomposition on the lepton charge asymmetry ( which results from @xmath24 production ) .",
    "we show that the precise combination , and the @xmath1 range , of the pdfs probed is very dependent on the lepton rapidity and on the lepton @xmath5 cut applied to the data .",
    "the lepton charge asymmetry is particularly sensitive to the small-@xmath1 valence pdfs , and this sensitivity is seen to increase rather dramatically as the @xmath5 cut is raised .",
    "the predictions obtained from the new pdfs ( using chebyshev input parameterisations ) are compared with both the tevatron lepton asymmetry data @xcite that were not used in the mstw2008 fit , and the recent lhc data , namely the atlas lepton rapidity data @xcite and the cms lepton asymmetry data @xcite . in all cases the default mstw2008 pdfs are not optimum for these lepton asymmetry data sets , whereas the new ` chebyshev ' pdfs give much improved predictions even though they are obtained from a fit to _ exactly _ the same global data set as used to determine the mstw2008 pdfs .",
    "although the lepton charge asymmetry , which has extreme sensitivity to the low @xmath1 valence  sea decomposition , is better fit by the change in the pdfs , we check that the predicted values of the @xmath25 , higgs , etc .",
    "total cross sections are essentially _ unaltered_. to be precise , they are only changed by amounts far smaller than those due to the pdf uncertainty .",
    "$ ] of order @xmath26 to 5 as a function of @xmath1 for different arguments for the expansion variable .",
    "the order of the polynomial increases as the structure extends to smaller @xmath1 values .",
    "the order of the polynomial also increases across the visible spectrum ( i.e.  dark blue to red).,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in a recent previous study @xcite , an investigation of the uncertainty of our pdfs using monte carlo generated data replicas was performed , as opposed to the use of perturbations about the best fit as was done in the mstw2008 analysis .",
    "little change was seen when the full 28 mstw pdf parameters were left free compared to the 20 used in eigenvector generation . to be precise , the uncertainty using @xmath27 was compared using the two approaches and significant difference was only seen for the @xmath2 distribution for @xmath21 at the input scale @xmath28 , where the uncertainty band expands a little , and for @xmath3 in some @xmath1 regions .",
    "it was particularly reassuring that there is little change in the uncertainty on the gluon distribution despite the number of free parameters being extended from 4 to 7 . since it is difficult to apply our previously used ` dynamical tolerance ' technique  @xcite for the uncertainty determination to this monte carlo method , and",
    "since there was little change in the results , it was concluded that the eigenvector approach was justified and would continue to be used in our pdf analyses .",
    "nevertheless , there was some evidence that an extended parameterisation might lead to some differences in the pdfs of the valence quarks .",
    "hence , we start by investigating this hypothesis .    for valence and sea quarks the default mstw parameterisation for the input at @xmath29 was taken to be @xmath30 the @xmath31 power , @xmath32 , allows a smooth interpolation to zero as @xmath33 and is inspired by number counting rules .",
    "the single small-@xmath1 power , @xmath34 , is inspired by the behaviour predicted by regge theory at small @xmath1 .",
    "we found long ago that , first at nnlo @xcite , and also with improved data at nlo @xcite , that two terms with different small @xmath1 powers were needed for the gluon distribution to give the best fit .",
    "for the gluon the parameterisation is @xmath35 the input parameterisations for some other distributions , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , take slightly different forms , but these are not very precisely determined , and we will not consider changes to these in this article . similarly , as previously , @xmath38 is taken to be the same as the sea parameterisation except for the normalisation and @xmath31 power , which are left free .",
    "the polynomials , interpolating between the high-@xmath1 and low-@xmath1 limits , have no real motivation other than the separation of half - integer powers being again inspired by regge theory , and the two free parameters seeming to be sufficient to obtain an optimum fit .",
    "an investigation of introducing either an extra parameter of the form @xmath39 or @xmath40 into the valence quark parameterisation was reported very briefly in @xcite since neither had a significant effect on the fit quality  at best they gave @xmath41 .",
    "however , the introduction of an @xmath39 term did change the small-@xmath1 @xmath2 distribution a little outside its uncertainty , and hence , as with the monte carlo study , suggests the uncertainty on this pdf , in the range @xmath42 , is underestimated .         here",
    "we undertake a much more systematic study . as a basis for the interpolating polynomial we decide to use chebyshev polynomials ( though we looked at , and will mention briefly , other possibilities ) .",
    "so we write @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a function of @xmath1 to be specified .",
    "we keep the same form of the @xmath31 and @xmath1 powers in the high- and low-@xmath1 limits .",
    "one of the main motivations for the choice of chebyshev polynomials is that , not only the end points of the polynomials at @xmath45 have magnitude 1 , but each maximum and minimum between the endpoints does also .",
    "other choices , such as legendre polynomials , have maxima and minima with smaller magnitudes so they have smaller variations in magnitude away from the endpoints .",
    "there is still a choice to make regarding the argument @xmath44 of the polynomial .",
    "we need @xmath46 at the lower limit of @xmath1 , i.e.  @xmath47 , and @xmath48 at the other limit @xmath49 , but there are many choices which could satisfy this . in practice",
    "the pdfs are measured between a range of roughly @xmath50 , so we want a choice such that the polynomials vary throughout the whole of this range .",
    "the form of the first few polynomials is shown for various choices in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig19 ] .",
    "clearly @xmath51 is too concentrated at high @xmath1 and @xmath52 extends to too low @xmath1 .",
    "an alternative of @xmath53 is very concentrated at high @xmath1 .",
    "we choose @xmath54 as a convenient definition .",
    "this is the same choice as in the study reported in @xcite .",
    "it is slightly different from the choice in @xcite which used logarithmic dependence rather than powers of @xmath1 , but the results are similar .",
    "a polynomial in @xmath55 also has the feature that it is equivalent to a polynomial in @xmath56 , the same as the default mstw parameterisation , though for a @xmath18-order chebyshev polynomial the maximum power of @xmath1 is @xmath57 .",
    "the half integer separation of terms is consistent with the regge physics motivation of the mstw parameterisation .",
    "pumplin @xcite has explained clearly why a parameterisation like ( [ eq : generalparam ] ) is advantageous .",
    "most previous parameterisations , including mstw , have been based on interpolating functions like those in ( [ eq : mstwparam ] ) with a small number of parameters , @xmath58 .",
    "if the number of parameters is increased to allow more flexibility , the resulting fit becomes unstable , with parameters taking large values and with strong cancellations between the corresponding terms . on the other hand , the parameters , @xmath59 , in the chebyshev form ( [ eq : generalparam ] ) are much more convenient , and well - behaved , for fitting to the data .",
    "the requirement of smoothness in the input pdfs forces the values of the parameters @xmath59 to be reasonably small at large order @xmath60 .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials of increasingly large order , @xmath61 , model the behaviour of the input distribution at an increasingly fine scale in @xmath1 . however , it is still an open question as to how many parameters are needed to model a parton distribution to sufficient accuracy without also starting to fit fluctuations . so far",
    "the standard technique is to impose some artificial restriction such as a requirement on smoothness of the function .    in order to test how many parameters",
    "are indeed needed for a sufficiently good fit we generate pseudo - data for a valence quark input pdf , say @xmath2 , scattered around a function with the general shape of a valence quark distribution obtained from a very large order polynomial @xmath62 with smoothness constraints applied in order to stop it developing kinks .",
    "the function is constrained to give an integrated total of two valence quarks and the fits are all constrained in the same manner .",
    "the 1000 pseudo - data points are distributed evenly in @xmath63 with their percentage error held constant at @xmath64 , i.e.  @xmath65 , and with random scatter about the exact function according to the size of the uncertainty .",
    "we then find the best fit for this pseudo - data using a parameterisation of the form ( [ eq : generalparam ] ) with increasing highest order of the chebyshev polynomials .",
    "this procedure was repeated for a variety of different choices of starting function .",
    "two typical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig33pdf ] which shows the percent deviation of the fit function from the full function for two different starting functions .",
    "the highest order of the polynomial increases across the visible spectrum ( i.e.  dark blue to red ) . just using one term in the polynomial , i.e.  @xmath66 , can give deviations of about @xmath67 over a wide range , but with @xmath68 terms in the polynomial this reduces to mainly a @xmath69 deviation ( in most cases  sometimes 2 polynomials can still give significantly larger deviations @xmath70 ) .",
    "for @xmath71 terms there is generally @xmath72 deviation except at very high @xmath1 .",
    "this does not improve very significantly with further terms added .",

    "a term including up to the @xmath18 order legendre polynomial is just a re - expression of a term including up to the @xmath18-order chebyshev polynomial , the fit quality is the same within numerical accuracy .",

    "the results for two examples are shown in fig .",

    "the greater difficulty in obtaining the excellent description in this case is presumably due both to the lack of the sum rule constraint in the function and the much wider variation in values for the pdf than the valence quark case .",

    "it also seems to be the case that having many more than 4 terms leads to a distinct danger of over - fitting .",
    "also , if there are relatively few data points then it is impossible to get a very accurate representation of the true function , and again too many terms in the polynomial can lead to over - fitting and instability in extrapolation to ranges of @xmath1 outside the data constraint .",
    "this is relevant for pdfs with relatively weak data constraints , such as @xmath37 , @xmath88 and possibly @xmath38 .",
    "uncertainties given by the dot - dashed lines.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    having studied the effects of fitting different ` extended ' input pdf parameterisations to pseudo - data , we now investigate their effect in the real case of fitting to experimental data .",
    "the experimental data points are scattered over a wide range of @xmath23 values , so both the evolution and the input distributions are required to be correct .",
    "also , the data points are for structure functions , and other related high - energy scattering data , which , in general , not only depend on complicated combinations of pdf flavours , but are also related to them via the convolution with perturbative coefficient functions for the specific process .",
    "we perform the fits at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd perturbation theory , though mstw also produce pdfs at leading order ( lo ) and next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) , and we will discuss nnlo results , which are very similar , later",
    ". here , we perform fits to exactly the same data as used for the mstw2008 pdf analysis @xcite , and adopt all the same theory decisions , e.g. heavy flavour schemes , nuclear target corrections , etc . , but now with extended input pdf parameterisations .",
    "uncertainties shown by the dot - dashed lines .",
    "the gluon is shown at @xmath89 rather than the input scale of @xmath90 as the fact it goes negative at small @xmath1 at the latter @xmath23 makes a ratio plot unclear.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    to begin , we apply an extended parameterisation with chebyshev polynomials of highest order @xmath91 only for the valence quark pdfs : @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting improvement to the global fit is quite minor ; corresponding to @xmath92 compared to a total of 2543 for 2699 data points in the mstw2008 fit .",
    "there is a large improvement in the description of the bcdms structure function data @xcite , but a deterioration in the fit to nmc structure function data @xcite .",
    "this is very similar to the results obtained previously by adding just an @xmath39 term to the valence parameterisations @xcite , and , indeed , is similar since chebyshev polynomials in @xmath93 with highest order @xmath91 do add an @xmath94 term , but also a @xmath95 term . as in this previous study ,",
    "the significant change is in @xmath96 for @xmath97 at @xmath98 .",
    "however , it is a larger change than previously .",
    "the comparison to the mstw2008 pdfs at @xmath28 and at @xmath98 with uncertainty bands is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig38 ] and  [ fig : fig39 ] .    a fit is also attempted using @xmath99 as the argument of the chebyshev polynomials , which overlaps with using an extra @xmath100 term in the parameterisation as tried before . as in the previous study @xcite , this results in an improvement in the fit of less than one unit in @xmath20 , and much less change in pdfs .",
    "hence , the use of @xmath101 receives further justification .",
    "we then also applied the extended chebyshev interpolating polynomial to the sea distribution . for the sea ,",
    "the mstw2008 parameterisation was exactly the same form as for the valence quark , i.e.  as in ( [ eq : mstwparam ] ) , so the extended parameterisation also has the same form as that for the valence quark pdfs .",
    "the only difference is that there is no number sum rule directly constraining one parameter , unlike the valence quark pdfs where the normalisation is constrained .",
    "we apply the extended parameterisation for the sea distribution by replacing @xmath17 by a term including chebyshev polynomials with highest order @xmath91 . we tried also extending the parameterisation for the gluon distribution . for the mstw2008 gluon distribution we had the more flexible parameterisation in ( [ eq : mstwgluon ] ) where",
    ", in practice , the second term chooses a negative normalisation .",
    "the normalisation of the first term is set by the momentum sum rule for the pdfs , so in practice there are 7 free parameters .",
    "we replaced the polynomial in the first term by one including chebyshev polynomials with highest order @xmath91 , but both the quality of the fit and the resulting pdfs were essentially unchanged .",
    "this , together with the fact that the gluon already has 7 free parameters , suggests that the extended chebyshev polynomial parameterisation is not necessary .",
    "however , using chebyshev polynomials is a more efficient way of expressing the polynomial in the first term of ( [ eq : mstwgluon ] ) , so we replaced the previous form by an entirely equivalent term using chebyshev polynomials with highest order @xmath102 .",
    "the resulting global fit for the parameterisation with the extended sea quark distribution , and the formally modified , but equivalent , gluon distribution , has @xmath103 .",
    "the improvement is mainly for bcdms structure function data and e866 drell ",
    "yan @xcite and drell  yan asymmetry data @xcite .",
    "again there is a deterioration in the description of the nmc structure function data , but this time a slight improvement in tevatron lepton asymmetry @xcite and @xmath104 rapidity data @xcite .",
    "details will be shown in section 4 .",
    "the pdfs are again shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig38 ] and  [ fig : fig39 ] , and compared to the mstw2008 pdfs and their uncertainty .",
    "the change in @xmath2 is similar to the previous case .",
    "there is more change in @xmath3 this time , but generally within the @xmath105 uncertainty band .",
    "the sea quarks at input show some differences , sometimes a little outside the @xmath105 confidence level uncertainty , but this is essentially washed out by evolution for @xmath98 .",
    "all other pdfs show changes that are very small compared to the mstw2008 uncertainty .    in all our new fits",
    "we let @xmath106 be a free parameter and in all cases it changes by only @xmath107 or less , i.e.  a change much smaller than the uncertainty of @xmath108 or @xmath109 at nlo  @xcite .",
    "the set of pdfs , with chebyshev polynomials of highest order @xmath91 applied to the two valence quarks and sea , and chebyshev polynomials of highest order @xmath102 to the gluon , is denoted by ` mstw2008cp ' below .    as well as studying the central values",
    ", we also investigate the uncertainties of the new pdfs .",
    "the standard mstw2008 pdfs have 28 free parameters in the best fit , but 8 are held fixed when determining the uncertainty eigenvectors because there is too much correlation or anticorrelation between some of the parameters when all are left free .",
    "this freedom would have resulted in the 8 extra potential eigenvectors having an extremely non - quadratic behaviour in @xmath16 ; in general behaving quadratically only in the immediate vicinity of the minimum , then with @xmath16 increasing alarmingly away from this limit .",
    "these are examples of the cases where within a limited range of parameter values the fit quality changes extremely little with changes of some parameters .",
    "however , the actual pdfs tend to remain very similar as the parameters vary in these cases , it simply being a matter of the redundancy in the parameterisation which allows almost identical pdfs with noticeably different parameterisations .    in the mstw2008 analysis ,",
    "all pdfs , except the sea ( and @xmath110 which only has two free parameters ) , have the small-@xmath1 and high-@xmath1 powers @xmath34 and @xmath32 free in the eigenvector determination , the small-@xmath1 power being replaced by the normalisation for the sea . for the gluon the 4 free parameters in the eigenvector determination are the two @xmath32 and @xmath34 values in ( [ eq : mstwgluon ] ) . for valence and sea quarks",
    "we then also let the coefficient of the @xmath111 term in the polynomial , @xmath112 , be free .    for the determination of the uncertainties of the mstw2008cp pdfs , we decide to apply more consistency between the pdfs , and for the sea quarks we let the parameter @xmath34 be free in the eigenvector determination , rather than the normalisation .",
    "for all the pdfs , other than valence quarks and the light sea , we make the same choices as usual . for the valence and sea quark pdfs",
    "we let the coefficients of the first and third chebyshev polynomials , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , be free in the eigenvector determination .",
    "hence we have one more free parameter for each of these pdfs and consequently @xmath115 rather than 20 eigenvectors . despite having one extra free parameter the uncertainty on sea quarks for @xmath116@xmath117 at @xmath98",
    "becomes a little smaller , but becomes noticeably larger for very low @xmath1 .",
    "this is undoubtedly due to the exchange of the normalisation for the small-@xmath1 power as a free parameter .",
    "the most significant change in the uncertainty , however , is in the same pdf as for the change in the central value , i.e.  the small-@xmath1 @xmath2 distribution .",
    "the uncertainty starts to become larger with decreasing @xmath1 at a higher value of @xmath1 , i.e.  about @xmath118 .",
    "indeed , it is markedly larger between @xmath119 and @xmath117 at @xmath98 , where there was a rather tight ` neck ' in the mstw2008 uncertainty of @xmath2 near @xmath120 , and is significantly larger at very small @xmath1 values .",
    "hence , in the new mstw2008cp analysis , the increase in uncertainty in @xmath2 is more in line with where the data constraint finishes , i.e.  about @xmath118 .",
    "all 23 eigenvectors have reasonably quadratic behaviour , the worst being comparable to the worst for mstw2008 . the worst is in fact the eigenvector comprising largely of the first term in the chebyshev polynomial for @xmath3 .",
    "this is explained by the fact that this parameter is highly correlated with both the small-@xmath1 power and the third term in the chebyshev polynomial for the same pdf .",
    "at present , and for at least the short - term future , it is necessary to include the deep - inelastic scattering data on deuteron targets in the global parton analyses , in order to separate the @xmath121 and @xmath122 pdfs at moderate and large @xmath1 values .",
    "studies of the pdfs obtained with collider data only @xcite show much bigger uncertainties for some pdf flavours .",
    "unfortunately , the deuteron measurements are subject to nuclear corrections . with the increased precision and variety of data ( especially with the advent of the decay lepton charge asymmetry measurements from @xmath4 production at the tevatron and lhc )",
    "it is necessary to study the effect of the deuteron corrections in some detail . in previous pdf determinations",
    "we have included the nuclear corrections from @xcite for neutrino structure functions taken with either lead or iron targets , see the discussion in section 7.3 of @xcite , but only included a fixed shadowing correction for small @xmath1 for deuteron structure functions . in the pdf analysis of @xcite , a specific deuteron correction , with associated uncertainty , was applied .",
    "most of the other groups include no deuteron corrections ( the issue does not arise in @xcite ) , although there have been recent specific investigations ( see e.g. @xcite in the context of the cteq - jlab fits , although there are no corrections in @xcite ) which suggest the effect is not insignificant , especially at high @xmath1 .",
    "as we will explain below , we base our study in this article on the assumption that there need not be deuteron corrections , but allow the fit to choose them if required , with some uncertainty determined by the fit quality .",
    "hence , at the very least we allow some new degree of pdf uncertainty to be associated with the possibility of deuteron corrections .",
    "the best fit chooses some small , but significant , corrections at high @xmath1 .      in the default",
    "mstw2008 pdf analysis , deuteron structure functions were corrected only for shadowing at small values of @xmath1 @xcite with a negative correction starting a little above @xmath75 and becoming as much as @xmath123 near @xmath118 . in @xcite",
    "we presented a much more detailed study .",
    "so , first , we briefly summarise the results of this investigation .",
    "basically , we studied the effect of allowing the deuteron corrections to be described by forms with 4 free parameters , which were allowed to vary with no penalty .",
    "it was found that the quality of the global fit could improve by a very large amount with the optimum deuteron corrections .",
    "it was particularly clear that the comparison to the tevatron lepton asymmetry data used in the fit improved a great deal , as did the predictions for more recent versions of these data .",
    "the deuteron corrections required were of the expected general form , see e.g. @xcite , with a large positive correction at very high @xmath1 and a dip for @xmath124 .",
    "however , the dip was somewhat larger than expected , the correction remained negative near @xmath75 where it is likely to be positive due to antishadowing effects , and if anything the fit preferred positive corrections near @xmath125 rather than the negative shadowing corrections .",
    "( indeed , if the shadowing corrections applied in the mstw2008 analysis were to be simply removed , and no deuteron corrections applied , then the fit would improve slightly . ) hence , the adopted corrections seemed unsatisfactory .",
    "given that the extended ` chebyshev ' parameterisation discussed so far automatically allows improvement in the global fit , and has by far the most effect on valence quarks and the light sea , it seems natural to investigate the question of deuteron corrections in this context .",
    "the deuteron corrections applied previously @xcite were of the form @xmath126 where @xmath127 is obtained from @xmath128 just by swapping up and down quarks , and antiquarks , i.e.  isospin symmetry is assumed .",
    "the correction factor @xmath129 is taken to be @xmath23 independent for simplicity and is of the form @xmath130 @xmath131 is a `` pivot point '' for which value the normalisation is set to be @xmath132 . for @xmath133",
    "there is the freedom to increase or decrease smoothly .",
    "the same is true above @xmath134 , but the very large power is also added to allow the expected rapid change of the correction as @xmath33 due to fermi motion . in previous studies @xmath131 was chosen to be 0.08 but here we set @xmath135",
    ". if there is shadowing at low @xmath1 and also a dip for high , but not too high , @xmath1 then @xmath131 is where the correction would take its maximum value , expected to be determined by antishadowing corrections .",
    "thus the 4 free parameters describing the deuteron correction , @xmath129 , are the @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "we do not apply the corrections to the e866 data on drell  yan asymmetry @xcite , and this could be improved in future .",
    "however , in the region of the majority of ( and most precise ) data the correction is very small .",
    "very naively the unconstrained deuteron correction can simply allow the deuteron structure function data to be fit as well as possible while other data sensitive to the separation between up and down quarks determine the pdfs .",
    "however , there are other constraints , such as sum rules , and in practice the many different types of structure function and other data , all depending on different combinations of flavours , in a global fit , makes the situation more complicated . in principle",
    ", extremely precise collider data will make the fit to deuteron data a more - or - less direct fit of deuteron corrections , but this is not yet the case with present data .",
    "the deuteron correction @xcite for the default mstw2008 fit is shown in the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : deutcorrparam ] .",
    "it is negative , i.e.  the total correction factor is @xmath138 below about @xmath139 , but becomes larger in magnitude as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "the correction factor for the best fit in our previous study @xcite is also shown . as explained , it is negative everywhere , except at very high @xmath1 , which seems unlikely .",
    "this gives an improvement in @xmath20 compared to our usual global fit of @xmath140 .",
    "if the normalisation at @xmath131 was fixed to be 1.005 the correction factor obtained had the expected type of shape , i.e.  turned below 1 at the lowest @xmath1 and dipped to a minimum near @xmath141 .",
    "however , this resulted in a fit with @xmath20 30 higher than the free deuteron correction , and as seen the dip is now @xmath142 , which is much lower than shadowing models tend to predict .",
    "the shape is very different from the correction with all parameters left free .",
    "fixing the normalisation to 1.0025 and setting @xmath143 so that the dip is more like @xmath144 , results in a further deterioration of @xmath145 to the fit quality .",
    "this is not particularly significant , but there seemed to be a tension between the best fit and the expected shape of the correction .",
    "we now repeat the exercise using our extended ` chebyshev ' parameterisation for the valence quarks and sea distribution .",
    "the quality of the fit is 86 units of @xmath20 better than that for the mstw2008 fit , i.e.  a little better than when we used the standard pdf parameterisation in our previous study @xcite , and 56 units better than the fit with the same parameterisation and fixed deuteron corrections .",
    "there are very large improvements in the fit to ( i ) the bcdms deuteron structure function data , ( ii ) the e866 drell  yan asymmetry data and ( iii ) the tevatron lepton asymmetry data .",
    "the last improves from @xmath146 in the mstw2008 fit to @xmath147 .",
    "the deuteron correction is shown in the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : deutcorrparam ] . as with our previous study ,",
    "when all parameters are left free , the normalisation is smaller than 1 , but this time by only @xmath148 , rather than over @xmath149 .",
    "there is also still a tendency for the correction to turn up , rather than down , at lowest @xmath1 .",
    "since this last feature is unexpected , we investigate it by fixing @xmath150 , so there is no turn up , but no turn down either .",
    "this only changes the fit quality by @xmath68@xmath151 units ( only a couple of data points really preferring the turn - up ) , and the normalisation is now 1.0007 .",
    "we also try setting the normalisation exactly to unity ; the fit quality and deuteron correction are almost unchanged .",
    "the parameters for the different fits are shown in table  [ tab : deut ] . in all three of these fits , the dip minimises at a value of about 0.975 at @xmath152 .",
    "hence , the deuteron correction is stable as the number of parameters held fixed changes , as is the quality of the fit .",

    "the @xmath20 for the mstw2008 central set is very good , at least as good as the pdf sets of other groups , though the data do not discriminate strongly .",
    "similarly the variation in @xmath20 between mstw2008 eigenvectors is very small : at the absolute most about 2 units in @xmath20 for the 90 data points  though this variation is rather smaller than the few units difference observed between different pdf groups .",
    "hence , there is even less possibility of these data improving the knowledge of a single set of pdfs than there is for them to discriminate between different sets .",
    "as one might expect , the @xmath20 using mstw2008cp and mstw2008cpdeut is hardly changed from that for mstw2008 . in the lower of fig .",

    "the @xmath20 values are larger but similar between the different pdf groups , and at the very most there is @xmath67 variation in @xmath20 value between different eigenvectors , and in most cases much less . in fig .",

    "similarly the mstw2008cp and mstw2008cpdeut sets give a @xmath20 within a couple of units of mstw2008 for both values of @xmath167 .",
    "future data based on higher luminosity , and with a better determination of systematic uncertainties , will be more constraining and discriminating .",
    "we have repeated the study of extending the parameterisation in the valence and sea quarks , and of investigating deuteron corrections , using nnlo pdfs extracted from an nnlo fit to data .",
    "we do not go into details here as all the conclusions are qualitatively similar .",
    "the input pdfs at nnlo are not exactly the same shape as at nlo due to higher - order corrections , mainly in the coefficient functions . however , as we will discuss , the relative change in the pdfs from the extended parameterisation and deuteron corrections is altered rather little by this .",
    "to be a little more precise , the extended parameterisation leads to an nnlo fit with @xmath168 compared to the standard nnlo fit , in comparison to @xmath169 for the nlo fit .",
    "the changes in pdfs are completely analogous , i.e.  the @xmath96 distribution increases for @xmath170 and decreases at very small @xmath1 , but there is little change in other pdfs . despite the slightly larger fit improvement at nnlo , the change in @xmath96 is slightly smaller than at nlo . when deuteron corrections are allowed to be free they choose a form very similar to the nlo case , though with the normalisation marginally smaller than 1 and the precise value changing slightly if the pivot point @xmath131 is varied .",
    "if @xmath171 is used instead of @xmath135 the fit is only three units worse , but the deuteron correction is very similar to that at nlo , with normalisation marginally above 1 .",
    "the fit has @xmath172 compared to our default fit , similar to the value of @xmath173 at nlo .",
    "as at nlo the only additional change in pdfs is another slight change in @xmath96 and a similar change in @xmath174 to that at nlo .",
    "again the changes are qualitatively the same to those at nlo , but slightly smaller . the changes to predicted cross sections ( such as those shown in table [ tab : sigma ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmacpdeut ] ) using the modified nnlo pdfs are very similar to those at nlo , perhaps a little smaller in general , and as at nlo are much smaller than the pdf uncertainties .",
    "the changes in the modified nnlo pdfs automatically significantly improve the deficiencies that mstw2008 pdfs have with the lhc asymmetry .",
    "the effect from the pdfs is a little less than at nlo due to the smaller change .",
    "however , this is well within uncertainties , and is , for example , no longer true for the @xmath171 fit mentioned above .",
    "( similarly the agreement of the small-@xmath1 powers @xmath34 for the up and down valence distribution are in better agreement for @xmath171  the values of @xmath34 being very sensitive to small changes in detail . )",
    "we also note that the nnlo cross section corrections themselves automatically improve the description of data very slightly . as at nlo , the best fit to the total @xmath160 rapidity data can still be improved , and at nnlo the fit to the general shape in rapidity is a little worse than at nlo .",
    "while the modified pdfs essentially cure the problem with the asymmetry , detailed changes in the gluon and sea are required for the best possible fit as shown by the reweighting exercise at nlo described above .",
    "in this paper we have performed global pdf analyses in which the standard mstw input parameterisations of the pdfs have been made more flexible by replacing the usual @xmath0 factors in the valence , sea and gluon distributions by chebyshev polynomial forms @xmath175 , with @xmath54 .",
    "a chebyshev form has the advantage that the parameters @xmath59 are well - behaved and , compared to the coefficients in our standard parameterisation , are rather small , with moduli usually @xmath176 .",
    "we demonstrated that about four chebyshev polynomials are sufficient for high precision and used this number in the valence and sea distributions .",
    "however , the gluon distribution , which already had seven parameters , did not require extra free parameters .",
    "hence , only two chebyshev polynomials were used in this case , which is equivalent to the usual @xmath0 factor .    to explore the effects of using these more flexible input forms we fit to exactly the same data set as was used for the mstw2008 analysis @xcite .",
    "the resulting parton set was called mstw2008cp .",
    "we found some improvement in the fit to the data , but the only significant pdf change was in the valence up - quark distribution , @xmath2 , at small @xmath1 .",
    "although left free in the fit , the change in @xmath106 is tiny .",
    "the use of chebyshev forms allows a more consistent determination of the uncertainties of the pdfs . in our best fit",
    "we have 6 more free parameters than in the original mstw2008 fit . in the determination of the uncertainties we allow one extra parameter to be free for the @xmath177 and sea quark pdfs when evaluating the uncertainty eigenvectors .",
    "hence , in the determination of the uncertainties of the mstw2008cp pdfs we have 23 eigenvectors , rather than the 20 eigenvectors of the mstw2008 analysis . despite having extra eigenvectors ,",
    "the uncertainties were found to be similar to those of the mstw2008 partons , but tend to be larger , particularly for valence quarks , at small @xmath1 .",
    "the most significant change is in @xmath2 which now has a more realistic uncertainty , without the artificial ` neck ' for @xmath178 at @xmath98 .",
    "we also performed a detailed investigation of the nonperturbative corrections to be applied when fitting to the data obtained from deuteron targets .",
    "it will be important to continue to include these deuteron data in global pdf analyses for the relatively short term , in order to separate the @xmath2 and @xmath3 pdfs .",
    "the deuteron correction factor was parametrised in terms of 4 variables , and various mstw2008cp global fits were performed allowing some , or all , of these variables to be free .",
    "we found that large improvements could be obtained in the description of the deuteron data , and also in the tevatron charged lepton asymmetry data , as compared to the mstw2008 analysis .",
    "the mstw2008 fit had a fixed deuteron correction imposed , and then only at small @xmath1 . using the results from the present study , we have adopted the best , and most realistic , deuteron correction .",
    "the corresponding parton set is called mstw2008cpdeut .",
    "the most significant change , in comparison to mstw2008cp , is in the @xmath3 pdf , and in the uncertainties of both valence pdfs . again",
    "the change in @xmath106 is insignificant .    in summary , the main changes to the mstw2008 pdfs obtained in the cp and cpdeut `",
    "chebyshev ' fits are in @xmath2 and @xmath3 for @xmath179 at high @xmath22 , or slightly higher @xmath1 at low @xmath23 : a region where there are few or weak constraints on the valence pdfs from the data used in these fits .",
    "there is also an approximately 5@xmath81 increase in @xmath3 for @xmath124 in the cpdeut fit .",
    "we have drawn attention to one type of measurement that is particularly sensitive to @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the small @xmath1 region .",
    "that is the decay charged lepton asymmetry from @xmath4 production , which probes a little more deeply into the small @xmath1 region as the collider energy is increased . for a 7 tev collider ,",
    "the probed region is @xmath180 .",
    "the pdf combination sampled by the asymmetry is ( @xmath6 ) at low lepton rapidities .",
    "however , we showed that the description of the asymmetry data has a more intricate dependence on the pdfs at larger rapidities , and also depends sensitively on the experimental minimum @xmath5 cut applied to the observed lepton . in fig .",
    "[ fig : uvminusdv ] we plotted ( @xmath6 ) at the scale @xmath181 approximately relevant for @xmath160 production , obtained from the original mstw2008 analysis together with the behaviour coming from the cp and cpdeut pdf sets ; all three sets were fitted to exactly the same ( pre - lhc ) data .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : atlascomp ] and [ fig : cms35comp ] we showed the predictions for the atlas and cms asymmetry measurements obtained from the three sets of pdfs .",
    "it is remarkable that the ` chebyshev ' sets , and , in particular the mstw2008cpdeut set , give such excellent descriptions of these data , which were not well predicted at low rapidities by the original mstw2008 set .",
    "note that the improvement is due to using a more flexible and more physically suitable ( ` chebyshev ' ) parameterisation of the input pdfs , and to a lesser extent , to taking more care with the deuteron corrections .",
    "we emphasise again that the main changes to the mstw2008 pdfs are in the valence distributions in the small @xmath1 region which is barely probed by the existing data .",
    "lepton asymmetry at higher lhc energies will sample this region more and at smaller @xmath1 values .",
    "it is not surprising , therefore , that we found that the predictions of the original mstw2008 pdfs are essentially unchanged for all other observables . in all the cases that we investigated ,",
    "the changes in the cross sections , compared to those of mstw2008 , were much smaller than the pdf uncertainties .",
    "this was even the case for the total @xmath182 ratio , since each cross section only obtains a small contribution from the high-@xmath5 cut , low-@xmath183 region , and moreover the change in the pdfs does not even change the individual differential cross sections by very much , but in a manner which is maximised in the asymmetry measurement .",
    "hence , for the overwhelming majority of processes at the lhc the mstw2008 pdfs give essentially the same result as those resulting from the investigations in this article .    from the results of this paper",
    "it is clear that a full update of mstw2008 pdfs would benefit from an extended parameterisation similar to the form presented , and a modification of the deuteron corrections of some sort , together with some account of the uncertainty associated with these .",
    "moreover , it would require other features , most particularly an inclusion of new data , including the lhc data considered in this article .",
    "however , from the preliminary studies already undertaken of including new data in @xcite and in this article , it is clear that the effects of individual improvements considered so far give no signs of very significant changes ( and no obvious signs of accumulation of changes from individual improvements ) other than the form of the valence quarks at small @xmath1 .",
    "however , the precise results of a full update await a much more extensive study than the more specific one which is the focus of this article .",
    "we would like to thank stefano forte and jon pumplin for discussion on some of the issues in this article .",
    "the work of r.s.t . is supported partly by the london centre for terauniverse studies ( lcts ) , using funding from the european research council via the advanced investigator grant 267352 .",
