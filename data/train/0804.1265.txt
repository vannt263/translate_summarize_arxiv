    "the running of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the coming years will shed light on several fundamental problems in the standard model ( sm ) and explore possible new physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "if new physics exists at the tev scale and is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking , it may also be responsible for the origin of neutrino masses .",
    "the latter is a kind of new physics which has been firmly established by a number of neutrino oscillation experiments in the past decade @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is extremely interesting to see whether some deep understanding of the neutrino mass generation and lepton number ( flavor ) violation can be achieved at the energy frontier set by the lhc .    a natural and attractive possibility of generating tiny neutrino masses is to extend the sm by introducing three heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos @xcite and ( or ) one higgs triplet @xcite .",
    "the gauge - invariant lagrangian relevant to lepton masses can then be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the higgs triplet , and @xmath8 is the mass matrix of right - handed majorana neutrinos .",
    "after the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking , one obtains the mass matrices @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) of the neutral components of @xmath14 and @xmath7 , respectively . in the leading - order approximation ,",
    "the effective mass matrix for three light neutrinos is given by @xmath15 .",
    "this is the so - called type - ii seesaw mechanism .",
    "if the higgs triplet @xmath7 is absent , the small mass scale of @xmath16 can be just attributed to the large mass scale of @xmath8 ( type - i seesaw @xcite ) . in the absence of heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos",
    ", the small mass scale of @xmath16 implies that the mass scale of @xmath17 must be equally small ( triplet seesaw @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting case is that both terms of @xmath16 are important and their significant cancellation gives rise to small neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "direct tests of such neutrino mass models can be done at the lhc , provided they work at the tev scale and predict appreciable collider signatures .",
    "the search for the higgs triplet and heavy majorana neutrinos at the tevatron and lhc has recently attracted a lot of attention .",
    "for example , a model - independent analysis has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite to probe the same - sign dilepton events induced by heavy majorana neutrinos via the most promising channel @xmath18 .",
    "these events signify the lepton number violation and serve for a clean collider signature of new physics beyond the sm @xcite . in _",
    "realistic _ type - i seesaw models , however , the observability of @xmath0 requires @xmath19 tev and @xmath20 together with an unnatural cancellation condition @xmath21 @xcite . in a triplet seesaw model ,",
    "the production of the doubly - charged higgs bosons @xmath5 only depends on their masses and has nothing to do with the yukawa coupling @xmath22 .",
    "it is therefore possible to discover @xmath5 of @xmath23 tev at the lhc by detecting @xmath24 decays @xcite .",
    "different from those previous works , this paper aims to investigate possible correlation between the collider signatures of heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath0 and doubly - charged higgs bosons @xmath5 in a class of realistic type - ii seesaw models , in which the smallness of @xmath16 is ascribed to a significant but incomplete cancellation between large @xmath25 and @xmath26 terms .",
    "we shall see that the phenomenology of such a type - ii seesaw model is much richer than that of a type - i seesaw model or a triplet seesaw model at the tev scale .",
    "in particular , the non - unitarity of the light neutrino mixing matrix can be closely related to the lepton - number - violating signals of both @xmath0 and @xmath5 at the lhc .",
    "taking the minimal version of the type - ii seesaw models ( with only one heavy majorana neutrino @xmath4 in addition to the higgs triplet @xmath7 ) for example , we calculate the cross sections of @xmath27 mediated separately by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and illustrate their nontrivial correlation at the lhc .",
    "we arrive at some interesting and encouraging conclusions .",
    "if an @xmath28 higgs triplet is introduced into the sm @xcite , the gauge - invariant potential can be written as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the sm higgs doublet , and @xmath32 \\ ; %      ( 2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath7 being defined as @xmath33 when the neutral components of @xmath14 and @xmath7 acquire their vev s @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , the electroweak gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the minimum of @xmath36 can be achieved at @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where the dimensionless parameter @xmath39 has been assumed to be real .",
    "note that @xmath35 may affect the masses of @xmath40 and @xmath41 in such a way that @xmath42 holds . by using current data on the @xmath43-parameter @xcite , we get @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ". there are totally seven physical higgs bosons in this model : doubly - charged @xmath46 and @xmath47 , singly - charged @xmath48 and @xmath49 , neutral @xmath50 ( cp - odd ) , and neutral @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( cp - even ) , where @xmath51 is the sm - like higgs boson . except for @xmath53",
    ", we get a quasi - degenerate mass spectrum for other scalars : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . as a consequence ,",
    "the decay channels @xmath57 and @xmath58 are kinematically forbidden .",
    "the production of @xmath5 at the lhc is mainly through @xmath59 and @xmath60 processes .    on the neutrino side ,",
    "we are left with @xmath25 , @xmath61 and @xmath8 from eq .",
    "( 1 ) after the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "they form a symmetric @xmath62 matrix @xmath63 , which can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation @xmath64 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( for @xmath1 ) being the light and heavy majorana neutrino masses , respectively . in the mass basis , the leptonic charged - current interactions can be written as @xmath70 + { \\rm h.c . } \\ ; .",
    "%      ( 5)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath71 holds due to the unitarity of @xmath72 , and thus the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath73 itself must be non - unitary @xcite .",
    "the unitarity violation of @xmath73 is characterized by @xmath74 , which is responsible for the production and decays of heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath0 . in the leading - order approximation ,",
    "the effective mass matrix of three light neutrinos is given by @xmath15 .",
    "either @xmath25 or @xmath75 may dominate @xmath16 , but here we focus on the third possibility : the smallness of @xmath16 arises from a significant cancellation between @xmath17 and @xmath75 in the case of @xmath76 .",
    "we admit that a substantial fine - tuning at the level of @xmath77 , which is comparable with the degree of fine - tuning for the _ structural cancellation _ of @xmath78 and @xmath8 in the tev - scale type - i seesaw models @xcite , has to be required in order to realize this kind of _ global cancellation_. and @xmath79 hold and thus the cancellation can be achieved with the precision of @xmath80 .",
    "it is possible to realize such a fine cancellation in a more or less natural way by imposing a certain flavor symmetry on @xmath25 , @xmath78 and @xmath8 and introducing slight perturbations to them @xcite . in doing so , however ,",
    "one has to be very cautious and should take into account the effects of radiative corrections to two mass terms @xcite .",
    "] let us reiterate the key points of our model in the following :    * we assume that both @xmath69 and @xmath81 are of @xmath82 tev .",
    "then the production of @xmath5 at the lhc is guaranteed , and their lepton - number - violating signatures will probe the higgs triplet sector of the type - ii seesaw mechanism . on the other hand , @xmath83 is possible as a result of @xmath84 tev and @xmath85 , such that appreciable signatures of @xmath0 can be achieved at the lhc . *",
    "the small mass scale of @xmath16 implies that the relation @xmath86 must hold . in other words , it is the significant but incomplete cancellation between @xmath25 and @xmath87 terms that results in the non - vanishing but tiny masses for three light neutrinos .",
    "can be expressed as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is numerically expected in our model .",
    "( 6 ) is a good approximation irrelevant to small radiative corrections . although the magnitude of @xmath90 is likely to be much larger than that of @xmath68 ( e.g. , of @xmath91 ) , it can in principle be suppressed via a kind of more subtle cancellation which may be accomplished by a slight modification of the relevant yukawa couplings .",
    "a detailed analysis of radiative corrections to @xmath16 in the tev - scale type - ii seesaw model will be presented elsewhere . ]    in this spirit , @xmath25 can be reconstructed via the excellent approximation @xmath92 .",
    "the elements of the yukawa coupling matrix @xmath22 are then given by @xmath93 where the subscripts @xmath94 and @xmath95 run over @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "this result implies that the leptonic decays of @xmath99 depend on both @xmath74 and @xmath69 , which actually determine the production and decays of @xmath0 .",
    "thus we have established an interesting correlation between the doubly - charged higgs bosons and the heavy majorana neutrinos . to observe the correlative signatures of @xmath5 and @xmath0 at the lhc",
    "will serve for a direct test of our type - ii seesaw model .",
    "we shall subsequently consider the minimal version of the type - ii seesaw models @xcite , in which there is only one heavy majorana neutrino @xmath4 together with the higgs triplet @xmath7 , to illustrate how the collider signatures of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are correlated with each other .",
    "in this simple but instructive case , the decay rates of @xmath5 are given by @xmath100 which depend on @xmath101 and @xmath74 in a very obvious way .",
    "since @xmath74 determines both the strength of non - unitarity of @xmath73 and that of the charged - current interactions of @xmath4 , it bridges a gap between neutrino physics and collider physics .",
    "we first look at the production of @xmath4 from proton - proton collisions at the lhc . the dominant channel is @xmath102 , in which @xmath4 is on - shell produced . given the charged - current interactions in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , the total cross section of this process reads @xmath103 where @xmath104 and the narrow - width approximation has been used . note that the reduced cross section @xmath105 is independent of any elements of @xmath74 , and thus it can be computed by taking account of the parton distribution functions and the mass of @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath4 is much heavier than the gauge bosons and the sm - like higgs boson , we have @xmath106 to a very good degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "that is why there appears a factor @xmath107 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "we proceed to consider the production of @xmath5 and their same - sign dilepton events at the lhc . in the narrow - width approximation",
    ", three relevant cross sections can be factorized as @xmath108 where @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 . the reduced cross sections @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 only depend on @xmath81 and @xmath115 , and they can be calculated in a way similar to the calculation of @xmath105 . to detect the lepton - number - violating signals of @xmath5 , we need to take account of their decay modes .",
    "because of @xmath116 , only two decay modes are kinematically open : @xmath117 and @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "the leptonic channel is expected to be dominant in our type - ii seesaw model , and a detailed analysis of the branching ratios of @xmath5 decays can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to specify the correlation between the signatures of @xmath4 and @xmath2 at the lhc ,",
    "let us parametrize the @xmath119 complex matrix @xmath74 in terms of three rotation angles and three phase angles @xcite : @xmath120 , where @xmath121 and @xmath122 with @xmath123 ( for @xmath124 ) . a global analysis of current neutrino oscillation data and precision electroweak data yields very stringent constraints on the non - unitarity of the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath73 , which are equivalent to the constraints on @xmath74 @xcite : @xmath125 in addition to @xmath126 .",
    "on the other hand , the experimental upper bound on the neutrinoless double - beta decay requires @xmath127 , where both the contributions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 have been taken into account . combining all these constraints",

    "we plot @xmath105 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath151 in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) by allowing @xmath101 and @xmath81 to vary from @xmath152 to @xmath153 . note again that these reduced cross sections are independent of @xmath154 . in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , we also show the required cross sections @xmath136 for one @xmath155 event produced at the lhc with the integrated luminosity of @xmath137 in both the case of heavy majorana neutrino @xmath4 ( dashed line ) and that of doubly - charged higgs boson @xmath46 ( solid line ) .",
    "the cross section @xmath156 is defined as follows @xmath157 where @xmath158 it is obvious that the production rate of @xmath159 is remarkably smaller than those of other processes and can be neglected .",
    "one can find from our results that at the lhc , @xmath2 ( heavy majorana neutrinos ) should be observable with the integrated luminosity of @xmath137 in the @xmath160 channel up to the mass of @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "detailed analysis is not the aim of this paper and can be found in our following work .",
    "furthermore , @xmath112 is larger than @xmath114 , and the ratio of @xmath112 to @xmath114 lies in the range @xmath163 for @xmath164 $ ] , which is consistent with the previous results @xcite .",

    ". the changes of @xmath172 and @xmath173 with @xmath101 are illustrated in fig . 1 ( b ) , where @xmath174 and @xmath175 have typically been input .",
    "finally , let us make some brief comments on the type - ii seesaw models with two or three heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "if the masses of @xmath0 are nearly degenerate , their production cross sections will be modified due to either constructive or destructive interference between different contributions . in particular , the cp - violating phases of @xmath74 will enter the expressions of @xmath176 and influence the lepton - number - violating signatures of the doubly - charged higgs bosons at the lhc .",
    "because a generic type - ii seesaw model contains many more free parameters even in the case of @xmath177 , the study of its collider signatures will involve much more uncertainties .",
    "such an analysis , which is important but beyond the scope of this paper , will be done elsewhere @xcite .",
    "motivated by the conjecture that new physics at the tev scale might not only solve the naturalness problem of electroweak symmetry breaking but also be responsible for the lepton number ( flavor ) violation , we have explored an intriguing possibility to test the type - ii seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass generation at the lhc .",
    "our key point is that the mass scales of the @xmath28 higgs triplet and heavy majorana neutrinos are both of @xmath178 tev , and the smallness of @xmath15 is attributed to a significant cancellation between its @xmath25 and @xmath26 terms .",
    "this observation allows us to establish an interesting correlation between the lepton - number - violating signatures of heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath0 and doubly - charged higgs bosons @xmath2 , but it has nothing to do with the mass spectrum of three light neutrinos ( either a normal hierarchy or an inverted hierarchy ) . taking the minimal version of the type - ii seesaw models for example , we have calculated the cross sections of @xmath3 mediated separately by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and illustrated their nontrivial correlation at the lhc .",
    "our results are quite encouraging , and our analysis can easily be extended to the more general cases of this class of tev - scale type - ii seesaw models .",
    "we stress that it is extremely important to search for the correlative collider signatures of @xmath0 and @xmath5 , so as to convincingly and unambiguously verify the type - ii seesaw mechanism .",
    "in contrast , individual signatures of @xmath0 or @xmath5 are only possible to demonstrate the type - i or triplet seesaw mechanism .",
    "we also stress that the non - unitarity of the @xmath179 neutrino mixing matrix is intimately correlated with the lhc signatures of @xmath0 .",
    "this kind of correlation , which bridges a gap between neutrino physics at low energies and collider physics at the tev scale , deserves a lot of further investigation .",
