    "is a _ trap _ of the landscape if @xmath6 is a local but not a global maximum .",
    "control landscapes for closed quantum systems were studied in  @xcite , where the absence of traps was shown under some assumptions .",
    "the analysis for open quantum systems was performed in  @xcite and later was extended to a unified analysis of control landscapes for open classical and quantum systems  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider critical points for control objectives of the form @xmath7\\ ] ] for a 3-level @xmath0-system isolated from the environment .",
    "such objectives describe a wide variety of quantum control phenomena , e.g. , breaking a desired chemical bond , producing selective atomic and molecular excitations , etc . here",
    "@xmath8 is the initial system state which is assumed to be pure , @xmath9 is the target observable , and @xmath10 is the evolution operator describing the evolution of the system from the initial time @xmath11 to the final time @xmath12 under the action of coherent control field @xmath4 .",
    "the evolution operator satisfies the equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the free system hamiltonian and @xmath15 is the operator describing coupling of the system to the control field .    a control field @xmath6 is a _",
    "second order trap _ for the objective functional @xmath5 if the gradient @xmath16 and the hessian @xmath17 is negative semi - definite but @xmath5 is not a global maximum .",
    "more generally , a control field @xmath6 is an _",

    "( here @xmath18 is an even natural number ) if it is not a global maximum and @xmath19 , where the functional @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "various algorithms have been used to find optimal controls in quantum systems including gradient search , e.g. grape  @xcite and its modifications for rapidly time - varying hamiltonians  @xcite , krotov - type methods  @xcite , the broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno ( bgfs ) algorithm and its modifications  @xcite , genetic algorithms and evolutionary strategies  @xcite , and combined approaches  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the existence or absence of traps , including @xmath18-order traps , is important for determining proper algorithms for finding optimal control fields . in the absence of traps , local ( e.g. , gradient ) search",
    "should generally be able to find globally optimal controls ( exceptions may occur if the initial control for a gradient - based search is chosen exactly at a saddle point , where the gradient of the objective is zero ) .",
    "if the landscape has second order or @xmath18-order traps then , since the gradient of the objective at a critical point is zero and in addition , at second - order or @xmath18-order traps the hessian is negative semi - definite , the objective in their vicinity may grow not faster than at a third order in the small variation @xmath23 of the control .",
    "therefore the search for globally optimal controls with simple gradient methods would be problematic in a vicinity of second - order or @xmath18-order traps , where more sophisticated algorithms exploiting the higher order information about the objective are necessary to efficiently climb up the control landscape .",
    "second order traps were shown to exist for a general class of quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "the simplest example is a three - level @xmath0-system , where zero control field was shown to be a second order trap . in this work",
    "we continue the analysis of  @xcite and show that this second order trap is not a local maximum ; there exist a direction in which the objective grows .",
    "we also perform a numerical study of the landscape in a vicinity of the @xmath1 second order trap .",
    "the simplest example where second order traps appear is the following problem : maximizing the expectation of an operator @xmath24 with @xmath25 for a three - level non - degenerate @xmath0-atom which is initially in the ground state @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath15 for @xmath0-atom satisfies @xmath27 , which is consistent with the controllability assumption if @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "note that the pure state controllability for @xmath30-level systems with odd number of levels requires producing the full unitary group @xmath31 , while for @xmath30 even the symplectic group @xmath32 alone is sufficient  @xcite .",
    "the two allowed transition frequencies are @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; non - degeneracy implies that @xmath35 . globally optimal control fields are those which steer @xmath36 completely into @xmath37 producing the global maximum of the objective with the objective value @xmath38 .    without loss of generality we can set @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( replacing @xmath9 by @xmath41 and noticing that linear transformations of the target observable do not affect the properties of critical points ) . since @xmath42 , we can set @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "after these transformations the objective @xmath45 takes the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the transition probability from the state @xmath48 to the state @xmath49 ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) .",
    "the objective takes the values in the interval @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath1 , then the system remains in the ground state and therefore both transition probabilities are zero , @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding objective value @xmath54 is neither a global maximum nor a global minimum .",
    "the control field @xmath1 is a second order trap with the objective value @xmath55 .",
    "more generally , a control @xmath56 is a second order trap if the initial density matrix and target operator have the form @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the basis @xmath59 of the modified hamiltonian @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and the dipole moment satisfies @xmath63 for all @xmath64 .",
    "this important result was proved in  @xcite .",
    "however , previously it was not known if these second order traps are true traps ( local maxima ) .",
    "the following theorem states that it is not the case and there exist local directions in which the objective increases .",
    "the analysis of the general case is equivalent to the case @xmath1 with the modified hamiltonian @xmath65 , therefore only the case @xmath1 will be treated in the rest of the manuscript .",
    "the simplest example of a quantum system possessing a second order trap is a three - level @xmath0-system initially in the ground state .",
    "the control field @xmath1 is a second order trap for maximizing expectation of any target operator of the form @xmath66 with @xmath25 .",

    "such a field does not populate the level @xmath104 in the first order of the perturbation theory ( via one - photon processes ) .",

    "we also observe that if the limiting number of iterations @xmath127 is increased then some runs will be successful even for small @xmath130 .",
    "however , in practice there always exist limits on the number of possible iterations and therefore if a large number of iterations is required to reach a desired objective value , for practical purposes this may look like a trap .",

    "the three - level @xmath0-system has a forbidden @xmath169 transition and therefore is within this class .",
    "our work however studies a different dependence of the efficiency  on @xmath130 , which is effectively the distance of the initial control from the second order trap .",

    "this work shows that constant controls , which are second order traps in the control landscape for a three - level @xmath0-system , are not local maxima : there exists directions around these controls in which the objective increases at 4th order .",
    "a numerical investigation shows that indeed the search with simple gradient methods becomes slow in a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath1 .",
    "these results suggest that in the vicinity of second order traps , simple gradient algorithms may not be sufficient , and more sophisticated algorithms that exploit higher order derivative information may be necessary .",
