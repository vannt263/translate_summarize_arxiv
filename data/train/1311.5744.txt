    "van alphen effect by the lifshitz - kosevich theory has made magnetic quantum oscillations ( mqo ) one of the most powerful tools for studying conduction electrons in metals .",
    "this tool has been extensively used not only for exploring conventional metals @xcite but also for gaining a deep insight into electronic systems of more complex materials such as cuprate @xcite and iron - based @xcite high - temperature superconductors , heavy fermion compounds @xcite , and organic charge - transfer salts kart08a .",
    "particularly the latter class of materials has demonstrated the great potential of the de haas ",
    "van alphen ( dhva ) and shubnikov  de haas ( sdh ) effects in revealing the fermi surface properties in various electronic states .",
    "additionally , the organic compounds , generally characterized by an extraordinary crystal quality , very high anisotropy , and significant electron interactions , offer a vast playground for studying specific features of mqo in layered correlated electron systems , see for a review refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "a spectacular example of how mqo and high - field classical magnetoresistance can be used for investigating the electronic state of an organic metal is the work done on @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1mhg(xcn)@xmath2 , where bedt - ttf stands for the donor organic molecule bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene , m= k , tl , nh@xmath2 , and rb , and x= s , se , see @xcite for a review .",
    "these are isostructural layered charge - transfer salts with the fermi surface comprising a pair of slightly warped open sheets ( representing a quasi - one - dimensional , q1d , conduction band ) and a cylinder ( a quasi - two - dimensional , q2d , band ) @xcite .",
    "the compounds display a huge electronic anisotropy : the ratio of the effective transfer integrals within and across conducting layers @xmath3 is in the range @xmath4 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the mqo have a very large amplitude and bear a pronounced 2d character @xcite .",
    "the monotonic part of the interlayer magnetoresistance also shows severe deviations from the conventional three - dimensional behavior @xcite .    at temperature @xmath5k three salts , with m= k , tl , and rb , and x= s undergo a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) transition caused by the peierls - type nesting instability of the open fermi sheets @xcite .",
    "the compounds remain , however , metallic due to the ungapped cylindrical fermi surface .",
    "the low - temperature state is characterized by a bunch of striking anomalies in high magnetic fields which , actually , have triggered the initial interest in these materials osad90,sasa90a , kart92b , kart93,caul95 . by now , it is clear that their behavior is largely governed by the coexistence of a narrow - gap cdw and metallic q2d carriers and , consequently , a rich phase diagram including several kinds of magnetic field - induced transitions between different cdw states , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , a number of anomalies are still a matter of debate .",
    "one of the problems in this respect is that there is no general consensus as to the exact topology of the reconstructed fermi surface in the cdw state kart93,harr99a , harr04,kang13 .",
    "moreover , even the occurrence of reconstruction itself has been questioned @xcite .",
    "here we report on experimental studies of magnetic quantum oscillations in the cdw state of @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1mhg(scn)@xmath2  with m= k and tl .",
    "in addition to the dominant frequency corresponding to the large cylindrical fermi surface predicted by the normal - state band structure calculations @xcite , a new , low frequency is found in both the sdh and dhva spectra .",
    "this result is discussed in terms of the fermi surface reconstruction in the cdw state .",
    "further , the phase of the sdh ( but not dhva ! ) oscillations in the low - temperature , low - field cdw state is shown to be inverted in comparison to that in the normal state .",
    "we propose a model that qualitatively explains this anomalous behavior via spatial fluctuations of the magnetic breakdown gap .",
    "the experiments were carried out on single crystals of @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1khg(scn)@xmath2  and @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1tlhg(scn)@xmath2  hereafter referred to as the k - salt and tl - salt , respectively .",
    "the samples were submillimeter - size platelets of a distorted hexagon shape with large faces parallel to the highly conducting bedt - ttf layers . for ambient - pressure studies a setup allowing simultaneous measurements of the",
    "interlayer magnetoresistance and magnetic torque @xcite was used .",
    "high - pressure magnetoresistance experiments were done using a small clamp pressure cell made of nonmagnetic cu - be alloy .",
    "the pressure was applied at room temperature and its low-@xmath6 value was determined from the resistance of a calibrated manganin pressure gauge .",
    "the oscillations of magnetoresistance and magnetic torque were studied in the temperature range from 0.4 to 4.2k .",
    "magnetic fields up to 17 t were generated by a superconducting solenoid .",
    "experiments at higher fields , up to 29 t were conducted at the laboratoire national des champs magntiques intenses ( lncmi ) , grenoble , france .",
    "the magnetoresistance and magnetization of the @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1mhg(scn)@xmath2  salts in the cdw state were studied by many authors , see @xcite and references therein . the general behavior in a field nearly perpendicular to conducting bedt - ttf layers is illustrated in fig .  [ restorq ] .",
    "below the so - called kink field , @xmath8 and 27 t for the k- and tl - salts , respectively @xcite , the zero - field cdw@xmath7 state is stable . as seen from fig.[restorq ] , it is characterized by a very high interlayer magnetoresistance showing a peak at around 10 t and then gradually turning down .",
    "the mqo in the cdw@xmath7 state are moderately strong , of the order of a few percent of the total signal , and have a distorted or even split shape due to an anomalously strong second harmonic contribution . at @xmath9",

    "the original fermi surface ( left panel ) consists of a pair of open sheets and a cylinder .",
    "the cdw , introducing a new periodicity with the wave vector @xmath20 , opens a gap at the fermi level in the whole open branch as well as in the q2d band at the states separated by @xmath20 ( right panel).,width=302 ]    in addition to @xmath21 and its higher harmonics , a low frequency peak at @xmath17 t is clearly pronounced in the fft spectra .",
    "it is important that the low frequency is observed not only in magnetoresistance but also in magnetization .",
    "the latter establishes its thermodynamic origin , ruling out kinetic effects like quantum interference of open electron trajectories @xcite or due to a weak warping of the fermi cylinder @xcite which are often found in layered organic metals kart04,kart05 .",
    "we , therefore , attribute it to a real closed orbit on a small cylindrical fermi surface undergoing landau quantization in a strong magnetic field .",
    "the present result provides a solid argument in favor of the fermi surface reconstruction model based on studies of the semiclassical angle - dependent magnetoresistance oscillations ( amro ) @xcite .",
    "according to this model , the cdw potential @xmath22 with the wave vector @xmath20 , besides nesting the open sheets of the original fermi surface , sketched in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ lambda](c ) , also has an effect on the q2d band .",
    "it folds the cylindrical part of the fermi surface , mixing the states with the wave vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this creates a new small cylinder and a pair of strongly corrugated sheets extending along @xmath20 , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ lambda](c ) .",
    "the open sheets are responsible for the amro with sharp dips at the so - called lebed magic angles @xcite .",
    "the small cylindrical fermi surface is manifested through the low - frequency mqo , @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath0-oscillations come as a result of magnetic breakdown ( mb ) .",
    "the energy scale of the gap @xmath26 separating the open and closed parts of the fermi surface is of the order of the cdw potential , which can be assessed from the critical field of the low - temperature cdw@xmath7-cdw@xmath10 phase transition , @xmath27 buzd83c , zanc96,grig05 . for the k - salt , @xmath28 t , yielding @xmath29mev .",
    "then , using the blount criterion for mb @xcite , one can obtain an estimate of the breakdown field , @xmath30 t , where @xmath31mev and @xmath32 are , respectively , the fermi energy and effective cyclotron mass evaluated from the mqo data and @xmath33 is the elementary charge .    at fields @xmath34 t ,",
    "at which the mqo just become resolvable , the amplitudes of the @xmath18- and @xmath0-oscillations coming from the classical and magnetic - breakdown orbits , respectively , are comparable . as the field increases further , the breakdown probability grows exponentially .",
    "this leads to a rapid enhancement of the @xmath0-oscillations by contrast to the almost constant amplitude of the @xmath18-oscillations , c.f .",
    "blue and red lines in fig .",
    "[ lambda](a),(b ) . above 17 t",
    "the relative contribution of the @xmath18-frequency to the mqo spectrum becomes vanishingly small due to the strong magnetic breakdown .",
    "the latter is also reflected in the negative slope of the magnetoresistance , see fig .",
    "[ restorq ] , as well as in the behavior of the amro @xcite . as the system enters the cdw@xmath10 state at @xmath35 , the cdw gap",
    "is considerably reduced @xcite .",
    "the probability of magnetic breakdown increases to almost unity ; both the mqo and classical magnetoresistance are fully determined by the breakdown orbit @xmath0 , as if the cylindrical fermi surface were unreconstructed .",
    "in particular , this is a reason why the high - field cdw@xmath10 state was for some time confused with a reentrant normal state @xcite .    besides the frequencies @xmath21 and @xmath25 , their linear combinations have been observed in some experiments kart93,caul95,hous96b , which is consistent with the proposed model of the fermi surface reconstruction .",
    "an additional frequency of 775 t has been reported once for the k - salt that would be difficult to account for . however , to the best of our knowledge , it has not been reproduced by other authors .",
    "it should be noted that there is still no simple explanation of the anomalously strong second harmonic of @xmath21 observed in the cdw@xmath7 state at field orientations nearly normal to the layers . in spite of several attempts to explain them @xcite",
    ", this puzzle is still awaiting a convincing solution .",
    "there is a notable difference in the behavior of the dhva and sdh signals in fig .",
    "[ restorq ] .",
    "while the magnetization displays regular oscillations continuously growing with field , the sdh signal has a node - like feature at 26  t , i.e. shortly after entering the cdw@xmath36 state . the phase of the sdh oscillations inverts at the node . on the high - field side",
    "the positions of the resistance peaks coincide with the midpoints of the decaying half - periods of the magnetization oscillations corresponding to the integer filling factors ( the chemical potential resides in the middle between the adjacent landau levels ) .",
    "this is exactly what is expected of the interlayer magnetoresistance oscillations in the bulk q2d regime , when the landau level ( ll ) spacing @xmath37 exceeds the interlayer bandwidth @xmath38 @xcite . at first glance",
    ", the inverted phase of the sdh oscillations below the node - like feature might be attributed to a dimensional crossover from the high - field q2d regime to a more conventional 3d one , where the resistance should peak at odd - half - integer filling @xcite .",
    "this , however , is hardly the case : due to a very weak interlayer coupling , the dimensional crossover in the present materials takes place already at 12  t @xcite .",
    "therefore , the oscillation phase below the node should be considered as anomalous .",
    "kbar plotted in the @xmath39 scale , for different temperatures .",
    "the vertical solid ( dashed ) grid lines correspond to the integer ( odd half - integer ) filling factors , see text .",
    "the hatched boxes indicate the regions where the oscillation phase changes by @xmath40 .",
    "( b ) the @xmath41 phase diagram ( filled and empty blue circles ) , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , and the phase inversion points ( red stars ) determined from the data in ( a).,width=302 ]    at ambient pressure , the phase inversion occurs only in the cdw@xmath10 state , above 24 t that makes it rather difficult to trace in steady magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , we have performed magnetoresistance measurements under pressure which is known to shift the cdw phase boundaries to lower fields and temperatures @xcite .",
    "the results of the experiment on the k - salt under a pressure of 1.8kbar , in the field perpendicular to the layers are summarized in fig .",
    "[ khgpress ] . in panel",
    "( a ) the sdh oscillations , obtained by subtracting a low - order polynomial from the as - measured interlayer resistance , are plotted as a function of inverse field for different temperatures .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) grid lines are drawn through the maxima ( minima ) of the resistance at 4.2k .",
    "the lower - temperature curves show an inversion of the oscillation phase within narrow field intervals marked by hatched boxes . following the results of the ambient pressure experiment",
    ", we conclude that also under pressure the sdh phase is `` correct '' ( resistance maxima at integer filling factors ) at high fields and anomalous at lower fields .",
    "note that the field @xmath42 , at which the phase inversion occurs , rapidly increases at lowering the temperature .",
    "this obviously is reflected in the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude , leading to drastic deviations from the conventional lifshitz - kosevich behavior @xcite .",
    "indeed , according to the data in fig .",
    "[ khgpress](a ) , the @xmath6-dependence of the sdh amplitude measured at around 28 t ( @xmath43 ) reaches its maximum at 2.6k and nearly vanishes at 1.4k ; at fields 25 - 26 t the amplitude has a minimum near 2k .",
    "therefore , one has to be extremely careful when trying to analyze the @xmath6-dependence of the sdh amplitude in the present system in terms of the lifshitz - kosevich theory .",
    "the temperature - dependent field @xmath42 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ khgpress](b ) ( stars ) on top of the phase diagram of the k - salt at 1.8kbar ( circles ) . for @xmath44k",
    "no phase inversion was detected down to 15 t , the lowest field at which the oscillations could still be resolved ; therefore , the point at 4.2k only indicates the upper limit for @xmath42 . from this plot",
    "it becomes clear that the anomalous sdh phase exists only in the cdw state , at temperatures and fields sufficiently distant from the boundary to the normal state .    to verify that the anomalous sdh phase is a general property of the cdw state of @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1mhg(scn)@xmath2  and not just a feature of the k - salt",
    ", we made similar measurements on the tl - salt under a pressure of 2.6kbar .",
    "[ tlhgpress ] shows the oscillating component of magnetoresistance in the inverse - field scale .",
    "while no perfect nodes are observed in this case , the oscillations clearly invert their phase upon changing field and temperature .",
    "note that the data in fig .",
    "[ tlhgpress ] correspond to the field range below 15.5 t which is significantly below the cdw@xmath7 ",
    "cdw@xmath10 transition .",
    "thus , the phase inversion in the field sweeps occurs deep inside the cdw@xmath7 phase for temperatures above 1.5k .",
    "kbar.,width=302 ]    the inversion of the sdh signal in the @xmath0(bedt - ttf)@xmath1mhg(scn)@xmath2compounds has already been reported by a number of authors hill97a , hono00,harr00,andr01a , uji08 .",
    "most of these experiments were focused on the high - field state , above the kink field @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , all the proposed explanations , involving various exotic phenomena such as bulk quantum hall effect @xcite , froehlich superconductivity @xcite , or an unconventional quantum liquid @xcite , associated the anomalous phase with the high - field cdw@xmath10 or even normal state .",
    "they all implied a normal behavior to be restored at lower fields as the system enters the cdw@xmath7 state and/or the oscillations become weak .",
    "this obviously contradicts the present results showing that the anomalous phase does exist in the cdw@xmath7 state .",
    "moreover , no re - entrance to the normal phase is observed at lowering the field as long as the oscillations can be resolved .",
    "therefore , the mechanism responsible for the phase inversion should be based on a property common for the cdw@xmath7 and cdw@xmath10 states .",
    "a possible candidate is magnetic breakdown between the open and closed parts of the q2d fermi surface .",
    "below we propose a model , illustrating how magnetic breakdown may lead to the phase inversion of the sdh signal in a system with spatial fluctuations of the breakdown gap , and argue that it is qualitatively consistent with the present experiment .",
    "the observed magnetoresistance is due to two subsets of electron orbits in the momentum space .",
    "the first one appears due to mb and corresponds to the closed electron trajectory along the @xmath45-pockets of the fermi surface , see fig .",
    "[ lambda](c ) .",
    "this orbit is responsible for the quantum oscillations with the frequency @xmath46 and would be the only one observed for the breakdown amplitude @xmath47 .",
    "the second subset includes all other trajectories on the reconstructed fermi surface : open trajectories on the strongly corrugated open sheets , closed orbits on the very small fs cylinders , yielding the mqo frequency @xmath48 , as well as a variety of other mb orbits , which do not contribute to the @xmath45-frequency of mqo . the main contribution to the electron density of states ( dos ) of the second subset comes from the states on the open non - quantized orbits .",
    "hereafter we refer to this second subset as to the open or q1d branch , whereas the first subset , producing the @xmath45-frequency , we call the q2d branch . at a finite mb amplitude",
    "both branches are present . to encircle the @xmath45-orbit , electrons must undergo four mb transitions , see fig .",
    "[ lambda](c ) .",
    "therefore , the amplitude to complete the @xmath45-orbit is @xmath49 @xcite , where @xmath50 is mb amplitude and @xmath51 is the dingle factor coming from the electron scattering on short - range defects @xcite ; in clean samples @xmath51 is close to unity .",
    "hence , in analogy to the case of mqo in the regime of a finite mb amplitude @xmath50 @xcite , we may very roughly evaluate the density of q2d electron states as @xmath52 , and the density of the q1d states as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the total dos @xcite . in our experiment the mb amplitude at @xmath55  t is close to unity : @xmath56 , using the given above estimate @xmath57 t .",
    "however , the relative weight of the q1d states is still comparable to that of q2d states : @xmath58 .",
    "the significant contribution from the q1d states is manifested , for instance , in the amro behavior .",
    "the mb with a finite amplitude induces transitions between these two branches : from the q1d to the q2d branch with the amplitude @xmath50 and probability @xmath59 , and to the q1d branch with the amplitude @xmath60 and probability @xmath61 . for an ideal crystal ,",
    "the mb amplitude does not depend on coordinates .",
    "however , in various organic metals the cdw order parameter is subject to spatial fluctuations , as in the soliton phase of the cdw ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and @xcite for review ) .",
    "these solitons locally reduce the cdw gap value @xmath62 . since the cdw gap defines the mb gap , namely , @xmath63 , the mb amplitude @xmath50 significantly increases in such soliton spots . for simplicity , consider the mb amplitude @xmath64 everywhere except for certain `` mb defect '' spots , where @xmath65 .",
    "this means that the defect spots scatter the electrons to the q2d states .",
    "the scattered electrons change their momentum in the direction perpendicular to the layers ( @xmath66-direction ) because the mb defects are local , which leads to relaxation of the @xmath66-component of electron momentum as if due to impurities .    in spite of an obvious similarity between the mb - defect spots and randomly distributed impurities",
    ", there is an important difference between the two : the latter scatter electrons to any state with the same energy , and in the born approximation the corresponding scattering rate is @xmath67 , where the total dos @xmath68 is the sum of the q1d and the q2d dos : @xmath69 . in our model ,",

    "( [ s1d ] ) simplifies to @xmath78  in very clean samples , @xmath79 , so that the main relaxation of electron momentum arises from the scattering off mb defects : @xmath80 incidentally , the increasing scattering rate in the mb regime may account for the unusually strong magnetoresistance of the present compounds at @xmath81 t , see fig .",

    "( [ taumb])-([tt ] ) we obtain @xmath82 due to the landau quantization , the q2d dos @xmath83 is an oscillating function of @xmath84 around some constant value @xmath85 . for the q1d branch",
    ", there is no ll quantization , and the q1d dos does not oscillate : @xmath86 .",
    "the mean - square velocity on the q2d branch @xmath87 is also an oscillating function of @xmath84 , but the amplitude and even the sign of its oscillations depends on the ratio of @xmath88 , @xmath37 and @xmath89 . in 3d metals with @xmath90",
    "the oscillations of @xmath91 are weak and in the opposite phase to the dos oscillations , which determines the phase of sdh oscillations in 3d metals . in almost 2d metals with @xmath92 but for weak mqo ,",
    "the oscillations of @xmath93 are much weaker than the oscillations of @xmath94 . to show this , consider @xmath95 , where the quantum oscillations of @xmath96 are given by eq.(3 ) of ref .",

    "hence , for @xmath102 at @xmath103 , @xmath104 for strong mqo in almost 2d metals , i.e. when @xmath105 and @xmath92 , the oscillations of @xmath87 can not be neglected and must be calculated beyond the @xmath71-approximation @xcite . in this limit",

    "thus , spatial fluctuations of magnetic breakdown may lead to a phase inversion of the sdh signal in a field sweep . since the mb gap , determined by the cdw potential is small near the cdw  normal - metal boundary ,",
    "the anomalous phase only occurs at certain temperatures well enough below the cdw transition .",
