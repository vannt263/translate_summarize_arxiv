    "the herbig - haro ( hh ) object 30 @xcite , located in the northeastern part of the l1551 dark cloud , lies at a distance of 140 pc @xcite .",
    "the hh 30 outflow is considered a prototypical jet / disk system .",
    "it presents a clear jet / counterjet structure , which has been described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the hh 30 exciting source is an optically invisible star @xcite highly extinguished by an edge - on disk @xcite , which extends up to a radius of @xmath7 au perpendicularly to the jet , and divides the surrounding reflection nebulosity into two lobes .",
    "@xcite propose a spectral type m0 for the hh 30 star , and @xcite estimate a bolometric luminosity of 0.20.9 @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite propose that a number of knots located to the northeast of the hh 30 object are also part of the same flow , resulting in a total angular size of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 pc ) for the whole outflow .",
    "several studies have explored the spatial morphology along and across the jet axis @xcite , the 3-d structure @xcite , line ratios @xcite , or radial velocities @xcite of the hh 30 flow .",
    "in addition , some studies have been carried out studying the variability of the reflection nebulosity around hh 30 .",
    "@xcite find variations of the lateral asymmetry of the nebula and counternebula , but find no convincing evidence for any period .",
    "however , @xcite find a periodic modulation of the polarization of the nebula , with a period of 7.5 days , which is interpreted as produced by asymmetric accretion hot spots on the star , or orbiting clumps or voids in the disk .    proper motions of a few knots of the hh 30 flow were determined by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a thorough study of the proper motions of all the knots of the hh 30 jet and the closest knots of the counterjet was made by @xcite .",
    "the main result of this study is that the overall structure of the hh 30 jet can be well fitted by the shape of a wiggling ballistic jet , arising either by the orbital motion of the jet source or by precession of the jet axis because of the tidal effects of a companion . in the first case",
    "the binary separation is expected to be 918 au , while in the case of precession the binary separation is @xmath11 au .",
    "given that the radius of the flared disk observed in the hst images is 250 au , the conclusion is that this disk appears to be a circumbinary disk rather than a circumstellar disk , contrary to what was initially thought .",
    "this circumbinary disk is unlikely to have a relevant role in the jet collimation .",
    "@xcite carry out pdbi observations of the dust continuum and co line emission revealing the presence of an asymmetric molecular outflow and a disk in keplerian rotation , deriving a central stellar mass of @xmath12 @xmath2 .",
    "more recently , @xcite carry out co and dust continuum observations of the circumbinary disk that reveal an inner cavity with a radius of @xmath13 au , and @xcite , throught a detailed modeling , conclude that the disk has an inner depletion zone with a similar radius os @xmath14 au radius .",
    "@xcite explain the size of the inner hole as a result of tidal forces induced by a binary with a separation of @xmath15 au , supporting the binary interpretation proposed by @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present new [ sii ] images of the hh 30 jet and counterjet carried out in 2006 , 2007 , and 2010 , which allowed us to measure the position and proper motion of the jet and counterjet knots , and to constrain the parameters of the binary system . in ",

    "more details on the acquisition and treatment of the not observations can be found in @xcite .",
    "finally , the 2010 image was obtained at the 4.2  m william herschel telescope ( wht ) , using the acam camera on the cassegrain focus , giving a field of view of @xmath19 with a spatial scale of @xmath20 pixel@xmath21 .",
    "a narrow - band [ sii ] filter , centered on @xmath22    and bandpass @xmath23   was used .",
    "in addition , a frame of a shorter exposure time of 3600 s was acquired through another narrow - band filter , centered on @xmath24   and bandpass @xmath18  .",

    "the images were smoothed with a gaussian with a fwhm of 3 pixels .",
    "the smoothed images were used for the farther away knots of the jet and counterjet ( b to e , and j to n ) , while the full resolution images were used for the stronger , closer to the origin knots ( a and z ) . this nomenclature for the knots",
    "is based on that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "knots z3 to z6 of the counterjet , detected in our 2006 , 2007 , and 2010 observations , have been identified for the first time .",
    "positions of the knots for each epoch were measured with respect to the position of the brightest knot a0 , whose position was set to @xmath210 .",
    "the position of the knots was determined from a parabolic fit to the intensity of the @xmath211 pixels centered on the pixel with peak emission .",
    "then , the proper motion in @xmath209 and @xmath208 directions of each knot , @xmath212 and @xmath213 , was determined from a linear regression fit to their positions in the different epoch images .",
    "the 1993 image has poorer seeing than the others , and could not be used for knots close to the hh 30 star , i.e.  knots a and z. the 1989 and 1999 images do not include the counterjet region for distances greater than @xmath214 , and could not be used neither for the counterjet knots z3 to z6 , nor for j to n. the results are given in tables [ pmjet ] and [ pmcjet ] , and shown in fig .  [ fpmae ] , where the knot positions and proper motions are shown superimposed on the smoothed 2010 image .",
    "the errors assigned to the proper motions , in both @xmath209 and @xmath208 , are the formal errors of the slope of the linear regression fits for each knot .",
    "these errors are shown as ellipses at the end of the arrows shown in fig .",
    "[ fpmae ] .",
    "the errors appear to be rather small as a consequence of the wide span of time used for calculating the proper motions , and that 6 epochs were used for most knots .",
    "the quality of the linear regression fits for each knot is indicated by the small values of the residuals in @xmath209 , @xmath215 , and @xmath208 , @xmath216 , ( see tables [ pmjet ] and [ pmcjet ] ) and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fyae ] , where the measured and fitted values of the @xmath208 position as a function of time for each knot , are shown .",
    "in all the cases , the @xmath208 positions are well fitted by the proper motion velocity obtained , showing that the motion of the knots is ballistic .",
    "all the knots show proper motions roughly in the direction of the jet axis , with the exception of knot j of the counterjet , which has been measured to be nearly stationary .",
    "this knot is located inside a reflection nebulosity southwest of the hh 30 star ( spreading from @xmath217 to @xmath218 ; see fig .",
    "[ fpmae ] ) , and is most probably not a counterjet knot , but a feature of the reflection nebulosity .",
    "we will not consider this knot in the following .",
    "it is worth noting that the proper motions @xmath213 obtained here are significantly lower than those obtained in @xcite from two observations with nearly one year of interval , in 1998 and 1999 . on the average ,",
    "the proper motion velocities for knots a to e of the jet are @xmath219 yr@xmath21 ( or 75 km s@xmath21 ) higher in @xcite than the present values . for the counterjet , the absolute value of the proper motion velocities for knots z1 and z2 are @xmath220 yr@xmath21 ( or 85 km",
    "s@xmath21 ) lower in @xcite than the present values . since",
    "the proper motions are measured with respect to the brightest knot a0 , the discrepancy can be explained by a shift in the position of a0 along the axis of the jet of @xmath221 in the 1999 image with respect to that of 1998 .",
    "such a shift in position can be attributed to the observed variations in the brightness of the diffuse light of the hh 30 star @xcite . however",
    ", this systematic error in the determination of proper motions is not expected to affect measurements that span over a large number of years , like those presented in the present work .    in fig .",
    "[ fvyy ] we plot the proper motion velocity in the @xmath208 direction , in absolute value , @xmath222 , as a function of distance @xmath208 .",
    "as can be seen , the jet and counterjet velocities are quite different . for the jet knots ,",
    "most have velocities @xmath223 km",
    "s@xmath21 , except knots d , with distances from the hh 30 star between @xmath224 and @xmath225 , which have a higher velocity , @xmath226 km s@xmath21 . for the counterjet , the velocities are more irregular .",
    "there are knots with @xmath227 km s@xmath21 ( z4 ) , with @xmath228 km s@xmath21 ( z1 , z3 , z5a , z5b ) , and with @xmath229 km s@xmath21 ( z2 , z6 ) . on the average ,",
    "the proper motion velocity of the jet knots is 115 km s@xmath21 , while for the counterjet knots the average is 193 km s@xmath21 .",
    "the difference is also found in the velocity dispersion , which is 54 km s@xmath21 for the jet , and 82 km s@xmath21 for the counterjet .",
    "thus , the counterjet knots have , on average , higher velocities than the jet knots , and show more variation from knot to knot .",
    "let us now consider the pair of knots of the counterjet z1 and z2 .",
    "the velocity of z2 ( @xmath230 km s@xmath21 ) is much higher than that of z1 ( @xmath231 km s@xmath21 ) . this pair of knots , in spite of being very close to the hh 30 star , have well determined proper motions , since they have been observed at five epochs , spanning 17 years .",
    "in addition , the proper motions obtained by fitting only the new observations in 2006 , 2007 , and 2010 , coincide with those obtained when the old observations of 1998 and 1999 are included in the fit .",
    "the positions of the two knots z1 and z2 , when extrapolated back in time , show that they were launched simultaneously , at the end of 1989 ( see fig .",
    "[ fyae ] ) .",
    "a similar case is found for the pair of knots z5 and z6 of the counterjet , but in this case the proper motion velocities are not so well constrained as in the case of z1 and z2 .",
    "thus , it appears that the counterjet of hh 30 is able to launch simultaneously pairs of knots with very different velocities .",

    "the bending of the hh 30 jet is suggestive of being entrained toward the north - west ( increasing @xmath209 ) .",

    "interestingly , our new observations , covering a longer time span , allowed us to derive more accurate proper motions and reveal that the velocities of the knots are smaller than the values estimated by @xcite .",
    "the new values of the proper motions imply that the wiggling period is about twice the previous value ( 114 yr instead of 53 yr ) , allowing us to discard a significant contribution of precession to the observed wiggling of the jet ( see  [ results ] ) .    thus , based on our new observations",
    "we conclude that the observed shape of the jet is a consequence of the orbital motion of the jet source in a binary system . from our new results , and assuming that the central stellar mass is @xmath474 , as estimated by @xcite from the co kinematics of the disk , we obtain that the binary separation ( i.e.  the radius of the relative orbit ) should be @xmath469 au .",
    "interestingly , @xcite observe a hole of @xmath13 au of radius in the co and dust emission from the disk associated with hh 30 .",
    "these authors interpret this hole as produced by tidal effects in a binary system , inferring a binary separation of @xmath15 au , in excellent agreement with our result .",
    "therefore , these results give strong support to the binary interpretation , and in particular to the orbital motion scenario we proposed for hh 30 .",
    "a binary separation of 18 au corresponds to an angular separation of @xmath220 at a distance of 140 pc .",
    "thus , the proposed binary system associated with the hh 30 jet can be angularly resolved by the new , expanded jansky very large array ( jvla ) and by the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "unfortunately , according to our modeling of the orbital motion , at the current epoch ( @xmath475 ) the two stars are roughly aligned along the line of sight ( @xmath476 ) , resulting in a projected angular separation of @xmath477 , which is too small to be angularly resolved by the currently available instrumentation . we should wait four years until the projected angular separation will reach @xmath478 and the presence of the proposed binary system could be confirmed by a direct observation of a double source and/or to measure orbital proper motions , as has been done previously in other binary young stellar objects ( e.g.  l1551-irs5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    when the hst observations revealed the silhouette of a flared edge - on disk with a radius of @xmath7 au perpendicular to the hh 30 jet , this system was considered the archetype of a jet / circumstellar accretion disk system in a young stellar object . however , the discovery that the central source is in fact a binary , and therefore , that the disk is circumbinary rather than circumstellar , has changed our understanding of this object .",
    "tidal truncation of the disk in a binary system suggests that the radius of the circumstellar disk should be about @xmath479 of the binary separation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we expect that the `` true '' circumstellar accretion disk associated with the driving source of the hh 30 jet must have a radius @xmath480 au . therefore , the search for this circumstellar disk should be carried out at very small scales ( @xmath481 )",
    "another interesting characteristic of the hh 30 system is that the jet and counterjet show clear differences .",
    "the knots of the jet and of the counterjet can not be grouped in pairs with similar separation from the star and similar velocity .",
    "hh 30 seems to be , in this aspect , completely different , for instance , from the jet and counterjet of hh 34 , in which the jet and counterjet show a remarkable symmetry @xcite .",
    "clear jet / counterjet asymmetries in the physical properties have been found in several well studied jets , such as dg tau b @xcite , fs tau b @xcite , dg tau @xcite , or hh 30 itself @xcite . actually , strong velocity asymmetries between the red and blue lobes are frequent .",
    "@xcite note that about half of bipolar jets present a strong asymmetry of about a factor two in velocity between the two lobes .",
    "in hh 30 we found that the average proper motion velocities in the counterjet are a factor of 1.7 higher than in the jet .",
    "we also found a higher velocity dispersion in the counterjet ( see  [ pmotion ] ) . in the frame of stellar wind models , velocity asymmetries between the jet and counterjet",
    "have been attributed to differences in pressure . in the frame of magneto - hydrodynamical disk winds ,",
    "jet asymmetries require an asymmetry in magnetic lever arms or in launch radii between either sides of the disk , a situation that may occur naturally in an asymmetric ambient medium .",
    "for example , if the ambient radiation field is stronger on one side , this can increase the level of ionization on the surface of the disk on that side , leading to enhanced mass load on the magnetic field lines ( smaller magnetic lever arm ) , and/or to a larger jet launching region ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , hh 30 also shows differences in velocity in the same lobe of the outflow . for the jet",
    ", there are at least two velocities , a low velocity of @xmath223 km s@xmath21 for knots a , b , c , and e , and a high velocity of @xmath482 km s@xmath21 for knots d. for the counterjet we find knots close to each other with different velocities , and there are at least three different velocities , a low velocity of @xmath483 km s@xmath21 for knot z4 , a medium velocity of @xmath484 km s@xmath21 for knots z1 , z3 , z5a and z5b , and an extremely - high velocity of @xmath485 km s@xmath21 for knots z2 and z6 ( see  [ pmotion ] ) .",
    "indeed , we found that the knots z1 and z2 ( and perhaps also z5 and z6 ) of the counterjet appear to be launched nearly simultaneously with very different velocities .",
    "these strong differences in velocity for knots located in the same lobe of the outflow can not be attributed only to asymmetries in the ambient medium between the two sides of the disk .",
    "therefore , launching from different radii in an extended disk wind scenario provides the simplest explanation for the different observed velocities . following @xcite , the asymptotic jet velocity as a function of the launch radius in the disk , @xmath486 ,",
    "is expected to be of the order of @xmath487 km s@xmath21 for a value of the magnetic lever arm parameter of @xmath488 ( i.e.   the extended warm disk wind scenario with moderate lever arms  described , e.g.  in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "assuming that the jet source has a mass of @xmath489 @xmath2 ( see above ) , we obtain that a range of launching radii @xmath4900.6 au is required to explain the velocity range of @xmath223300 km s@xmath21 observed in the hh 30 jet / counterjet .",
    "this range of launching radii falls within the range of values determined for t tauri jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , which range from 0.07 au ( the typical disk corotation radius ) up to @xmath491 au .",
    "using data from observations at six different epochs , we have measured the proper motions and studied the morphology of the hh 30 jet / counterjet system .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized in the following .    *",
    "the motion of most knots is essentially ballistic , but the jet / counterjet shows a large scale bending .",
    "this bending can be produced by a relative motion of the hh 30 star with respect to its surrounding environment of @xmath289 km s@xmath21 , caused either by a possible proper motion of the hh 30 star , or by the entraining of environment gas by the red lobe of the nearby l1551-irs 5 outflow .",
    "alternatively , the bending can be produced by the stellar wind from a nearby ctts , identified in the 2mass catalog as j04314418 + 181047 . *",
    "the average velocity of the knots of the jet is about twice than that of the counterjet .",
    "velocity differences are also found in the same outflow lobe .",
    "most of the knots of the jet move at velocities of @xmath223 km s@xmath21 , but several knots ( knots d ) move faster , at @xmath226 km s@xmath21 .",
    "the velocities of the counterjet knots are less ordered , with knots moving , at least , at three different velocities of about 100 , 180 , and @xmath492 km s@xmath21 . in particular",
    ", we identified at least a pair of knots in the counterjet ( knots z1 and z2 ) that apparently have been launched simultaneously with very different velocities .",
    "* the asymmetry in the average velocities of the jet and counterjet may be due to an asymmetric ambient medium .",
    "the observed differences in velocity of the knots of the same outflow lobe can be attributed to different launching radii in an extended `` warm '' disk wind scenario .",
    "the range of launching radii in the circumstellar accretion disk required to account for the observed range of velocities of the knots is @xmath493 au to @xmath494 au , which falls within the range of typical values determined for t tauri jets . * the observed wiggling of the hh 30 jet and counterjet is produced by the orbital motion of the jet source in a binary system .",
    "precession of the accretion disk , if present at all , appears to be a minor contribution in shaping the jet .",
    "the best fit to the shape of the jet is obtained with a binary system with a mass function @xmath1 @xmath2 , an orbital period @xmath0 yr , and an orbital velocity of @xmath495 km  s@xmath21 . adopting a value of the total stellar mass of @xmath3 @xmath2 @xcite",
    ", we obtain that the mass of the jet driving source is @xmath496 @xmath2 , the mass of the companion is @xmath497 @xmath2 , and the binary separation is @xmath498 au .",
    "the same value of the binary separation is inferred from the size of the inner cavity observed in the circumbinary disk @xcite , assuming it is produced by tidal truncation of the disk in a binary system .",
    "this result strongly supports our binary interpretation first proposed by @xcite .    in summary , the hh 30 jet / counterjet system appears to originate likely from a binary system of two stars of masses 0.31 @xmath2 ( the jet driving source ) and 0.14 @xmath2 , separated 18 au and orbiting with a period of 114 yr .",
    "the system is surrounded by a circumbinary disk with an outer radius of @xmath499 au and with an inner radius @xmath500 au .",
    "the driving source of the jet / counterjet appears to be surrounded by a circumstellar accretion disk with an outer radius @xmath501 au , and probably with an inner radius of @xmath502 au .",
    "the observed jet / counterjet knots reach velocities in the range @xmath223300 km s@xmath21 , arising from disk radii ranging from 0.07 au to 0.6 au .",
    "the two components of the binary system are currently roughly aligned along the line of sight , but their angular separation in the plane of the sky and orbital motions could be determined by future observations with the jvla or alma    g. a. , r. e. , r. l. , a. r. , and c. c .- g . are partially supported by spanish mci grants aya2008 - 06189-c03 and aya2011 - 30228-c03 , and feder funds .",
