    "a high - energy electron passing through a medium produces the electron - positron pair side by side with the radiation .",
    "the electroproduction process possesses many important peculiarities which will be discussed below .    generally speaking one",
    "has to consider two mechanisms of the process , the first one is the direct(one - step ) electroproduction of pair via the virtual intermediate photon .",
    "the second one is the cascade(two - step ) process when the electron emits the real photon at collision with one nucleus which converts into the pair on another nucleus .",
    "the interrelation of two mechanisms depends on the target thickness @xmath0 since the probability of the direct process is proportional to @xmath0 while the probability of the cascade process is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "these contributions have comparable values when the ratio @xmath2 is the radiation length ) is of the order of a few percent .    for the direct process the differential , over the energies of produced particles @xmath3",
    ", probability was found by kelner @xcite in the lowest over @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the charge of a nucleus , @xmath6=1/137 ) order of the perturbation theory ( for the derivation see also sec.26 in @xcite ) . for the direct process",
    "there are two types of diagrams : one - photon diagram when the pair is created by one virtual photon emitted from the electron at collision with a nucleus , and two - photon diagrams when the pair is created by two virtual photons connected with the initial electron and a nucleus . in the present paper the coulomb corrections",
    "are included in the probability contributions of both types of diagrams .    in the soft part of created particles spectrum ( @xmath7 is the energy of the initial electron )",
    "one can neglect the one - photon contribution and the two - photon contribution can be obtained using the equivalent photons method within the logarithmic accuracy ( see appendix b in @xcite ) . at low enough energies",
    "@xmath8 the multiple scattering of the initial electron results in distortion of the spectral distribution of the equivalent photons which can lead to a modification of the process probability .",
    "it is shown the effect of multiple scattering can be quite effectively studied in electroproduction process .",
    "just as in the radiation process the effect can be observed in the soft part of spectrum .    in sec.2 the probabilities of the direct process are presented .",
    "the new formulation of the equivalent photons method is given which includes the influence of multiple scattering .",
    "this method permits to find the alteration in the soft part of spectral distribution of created particles . in sec.3",
    "the probabilities of the cascade process taking into account the multiple scattering are considered .",
    "the probabilities , differential over one of created particle energy , are analyzed in sec.4",
    "the coulomb corrections to the direct electroproduction probability can be found using the method outlined in the review @xcite ( see also appendix a in @xcite ) .",
    "the probability for the one - photon diagrams contribution with the coulomb corrections taken into account in the case of complete screening has the form ( the system @xmath9 is used ) @xmath10\\bigg\\rbrace ,   \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the electron mass , @xmath12 is the euler dilogarithm , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number density of atoms in the medium , @xmath15 is the coulomb correction .",
    "it should be noted that in eq.([1 ] ) at @xmath16 a mutual compensation occurs in the braces and the expression in the braces becomes proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "the probability for the two - photon diagrams contribution with the coulomb corrections taken into account in the case of complete screening has the form @xmath18\\bigg\\rbrace ,   \\label{3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 the probabilities eqs.([1 ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) are calculated within the power accuracy ( neglected terms @xmath20 ) .",
    "in the soft part ( @xmath21 ) of spectral distribution @xmath22 one can include the influence of multiple scattering on the initial electron , the result is @xmath23 ,   \\label{5}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 here the function @xmath25 describes the pair creation probability in the equivalent photons method .",
    "appearance of the term @xmath26 in the function @xmath25 is connected with expansion of the characteristic equivalent photon emission angles @xmath27 due to the multiple scattering of the initial electron .",
    "let us consider this item in detail .",
    "the density of equivalent photon can be presented as ( see eq.(b.7 ) in @xcite ) @xmath28 ,   \\label{6a}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the squared minimal momentum transfer which is necessary for the photon with the energy @xmath30 to create the pair with the energies @xmath31 . in absence of multiple scattering @xmath32",
    "is defined by the kinematics of the virtual photon emission from the initial electron @xmath33 taking into account the multiple scattering one has @xmath34 ( see e.g. eqs.(2.10 ) , ( 2.25 ) , ( 2.26 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "so the equivalent photon spectrum at @xmath35 can be written as @xmath36dy .",
    "\\label{6c}\\ ] ] the differential probability of the pair creation by a photon in the case of complete screening has the form @xmath37 and we find that the term @xmath38 in eq.([5 ] ) corresponds to the equivalent photon method . the contribution of the multiple scattering is included in eq.([6 ] ) within the logarithmic accuracy .",
    "let us note that for heavy elements the value @xmath39 is of the order of a few tev ( e.g. @xmath39=2.73  tev for tungsten , @xmath39=2.27  tev for iridium ) , so for the electron energy of a few hundreds gev , @xmath40 at @xmath41 .",
    "it is known that the multiple scattering distorted the radiation spectrum when @xmath42 or the photon energy @xmath43 ( this is the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal(lpm ) effect ) , while for the pair creation process the lpm effect distorted the spectrum of created pair only when @xmath44 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so for available electron energies one have to take into account the multiple scattering in the cascade electroproduction process for the radiation part only .",
    "than the spectral distribution of cascade process taking into account the multiple scattering of the initial electron has the form @xmath45 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left[2(1-y)+y^2\\right ] \\left[\\psi(p)-\\ln p + \\frac{1}{2p}\\right]\\bigg\\rbrace ,   \\label{7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function ( see eq.(2.17 ) in @xcite ) , the value @xmath48 is defined in eq.([6 ] ) . in the term describing radiation ( i m @xmath49 ) the term @xmath50 is neglected .",
    "the contribution of this term does nt exceed a few per cent under considered conditions .",
    "this term is given by eq.(2.33 ) in @xcite ) and can be included in the relevant case . in the case when the multiple scattering of the initial electron may be neglected ( @xmath51 ) the spectral distribution of cascade process is @xmath52 .",
    "\\label{7a}\\ ] ] here the terms @xmath50 , neglected in eq.([7 ] ) , are taken into account .    in the cascade process side by side with radiation inside of a target",
    "one has to take into account the boundary radiation . using eq.(3.12 ) in @xcite",
    "( with regard for the factor 1/2 since photons emitted at fly out of a target ca nt create the pair ) and assuming that @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the plasma frequency ( in any medium @xmath55 ) one has @xmath56 putting together this probability and the probability eq.([5 ] ) we have that the terms with @xmath26 are canceled .",
    "so the sum of contributions of the equivalent and boundary photons does nt depend on multiple scattering .",
    "at photon energy @xmath30 decreasing starting with @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) the influence of multiple scattering on the radiation process becomes significant . at this energy",
    "the estimation of the interrelation of the different contributions is @xmath59    with further decreasing of photon energy the relative contribution of the cascade process is dropping both because of the logarithmic growth of the probability @xmath60 and because of the suppression of the real photon emission probability due to the multiple scattering of projectile ( the lpm effect ) . in this interval of photon energies",
    "( but for @xmath61 ) in the case when the value @xmath0 is low enough the thickness of the target can become less than the photon ( virtual or real ) formation length @xmath62 in this limiting case the contribution of real photons into the process probability vanishes and only the contribution of virtual photons remains .",
    "these photons build up outside a target where there is no influence of the multiple scattering .",
    "it should be noted that with photon energy decreasing the formation length of pair creation by a photon inside target is also decreasing ( @xmath63 ) and we can be out of the complete screening limit .",
    "however in this energy interval ( @xmath64 ) the equivalent photons method is applicable within the quite satisfactory accuracy and the cross section of the photo - process is known for arbitrary screening ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the probability of electroproduction differential over one of created particle energy only is of evident interest .",
    "it can be obtained by integration of the found probabilities over @xmath65 . for @xmath66 the main contribution into the integral gives the region @xmath67 ( with the exception of the contribution of one - photon diagrams which can be neglected in this energy region ) . for the ratio @xmath68",
    "one has @xmath69 at @xmath70 , @xmath71 at @xmath72 and @xmath73 at @xmath74 . using eq.([6 ] ) at @xmath75 and conserving the main term of decomposition over @xmath76 one obtains for the summary contribution of the equivalent and boundary photons @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the probability of pair creation by a photon in the target with thickness @xmath0 in the case of complete screening presented within power ( relativistic ) accuracy , neglected terms are @xmath79 .",
    "the quantity @xmath80 is the correction to the equivalent photons method .",
    "this correction is small numerically : e.g. for heavy elements ( @xmath81 ) , for ge @xmath82 .    for the cascade process contribution in the region @xmath83 one",
    "gets @xmath84 the spectral distributions of created positrons reflect the spectral distribution of photons ( up to common factor @xmath78 in eq.([11 ] ) and @xmath85 in eq.([12 ] ) ) .",
    "when the parameter @xmath48 is large the asymptotic regime for the radiation probability ( see eqs.(2.31),(2.32 ) of @xcite ) is realized at very high value of @xmath48 . because of this one has to use eq.([7 ] ) directly .",
    "conserving the main terms over @xmath86 we find @xmath87 where @xmath88 .    since the spectral distribution has the general factor @xmath89 its characteristic properties at variation of @xmath76 over a few order of magnitude one can track analyzing the function @xmath90 .",
    "for the same reason in figs 2 and 3 in the region under consideration ( @xmath91 ) the dependence of this combination on the positron energy @xmath92 is shown .",
    "the probabilities eqs.([3 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) were used in calculation .    in the fig.1",
    "the spectral density @xmath93 for thin targets is shown .",
    "the difference between curves 1 and 2 is due to the influence of multiple scattering .",
    "since the targets are quite thin , the difference is still small especially for @xmath94 .",
    "the integral @xmath95 gives the number of positron per one initial electron in the energy interval @xmath96 . for thickness @xmath97 one",
    "has @xmath98 for the positron energies interval 0.5 - 5 gev .",
    "the targets of mentioned thicknesses were used in the experiment na63 carried out recently at sps at cern ( for proposal see @xcite ) .",
    "the fig.2 is another look on the process which permits to trace details of the pair creation mechanism .",
    "the curves 2,5 in the right part increase first tending to the asymptotic eq.([12 ] ) and than decrease because of transition to the regime of eq.([13 ] ) at the characteristic energy @xmath99 .",
    "the curves 1,4 are described nearly completely by eq.([11 ] ) .",
    "the increase of combination @xmath90 is due to @xmath100 .",
    "this contribution dominates in the summary combination in the left part of the spectrum for @xmath97 and in the whole spectrum for @xmath101 ( curves 3,6 ) . because of this the relative influence of multiple scattering on the electroproduction process is falling .",
    "the fig.3 shows a different situation when the target is relatively thick .",
    "evidently here the influence of multiple scattering spreads to the more wide positron energy interval ( the region where the curve 2 decreases ) .",
    "the cascade mechanism dominates for the positron energy higher than 10 gev .    in the fig.4",
    "the difference between the curves 1 and 2 shows the influence of multiple scattering .",
    "this difference can be characterized by ratio ( see eqs.([3 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) , ( [ 7a ] ) ) @xmath102 in tungsten for the thickness @xmath103 cm one has at the initial electron energy @xmath104gev for the created positron energy @xmath105mev ( @xmath106 ) the value @xmath107 42% , and at the initial electron energy @xmath108gev for the created positron energy @xmath109 mev the value @xmath110 100% .",
    "the process of electron - positron pair production by a high - energy electron traversing amorphous medium is investigated .",
    "it is shown that the soft part of created particle spectrum may reduced due to the multiple scattering of the initial electron . in the direct process ( via the virtual intermediate photon ) the equivalent photon spectrum is changed under the influence of multiple scattering . in the cascade process ( via real intermediate photon ) the multiple scattering distorted the photon spectrum inside a target . besides , the contribution of the boundary photons appears .",
    "it is shown , within the logarithmic accuracy , that the change of the equivalent photon spectrum is canceled by the contribution of the boundary photons . as a result one has that the influence of multiple scattering may be neglected in the very thin targets ( @xmath111 ) , where the direct process dominates in the soft part of photon spectrum .",
    "the different situation arises in a more thick target of heavy elements ( @xmath112 a few % of @xmath113 ) . for the initial electron energy in the range of hundreds",
    "gev the multiple scattering substantially diminish the spectrum of created positrons in the range from hundreds mev to a few gev .",
    "this phenomenon can be used for further study of the influence of multiple scattering on higher order qed processes .",
