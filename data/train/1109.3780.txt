    "one of the most fundamental questions of astrophysics concerns the mass distribution after a self - gravitating system has relaxed to equilibrium .",
    "this problem , posed more than 6 decades ago , still remains unresolved , see the recent papers @xcite and references therein . in the astrophysical context , the answer to this question may help to shed light on a lot of intriguing theoretical puzzles , such as the physical mechanism responsible for the regularities observed in the light profile of elliptical galaxies and the mass distribution in the dark matter halos .",
    "the classical simulations of @xcite have produced the density profiles of dark matter halos that no present theory is capable of explaining , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the scope of the problem extends from the foundations of statistical mechanics to the large scale evolution of the universe , @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to construct a statistical theory that is able to successfully predict both the mass and the velocity distributions of a self - gravitating system after it has completed the process of collisionless relaxation . in this respect the one dimensional self - gravitating model ( odsgm ) of interacting mass sheets ,",
    "has proven very useful for understanding both the stellar dynamics and the cosmological models , see ( wright , miller & stein 1982 ; @xcite ) and references therein .",
    "although much simpler than the real three dimensional gravity , this model contains the essence of the gravitational problem : long - range potential  @xcite and collective motion damped by particle - wave interactions which leads to collisionless relaxation , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the odsgm is particularly convenient because the sheet - sheet interaction potential is not singular , so that the model can be easily simulated  @xcite . at the same time it contains much of the same complicated statistical mechanics ( campa et al .",
    "2009 ) of other systems with long - range forces : broken ergodicity and lack of mixing , which also plague gravity in three dimensions .    long before the empirical works of navarro et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 , 1997 ) lynden - bell ( lb ) proposed a statistical theory of self - gravitating systems based on the vlasov equation  @xcite .",
    "the lb theory has become known as the theory of violent relaxation .",
    "one of the fundamental assumptions of lb was that violent relaxation leads to an efficient phase - space mixing .",
    "the subsequent simulations , however , have shown that this is not the case ( @xcite ; @xcite ; levin et al .",
    "2008a , b ; @xcite ) . therefore , a new approach is needed if one wants to theoretically understand the structure of self - gravitating systems in equilibrium .",
    "we will work in thermodynamic limit  the number of sheets @xmath0 diverges , the mass of each sheet @xmath1 goes to zero , while the total mass @xmath2 of the system remains fixed , @xmath3 .",
    "the advantage of working with 1d system is that the gravitational potential is unbounded from above and bounded from below . as a consequence of this",
    " after a sufficient large time @xmath4 , known as the chandrasekhar time  a finite self - gravitating system must relax to the usual maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) equilibrium  @xcite . in the limit @xmath5 , the chandrasekhar time diverges and the system becomes trapped in an out - of - equilibrium stationary state  @xcite . although 3d self - gravitating systems never relax to mb equilibrium they also become trapped in a quasi - stationary state qss  ( levin et al .",
    "2008a , b ) . in fact , for real 3d self - gravitating systems , such as elliptical galaxies , the life time of the qss is larger than their proper life span  @xcite . for odsgm it has been observed that qss state has a very long life - span even for a small number of particles  @xcite .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we introduce the 1d gravitational sheet model . in section  [ vlasov ] we comment briefly on its general dynamics and present the results of numerical simulation . in section  [ envelope ]",
    "we derive the equation which is capable , over a short time span , to accurately describe the oscillations of the root - mean - square of particle positions . in section  [ corehalo ]",
    "we present the statistical - mechanics theory that is able to accurately predict both the velocity and the mass distribution in equilibrium , without any adjustable parameters .",
    "the more involved derivation of the envelope equation is left to the appendix of the paper ,  [ enve ] .",
    "the odsgm consists of @xmath0 sheets of mass @xmath6 in the @xmath7 plane , free to move along the @xmath8-axis . to simplify the calculations",
    ", we suppose that all the sheets have the same mass @xmath9 , where @xmath2 is the total mass of the system . the sheets interact through the one dimension gravitational potential that satisfies the poisson equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the gravitational constant and @xmath12 is the mass density .",
    "we define dimensionless variables by scaling mass , lengths , velocities , the potential , the mass density and the energy with respect to @xmath2 , @xmath13 ( an arbitrary length scale ) , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "all these scales correspond to setting @xmath18 and to defining the dynamical time scale as , @xmath19 it is then easy to show that a particle ( sheet ) at the origin with a mass density @xmath20 creates a long - range gravitational potential , @xmath21 systems with long - range interaction are very peculiar because in the thermodynamic limit the collision duration time diverges , and the dynamical evolution of the system is governed exactly by the collisionless boltzmann ( vlasov ) equation , @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the one particle distribution function , so that @xmath24 .",
    "clearly real self - gravitating systems do not rigorously obey the @xmath25 limit , nevertheless , in the astrophysical context the number of `` particles '' is usually very large , so that it constitutes a very good approximation .",
    "the vlasov equation has an infinite number of invariants called the cassimirs @xcite .",
    "two of these are mass and energy , @xmath26 @xmath27 respectively , where @xmath28 is the initial energy .",
    "linear @xmath29 is also a conserved quantity .",
    "however , by the symmetry of the problem and without loss of generality , it can be set to zero .",
    "in fact , any local functional of the distribution function is a cassimir invariant of the vlasov dynamics .",
    "unlike collisional systems which after a very short time relax to the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , the time evolution of the vlasov equation never ends . instead it progresses to smaller and smaller length scales . in practice , however , both experiments and simulations have only a finite resolution .",
    "it is in this , coarse - grained , sense that we say that the vlasov dynamics evolves to the stationary state .",
    "unlike the usual mb equilibrium , however , the stationary state reached through the process of collisionless relaxation depends explicitly on the initial particle distribution .      numerical solution of the vlasov equation is very complicated .",
    "one alternative is to perform directly the n - body simulation in which all particles evolve over time according to the usual newton equations of motion  @xcite .",
    "we consider a odsgm in which sheets are initially distributed in accordance with the water - bag distribution , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the heaviside step function and @xmath32 is the normalization constant obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eqvolconserv ] ) .",
    "the values @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the limits of the distribution function in the phase space , so that without loss of generality we set @xmath35 . due to the symmetry of the distribution , the total linear _ momentum",
    "_ is null and the only quantity other than the total mass to be conserved is the total energy @xmath36 .",
    "the halo formation is related to the initial condition through the only dimensionless parameter that remains after the rescaling of section [ model ]  the virial number , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the total kinetic and @xmath39 is the potential energy .",
    "when the virial condition @xmath40 is not satisfied , @xmath41 , the imbalance between the kinetic and the potential energies causes the system to develop collective oscillations which are then damped by particle - wave interactions , leading to the core - halo phase separation , fig.1 .",
    "self - gravitating sheets initially distributed according to the water - bag distribution with the virial number @xmath42 . ]    [ figlbch ]    our interest in studying the distributions with @xmath43 arises from the fact that there is not even a qualitative theory that is able to account for the mass and velocity distributions for such systems @xcite .",
    "systems with long - range forces display collective motion such as langmuir waves in plasmas or jeans waves in gravitational systems , @xcite .",
    "since there are no collisions , interaction of individual particles with the density waves is the mechanism that responsible for the transfer of energy .",
    "the particle - wave interaction dampens the density waves while at the same time transfers large amounts of energy to the individual particles .",
    "the interaction is similar to a surfer `` catching '' a wave  some particles can gain a large amount of energy from the bulk oscillations to escape from the gravitational cluster and move to high energy regions of the phase space .",
    "these particles will then form a tenuous halo that will surround the dense low - energy core .    to study the oscillation of the initial gravitational cluster , we define the _ envelope _ as @xmath44 .",
    "note that with this definition , at @xmath45 the envelope is exactly the same as the extent of the initial particle distribution @xmath46 . for sufficiently short times",
    ", most particles will still remain within the limits set by @xmath47 .",
    "differentiating @xmath47 twice with respect to time , we find an approximate dynamical equation satisfied by @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the virial number of the initial distribution ( the derivation is presented in appendix  [ enve ] )",
    ". we shall call this the `` envelope equation '' @xcite .",
    "equation  [ eqenvel ] enables us to study the dynamics of a test particle @xmath50 , subject to the oscillating potential produced by a uniform density distribution delimited by @xmath51 . a test particle moving in this potential",
    "will then evolve according to @xmath52 \\>\\ , \\ $ for$ \\",
    "\\,|x_i(t)|\\ge x_e(t ) \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eqenvel ] ) and @xmath53 is the sign function .",
    "-body dynamics simulation : ( a ) corresponds to the evolution of @xmath47 obtained from the @xmath0-body simulation ( dots ) while the solid line is calculated using the envelope equation .",
    "the time is in units of @xmath54 .",
    "( b ) represents the phase space after the first few oscillations and ( c ) is the poincar plot of the phase space produced by the test particles .",
    "note the appearance of the resonance islands both in the n - body and test particle simulation .",
    "the test particle model allows us to accurately calculate the location of the resonant orbit with the maximum extent @xmath55 .",
    "this will determine the maximum energy attained by the halo particles . at @xmath45 ,",
    "@xmath56 test particles were uniformly distributed from the center to slightly beyond the maximum core radius @xmath33 with initial velocity @xmath57 . ]    [ figenve ]    in fig .",
    "2 we compare the complete @xmath0-body simulation with the test particle trajectories obtained from the numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eqenvel ] ) and ( [ eqpoinc ] ) .",
    "the good agreement between the two reveals that for short times the envelope equation  [ eqenvel ] is very accurate for describing the initial oscillations of the odsgm .",
    "the formation of halo also occurs on a very short time scale  few oscillations of the envelope .",
    "indeed , from figs .",
    "2 ( b ) , ( c ) , we see that the test particle model allows us to accurately locate the resonant orbits  @xcite , which also delimit the extent of the halo in the full @xmath0-body simulations . thus , the test particle model allows us to calculate the maximum energy  corresponding to the resonant orbit  attained by any of the halo particles .",
    "this energy will be used in the next section to construct the core - halo distribution function .",
    "the jeans theorem states that `` any steady - state solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation depends on the phase - space coordinates only through integrals of motion of the given potential , and any function of the integrals yields a steady - state solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation '' ,  @xcite .",
    "thus , any function of energy is a solution to the vlasov equation . in particular ,",
    "the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( mb ) is also a stationary solution of the vlasov equation .",
    "however , it is important to remember that mb is not a global attractor of the vlasov dynamics  an arbitrary initial distribution of particles will not converge to the mb distribution , as happens for systems governed by short - range forces . in this paper",
    "we are interested in calculating the distribution to which the system will evolve , starting from an arbitrary water - bag - like initial condition , after the process of collisionless relaxation is completed .",
    "we first observe that the vlasov equation can be interpreted as a convective derivative of density over the phase - space , so that the distribution function evolves as an incompressible fluid . in the case of initial water - bag distribution",
    "this means that the phase - space density can not exceed that of @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the mechanism of core - halo phase separation now becomes clear .",
    "some particles enter in resonance with the rms bulk oscillations .",
    "they gain a lot of energy and escape from the main cluster , forming a tenuous halo . at the same time , evaporation of highly energetic particles",
    "dampens the core oscillations .",
    "this is similar to the process of evaporative cooling .",
    "the oscillations will stop when all of the free energy is exhausted .",
    "however , because of the constraint on the maximum density imposed by the vlasov dynamics , the system can not freeze  collapse to the minimum of the potential energy . instead , the particle distribution of the core approaches that of a fully degenerate fermi gas .",
    "with this physical insight in mind , we now propose an _ ansatz _ solution to the vlasov equation : @xmath60 + \\chi \\theta\\left[\\epsilon_h-\\epsilon\\right]\\theta\\left[\\epsilon-\\epsilon_f\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the fermi energy , @xmath62 is the halo ( resonance ) energy , and @xmath63 is the one particle energy .",
    "the halo energy is obtained simply by taking the most extended position of test particle @xmath55 when it crosses the @xmath64 axis , in others words @xmath65 .",
    "the fermi energy , @xmath61 , delimits the extent of the core region , and @xmath66 measures the phase space density inside the halo .",
    "both of these parameters are calculated self - consistently from the norm and energy conservation equations , eqs .",
    "( [ eqvolconserv ] ) and ( [ eqeneconserv ] ) .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "[ corehaloeq ] into the poisson equation and integrating the core - halo distribution function over velocity , the dimensionless poisson equation becomes @xmath67    solving this equation numerically and using the constraints eqs .",
    "( [ eqvolconserv ] ) and ( [ eqeneconserv ] ) yield the complete solution for the one - particle distribution function . in fig .",
    "3 we compare the theoretically calculated density and velocity distribution functions to the full @xmath0-body simulation . to obtain the distributions in the simulations ,",
    "the system is evolved for @xmath68 dynamical times until the stationary state is achieved . to get good statistics the histograms are constructed by binning the particle positions and velocities at four different times .",
    "an excellent agreement is found between the theory and the simulations , _ without any adjustable parameters_. note that the agreement is very good for both the virial numbers above and below @xmath69 . in the same figure we also plot , with the dashed lines , the initial density and the velocity distributions .",
    "it is clear that during the process of collisionless relaxation the system moves far from the initial condition .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that although the system has relaxed to the stationary state , this state does not correspond to the thermodynamic equilibrium . in particular",
    ", the velocity distribution does not have the equilibrium maxwell - boltzmann form .",
    "this also shows that one needs to take a special care when modeling collisionless system using hydrodynamic - like equations , since there might not be thermodynamic equilibrium even locally .     at t=1000 @xmath54 .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) are the stationary distribution for the initial water - bag with @xmath42 .",
    "the dotted lines are the initial distributions . ]",
    "[ figtheory ]",
    "we have presented a theory which allows us to _ a priori _ predict the density and the velocity distribution functions for a system of gravitationally interacting sheets .",
    "the theory is quantitatively accurate without any fitting parameters .",
    "the theory and the simulations show that in the thermodynamic limit this system does not evolve to the usual mb equilibrium .",
    "instead it becomes trapped in a non - ergodic , non - mixing state  once formed , the halo never again equilibrates with the core in the @xmath5 limit .",
    "although in this paper we have studied only water - bag - like initial distributions , the theory can be easily generalized to more complex functional forms @xcite .",
    "the next step in the development of the theory will be to include a specific cosmological model to account for the expansion of the universe .",
    "if this can be achieved , the theory might shed new light on the mass distribution in the dark - matter halos .",
