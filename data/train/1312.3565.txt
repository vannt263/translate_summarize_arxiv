    "even in the combustion of small hydrocarbons , the chemical kinetics has large underlying reaction mechanisms , and for complex hydrocarbons , the number of chemical species can be up to several hundreds and elementary reactions up to several thousands .",
    "accurate knowledge of the detailed reaction mechanisms is of great importance for understanding and a correct description of kinetically controlled transient combustion processes such as ignition and self - ignition processes ( e.g. engine knock ) , flame extinction , or transition from deflagration - to - detonation . if , however , real three - dimensional ( turbulent ) flows with large temperature and density gradients are considered , we have to use reduced chemical schemes , since the use of detailed reaction mechanisms involves massive computing times which can be difficult and even impossible to implement .",
    "development and exploitation of reliable detailed chemical kinetic models and identification of the important kinetic pathways and accurate kinetic - transport models remain among the major challenges in combustion science and technology being essential for the design of efficient and reliable engines and for controlling emissions .",
    "the availability of such models is essential for gaining scientific insight into important combustion phenomena including flame acceleration and stability , ignition processes , transition from deflagration - to - detonation ( ddt ) and for the design of advanced combustion engines .",
    "therefore , there is great interest in simplified - reduced chemical reaction schemes consisting of not too large number of elementary reaction . then the problem is to find criteria for option of a reliable detailed chemical kinetic model . a quintessential example of chain mechanisms in chemical kinetics and combustion science is the @xmath0 mechanism , which has been a major topic of research for many decades .",
    "comprehensive numerical modeling of the unsteady combustion should include a reliable detailed chemical reaction scheme for the understanding of complex multiscale phenomena observed in experiments , since a one - step model does not reproduce even two distinct stages of the combustion reaction : induction stage and exothermal one .",
    "it was shown in numerous numerical studies ( see e.g. @xcite that in many cases both quantitative and qualitative features of the studying processes depends on the choice of chemical kinetics model .",
    "moreover while studying unsteady processes such as flame acceleration , deflagration - to - detonation transition @xcite or flames within combustors @xcite one should use models correctly reproducing flame parameters in a wide range of pressures and temperatures .",
    "there are different reduced kinetics schemes , which validation procedures usually use @xmath1 and @xmath2 calculations and experimental databases containing data on induction periods , equilibrium temperature and composition of the combustion products and laminar flame speeds .",
    "usually , the ignition and combustion for verification databases are studied using the experimental setups far distinct from the setups used for transient processes studies . in some cases it may cause considerable differences between experimental data and those calculated using the chosen model .",
    "almost all the listed parameters are defined by the thermodynamic equilibrium laws .",
    "the only evolutionary parameter is an induction period determining the duration of the endothermal stage .",
    "however , in some cases the duration of the exothermal stage may be also principal for the process definition as the scale of energy release determines the gasdynamical flows .",
    "widely accepted standard numerical procedures for ignition parameters and for flame speed calculations are based on the @xmath1 solution and on the @xmath2 solution of the eigenvalue problem , which is distinguished mathematically from the computational gasdynamics setup used for transient combustion simulations .",
    "however instead of solving the eigenvalue problem one may use other approaches to simplify full reactive gasdynamics model ( as e.g. it was done in @xcite ) . on the other hand to simulate a transient problem",
    "one should validate the codes and models describing the real process involving pressure gradients , compressibility , convection , turbulence etc .",
    "therefore it is important to get the solution of basic problems using more general models which are planned to be used in the simulation of multidimensional unsteady problems .    in the present paper",
    "we evaluate different widely used kinetic schemes for hydrogen - air and hydrogen - oxygen combustion @xcite using the full gasdynamical models including standard transport model @xcite for laminar flame characteristics .",
    "the analysis takes into account the correlations between evolutionary parameters ( induction period and duration of exothermal stage ) and gasdynamical ones ( laminar flame speed and its thickness ) for hydrogen - air and hydrogen - oxygen mixtures at different initial pressures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is the formulation of the problem and numerical method . in section 3",
    "we perform calculations of the chemical time scales and gasdynamical parameters of the laminar flame in hydrogen - air mixtures .",
    "section 4 presents analysis of the hydrogen - oxygen flames . in section 5",
    "we formulate conclusions about the applicability of the chosen kinetic schemes in numerical simulations of the transient combustion processes .",
    "the governing equations are the one - dimensional time - dependent , multi - species reactive navier - stokes equations including the effects of compressibility , molecular diffusion , thermal conduction , viscosity and chemical kinetics for the reactive species with subsequent chain branching , production of radicals and energy release .",
    "@xmath3    @xmath4    @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    @xmath9    here we use the standard notations : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , are pressure , mass density , and flow velocity , @xmath13 - the mass fractions of the species , @xmath14 - the total energy density , @xmath15 - the internal energy density , @xmath16 - is the universal gas constant , @xmath17- the molar mass of i - species , @xmath18 , @xmath19 - the molar density , @xmath20- the viscous stress tensor , @xmath21 - is the constant volume specific heat , @xmath22- the constant volume specific heat of i - species , @xmath23 - the enthalpy of formation of i - species , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the coefficients of thermal conductivity and viscosity , @xmath26 - is the diffusion coefficients of i - species , @xmath27 - is the variation of i - species concentration ( mass fraction ) in chemical reactions",
    ".    the equations of state for the reactive mixture and for the combustion products were taken with the temperature dependence of the specific heats and enthalpies of each species borrowed from the janaf tables and interpolated by the fifth - order polynomials @xcite .",
    "the viscosity and thermal conductivity coefficients of the mixture were calculated from the gas kinetic theory using the lennard - jones potential @xcite .",
    "the system of gas dynamics equations is solved using lagrange - euler method @xcite , which was modified and approved by authors solving numerous 1d , 2d and 3d problems ( see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the system of chemical kinetics equations is solved with the aid of gear method .",
    "usually the verification of the reduced kinetic schemes covers the data on induction periods and equilibrium composition of the products and their temperature . the later are pure thermodynamical characteristics and are more or less in a good agreement with experimental data . in turn these parameters together with transport coefficients determine the laminar flame speed . to reproduce transient processes such as e.g. flame acceleration , ignition , etc .",
    "which are accompanied by compression and shock waves , one should take into account parameters such as induction periods and periods of exothermal reaction , which determine the chemical time scales competing with transport time scales in establishing the flame front - the zone of energy release which in fact determines the evolution of the flame . nevertheless , the even more important thing is the necessity of understanding and reproducing the pressure dependence of flame parameters .",
    "here we present analysis of these parameters given by the different kinetic schemes for @xmath28 and @xmath29-air mixtures .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows induction periods and exothermal stage durations dependencies on initial temperature for stoichiometric hydrogen - air mixture at 1atm calculated using different chemical schemes @xcite one can observe almost linear curves intersecting the induction period dependencies - these curves represent an exothermal stage duration which determines the time scale of energy release inside the reaction zone .",

    "experimental data are from @xcite.,width=340 ]    we analyzed here 7 schemes by agafonov @xcite , gri group @xcite , konnov @xcite , o conaire @xcite and warnatz @xcite .",
    "the schemes @xcite and @xcite are presented in two variants with different models for three - body collisions .",
    "this factor gives negligible difference in the induction periods at normal pressure but may affect the time scales of energy release as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . despite rather sensible differences in the low temperature region almost all the kinetic schemes reproduce quite close values of the induction periods at normal conditions . among the analyzed schemes one can clearly extract three main groups of kinetic schemes reproducing almost the same values of the induction periods :",
    "1 ) agafonov-1 and konnov , 2 ) agafonov-2 and o conaire , 3 ) two variants of warnatz schemes and gri scheme .",
    "the better agreement with an experimental data belongs to the second group together with quite sensible differences between members of the group .",
    "further we will use only four schemes : one from the first group , one from the third , one and two from the second one .",
    "the calculations of the laminar flame speeds @xmath30 at normal pressure ( 1atm ) for different equivalent ratio of hydrogen - air mixture for four schemes are presented in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "laminar flame speed dependence on equivalent ratio of hydrogen - air mixture .",
    "experimental data are from @xcite.,width=340 ]    the parameters of laminar flame for stoichiometric hydrogen - air mixture at different pressures , calculated for kinetic schemes @xcite are shown in table 1 together with available experimental values ( refs . ) and calculations from the original papers where the kinetic schemes were presented and validated by their authors .",
    "one can see that all these chemical schemes give close values for thermodynamic parameters and for induction times within accuracy @xmath31@xmath32 .",
    "the main differences are for low temperature values of induction period . however , in many cases this part is not essential if endothermic induction time is larger than characteristic gasdynamic time of the problem .",
    "more essential difference appears for induction time calculated using different kinetic schemes at elevated pressures .",
    "the induction time calculated using different schemes at @xmath33 2.5 , 5 , and 8.8atm are shown in figures  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the corresponding parameters of laminar flame are presented in the table 1 together with the data for 1atm .",
