    "tilings form a popular basis for many mathematical games , for games for the kids . in science , they are popular tools for rather different researches , in chemistry ( to describe quasicrystalline structures , e.g. , @xcite ) , in pure logics ( e.g. deciding classes of first order predicates defined on their syntax , see @xcite ) , in computational complexity ( as basic model for complexity , @xcite ) .",
    "the first famous result about tilings is the so - called domino problem : berger proved that given a tile set , we can not decide algorithmically whether it can tile the plane , @xcite . within the proof ,",
    "berger constructed the first aperiodic tile set  a tile set that can tile the plane but only non - periodically .",
    "it was the first tile set that allows only tilings of the plane with rather complex structure .",
    "thus , rather simple local rules can imply quite nontrivial global structure of a tiling .    since berger s paper , quite a lot of different algorithmic and combinatorial properties of aperiodic tilings were investigated .",
    "it was proven that a tile set that accepts only aperiodic tilings , must accept uncountably many of them , @xcite .",
    "many researchers tried to construct possibly simpler aperiodic tile sets ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of `` simplicity '' was interpreted in several different ways : as the number of tiles , algorithmic simplicity of the construction , etc .",
    "another avenue of research was constructing tile sets that guarantee not only aperiodicity , but also more sophisticated properties of tilings : non - recursivity , maximal algorithmic complexity ( of each tiling ) , robustness and fault - tolerance of tilings , and their combinations , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the fundamental question `` _ _ how complex can a tiling be ? _ _ '' also can be understood in terms of turing degrees of unsolvability . some partial answers to this question",
    "are known .",
    "first of all , we remark that for each tile set , the set of valid tilings is effectively closed ( i.e. , belongs to the class @xmath1 ) . in @xcite the property of cone",
    "- avoidance was proven : for each tile set @xmath2 and for every undecidable set @xmath3 there exists a @xmath2-tiling @xmath4 such that @xmath3 is not turing - reducible to @xmath4 .",
    "quite a complete study of turing degrees of tilings was given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the constructions that guarantee some nontrivial combinatorial properties or involve simulation of a turing machine require very different technical features .",
    "so it is rather difficult to combine in one and the same tiling properties of different nature . in this paper",
    "we try to do some kind of aggregation ; we combine the combinatorial property of quasiperiodicity with complexity issues .",
    "we prove that all upper cones of turing degrees above any @xmath0 class can be achieved by a tile set that produces only quasiperiodic tilings .",
    "this rather complex theorem has a more concrete consequence : we build a tile set that produces only quasiperiodic tilings , and none of these tilings is recursive .",
    "let us be more precise now . in this paper _",
    "wang tiles _ are unit squares with colored sides .",
    "a _ tile set _ is a finite family of tiles . for a given tile set",
    "the domino problem is to decide whether the entire plane can be tiled with these tiles .",
    "here we assume of course that we are given infinitely many copies of each tile ( tiles are prototypes ) ; in other words , we are allowed to place translated copies of the same tile into different sites of the plane ( rotations are not allowed ) . in a correct",
    "tiling the tiles in the neighbor cells must match ( sides in contact must have the same color ) .    if a tile set @xmath2 tiles the plane , we call these tilings @xmath2-tilings . more formally , a @xmath2-tiling can be defined as a mapping @xmath5 , where for each pair of neighboring cells @xmath6 the colors of the tiles @xmath7 and @xmath8 match each other on their neighboring sides .",
    "a tiling is called _ periodic _ if some nontrivial shift transforms it into itself .",
    "a tiling @xmath9 is called _ quasiperiodic _ ( or _ uniformly recurrent _ ) if every pattern that appears in this tiling , appears in every sufficiently large square of  @xmath9 .",
    "the domino problem ( existence of a tiling with a given tile set ) is algorithmically undecidable , @xcite .",
    "an interesting and nontrivial fact ( which follows from berger s theorem ) is that there exist tile sets that allow only aperiodic tilings of the plane .    the main result of this article is the following theorem that claims that some tile sets enforce at once two nontrivial properties of a tiling : quasiperiodicity and non - computability .    [ thm1 ]",
    "there exists a tile set ( a set of wang tiles ) @xmath2 such that ( i ) there exist @xmath2-tilings of the plane , ( ii ) all @xmath2-tilings are quasiperiodic , ( iii ) all @xmath2-tiling are non - computable .",
    "the tile set from theorem  [ thm1 ] is _ not minimal _",
    "( we can not claim that all @xmath2-tilings contain the same finite pattern ) .",
    "in fact , minimality can not be combined with non computability : each minimal tile set allows at least one computable tiling , see @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", minimality can be combined with aperiodicity , see theorem  [ thm2 ] below .",
    "[ thm1-bis ] for every effectively closed set @xmath10 there exists a tile set @xmath2 such that ( i ) all @xmath2-tilings are quasiperiodic , ( ii ) the turing degrees of all @xmath2-tiling make up exactly the upper cone of @xmath11 ( i.e. , the class of all turing degrees @xmath12 such that @xmath13 for at least one @xmath14 ) .    for every tile set",
    "@xmath2 , the set of @xmath2-tilings is alway effectively closed .",
    "moreover , if all @xmath2-tilings are strongly quasiperiodic , then the class of turing degrees of all @xmath2-tilings is known to be upward closed , see @xcite .",
    "thus , theorem  [ thm1-bis ] gives a precise characterisation of the turing spectra of quasiperiodic tilings : they are exactly the upward closed sets in @xmath0 .",
    "notice that theorem  [ thm1-bis ] does not imply the result of @xcite ( a construction of a minimal subshift of finite type with a nontrivial turing spectrum that consists of uncountably many cones with disjoint bases ) .",
    "the reason is again that the tile sets constructed in theorem  [ thm1-bis ] are not minimal .",
    "we prove theorem  [ thm1 ] and theorem  [ thm1-bis ] using the technique of fixed - point tilings from  @xcite , with some suitable extensions .",
    "though conceptually this technique is not very difficult , a very formal explanation would involve many ( sometimes excessive ) technical details . in order to meet the space limitations of the conference proceedings and also to make the argument more accessible , we present it in a less formalised way , starting with a proof of a simpler theorem  [ thm2 ] below .",
    "being somewhat sketchy , we nevertheless do not skip any important part of the construction , and we emphasise the parallels and differences with the previously known construction of a fixed - point tilings in  @xcite .    the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "first we remind the reader the core ideas of the fixed - point tiling from @xcite and explain how this technique implies aperiodicity of tilings .",
    "then we upgrade the construction and build a tile set that combines the properties of aperiodicity and quasiperiodicity .",
    "after that we prove the main results of the paper .",
    "our proof is based on the _ fixed point _ construction from @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this argument is that we can enforce in a tiling a kind of _ self - similar _ structure . in what follows",
    "we remind the principal ingredients of this construction ( here we follow the notations from @xcite ) .",
    "the reader familiar with the technique used in @xcite can skip this section and go directly to section  3 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a tile set and @xmath15 be an integer .",
    "we call by a _ macro - tile _ an @xmath16 square correctly tiled by matching tiles from @xmath2 .",
    "every side of a @xmath2-macro - tile contains a sequence of @xmath17 colors ( of tiles from @xmath2 ) ; we refer to this sequence as a _ macro - color_. further , let @xmath18 be some set of @xmath2-macro - tiles ( of size @xmath19 ) .",
    "we say that @xmath2 _ implements _ @xmath18 if ( i ) some @xmath2-tilings exist , and ( ii ) for every @xmath2-tiling there exists a unique lattice of vertical and horizontal lines that cuts this tiling into @xmath19 macro - tiles from @xmath18 .",
    "( we do not require that all macro - tiles from @xmath18 appear in every @xmath2-tiling . )",
    "the value of @xmath17 is called the _ zoom factor _ of this implementation .",
    "a tile set @xmath2 is called _ self - similar _ if it implements some set @xmath18 of @xmath2-macro - tiles with some zoom factor @xmath15 and @xmath18 is isomorphic to @xmath2 .",
    "this means that there exist a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath2 and @xmath18 such that the matching pairs of @xmath2-tiles correspond exactly to the matching pairs of @xmath18-macro - tiles . by definition , for a self - similar tile set",
    "@xmath2 each tiling can be uniquely split into @xmath19 macro - tiles ( the set of all macro - tiles is isomorphic to the initial tile set @xmath2 ) ; further , the grid of macro - tiles can be grouped into blocks of size @xmath20 , where each block is a macro - tile of rank @xmath21 ( again , the set of all macro - tiles of rank @xmath21 is isomorphic to the initial tile set @xmath2 ) , etc .",
    "it is not hard to deduce from this observation the following statement .",
    "[ thm - folklore ] a self - similar tile set @xmath2 has only aperiodic tilings .",
    "the proof is based on a simple observation : every period ( if it exists ) should be a multiple of @xmath17 , since the lattice of vertical and horizontal lines that cuts this tiling into @xmath19 macro - tiles must be _",
    "unique_. similarly , a period must be a multiple of @xmath22 ( to respect the uniquely defined grid of macro - macro - tiles ) , a multiple of @xmath23 , etc .",
    "it follows that a period must greater than any integer ; see details in @xcite .",
    "thus , if we want to construct an aperiodic tile set , then it is enough to present an instance of a self - similar tile set .",
    "below we discuss a very general construction of self - similar tile sets .",
    "assume that we have a tile set @xmath18 where each color is a @xmath24-bit string ( i.e. , the set of colors @xmath25 ) and the set of tiles @xmath26 is presented by a predicate @xmath27 ( the predicate is true if and only if the quadruple @xmath28 corresponds to a tile from @xmath18 ) .",
    "assume that we have some turing machine @xmath29 that computes @xmath30 .",
    "let us show how to implement @xmath18 using some other tile set @xmath2 , with a large enough zoom factor @xmath17 .",
    "we will build a tile set @xmath2 where each tile `` knows '' its coordinates modulo @xmath17 .",
    "this information is included in the tiles colors .",
    "more precisely , for a tile that is supposed to have coordinates @xmath31 modulo @xmath17 , the colors on the left and on the bottom sides should involve @xmath31 , the color on the right side should involve @xmath32 , and the color on the top side , respectively , involves @xmath33 , see fig .  1 .     [ pic1 ]     [ pic2 ]    this means that every @xmath2-tiling can be uniquely split into blocks ( macro - tiles ) of size @xmath19 , where the coordinates of cells ranges from @xmath34 in the bottom - left corner to @xmath35 in top - right corner , fig .",
    "so , intuitively , each tile `` knows '' its position in the corresponding macro - tile .",
    "in addition to the coordinates , each tile in @xmath2 should have some supplementary information encoded in the colors on its sides .",
    "we refer to this additional information as the _ shade _ of the color . on the border of a macro - tile ( where one of the coordinates is zero )",
    "only two additional shades ( say , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) are allowed .",
    "thus , for each macro - tile of size @xmath19 the corresponding macro - colors represent a string of @xmath17 zeros and ones .",
    "we will assume that @xmath38 .",
    "we allocate @xmath24 bits in the middle of a macro - tile sides and make them represent colors from @xmath39 ; all other bits on the sides of a macro - tile are zeros .",
    "now we introduce additional restrictions on tiles in @xmath2 that will guarantee the required property : the macro - colors on the macro - tiles satisfy the relation @xmath30 . to achieve this",
    ", we ensure that bits from the macro - tile side are transferred to the central part of the tile , and the central part of a macro - tile is used to simulate a computation of the predicate @xmath30 .",
    "we fix which cells in a macro - tile are `` wires '' ( we may assume that wires do not cross each other ) and then require that these tiles carry the same ( transferred ) bit on two sides .",
    "the central part of a macro - tile ( of size , say @xmath40 ) should represent a time - space diagram of @xmath29 s computation ( the tape is horizontal , time goes up ) .",
    "this is done in a standard way .",
    "we require that computation terminates in an accepting state ( if not , no correct tiling can be formed ) , see fig .  3 .",
    "[ pic3 ]     [ pic4 ]    to make this construction work , the size of macro - tile ( the number @xmath17 ) should be large enough : first , we need enough space for @xmath24 bits to propagate , second , we need enough time ( i.e. , height ) so all accepting computations of @xmath29 terminate in time @xmath41 and on space @xmath41 ( where the size of the computation zone @xmath41 can not be greater than the size of a macro - tile ) .    in this construction",
    "the number of additional shades depends on the machine @xmath29 ( the more states it has , the more additional shades we need to simulate the computation in the space - time diagram ) . to avoid this dependency , we replace @xmath29 by a fixed universal turing machine",
    "@xmath42 that runs a program simulating @xmath29 .",
    "we may assume that the tape has an additional read - only layer .",
    "each cell of this layer carries a bit that never changes during the computation ; these bits are used as a program for the universal machine .",
    "so in the computation zone the columns carry unchanged bits ; the construction of a tile set guarantees that these bits form the program for @xmath42 , and the computation zone of a macro - tile represents a view of an accepting computation for that program , see fig .  4 .",
    "in this way we get a tile set @xmath2 that has @xmath43 tiles and implements @xmath18 .",
    "( this construction works for all large enough @xmath17 . ) in the updated construction the tile set still depends on the program simulated in the computational zone .",
    "however , this dependency is essentially reduced : the simulated program ( and , implicitly , the predicate @xmath30 ) affects only the rules for the tiles used in bottom line of the computational zone .",
    "the colors on the sides of all other tiles are universal and do not depend on the simulated tile set  @xmath2 .      in the previous section",
    "we explained how to implement a given tile set @xmath18 ( represented as a program for the universal tm ) by another tile set @xmath2 with large enough zoom factor @xmath17 .",
    "now we want @xmath2 be isomorphic to @xmath18 .",
    "this can be done using a construction that follows kleene s fixed - point theorem .",
    "note that most steps of the construction of @xmath2 do not depend on the program for @xmath29 ( the coordinates of tiles that make the skeleton of a macro - tile , the information transfer along the wires , the propagation of unchanged program bits , and the space - time diagram for the universal machine in the computation zone ) .",
    "let us fix these rules as part of @xmath18 s definition and set @xmath44 , so that we can encode @xmath43 colors by @xmath24 bits . from this definition",
    "we obtain a program @xmath45 for the tm that checks that macro - tiles behave like @xmath2-tiles in this respect .",
    "we are almost done with the program @xmath45 .",
    "the only remaining part of the rules for @xmath2 is the hardwired program .",
    "we need to guarantee that the computation zone in each macro - tile carries the very same program @xmath45 .",
    "but since the program is written on the tape of the universal machine , it can be instructed to access its own bits and check that if a macro - tile belongs to the computation zone , this macro - tile carries the correct bit of the program .    it remains to explain the choice of @xmath17 and @xmath41 ( note that the value of the zoom factor @xmath17 and the size of the computation zone @xmath41 are hardwired in the program ) .",
    "we need it to be large enough so the computation described above ( which deals with inputs of size @xmath46 ) can fit in the computation zone .",
    "the computations are rather simple ( polynomial in the input size , i.e. , @xmath47 , so they easily fit in space and time bounded by @xmath48 .",
    "this completes the construction of a self - similar aperiodic tile set .",
    "now it is not hard to verify that the constructed tile sets ( 1 ) allows a tiling of the plane , and ( 2 ) each tiling is self - similar .",
    "applying proposition  [ thm - folklore ] we obtain the following proposition .",
    "there exists a tile set @xmath2 such that there exist @xmath2-tilings of the plane , and each @xmath2-tiling is aperiodic .    in the next section",
    "we will upgrade the basic construction of the fixed - point tile set .",
    "so far we should keep in mind that in such a tile set all tiles can be classified into three types :    * the `` skeleton '' tiles that keep no information except for their coordinates in a macro - tile ; these tiles work as building blocks for our hierarchical structure ; * the `` wires '' that transmit the bits of macro - colors from the frontier of the macro - tile to the computation zone ; * the tiles of the computation zone ( intended to simulate the space - time diagram of the universal turing machine ) .",
    "the same is true for macro - tiles , super - macro - tiles , etc . ; i.e. , each macro - tile is a `` skeleton '' block , or a part of a `` wire '' , or a cell in the computation zone in the macro - tile of higher rank .",
    "before we approach the main result , we prove a simpler statement ; we show that there exists a tile set such that all tilings are both _",
    "quasiperiodic _ and _",
    "aperiodic_.    [ thm2 ] there exists a tile set ( a set of wang tiles ) @xmath2 such that ( i )  there exist @xmath2-tilings of the plane ; ( ii )  each @xmath2-tiling is quasiperiodic ; moreover , the set of @xmath2-tilings is minimal ( i.e. , all @xmath2-tilings contain the same finite patterns ) ; ( iii )  each @xmath2-tiling is aperiodic .",
    "this result was originally proven in @xcite ( for a tile set @xmath2 constructed in @xcite ) .",
    "the general construction of a fixed - point tiling does not imply the property of quasiperiodicity .",
    "in fact , for tilings described above , each pattern that includes only `` skeleton '' tiles ( or `` skeleton '' macro - tiles of some rank @xmath24 ) must appear infinitely often , in all homologous position inside all macro - tiles of higher rank .",
    "however , this is not the case for patterns that include tiles from the `` communication zone '' or the `` communication wires '' .",
    "informally , the problem is that even a very small pattern can involve the information relevant for a macro - tile of arbitrarily high rank .",
    "so we can not guarantee that a similar pattern appears somewhere in the neighborhood . to overcome this difficulty we need some new idea and new technical tricks .",
    "first of all , without essential modification of the construction we can enforce the following additional properties of a tiling :    * in each macro - tile , the size of the computation zone @xmath41 is much less than the size of the macro - tile @xmath17 .",
    "technically , in what follows we will need to reserve free space in a macro - tile to insert @xmath49 ( some constant number ) of copies of each @xmath50 pattern from the computation zone ( of this macro - tile ) .",
    "this requirement is easy to meet .",
    "we may assume that the size of a computation zone in a macro - tile of size @xmath19 is only @xmath48 .",
    "* we require that the tiling inside the computation zone satisfies the property of @xmath51-_determinicity _ : if we know all colors on the borderline of a @xmath51-pattern inside of the computation zone ( i.e. , a tuple of @xmath52 colors ) , then we can uniquely reconstruct the @xmath53 tiles of this pattern .",
    "again , we do not need any new idea : this requirement is met if we simulate the space - time diagram of a turing machine in a natural way .",
    "* the communication channels in a macro - tile ( the wires that transmit the information from the macro - color on the borderline of this macro - tile to the bottom line of its computation zone ) must be isolated from each other .",
    "the distance between every two wires must be greater than @xmath21 from each other .",
    "that is , each @xmath50-pattern can touch at most one communication wire .",
    "also we will need a somewhat more essential modification of the construction .",
    "we discuss it in the next section .",
    "to achieve the property of quasiperiodicity , we should guarantee that every finite pattern that appears once in a tiling , must appear in each large enough square .",
    "if a tile set @xmath2 is self - similar , then in every @xmath2-tiling each finite pattern can be covered by at most @xmath53 macro - tiles ( by a @xmath51-pattern ) of an appropriate rank .",
    "thus , to prove theorem  [ thm2 ] it is enough to guarantee that each @xmath51 group of macro - tiles ( of each rank ) that ever appears in a tiling , must appear in eachl large enough squares in it .",
    "this property is not true for the tile set constructed above .",
    "as we noticed above , this is obviously true for a @xmath51 pattern that involves only skeleton macro - tiles ( we can find an identical pattern in the neighboring macro - tile of the appropriate rank ) ; however , this property can be false for patterns that touch the communication wires or the computation zone . to achieve the desired property we need to modify the basic construction . to this end",
    "we implement in our construction one new feature .    * the new feature : * notice that for each @xmath51-window that touches the computation zone or the communication wires there exist only a bounded number @xmath54 of ways to tile them correctly ( and make a correct tiling ) .",
    "this constant @xmath54 depends on the alphabet of the tape and the number of internal states of the universal turing machine . for each possible position of a @xmath51-window in the computation zone or in the communication wires and for each possible filling of this window by tiles",
    ", we reserve a special @xmath51-_slot _ in a macro - tile ( somewhere far away from the computation zone and from all communication wires ) and define the neighbors around this slot in such a way that only these specific @xmath50 patterns can patch it .",
    "note that the tiles around this `` know '' their real coordinates in the bigger macro - tile , while the tiles inside the slot do not ( they `` believe '' to be tiles in the computation zone , though they are in a `` slot '' outside of it ) .",
    "an example of such a slot is shown in fig .",
    "5 . in fig .",
    "6 we show how these `` slots '' are placed in a macro - tile .",
    "this simple trick is the sharpest difference between this construction and the fixed - point tilings known before : now some tiles do not `` know '' their real position in the ambient macro - tile .",
    "-pattern of tiles from the computation zone ( the grey squares ) . in the picture",
    "we show the `` coordinates '' encoded in the colors on the sides of each tile .",
    "the colors of the bold lines ( the blue lines between white and grey tiles and the bold black lines between grey tiles ) contain some information beyond coordinates  these colors involve the bits used to simulate a space - time diagram of the universal turing machine .",
    "( we do not show all the corresponding bits explicitly . )",
    "the `` real '' coordinates of the bottom - left corner of this slot are @xmath55 , while the `` natural '' coordinates of the corresponding patterns ( when it appears in the computation zone ) are @xmath56 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] [ pic5 ]     [ pic6 ]    here we use ( a ) the property of @xmath51-determinicity of the computation zone ( there is a unique way to put tiles in the `` slot '' ) , and ( b ) the fact that we have enough room to put in a macro - tile the slots for all @xmath50-patters that can appear in the computation zone or along the communication wires .",
    "( here we use the fact that the size of the computational zone @xmath40 and the lengths of all communication wires @xmath57 in a macro - tile are much less than the total area of a macro - tile @xmath19 . )",
    "this feature guarantees that each @xmath51 pattern from the computational zone appears at least once in each macro - tile ( such a pattern appears once in each macro - tile in the introduced `` slots '' and possibly once again in the computation zone of this macro - tile ) .",
    "we choose the positions of the `` slots '' in the macro - tile so that coordinates can be computed by a short program in time polynomial in @xmath58 .",
    "we require that the positions of all slots are disjoint , and they do not touch each other .",
    "this precaution is needed to guarantee that the tiles used in the slots do not damage the general structure of the macro - tiles .    for a tile set with a new feature",
    ", every tiling enjoys a new property : every @xmath50-pattern of tiles touching the computation zone or a communication wire , must appear at least once in _ each _ macro - tile ( hence , this pattern must appear in each large enough square ) .",
    "of course , the property of self - similarity implies that similar statements hold for @xmath50-pattern of macro - tiles of each ranks @xmath24 .",
    "thus , we proved that every @xmath59 pattern that appear in a @xmath2-tiling , must appear in each large enough square in this tiling ; moreover , this pattern must appear in each large enough square in _ all _ @xmath2-tilings .",
    "hence , the constructed tile set satisfies the requirements of theorem  [ thm2 ] .",
    "to prove theorem  [ thm1 ] , we need a slightly more sophisticated construction .",
    "we need a self - similar tiling with _ variable zoom factor _ , see @xcite for details . in this version of the construction the size of a macro - tile of rank",
    "@xmath60 is equal to @xmath61 , for some suitable sequence of zooms @xmath62 , @xmath63 we may assume that @xmath64 for some constant @xmath39 .",
    "now each macro - tile of rank @xmath60 must `` know ''",
    "its own rank ( that is , the binary representation of @xmath60 is written on the tape of the turing machine simulated on the computation zone ) .",
    "this information is used by a macro - tile to simulate the next rank macro - tiles properly .",
    "the size of the computational zone @xmath65 should also grow as a function of rank @xmath60 ( easily computable from @xmath60 ) ; again , we may assume that @xmath66 .    also we may require that all macro - tiles of rank @xmath60 contain in their computational zone the prefix ( e.g. , of length @xmath67 ) of some infinite sequence @xmath68 the bits of this prefix are propagated by wires to the neighboring macro - tiles , so all macro - tiles of the same rank contain the same bits @xmath69 the usual self - simulation guarantees that the bits of @xmath70 embedded into a macro - tile of rank @xmath71 extends the prefix embedded in a macro - tile of rank @xmath60 .",
    "since the size of the computational zone increases as a function of rank @xmath60 , the entire tiling of the plane involves an infinite sequence of bits @xmath70 .",
    "the construction becomes interesting if we can enforce some special properties of the embedded sequence @xmath70 .",
    "for example , we can guarantee that it is not computable .",
    "indeed , let us make the machine in the computation zone do some new job : let it enumerate two non - separable enumerable sets ( on each level @xmath60 we run the simulation for the number of steps that fits the computation zone available in a macro - tile of rank @xmath60 ) .",
    "then we can require that @xmath70 is a separator between these two sets , and in each level , the machine verifies that the ( partially ) enumerated sets are indeed separated by the given prefix of @xmath70 .",
    "combining all ingredients together , we obtain a tile set @xmath2 , which is self - similar in a generalised sense ( with a variable zoom factor ) , with two nontrivial properties : all @xmath2-tilings are non - computable and quasiperiodic .",
    "thus , we proved theorem  [ thm1 ] .    _ a technical remark _ : notice that in this construction we can not control precisely the sequence @xmath70 embedded in the tiling ( we can specify the two non - separable enumerable sets that are `` enumerated '' in a tiling , but we can not define uniquely the separator @xmath70 between them ) . thus , our tile set accepts tilings corresponding to infinitely many sequences @xmath70 , and it is not minimal .",
    "this is not surprising : if an effectively closed subshift contains no computable points , then it can not be minimal ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the proof of theorem  [ thm1-bis ] , in the construction used in this section we can not claim that there exist only @xmath49 ways to fill by a quadruple of macro - tiles of rank @xmath24 a slot of size @xmath72 placed somewhere in a macro - tiles of rank @xmath73 . indeed , these macro - tiles involve a prefix of @xmath70 , and there exist potentially many different sequences @xmath70 .",
    "however , once @xmath70 is fixed , there rest only a constant number of @xmath51 macro - tiles of rank @xmath24 that fit the given position in the next level macro - tile .",
    "this observation allows to reuse the `` new feature '' from the proof of theorem  [ thm2 ] .    with essentially the same technique we can prove theorem  [ thm1-bis ] .",
    "we employ again the idea of embedding of an infinite sequence @xmath70 in a tiling .",
    "technically , we require that all macro - tiles of rank @xmath24 should involve on their computational zone the same finite sequence of @xmath74 bits , which is understood as a prefix of @xmath70 ; we guarantee that the prefix embedded in macro - tiles of rank @xmath73 is compatible with the prefix available to the macro - tiles of rank @xmath24 .",
    "further , since @xmath10 is in @xmath0 , we can enumerate the ( potentially infinite ) list of patterns that should not appear in @xmath70 . on each level , the macro - tiles allocate some part of the available space and time ( limited by the size of the computational zone available on this level ) to run the enumeration of @xmath10 ; every time a new element of @xmath10 is enumerated , the algorithm ( simulated in the computational zone ) verifies that the found forbidden pattern does not appear in the prefix of @xmath70 accessible to macro - tiles of this level . since the computational zone in a macro - tile of rank @xmath24 becomes bigger and bigger as @xmath24 increases , the enumeration extends longer and longer .",
    "thus , a sequence @xmath70 can be embedded in an infinite tiling , if and only if this sequence does not contain any forbidden pattern ( i.e. , this @xmath70 belongs to @xmath10 ) .    what are the turing degrees of tilings in the described tile set ?",
    "for our tile set , every tiling is defined by three infinite parameters : the sequence of bits @xmath70 embedded in this tiling , and two sequences of integers @xmath75 that specifies the shifts ( the vertical and the horizontal ones ) of macro - tiles of each level relative to the origin of the plane .",
    "this information is enough to reconstruct the tiling .",
    "indeed , @xmath76 and @xmath77 define the hierarchical structure of the macro - tiles : on each level @xmath24 we should split the macro - tiles of the previous rank into blocks of size @xmath78 ( @xmath24-level macro - tiles ) , and there are @xmath79 ways to choose the grid of horizontal and vertical lines that define this splitting . and the content of the computational zones of all macro - tile is defined by the prefixes of @xmath70 .",
    "conversely , given a tiling as an oracle , we can ( computably ) extract from it the digits of the sequences @xmath70 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "it remains to notice that @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be absolutely arbitrarily .",
    "thus , the turing degree of a tiling is the turing degree of @xmath80 , which can be arbitrary degree not less than @xmath70 .",
    "that is , the set of degrees of tilings is exactly the upper closure of @xmath11 .",
    "so we get the statement of theorem  [ thm1-bis ] .",
