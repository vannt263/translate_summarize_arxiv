    "we consider a discrete memoryless ( dm ) broadcast channel where the sender wishes to communicate common as well as separate messages to two receivers  @xcite .",

    "a @xmath4 code for this channel consists of ( i ) three messages @xmath5 uniformly distributed over @xmath6\\times [ 1 , 2^{nr_1}]\\times [ 1,2^{nr_2}]$ ] , ( ii ) an encoder that assigns a codeword @xmath7 , for each message triplet @xmath8\\times [ 1 , 2^{nr_1}]\\times [ 1,2^{nr_2}]$ ] , and ( iii ) two decoders , one that maps each received @xmath9 sequence into an estimate @xmath10\\times [ 1 , 2^{nr_1}]$ ] and another that maps each received @xmath11 sequence into an estimate @xmath12\\times [ 1 , 2^{nr_2}]$ ] .",
    "the probability of error is defined as @xmath13 a rate tuple @xmath14 is said to be achievable if there exists a sequence of @xmath15 codes with @xmath16 .",
    "the capacity region of the broadcast channel is the closure of the set of achievable rates .",
    "the capacity region for this channel is known only for some classes , including the degraded @xcite , less noisy@xcite , more capable@xcite , deterministic@xcite and semi - deterministic channels@xcite .",
    "additionally , general inner bounds by cover @xcite , van der meulen  @xcite and marton  @xcite and outer bounds by krner and marton  @xcite and sato  @xcite have been established .",
    "furthermore , the krner and marton  @xcite outer bound was found to be tight for all cases where capacity is known .    in this paper",
    "we introduce an outer bound on the capacity region of the dm broadcast channel based on results in  @xcite and show that it is strictly tighter than existing outer bounds .",
    "the outer bound is presented in the next section . in section  [",
    "se : nocommon ] , the outer bound is specialized to the case of no common information . in section",
    "[ subse : km ] , it is shown that that when there is no common information , our outer bound is contained in the krner - marton bound and in section  [ se : bssc ] it is shown that this containment is strict .",
    "the following is an outer bound to the capacity region of the two - receiver dm broadcast channel .",
    "[ th : outer ] the set of rate triples @xmath17 satisfying @xmath18 for some joint distribution of the form @xmath19 constitutes an outer bound to the capacity region for the dm broadcast channel .",
    "the arguments are essentially the same as those used in the converse proof for the more capable broadcast channel class @xcite .",
    "observe that @xmath20 where ( a ) follows by fano s inequality and ( b ) follows from the fact that conditioning decreases entropy .",
    "now defining the random variable @xmath21 , we obtain @xmath22 in a similar fashion observe that @xmath23 now , consider @xmath24 where we define the random variable @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .    in a similar fashion @xmath27 where @xmath28 for all @xmath26 .",
    "lastly , consider @xmath29 @xmath30 note that @xmath31 and further , @xmath32    combining equations , , , we obtain @xmath33 @xmath34 the equality ( d ) follows from the well known csiszar identity ( see lemma 7 in @xcite ) : @xmath35    in a very similar fashion , we can also obtain @xmath36    define the time sharing random variable @xmath37 to be independent of @xmath38 and uniformly distributed over @xmath39 and define @xmath40 .",
    "clearly we have @xmath41 similarly , @xmath42 further , @xmath43 and similarly @xmath44    the independence of the messages @xmath45 and @xmath46 implies the independence of the auxiliary random variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 as specified .    since the probability of error",
    "is assumed to tend to zero , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 also tend to zero as @xmath51 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "note that the outer bound given in theorem  [ th : outer ] immediately leads to the following outer bound for the case when there is no common information , i.e. , @xmath52 .",
    "the set of all rate pairs @xmath53 satisfying @xmath54 for some joint distribution of the form @xmath55 constitutes an outer bound on the capacity of the dm broadcast channel with no common information .",
    "the following theorem gives a _ possibly _ weaker outer bound that we consider for the rest of the paper .",

    "the set of rate pairs @xmath53 satisfying @xmath56 for some choice of joint distributions @xmath57 constitutes an outer bound to the capacity region for the dm broadcast channel with no common information .",
    "this follows by redefining @xmath47 as @xmath58 and @xmath48 as @xmath59 in equation .    in the following subsections",
    "we prove results that aid in the evaluation of the above outer bound .",
    "denote by @xmath62 the outer bound in theorem  [ th : obproper ] and let @xmath63 be the same bound but with @xmath60 restricted to be a deterministic function of @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath64 for all @xmath65 .",

    "the proof of ( iv ) follows similarly .",
    "the following corollary follows from the above lemma , the fact that @xmath70 is a deterministic function of @xmath98 , and the fact that @xmath99 form markov chains with @xmath100 .",
    "the proofs are straightforward and are therefore omitted .",

    "we now establish bounds on the cardinality of @xmath47 and @xmath48 . from remark",
    "[ re : unnec ] , we know that @xmath117 can be arbitrary .",
    "[ fa : cons ] given @xmath118 , if @xmath119 is consistent , i.e. , @xmath120 for every @xmath121 , then there exist @xmath122 and @xmath117 that are consistent with @xmath123 .    a canonical way to generate such a joint triple is to generate @xmath60 according to @xmath119 and then generate @xmath61 conditionally independent of @xmath60 according to @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "now for any @xmath126 , using standard arguments from @xcite , there exists a @xmath127 with @xmath128 , such that @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "similarly , there exists a @xmath131 with @xmath132 , such that @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "from fact [ fa : cons ] , it follows that there exists a triple @xmath116 consistent with the pairs @xmath127 and @xmath135 .",
    "thus we can assume that @xmath136 .",
    "the outer bound of krner and marton @xcite is given by @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the set of rate pairs @xmath53 satisfying @xmath139 for some distribution @xmath140 , and @xmath141 is the set of rate pairs @xmath53 satisfying @xmath142 for some distribution @xmath143 .    from lemma [ le : obound2 ] , it is clear that @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "hence @xmath146 and @xmath62 is in general contained in the krner - marton outer bound . in the following section , we show that the containment is strict for the _ binary skew - symmetric _ broadcast channel .",
    "consider the binary skew - symmetric channel ( bssc ) shown in figure [ fig : bssc ] , which was studied by hajek and pursley @xcite .",

    "the resulting coding scheme has the following intuitive interpretation , which we denote by _ randomized time - sharing_. observe that if @xmath155 is sent , it is received error free by @xmath150 , but completely noisy by @xmath149 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath156 is sent , it is received error free by @xmath149 , but completely noisy by @xmath150 .",
    "this suggests that a time - sharing scheme , where transmission time is divided between the two user before communication commences , is optimal .",
    "it turned out that higher rates can be achieved by performing randomized time - sharing , instead .",
    "this is done via a _",
    "common information _ random variable @xmath157 , which specifies the locations of the symbols in the received sequence corresponding to each user s _ private message_. each receiver first decodes @xmath157 to find out which part of the received sequence corresponds to its private message , then proceeds to decode its private message . using standard random coding and joint typicality decoding arguments ,",
    "it is can be shown that any @xmath53 satisfying the conditions @xmath158 for some @xmath159 , is achievable .",
    "the line segment joining @xmath160 to @xmath161 is achieved by the following choice of @xmath162 .",
    "let @xmath163 , then @xmath164 it is not difficult to see that the line segment joining @xmath165 and @xmath161 lies on the boundary of this region .",
    "note that on this line segment @xmath166 .    we now show that the region @xmath62 , described by the outer bound , is strictly larger than the cover - van der meulen region @xmath167 and strictly smaller than the krner - marton outer bound .",
    "the line segment connecting @xmath168 to @xmath169 lies on the boundary of @xmath62 .",

    "assume that @xmath172 maximizes the sum rate and let @xmath173 consider a triple @xmath174 with @xmath175 , such that @xmath176    by the symmetry of the channel , @xmath177 therefore , @xmath178 let @xmath179 be an independent random variable that takes values 1 or 2 with equal probability and define @xmath180 and @xmath181 as @xmath182 and @xmath183 , respectively",
    ". then @xmath184    observe that @xmath185 @xmath186 where @xmath95 follows by the concavity of the entropy function .",
    "similarly @xmath187 therefore , @xmath188    now , by the construction of @xmath116 , @xmath189 .",
    "thus to compute @xmath190 , it suffices to consider @xmath60 such that @xmath191 .    using standard optimization techniques , it is not difficult to see that the following @xmath192 and @xmath193 maximize the terms @xmath194 and @xmath195 , respectively , subject to @xmath196 . as before ,",

    "the line segment joining @xmath168 to @xmath169 that lies on the boundary of @xmath62 is strictly outside the line segment joining @xmath165 to @xmath161 that lies on the boundary of the cover - van der meulen region @xmath154 @xcite .",
