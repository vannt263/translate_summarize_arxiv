    "quantum information theory has raised new questions related to the conventional quantum formalism .",
    "one particular idea is the minimal resource perspective .",
    "generally , the underlying question is the following .",
    "if we want to realize all devices of the given type and our methods are specified , what are those devices that allow one to construct all desired devices ?",
    "for instance , suppose we want to be able to prepare all pure states of a bipartite system .",
    "if we are able to prepare all maximally entangled pure states , then by means of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) we can prepare all pure states .",
    "these type of questions and their variants have been investigated extensively in the case of quantum states .",
    "similar minimal resource investigations of quantum measurements are less common . from the mathematical point of view , quantum measurements are described by positive operator valued measures ( povms ) and questions therefore reduce to the problems on the mathematical structure of povms .    in this work we concentrate on one type of minimal resource problem in the case of finite outcome povms on a finite dimensional system .",
    "if we can implement two povms , then we can implement their mixture by randomly alternating the measurements .",
    "an extremal povm corresponds to a measurement that can not be obtained as a mixture . for a qubit system",
    "all extremal povms are of rank-1 @xcite and one can thus restrict to rank-1 povms when searching for an optimal measurement for some task ( see e.g. @xcite ) . generally , however , there are extremal povms which are not rank-1 and their relevance is somewhat unclear , even if they have been mathematically characterized @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in this work",
    "we show that one can limit to extremal rank-1 povms , assuming that two simple procedures are permitted .",
    "it turns out that it is enough to allow another simple method than mixing ; this is called _",
    "relabeling_. we show that any povm can be obtained from extremal rank-1 povms with these two procedures of mixing and relabeling .",
    "this result summarizes the structure of povms in a very convenient and accesible way .",
    "we remark that some related results have been derived in @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown that any finite outcome povm on a finite dimensional system can be obtained from a rank-1 povm by a stochastic matrix .",
    "this procedure can be interpreted as a postprocessing of obtained measurement outcomes @xcite . in this context",
    ", relabeling is just a deterministic processing method , i.e. , the related stochastic matrix contains only entries @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "since a double stochastic matrix is a convex mixture of permutation matrices @xcite , one can easily see a connection between these two approaches .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that maximality in the postprocessing relation is physically more relevant than extremality .",
    "this may be the case , but we believe that a solid understanding of the extremal povms is important since in many problems one has to maximize a convex figure of merit . our aim in this work is to clarify the relations between all povms , extremal povms and extremal rank-1 povms .",
    "quantum measurements are generally described by positive operator valued measures ( povms ) . in this work",
    "we concentrate on measurements with finite number of outcomes . in sec .",

    "a povm is an assignment of an effect for each measurement outcome @xcite .",
    "the particular labeling of measurement outcomes is irrelevant for our investigation .",
    "we will therefore assume that the measurement outcomes are labeled by the integers @xmath6 .",
    "thus , a povm @xmath7 with @xmath8 outcomes is a function @xmath9 from the outcome set @xmath10 to the set of effects @xmath4 and it is required to satisfy the normalization condition @xmath11 .",
    "we remark that it is possible that @xmath12 for some @xmath13 .",
    "this simply means that the outcome @xmath13 is never registered .",
    "two povms that differ only by their number of zero operators are considered equivalent .    a special class of povms",

    "it follows that each @xmath14 is a one - dimensional projection @xcite .",
    "there are two basic procedures to obtain a new povm out of the given ones , relabeling and mixing .",
    "we will first consider some of their properties and then show that , if taken together , we can construct any povm from extremal rank-1 povms by using these two methods .      by _ relabeling _ we mean a procedure where the labels of the measurement outcomes are shuffled , possibly giving same label to several different outcomes .",
    "if the resulting effects are kept fixed or only the number of zero effects is modified , we consider the new povm to be equivalent to the initial povm . in particular , this kind of transformation is reversible since we can relabel the new povm again to get the initial povm back .    in irreversible transformations",

    "we are interested on extremal rank-1 povms , but we will comment more on different types of extremal povms in sec . [",
    "sec : example ] .",
    "let us first make some observations on extremal rank-1 povms .",
    "combining prop .",
    "[ prop : nd ] and prop .",
    "[ prop : basic ] we conclude that _ the number of nonzero outcomes @xmath8 of an extremal rank-1 povm is between @xmath3 and @xmath60 .",
    "_ it is easy to give examples of extremal rank-1 povms having the minimal number of outcomes @xmath17 .",
    "[ ex : pvm](_extremal rank-1 povm with @xmath3 outcomes _ ) fix an orthonormal basis @xmath74 for @xmath2 .",
    "we define a @xmath3-outcome povm @xmath7 by @xmath75 , and each effect @xmath14 is hence a one - dimensional projection .",
    "since @xmath7 is a pvm , it is extremal .",
    "alternatively , the extremality of @xmath7 can be concluded using prop .",
    "[ prop : basic ] ; if @xmath76 , then @xmath77 for every @xmath78 .",
    "hence @xmath79 .    using the previous example as an auxiliary result",
    ", we can prove the following .",
    "[ prop : exist ] for every @xmath8 satisfying @xmath80 , there exists an extremal rank-1 povm @xmath7 with @xmath8 outcomes .",
    "suppose the claim is true for a number @xmath8 satisfying @xmath81 .",
    "we show that the claim is then true also for @xmath82 .",
    "let @xmath7 be an extremal rank-1 povm @xmath7 with @xmath83 outcomes .",
    "since @xmath83 , the real linear span @xmath84 of the effects @xmath46 is a proper subset of the real linear space of selfadjoint operators . therefore , there exists a nonzero selfadjoint operator @xmath85 which is not in @xmath84 .",
    "the operator @xmath85 has a spectral decomposition @xmath86 , and at least one of the spectral projections @xmath87 is not in @xmath84 since otherwise @xmath85 would be in @xmath84 .",
    "we can thus choose a one - dimensional projection @xmath88 which is not in @xmath84 and we denote @xmath89",
    ". then @xmath90 is positive and invertible , hence it has invertible square root @xmath91 .",
    "we define @xmath92 the resulting povm @xmath22 is rank-1 and the effects @xmath93 are linearly independent .",
    "the claim now follows from this consideration combined with example [ ex : pvm ] .",
    "we have seen that by starting from a @xmath3-outcome extremal rank-1 povm , we can construct extremal rank-1 povms with any allowed number of outcomes . in the following example",
    "we demonstrate the method used in the proof of prop . [",
    "prop : exist ] .",
    "[ ex : qubit-1 ] we take @xmath94 and construct a three - outcome extremal rank-1 povm from a two - outcome extremal rank-1 povm . by prop .",
    "[ prop : nd ] a rank-1 povm @xmath7 with two outcomes is necessarily a pvm . let us consider @xmath7 with @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "using the same notations as in the proof of prop .",
    "[ prop : exist ] , we can choose @xmath97 and this gives @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "the resulting extremal povm @xmath22 is therefore @xmath100 this is extremal by construction , and one can also directly verify that the effects are rank-1 and linearly independent .      as we have recalled in subsec .",
    "[ sec : mix ] , the number of outcomes of extremal rank-1 povms ranges from @xmath3 to @xmath60 and the extremality criterion is simply the linear independence of its effects .    in general ,",
    "the extremality criterion is the following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : let @xmath7 be a povm with nonzero effects @xmath14 , @xmath58 .",
    "we can write @xmath101 where the vectors @xmath102 , @xmath103 , are nonzero and orthogonal",
    ". then @xmath7 is extremal if and only if the operators @xmath104 for @xmath58 and @xmath105 are linearly independent .",
    "we conclude that the set of all extremal rank-1 povms is much more tractable and easier to handle than the set of all extremal povms",
    ". it would be therefore desirable to concentrate only on extremal rank-1 povms , but then one has to justify this limitation in some way .",
    "the following two results show that we can restrict to extremal rank-1 povms if we are allowed to perform their relabeling and mixing .",
    "[ th : every ] every povm can be obtained from extremal rank-1 observables by mixing and relabeling .",
    "let @xmath7 be a @xmath8-outcome povm . by prop .",
    "[ prop : relabel ] there is a rank-1 povm @xmath27 such that @xmath7 is a relabeling of @xmath27 .",
    "if the effects of @xmath27 are linearly independent , then @xmath27 is extremal and the claim is true .",
    "hence , we concentrate on the case that the effects of @xmath27 are linearly dependent .",
    "if a rank-1 observable @xmath27 has @xmath106 nonzero outcomes and the corresponding effects are linearly dependent , then we can write @xmath27 as a mixture of two observables @xmath107 and @xmath108 , both consisting of ( at most ) @xmath109 nonzero rank-1 effects .",
    "the proof is similar as in prop .",
    "[ prop : basic ] ; the linear dependence means that @xmath110 for some coefficients @xmath49 which are not all zeroes .",
    "choosing similarly as in formulas - , we can write @xmath27 as a mixture of two different povms @xmath107 and @xmath108 , both having at most @xmath109 nonzero effects",
    ". all their nonzero effects are rank-1 since all nonzero effects of @xmath27 are rank-1 .",
    "if @xmath107 or @xmath108 consist of linearly dependent effects , we continue this procedure .",
    "since the number of nonzero effects is always decreased by one , the process has to terminate .",
    "we end up with extremal rank-1 povms .",
    "let us remark that the proof of theorem [ th : every ] shows that to implement a given povm @xmath7 which is not extremal rank-1 , we first mix and then relabel .",
    "namely , in the first step we mix two or more extremal rank-1 povms to obtain a povm with more outcomes than @xmath7 . in the second step we relabel the measurement outcomes in a suitable way and in this way obtain @xmath7 .",
    "as one would expect , the first step of mixing is not needed if the desired povm @xmath7 is extremal .",
    "( this is perhaps not transparent from theorem [ th : every ] since mixing is used only as an intermediate step . ) we have the following result .",
    "[ th : every - ext ] every extremal povm is either rank-1 or a relabeling of an extremal rank-1 povm .",
    "assume that @xmath7 is an extremal povm with nonzero effects @xmath14 , @xmath58 .",
    "we write each @xmath14 in the form .",
    "the extremality of @xmath7 is equivalent to the fact that the operators @xmath111 , @xmath58 , @xmath112 , are linearly independent .",
    "we define a rank-1 povm @xmath27 by @xmath113 where @xmath58 , @xmath103 .",
    "obviously @xmath7 is a relabeling of @xmath27 .",
    "since the effects @xmath114 are linearly independent , @xmath27 is extremal .",
    "theorem [ th : every - ext ] indicates that we can produce other extremal povms from an extremal rank-1 povm by relabeling its outcomes .",
    "however , we emphasize that not every relabeling leads to an extremal povm .",
    "for instance , if we start from the three - outcome povm @xmath22 written in example [ ex : qubit-1 ] and relabel it to obtain a two - outcome povm , then the resulting povm is not extremal . on the other hand ,",
    "if we start from any pvm , then its arbitrary relabeling is still a pvm and therefore extremal .",
    "the extremality condition , rephrased in , can be used to decide whether a given povm is extremal or not .",
    "however , it leaves open whether there is a simpler characterization of extremal elements .",
    "first of all , we have two basic types of extremal povms :    * a rank-1 povm with linearly independent elements ; * a pvm ( of any rank ) .",
    "a third type is a hybrid of the previous ones :    * a povm such that each effect @xmath14 is either a projection or a rank-1 operator , and the the operators @xmath46 are linearly independent .",
    "it is easy to verify that all povms of ( c)-type are extremal .",
    "( a slight modification of the proof of prop . [ prop : basic]b works ) . clearly , ( a ) and ( b ) are just special instances of ( c ) .",
    "we also recall that for @xmath73 every extremal povm is rank-1 @xcite , i.e. , in this case there are only ( a)-type extremal povms .",
    "the obvious question is : are all extremal povms of the ( c)-type ? in the following we demonstrate that this is not the case",
    ". hence , there exists    * an extremal povm which is not ( c)-type .",
    "our example uses a hilbert space @xmath2 with @xmath115 , but with a small modification one can generate a similar example also in all higher dimensions .    [",
    "ex : d ] denote the third roots of 1 by @xmath116 , @xmath117 , i.e. @xmath118 . consider the case @xmath119 and pick an orthonormal basis @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "define operators @xmath122 , @xmath117 , @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 , @xmath117 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the assignment @xmath126 defines a povm .",
    "the extremality characterization states that @xmath7 is extremal iff the operators @xmath127 , @xmath128 @xmath117 , are linearly independent .",

    "in this section we make some remarks that are related to povms on infinite outcome set .",
    "these observations are more technical than the previous results .",
