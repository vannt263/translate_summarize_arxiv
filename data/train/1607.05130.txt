    "the integration of millimeter - wave ( mmwave ) and massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) has been considered as a key technique for future 5 g wireless communications  @xcite , since it can achieve significant increase in data rates due to its wider bandwidth and higher spectral efficiency .    however , realizing mmwave massive mimo in practice is not a trivial task .",
    "one key challenging problem is that each antenna in mimo systems usually requires one dedicated radio - frequency ( rf ) chain ( including digital - to - analog converter , up converter , etc . ) .",
    "this results in unaffordable hardware complexity and energy consumption in mmwave massive mimo systems , as the number of antennas becomes huge  @xcite and the energy consumption of rf chain is high at mmwave frequencies  @xcite . to reduce the number of required rf chains , the concept of beamspace mimo has been recently proposed in the pioneering work  @xcite . by employing the lens antenna array instead of the conventional electromagnetic antenna array",
    ", beamspace mimo can transform the conventional spatial channel into beamspace channel by concentrating the signals from different directions ( beams ) on different antennas  @xcite . since the scattering in mmwave communications is not rich ,",
    "the number of effective prorogation paths is quite limited  @xcite , occupying only a small number of beams . as a result ,",
    "the mmwave beamspace channel is sparse  @xcite , and we can select a small number of dominant beams to significantly reduce the dimension of mimo system and the number of required rf chains without obvious performance loss  @xcite .    nevertheless , beam selection requires the base station ( bs ) to acquire the information of beamspace channel of large size , which is challenging , especially when the number of rf chains is limited . to solve this problem",
    ", some advanced schemes based on compressive sensing ( cs ) have been proposed very recently  @xcite .",
    "the key idea of these schemes is to utilize the sparsity of mmwave channels in the angle domain to efficiently estimate the mmwave massive mimo channel of large size .",
    "however , these schemes are designed for hybrid precoding systems  @xcite , where the phase shifter network can generate beams with sufficiently high angle resolution to improve the channel estimation accuracy . by contrast , in beamspace mimo systems , although the phase shifter network can be replaced by lens antenna array to further reduce the hardware cost and energy consumption , the generated beams are predefined with a fixed yet limited angle resolution .",
    "if we directly apply the existing channel estimation schemes to beamspace mimo systems with lens antenna array , the performance will be not very satisfying  @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the channel estimation problem for beamspace mimo systems has not been well addressed in the literature .    in this paper , by fully utilizing the structural characteristics of mmwave beamspace channel , we propose a reliable support detection ( sd)-based channel estimation scheme .",
    "the basic idea is to decompose the total beamspace channel estimation problem into a series of sub - problems , each of which only considers one sparse channel component ( a vector containing the information of a specific propagation direction ) . for each channel component",
    ", we first detect its support ( i.e. , the index set of nonzero elements in a sparse vector ) according to the estimated position of the strongest element .",
    "then , the influence of this channel component is removed from the total beamspace channel estimation problem , and the support of the next channel component is detected in a similar method .",
    "after the supports of all channel components have been detected , the nonzero elements of the sparse beamspace channel can be estimated with low pilot overhead .",
    "simulation results show that the proposed sd - based channel estimation outperforms conventional schemes , especially in the low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) region , which is more attractive for mmwave massive mimo systems where low snr is the typical case before beamforming  @xcite .",

    "unfortunately , acquiring the beamspace channel of large size in practice is challenging , especially when the number of rf chains is limited .",
    "in this section , based on the beamspace mimo architecture , we first introduce a pilot transmission strategy . after that",

    "finally , a sd - based channel estimation is proposed to estimate the beamspace channel with limited number of rf chains and low pilot overhead .      to estimate the beamspace channel , in the uplink of tdd systems , all users need to transmit the known pilot sequences to the bs over @xmath58 instants ( each user transmits one pilot symbol in each instant ) for channel estimation , and we assume that the beamspace channel remains unchanged within such channel coherence time ( i.e. , @xmath58 instants )  @xcite . in this paper",

    "moreover , due to the limited number of dominant scatters in the mmwave prorogation environments  @xcite , @xmath78 is a sparse vector . therefore ,  ( [ eq15 ] ) can be formulated as a typical sparse signal recovery problem  @xcite .",
    "our next target is to design the analog combiner @xmath88 . under the framework of cs , to achieve the satisfying recovery accuracy , @xmath88 should be designed to make the mutual coherence @xmath93 as small as possible , where @xmath94 is the @xmath33th column of @xmath88 .",
    "there are already some matrices that have been proved to enjoy small @xmath95 , such as the i.i.d .",

    "this is due to the facts that : i ) all elements of @xmath88 share the same normalized amplitude , which can be realized by phase shifters ; ii ) the resolution of phase shifter can be only 1 bit , since we only need to shift the phases 0 degree and @xmath97 degree .",
    "this means that the cost and energy consumption of the phase shifter network can be significantly reduced  @xcite .",
    "after @xmath88 has been designed by the proposed adaptive selecting network ,  ( [ eq15 ] ) can be solved by classical cs algorithms , such as orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) and compressive sampling matching pursuit ( cosamp )  @xcite . however , when the uplink snr is low , which is the typical case in mmwave massive mimo systems due to the lack of beamforming gain and the low transmit power of users  @xcite , @xmath98 will be overwhelmed by noise . as a result ,",
    "the support of @xmath98 detected by classical cs algorithms is usually inaccurate , leading to the deteriorated performance . in this paper , by utilizing the structural characteristics of mmwave beamspace channel , we propose a sd - based channel estimation , which can detect the support more accurately and achieve better performance than classical cs algorithms , especially in the low snr region .    in the following * lemma 1 *",

    "* lemma 1 * implies that we can decompose the total beamspace channel estimation problem into a series of independent sub - problems , each of which only considers one specific channel component approximately orthogonal to the others .",
    "specifically , we can first estimate the strongest channel component .",

    "this means that we can retain only a small number ( e.g. , @xmath129 ) of elements of @xmath114 with strong power and regard other elements as zero without obvious performance loss .",
    "the second one is that the support of sparse vector @xmath114 can be uniquely determined by @xmath119 as is odd , the support of @xmath114 should be @xmath130 . ]",

    "based on the discussion so far , the pseudo - code of the proposed sd - based channel estimation can be summarized in * * algorithm 1 * * , which can be explained as follows . during the @xmath33th iteration",
    ", we first detect the position @xmath137 of the strongest element of @xmath114 in step 1 .",
    "then in step 2 , utilizing the structural characteristics of beamspace channel as analyzed above , we can directly obtain @xmath138 according to  ( [ eq24 ] ) .",
    "after that , the nonzero elements of @xmath114 are estimated by ls algorithm in step 3 , and the influence of this channel component is removed in steps 4 and 5 . such procedure will be repeated ( @xmath139 in step 6 ) until the last channel component is considered . note that for the proposed sd - based channel estimation , we do not directly estimate the beamspace channel as @xmath140 .",
    "this is because that most of the elements with small power are regarded as zero , which will lead to error propagation in the influence removal , especially when @xmath33 is large . as a result",
