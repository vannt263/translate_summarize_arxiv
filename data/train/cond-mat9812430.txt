    "an important feature of many low - dimensional models of strongly interacting electrons is that they exhibit quantum phase transitions , i.e. , they undergo a phase transition at zero temperature as some parameter is varied.@xcite experimental realization of this occurs in heavy fermion materials such as cecu@xmath2au@xmath3 which undergo an antiferromagnetic - paramagnetic phase transition induced by pressure.@xcite near the critical point unconventional metallic behaviour is observed and is enhanced by the presence of disorder.@xcite it has also been proposed that a quantum critical point plays an important role in cuprate superconductors.@xcite quantum phase transitions in the presence of impurities or disorder also occur in @xmath4he and @xmath5he absorbed in porous media ,  @xcite superconductor - insulator transitions in dirty thin films ,  @xcite the delocalization transition in the quantum hall effect and the metal - insulator transition in doped semiconductors .  @xcite    compared to thermal phase transitions in disorder - free systems these transitions are poorly understood because many of the theoretical methods ( e.g. , exact solutions , the renormalization group and @xmath6 expansions ) that have proven so useful for pure systems at non - zero temperatures@xcite are difficult to implement for disordered systems .",
    "@xcite these phase transitions are associated with particularly rich physics such as large differences between average and typical ( i.e. , most probable ) behaviour , new universality classes , logarithmic scaling and `` griffiths phases '' ,  @xcite in which susceptibilities diverge even though there are only short - range correlations .",
    "low energy properties of the system are dominated by extremely rare configurations of the system .",
    "it has recently been proposed that griffiths phases can lead to unconventional metallic behaviour.@xcite    fisher recently made an exhaustive study of the effect of randomness on what is arguably the simplest model to undergo a quantum phase transition : the transverse field ising spin chain .",
    "@xcite he used a real space renormalization group decimation technique ( rsrgdt ) , originally developed by dasgupta and ma ,  @xcite which he claimed is exact near the critical point .",
    "fisher found the phase diagram ( which included a griffiths phase near the critical point ) , all of the critical exponents ( some of which are irrational , as shown in table [ table0 ] ) and scaling functions for the magnetization and correlation functions in an external field .",
    "it is striking that the latter have never been derived for the disorder - free case but can be derived in the presence of disorder because distributions become extremely broad near the critical point .",
    "many of fisher s results have been confirmed by numerical work .",
    "@xcite the rsrgdt has now also been used to study the effect of disorder on dimerized  @xcite and anisotropic spin-@xmath7 chains , spin-1 chains ,  @xcite chains with random spin sizes ,  @xcite quantum potts and clock chains ,  @xcite and diffusion in a random environment .",
    "@xcite possible experimental realizations of random spin chains are given in table [ table0 ] .",
    "there is a direct connection between the critical behaviour of the random transverse field ising chain and random walks in a disordered environment .  @xcite",
    "fisher s results have also been related to the kondo lattice in one dimension .",
    "@xcite    an important question is whether some of the same interesting physics occurs in higher dimensional models .",
    "senthil and sachdev did find this to be the case in a dilute quantum ising system near a percolation transition.@xcite it is particularly interesting that some of the most striking features that fisher found in the one - dimensional model ( a variable dynamical critical exponent which diverges at the critical point and the average and typical correlations are associated with different critical exponents ) have recently been found in the two - dimensional random transverse field ising model.@xcite    the outline of the paper is as follows . in section ii",
    "we introduce the model , an anisotropic xy spin chain in a transverse field , where all the exchange integrals and transverse field are random .",
    "a similar model was also recently studied numerically using the density - matrix renormalization group.@xcite a jordan - wigner transformation is then used to map the model onto a non - interacting fermion model .",
    "section iii contains a brief summary of the known properties of the disorder - free model that are needed to understand the rest of the paper . in section",
    "iv we take the continuum limit of the fermion model for various cases . the ising transition and the anisotropy transition with only randomness in the anisotropy that results in a dirac equation with a random mass . the isotropic xx chain in a transverse field with randomness in the exchange and/or transverse field",
    "reduces to a dirac equation with a random complex mass .",
    "mapping the spin chain to these dirac equations has the advantage that a number of different exact analytic techniques can then be used to evaluate the density of states and the localization length .",
    "the properties of the solutions corresponding to the universality class of the random transverse field ising model are then discussed in section v. by examining the energy dependence of the density of states we evaluate the dynamical critical exponent , show the existence of a griffiths phase near the transition , and show that the ground state energy has an essential singularity at the transition .",
    "we also present results for thermodynamic properties and the typical correlation length .",
    "the results obtained for the dynamical critical exponent , typical correlation length , and for the temperature dependence of the specific heat near the ising transition agree with the results of the rsrgdt and numerical work . since our approach is explicitly exact our results are consistent with fisher s",
    "claim that the rsrgdt gives exact results for critical properties . in section",
    "vi we point out that the properties of the incommensurate solution are such that it implies that the anisotropy transition is destroyed in a non - zero transverse field if there is randomness in the isotropic exchange or in the transverse field . a brief report of some of the results presented here appeared previously.@xcite",
