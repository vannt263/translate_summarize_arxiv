    "the gravitational wave ( gw ) community is currently exploring strategies to overcome the quantum limited sensitivity of next generation gw interferometers .",
    "one of the most promising techniques is the injection of squeezed fields into the antisymmetric ( dark ) port of the gw interferometers  @xcite .",
    "future gw interferometers will use higher circulating power to reduce shot noise at high frequencies , but this increase in power makes the radiation pressure noise significant at low frequencies .",
    "the effect of the radiation pressure noise is to ponderomotively squeeze the optical fields with a frequency dependent ( fd ) squeeze angle due to the fd response of the test masses  @xcite .",
    "this presents difficulty in injecting squeezed states into the interferometer because the squeeze angle of the squeezed state source must be matched to the ponderomotive squeeze angle .",
    "squeezed state sources are generally frequency independent , but the desired angle may be produced by using optical cavities placed between the squeezed state source and the interferometer as filters . both filters that rotate the squeeze angle to match the ponderomotive squeeze angle  @xcite and filters that attenuate the anti - squeezing in a desired band  @xcite have been proposed .",
    "the attenuation filters operate on the principle that the squeezed state with a frequency independent squeeze angle has beneficial effects over some frequency band , but harmful effects over other frequency bands , and those harmful effects can be mitigated by introducing a fd optical loss .",
    "the previously proposed cavity filters  @xcite , while producing the desired effects , are difficult to build because they require cavities with narrow linewidths comparable to the bandwidth of the interferometer ( @xmath0 ) , which require either kilometer - scale cavities , or high finesse cavities . for squeeze angle rotation ,",
    "high finesse cavities are somewhat undesirable due to high optical losses .",
    "for example , assuming a round trip optical loss of @xmath1 , a cavity would have to be nearly @xmath2 to maintain an effective loss of @xmath3 or less . in this paper , we propose alternative filter designs based on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) media , for both attenuation and rotation , that do not require long or high finesse cavities , and also have increased tunability .",
    "several properties of eit media make them a potentially advantageous alternative to ultralow - loss or km - scale optical cavities .",
    "first , eit media typically have narrow transmission resonance linewidths ; the narrowest linewidth reported is @xmath4  hz in a paraffin coated cell with @xmath5rb as the eit medium  @xcite",
    ". the eit media can also be very compact , with typical lengths of @xmath6  cm .",
    "second , the resonance linewidth may be adjusted in non - invasive ways , by changing the atomic density  @xcite or drive field intensity  @xcite , to optimize the filtering . altering the linewidth of an optical cavity ,",
    "on the other hand , usually requires changing the transmission of the mirrors or the macroscopic cavity length .",
    "other variable reflectivity techniques , e.g. , three - mirror cavities , are possible , but issues of fringe control , scattered light and mode mismatch are compounded in such systems .",
    "third , eit media can be nearly 100% transmissive for the probe field  @xcite .",
    "fourth , mode matching of the spatial mode of the squeezed ( probe ) beam to that of the eit is not critical , as it is for an optical cavity , where mode mismatch can be a significant source of optical loss  . fifth , eit media have also been shown to preserve squeezed states in transmission  @xcite .",
    "these reasons lead naturally to consideration of using eit for squeezed state filters .",
    "( a ) a generic three - level eit system .",
    "the susceptibility of the eit medium , @xmath7 , is a function of the frequency of the probe field , @xmath8 , the sideband frequency , @xmath9 ( relative to the carrier frequency of the probe , @xmath8 ) , the frequency of ground state splitting , @xmath10 , the two - photon detuning of the probe field , @xmath11 , the one - photon detuning of the drive field , @xmath12 , and the length of the eit medium , @xmath13 .",
    "( b ) a proposed configuration for a squeeze eit filter and gw interferometer , where sqz : squeezed field generator ; eit : eit filter ; ifo : gw interferometer ; cir : circulator ; pd : photodetector . ]    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sect : theory ] we develop the theoretical formulation of how an eit medium gives rise to squeeze state attenuation and squeeze angle rotation , and we derive the quadrature noise at the output of an example gravitational wave interferometer for a generic input squeezed state ; in section  [ sect : eit ] we analyze three different cases of eit filtering of the input squeezed state and derive the quantum noise limited sensitivity of the gw interferometer for each case ; we summarize our findings in section  [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we relate the general properties of the eit medium , as described by a complex transmission coefficient , to the propagation of the squeezed state , in terms of rotation and attenuation .",
    "we then apply this formulation to the output of a gw interferometer .",
    "the energy level scheme for one photon resonant eit is shown in figure  [ fig : fig1](a ) . using the parameters defined in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , the eit transmission as a function of the sideband frequency , @xmath9 ,",
    "is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the wave vector of the probe field through the eit medium .",
    "for most cases , it is reasonable to assume that the susceptibility of the medium @xmath16 and @xmath17 , then the wave vector can be written as @xmath18 in the frequency domain , substituting eq .   into eq .   and",
    "moving into the rotating frame of the probe field , @xmath19 , with frequency , @xmath8  @xcite , we find the eit transmission at sideband frequencies , @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 here @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the real and imaginary parts of @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath23 is responsible for phase shift and @xmath24 is responsible for signal strength attenuation .    when the input field , @xmath19 , is injected into an eit medium , the output field , @xmath26 , and its adjoint , @xmath27 , are given in terms of @xmath19 and its adjoint , @xmath28 , by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the eit absorption coefficient such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 is a vacuum field coupled in by the absorption loss .",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 satisfy the commutation relations @xmath35 = 2\\pi\\delta(\\omega-\\omega^{'}),\\ ] ] and all others vanish ( similarly for @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) . in the two - photon representation ,",
    "the amplitude and phase quadratures of @xmath19 are defined as @xmath38 respectively ( similarly for @xmath26 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "we find the amplitude and phase quadrature fields of the output , in compact matrix form , to be @xmath39 where we use the two - photon matrix representation @xmath40 for the operator , @xmath19 ( and similarly for @xmath26 and @xmath32 ) , and @xmath41 is a matrix representing propagation through the eit medium .",
    "@xmath42 comprises an overall phase shift , @xmath43 , rotation by angle , @xmath44 , and attenuation by a factor , @xmath45 .",
    "here we have defined @xmath46 and performed a unitary transformation on @xmath47 , such that @xmath48 and @xmath49 behaves as ordinary unsqueezed vacuum . for symmetrical lineshapes with respect to the carrier ,",
    "@xmath50 , and @xmath44 therefore vanishes , giving no quadrature angle rotation , but attenuating the signal strength . for asymmetrical lineshapes ,",
    "nonzero @xmath44 gives quadrature angle rotation .",
    "for a conventional gw interferometer with arm lengths @xmath51 and mirror masses @xmath52 , the fourier transform @xmath53 of the optical noise in the gw strain signal when a ( eit - filtered ) squeezed field @xmath54 is injected into the dark port is given by  @xcite @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the effective coupling constant that relates motion of the mirrors to the output signal . here",
    "@xmath57 is the linewidth of the arm cavities ( typically @xmath58 hz ) , @xmath8 is the carrier frequency of the incident laser light , and @xmath59 is the laser power at the beam - splitter .    assuming no losses other than those associated with the eit filter , a squeezed state with squeeze factor @xmath60 and squeeze angle @xmath61 is injected into the antisymmetric port of the gw interferometer through the eit filter [ see figure  [ fig : fig1](b ) ] .",
    "the input angle @xmath62 may be arbitrarily chosen by microscopic variations in the distance between the squeezed state source and the interferometer .",
    "the spectral density of the noise at the output of the gw interferometer is then @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "here @xmath65 is the effective ponderomotive squeeze angle of the interferometer , and the noise in the anti - squeezed and squeezed quadratures , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , is given by @xmath68",
    "in this section , we propose three kinds of eit filters : ( i ) low - pass , band - pass , and high - pass squeeze amplitude attenuation filters , ( ii ) an s - shaped filter as a frequency - dependent squeeze angle rotator , and ( iii ) an intra - cavity eit filter as a frequency - dependent squeeze angle rotator .        to obtain expressions for the eit transmission @xmath69 , it is useful to use the following formulae for eit susceptibility , @xmath7  @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the eit resonance linewidth and the coefficients @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 depend on the intensity and detuning , @xmath12 , of the drive field . the first term on the right hand side in eq",
    ".   corresponds to asymmetric phase dependence on the two - photon detuning @xmath75 and the second term is responsible for symmetrical lorentzian dependence .",
    "similarly , the first term in eq .   corresponds to symmetrical dependence on the absorption coefficient of the eit medium , the second term indicates asymmetric absorption , and the third term corresponds to broadband absorption in the medium .",
    "inserting eqs .   and into eqs .   and",
    ", we get explicit expressions for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , which are used calculate the noise at the output of the gw interferometer @xmath78 , as described in section  [ sect : gwi ] .      if we take @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 @xcite , then @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 , and we obtain a symmetric eit transmission line with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this can be used as a squeeze amplitude filter that retains squeezing at low frequencies , but causes ordinary ( unsqueezed ) vacuum to replace the anti - squeezed noise at higher frequencies that are outside the eit bandwidth .",
    "this is equivalent to the low - pass filters proposed in  @xcite .",
    "similarly , buffer gas induced electromagnetically induced absorption ( bgieia )  @xcite may be used as a high - pass filter .",
    "bgieia is similar to eit , with a narrowband _ absorption _ resonance instead of the transmission resonance of eit .",
    "high - pass filtering with bgieia can be realized with parameters @xmath89 , @xmath80 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , such that @xmath92 for @xmath84 and @xmath83 for @xmath86 . a combination of two eit resonances , equally detuned from the carrier ( obtained by zeeman splitting  @xcite ) , serves as a band - pass filter . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] the effect of low - pass , band - pass , and high - pass eit filters on the noise spectral density of a gw interferometer are shown by the curves labelled `` low pass '' ( red ) , `` band pass '' ( dark green ) , and `` high pass '' ( cyan ) , respectively .",
    "the noise spectra are normalized by the noise spectral density of a conventional interferometer with no squeezed state injection , which corresponds to the unity in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] . in each case , the harmful effects of squeezing with a constant squeeze angle are reduced .",
    "the filters discussed so far only provide attenuation of the squeezing , they do not produce any squeeze angle rotation .",
    "we now introduce two cases of eit that also produce squeeze angle rotation .      in principle , optimum squeeze angle rotation , corresponding to @xmath93 , can be obtained with an asymmetrical  or s - shaped ",
    "eit filter , realized under conditions similar to bgieia with parameters @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 . in this case",
    ", the noise spectral density can be optimized over most frequencies .",
    "however , as is evident from the curves labelled `` s resonance '' ( brown and blue ) in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] , the improvement is small because of the high off - resonance losses associated with the coefficient @xmath74 ; optimization would require setting @xmath90 .",
    "the noise is decreased at both high and low frequencies , but worsened in the middle of the band due to two effect .",
    "first , the imbalance in absorption ( @xmath97 ) between the upper and lower sidebands required to obtain the squeeze angle rotation causes the quadratures to be mixed and the noise may be higher than shot noise .",
    "second , the imperfect squeeze angle rotation , @xmath93 , couples in noise from the anti - squeezed quadrature .      placing an eit medium in an optical cavity",
    "narrows the cavity linewidth  @xcite .",
    "we consider a symmetric eit transmission resonance , such as the one used for our low - pass filter , with a large linewidth @xmath98 , such that @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 in the frequency band of interest ( 100hz ) . this configuration may be understood in terms of the group velocity of the light through the eit medium @xmath102 we",
    "may then express @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the effective cavity length .",
    "the eit medium serves as an additional delay line inside the cavity . a group velocity as low as 8  m / s in a 12 cm long rb vapor cell was demonstrated by budker _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , giving an effective length on the order of @xmath105 .",
    "to use intra - cavity eit as a squeeze angle rotation filter , we must detune the cavity ( but not the eit medium ) from the carrier . for this case ,",
    "the rotation arises from the detuned cavity , similar to the filters in ref .",
    "@xcite , and not from the eit .",
    "the eit acts only to modify the resonant linewidth of the cavity by increasing its effective length . to achieve the required @xmath106  hz linewidth for the filter",
    ", we use an eit with a large effective length , combined with a short cavity .",
    "the performance of this cavity is essentially identical to that of an isolated cavity with no eit and length equal to @xmath107 , and may achieve optimal squeeze angle rotation with a much smaller optical loss than a traditional cavity of the same linewidth with the same real ( not effective ) length , giving improved gw interferometer sensitivity at all frequencies .",
    "we note that @xmath108 is a reasonable approximation because of the narrowed linewidth of the system ( @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the transmission of the cavity input mirror ) .",
    "detailed calculations show that the effective loss of the system may even be reduced by placing the eit in a shorter cavity for some parameter choices .",
    "the broadband reduction of noise from such an intra - cavity eit filter is shown in the curve labelled `` intra - cavity eit '' ( black ) in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] , and corresponds exactly to the much coveted _ optimal frequency - dependent squeezing _ of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have shown that frequency - dependent squeeze amplitude attenuation and squeeze angle rotation by eit can improve the sensitivity of gw interferometers .",
    "we find that the eit filters perform the same functions as previous filter designs , but may be easier to implement , due to lower optical losses , compactness , and easy linewidth tunability .",
    "while suitable eit media for the 1064 nm transition  the wavelength of laser light in present gw interferometers  have not yet been identified , we note that the ideal wavelength for future gw interferometers may well be determined by availability of high - power lasers , low - absorption optical materials , squeezed light sources , high quantum efficiency photodetectors , and perhaps eit filters .",
