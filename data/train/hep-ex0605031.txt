    "from perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , it is expected that both @xmath10 and @xmath1 decaying into light hadrons are dominated by the annihilation of @xmath11 into three gluons , with widths proportional to the square of the wave function at the origin @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "this yields the pqcd `` @xmath13 rule '' @xmath14 the violation of this rule was first observed in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 decay modes by mark - ii  @xcite .",
    "following the scenario proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the small @xmath17 branching fraction is due to the cancellation of the @xmath18- and @xmath19-wave matrix elements in @xmath1 decays , it was suggested that all @xmath1 decay channels should be affected by the same @xmath18- and @xmath19-wave mixing scheme , and thus all ratios of branching fractions of @xmath1 and @xmath10 decays into the same final state could have values different from @xmath13 , expected between pure @xmath20 and @xmath21 states  @xcite .",

    "however , our knowledge on @xmath8 resonances is still poor . even for the well - established lowest excited state , the @xmath23 , properties such as mass , width , and decay branching fractions still have large experimental uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "another outstanding problem is that , in many of its forms , the quark model predicts a substantial number of @xmath8 states around 2 @xmath24 , which have not yet been observed  @xcite .",
    "recent studies of @xmath8 resonances have been performed using @xmath25 events collected at the beijing electron - positron collider ( bepc )  @xcite , providing a new method for probing this physics , and a new @xmath8 peak with a mass at around 2065 @xmath26 was observed  @xcite .",
