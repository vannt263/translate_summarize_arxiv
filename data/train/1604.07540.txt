    ", many existing papers assume that the agents have strict preferences over individual objects .",
    "although strictness of preferences is natural restriction , it can not model preferences in which an agent is completely indifferent among some objects because they have the same quality that the agent cares about .",
    "the most famous mechanism for the problem is _ random serial dictatorship ( rsd ) _ : a permutation of the agents is chosen uniformly at random and then agents in the permutation are given the most preferred object that is still not allocated .",
    "although rsd is strategyproof in the strongest sense and also ex post efficient ( the outcome can be represented as convex combination of deterministic pareto optimal outcomes ) , @xcite showed that rsd is not sd - efficient even for strict preferences where sd - efficiency is a stronger property than ex post efficiency .",
    "they proposed a rival mechanism called _ probabilistic serial ( ps ) _ that is anonymous , neutral , sd - efficient , and weak sd-strategyproof.under ps , agents ` eat ' the most favoured available object at an equal rate until all the objects are consumed .",
    "when a most preferred object is completely eaten , agents eat their next most preferred object that is not completely eaten .",
    "the fraction of object consumed by an agent is the probability of the agent getting that object .",
