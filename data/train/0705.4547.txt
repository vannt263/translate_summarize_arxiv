    "the standard model ( sm ) has been successful in explaining almost all the observations at the accelerator experiments so far , which makes it a challenge to look for signals of new physics .",
    "apart from the direct searches for new particles at colliders , tests of the low energy predictions of the sm can also provide indirect signatures of the physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) . in the domain of flavour physics in particular ,",
    "such low energy observables include the branching ratios of various @xmath12 decay modes , the extent of cp violation in these decays , as well as the oscillation parameters of neutral @xmath12 meson systems @xcite .",
    "the data from the @xmath12 factories and the tevatron have already played a crucial role in constraining the nature and extent of bsm physics .    in this paper",
    "we shall concentrate on the oscillation parameters in the @xmath14 as well as @xmath15 systems . for convenience",
    ", we shall refer to the labels @xmath16 and @xmath17 collectively as @xmath18 .",
    "the average lifetimes @xmath19 , mass differences @xmath20 , lifetime differences @xmath21 , as well as cp asymmetries @xmath22 with @xmath23 $ ] offer incisive probes of new physics . here the labels @xmath24 and @xmath25 stand respectively for the light and heavy mass eigenstates in the neutral @xmath0 system .",
    "the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 have already been measured to an accuracy of better than @xmath28 @xcite and play an important role in constraining any new physics .",
    "the remaining quantities , on the other hand , currently have large errors and their accurate measurements act as tests of the sm . the value of @xmath29 , for example , which is predicted to be @xmath30 in the sm , can be enhanced significantly with many bsm physics models @xcite and a measurement in excess of the sm prediction would vouch for the presence of new physics .",
    "the sm predicts the lifetime differences in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 system to be @xcite @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , @xmath35 being suppressed with respect to @xmath36 by a factor of @xmath37 .",
    "the measurement of the latter is within the capability of lhcb , whereas that of the former is very difficult even at the super-@xmath12 factories due to its extremely small value .",
    "the large theoretical uncertainties in the sm predictions for these two quantities make them rather unsuitable for the detection of bsm physics , unless such physics changes the value of @xmath11 beyond the sm uncertainties . the so - called `` grossman theorem '' states",
    "that new physics can only decrease the value of @xmath36 @xcite , and the result extended to the @xmath31 system @xcite implies that @xmath35 can increase at the most by 20% with bsm contributions .",
    "this would seem to make the measurements of @xmath38 rather unappealing from the point of view of detecting new physics .",
    "however , the grossman theorem , and its extension mentioned above , are applicable only when the bsm physics contributes to the dispersive part @xmath39 of the @xmath40 mixing amplitude , and not to its absorptive part @xmath41 .",
    "this is true for most of the bsm models , in particular the minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) models @xcite where the cp violation emerges only from the ckm matrix . even in non - mfv models ,",
    "if the mixing box diagram contains only heavy degrees of freedom , bsm physics can not contribute to @xmath41 .",
    "such models include r - parity conserving supersymmetry , models with universal extra dimensions , little higgs models , two - higgs doublet models , etc . on the other hand , there are well - motivated models where the @xmath40 mixing box diagram contains two light degrees of freedom , resulting in an absorptive amplitude .",
    "we will discuss two such examples in this paper : ( i ) models with a scalar leptoquark , and ( ii ) r - parity violating ( rpv ) supersymmetry .",
    "these models can have _ flavour dependent _ couplings of light known particles with one heavy new particle ( squark or leptoquark ) , and hence can contribute to @xmath41 .",
    "this paves the way for an evasion of the grossman bound , and potentially high lifetime differences in both the @xmath32 and @xmath31 systems .",
    "we emphasize that these models are chosen just as examples and by no means exhaust the list of all such possible models .",
    "the new physics couplings also contribute to the mixing amplitudes ( hence the mass splittings @xmath42 between the stationary states and the cp asymmetries ) , and to decay rates . as a consequence",
    ", the bsm parameter space is severely constrained by these data . in spite of these constraints",
    ", we show that these bsm models can indeed enhance the lifetime difference in the @xmath32 up to its current experimental limit , obtained from the angular analysis of @xmath43 decays @xcite . in the @xmath31 system ,",
    "the value of @xmath44 can become as much as 2.5% and hence come within the capabilities of the @xmath12 factories @xcite . as a bonus ,",
    "the mixing - induced cp asymmetry @xmath29 can be enhanced by an order of magnitude from its small sm value . as an important byproduct",
    ", we also obtain limits on the couplings of the bsm models considered above , and predict enhanced branching ratios for decay channels correlated with the enhanced lifetime differences .",

    "since our final results claim enhancements of up to 5 times over the lifetime differences in the sm , and the bsm model calculations themselves depend on the unknown masses of the new particles , the higher order corrections would not change the conclusions qualitatively .",

    ", the measurement of @xmath178 should also be able to indicate whether @xmath44 is significant or not .",
    "the r - parity violating couplings that may enhance @xmath63 also tend to enhance the branching ratios @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "the relevant measurements are @xcite ( b^+ ^+ ) < 0.2410 ^ -6 , & & br(b^+ k^0^+ ) = ( 23.11.0 ) 10 ^ -6 , + br(b^0 ^0 ) < 0.2810 ^ -6 .",
    "[ br - bkpi ] taking all squarks to be degenerate at 300 gev , the values of @xmath149 and @xmath7 consistent with the above branching ratios and the @xmath108 measurement are shown in fig .",
    "[ rpv - bs ] .",
    "note that for the form factor in the @xmath183 mode , we use the value of the form factor that reproduces the central value of the @xmath184 measurement in ( [ br - bkpi ] ) with naive factorization , i.e. we assume that the current measurement shows no new physics effects .",
    "this makes our new physics estimates rather conservative .",
    "clearly , the value of @xmath149 in this scenario does not increase much beyond its sm value .",
    "however , the cp violating phase @xmath7 may be enhanced to as much as @xmath185 , making the cp violation observable through the decay modes @xmath43 , @xmath186 , or @xmath174 @xcite .    note that at large @xmath187 , values of @xmath188 are preferred , whereas @xmath189 is strongly disfavoured .",
    "this indicates that for @xmath188 ( @xmath190 ) , the sm and rpv amplitudes to @xmath108 interfere destructively ( constructively ) .",
    "this is because the effective four - fermi hamiltonian for the r - parity violation model comes with an opposite sign to that of the sm hamiltonian .",
    "this may be explained as follows .",
    "the @xmath191 interaction in the rpv susy gives @xmath192 under fierz reordering , and when the charge - conjugated spinors are replaced by ordinary spinors , a flip of their positions , which also changes the @xmath193 lorentz structure to @xmath194 , gives another negative sign .",
    "on top of that , the internal propagator is scalar and not a vector gauge particle , which introduces another negative sign in the amplitude .",
    "the bsm contribution thus has a net negative sign compared to the sm value , when the relative weak phase between the two amplitudes is zero .    the rpv susy scenario does not give rise to any significant new physics effects in the @xmath14 system , since the cp violating phase @xmath195 is also well measured , and in combination with the limit on br@xmath196 , constrains the new physics parameter space severely .",
    "we have studied models with ( i ) scalar leptoquark and ( ii ) r - parity violating supersymmetry as examples of bsm physics that may enhance the values of the lifetime differences @xmath149 as well as @xmath44 .",
    "such an enhancement is possible since the new couplings in these models are flavour dependent , and there are additional light degrees of freedom in the @xmath40 mixing box diagram .",
    "the latter contribute to @xmath41 , thus enabling the evasion of the so - called grossman bound , so that the lifetime differences can be higher .",
    "since the values of @xmath63 in the sm have uncertainties of @xmath62 , we look for enhancements of @xmath197 , so that such a large @xmath63 would be a clean signal of new physics .",
    "we summarise our results in table  [ tab - limits ] .",
    "let us point out the salient features that emerge from our analysis .",
    ".allowed values of the magnitude of the coupling product , @xmath198 , in the models considered in the text .",
    "the weak phase of @xmath160 is taken to vary in the entire range 0@xmath199 .",
    "we also give the allowed values of the lifetime differences and cp phase alongwith the decay modes whose rates have strong correlations with the enhancement of the lifetime difference . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ paramspace ] [ tab - limits ]    * among the models considered here , only the third generation leptoquark model predicts a large enhancement of @xmath11 over the sm range . in this model",
    ", the value of @xmath149 can be as high as 0.51 , which is restricted by the current experimental 95% c.l .",
    "bound from direct measurements .",
    "improvements in the @xmath149 measurements will hence either detect new physics of this kind , or will bound the coupling product @xmath200 in this model . *",
    "an enhancement of a factor of up to 5 is also possible for @xmath44 in the models with the third generation leptoquark .",
    "whereas the sm prediction for this quantity is @xmath201 , making its measurement extremely difficult and rather unappealing , @xmath202 is within the capability of the @xmath12 factories . limiting the value of @xmath44 from above",
    "also translates to bounding the coupling product @xmath203 in this model .",
    "* the enhancement in @xmath63 is correlated with an enhancement of @xmath204 .",
    "thus , looking for @xmath77 pairs in babar , belle , and lhcb is of major importance . with the current constraints on all the parameters in the third generation leptoquark model , the branching ratio of @xmath176 ( @xmath90 ) can be as high as 18% ( 0.4% ) .",
    "though an extremely difficult measurement , the gains from the analysis of this decay are significant .",
    "* the mixing - induced phase @xmath7 of the @xmath15 system can be large with the third generation leptoquark as well as with the rpv susy : @xmath205 can become as high as @xmath206 in the leptoquark model and up to @xmath9 in rpv susy .",
    "currently there is almost no constraint on @xmath7 , but improved measurements , if they do not detect new physics through cp - violating signals in @xmath207 , @xmath186 , or @xmath174 , can further squeeze the parameter space for bsm physics . * clearly , while non - mfv models are essential for enhancing @xmath63 , not all of them serve the purpose . among the models we have considered ,",
    "while the third generation leptoquark models give large @xmath63 enhancement , the second generation leptoquark models fail to do so because of severe constraints on their parameter space . the rpv susy model ,",
    "on the other hand , does not have as tightly constrained couplings , but the structure of the new physics contributions is such that though @xmath7 can be enhanced , the value of @xmath63 can not be increased .",
    "the three scenarios considered by us thus represent three different facets of non - mfv models .",
    "our analysis uses naive factorisation , and computes @xmath41 only to leading order . in rpv susy",
    ", we neglect the renormalisation group running of the wilson coefficients and the mixing of the rpv operator with the others .",
    "however , since we claim @xmath63 enhancements of up to a factor of 5 , and since there are anyway uncertainties in the model predictions due to the unknown masses of leptoquarks or squarks , improved calculations that take care of the above lacunae are not expected to change the conclusions qualitatively . we also take the strong phase difference between the sm and the bsm contributions to the hadronic decays to be vanishing .",
    "however , since the cp violation in hadronic decays does not play any role in our analysis , and we fit the hadronic decay form factors to the measured rates , this assumption has no impact on the predicted enhancement of @xmath63 .",
    "large values of @xmath154 are possible only in a special class of models that have flavour dependent couplings and light degrees of freedom in the @xmath40 mixing box diagram . in addition , the enhancement in @xmath63 comes coupled with an enhancement in some correlated decay rates and cp asymmetries . hence , a measurement of large @xmath154 would point one towards very specific sources of new physics .",
    "efforts towards the measurement of @xmath36 and @xmath35 , as well as the decay rates like @xmath13 are therefore highly encouraged ; they may open the door to a rich phenomenology .",
