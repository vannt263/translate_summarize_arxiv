    "half of the galaxies in our sample reside on the ` main sequence ' of star - forming galaxies at their redshift .",
    "three galaxies are found in the starburst region ( although in one of them the sfr might be over - estimated due to the contamination from an optically - bright agn ) .",
    "finally , two sources are found below the main sequence , suggesting that they are more quiescent systems .    _ the ` star formation law '  _ to first order , the co  detected galaxies in the udf cover the same parameter space as previous galaxy samples in the @xmath78@xmath79 diagram , although they preferentially reside towards the low - ir luminosity envelope of the relation , along the same sequence of local spiral galaxies and close to color - selected galaxies at @xmath10 .",
    "only two co  detected sources lie on the opposite side , closer to the locus of high-@xmath0 starbursts .",
    "two of the co non  detections are found to be inconsistent with the @xmath78@xmath79 relation , suggesting that co excitation in these sources must be low . using _ hst _ imaging to derive the scale radii of the galaxies in our sample , we discuss their location in the ` star formation law ' diagram : on average , the sources agree with a depletion time of @xmath61gyr , as found in previous studies , but outliers ( up to 1 dex ) exist .    _ gas fractions ",
    "_ with only two remarkable exceptions , the gas fractions observed in our study are slightly lower than what found in targeted observations of main sequence galaxies at similar redshift , but still significantly higher than what typically observed in the local universe .    _",
    "co- vs. dust - based estimates of gas mass  _ in a few cases , we have gas mass estimates derived from co as well as the dust continuum , via different recipes involving the dust  to  gas ratio .",
    "the dust  based estimates are a factor of @xmath625 smaller than those based on co. this is consistent with recent reports in the literature that dust  based estimates of ism masses of main sequence galaxies give significantly lower values than using the co emission .",
    "all these methods use a number of assumptions : _ co : _ extrapolation to a co(1 - 0 ) flux from a higher  j transition + choice of co  to ",
    "conversion factor , _ dust : _ assumption of temperature , dust sed template , optical depth , and dust  to  gas ratio . a larger sample of galaxies with well  defined dust seds is required to ultimately decide which gas  mass estimator is preferred .    in summary , accounting for detections as well as non  detections , we find large variations in the molecular gas properties of high  redshift galaxies .",
    "this might reflect the large variations in gas content of disk galaxies seen in semi - analytical models ( see , e.g. , @xcite and fig .  9 in @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps not unexpectedly , global scaling relations can not account for the large variations in gas content in individual high redshift galaxies .",
    "our approach through blind frequency scans of well  characterized cosmological deep fields adds additional constraints to the studies of the molecular gas content in distant galaxies , and are thus complementary to dedicated studies of single galaxies that are pre  selected by their optical properties ( e.g. sfr and stellar mass ) .",
    "our study demonstrates that such studies are now feasible , even with early  cycle alma observations .",
    "now that alma has reached completion , similar studies of larger fields will result in large , statistical samples , which are required to fully understand and beat down systematics and small number statistics .",
    "this will provide us with an entirely new approach to characterize the molecular gas content in distant galaxies .",
