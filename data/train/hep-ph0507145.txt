    "at the moment , string theory @xcite is the main candidate which allows to incorporate gravity into a quantum framework unifying the elementary particle interactions .",
    "string theory is based on the existence of additional spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "recently , a renewed interest for those extra dimensions has arisen due to several original proposals for universal extra dimension models @xcite ( in which all standard model fields may propagate in extra dimensions ) as well as brane universe models @xcite-@xcite ( in which standard model fields live in our 3-dimensional spatial subspace ) or intermediate models @xcite ( in which only gauge bosons and higgs fields propagate in extra dimensions while fermions are ` stuck ' at fixed points along these dimensions ) . in particular , among the brane universe models , the two different scenarios suggested by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) @xcite ( with large flat extra dimensions ) and by randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite ( with a single small warped extra dimension ) have received considerable attention .",
    "extra dimensional models constitute alternatives to the extensively studied supersymmetric theories @xcite , in the sense that these models have the following advantages .",
    "first , the add and rs brane models address a long standing puzzle : the gauge hierarchy problem ( huge discrepancy between the gravitational scale and electroweak scale ) .",
    "secondly , a unification of gauge couplings possibly occurs either at high scales ( @xmath3 gev ) uni - rs-@xcite within small warped extra dimension models or at lowered scales ( @xmath4 tev ) @xcite within large flat extra dimension models .",
    "finally , from a cosmological point of view , there is a viable kaluza - klein wimp candidate @xcite for the dark matter of the universe in both the universal extra dimension @xcite and warped geometry @xcite models .",
    "the additional interest for extra dimensional models concerns the mysterious origin of the strong mass hierarchy existing among the different generations and types of standard model ( sm ) fermions .",
    "these models have lead to completely novel types of approach in the interpretation of the sm fermion mass hierarchy , which is attractive , as it does not rely on the presence of any new symmetry in the short - distance theory , in contrast with the conventional froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite which introduces a ` flavor symmetry ' .",
    "indeed , the interpretation is purely geometrical , and is based on the possibility that sm fermions have different localizations along extra dimension(s ) which depend upon the flavor and type of fermions , a scenario realizable in both the add @xcite-@xcite ( see @xcite-@xcite for concrete realizations ) and rs @xcite ( see rsmany for a realization in rs extensions ) models . at this level ,",
    "one may mention the other higher - dimensional views suggested in literature @xcite-@xcite for generating an important sm fermion mass hierarchy . more specifically ,",
    "some higher - dimensional ideas have been proposed , within the add @xcite , rs @xcite or rs extension @xcite frameworks , in order to explain the lightness of neutrinos relatively to other sm fermions .    in this paper , we investigate the possibility that the sm fermion mass hierarchy is created through the type and family dependence of fermion locations within the warped geometry of the rs model ( the rs model does not need any new energy scale in the fundamental theory , in contrast with the add model ) .",
    "in such a scenario , the quark mass hierarchy as well as the ckm mixing angles can be nicely accommodated as shown in @xcite . here",
    ", we will construct the specific concrete realizations of this scenario in the leptonic sector .",
    "more precisely , we will determine the domains of parameter space with minimum fine - tunning ( describing fermion locations ) , which reproduce all the present experimental data on leptonic masses and mixing angles , and relying only on a minimal dependence of the yukawa coupling structure",
    ". the domains of parameter space obtained in this way will give rise to predictions on the neutrino sector .",
    "within the context of different sm fermion locations along a warped extra dimension , the case of majorana neutrino masses has already been studied : the results are that neutrino masses and mixing angles can be accommodated in both scenarios where neutrinos acquire masses through dimension five operators @xcite and via the see - saw mechanism @xcite . in our present article",
    ", we consider the case of dirac neutrino masses within the minimal scenario where a right handed neutrino is added to the sm fields . in a preliminary work @xcite on dirac neutrinos",
    ", the charged lepton yukawa coupling constants were assumed to be diagonal in flavor space ( for reasons of simplification ) .",
    "however , this is equivalent as to introduce unexplained strong hierarchies among the yukawa coupling constants .",
    "in contrast , in our present article , we assume the natural quasi universality of all lepton yukawa coupling constants so that the lepton mass hierarchy is solely governed by the above higher - dimensional mechanism .",
    "therefore , in our framework , the whole lepton mass hierarchical pattern , can be interpreted in terms of the higher - dimensional mechanism , thus solving the lepton mass hierarchical problem .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ frame ] , we describe the effective lepton mass matrices arising when the leptons possess different localizations along the warped extra dimension of the rs model . in section [ const ]",
    ", we make a short review of the experimental constraints applying on the considered rs scenario . in section",
    "[ real ] , we concentrate on the phenomenological implications of the model and present the domains of parameter space that reproduce the last experimental set of data concerning the whole leptonic sector .",
    "then , in section [ pred ] , some predictions on the neutrino masses and mixing angles are given and compared with the sensitivities of future neutrino experiments . finally , we conclude in section [ conclu ] .",
    "the rs scenario consists of a 5-dimensional theory in which the extra spatial dimension ( parameterized by @xmath5 ) is compactified on a @xmath6 orbifold of radius @xmath7 ( so that @xmath8 ) .",
    "gravity propagates in the bulk and the extra spatial dimension is bordered by two 3-branes with tensions @xmath9 ( vacuum energy densities ) tuned such that , @xmath10where @xmath11 is the bulk cosmological constant , @xmath12 the fundamental 5-dimensional gravity scale and @xmath13 a characteristic energy scale ( see below ) . within this background , there exists a solution to the 5-dimensional einstein s equations which respects 4-dimensional poincar invariance .",
    "it corresponds to a zero mode of the graviton localized on the positive tension brane ( namely the 3-brane at @xmath14 ) and to the following non - factorizable metric , @xmath15@xmath16 $ ] being the coordinates for the familiar 4 dimensions and @xmath17 the 4-dimensional flat metric .",
    "the bulk geometry associated to the metric ( [ rsmetric ] ) is a slice of anti - de - sitter ( @xmath18 ) space with curvature radius @xmath19 .",
    "let us now describe the physical energy scales within this rs set - up . while on the 3-brane at @xmath14 ( referred to as the planck - brane ) the gravity scale is equal to the ( reduced ) planck mass : @xmath20 ( @xmath21 newton constant ) , on the other 3-brane at @xmath22 ( called the tev - brane ) the gravity scale , @xmath23is affected by the exponential warpfactor @xmath24 . from eq.([rsratio ] ) , we see that for a small extra dimension such that @xmath25 ( @xmath13 is typically of order @xmath26 ) , one has @xmath27 so that @xmath28 .",
    "hence , the gravity scale @xmath29 on the tev - brane can be of the same order of magnitude as the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "moreover , if the sm higgs boson is confined on the tev - brane , it feels a cut - off at @xmath30 which guarantees the stability of higgs mass with respect to divergent quantum corrections .",
    "therefore , the rs model completely addresses the gauge hierarchy question . besides , by considering the fluctuations of the metric ( [ rsmetric ] ) , one obtains ( after integration over @xmath5 ) the expression for the effective 4-dimensional gravity scale as a function of the three fundamental rs parameters ( @xmath13 , @xmath7 and @xmath12 ) : @xmath31the feature that the effective 4-dimensional gravity scale is equal to the high planck mass @xmath32 insures that gravitational interactions appear to be weak from the 4-dimensional point of view , according to experience .      in order to generate the sm fermion mass hierarchy through the considered higher - dimensional mechanism , the fermions must reside in the bulk ( this is also required for the existence of a kaluza - klein wimp candidate in the rs model ) .",
    "then , the sm gauge bosons must live in the bulk as well , if the 5-dimensional gauge invariance is to be maintained ( gauge bosons have to be in the bulk also , to permit the gauge coupling unification in the rs model ) .",
    "another condition necessary to produce the sm fermion mass hierarchy , already mentioned in section [ intro ] , is that the sm ( zero mode ) fermions have different localizations along the warped extra dimension of the rs model . for that purpose ,",
    "each type of sm fermion field @xmath33 ( @xmath34 being the flavor index ) is coupled to its own 5-dimensional mass @xmath35 in the fundamental theory as , @xmath36where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is defined by eq.([rsmetric ] ) ) is the determinant of the rs metric . in order to modify the localization of zero mode fermions , the masses",
    "@xmath35 must have a non - trivial dependence on the fifth dimension , more precisely , a ` ( multi-)kink ' profile rubakov , rebbi . the masses @xmath35 could be the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of some scalar fields .",
    "an attractive possibility is to parameterize the masses as @xcite , @xmath39where the @xmath40 are dimensionless parameters .",
    "the masses ( [ vev ] ) are compatible with the @xmath41 symmetry ( @xmath42 ) of the @xmath43 orbifold .",
    "indeed , they are odd under the @xmath41 transformation , like the product @xmath44 ( as fermion parity is defined by : @xmath45 ) , so that the whole term ( [ mass ] ) is even .",
    "taking into account the term in ( [ mass ] ) , the equation of motion in curved space - time for a 5-dimensional fermion field , which decomposes as ( @xmath46 labeling the tower of kaluza - klein excitations ) , @xmath47admits the following solution for the zero mode wave function along extra dimension @xcite , @xmath48where the normalization factor reads as , @xmath49eq.([0mode ] ) shows that , if @xmath40 increases ( decreases ) , the zero mode of fermion is more localized near the boundary at @xmath14 ( @xmath22 ) , namely the planck(tev)-brane",
    ".    the sm fermions can acquire dirac masses via their yukawa coupling to the higgs vev .",
    "this coupling reads as ( starting from the 5-dimensional action ) , @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the 5-dimensional yukawa coupling constants , the dots stand for kaluza - klein ( kk ) excited mode mass terms and the effective 4-dimensional mass matrix is given by the integral : @xmath52 as discussed in section [ rsgeom ] , the higgs profile must have a shape peaking at the tev - brane : we assume the following exponential form , @xmath53 which can be motivated by the equation of motion for a bulk scalar field @xcite . using the @xmath54 boson mass",
    ", one can express the amplitude @xmath55 in terms of @xmath56 and the 5-dimensional weak gauge coupling constant @xmath57 .    from eq.([massmatrix ] ) , we observe that even for universal yukawa coupling constants ( here we assume the natural quasi universality : @xmath58 with @xmath59 , following the philosophy adopted in @xcite ) , the sm fermion mass hierarchy can effectively be created .",
    "indeed , the fermion masses @xmath60 can differ greatly ( spanning several orders of magnitude ) for each flavor @xmath61 as the overlap between higgs profile @xmath62 and zero mode fermion wave function @xmath63 varies with the flavor .",
    "the reason is that the zero mode fermion wave functions are flavor dependent through their dependence on @xmath64 parameters ( see eq.([0mode ] ) ) .",
    "the analytical expression for the fermion mass matrix ( [ massmatrix ] ) , obtained by integrating over @xmath5 , has been derived in eq.([analytic ] ) of appendix [ appenda ] .",
    "this expression involves only the quantities @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath40 because the @xmath67 dependences introduced by the amplitude @xmath68 and yukawa coupling @xmath69 exactly compensate each other .",
    "therefore , the dependences of charged lepton and neutrino dirac mass matrices of type ( [ massmatrix ] ) read respectively as , @xmath70 where @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) are associated to the charged lepton ( neutrino ) yukawa couplings , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) parameterize ( _ c.f . _",
    "eq.([vev ] ) ) the 5-dimensional masses ( _ c.f . _ eq.([mass ] ) ) for right handed charged leptons ( additional right handed neutrinos ) and @xmath75 parameterize the 5-dimensional masses for fields belonging to lepton @xmath76 doublets ( namely both left handed neutrinos and left handed charged leptons ) .",
    "next , we discuss the different kinds of constraints on the parameters of the rs model ( @xmath13 , @xmath7 and @xmath12 ) as well as on the 5-dimensional mass parameters ( @xmath77 ) within our framework where gauge bosons and sm fermions reside in the bulk . @xmath78 * @xmath13 and @xmath12 : * the bulk curvature must be small compared to the higher - dimensional gravity scale ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "thus , the rs solution for the metric ( _ c.f . _ eq.([rsmetric ] ) ) can be trusted @xcite . in order to consider the most natural case , where there is only one energy scale value in the rs model , we first assume the limiting situation ( as in @xcite ) : @xmath80this equality between @xmath12 and @xmath32 comes from eq.([rskrelat ] ) together with our choice of the @xmath13 value and the fact that one must have @xmath81 , as explained in section [ rsgeom ] . @xmath78 * @xmath7 : * furthermore , precision electroweak ( ew ) data place constraints on the rs model @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the reason is , that deviations from precision ew observables arise in the framework of rs model with sm fields ( except the higgs ) inside the bulk .",
    "we briefly review these ew constraints .",
    "first , the mixing between the top quark and its kk excited states results in a new contribution to the @xmath82 parameter which exceeds the bound set by precision ew measurements @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is a way to circumvent this problem by choosing a certain localization configuration for quark fields ( or in other words , certain values of the 5-dimensional mass parameters @xmath40 for quarks ) .",
    "secondly , mixings between the ew gauge bosons and their kk modes ( which go typically like @xmath83 ) also induce deviations from some precision ew observables , leading to experimental constraints on the rs model .",
    "e.g. considerations regarding modifications of the weak gauge boson masses lead to the experimental bound : @xmath84 ewboundb where @xmath85 is the mass of first kk excitation of @xmath86 gauge boson ( the difference between @xmath87 and @xmath88 is insignificant in the rs model ) .",
    "the deviations from w boson coupling to fermions on the planck - brane ( tev - brane ) constrain the rs model via : @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) @xcite .",
    "this experimental bound depends on the localization of sm fermion fields in the bulk ( and thus on the values of mass parameters @xmath40 for sm fermions ) which fixes the effective amplitude of weak gauge boson coupling to fermions .",
    "if the weak gauge boson masses and couplings are treated simultaneously , one obtains the conservative bound @xmath91 for a universal value of sm fermion mass parameters @xmath40 lying in the range @xmath92 $ ] ( and for @xmath93 ) @xcite .",
    "finally , a global analysis based on a large set of precision ew observables was performed in @xcite and has yielded a lower bound on @xmath94 varying typically between @xmath95 and @xmath96 for a universal value of sm fermion mass parameters which verifies : @xmath97 .",
    "experimental bounds on flavor changing ( fc ) processes may also constrain the rs model since significant fc effects can be generated in the rs scenario with bulk sm fields @xcite , as will be discussed in the following .",
    "first , the additional exchange of heavy lepton kk excitations prevents the cancellation ( originating from the unitarity of leptonic mixing matrix ) which suppresses the sm contributions to fc processes like lepton decays : @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . for @xmath101 , one can have some values of mass parameters @xmath77 reproducing the correct lepton data ( under the hypothesis of dirac neutrino masses and the assumption of flavor diagonal charged lepton yukawa couplings ) such that the branching ratios for these three rare decays ( calculated in the rs framework ) are well below their experimental upper limit @xcite .",
    "secondly , the non - universality of neutral current interactions induces flavor violating couplings , due to the flavor dependence of fermion localization , when transforming the fields into the mass basis , and thus , tree - level fc effects are generated through the ( kk ) gauge boson exchanges . for @xmath101 and certain values of mass parameters @xmath102",
    "fitting the known leptonic masses and mixings ( if neutrinos acquire majorana masses via dimension five operators ) , all the rates of leptonic processes @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 [ @xmath107 ( induced by the fc effects mentioned just above ) are compatible with the corresponding experimental bounds @xcite .",
    "similarly , for @xmath108 and some values of the quark parameters @xmath40 in agreement with quark masses and mixings , mass splittings in neutral pseudo - scalar meson systems can satisfy the associated experimental constraints @xcite .    in order to take into account the above constraints on the rs model from precision ew data and results from experimental bounds on fc reactions ( which both depend on the @xmath40 parameter values )",
    ", we fix the first kk gauge boson mass at the typical value @xmath101 , because , in the following , various values of the @xmath40 parameters ( fitting lepton data ) are considered .",
    "this kk mass choice is equivalent in the rs model @xcite.[mkk ] ] ( for the @xmath13 value of eq.([ka ] ) ) to the value of rs parameter product @xmath66 : @xmath109we stress that the above constraints from precision ew measurements , derived for universal values of sm fermion parameters @xmath40 , do not strictly apply to our analysis , since we will consider flavor and type dependent values of parameters @xmath77 ( so that the whole lepton flavor structure can be accommodated ) .",
    "similarly , the above results from fc effect considerations do not strictly apply to our scenario , because these are obtained for values of parameters @xmath77 different from the ones we will take here ( and which must fit the dirac neutrino masses without relying on a strict yukawa coupling dependence ) .",
    "we can check that the @xmath56 value of eq.([ra ] ) is well consistent with a resolution of the gauge hierarchy problem ( see section [ rsgeom ] ) : indeed this value leads to a 5-dimensional gravity scale on the tev - brane of @xmath110 ( _ c.f .",
    "_ eq.([rsratio ] ) ) .    besides , for this choice @xmath101 , the mixings between the zero modes of the quarks or leptons and their kk excitations , induced by the yukawa couplings ( [ yuk ] ) , are not significant , as shown in the studies @xcite .",
    "indeed , the kk fermion excitations are then decoupled since their masses are larger than ( or equal to ) @xmath94 ( for any @xmath40 value ) in the rs model @xcite .",
    "the first consequence of this small mixing is that the quark / lepton masses and mixing angles can be reliably computed from the mass matrix @xmath111 for the zero modes ( see action ( [ yuk ] ) ) as the mass corrections due to kk modes can be safely neglected @xcite ( as well as at the one loop - level @xcite ) .",
    "another consequence is that the variation of effective number of neutrinos contributing to the @xmath112 boson width , induced by mixings between the zero and the kk modes of neutrinos , is well below its experimental sensitivity , as shown in @xcite , for characteristic values of the parameters @xmath113 ( of order unity ) reproducing the correct dirac neutrino masses and mixing angles . @xmath78",
    "* @xmath77 : * from a theoretical point of view , the natural values of 5-dimensional masses @xmath35 ( _ c.f .",
    "_ eq.(vev ) ) appearing in the original action ( [ mass ] ) are of the same order of magnitude as the fundamental scale of the rs model , namely the bulk gravity scale @xmath12 , avoiding the introduction of new energy scales in the theory .",
    "hence , for @xmath114 ( like in eq.([ka ] ) ) , the absolute values of lepton parameters @xmath77 ( defined by eq.([vev ] ) ) should be of the order of unity : @xmath115    next , we present all the existing bounds concerning the 5-dimensional mass parameters @xmath40 .",
    "the motivation is to get an idea of what is the typical range allowed for @xmath40 values .",
    "nevertheless , the reader must keep in mind that these bounds have been obtained under the simplification assumption that each of the parameters @xmath40 are equal to a universal value @xmath116 .",
    "this does not strictly apply to our scenario , where the parameters @xmath117 are flavor and type dependent . for a universal value @xmath118 , considerations on contributions of virtual kk tower exchanges to fermion pair production ( similarly to contact - like interactions ) at colliders ( lep ii and tevatron run ii ) force the @xmath29 value to be significantly in excess of @xmath119 ewboundd , disfavoring then the rs model as a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "bounds can also be placed on @xmath116 by calculating the contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon due to kk excitation exchanges : the experimental world average measurement for @xmath120 translates into the bound @xmath121 ( for the first kk masses between a few and @xmath122 ) @xcite . finally , an examination of the perturbativity condition on effective yukawa coupling constants yields the constraint @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "we end this section with a discussion on the effective couplings of non - renormalizable four - fermion operators involving lepton fields , as these depend on the location parameters @xmath77 .",
    "first , the rare lepton flavor violating reactions induced by such operators , as for instance the decay @xmath124 , are not expected to reach an observable rate , unless leptons are localized close to the tev - brane @xcite , a configuration which will never occur for the @xmath77 values that we consider here .",
    "such operators , for example @xmath125 or @xmath126 , are also dangerous as they permit proton decay channels @xcite .",
    "it seems impossible to find quark and lepton locations which are in agreement simultaneously with the known fermion masses and the proton life time @xcite , pointing to an additional symmetry for example such as baryon or lepton number ( protecting the proton against its instability ) .",
    "a precise analysis of the quark locations is beyond the scope of our study .      in this section",
    ", we present a different characteristic scenario : we give a possible set of rs parameters ( giving rise to a smaller @xmath94 than the one mentioned previously ) and 5-dimensional mass parameters different from the ones proposed in the previous section , in agreement with the several types of constraints , in the case where precision ew constraints are softened by specific mechanisms ( with bulk fermions and gauge bosons ) . @xmath78",
    "* @xmath7 : * as in the previous section , we maintain the parameter product @xmath66 at , @xmath127 so that the tev - brane gravity scale @xmath128 , while still addressing the gauge hierarchy solution . @xmath78 * @xmath13 and @xmath12 : * precision ew data place a typical bound on the first kk gauge boson mass @xmath84 ( see section [ large ] ) , which renders the discovery of the gauge boson kk excitations at lhc ( via direct production ) quite challenging .",
    "indeed , the lhc ( with an optimistic integrated luminosity of @xmath129 ) will be able to probe @xmath130 values only up to about @xmath131 for a universal absolute value of the @xmath40 parameters smaller than unity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some models have been suggested in order to make the precision ew lower bounds on @xmath94 less stringent .",
    "this we will discuss now . in @xcite",
    ", it was proposed to enhance the ew gauge symmetry to @xmath132 , recovering the usual gauge group via a breaking of @xmath133 on the planck - brane .",
    "the right handed sm fermions are promoted to @xmath133 doublet fields , with the new ( non physical ) component having no zero mode . hence , for example in the lepton sector ( with an additional right handed neutrino ) , the right handed @xmath134 parameters would now describe the location of @xmath133 doublets but the total number of @xmath77 parameters would remain identical . because of the bulk custodial isospin gauge symmetry arising in this context , all the precision ew data ( including those on the `` oblique '' parameters @xmath135 , @xmath136 and the shift in coupling of @xmath137 to @xmath112 ) can be fit with a mass @xmath94 of only a few tev .",
    "we underline the fact that this result concerning @xmath94 has been obtained for a universal value of @xmath117 parameters larger than @xmath138 ( in contrast with the non universal @xmath77 values which will be considered in our analysis ) .",
    "similarly , the brane - localized kinetic terms for fermions @xcite _ or _ gauge bosons @xcite , which are expected to be present in any realistic theory ( induced radiatively and also possibly present at tree - level ) , allow to improve the fit of precision ew observables and to relax the resulting lower bound on @xmath94 value down to a few tev ( see @xcite for gauge boson kinetic terms and @xcite for the fermion case ) .",
    "assume that @xmath139 , and , that one of the above models hold , so that the precision ew data do not conflict with such a light gauge boson kk excitation .",
    "this @xmath94 value is simultaneously inside the lhc potential search reach ( see above ) and compatible with the present collider bound obtained at tevatron run ii ( with a luminosity of @xmath140 and a center - of - mass energy of @xmath141 ) on the first kk graviton mass , namely , @xmath142 at @xmath143 ( for @xmath144 ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , this bound is equivalent to @xmath145 since the ratio @xmath146 is equal to @xmath147 ( _ c.f .",

    "we note that for the choice @xmath139 , as in the scenario of previous section where @xmath101 , mixings between the zero and the kk modes of leptons should still not be significant , because the kk lepton masses ( systematically larger than @xmath94 ) remain typically large relatively to the zero mode lepton masses .",
    "@xmath78 * @xmath77 : * since the masses ( [ vev ] ) have to be of the same order as the fundamental scale @xmath12 , eq.([kb1 ] ) and eq.([kb2 ] ) tell us that the natural absolute values of lepton parameters @xmath77 read as , @xmath151    the whole discussions of section [ large ] , on all the existing bounds concerning 5-dimensional mass parameters @xmath40 and on the non - renormalizable operators , still hold within the characteristic framework considered in this section .",
    "in this section , we search for the parameter region values which reproduces all the experimental data on lepton masses and mixing angles .      the analysis of the parameter space requires the study of certain limits . from the formula for lepton mass matrices @xmath152 ( see appendix [ appenda ] ) , it is clear that , in large regions of the parameter space spanned by @xmath75 , @xmath153 , we have to a good approximation : @xmath154where the @xmath155 are suitable functions for a certain region .",

    "* @xmath66 : * according to eq.([ra ] ) and eq.([rb ] ) , corresponding to the two considered scenarios of sections [ large ] and [ small ] , we take the characteristic value @xmath162 for the parameter product @xmath66 .",
    "nevertheless , our results ( for @xmath161 and @xmath77 values ) and predictions ( on neutrinos ) are not significantly modified for @xmath66 not exactly equal but only close to @xmath163 .",
    "different orders of magnitude for @xmath66 are not desirable because the condition @xmath164 is needed for solving the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "@xmath78 * @xmath77 : * we describe the range for the @xmath117 values and our motivations for choosing this range .",
    "with respect to the typical @xmath77 values , the two scenarios proposed respectively in sections [ large ] and [ small ] are equivalent in the sense that their characteristic relation ( [ ca ] ) and ( [ cb ] ) both lead to @xmath77 with absolute values of order of unity , if one does not consider high @xmath165 values as excluded by the various existing bounds mentioned at the end of section [ large ] ( although those have been deduced under the simplification hypothesis of a unique and universal @xmath77 value ) .",
    "motivated by the orders given in eq.([ca ] ) and eq.([cb ] ) as well as the existing bounds concerning @xmath117 parameters ( obtained under the simplification assumption of a universal @xmath77 value ) , we restrict ourself to the range : @xmath166a choice which is appropriate to the two scenarios of large and small @xmath167 described in previous section .",

    "we have found configurations of lepton locations , along the extra dimension , reproducing all the present experimental data on leptonic masses and mixing angles , in the case where neutrinos acquire dirac masses ( with a right handed neutrino added to the sm fields ) .",
    "the neutrino and charged lepton sectors have been treated simultaneously since these two sectors are related phenomenologically ( via the lepton mixing matrix @xmath227 ) and theoretically ( because the left handed neutrinos and charged leptons are localized in an identical way , since they belong to the same @xmath76 doublet ) .",

    "then , we have deduced , from the domains , predictions on the two measurable leptonic quantities ( with the exception of the physical complex phases ) which are still unknown ( more precisely , weakly constrained ) , namely the lepton mixing angle @xmath226 and the ground of neutrino mass spectrum ( only the two neutrino mass squared differences are fixed by the present experimental results ) .",
    "we predict an approximate order of magnitude for @xmath283 lying between @xmath292 and @xmath293 .",
    "a part of this range should fall into the sensitivity interval reachable by next generation of neutrino experiments , which means that the studied mechanism , based on the localization of bulk fermions within the rs model , should be partially testable ( from the parameter space point of view ) by future experiments .",
    "we also predict a neutrino mass spectrum with the normal hierarchy and the smallest mass eigenvalue in the interval : @xmath294 .",
    "hence , the studied model within the rs framework is not especially predictive on neutrino masses , compared e.g. to an equivalent model ( also producing sm fermion mass hierarchies from flavor and nature dependent locations of fields ) in the add framework which predicts : @xmath295 ( for majorana neutrino masses ) @xcite .",
