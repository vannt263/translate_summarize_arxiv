    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) supersoft x - ray source rx  j0513.9@xmath06951 ( hereafter rx  j0513 ) shows a prominent recurrency of optical high and low states with quasi - regular intervals ( @xmath3 days high and @xmath4 days low states ) .",
    "copious supersoft x - rays were detected only in the optical low states ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the transition mechanism between high and low states have not been fully elucidated yet , although a few ideas were proposed ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent progress ) .",
    "we have found a new clue to this transition mechanism from modeling of the recurrent nova ci aquilae .",

    "it reached the optical maximum ( @xmath5 mag ) on 2000 may 5 .",
    "the visual brightness quickly decreased to @xmath6 in about 50 days .",
    "then , it stays at @xmath7 for about 150 days , i.e. , a plateau phase .",
    "@xcite reported a sharp @xmath8 mag drop of @xmath9-magnitude on 2000 november 23 , about 200 days after the optical maximum , and kiyota ( 2001 , vsnet archives , http://vsnet.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/vsnet/ ) also observed a @xmath8 mag drop of @xmath10-magnitude around the same day as matsumoto et al.s ( 2001 ) observation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "shortly after this drop , both the @xmath9- and @xmath10-magnitudes recovered by @xmath1 mag but stayed at @xmath1 mag below the level before the drop . @xcite and @xcite attributed this drop to cessation of massive winds by calculating time - evolution of optically thick winds on a @xmath11 white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "the above feature of ci aql light curve reminds us the optical high - to - low transition of rx  j0513 . in this paper",
    ", we try to reproduce the sharp drop in the optical light curves , both for ci aql and rx  j0513 , by the same mechanism . in ",
    "2 , our numerical method and models for the ci aql 2000 outburst are briefly introduced and summarized .",
    "the numerical results for the ci aql 2000 outburst are given in  3 .",
    "we try to reproduce the transition between high and low states of rx  j0513 in  4 .",
    "discussion follows in  5 .",
    "the mid plateau phase is a common feature among the u sco subclass of the recurrent nova class , to which both u sco and ci aql belong .",
    "the plateau phase is well explained by the contribution of an irradiated disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the presence of the disk in outburst was observationally confirmed by @xcite .",
    "our binary model is illustrated in figure [ ci_aql_3figure ] , which consists of a main - sequence star ( ms ) filling its roche lobe , a wd photosphere , and a disk around the wd .",
    "a circular orbit is assumed .",
    "we also assume that the surfaces of the wd , the companion , and the disk emit photons as a blackbody at a local temperature which varies with position .",
    "we assume an axi - symmetric accretion disk with the size and thickness of @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the outer edge of the optically thick part of the accretion disk , @xmath15 is the effective radius of the inner critical roche lobe for the wd component , @xmath16 is the height of the surface from the equatorial plane , and @xmath17 is the distance from the symmetry axis . here ,",
    "we adopt @xmath18 during the strong wind phase , but @xmath19 when rapid mass accretion resumes after the optically thick wind stops , to mimic the flaring - up disk by spray ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the other two parameters of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are determined by light curve fittings .",
    "we have used the same parameters as those in @xcite unless otherwise specified .",
    "the mass of the white dwarf was determined to be @xmath22 by @xcite .",
    "the mass and temperature of the companion star were estimated to be @xmath23 and 7,300 k ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for the present evolutional status ) from the light curve fitting of the orbital modulations in the 2000 outburst @xcite .",
    "the inclination angle is a free parameter , which is redetermined from our light curve fitting .",
    "time evolution of the photospheric radius and temperature of the wd are calculated from kato & hachisu s ( 1994 ) optically thick wind solutions ( see * ? ? ? * for more details of the numerical methods ) .",
    "when the photospheric radius shrinks smaller than the binary size , the irradiation effects both of the disk and of the companion become important ( see , e.g. , fig . 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* for such an example ) .",
    "orbital modulations during the plateau phase have been reported by @xcite .",
    "their @xmath9 light curve data show a scatter of @xmath24 mag so that we average them into 36 phase bins as shown in figure [ rc_mag_m15_wind_orbital ] .",
    "no secondary eclipses were observed in contrast to the later phase orbital light curves @xcite . to fit these orbital modulations as well as the entire evolution of @xmath9-magnitude , we have calculated light curves with various parameters ( @xmath20 is changed by 0.1 steps , @xmath21 by 0.05 steps , and the inclination angle @xmath25 by 1@xmath26 steps ) .",
    "the best fit model is shown in figure [ rc_mag_m15_wind_orbital ] , i.e. , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    here",
    "we plot two identical orbital modulations , but one is shifted by 0.36 mag down .",
    "the brighter one corresponds to the earlier stage on 2000 july 17 while the fainter one does to that on 2000 october 1 . to reproduce the light curves with no secondary",
    "eclipses , we need both ( 1 ) large ( area ) irradiation effect to reproduce the brightness , and ( 2 ) bright sources other than the companion to eliminate the secondary eclipse",
    ". then , we assumed that ( a ) the outer edge of an optically thick disk extends up to almost the orbital separation as illustrated in figure [ ci_aql_3figure]a , and that ( b ) the wd photosphere is as large as @xmath29 on july 17 and @xmath30 on october 1 if the other conditions are the same between these two epochs .",
    "any light sources other than the disk or the companion are unlikely to contribute to the @xmath9-magnitude because the strong wind blows up off nebulosities around .",
    "this large extension of the disk naturally explains evident lack of secondary minima .",
    "the width of sharp eclipse minima , @xmath31 orbital phase , is caused by the partial occultation of the wd photosphere .",
    "these large photospheric radii ( @xmath32 from july 17 to october 1 ) are very consistent with our theoretical model because wds blow a wind when @xmath33 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the effect of a larger inclination angle is canceled out by the effect of a larger radius of the disk .",
    "for example , a combination of the inclination angle @xmath34 and the disk of @xmath35 can also reproduce the light curve modulations ( dashed line ) as shown in figure [ rc_mag_m15_wind_orbital ] .",
    "its eclipse dip seems to be too deep to be compatible with the observation .",
    "however , the total amplitude of the modulations is @xmath36 mag ( see fig . 4 of * ?",
    "* for the original observation ) and still consistent .",
    "here we adopted a set of @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in both @xmath28 and @xmath34 cases , the secondary occults only a part of the disk .",
    "this is , however , enough to make a orbital modulation observed because the central part of the disk is much brighter than the outer part .",
    "the velocities of winds calculated are as fast as @xmath37 km  s@xmath38 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the wind mass loss rate is as large as @xmath39  yr@xmath38 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observationally much faster wind velocities are reported , for example ,",
    "@xmath40 km  s@xmath38 in ci aql ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such a strong wind affects the surface of the accretion disk .",
    "because of a large velocity difference between the wind and the disk surface , it certainly drives the kelvin - helmholtz instability at the interface . only the very surface layer of the disk is dragged away outward with the velocity at least several hundred km  s@xmath38 like a free stream moving outward .",
    "this surface free stream is optically thick near the original disk but becomes optically thin somewhere outside because of geometrical dilution effect .",
    "we regard the transition place from optically thick to thin as the edge of the extended disk .",
    "it should be noted that a high density part of the disk is hardly changed by this relatively tenuous surface free stream and still resides within its roche lobe because the internal density of the disk is much denser than that of the wd wind .",
    "the wind mass loss rate is about @xmath41  yr@xmath38 and its velocity is @xmath42 km  s@xmath38 , so that the density of the wind is estimated from the continuity ( @xmath43 ) to be about @xmath44 g  @xmath45 at the distance of @xmath46 from the center of the wd .",
    "on the other hand , the density of the standard accretion disk is about @xmath47 g  @xmath45 at the same radius . here , we assume the standard accretion disk model @xcite with a mass accretion rate of @xmath48  yr@xmath38 .",
    "after the wind stops , the photospheric radius of the wd quickly shrinks in the kelvin - helmholtz timescale of the envelope , i.e. , @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the kelvin - helmholtz timescale and the thermal energy of the wd envelope , respectively , and @xmath52 is the luminosity of the wd .",
    "here , we adopt a typical thermal energy of the wd envelope from our solutions .",
    "it takes 20 days from @xmath53 to @xmath54 and takes another 20 days from @xmath54 to @xmath55 from our wind solutions and evolution models .",
    "the disk edge of optically thick part shrinks to a normal size of @xmath56 times the roche lobe radius as observed in the supersoft x - ray sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may occur in several dynamical timescales , i.e. , a few to several days . here",
    ", we adopt 10 days , i.e. , the transition from configuration ( a ) to ( b ) in figure [ ci_aql_3figure ] .",
    "we adopt @xmath57 for configuration ( b ) .",
    "then , the mass transfer rate from the ms to the wd increases to make a spray around the accretion disk as seen in luminous supersoft x - ray sources .",
    "this can be mimicked by a flaring edge of the accretion disk , i.e. , configuration ( c ) in figure [ ci_aql_3figure ] ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for light curves and flaring - up disk models after the wind stops ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath58 .",
    "it also takes several dynamical timescales .",
    "here we take @xmath59 days for the formation time of the spray .",
    "thus , we are able to reproduce a sharp @xmath8 mag drop around 2000 november 23 and the ensuing @xmath1 mag recovery soon after the drop , as shown in figure [ rc_irradmix_ciaql00_m15 ] . a similar transition was observed in the u sco 1999 outburst on hjd 2,451,244 just before the detection of supersoft x - rays ( see fig . 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lmc supersoft x - ray source rx  j0513.9@xmath06951 shows regular transitions between @xmath60 days optical high ( x - ray off ) and @xmath61 days optical low ( x - ray on ) state .",
    "the x - ray off / optical high state was understood by a large expansion of the wd photosphere , which is triggered by an increase in the mass transfer rate onto the wd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when the wd envelope expands , an optically thick wind begins to blow . as we already know in ci aql , the sharp drop of @xmath62-mag",
    "is naturally explained by cessation of the wind .",
    "our scenario is as follows :    * 1 .",
    "* we assume the metallicity of @xmath63 and hydrogen content of @xmath64 for the envelope of the wd in rx  j0513 since the lmc metallicity is reported to be about a third of the solar metallicity . +",
    "we have directly calculated the duration of the wind phase and the kelvin - helmholtz timescale on massive wds of 1.0 , 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 1.35 , 1.36 , 1.37 , and @xmath65 ( see also * ? ? ? * for wind solutions ) .",
    "the @xmath66 wd model gives us a reasonable wind timescale of @xmath67 days and a kelvin - helmholtz timescale of @xmath68 days .",
    "we use the ephemeris revised by @xcite .",
    "the inclination angle is not known but suggested to be low .",
    "here we adopt @xmath69 .",
    "the light curve is not so different among @xmath70 .",
    "the calculated light curve is plotted in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513 ] , which is made by connecting brightness at the orbital phase 0.4 ( phase 0.0 is the minimum of the light curve modulation ) .",
    "the mass ratio of @xmath71 is assumed because a high mass transfer rate of @xmath72  yr@xmath38 is suggested ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the non - irradiated surface temperature of the lobe - filling ms companion is assumed to be 13,000 k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* we assume the original mass transfer rate of @xmath73  yr@xmath38 as a reasonable value of thermally unstable mass transfer for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "this value is realized whenever the wind does not suppress the mass transfer .",
    "so , we start a rapid mass accretion to the wd at the rate of @xmath73  yr@xmath38 ( denoted by @xmath76-mark in fig . [ vmagfit_rxj0513 ] ) .",
    "the wd envelope gradually expands and eventually blows a wind ( see the mid and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ vmagfit_rxj0513 ] ) .",
    "this causes a quick rise of @xmath62-mag .",
    "here we assume the disk expansion of @xmath77 in the wind phase .",
    "it takes a few to several dynamical timescales .",
    "we adopt 3 days .",
    "the massive winds having the rate of @xmath78  yr@xmath38 certainly absorb supersoft x - rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this rapid mass accretion is suppressed by the strong wind , because the wind hits and then strips - off the very surface layer of the ms companion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a description of the stripping effect by winds ) .",
    "we stop the rapid mass accretion when the wind mass loss rate increases and the mass - stripping rate overcomes the mass transfer rate of @xmath73  yr@xmath38 .",
    "this happens when the wd photosphere expands to the value shown in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513 ] ( @xmath79-mark ) .",
    "however , we still keep a low rate ( @xmath48  yr@xmath38 ) during the period of draining of the disk ( a few times viscous timescale of the disk @xmath80 days , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) even after the rapid mass accretion stops . + * 6 . * when the optically thick winds stops ( @xmath81-mark ) ,",
    "we expect copious supersoft x - rays as observed in the u sco 1999 outburst @xcite .",
    "then the photosphere of the wd shrinks from @xmath82 ( @xmath83  k ) to @xmath84 ( 430,000  k ) in @xmath85 days .",
    "the photospheric temperature is consistent with the blackbody fitted temperatures ( @xmath61 ev ) of the supersoft x - rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as shown in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513 ] .",
    "the disk shrinks to a normal size of @xmath57 in a week and then the edge of the disk begins to flare up , i.e. , @xmath86 in another week , as described in  3 . + * 7 .",
    "* rapid mass accretion to the wd resumes ( @xmath76-mark ) @xmath87 days after the wind stops .",
    "we expect that the mass transfer rate gradually increases just after the wind stops but it takes @xmath88 days to reach the wd surface .",
    "this timescale may be regarded as a viscous timescale of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "then , the photospheric radius of the white dwarf expands in @xmath85 days and eventually blows winds .",
    "then , go to * 4 * and repeat the cycle .    here",
    "we assume the apparent distance modulus of @xmath89(intrinsic)@xmath90(absorption)@xmath91 to rx  j0513 .",
    "the calculated color of @xmath92 is roughly consistent with the observational color of @xmath93 @xcite , @xmath94 @xcite , or @xmath95",
    "@xcite for the color excess of @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "thus , we are able to reproduce the transition between the optical high and low states of rx  j0513 as shown in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513 ] .",
    "our new model is essentially different from the previous expansion / contraction models of the white dwarf photosphere in the following sense : the emergence / decay timescale of the observed supersoft x - rays is as short as one or two days @xcite .",
    "this short timescale can not be explained by the expansion / contraction of the envelope .",
    "we have calculated the timescales of photospheric contraction based on our wd envelope model @xcite and show them in figure [ thermal_time_one ] against the wd mass .",
    "the contraction timescale depends on the envelope mass of the wd and it is shortest just after the optically thick wind stops as shown in figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513 ] . in this phase ,",
    "the timescale of contraction by a factor of four is about three times the kelvin - helmholtz timescale .",
    "it is clear that the timescale of contraction by a factor of four can not be shorter than six days even if the wd mass is very close to the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "we may conclude that only the expansion / contraction model of the white dwarf photosphere can not reproduce a very short timescale of x - ray on / off .",
    "we need another mechanism .    on the contrary ,",
    "optically thick winds completely obscure supersoft x - rays within one day after it starts . the wind mass loss rate increases from zero to @xmath97  yr@xmath38 in a day when it starts , or it decreases from @xmath98  yr@xmath38 to zero in a day when it ceases , as easily seen from figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513 ]",
    ". this wind mass loss rate of @xmath99  yr@xmath38 is large enough to absorb supersoft x - rays ( see , e.g. , discussion of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the scenario proposed by @xcite , all the progenitor systems of type ia supernovae once experience the optically thick wind phase during their way to type ia supernova .",
    "rx  j0513 may be an example for such a wind phase .",
    "we have calculated the efficiency of mass accretion to be about 35% for the case of figure [ vmagfit_rxj0513 ] .",
    "the other 65% is blown in the wind or stripped off from the companion surface and eventually lost from the binary system . assuming this efficiency being kept",
    ", we can expect that the white dwarf in rx  j0513.9@xmath06951 will explode as a type ia supernova after about @xmath100 is transferred even when the wd mass is @xmath11 .",
    "we thank k. matsumoto for providing us machine readable data sets of the ci aql 2000 outburst .",
