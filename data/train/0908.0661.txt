    "the einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory , which explains the theory of a gravitating non - abelian gauge field , may be regarded as the most natural generalization of einstein - maxwell gravity .",
    "the solitonic solution of this theory in 4 dimensions has been discovered by bartnik and mckinnon for the gauge group @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the colored black hole solutions of this theory with @xmath3 gauge group have been introduced in @xcite , while those with @xmath2 gauge group have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "these solutions have led to certain revisions of some of the basic concepts of black hole physics based on the uniqueness and no - hair theorem .",
    "it is now well - known that this theory possesses  hairy  black hole solutions , whose metric is not a member of the kerr - newmann family ( see @xcite for a detailed review in 4 dimensions and @xcite for a recent review in higher dimensions ) .",
    "furthermore , unlike the kerr - newmann black holes , the geometry exterior to the event horizon is not determined uniquely by global charges measurable at infinity , although only a small number of parameters are required in order to describe the metric and matter field @xcite .",
    "solutions of the eym equations in higher dimensions have been also studied in @xcite .",
    "these solutions were also extended in the presence of cosmological constant @xcite and gauss - bonnet term @xcite .    from stability analysis , it turns out that the solution with zero or positive cosmological constant is unstable @xcite , while those with negative cosmological constant are stable @xcite .",
    "the presence of a negative cosmological constant also invites the topological black holes into the game .",
    "indeed , the horizon topology of an asymptotically flat black hole should be a round sphere , while in ads space it is possible to have a black holes with zero or negative constant curvature horizon too .",
    "these black holes are referred to as topological black holes in the literature , and investigated by many authors @xcite .",
    "all of these investigations are mainly based on einstein - maxwell theory , however numerical solutions have been considered in @xcite in the presence of @xmath4 yang - mills field .",
    "it may be of interest to generalize these topological solutions for a non - abelian matter field and investigate their properties .",
    "indeed , the analysis of einstein s equation with nonlinear field sources may shed new light on the generic properties of topological solutions of einstein s equations . in this paper , we want to study the ( @xmath0)-dimensional topological black hole solutions of eym gravity with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we give a brief review of the field equations of eym gravity for a semisimple gauge group in sec .",
    "[ fiel ] . in sec .",
    "[ 4d ] we first present the 4-dimensional solution for gauge group @xmath5 and investigate its properties , and second we introduce the 5-dimensional solution which incorporates a logarithmic term unprecedented in other dimensions . by a similar analogy",
    "we extend these solutions in @xmath6 dimensions with gauge group @xmath1 .",
    "we finish our paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "the model which will be discussed here is an ( @xmath0)-dimensional eym system for an @xmath7-parameters gauge group @xmath8 , which is assumed to be at least semisimple with structure constants @xmath9 .",
    "the metric tensor of the gauge group is @xmath10 where the latin indices @xmath11 , @xmath12 .... go from @xmath13 to @xmath7 , and the repeated indices is understood to be summed over . according to cartan s criteria the determinant of @xmath14 is not zero , and therefore one may define @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the positive value of determinant of @xmath14 .",
    "the action of @xmath17-dimensional eym gravity with negative cosmological constant @xmath18 may be written as @xmath19 ,   \\label{act1}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the ricci scalar and @xmath21 is the gauge field tensor defined as : @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ gfield ] ) @xmath23 is a coupling constant and @xmath24 s are the gauge potentials .",
    "variation of the action ( [ act1 ] ) with respect to the spacetime metric @xmath25 and the gauge potential @xmath26 yield the eym equations as @xmath27 where the gauge current and the stress - energy tensor carried by the gauge fields are @xmath28 respectively .",
    "the 4-dimensional static metric of a topological spacetime with a hyperbolic horizon may be written as @xmath29 introducing the coordinates @xmath30 and using the wu - yang ansatz @xcite , one obtains the explicit form of ym potentials as @xmath31 which have the lie algebra of @xmath32 with nonzero structure constants and @xmath33 as follows : @xmath34 now , it is a matter of calculation to show that the ym fields ( [ ym4 ] ) satisfy the ym field equation ( [ fe2 ] ) , while the gauge currents ( [ cur ] ) do nt vanish and are @xmath35 here , it is worth to mention that one may perform a position - dependent gauge transformation from the gauge field ( [ ym4 ] ) to a set of three abelian gauge fields which satisfy the maxwell equation with zero current independently @xcite .",
    "of course the scalar @xmath36 is invariant under this transformation . in @xmath37 dimensions , @xmath38 for both the solutions of ym and maxwell equations , and",
    "therefore the solution of eym is the same as the topological solution of reissner - nordstrom solution .    to find the function @xmath39",
    ", one may use any components of eq .",
    "( [ fe1 ] ) .",
    "the simplest equation is the @xmath40 component of these equations which can be written as @xmath41 ^{\\prime } = \\frac{3}{l^{2}}r^{2}-\\frac{e^{2}}{r^{2 } } , \\label{eqf4}\\ ] ] where prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath42 .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqf4 ] ) is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an integration constant which is related to the mass of the spacetime .",
    "of course the above solution satisfies all the other components of the field equations .",
    "this solution has the same properties as the asymptotically ads topological solution of em gravity in 4 dimensions , and we do not discuss it more here . also it is worth to mention that this solution is the counterpart of the spherical solution of eym theory introduced in @xcite .",
    "the 5-dimensional solution incorporates a logarithmic term unprecedented in other dimensions , and therefore we shall treat it in some details .",
    "recently , static non - abelian black hole solutions of five - dimensional maximal ( @xmath45 ) gauged supergravity has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , we consider the 5-dimensional , static metric with hyperbolic horizon which may be written as @xmath46 introducing the coordinates @xmath47 and using the ansatz @xmath48 one obtains : @xmath49 the non - zero structure constants of the group are : @xmath50 which show that the gauge group is isomorphic to @xmath51 .",
    "again , it ia a matter of calculations to show that the gauge currents are @xmath52 calculating the left hand - side of ym equation ( [ fe2 ] ) , one obtains exactly the same expressions as ( [ j5 ] ) .",
    "thus the gauge fields ( [ ym5 ] ) satisfy the ym field equation ( [ fe2 ] ) . using the definition of the metric tensor of the gauge group ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath53 the value of the invariant @xmath54 for the ym fields ( [ ym5 ] ) is @xmath55 while for spherically symmetric solutions of maxwell theory is @xmath56 comparison of the invariant @xmath54 for ym and maxwell fields given in eqs . ( [ f2ym ] ) and ( [ f2max ] )",
    "shows that one can not introduce a position - dependent transformation from the non - abelian gauge fields to a set of abelian ones which satisfy the maxwell equation .",
    "this guarantees that the yasskin theorem which states that the solutions of eym and em theories are the same @xcite does not hold in 5 dimensions . also , it is worth to mention that the @xmath42-dependence of the components of energy momentum tensor for eym and em theories are not the same",
    "this point has been discussed in details in the next section .",
    "the @xmath40 component of the field equation ( [ fe1 ] ) reduces to @xmath57 ^{\\prime } = \\frac{4}{l^{2}}r^{3}-\\frac{2e^{2}}{r},\\ ] ] with the solution @xmath58 where @xmath44 is an integration constant which is related to the mass of the spacetime .",
    "of course , the metric function ( [ f5 ] ) satisfies all the other components of the eym field equations .    in order to study the general structure of the solution given in eq .",
    "( [ f5 ] ) , we first look for curvature singularities . it is easy to show that the kretschmann scalar @xmath59 diverges at @xmath60 and so the above metric given by eqs .",
    "( [ met2 ] ) and ( [ f5 ] ) has an essential singularity at @xmath60 .",
    "since the function @xmath39 goes to @xmath61 as @xmath42 goes to zero and becomes @xmath62 as @xmath42 goes to infinity , the singularity is timelike .",
    "seeking possible black hole solutions , we turn to look for the existence of horizons .",
    "the horizon(s ) is ( are ) located at the roots of @xmath63 .",
    "the function @xmath39 may have zero , one or two real roots . denoting the largest real root of @xmath39 by @xmath64 ,",
    "we consider first the case that @xmath39 has one real root . in this case",
    "@xmath65 vanishes at @xmath66 the value of mass for which the metric function has one real root may be obtained as @xmath67 + \\frac{l^{2}+l\\sqrt{l^{2}+8e^{2}% } } { 24}\\right\\}.   \\label{mex5}\\ ] ] then , the metric of eqs .",
    "( [ met2 ] ) and ( [ f5 ] ) presents a naked singularity provided @xmath68 , an extreme black hole for @xmath69 and a black hole with two horizons if @xmath70 .",
    "figure [ fr5 ] shows the diagram of @xmath39 for various values of the mass parameter .",
    "one may note that although the metric function ( [ fr5 ] ) has a logarithmic term which is absent in the 5-dimensional reissner - nordstrom solution , the properties of these two solutions are the same .",
    "the hawking temperature of the black holes can be easily obtained by requiring the absence of conical singularity at the horizon in the euclidean sector of the black hole solutions .",
    "one obtains @xmath71 which vanishes for the extreme black hole with @xmath72 given in eq .",
    "( [ mex5 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the metric has the following form : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the line element of @xmath75-sphere . in order to obtain the gauge fields",
    ", we use the coordinates @xmath76 and the ansatz @xmath77 where @xmath12 runs from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "it is a matter of calculation to show that the lie algebra of the gauge group is @xmath1 with the following @xmath33 : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is @xmath82 one can also shows that the above gauge fields ( [ ymn ] ) satisfy the ym field equation ( [ fe2 ] ) , while the gauge currents do not vanish .",
    "again , one may calculate the value of the invariant @xmath54 for the @xmath83 non - abelian gauge fields ( [ ymn ] ) and @xmath79 abelian gauge fields of maxwell equation with spherical symmetry as @xmath84 thus , one can not introduce a transformation from the non - abelian gauge fields to a set of abelian ones which satisfy the maxwell equation .",
    "this shows that the solutions of eym theory are not the same as em theory in @xmath85 dimensions with @xmath86 .",
    "also , one may show that the @xmath42-dependence of the components of energy momentum tensor for eym and em theories are not the same . using the definition of the energy - momentum tensor ( [ emt ] ) ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath87 while the energy - momentum of maxwell field may be written as : @xmath88 as one may note by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ emtym ] ) and ( [ emtm ] ) , the @xmath42-dependence of energy - momentum of these two fields are different for @xmath86 .",
    "also the tangential components of these two energy momentum tensor differ by a minus sign for @xmath89 and is zero for @xmath90 .",
    "these differences show that the yasskin theorem which states that the solution of eym and em theories are the same @xcite is only true in 4 dimensions .",
    "also , as we see below these differences drastically change the properties of the solutions .",
    "the @xmath40-component of the field equation ( [ fe1 ] ) reduces to @xmath91 ^{\\prime } = \\frac{n}{l^{2}}% r^{n-1}-(n-2)e^{2}r^{n-5}=0 .",
    "\\label{eqfn}\\ ] ] integrating eq .",
    "( [ eqfn ] ) , one obtains @xmath92    unlike the topological reissner - nordstrom solutions in 6 and higher dimensions , the singularity at @xmath60 for the solutions with non - negative mass is spacelike , and therefore it is unavoidable .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath39 approaches to @xmath93 as @xmath42 goes to zero and goes to @xmath94 at large @xmath42 .",
    "these solutions present black holes with one horizon .",
    "the spacetime of eqs .",
    "( [ metn ] ) and ( [ fn ] ) with negative mass presents a naked singularity if @xmath95 , an extreme black hole for @xmath96 and a black hole with inner and outer horizons provided @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is @xmath99 figure [ fr6 ] shows @xmath39 in term of @xmath42 for various values of @xmath44 .",
    "the metric of the extreme black hole near horizon may be written as @xmath100 where @xmath101 thus , the structure of the spacetime near horizon is almost the same as that of einstein - maxwell gravity .",
    "the only difference is that the horizon radius of these extreme black holes can be obtained analytically [ see eq . ( [ rexn ] ) ] , and are smaller than those of einstein - maxwell theory .",
    "also the value of @xmath102 is different .",
    "the hawking temperature is given by @xmath103 which vanishes for @xmath72 .",
    "the entropy is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the volume of the constant @xmath106 and @xmath42 hypersurface with radius 1 .",
    "now we want to compute the mass of the system .",
    "one may note that the adm mass diverges as in the case of solutions introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . using the first law of thermodynamics , one",
    "may obtain the thermodynamical mass ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) through the use of the relation @xmath107 as @xmath108 the above equation shows that the parameter @xmath44 may be denoted as the mass parameter as mentioned before .",
    "it is worth to mention that these results are valid in all dimensions .",
    "in this paper , we introduced the topological black holes of einstein - yang - mills theory with hyperbolic horizon and investigate their properties .",
    "the topological solution of eym gravity in 4 dimensions is not a new solution , and is exactly the same as the topological solution of em theory .",
    "this is due to the fact that one can perform a position - dependent gauge transformation , from the @xmath109 gauge fields of ym theory and a set of three abelian gauge fields of maxwell theory .",
    "but , we showed that one can not perform a position - dependent gauge transformation from the @xmath110 gauge fields of ym theory and a set of abelian gauge fields of maxwell equation in 5 and higher dimensions .",
    "also , we noted that the components of energy - momentum tensor of ym fields are proportional to @xmath111 which are drastically different from the components of energy - momentum of a maxwell field which are proportional to @xmath112 .",
    "indeed , not only the @xmath42-dependence of the components of energy - momentum of the @xmath1 ym fields ( @xmath86 ) is different from the energy - momentum components of a @xmath113 gauge field , but also they are different in a minus sign which has a drastic effect on the properties of the solutions [ see the minus sign in front of the last term in the metric function ( [ fn ] ) ] .",
    "that is , the eym solutions in 5 and higher dimensions are new topological solutions .",
    "these solutions in higher dimensions with negative mass have the same properties as the solutions in em gravity . here , it is worth to compare the distinguishing features of non - negative mass solutions of eym and em gravities in 6 and higher dimensions .",
    "first , these solutions of eym theory do not present a naked singularity , while those of em gravity do .",
    "that is , the solutions of eym theory respect the cosmic censorship hypothesis .",
    "second , the singularity in the case of eym black hole is spacelike and therefore unavoidable , while the singularity of em black holes are timelike .",
    "third , the solutions in eym gravity can not present an extreme black hole , while those of em gravity have extreme black hole solutions .",
    "furthermore , unlike the reissner nordstrom black holes , the geometry exterior to the event horizon is not determined by a global charge measurable at infinity .",
    "also , it is worth to mention that one does not have a static asymptotically de sitter solution in 6 and higher - dimensional eym gravity with non - negative mass , while in em theory this kind of solution exists .",
    "this is due to the fact that the metric function of higher - dimensional einstein - yang - mills gravity in the presence of a positive cosmological constant , @xmath114 , may be written as @xmath115 which is negative everywhere for @xmath116 , and therefore the solution is not static .",
