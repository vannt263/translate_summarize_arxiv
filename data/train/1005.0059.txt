    "recent measurements of coherent pion production by muon neutrinos at neutrino energies around 1 gev have inspired significant discussion  @xcite . in coherent pion production , the neutrino interacts with an entire nucleus ; no nucleon recoil occurs and the @xmath4 tends to be emitted in the forward direction .    for charged current ( cc ) coherent pion production , both k2k and sciboone set",
    "limits on the ratio of cc coherent pion production to the total cc cross sections near 1  gev@xcite , these published upper limits are significantly lower than those predicted by the rein and sehgal model  @xcite which is widely used for many neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "meanwhile , evidence for neutral current ( nc ) coherent pion production with neutrino energy less than 2 gev has been reported by the miniboone collaboration @xcite .",
    "the sciboone collaboration also reported nonzero nc coherent pion production @xcite although the result is only 1.6 standard deviations above zero coherent production .",
    "currently there is no theoretical model which can accommodate all of these recent measurements .",
    "further experimental inputs may help the development of theoretical models .",
    "nc coherent pion production at neutrino energies around 1 gev is also important for neutrino oscillation experiments as a substantial contribution to nc @xmath4  production ( nc@xmath4 ) .",
    "the largest contribution to nc@xmath4  is nc resonant pion production , in which the neutrino interacts with a single nucleon in the target nucleus and excites it to a baryon resonance ; the resonant decay produces a pion and a nucleon .",
    "nc @xmath4  production is the largest @xmath5-induced background in neutrino experiments searching for @xmath6 oscillations .",
    "nc@xmath4  events can not be distinguished from @xmath7 signal events when , for example , one of the two photons associated with @xmath8 is not detected .",
    "both miniboone s and sciboone s previous measurements of nc coherent pion production were performed using only emitted @xmath4  kinematics . however , in addition to the @xmath4  kinematics , the absence of a recoil nucleon is a clear and less model - dependent feature of coherent pion production . in sciboone ,",
    "detection of the recoil nucleon is possible using the fully active and fine - grained vertex detector , scibar .    in this paper",
    ", we report a measurement of nc coherent @xmath4production using a new analysis method in which the lack of recoil nucleons is used to extract the fraction of coherent pions within the inclusive @xmath4  dataset .",
    "sciboone s full neutrino data set , corresponding to @xmath9 protons on target , is used . to simulate coherent @xmath10 production , the rein and sehgal model  @xcite , including lepton mass corrections  @xcite ,",
    "the axial vector mass @xmath11 and the nuclear radius parameter @xmath12 used in the model are set to 1.0 @xmath13 and 1.0 fm , respectively .",
    "these are the same values used in previous sciboone papers  @xcite .",
    "this paper updates our previous result@xcite , so , not only the coherent @xmath10 production model but all simulations and the experimental setup used in this analysis are the same as previously described .",
    "the sciboone detector is comprised of three subsystems : a scintillating bar neutrino vertex detector called scibar , an electromagnetic calorimeter , and a muon range detector .",
    "we use scibar as the neutrino target as well as the particle tracker for this analysis .",
    "scibar consists of 14336 polystyrene ( @xmath14 ) scintillator bars .",
    "the scintillators are arranged vertically and horizontally to construct a @xmath15 volume with a total mass of 15 tons .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scibar_schematic ] , nc @xmath4  production is observed as two isolated tracks in scibar due to two gamma rays , coming from the decay of the @xmath4 , converted into two @xmath16 pairs .",
    "event candidate in sciboone data .",
    "the neutrino beam runs from left to right in this figure , encountering scibar , the electromagnetic calorimeter ( ec ) and the muon range detector ( mrd ) , in that order .",
    "the circles on scibar indicate adc hits for which the area of the circle is proportional to the energy deposition in that channel .",
    "this event display shows the electromagnetic shower tracks from the pair conversions of the two @xmath4   decay photons . ]",
    "the background events stem from sources both internal and external to scibar .",
    "internal backgrounds are neutrino interactions other than nc@xmath4  ( mainly cc ) within scibar .",
    "external backgrounds come from neutrino interactions in the material outside of the detector volume ( dirt background events ) as well as cosmic rays . to reduce these background events ,",
    "several event selections are performed before extracting coherent @xmath4s .    to reject cc background events ,",
    "identifying muons is paramount .",
    "we identify the following three types of tracks as muons and reject such events , ( i ) tracks escaping from the side of scibar , ( ii ) tracks stopping in scibar with delayed timing hits due to the decay electrons and ( iii ) tracks penetrating the electromagnetic calorimeter located at the downstream of scibar . for the dirt background rejection ,",
    "we use the upstream part of scibar as a charged particle veto and require that the reconstructed vertices of both gamma ray candidates be in scibar .",
    "finally , we require that the reconstructed invariant mass of two gamma ray candidates be close to the @xmath4  mass .",
    "all selections are identical to those used in the previous analysis  @xcite and are described in detail there .    after event selection ,",
    "657 events remain . subtracting the estimated background of 240 events ( 202 internal and 38 external ) yields 417 signal events .",
    "the mc expectation is 368 events .",
    "the numbers and distributions obtained by the mc simulation are normalized with the cc data sample @xcite .",
    "the purity of nc @xmath4production after all event selections is estimated to be 61% .",
    "the efficiency for nc@xmath4  production is estimated to be 5.3% .",
    "the efficiency for nc coherent @xmath4production , incoherent @xmath4production  production is defined as all nc@xmath4  events except for coherent @xmath4  production . after event selections ,",
    "89% of the incoherent events come from resonant pion production and the rest come from deep inelastic scattering . ] with recoil neutron and with recoil proton are estimated to be 7.6% , 6.2% and 4.5% .",
    "in nc coherent pion production , there is no recoil nucleon in the final state since the @xmath4  is produced by the neutrino interacting with the whole nucleus .",
    "conversely , a recoiling nucleon should be present in a resonant pion event . to separate the nc coherent @xmath4events from the nc resonant @xmath4  events , recoil protons in the final state",
    "the recoil protons are detected by their large energy deposition near the neutrino interaction vertex , so - called vertex activity .",
    "we search for the maximum deposited energy in a scintillator strip around the reconstructed vertex , an area of @xmath17 in each view .",
    "the choice of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 from the reconstructed vertex ) for the area is based on the vertex resolution which is approximately 12  cm for each direction ( @xmath20,@xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "a @xmath4  at typical sciboone energies travels , on average , @xmath2320  nm before decaying , so the reconstructed intersection of the gamma tracks is a good estimate of the neutrino interaction vertex .",
    "figure  [ fig : vtxact ] shows the maximum deposited energy distribution after all selections .",
    "most of the coherent @xmath4  contribution is peaked at zero while the other @xmath4  events have high energy activity due to recoil protons .",
    "events with energy deposition greater than 2 mev are considered to have activity at the vertex .",
    "note that incoherent pion production with a neutron recoil leaves no vertex activity unless the neutron kicks off protons in the region where we search for the energy deposit . based on our mc simulation ,",
    "the fraction of proton recoils in all incoherent @xmath4  events is reduced from 71% in the sample with vertex activity to 35% in the sample without vertex activity .    ,",
    "incoherent nc@xmath4  with recoil neutrons , incoherent nc@xmath4  with recoil protons , internal backgrounds with a @xmath4 in the final state , internal background without a @xmath4 in the final state and `` dirt '' background events are shown separately for the mc simulation.,width=264 ]",
    "when a neutrino interacts with the entire nucleus , the following relation should be satisfied : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the four - momentum transfer to the target nucleus from the neutrino and the radius of target nucleus , respectively .",
    "this means that the cross section decreases rapidly when @xmath27 become smaller than @xmath26 . using eq .",
    "[ eq : cohshiki ] , we can deduce @xmath28 following ref .",
    "@xcite . in this equation ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are the @xmath4  energy and direction with respect to the neutrino beam , respectively . from this fact",
    ", we can determine the fraction of coherent @xmath4  production using the reconstructed @xmath4  kinematic variable @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the reconstructed @xmath4  energy calculated as the sum of the reconstructed energies of two gamma ray candidates and @xmath33 is the reconstructed @xmath4  direction with respect to the neutrino beam axis .",
    "we simultaneously fit two @xmath34 distributions , with and without the vertex activity , with three templates made by dividing the final mc sample into nc coherent @xmath4 , nc resonant @xmath4  and background samples . two parameters , @xmath35 and @xmath36 scale the nc coherent @xmath4  and nc incoherent @xmath4  templates independently .",
    "the background sample is fixed to the value of the mc prediction although the systematic errors on the background prediction are taken into account .",
    "the expected number of events in the @xmath37-th bin in the @xmath38 distribution is expressed as : @xmath39 the fit minimizes the expression : @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the observed ( expected ) number of events in all bins @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the poisson likelihood to find @xmath44 events when @xmath45 events are expected . when the systematic errors for each bin and their correlation expressed with covariance matrix @xmath46 ( @xmath47 )",
    "are given , the likelihood is expressed as @xmath48\\nonumber \\\\      & & \\times \\exp\\bigl[-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\sum_{k=1}^{n}(x_{j}-n^{\\rm exp}_{j})v^{-1}_{jk}(x_{k}-n^{\\rm exp}_{k})\\bigr]\\biggr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is a normalization constant .",
    "the details of the systematic errors and the calculation of the integral are described in ref .",
    "the result of the fit is : @xmath50 the @xmath38 distribution after the fitting is shown in figure  [ fig : pi0cohangleafterfit ] .",
    "the @xmath51 per degree of freedom ( dof ) , before the fit is 30.8/39 = 0.79 , and it is 26.6/37 = 0.72 after the fit .",

    "are included in the errors of @xmath52 and @xmath36 . without the systematic errors , we obtain @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "hence , the uncertainty of the measurement is dominated by the statistical uncertainty",

    "the mean neutrino energy for nc coherent @xmath4  events in the sample is estimated to be 0.8 gev .",
    "the fractional error of this cross section ratio is 21% while the previous result s fractional error is 60% ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "hence , the result has been improved by a factor of three with the new analysis using vertex activity .",
    "this result is 5.8 standard deviations above the no coherent production assumption .",
    "the measured cross section is also consistent with the mc prediction based on the rein and sehgal model  @xcite .",
    "the result is evidence of non - zero coherent pion production via neutral current interactions at mean neutrino energy 0.8 gev .",
    "the sciboone collaboration measured the ratio of the cc coherent pion to total cc production as @xmath59 at 1.1 gev @xcite . according to eq .",
    "[ eqn : sciboone_nccoh ] and [ eqn : sciboone_cccoh ] , the ratio of cc coherent pion production to nc coherent production is measured to be @xmath60 in contrast , the rein and sehgal model @xcite as well as many other models predict @xmath61 without the lepton mass correction @xcite .",
    "even if we take it into account that the neutrino energy of the cc measurement ( 1.1 gev ) is higher than that of nc measurement ( 0.8 gev ) , the corrected ratio ends up with a smaller value because the cross section increases with neutrino energy .",
    "so far , there is no model which can accommodate our measurement of the cc / nc coherent pion production ratio at these energies , although the measurement of the ratio at higher energies ( @xcite , @xmath237 gev ) is consistent with 2 .",
    "the miniboone collaboration measured the ratio of nc coherent pion to nc single @xmath4  production to be : @xmath62 below 2.0 gev @xcite , where @xmath63 is the cross section for coherent @xmath4production and @xmath64 is the cross section for exclusive nc resonant single @xmath4  production .",
    "the qualifier `` exclusive '' in the latter cross section definition by the miniboone collaboration refers to a neutrino interaction produced in the resonant channel and with a single @xmath4  in the final state . using our fit result ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) shown in eq .",
    "[ eqn : fitresult ] , for sciboone , the ratio of nc coherent pion to nc single @xmath4  production is found to be : @xmath65 where we assume that @xmath36 scales the nc single resonant @xmath4  production ( although @xmath36 actually scales all incoherent @xmath4  production including the multi meson production ) .",
    "in fact , single resonant @xmath4  production is dominates the incoherent @xmath4  sample , comprising 81% after event selections . according to eq .",
    "[ eqn : miniboone_nccoh ] and [ eqn : sciboone_nccoh2 ] , the sciboone measurement agrees with the miniboone result within uncertainties .",
    "it should be noted that miniboone uses a @xmath66 target and includes diffractive hydrogen scattering in their simulation while sciboone uses a @xmath67 target and does not include diffractive hydrogen scattering in the simulation .",
    "however , the effect of these differences is less than 10% , which is much smaller than the uncertainty of the sciboone measurement ( 23% ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have observed nc coherent @xmath4  production at mean neutrino energy 0.8 gev .",
    "the ratio of the nc coherent @xmath4production to the total cc cross sections is measured to be @xmath68 based on the rein and sehgal model .",
    "our measurement confirms the previous miniboone result .",
    "the ratio of cc coherent @xmath69 to nc coherent @xmath4  production is calculated to be @xmath3 using sciboone s previous cc coherent pion measurement while many models predict 2 as this ratio .",
