    "recently , cassan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) conducted a fairly comprehensive census of planets in the milky way using the microlensing technique . for planets at orbital radii of 0.5 - 10",
    "au they reported that @xmath8 of stars host planets with masses in the range @xmath9 , @xmath10 host cool neptunes with masses @xmath11 , and @xmath12 host super - earths with masses @xmath13 .",
    "the results are encouraging for a discipline so young , but the uncertainties are large for the lower mass planets , and also the measurements do not extend down to planets of earth - mass . in this paper",
    "we attempt to address these problems by proposing a modified strategy for detecting low - mass planets by microlensing .",
    "our strategy is based on a proposal originally made in 1998 by griest & safizadeh for detecting planets in microlensing events of high magnification .",
    "high magnification occurs when the source star passes almost directly behind the lens star , so that @xmath14 , or @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the einstein radius , crossing time and time of closest approach between the lens and source stars , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 the einstein radius , the impact parameter between the lens and source stars in angular coordinates , and the angular radius of the source star respectively .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the projected impact parameter in the lens plane between the lens and source stars in units of @xmath22 .",
    "thus @xmath23 . finally , for planetary events , we denote by @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 the planet : star mass ratio , projected separation in units of @xmath22 and axis relative to the source star track respectively .",
    "the fundamental parameter of microlensing , the einstein radius @xmath22 , is defined in rattenbury et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . ] .",
    "these very well aligned events are rarer than normal microlensing events that have magnifications of only a few , but they are easily recognizable because the peak magnification is approximately @xmath27 and this is @xmath28 . moreover , as griest and safizadeh showed , if a planet orbits the lens star , it almost certainly produces a perturbation to the light curve close to the peak of the light curve .",
    "it thus appeared possible to search for planets with high efficiency merely by monitoring the peaks of events that had high magnification .",
    "this was noted by several groups ( gaudi et al .",
    "1998 ; rhie et al .",
    "2000 ; bond et al . 2002 ; rattenbury et al .",
    "2002 ) and subsequently demonstrated to be correct . since 2002 a steadily growing number of high magnification events was discovered and alerted each year by the moa and ogle collaborations .",
    "several of these events were monitored by ` follow - up ' networksmicrofun + planet : planet.iap.fr + robonet - ii : robonet.lcogt.net + mindstep : www.mindstep-science.org ] and this led to the discoveries of several planets ( udalski et al .",
    "2005 ; gould et al . 2006 ; gaudi et al .",
    "2008 ; bennett et al . 2008 ; dong et al . 2009 ; janczek et al .",

    "2012 ; han et al .",
    "2013 ) , some of the first measurements of planetary abundances ( gould et al .",
    "2006 , 2010 ) , and also to a measurement of limb darkening ( fouque et al , 2010 ) .    a new class of events was also discovered by the moa and ogle microlensing collaborations in their quests for high magnifications events .",
    "both collaborations found events having very high magnifications , of order 1,000 ( e.g. , abe at al .",
    "2004 ; dong et al . 2006 ) . when these were first discovered it was natural to assume they would provide greater sensitivity to planets .",
    "this assumption is the subject of the present paper .",
    "our conclusion is that low - mass planets can be efficiently searched for in events with moderately high magnifications of order 50 - 200 , and that the greater frequency of these events in comparison to those with higher magnifications lends advantage to monitoring them .",
    "however , to take full advantage of their discovery potential , telescopes with apertures in the range 1 - 2 m would be needed to photometer them with sufficient precision to detect low - mass planets .",
    "using such telescopes the planetary mass function of cassan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) may be able to be extended down to earth mass . because such planets have special importance in the search for the proverbial ` earth twin ' , and because their abundance will constrain theories of planetary formation",
    ", it is important to optimise strategies to encompass these planets in observing programmes .",
    "recently han ( 2009 ) and han and kim ( 2009 ) examined the sensitivity of the high magnification technique for detecting planets .",
    "however , they did not explicitly examine the sensitivity as a function of magnification , nor did they focus on the lower magnification events considered in this paper .",
    "our results are therefore complementary to theirs .",
    "liebes ( 1964 ) first suggested that planets might be detected by gravitational microlensing .",
    "his analysis was based upon the use of einstein arcs .",
    "1 shows the well - known geometry of the pair of moving einstein arcs that are formed in a normal microlensing event ( paczynski 1996 ) . for clarity",
    ", the radius of the source star ( projected to the lens plane ) has been greatly exaggerated .",
    "typically it is of order @xmath29 and the einstein arcs are of comparable width .     and the source star radius is scaled to its projected value in the lens plane .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath22 is approximately 2 au in typical galactic microlensing events .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to suppose the presence of a planet close to the ring as shown in the figure .",
    "this figure ( without the planet ) is adapted from paczynski ( 1996).,width=377 ]    fig .",
    "1 may be used to understand qualitatively the main features of planet detection in high magnification events .",
    "straightforward geometrical considerations show that the lengths of the einstein arcs in the lens plane near the time of maximum magnification are approximately @xmath30 .",
    "if the lens star hosts a planet , and if the planet is situated fairly close to either the upper or the lower portions of the einstein ring as shown in the figure , then one of the einstein arcs will slide by it during the event , and be perturbed by it . in this way a planet betrays its presence .",
    "the effect is large because the image of the source star is magnified by the lens star , and the magnified image is perturbed by the planet .",
    "if the planet is closer to the einstein ring than the arc length , as shown in the figure , the duration of the planetary perturbation is given by the time required for the arc to slide by the planet .",
    "this is easily shown to be approximately @xmath31 where @xmath32 in @xmath33 .",
    "their speeds are therefore @xmath34 .",
    "this equals @xmath35 ( rattenbury et al .",
    "2002 ) . dividing the speed into the above expression for an arc length we obtain @xmath31 for the slide - by time . ] .",
    "the result is independent of @xmath21 , and therefore of the peak magnification @xmath36 , as @xmath37 .",
    "higher magnifications produce longer arcs , but they rotate faster , and the slide - by time is unchanged .",
    "the magnitudes of the perturbations are surprisingly large , as discussed below .",
    "they are positive if the source star trajectory threads the lens star : planet system ( @xmath38 ) and vice versa .",
    "as expected , they increase ( approximately proportionally ) with the mass of the planet , and as the planet approaches the einstein ring .",
    "we note that these scaling laws differ qualitatively from those found for perturbations caused by planetary caustic crossings ( horne et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "several examples of computed planetary perturbations may be found in the literature that confirm the above expectations ( rhie et al . 2000 ; rattenbury et al . 2002 ; bennett et al .",
    "2008 ) . for typical values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 days planetary pertubations of duration",
    "about 1.4 hr are predicted . for typical ranges of @xmath41 and @xmath16 ( see  6 below ) we expect durations ranging over @xmath4 hr . such perturbations may be conveniently observed from a single observing site .",
    "there are two exceptions to the above .",
    "if a planet lies very close to the einstein ring , the difference from the planetless light curve can become large . in this case",
    "the above perturbative picture fails , and a quantitative analysis ( as carried out below ) is required .",
    "second , for events with very small impact parameters in which the source star passes behind the lens star , the geometry of the moving arcs is different from that depicted in fig .",
    "1 . in these events a pair of arcs is formed fore and aft of the lens , instead of above and below it ( liebes 1964 ) . a planet perturbs both arcs , one after the other , leading to the formation of two very brief spikes of opposing polarities on the light curve .",
    "examples of such spikes have been observed and modelled ( dong et al .",
    "2009 ; janczek et al . 2010 ; han & kim 2009 ) .",
    "further examples are displayed below .",
    "wambsganss ( 1997 ) originally used magnfication maps to demonstrate the detectability of planets by gravitational microlensing . in this method rays",
    "are shot from the observer , which is treated as a point source , through the lens in the thin - lens approximation to the source plane to form a ` magnification map ' that is sampled by the moving source star .     and",
    "@xmath42 to the right .",
    "the deviations were computed pixel - by - pixel as the difference in magnification produced by a star with and without a planet , normalised by the magnification without a planet .",
    "the coordinates shown are fractions of @xmath18 . also shown",
    "are typical tracks of a solar - like source star at @xmath43 .",
    "moire - like artefacts caused by the use of rectangular pixels are present .",
    "they are alternately positive and negative , and have small net effects when integrated over the source star.,width=302 ]    fig .",
    "2 above shows a magnification map for a typical high magnification event .",
    "the lens consists of a star at the origin and a planet on the positive @xmath44-axis at a distance @xmath25 of @xmath45 .",
    "the planet : star mass ratio @xmath24 is @xmath46 .",
    "this corresponds to a super - earth of about three earth masses if the lens star is an m or k dwarf .",
    "the map shows the pixel - by - pixel fractional perturbation caused by the planet .",
    "it is seen to be approximately @xmath47 for a large region extending to @xmath48 towards the planet , and approximately @xmath49 for a similarly large region extending to @xmath50 away from the planet .    also shown are three possible tracks of a source star at a typical inclination to the star : planet axis .",
    "the leftmost track is for a solar - like source star with impact parameter @xmath51 or @xmath52 . for the central track the impact parameter @xmath53 and @xmath54 by liebes s theorem ( 1964 ) .",
    "the righthand track corresponds to @xmath55 and @xmath56 . integrating ` by eye ' over",
    "the area of the source star indicates that the left and right trajectories with @xmath57 of 100 and 200 yield planetary perturbations approaching @xmath49 and @xmath47 respectively in magnitude .",
    "perturbations to light curves of order 10% are readily detectable when the magnification is @xmath58 , yet perturbations of the above type have not been extensively sought in planet searches to date .",
    "it should therefore be possible to increase the current detection rate of planets by making use of the large extent of the regions shown on the left and right sides of fig .",
    "2 .    at the centre of the map lies the ` stellar caustic ' .",
    "this is an approximately triangular closed curve of formally infinite magnification extending from the lens star towards the planet with length about @xmath59 , i.e. approximately the diameter of the source star shown in the figure .",
    "the true length of the caustic is @xmath60 ( han 2009 ) but this is not discernable on the map due to the finite size of the pixels .",
    "the caustic provides a means for detecting planets , but source star tracks that traverse it are subject to cancellations from neighbouring areas of opposing polarities . on the other hand , the areas to the left and right of the caustic do not suffer from cancellations to the same extent .",
    "in addition , they are longer , and therefore offer the prospect of more numerous traversals in any random sample of events .     and separation @xmath25 are @xmath46 and @xmath45 , as in fig . 2 , and the angle between the planet : star axis and the track of the source star is @xmath61 .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath21 is 0 , 0.002 , 0.005 , 0.01 or 0.02 respectively.,width=264 ]    magnification maps similar to that shown in fig .",
    "2 for heavier or lighter planets , at greater or smaller distances from the einstein ring , yield similar results .",
    "in order to further assess the detectability of low - mass planets , light curves were computed for a range of planet masses and separations .",
    "the light curves were generated by subdividing the source plane into three regions .",
    "a central region was used to construct the peaks of light curves ( approximately @xmath62 the fwhm ) at high resolution .",
    "a larger region was used to extend the light curves out to approximately @xmath63 at moderate resolution , and an outer region was used to further extend them to approximately @xmath64 at low resolution . the pixel size in each region , and the number of rays per pixel , were adjusted to keep numerical noise below the precision of typical data .",
    "the wings of the light curves beyond the outermost of the above regions were treated in the single lens approximation .",
    "limb darkening was included in the linear approximation with a limb darkening coefficient of 0.5 .",
    "the procedures were checked by comparison with published analyses of several events .    in order for a planetary deviation to be clearly identified on a light curve ,",
    "it is helpful if both the deviation and also a significant portion of the unperturbed light curve is observed .",
    "if we imagine an ideal search being executed with robotically controlled telescopes programmed to monitor the fwhms of selected events from sites of excellent seeing , than this requirement will favour events for which @xmath65 . as remarked in @xmath66 ,",
    "the duration of a typical planetary deviation is @xmath67 whereas @xmath33 is @xmath68 ( rattenbury et al .",
    "2002 ) . to sample both the deviation and the unperturbed light curve equally precisely , the deviation should occupy less than half the fwhm .",
    "this translates to @xmath69 or @xmath70 for a typical value of @xmath71 we note however that , in actual practice , the descending branch of the fwhm will tend to be more fully monitored than the ascending branch , and that coverage on the descending branch may usefully extend beyond the fwhm .",
    "we note also that some previously made planetary discoveries have suffered from less than complete coverage of the fwhm .",
    "3 shows typical planetary deviations .",
    "the planet : star mass ratio and separation are the same as those used in fig .",
    "fractional deviations are plotted for @xmath57 equal to 2,000 , 500 , 200 , 100 and 50 respectively .",
    "the first exhibits the double - spiked structure discussed above , and the others exhibit perturbations of the width and height predicted above . for the last one at @xmath72 the requirement that the planet be closer to the einstein ring than the length of the einstein arcs begins to break down , and the width of the perturbation is greater than predicted .    a number of plots similar to those in fig . 3 were constructed and examined .",
    "4 shows the dependence of planetary perturbations on impact parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 was chosen as the independent variable in this plot , rather than the equivalent parameter @xmath57 which approximately equals @xmath73 , because @xmath21 is uniformly populated in any unbiased sample of events , whereas @xmath57 is not .",
    "it is apparent that from fig .",
    "4 that , for all combinations of the other parameters , there is a drop in the fractional deviations for the smallest values of @xmath21 , i.e. for the largest magnifications .",
    "this is caused by the onset of the ` double - spike ' phenomenon discussed above .",
    "4 also shows the dependence of a typical planetary perturbation on the angle @xmath26 between the planet : star axis and the track of the source star .",
    "the dependence is essentially constant for angles larger than @xmath74 .     and @xmath75 showing enhanced sensitivity at negative values of @xmath21 and moderate magnifications.,width=291 ]    the dependence on the source - size parameter @xmath32 is also shown in fig .",
    "4 . for typical events with solar - like source stars in the galactic bulge , and main sequence m - k lens stars lying in the bulge or in the galactic disc",
    ", @xmath41 takes on values between about 0.0005 and 0.002 .",
    "it is seen that planetary deviations are greater for smaller values of @xmath41 , and they are quite low when @xmath41 is as large as 0.005 .",
    "the latter value is about the minimum possible value of @xmath41 if the source star is a giant .",
    "the dependence of typical planetary perturbations on the planet mass parameter @xmath24 is displayed in fig .",
    "@xmath24 was set equal to @xmath76 , @xmath46 or @xmath77 . for each value of @xmath24",
    "the value of @xmath25 was adjusted ( in increments of 0.05 ) to yield a fractional deviation of approximately 4% when a solar - like source star with @xmath78 was magnified 100 times ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "this procedure yielded approximate ranges of the variables @xmath80 and @xmath41 where planets are likely to be detectable .",
    "the value of 4% was chosen as approximately the minimum detectable fractional deviation currently being achieved with 0.3 - 1.3 m class follow - up telescopes .",
    "the above procedure yielded minimum detectable values of @xmath25 of approximately 0.95 , 0.85 and 0.7 for @xmath24 equal to @xmath76 , @xmath46 and @xmath77 respectively . for values of @xmath25 lying outside the einstein ring , the well - known @xmath25 to @xmath81 symmetry ( griest & safizadeh 1998 ) yields maximum detectable values of approximately 1.05 , 1.2 and 1.4 respectively .",
    "these limiting values of @xmath25 agree with those reported by han ( 2009 ) who assumed a minimum detectable fractional deviation of 5% .",
    "an increase in the breadth of the plots in fig .",
    "5 as @xmath24 decreases ( right to left ) is evident .",
    "this implies , irrespective of any details , that very low mass planets with @xmath82 and @xmath83 will be detectable in events distributed over a wider range of magnifications than heavier planets with @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in hunting for the lowest mass planets it will therefore be advantageous to monitor events with the broadest range of magnifications possible .",
    "we note that the detection efficiences at the above limiting values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are approximately 67% if only the fwhm s of light curves are monitored intensively .",
    "this follows because only those planets with planet : star axes at angles @xmath86 to the track of the source star are probed during the fwhm ( rattenbury et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we note also that the left panel of fig .",
    "5 exhibits a bias towards negative values of @xmath21 .",
    "this is caused by a co - operative effect between the stellar caustic at the origin and a pair of planetary caustics above and below the negative x - axis for a planet located just inside the einstein ring , as shown in fig .",
    "a similar effect occurs for planets located just outside the einstein ring and positive values of @xmath21 .",
    "these cooperative effects already aided discoveries of planets , in moa-2009-blg-266 ( muraki et al . 2011 ) and ogle-2012-blg-0461 ( c. han , private communication ) for example , and they could boost the detection rate of low mass planets in future events with magnifications of order a few to several tens . however , the lower magnifications of these events may need to be compensated by brighter source stars .",
    "the previous discussion can be extended by allowing for the relative precisions with which planetary deviations can be measured at different magnifications . as a first approximation we assume poisson statistics for the detected photons in any exposure , and multiply fractional deviations by the square root of amplification to approximate relative detectabilities .",
    "the results for the three @xmath87 combinations shown in fig .",
    "5 are reproduced below in figs .",
    "these include perturbations for negative impact parameters as well as the positive ones shown in fig .",
    "3 . they are almost mirror images of one another ( rattenbury et al . 2002 ) .     at various magnifications .",
    "the lines at @xmath88 are the estimated limits of detectability with telescopes currently in use as discussed in the text.,width=264 ]    the inclusion of the poisson factor tends to reverse the effect of the diminished deviations shown in fig .",
    "3 at large magnifications . in fig .",
    "7 the largest perturbation occurs at @xmath89 .",
    "although the peak signals at @xmath90 are larger in magnitude , their contributions to @xmath91 in a full analysis would be limited by the narrowness of the spikes .    the estimate made in  4 of a minimum detectable fractional deviation of 0.04 at @xmath92 with telescopes currently in use moves to 0.4 on figs .",
    "the calculated perturbations at @xmath52 are seen to be almost at the threshold , as expected .",
    "the results shown in figs . 8 and 9 for lighter planets closer to the einstein ring show the same trend that was found in fig .",
    "5 . the importance of lower magnification events grows until at ( @xmath93 events with magnifications from 50 - 500 are seen to provide approximately equal sensitivities on an event - by - event basis , with a slight preference for negative impact parameters over positive ones .",
    "when one allows for the greater frequency of events with lower magnifications , they are seen to provide the greatest discovery potential .     at various magnifications .",
    "estimated limits of detectability with current telescopes are shown at @xmath88.,width=264 ]     at various magnifications .",
    "the enhancement at negative impact parameters over positive ones results from the cooperative effect between stellar and planetary caustics discussed in  4.,width=264 ]    for planets even closer to the ring the advantage of working at lower magnification becomes more evident .",
    "10 shows results for @xmath94 .",
    "here it is seen that the sensitivity to sub - earths is significant at @xmath57 as low as 50 .     at various magnfications .",
    "the large enhancement at negative impact parameters results from the cooperative effect between stellar and planetary caustics described in  4.,width=264 ]    fig .",
    "10 exhibits the best of all worlds .",
    "the source star is highly magnified , the planet perturbs the highly magnified image , and the magnification is further enhanced by planetary caustics .",
    "moreover , these properties are predictable .",
    "every event with @xmath95 will enjoy these advantages and offer the prospect of detecting sub - earths close to the einstein ring if they are sufficiently abundant .",
    "to further quantify the detectability of low - mass planets in events of moderately high magnification a sample of simulated events was generated and fully analysed using standard procedures .",
    "the simulation was carried out assuming follow - up telescopes with apertures larger than those presently in use become available in the future .",
    "an expected distribution of events was generated by extrapolating the planetary mass function of cassan et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to planets with masses in the range @xmath96 and separations in the range 1.25 - 5.0 au .",
    "these ranges were subdivided into a @xmath97 array as shown in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t2 ]",
    "there are a large number of variables that differentiate one gravitational microlensing event from another .",
    "it is difficult to allow for every possible contingency even when discussing just one particular characteristic such as planet detection efficiency . in the preceding sections we considered those variables whose values are most likely to affect the detectability of low - mass planets in microlensing events of high magnification .",
    "we focused in particular on the peak value of the magnification @xmath57 , but also considered results for various values of the source - size parameter @xmath41 and the einstein radius crossing time @xmath16 .",
    "these variables are the only ones whose magnitudes are likely to be known with any degree of confidence prior to an event reaching peak magnification . on the basis of their values decisions",
    "may be made on whether or not to observe an event intensively .",
    "we have found that events with @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 days offer a sensitive hunting ground for low - mass planets provided their fwhm s are monitored continuously with 1 - 2 m class telescopes .",
    "the frequency of such events should enable selections to be made to avoid troublesome events such as those with variable or potentially spotty source stars , peak data taken partly in poor weather or under moonlight , or those with nearby bright stars .",
    "the planetary perturbations shown in the preceding sections are relatively featureless .",
    "it might therefore appear difficult to distinguish a perturbation caused by a light planet close to the einstein ring from that of a heavy planet further away . to quantify this effect we examined the accuracy with which planets could be recovered from their simulated light curves .",
    "figure 18 shows @xmath101 as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the light curve shown in fig . 12 in which @xmath102 was 5,206 . in this case the uncertainties in @xmath24 and @xmath25 are seen to be @xmath10310% and @xmath1033% at the @xmath104 level respectively .",
    "19 shows that the uncertainties grow to @xmath10350% and @xmath10310% for the borderline detection in fig .",
    "15 with @xmath102 was 304 .",
    "these analyses also yielded uncertainties of @xmath10320% and @xmath10330% for the above events at the @xmath104 level for the recovered value of the source size parameter @xmath41 .",
    "it is apparent from the above that the richest harvest of planets will occur in events where very low - mass planets are situated close to the einstein ring .",
    "this confirms the expectation given in section @xmath105 that was based on the breadth of the left panel of fig .",
    "it is also evident that definitive detections such as those shown in figs .",
    "10 and 11 require the use of 1 - 2 m class telescopes .",
    "as in other planetary detections by microlensing , measurements of orbital and/or terrestrial parallax can assist to extract absolute values of planetary masses and separations from the microlensing parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in this regard",
    "we note that orbital parallax is unlikely to be measurable in the events we have modelled with @xmath106 days , but that terrestrial parallax may be measurable in some cases .",
    "the rise and fall times of the planetary perturbations shown in fig .",
    "3 are relatively steep , of order 20 minutes .",
    "if these perturbations were intensively monitored from different continents and/or different hemispheres it might be possible to measure terrestrial parallax in some cases .",
    "however , we note that terrestrial parallax has been measured previously in events of very high magnification only ( gould et al . 2009 ; yee et al .",
    "2009 ) .      if two or more planetary deviations are present on a light curve , as the planetary mass function of cassan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggests could be the case when extrapolated to lower masses , it would be easier to identify the deviations if they are well separated .",
    "two conditions must be met to achieve the above .",
    "first , the projected position angles of the planets should differ by @xmath107 or more in order for the individual deviations not be superimposed on one another , and secondly @xmath33 must be several times the duration of an individual planetary deviation .",
    "this translates to @xmath108 approximately , as shown in fig .",
    "we note that multiplanet events have been reported previously ( gaudi et al , 2008 ; han et al .",
    "2013 ) in events with magnifications 100 and 290 respectively .",
    "however , the detected planets in these cases were all giants .",
    "in recent years the microlensing community has focussed attention on events with the highest observed magnifications , in particular on events with magnification @xmath109 ( gould et al .",
    "as mentioned in  1 this resulted in the discoveries of several planets by telescopes with apertures ranging from 0.3 m to 2.0 m .",
    "the detected planets have separations from their host stars of order a few au and correspondingly cool temperatures .",
    "their measured masses range from a few earth masses to a few jupiter masses .",
    "they provide a representative sample of the distribution of planets between us and the centre of the galaxy that orbit a relatively unbiased sample of host stars .",
    "the discoveries are important because other planetary detection techniques are insensitive to such planets . on the basis of these discoveries the first estimates of the abundances of cool planets in the milky way were made .    in an effort to build on these successes",
    "we have proposed a modified procedure for extending the measurements down to earth mass .",
    "the modified strategy makes use of the surprisingly good sensitivity of microlensing events with magnifications @xmath110 to low - mass planets situated close to the einstein ring .",
    "it was found that high quality detections of low - mass planets such as those depicted in figs .",
    "11 and 12 could may be made by densely monitoring the peaks of these events with 1 - 2 m class telescopes . if an extrapolation of the planetary mass function of cassan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) to earth mass is approximately valid , a statistically significant sample of detections could be made by monitoring some tens of events .    in recent years",
    "@xmath111 events with magnification @xmath109 have been detected by the moa and ogle collaborations annually .",
    "the inclusion of events with @xmath57 down to 50 should quadruple the event rate , and thus permit some tens of these events with moderately high magnifications to be monitored in good conditions relatively rapidly . in this way",
    "the planetary mass function could be measured down to earth - mass .",
    "in addition , sub - earths and planetary systems with more than one low - mass planet might be found .",
    "results obtained following the above procedure would provide an independent check of measurements made by monitoring events of low magnification ( kim et al . 2010 ) and of entirely independent results obtained from radial velocity ( howard et al .",
