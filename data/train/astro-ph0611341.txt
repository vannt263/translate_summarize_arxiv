    "a follow up observation with the chandra x - ray observatory allowed a fine x - ray position to be given at + soon after the discovery , we triggered our  program p92016 as well as radio observations with the australian telescope compact array ( atca ) , aiming to identify the nature of the system .",

    "the pca data were reduced in the same way as in @xcite , although with the latest version of the software package . since the source",
    "is located in a crowded area , standard background subtraction is not sufficient to remove the contribution of other sources and the galactic bulge ( about 10 mcrab between 2 - 10 kev , @xcite ) . in order to better estimate the sky background at the source position",

    "we checked that `` plus '' and `` minus '' offset pointings gave similar spectra ( indicating that no active sources contributed to the background ) and combined the two pointings to obtain background spectra .",
    "the remaining processes for hexte reduction are similar to the procedures presented in @xcite .",
    "the pca and hexte spectra of each observation were fitted simultaneously in v11.3.2 t between 3 and 200 kev .",
    "a normalization constant was introduced to account for calibration uncertainties between pca and the single hexte cluster .",
    "+ high resolution light curves were extracted from good xenon and event data with a time resolution of @xmath3s allowing us to study the temporal properties of the source up to 4096 hz . in order to restrict the background effects at low and high energies , we restricted the extraction to the @xmath4@xmath5 kev range .",
    "since qpos and coherent pulsations are usually stronger at these energies ( e.g. * ? ?",

    "the array was in the h75 configuration ( allowing a baseline as long as 6 km ) with antennas 1 and 5 off - line due to maintenance .",
    "observations were carried out simultaneously at 4.80 ghz ( 6 cm ) and 8.64 ghz ( 3.5 cm ) , with a continuum bandwidth of 128 mhz , for a total of about 12.3 hours on source .",
    "the amplitude and band - pass calibrator was pks  1934@xmath7638 , and the antennas gain and phase calibration , as well as the polarization leakage , were derived from regular observations of the nearby calibrator txs 1748@xmath7253 .",
    "the editing , calibration , fourier transformation , deconvolution , and image analysis were performed using the miriad software package ( sault & killen 1998 ) .",

    "[ fig : lite ] shows the light curves seen by swift / bat and /pca . in about 5 days the 15 - 50 kev bat flux increased by a factor greater than 5 , and remained around 0.02 cts / s until mjd 54006 .",

    "an f - test yielded a probability of 2.8@xmath1010@xmath11 that the improvement was purely due to chance . in all observations except 4 , 5 and 6",
    "the cutoff was required at a high level of significance .",
    "this may indicate that it was either truly absent in obs . 4 , 5 and 6 , or that the cutoff energy had increased closer to the upper boundary of our spectral analysis .",
    "note that these three observations occur between the two peaks of the bat light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lite ] ) .",
    "+ since a hard power law with an exponential cutoff is usually interpreted in xrbs as being due to thermal comptonization , the pure phenomenological model was replaced by the model @xcite .",

    "the mention by @xcite of such a feature in the _ suzaku _ spectrum of the source lent further credibility to this detection .",

    "the analogue of the break frequency is given by @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the full width at half maximum , and @xmath16 the centroid frequency @xcite .",

    "we analyzed a set of  observations of the newly - discovered source .",
    "the pdss of  are typical of xrbs in the lhs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although the general shape of the pdss makes it difficult to discriminate a ns from a bh @xcite , the typical frequencies are believed to be lower in the case of bh ( the ms accreting pulsar igr j00291 + 5934 being a recent counter example ) .",
    "in fact @xcite observed that in the lhs for bh systems no significant signal is detected above @xmath26 hz , contrary to weakly magnetized ns . in   the lack of significant signal above @xmath010 hz , , and the high level of the flat top noise together with the low frequency of the break",
    "are reminiscent of bh systems . generally speaking , and",
    "although this is not a proof , none of the characteristics that would make  a definite ns ( khz qpos , x - ray bursts , coherent pulsations ) are observed .",
    "+ the source spectrum is well represented by a power law ( with @xmath27 ) convolved by interstellar absorption and a high - energy cutoff , which are all typical of xrbs in the lhs .",
    "this is usually interpreted as due to thermal comptonization of soft x - ray photons on a population of energetic electrons .",
    "whether these electrons form a `` corona '' or the base of a compact jet is subject to debate .",
    "a thermal comptonization model represents the spectra well .",
    "the high value of the electron temperature and the optical depth , suggest that the compact object probably a bh . indeed , with @xmath28 , we obtain an equivalent cutoff energy of about 100 - 120 kev which is similar to e.g. cyg x-1 while in the lhs @xcite , or xte j1550@xmath7564 during its 2002 outburst @xcite ) , two well known bhs .",
    "in addition , even if some extremely hard ns atoll sources can show similar spectra , the values of @xmath29 obtained in those cases are systematically higher @xcite than those of .",
    "+ the ( unabsorbed ) 1 - 20 and 20 - 200 kev luminosities are @xmath30erg / s and @xmath31erg / s . at the distance of the galactic center , these luminosities place the source outside the so - called burster box @xcite , in fact very close to cyg x-1 in its lhs .",
    "although several ns sources have been seen to lie outside this box , they all have their 20200 kev luminosity lower than @xmath32erg / s . in this respect ,",
    "if  is located at a large distance , as possibly suggested by the high value of the equivalent absorption column density , its hard luminosity strongly suggests that it contains a bh .",

    "fig [ fig : correl ] ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that some bh(c)s have been observed to lie below the expected correlation .",
    "the non - detection of  in radio is therefore not an argument against a bh primary .",
    "given the results of our x - ray spectral analysis , we conclude that  is a bhc in its lhs .",
    "+ recently several sources have been observed to remain in the lhs during the whole duration of their outburst .",
    "these sources can either a ns ( e.g. aql x-1 ) , or a bh(c ) ( xte j1550@xmath7564 , , gro j0422 + 32 , gro j1719 - 24 , and xte j1118 + 480 ; @xcite )",
    ". interestingly aql x-1 and xte j1550@xmath7564 are also known to undergo major outbursts .",
    "the existence of lhs outbursts in xrbs brings interesting questions regarding the physics of accretion . in xte j1550@xmath7564 , @xcite",
    "have suggested that this outburst could correspond to a discrete accretion event . @xcite",
    "have suggested the same could also occur in aql x-1 . in both these cases , the outbursts had a short duration ( @xmath030 - 40 days ) compared to their previous outbursts .",
    "the similar duration of the outburst of  could by comparison indicate that a similar event took place .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite the lhs outburst in gro j0422 + 32 , gro j1719 - 24 , and xte j1118 + 480 could ( by opposition to at least xte j1550@xmath7564 ) be explained by a lower reservoir of material , these sources having a short orbital periods .",
