    "the first generation of large interferometric gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors @xcite is producing a growing set of experimental results , showing that the detectors already built are coming close to their foreseen sensitivities .",
    "therefore , it is very important to consider exchanging data and perform analysis in common .",
    "such network data analysis methods are compulsory to separate  with a sufficient confidence level  real gw transient signals from noise occurring in one particular detector .",
    "gw burst signals have usually a small duration ( a few ms ) and a poorly known shape : for instance , type ii supernovae or the merging phase of coalescing compact binary systems belong to this category .",
    "as they are not accurately modeled , only suboptimal methods @xcite can be used to detect them .",
    "therefore , various related outputs coming from a set of interferometers are required to reach a definite conclusion on the reality of the gw event .",
    "in addition to the definition of efficient filters suitable to analyze single interferometer outputs , it is also necessary to estimate the performances of different network data analysis methods . studying this problem with monte - carlo simulations is the goal of this paper .",
    "network data analysis methods can be classified into two categories : coincidence or coherent filtering .",
    "the first method is simpler to use and has been already considered for years . in this approach",
    ", each interferometer belonging to the network analyzes separately its own data and produces a list of selected events , characterized by their timing and their maximum signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) exceeding some suitable threshold levels . in a second step ,",
    "these events are correlated with those found by other detectors in order to see if some are compatible with a real gw source .",
    "many articles in the literature @xcite deal with this topic , in particular with real data taken by resonant bar experiments @xcite .    as pointed out independently @xcite",
    ", such coincidence analyzes are not optimal in the sense that their binary use of interferometer data ( a gw signal in a given detector is either present or absent ) leaves aside important information on the possible correlations between the different datasets .",
    "indeed , as the detector beam patterns are not uniform @xcite , the interaction between the physical signal and a given interferometer depends on the relative location of the source .",
    "thus , the gw amplitude scales differently in the various components of the network causing , in addition to noise fluctuations , the filtered outputs to exceed or not the selection threshold .",
    "these large variations of the gw response could suppress even a strong gw signal in a given interferometer@xcite . in a coherent analysis ,",
    "all detector outputs contribute to the filtering algorithm . triggered and merged in a suitable way",
    ", a higher statistical significance can be achieved compared to individual analyzes , thus improving the network detection potential .",
    "coherent methods have already been studied in the literature , particularly for the search of signals with known waveforms . both ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite consider network data analysis methods based on a likelihood function , which turn out to be direct extensions of the wiener filtering , optimal for a single detector search when the signal shape is known .",
    "coincidence and coherent detections have been compared in a two - detector network @xcite , with a simple model describing its interaction with a gw burst signal ( two sinusoid cycles ) .",
    "the coherent search was found to be always better than the coincidence method and the results are robust with respect to the noise statistics . ref .",
    "@xcite , later extended in @xcite , deals with in - spiral waveforms at newtonian order .",
    "a new formalism is developed based on a likelihood function , in a way very similar to matched filtering , but now with a parameter space containing two more unknowns which correspond to the source position in the sky : consequently , the data analysis procedure becomes more computationally expensive .",
    "@xcite applied then this framework to post - newtonian inspiral waveforms and to the case of a non - gaussian noise .",
    "the present study takes advantage of these pioneering works and applies the same kind of methods for gw bursts , using the network detection model originally developed in @xcite to study coincidences between interferometers . on the one hand , this framework is simple enough to perform a large number of monte - carlo simulations , and thus to compare accurately coincident and coherent detections . on the other hand ,",
    "all the features characterizing the interaction between a gw and a network of interferometers are properly taken into account : non uniform angular pattern of the detectors , propagation time delays between them and data sampling .    as an efficient detection algorithm must be",
    "a good compromise between a high detection probability and a low false alarm rate , a standard tool to estimate the performances of a data analysis method is to use roc ( _ receiver operating characteristics _ ) .",
    "such diagrams present the detection probability of a given signal ( scaled at a particular snr ) versus the false alarm rate .",
    "section [ section : hyp_notations ] summarizes the general framework of this study , specifying the network detection model used in all the simulations presented in this paper , and the tools used .",
    "the single detector performances  detection efficiency and timing resolution  are briefly recalled in section [ section : single ] as they are the basis for the following investigations .",
    "then , the network coincidence analysis is studied in section [ section : coincidences ] .",
    "roc studies for networks from two to six detectors  comprising the large interferometers currently being developed , geo600 @xcite , the two 4-km ligo detectors and the 2-km interferometer located in hanford @xcite , tama300 @xcite , virgo @xcite and finally the foreseen aciga project @xcite  are presented . to decide whether or not a coincidence is valid , two different compatibility conditions are considered .",
    "the first one , called loose condition , does not require the knowledge of the source position in the sky while the second one , the tight condition , does .",
    "section [ section : coherent_analysis ] deals with the coherent analysis .",
    "first , the derivation of the likelihood statistics follows closely the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite ; then , the corresponding roc for coherent search of gw bursts are presented . as coherent",
    "filtering requires the knowledge of the source location in the sky , a set of coherent filters must be used in parallel to cover the full celestial sphere .",
    "therefore , section [ section : sky_tiling ] estimates the number @xmath0 of such templates needed for a complete tiling of the sky , given a prescription on the maximal loss of snr allowed .",
    "knowing @xmath0 allows one to tabulate the false alarm rate of the coherent roc .",
    "finally , section [ section : comparison ] compares the two network data analysis methods considered in this article .",
    "measuring the strength of a signal with respect to the background noise is not the only information needed to estimate how well a gw may be detected in an interferometric detector .",
    "as the angular pattern of an antenna is not uniform , it is also necessary to take into account the location of the source in the sky .",
    "the result @xmath1 of the interaction between the wave and the instrument is a linear combination of the two gw polarizations @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite :          ( s2 ) the source location in the sky , given for instance by the celestial sphere coordinates ( the right ascension @xmath7 and the declination @xmath8 ) and the local sidereal time which takes into account the earth proper rotational motion .",
    "( s3 ) a vector of physical parameters describing the time evolution of the gw signal .",
    "some may be estimated at the output of the data analysis procedure , but this always requires adding some hypothesis on the signal .",
    "the polarization angle @xmath9 is also included in this set .    in fact , the signal dependence on @xmath9 can be explicitly extracted . for an interferometer",
    ", one has : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 only depend on the sets ( s1 ) and ( s2 ) @xcite , and with @xmath13 being the angle between the two arms of the interferometer .",
    "monte - carlo simulations @xcite are used to compare the detection performances of coincident and coherent data analysis methods in various network configurations .",
    "as this paper aims at studying the consequences of the interferometer location on earth rather than the effect of the current or foreseen differences in their sensitivities to gw , the network model uses the simplifying assumption of identical detection performances . in this way , all interferometers contribute equally to the network .    yet , in section [",
    "subsection : ligo_network ] , a difference in the interferometer sensitivities is introduced in a complementary study , investigating the case of non - identical detectors .",
    "the ligo network ( made of three interferometers , the two 4-km in hanford and livingston , and the 2-km in hanford ) is well - suited to this work : as the gw sensitivity should scale with the arm length , the 2-km detector should ultimately be half as sensitive as the two other ligo interferometers . as this computation shows an important loss of efficiency induced by this difference in sensitivity , the hanford 2-km detector is not considered elsewhere in this article .",
    "the ( s1 ) parameters of the detectors are chosen to match the already existing or planned instruments ; as the local orientation of aciga is not yet defined , it has been optimized to maximize the detection efficiency in the full network of interferometers @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 interferometers , labeled in the following by the index @xmath15 , are assumed to have many features in common : the interaction with a gw signal  as defined in section [ subsection : itf_gw ] above  , the sampling frequency @xmath16 , and the noise characteristics .",
    "all noises are taken to be gaussian , white and uncorrelated with the same rms : @xmath17 .",
    "finally , the interferometers are assumed to be properly synchronized .",
    "any correlation between a filtering function @xmath18 and the output @xmath19 of the @xmath15-th interferometer at time @xmath20 ( the sampling time at the origin of the analyzing windows ) is represented in the time domain by the following quantity :        the gw signal @xmath18 is assumed to be a gaussian peak of half - width @xmath23  ms : @xmath24 .",
    "such pulse - like shapes are characteristic of the most common gw burst waveforms simulated numerically : see e.g.@xcite for the case of supernova signals . its amplitude with respect to the background noise is monitored by its optimal snr @xmath25 @xcite : the average value of the filter output , computed in a noisy background with both the wiener filtering method and a detector optimally oriented . in the following ,",
    "we mainly focus on weak signals for which detection problems are likely .",
    "we also assume that the sources are uniformly distributed over the sky , with a random timing .",
    "finally , matched filtering is used to simulate the detection process .      a convenient way to estimate the capability of a given filter to detect a particular gw signal  whose amplitude is fixed according to a chosen value of the maximum snr @xmath25  is the roc , which presents on a single plot the detection efficiency @xmath26 versus the filter false alarm rate @xmath27 obtained by varying the threshold @xmath28 . following the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider in the rest of this paper a false alarm rate _ per bin _ :          for the coincidence analysis framework presented in this paper , the event compatibility is tested by comparing the delays between the triggered events for every pair of detectors . in case of a real gw signal ( detected in two detectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 at times @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    "respectively ) , the time difference is related to the source position in the sky .",
    "let @xmath37 be the unit vector pointing from the earth center to the gw source location .",
    "one has :        two compatibility tests can be set from eq .",
    "( [ eq : delay ] ) for coincidence analysis : the first one  the loose test  does not assume that the source location in the sky is known while the other ",
    "the tight test uses this additional information .",
    "the former case allows one to survey the whole sky with one single analysis , but at the price of a lower efficiency , whereas the latter can reject more false coincidence events with a more stringent compatibility condition .",
    "let us first consider a full sky search without any knowledge on the gw source location in the sky .",
    "the timing delay @xmath39 between detectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 must obey the following inequality :      with the term on the right side of the inequality being the light time travel between the two detectors .",
    "table  i shows the maximum delays between all pairs of interferometers .",
    "the largest distance is between ligo livingston and aciga , about 42  ms ."
