    "it is well known that the existence of a magnetic field will affect the phase of electrically - charged particles , even when the particles do not pass through the region containing the magnetic field .",

    "then we see that the aharonov - bohm phase is given by a pairing @xmath13 defined as @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "when we consider d - branes , however , things are not so simple . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "it was shown that d - brane charges and ramond - ramond ( rr ) fields in types iia , iib , and i theories are classified by k - theory .",
    "therefore , the calculation of aharonov - bohm phases for d - branes will necessarily involve some sort of k - theoretic pairing .    in this paper , sections 2.1 - 2.4",
    "produce a number of details concerning the topological formulation of d - brane aharonov - bohm phases in type iia theory , building off of a brief speculative discussion in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the pairing outlined in @xcite exists and is well - defined .",
    "section 2.5 provides adaptations of this pairing to the type iib and type i settings . in section 3 , the focus shifts to the use of the reduced eta - invariant as a means for calculating the k - theoretic pairing .",
    "a brief overview of relevant mathematical technology is presented in section 3.1 and then utilized in section 3.2 for the @xmath0 system in type i theory .",
    "it is shown that our result agrees with a calculation performed in @xcite using different methods .",
    "let us begin by considering type iia theory on @xmath14 , and suppose we have a brane producing a torsion flux .",
    "this flux defines an element of @xmath15 , the torsion subgroup of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "we next wish to lift our element of @xmath15 to an element of @xmath18 . before doing this , it is useful to consider the analogous cohomological situation . from the exact coefficient sequence @xmath19",
    "we may obtain the long exact cohomological sequence @xmath20 where the maps @xmath21 are called the bockstein homomorphisms .",
    "since @xmath22 for any @xmath23 , the kernel of @xmath24 is the set of torsion elements of @xmath25 , denoted @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we may write the following exact sequence , @xmath27 thus for any torsion class there is a lift in @xmath28 .",
    "this lift is an integral cochain that is closed in @xmath29 but not in @xmath30 .",
    "simple diagram - chasing shows that this lift is well - defined @xcite .",
    "a completely analogous argument goes through in k - theory .",
    "indeed , one may write a long exact sequence similar to that above , and all subsequent statements and actions carry over . specifically , the long exact sequence @xmath31 gives the exact sequence @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the chern character and @xmath34 is the forgetful map .",
    "lifting an element of @xmath35 via the bockstein @xmath34 then gives an element of @xmath36 .",
    "as in the cohomological case , diagram - chasing shows that this lift is well - defined .",
    "next , note that the test brane defines an element of @xmath37 .",
    "we will pair this with our element of @xmath36 via the k - cup product @xcite .",
    "again we begin by considering the analogous cohomological case . there",
    ", one starts with a mapping @xmath38 which assigns to each @xmath39-cochain @xmath40 and @xmath41-cochain @xmath42 a @xmath43-cochain @xmath44 by letting @xmath40 act on the front @xmath39-face and @xmath42 act on the @xmath41-back face , then multiplying the results by the usual product operation sending @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "it follows that @xmath47 gives a well - defined product operation @xcite",
    "@xmath48    in k - theory , we define a similar product operation via tensor products of bundles . the external k - cup product is a group morphism @xmath49 which assigns to each @xmath50 the element @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the projection operators .",
    "when extended to higher k - groups , this product becomes @xmath54 . to see this",
    ", we start with a pairing @xmath55 given by tensor product .",
    "next we use the defined relationship @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is @xmath58 with a disjoint basepoint and @xmath59 is the smash product of @xmath60 with @xmath58 .",
    "then we obtain a pairing @xmath61 .    letting @xmath62 and",
    "then composing with the map from @xmath63 to @xmath64 induced by the diagonal map @xmath65 gives the product @xmath66 it follows that there is a pairing @xmath67 with @xmath68 as in the cohomological case .",
    "we see that we may therefore pair @xmath69 via the k - cup product with generalized coefficients . thus , given a brane producing a torsion flux and a charged test brane",
    ", we obtain an element of @xmath36 .      to measure the aharonov - bohm phase at infinity , we must move the test brane on a closed path in @xmath58 .",
    "this path defines an element of @xmath70 . in order to pair our path with @xmath36 , we must lift the path to an element of @xmath71 , the k - homology of @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "we may parametrize our path by a function @xmath72 . note that @xmath73 is a compact @xmath74-manifold without boundary , and @xmath75 is by definition a continuous map . to put a complex vector bundle on @xmath73",
    "is easy , since every complex vector bundle on @xmath73 is trivial .",
    "it is natural , then , to let a k - cycle associated with our path be given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the trivial complex vector bundle with fibre @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath73 is odd - dimensional , we have defined an element of @xmath71 .    to show that this lift is unique",
    ", we use the bordism and direct sum relations . consider the k - cycle @xmath79 . since @xmath80 the direct sum relation gives @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath82 be the compact 2-dimensional @xmath83-manifold shown in figure 2 , and put the trivial rank 1 complex vector bundle on it",
    ".     carries the trivial rank 1 complex vector bundle on it , and serves as a bordism between @xmath84 and two copies of @xmath85.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    then for appropriate choice of continuous @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 hence @xmath88 clearly this generalizes to any k - cycle @xmath89 .",
    "thus our lift from @xmath90 to @xmath71 is unique .      in the cohomological case",
    ", there is an intersection pairing on a compact oriented @xmath91-dimensional manifold @xmath58 @xmath92 defined by @xmath93\\rangle\\ ] ] i.e. , cup product followed by integration over an orientation class @xmath94 \\in h_n ( x;{{\\mathbb{z}}})$ ] .",
    "we use this to define another pairing @xmath95 in the following way . since any torsion class @xmath96 \\in h^{n - k+1}_{tors}(x;{{\\mathbb{z}}})$ ] has a well - defined lift @xmath97\\in h^{n - k}(x;u(1))$ ]",
    ", we may define the desired pairing as @xmath98\\rangle \\in u(1).\\ ] ]    returning to the k - theoretic case , recall that from our torsion flux , test brane , and path of the test brane we have defined elements of @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "we would now like to pair these elements and get an element of @xmath29 , the aharonov - bohm phase .",
    "this is achieved with the use of the so - called intersection form @xcite .",
    "the intersection form is the nondegenerate pairing @xmath101 ( with @xmath102 denoting compact support ) which is induced by the k - cup product and the direct image mapping @xmath103 corresponding to the map @xmath104 .    poincar duality and the thom isomorphism give @xcite , @xmath105 to see this isomorphism topologically , first let @xmath106 denote the unit sphere bundle of @xmath107 .",
    "also let @xmath108 be the projection .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that elements of @xmath109 are in one - to - one correspondence with stable homotopy classes of self - adjoint symbols on @xmath58 .",
    "then an element of @xmath109 is a pair @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a hermitian vector bundle on @xmath58 and @xmath112 is a self - adjoint automorphism of @xmath113 .",
    "then @xmath114 gives the decomposition @xmath115 where @xmath116 is spanned by the eigenvectors with @xmath117 eigenvalues of @xmath114 .",
    "setting @xmath118 , note that @xmath119 so that it is odd - dimensional .",
    "furthermore , @xmath120 is a @xmath83-manifold since @xmath121 has a @xmath83 structure from @xmath122 .",
    "then the triple @xmath123 is an element of @xmath71 .",
    "if we define @xmath124 , then @xmath125 is an isomorphism .",
    "thus the intersection form is a nondegenerate pairing between k - homology and k - theory , @xmath126 this is precisely what we need to give the aharonov - bohm phase .    to summarize our formulation for the type iia case ,",
    "the torsion flux defined an element of @xmath35 which we lifted to @xmath36 by the long exact sequence of k - groups associated with the exact coefficient sequence .",
    "the test brane defined an element of @xmath37 which we paired with our element of @xmath36 via the k - cup product to again get an element of @xmath36 .",
    "the path of our test brane defined an element of @xmath127 which we lifted to an element of @xmath128 .",
    "the intersection form then took @xmath129 , which we call the aharonov - bohm phase .",
    "now that we have given the topological details of the k - theoretic formula for aharonov - bohm phase in the type iia case , we would like to develop similar statements for the type iib and type i cases .    in the type iib situation ,",
    "the torsion flux takes values in @xmath130 , with @xmath131 as before",
    ". then we may again use the exact coefficient sequence to give a long exact sequence of k - groups and lift our element of @xmath132 to @xmath133 .",
    "now our test brane defines an element of @xmath134 , and we again use the k - cup product to pair these elements as @xmath135 again we lift the path of the test brane from @xmath90 to @xmath71 and use the intersection form to pair @xmath136    finally , we may make a similar proposal in the type i scenario . here",
    ", the torsion flux is valued in @xmath137 , and the test brane defines an element of @xmath138 .",
    "all the properties of the complex k - theory that we employed carry over to the ko - groups .",
    "the only real difference between these theories is the form of bott periodicity , but that does not seriously affect our discussion .",
    "so we lift the torsion flux to @xmath139 , then pair the test brane charge to it @xmath140 by a ko - cup product which is completely analogous to the k - cup product .",
    "we can complexify to obtain an element of @xmath36 .",
    "now we lift the path of the test brane from @xmath90 to @xmath71 .",
    "then we use the intersection form to pair @xmath141 giving us the aharonov - bohm phase .",
    "some explanation is required to justify labelling this @xmath29 as an aharonov - bohm phase .",
    "the question is whether this phase occurs within the partition function for a d - brane that participates in an aharonov - bohm experiment .",
    "the interaction between the pair of d - branes involved in such an experiment will be mediated by open strings connecting the two branes , and to produce an aharonov - bohm phase they must be sensitive to their relative orientations . only fermions which become massless when the branes coincide are capable of detecting their relative orientations . while the neveu - schwarz sector open string zero point energy is sometimes greater than zero @xcite",
    ", ramond - sector open strings always have a zero point energy equal to zero .",
    "therefore , there will be massless fermions whose sensitivity to relative orientation will affect the partition function , generating an aharonov - bohm phase .    in the type i case",
    ", these open string interactions can be viewed from the perspective of the effective gauge theory defined on the worldvolume of 9-branes used to construct the d - brane system .",
    "the two d - branes correspond to topological defects in the gauge bundle defined on the 9-brane system , and the k - theoretic pairing specified above measures the topological phase induced by the relative motion of the defects .",
    "we shall return to this gauge bundle perspective later , in section 3.2 .",
    "here we describe the pairing @xmath142 from an analytic point of view .",
    "we begin by reviewing relevant material from @xcite to define the reduced eta - invariant , and relate it to the topological pairing from section 2 .",
    "we then use the eta - invariant to calculate the phase for an aharonov - bohm experiment involving a @xmath0 brane system in type i theory .",
    "first we define a @xmath143-graded cocycle in @xmath144 to be a quadruple @xmath145 , where :    * @xmath146 is a @xmath143-graded vector bundle on @xmath58 * @xmath147 is a hermitian metric on @xmath148 * @xmath149 is a hermitian connection on @xmath148 * @xmath150 satisfies @xmath151 .",
    "we may define a @xmath152-graded cocycle in @xmath153 analogously , by replacing the adjectives `` complex '' and `` hermitian '' with `` real '' and `` symmetric , '' respectively .",
    "next , recall that a k - cycle in @xmath71 is a triple @xmath154 with @xmath155 a closed odd - dimensional @xmath74-manifold , @xmath111 a complex vector bundle on @xmath155 , and @xmath156 a continuous map .",
    "we will in fact let @xmath75 be smooth here .",
    "again note that there is an analogous real formulation .",
    "for the rest of this subsection , however , we ll restrict our attention to the complex case .",
    "since @xmath155 is @xmath74 , the principle @xmath157-bundle on @xmath155 may be reduced to a principle @xmath74-bundle , call it @xmath158 .",
    "we may associate to @xmath158 a hermitian line bundle @xmath159 on @xmath155 @xcite . choose a hermitian connection @xmath160 on l , a hermitian metric @xmath161 on @xmath111 , and a hermitian connection @xmath162 on @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath163 be the closed form representing @xmath164 .",
    "also , let @xmath165 \\in \\omega^{even}(m)$ ] be the closed form representing @xmath166 \\in h^{even}(m;{{\\mathbb{q}}})$ ] .",
    "finally , let the spinor bundle of @xmath155 be @xmath167",
    ".      finally , given a cycle @xmath175 in @xmath71 and a @xmath143-graded cocycle @xmath176 for @xmath144 , their @xmath173-valued pairing is @xmath177,[\\mathcal{v } ] \\rangle = \\bar{\\eta}(f^*\\mathcal{v}).\\ ] ] the proof that this is in fact the correct pairing is given in @xcite , and is based largely on the corresponding proof in @xcite .",
    "we claim that this yields the aharonov - bohm phase as @xmath178    note that we can use the d - brane charges instead of the rr fields in our prescriptions . the k - theory class associated with an rr - field",
    "may be mapped in a well - defined way to the k - theory class associated with the d - brane charge via the isomorphism @xmath179 where @xmath180 restricts a k - theory class from @xmath155 to @xmath181 .",
    "the analogous isomorphism holds for the ko - theory as well .",
    "therefore , if desired we may change our prescriptions to begin with the k - theory classes associated with the charges of the d - branes .",
    "we now consider an aharonov - bohm experiment for a @xmath0 system of type i d - branes .",
    "the path of the instanton defines the k - cycle @xmath182 as discussed above .",
    "we use the 32 nine - branes required for tadpole cancellation to construct our system without adding extra branes / antibranes",
    ". it will be convenient to work from the k - theory classes of the d - brane charges instead of those of the rr fields .",
    "the 8-brane determines the non - trivial element of @xmath183 , which we view as @xmath184 with compact support .",
    "such an element is given by the pair @xmath185 where @xmath186 is a rank 1 bundle and @xmath187 is the trivial rank 0 bundle . we lift this via the bockstein to an element @xmath188 .",
    "note that @xmath189 is also a rank 1 bundle .",
    "next , the ( -1)-brane determines an element of @xmath190 .",
    "this is the pair @xmath191 .",
    "taking the ko - cup product we get @xmath192 . after complexifying these bundles",
    ", we then obtain a @xmath143-graded cocycle @xmath193 in @xmath194 .",
    "we also have the associated dirac operator along @xmath155 for the @xmath195 component of the cocycle , @xmath196 where @xmath197 parametrizes @xmath155 as the distance between the 8-brane and the ( -1)-brane as above , and the @xmath198 superscript indicates that it corresponds to the @xmath199 component . since @xmath189 is a rank 1 bundle , the index theorem @xcite says that @xmath200 has one zero mode of definite chirality with respect to @xmath201 and @xmath202 ( in the non - trivial instanton number sector ) .",
    "thus @xmath203 has eigenvalue @xmath197 .",
    "our analytic pairing can be evaluated by using the pullback via @xmath75 of @xmath204 from @xmath58 to @xmath155 .",
    "since the eigenvalue of @xmath203 is equal to @xmath197 , we get @xmath205 .",
    "also , since @xmath206 and @xmath189 are each @xmath207-bundles , their connection and curvature forms are @xmath208-valued , hence have zero trace .",
    "complexification does not change this , so that the chern character of @xmath148 is zero . then since @xmath209 and @xmath210 , we get @xmath211 and @xmath212 . finally , note that @xmath213 since @xmath214 .",
    "then we find that our pairing gives @xmath215 consequently , we get an aharonov - bohm phase of @xmath216 , and the monodromy is @xmath217",
    ".    this result agrees with the calculation performed in @xcite for the @xmath0 system , which was performed by examining changes in massless fermionic contributions to the amplitude as the instanton is moved .",
    "in this paper we have developed formulae to calculate the aharonov - bohm phase of torsion ramond - ramond fluxes in the type ii and type i string theories based upon the k - theoretic classification of ramond - ramond fields and d - brane charges .",
    "these formulae were constructed in two different but equivalent fashions , one being purely topological and the other employing the reduced eta - invariant .",
    "the topological pairing was shown to exist and be well - defined .",
    "the analytic perspective was used to calculate the phase for the @xmath0 system in type i theory , allowing us to test our forumlae by comparison with independent calculations .",
