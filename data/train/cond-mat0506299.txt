    "high - energy , ideal spherical models present regular protrusions on the surface . when compared to a faceted grain of the same size",

[ fig_8](a ) and ( b ) show , respectively , displacement vectors for two low - frequency , localized ( @xmath73 ) phonon modes in n=459 spherical and multigrain samples .",
    "these phonon modes are among those responsible for the low - frequency peaks in @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] ) .",
    "we find the following .",
    "( i ) in the spherical grain , the phonon mode is one of a three - fold degenerate set with frequency @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "this mode is mostly localized in the 6-atom protrusions that decorate the hexagonal , [ 111 ] facets of the underlying to grain ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] and sec .",

    "the amplitude of the displacement vectors of the atoms in the protrusions is _ different _ depending on which facet the protrusion is located , as indicated by solid , thick- and thin - stem arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig_8](a ) , whereas displacement vectors of atoms in diametrically opposed protrusions have the same amplitude but different phase .",
    "note that in this phonon mode [ fig .",
    "[ fig_8](a ) ] the single - atom protrusions located on top of [ 001 ] facets have negligible displacement - vector amplitude ( open arrows ) .",
    "( ii ) the phonon mode in the multigrain sample [ fig .",
    "[ fig_8](b ) ] is the lowest allowed phonon .",
    "its frequency is @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the displacement vectors with significant amplitude locate around a vertex vacancy , indicated with an arrow , and along grain boundaries .",
    "to understand in detail the vibrational properties of nanoscopic metal grains we performed atomistic simulations of the phonon spectra  frequencies and displacement vectors  of silver grains with realistic morphologies .",
    "our results show that morphology introduces a high degree of complexity into the phonon spectra , total and partial vibrational density of states , and phonon localization .",
    "the most prominent features are the following .",
    "( a ) low - energy , single - crystalline grains present nearly - pure torsional and radial phonon modes . the grains sharp edges and",
    "atomic lattice split off the acoustic gap quintet predicted by et into a doublet and triplet , with a magnitude that depends on the relative number of atoms at the boundary of different facets . when compared to faceted grains of the same size ,",
    "high - energy , spherical models that present regular protrusions on the surface have a smaller acoustic gap and a higher total dos at frequencies @xmath6 .",
    "( b ) twined icosahedra also have a breathing mode .",
    "strain in these grains leads to a higher acoustic gap , and a high - frequency tail in the dos that originates from core atoms .",
    "this tail extends beyond the highest frequency in single - crystalline grains .",
    "remarkably , _ neither _ twined and strained mark s decahedra have a breathing mode nor do they exhibit a high - frequency tail on the dos .",
    "( c ) nanograins with grain boundaries and surface disorder do not have degenerate frequencies and the acoustic gap is significantly reduced .",
    "these nanograins are the only ones that exhibit low - frequency @xmath1 dos in the interval 1 - 2@xmath2 .",
    "the extent of this region depends on the nature of disorder .    these predictions ,",
    "while illustrated here for silver , should be valid for other nanoscopic metal grains .",
    "our simulations show the complexity of the vibrational properties of metal nanograins , and point out similarities between the vibrational density of states of metal nanograins with grain boundaries and surface disorder and that of massive nanocrystalline samples .",
    "finally , this work is a necessary step toward understanding the size - dependent electron - phonon coupling in nanoscopic metals .",
