    "it is now generally assumed that the optical afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) arise from synchrotron emission in the post - shocked gas of a relativistic blast wave ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "there is credible evidence that grbs are strongly collimated or beamed explosions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "synchrotron radiation is intrinsically polarized , and the synchrotron emission from a jet will have a net polarization if its axis does not coincide with the line of sight . a natural consequence of models for beamed afterglows is time - variable polarization , which will depend on the viewing geometry as well as the degree of orientation of the magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , up to a maximum polarization of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "optical imaging polarimetry has been performed for a handful of grb afterglows to search for this signature .",
    "the results have been either upper limits @xcite or detections at @xmath5 @xcite , except for an observation of grb 020405 by @xcite that detected @xmath6 polarization 1.3 days after the burst .",
    "grb 020813 , a typical long - duration burst with a series of pulses , was detected by _",
    "hete-2 _  at 2:44 ut on 2002 august 13 @xcite , and an associated optical transient ( ot )",
    "was promptly identified @xcite .",
    "the rapid localization allowed us to begin spectropolarimetric observations less than 5 hours after the burst was initially detected .",
    "these are the first spectropolarimetric observations obtained for a grb afterglow .",
    "preliminary descriptions of this dataset were given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the observations were obtained with the dual - beam lris spectropolarimeter ( lrisp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the keck - i telescope , and a slit width of 1 .",
    "the addition of a new ultraviolet polarizing calibration filter to lrisp allowed us for the first time to take advantage of the full available wavelength range of lrisp using both the blue and red cameras .",
    "we used a 400 lines mm@xmath7  grism on the blue side of the spectrograph and a 400 lines mm@xmath7  grating on the red side , giving a wavelength scale of 1.09   pixel@xmath7  over 32005800   in the blue and 1.86 pixel@xmath7  over 56009400   in the red .",
    "the red and blue beams were separated with a dichroic beamsplitter having 50% transmission at 5700  .",
    "we began exposures of the ot associated with grb 020813 on 2002 august 13 at 7:23 ut , when its brightness was @xmath8 mag .",
    "the total exposure time was 3 hours , broken into individual 15-minute exposures .",
    "each pair of consecutive exposures gives one of the stokes parameters @xmath9 ( with the half - wave plate oriented at 0  and 45 ) or @xmath10 ( 225 and 675 ) , and the 4 exposures taken together are used to determine the degree and position angle of linear polarization ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "we refer to these three sets of four exposures each as the `` hour 1 '' , `` hour 2 '' , and `` hour 3 '' data .",
    "the airmass was 1.31.5 during the observations , and before starting each hour s exposures the spectrograph was rotated to place the slit at the parallactic angle for the midpoint of the hour .",
    "seeing was @xmath13 , and there were intermittent thin clouds during the observations .",
    "as a probe of the galactic interstellar polarization ( isp ) , we also observed the a2v star hd 187330 , which is located 647 from the line of sight to the grb .",
    "its apparent magnitude ( @xmath14 mag ) implies a distance of @xmath15 pc ; this is sufficiently distant to probe the majority of the galactic isp for a galactic latitude of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "distant a - type stars are useful as probes of isp because of their brightness and low intrinsic polarization , although ideally a smaller angular separation from the ot would be desirable .",
    "the data were reduced using standard techniques as described by @xcite .",
    "the zeropoint of @xmath12 was calibrated with the polarized standard star bd+59389 @xcite . for the unpolarized standard star hd 14069 we found @xmath17 across the entire optical spectrum .",
    "figure 1 displays the total flux spectrum of the ot from all exposures combined .",
    "numerous metal absorption lines are superposed on a featureless continuum , as is typical for grb afterglow spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two distinct absorption systems are present in the spectrum ( table 2 ) .",
    "the individual absorption lines in the higher - redshift system have a mean @xmath18 .",
    "the second system has weaker absorption lines and a mean redshift of 1.223 .",
    "both systems show lines of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , as well as several lines including @xmath24 .",

    "one emission line is also present in the spectrum , centered at 8404.0   and consistent with [ ] @xmath2 at @xmath25 .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath1 system is the likely host of the grb , since it is the highest - redshift absorption system detected and its [ ] emission line is an indicator of star - forming activity .",
    "ionization of the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) by the grb could cause temporal variations in the equivalent widths of interstellar absorption lines within the host galaxy @xcite , and we have measured the equivalent widths of the absorption lines in the hour 1 , 2 , and 3 spectra separately to search for any variations .",
    "the differences in equivalent widths are consistent with the level of measurement uncertainty , and we conclude that no variability is detected .",
    "searches for ultraviolet absorption - line variability in other grbs have so far yielded null results as well @xcite .",
    "the continuum has a power - law slope of @xmath26 ( for @xmath27 ) on the red side . on the blue side",
    ", we find a steeper slope of @xmath28 .",
    "this apparent steepening toward the blue is affected by atmospheric dispersion and is sensitive to the centering of the ot within the slit , as well as reddening , so the red - side value is a more reliable measurement of the intrinsic slope . @xcite",
    "reported a shallower optical slope of @xmath29 approximately 98 hours after the burst .",
    "polarization was measured over five wavelength bins : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34  .",
    "all measurements were performed using the @xmath9 and @xmath10 spectra and their associated error spectra , with the results converted to @xmath11 and @xmath12 as the final step .",
    "we observed the same three polarized standard stars ( bd+59389 , hd 19820 , and hd 155528 ) during both nights of our observing run ( august 12 and 13 ut ) .",
    "for all three stars and five wavelength bins , the rms difference in the polarization measured from the two nights observations is only 0.04% .",
    "the polarized standard stars also have essentially constant @xmath12 as a function of wavelength ( to within @xmath35 ) , and agreement to within 1  between the two nights of observations .",
    "this demonstrates the excellent stability of the instrument .",
    "the raw measurements for the ot yield @xmath36 with @xmath37 , but a portion of this polarization is caused by transmission through regions of aligned dust grains in the galactic ism .",
    "the line of sight to grb 020813 has a galactic reddening of @xmath38 mag @xcite .",
    "along most galactic lines of sight , the maximum interstellar polarization observed is 9% per magnitude of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the isp probe star has @xmath40 at @xmath41 over 58006800  , falling comfortably within the expected range , and its @xmath42 spectrum is consistent with a serkowski interstellar polarization curve . to correct the polarization measurements of the ot , we fitted a low - order polynomial to the @xmath9 and @xmath10 spectra of the isp star and subtracted the result from the stokes parameters of the ot .",
    "the isp - corrected measurements for the ot are listed in table 1 ; random uncertainties due to photon statistics and detector read noise are at the level of 0.1% in @xmath11 and @xmath43 in @xmath12 .",
    "the standard star observations suggest that any additional systematic uncertainties should not be time - variable , and are likely to be @xmath44 in @xmath11 and @xmath45 in @xmath12 .",
    "the isp - corrected polarization longward of 5600   is nearly constant during the 3 hours at 1.92.2% . on the blue side",
    ", however , the polarization drops from @xmath46 during hour 1 to @xmath47 in hour 3 .",
    "this is formally a @xmath48 detection of polarization variability , but it is somewhat surprising to find significant variations in @xmath11 only on the blue side . as a check on this measurement , the reductions were repeated with different extraction and background windows , and repeated again using entirely different reduction software ; in all cases the results were consistent with the original measurements to within 0.1% in @xmath11 .",
    "we conclude that the variability in @xmath11 on the blue side is likely to be genuine , although we caution against over - interpretation of this result since the measurement is not repeatable .",
    "imaging polarimetry obtained on the following night at the vlt by @xcite demonstrates a much more dramatic level of variability in @xmath11 over the next 14 hours .",
    "covino et al .",
    "find a raw polarization of @xmath49 at @xmath50 , and isp - corrected values of @xmath51 at @xmath52.-band isp correction is @xmath53 at @xmath54 , in reasonable agreement with the polarization we measure for hd 187330 .",
    "] if we apply our isp correction to their raw measurement we obtain @xmath55 at @xmath56 . the change in @xmath11 between our hour 3 data and",
    "the vlt observation is significant at the @xmath57 level .",
    "this large drop in @xmath11 demonstrates that most of the polarization we detect in the keck data must be intrinsic to the ot itself , and not merely the result of transmission through dust within the host galaxy or the intervening galaxy at @xmath0 .",
    "the isp - corrected polarization detected by @xcite is sufficiently low that in principle it could arise from the interstellar medium in the host galaxy or perhaps even in the intervening @xmath58 system , although dust grains have a low polarization efficiency in the ultraviolet @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if grbs result from the death of massive stars , one can expect many grbs to occur in dusty and gas - rich star - forming regions , and in extreme cases type ii supernovae can have optical isp of several percent from the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , _",
    "observations have indicated a low absorbing column of @xmath59 @xmath60  that is consistent with the expected galactic absorption along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "also , the lack of any large change in @xmath12 accompanying the variation in @xmath11 suggests an intrinsic origin for the majority of the detected polarization .",
    "detection of a continued late - time decline in @xmath11 would provide a definitive test .",
    "our observations , combined with those of @xcite , clearly show variability in the degree of polarization , with a nearly constant position angle .",
    "this already places strong constraints on the polarization models .",
    "random effects , such as emission from a small number of randomly oriented magnetic field cells @xcite or amplification of the emission from one such cell by microlensing @xcite , would predict that @xmath11 and @xmath12 should change on the same timescale .    in principle , the jet geometry , together with an assumption of some level of orientation of the amplified magnetic field with respect to the shock , could predict the degree of polarization as function of time .",
    "models based on this scenario @xcite show that the maximum degree of polarization occurs around the time of the jet break ( @xmath61 ) , when the opening angle of the jet is equal to the inverse lorentz factor .",
    "however , at that time the emission is observable from a significant fraction of the jet .",
    "this introduces order - unity uncertainties in the polarization predictions since the energy distribution profile as function of distance from the axis of the jet is unknown .",
    "in addition , a detailed description of the hydrodynamic evolution is not yet available ; only the asymptotic scalings , well before and well after @xmath61 , are understood .",
    "thus , it is not possible to make detailed , quantitative comparisons of polarization models with observations .    despite these uncertainties",
    ", we can make general comparisons of the observations with the model proposed by @xcite , which predicts sharp features in the polarization light curves , although more realistic assumptions on the hydrodynamics of jet spreading , and on the energy distribution within the initial jet , are expected to produce smoother features than those predicted by this model .",
    "this model has three parameters .",
    "the line - of - sight offset to the jet determines the shape of the curve ; @xmath61  sets the overall timescale ; and an overall scale factor for @xmath11 is set by a function of the ratio of the magnetic field components parallel to and perpendicular to the shock front , which is assumed to be constant .",
    "we denote the offset in units of the opening angle of the jet by @xmath62 .",
    "( for @xmath63 the jet is not visible initially , corresponding to an `` orphan '' afterglow . )",
    "small offsets give rise to a single polarization peak , while large offsets yield three peaks , where the middle one has position angle perpendicular to the other two .",
    "more realistic jet models may smooth the curve and eliminate this middle peak .",
    "we note that the model of @xcite predicts only two peaks since their calculations did not include the spreading of the jet .",
    "figure [ model ] demonstrates that the jet model parameters can be chosen so as to find at least a qualitative agreement with the data . in the figure ,",
    "our measurements for the 58006800   polarization , and the @xmath64-band measurement from @xcite , are compared with two sample models . initial analysis of the optical light curve suggested @xmath65 hours @xcite , although subsequent analysis ( to be presented elsewhere ) indicates that the light curves may be consistent with a later value of @xmath66 hours .",
    "given this uncertainty in deriving @xmath61  from the photometric data , our approach is to determine whether there are any values of @xmath61  that produce polarization light curves consistent with the observations .",
    "the first model has a small offset @xmath67 and predicts one peak of polarization .",
    "( models with @xmath68 would give similar results . )",
    "this requires @xmath61  to occur during the keck observations , at @xmath69 hours .",
    "however , this model somewhat underpredicts the decay of polarization between our measurements and those of covino et al .",
    "a better fit is obtained for a medium - offset model with @xmath70 and @xmath71 hours , where the polarization drops to zero , or perhaps even rotates the position angle by 90 , between the keck and vlt observations . under both interpretations ,",
    "the overall level of polarization is less than the maximal possible level of @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that the magnetic field perpendicular to the shock differs only by @xmath72% from that parallel to the shock front .",
    "models with other values of @xmath73 have difficulty matching both the near - constancy of @xmath11 during the keck observations ( for @xmath74  ) and the large change in @xmath11 detected by @xcite .",
    "the polarization behavior of grb 020813 appears rather similar to that of grb 990712 , which varied between @xmath75 at 0.4 days after the burst and 1.2% at @xmath76 days , at nearly constant position angle @xcite .",
    "we note that our models with @xmath67 or @xmath77 could also be nearly consistent with the grb 990712 data within its uncertainties .",
    "still , as noted by rol et al . , the lack of clear evidence for a jet break for that event casts some doubt on this interpretation .",
    "finally , we mention that the hints of wavelength dependence to the polarization of grb 020813 , which appear to be time - variable , can not be accommodated by these models .",
    "a spectral break passing through the optical band at the time of our three measurements could produce such a signature , but there is no evidence for such a break .    to date ,",
    "polarimetric observations of grb afterglows have had rather sparse temporal coverage .",
    "further progress will require continuous polarization monitoring of bright afterglows , initiated as early as possible and extending well beyond @xmath61 .",
    "also , our data highlight the need for color information in future polarization measurements .",
    "obtaining such observations would pose some logistical difficulties , but the potential for improved understanding of the physical structure of the synchrotron jets from grbs would make this effort extremely worthwhile .",
