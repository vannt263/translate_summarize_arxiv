    "dz  cru ( also known as nova cru 2003 and the `` peculiar variable '' dz cru ) was discovered in 2003 august @xcite .",
    "it was initially reported as a nova but spectroscopic observations gave rise to doubts about its nova status , and comparisons were drawn with the unusual variable v838  mon @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented 12.5  infrared ( ir ) spectra obtained @xmath0  years after discovery .",
    "they found h , o and [ n ] emission lines superimposed on a hot dust continuum and concluded that dz  cru was indeed a classical nova at distance @xmath1  kpc ( although this is subject to considerable uncertainty ) .    here",
    "we present observations of dz  cru with the _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite , that reveal a hot dust shell with unusual emission features .",
    "dz  cru was observed with the infrarred spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on _ spitzer _ in staring mode on three occasions , as detailed in table  [ obs ] .",
    "spectra were obtained with both low- and high - resolution modes , covering the spectral range of 538 , and the blue peak - up array was used to centre the object in the irs slits . for the high - resolution modes we also obtained observations of the background .",
    "the spectrum was extracted from the version 12.3 processed pipeline data product using spice version 2.2 @xcite .",
    "we discuss primarily the low - resolution data in this paper , and use the high - resolution data ( which will be presented in detail elsewhere ) to determine expansion velocities ; the gas - phase features will also be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ dzcru_dust ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ( 5.0,6 . ) ( 0.0,4.0 )    there are superficial similarities between the dust shell of dz  cru and those of v2361  cyg ( helton et al .",
    ", 2010 , in preparation ) and v2362  cyg ( * ? ? ?",
    "* helton et al . , 2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "the latter displayed features at 6.37 , 8.05 , 11.32 , and a broad `` plateau '' centred at @xmath2 ; @xcite were unable to securely identify any of the dust features in v2362  cyg .",
    "we use the dusty fit ( see section  [ s_temp ] and fig .  [ dzcru_dust ] ) as a baseline to extract the dust features that are clearly present in dz  cru . the result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ features ] , in which the features are indicated by vertical ticks .",
    "the wavelengths and fwhm of the features are given in table  [ features_id ] , together with an indication of their presence ( possibly at slightly different wavelengths ) or absence in v705  cas @xcite and v2362  cyg @xcite , and in evolved stars .",
    "in addition there may be a `` plateau '' of emission that extends from @xmath3  to @xmath4  ( cf .",
    "fig .  [ features ] ) , although the shape of this depends of course on the shape of the fitted dusty spectrum longward of 14 . as is evident from fig .",
    "[ dzcru_dust ] , these features are present on all three dates of observation , but we note that the 8.2  feature in dz  cru appeared to weaken in the 2008 february spectrum , only to recover somewhat by 2008 april .",
    "the features listed in table  [ features_id ] are significantly broader than the [ o ] and [ ne ] lines ( @xmath5 , compared with @xmath6  for the ionic lines ) , so it is unlikely that the features in table  [ features_id ] are ionic lines , or even blends .",
    "we note that neither the 9.7  nor the 18  silicate features are present in the dust emission ; furthermore , there is no evidence for the more structured 9.7  feature sometimes seen in cometary silicates @xcite .",
    "we are therefore confident in ruling out silicates as a major dust component in dz  cru .",
    "also , it seems unlikely that any of the features in table  [ features_id ] can be associated with silicon carbide , which displays a number of features in the 912.5  range , depending on the nature of the sic @xcite .",
    "no set of features for the materials studied by @xcite match those listed in table  [ features_id ] .",
    "despite the absence of the expected 11.25  feature ( but see below ) , some of the features in dz  cru may plausibly be identified with `` unidentified infrared '' ( uir ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) features , which are seen in classical novae with optically thick dust shells @xcite .",
    "dz  cru is the fourth dusty nova in which the `` 8.2- '' feature has been prominent ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* helton et al . , 2010 , in preparation ) . in the case of v705  cas",
    ", @xcite identified the prominent feature at 8.2  ( cf .",
    "fig .  [ features ] ) as the uir feature normally seen at 7.7  ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite classified the uir features according to the strength of features in the 3and 613  regions ; novae seemed to occupy a unique category , with a 3.4  feature that is strong relative to that at 3.28 .",
    "further classification of the uir features has been carried out by @xcite and from the point of view of this paper , the classification of interest is their class  c. objects in this class show no 7.7  feature but instead a feature at 8.2 ; moreover they also display a weak 6.4feature , and an extremely weak 11.25  feature .",
    "these characteristics are very reminiscent of those seen in dz  cru ( cf .",
    "table  [ features ] ) , and it is tempting to suggest that the uir features in dz  cru place it in @xcite s uir class  c.    the two objects in @xcite s survey in their class  c are iras134166243 and crl2688 ( the `` egg '' nebula ) , both of which are post - agb stars , the latter undergoing rapid evolution from the agb to the planetary nebula phase @xcite . an object with a similar suite of uir features is hd100764 , a first - ascent red giant with a dusty disc @xcite .",
    "the central star of crl2688 has spectral classification f5iae ( effective temperature @xmath7  k ) , while that of hd100764 is an early carbon star with @xmath8  k ; the @xmath9 of iras134166243 is 5440  k @xcite .",
    "other objects displaying similar uir features have effective temperatures of this order @xcite .",
    "investigation of uir features in evolved and herbig ae / be stars @xcite strongly indicate that the wavelength of the `` 7.7 '' feature is highly environment - dependent , with a clear dependence of wavelength on the effective temperature of the exciting star @xcite . in stars having _ lower _ effective temperatures ( e.g. , as evidenced by direct spectroscopy , or by lack of circumstellar ionization )",
    "the `` 7.7 '' feature has a systematically _ longer _ wavelength ; for example the `` 7.7 '' feature only appears at 7.7  for @xmath10  k. @xcite and @xcite attribute this to photo - processing of the uir carrier by the stellar radiation field , and the consequent shift from aliphatic to aromatic bonds in the uir carrier , which in novae is most likely a form of hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ; we note that , while @xcite attribute the carrier to pah molecules , this is not the case in classical novae @xcite ) .",
    "if dz  cru is a classical nova , its effective temperature @xmath11  years post - eruption would be well in excess of the values for agb stars ( cf .",
    "the estimated @xmath12  k for v705  cas in * ? ? ?",
    "there is ample evidence ( e.g. from high excitation emission lines ) for a strong ultraviolet radiation field in all four novae displaying the `` 8.2 '' feature .",
    "dz  cru , and the other novae in which the `` 8.2 '' feature have been present , seem to defy the trend followed by other uir - bearing objects .",
    "furthermore , the uir feature that normally appears at 11.25appeared at 11.4  in v705  cas @xcite , which is also apparently contrary to the trend of increasing wavelength with decreasing @xmath9 for the `` 11.25 '' feature @xcite .",
    "the fact that the uir features in dz  cru and other novae are more akin to those in objects with a weak radiation field and late spectral type suggest that the distinctiveness of uir features in novae is unconnected with the radiation environment .",
    "a likely explanation is that the uir carrier in dz  cru has only recently been exposed to the hard radiation field of the stellar remnant , possibly because it has been protected within dense clumps .",
    "such clumps are required in nova winds to enable the chemistry that leads to nucleation @xcite , so that the ( hydrocarbon ) dust they contain remains unaffected by the hard radiation field ; there is certainly evidence for continued clumpiness in the ( optical ) remnants of the dusty novae fh  ser and rr  pic decades after eruption @xcite .",
    "the uir carrier in dz  cru may therefore have only recently been exposed to the ultraviolet radiation field of the nova , thus limiting the photo - processing it has experienced .",
    "we have described the dust shell of the classical nova dz  cru , which shows several broad emission features . a number of these features remain unidentified . however",
    "the `` 8.2 '' feature in dz  cru and other novae may be associated with a uir carrier in which aliphatic bonds predominate , likely as a consequence of the continued presence of dense clumps in the ejecta which shield the carrier from the hard radiation field of the nova .",
    "we anticipate that , as the ejecta ( and clumps ) disperse , a shift from aliphatic to aromatic may occur , accompanied by the shift of the uir features to the blue ; however it is more likely that the carrier will not survive exposure to the radiation .",
    "there are also implications for features in the 3-band , and it is unfortunate that spectra in this crucial region do not appear to have been obtained in the case of dz  cru",
    ".    continued ir spectroscopy of dz  cru in the 3  and 713  regions would be valuable to observe the effects of dispersal on the uir ( and other ) features .",
    "we thank the referee , greg sloan , for his thorough reading of an earlier version of this paper , and for his constructive comments ."
