    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are spherical , bound swarms of stars containing from @xmath0 to @xmath1 stars . near their centers the star density is normally over @xmath2 ( and in some cases @xmath3 ! ) per cubic parsec .",
    "they orbit the centers of most galaxies through the universe , about 200 orbit our milky way ( @xcite ) . of these ,",
    "28 clusters contain a total of 144 known radio pulsars .",
    "the gc pulsar population differs from the galactic disk population in two main ways :    1 .",
    "it is _ much _ older than the galactic population .",
    "this is to be expected given the great age of the stellar population in gcs .",
    "this population is so old that , with a few important exceptions ( discussed below ) , only recycled pulsars , which have lifetimes of many gyr , are still detectable as radio pulsars .",
    "it is a very _ abundant _ population . per unit",
    "mass there appear to be two to three orders of magnitude more pulsars in gcs as in the galactic disk .",
    "this also applies to x - ray sources , the progenitors of msps .",
    "the reasons for this latter fact , and its many consequences , are discussed in detail below .",
    "in the early 1970 s , the uhuru and oso-7 x - ray satellites revealed the presence of several x - ray sources in gcs ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the co - authors ( h. gursky ) recognized in 1973 that , compared to the stellar mass in the galaxy , this represented a large overabundance of x - ray sources . in 1975",
    "g. clark suggested that , given the extremely high stellar densities in the cores of some gcs , it occasionally happens that many old , dead nss lurking in the core  collide \" with a binary , disrupt it and acquire a ( new ) companion .",
    "the latter then evolves , fills its roche lobe and starts transferring matter to the ns , forming a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "an important question already considered in these early studies is the origin of all these lurking nss . in the early 1970 s some pulsar proper motions",
    "had already been measured ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and these already hinted at the fact that many nss form with kick velocities of hundreds of km per second .",
    "this has since been confirmed by many subsequent studies , with ever - increasing samples and better quality measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "such objects would not be retained in gcs , which have escape velocities of a few tens of kms@xmath4  unless they are anchored by massive companions ( @xcite ) .",
    "even with such anchoring , there seems to be a large excess of nss ( @xcite ) , which lead to a suggestion , still valid ( originally by @xcite ) that nss in gcs are forming through a low - velocity channel .",
    "this is now thought ( @xcite ) to be accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of massive oxygen - neon - magnesium wds that become unstable once they approach the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "this results in electron capture sne ( @xcite ) , not type 1a sne  there is not enough carbon available to power thermonuclear deflagrations .",
    "we will come back to this issue later .",
    "soon after the discovery of the first msp , b1937 + 21 in 1982 ( @xcite ) , it was suggested that msps are the end stages of the evolution of lmxbs ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that , unlike in the case of normal pulsars , most msps are found in binary systems . here",
    "the mystery is why some of these objects ( including b1937 + 21 itself ) are found to be isolated ; there is no satisfactory answer to this question yet .",
    "furthermore , msps have magnetic fields much smaller than those generally found in the normal pulsar population ; which means that accretion somehow  buries \" the magnetic field .",
    "this process is not well understood .",
    "if msps really evolve from lmxbs , then gcs , with their lmxb over - abundance , should also contain many msps .",
    "finding them was difficult , given the great distances to gcs . nevertheless , if a bright radio source is discovered in a gc , then it is likely a pulsar . in 1985 ,",
    "twelve nearby gcs were imaged with the very large array ( vla , @xcite ) , with one likely candidate in m28 , b1821@xmath524 .",
    "two years later , using the jodrell bank 75-m radio telescope , the discovery of radio pulsations at a period of 3.05 ms and dm of 120 @xmath6pc confirmed it as the first pulsar in a gc ( @xcite ) . in the following year , psr  b1620@xmath526 is discovered in the globular cluster m4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this pulsar , with a spin period of 11 ms , is in a 191-day orbit with a white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "interestingly , this binary system appears to be orbited by a jovian - type planet in a very wide orbit ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsars in gcs are faint owing to their great distances .",
    "this means that we are limited first and foremost by the sensitivity of the radio telescope and receiver used for the survey .",
    "this can be , to some extent , compensated by the fact that the pulsars are located in a small region around the cluster center ( owing to the effects of mass segregation , see e.g , @xcite ) which normally fits very well inside a single radio beam of even the largest radio telescopes .",
    "this allows for deep , multi - hour search observations , which can still be made sensitive to binary pulsars using acceleration search techniques ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is the reason why for most of the last 20 years we knew more msps in clusters than in the galactic disk .",
    "the early leader in pulsar discoveries was 47  tucanae ( @xcite ) , which now has a total of 23 known pulsars , all of them with spin periods shorter than 7.6 ms .",
    "of these , 15 are in binary systems , at least five of them eclipsing .",
    "the timing of these pulsars ( @xcite ) allowed x - ray detections of _ all _ of the msps ( @xcite ) , a study of the dynamics of the cluster ( @xcite ) and the first detection of any sort of interstellar medium in a globular cluster , after more than 60 years of searches ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , radio maps of a large group of gcs ( @xcite ) suggested that the heavily obscured gc terzan  5 had a large pulsar population , but of these only two were known before that study ( @xcite ) .",
    "sensitive observations at 2 ghz with the gbt have since discovered 32 pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "these include terzan  5  ad ( @xcite ) : with a spin frequency of 716 hz ; this broke the 24-year old record set by the original msp , b1937 + 21 .",
    "it is thought that @xmath7 pulsars remain to be discovered in terzan  5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "using the same observing system 8 new pulsars were found in ngc  6440 and ngc  6441 ( @xcite ) and 11 new pulsars in m28 alone !",
    "freire et al .",
    "( 2008a ) found that , for any particular luminosity threshold , there are nearly as many pulsars in ngc  6440 and ngc  6441 as there are in terzan 5 .",
    "the latter appears to be exceptional because of its smaller distance to the solar system ( 5.5 kpc ) , as opposed to 8.2 kpc for ngc  6440 and 13.5 kpc for ngc  6441 .",
    "this results highlights the fact that these surveys are strongly limited by sensitivity .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that , after correcting for distance , some gcs have many more pulsars than the average .",
    "although we do nt know all the factors involved in producing a large pulsar population , the stellar encounter rate has some predictive power not only in estimating the number of msps , but of other types of objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) , particularly x - ray binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsar populations of some clusters [ ngc 7078 ( @xcite ) , ngc 6624 ( @xcite ) , ngc  6517 ( @xcite ) and ngc 6752 ( @xcite ) ] are dominated by isolated pulsars , while others [ like 47  tuc ( @xcite ) , m62 ( @xcite ) , m3 , m5 and m13 ( @xcite ) ] are dominated by binaries .",
    "the distinguishing characteristic appears to be the core density ; most of the gcs where there are more isolated pulsars appear to be core collapsed .",
    "the high stellar density at the core might be disrupting previously formed binary msps .",
    "another possible disrupter are central black hole binaries , as has been suggested in the case of ngc  6752 ( @xcite ) .    furthermore , many of the gcs dominated by isolated pulsars appear to have a slower pulsar population ( @xcite ) , even in surveys where such clusters are observed with uniform sensitivity to fast - spinning pulsars , as in the comparison of m3/m5/m13 with m15 ( @xcite ) or ngc 6440/6441 with terzan  5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is likely that the high stellar densities of some gc cores are also disrupting x - ray binaries , leaving behind partially recycled pulsars .      some pulsars in gcs [ psr  b1718@xmath519 in ngc  6342 ( @xcite ) , psr  b1820@xmath530b ( @xcite ) and j1823@xmath53021c ( @xcite ) in ngc  6624 and b1745@xmath520 in ngc  6440 ( @xcite ) ] have characteristics very similar to the normal pulsars found in the galactic disk : periods of the order of a few tenths of a second , magnetic fields of the order of 10@xmath8 g and characteristic ages of a few times @xmath9  yr - about @xmath2 times younger than the stellar population in gcs .",
    "clearly these pulsars can not have formed in recent iron core collapse sne  there have not been any since the first few tens of myr of the histories of these clusters .",
    "the partial recycling described above could be spinning up old , dead nss just enough to make them active radio pulsars , but without going on for long enough to bury their magnetic fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative hypothesis , also discussed in lyne et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is ongoing formation of new nss through e - capture sne .",
    "if this hypothesis is correct , then the sne must have small kicks , otherwise , the formation rates required by the observed population would be unrealistic ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first pulsar in an eccentric binary discovered in a gc was psr  b2127 + 11c ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is very similar to the original binary pulsar , b1913 + 16 ( @xcite ) , so it does not indicate anything special is happening in gcs .",
    "the discovery of psr  b1802@xmath507 , in the gc ngc  6539 ( @xcite ) revealed a type of system unknown in the galactic disk : a relatively fast - spinning pulsar ( @xmath10ms ) with a low - mass ( @xmath11 ) companion an an eccentric ( @xmath12 ) orbit .",
    "all similar systems then known in the galaxy had very low ( @xmath13 ) eccentricities .",
    "this indicated severe orbital perturbations by passing stars ( @xcite ) , something to be expected given the high stellar densities in the cores of gcs .",
    "the discovery of psr  j0514@xmath54002a , in ngc  1851 , an msp with a spin period of 4.99 ms , a very eccentric ( @xmath14 ) 18.8-day orbit ( @xcite ) and massive companion indicates very conclusively that the pulsar exchanged companions after being recycled : the companion is too massive ( @xmath15 , @xcite ) for its progenitor to have recycled the pulsar to its current spin period .",
    "this is also the case for at least another system , psr  j1807@xmath52500b , in ngc  6544 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , this sort of system bears witness to the very same process that lead to the recycling of so many pulsars in gcs .",
    "their dense environments can produce binary pulsars ( and binary systems in general ) that are truly unlike anything that binary stellar evolution can produce in the galactic disk .",
    "these are the systems we designate here as  exotic \" .",
    "a total of 19 eccentric ( @xmath16 ) systems have been discovered in gcs ( e.g.  @xcite ) , including 7 such systems in terzan 5 alone ( @xcite ) .",
    "the eccentricities allow at least the measurement of the rate of advance of periastron .",
    "when this effect is due to the effects of general relativity alone it yields an estimate of the total mass of the binary ( @xcite ) .",
    "when more post - keplerian measurements become available , we can measure individual masses precisely and in some cases test general relativity ( @xcite ) .      until recently , it appeared that one of the distinctive characteristics of the pulsar population in gcs was the large number of eclipsing binaries : 21 known at present . until 2009 ,",
    "only two were known in the galactic disk , the original  black widow \" system , psr  b1957 + 20 ( @xcite ) and psr  j2051@xmath50827 ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , several of the eclipsing systems discovered in gcs [ e.g. , psr  b1718@xmath519 in ngc  6342 ( @xcite ) , psr  j1748@xmath52446a , p and ad in terzan 5 ( @xcite ) , j0024@xmath57204w in 47  tuc ( @xcite ) , j1740@xmath55340 in ngc  6397 ( @xcite ) , j1701@xmath53006b in m62 ( @xcite ) and psr  j2140@xmath52310a in m30 ( @xcite ) ] had in some cases very extensive eclipses and non - degenerate companions with a few tenths of a solar mass . because these systems ( nicknamed  redbacks \" by mallory roberts ) had no counterpart in the galaxy , they were thought to be  exotic \" , i.e. , results of exchange interactions where a radio pulsar acquires a new main - sequence companion .",
    "however , it was suggested that , due to its similarity with sax  j1808.4@xmath53658 ( the first accreting msp , @xcite ) , 47  tuc  w might also represent a transitional object ( @xcite ) , not an exotic system .",
    "the building of the lmxb - msp bridge continued with the discovery of psr  j1023 + 0038 ( @xcite ) , the first galactic  redback \" , which showed these objects are not restricted to gcs .",
    "the number of eclipsing systems in the galaxy has since increased dramatically , in great part due to the launch of the fermi satellite .",
    "the tale is told by mallory roberts in these proceedings .",
    "the  black widow \" and  redback \" systems are much more abundant in the galactic disk than previously thought . despite this , some eclipsing systems in gcs are likely to be truly  exotic \" , like psr  b1718@xmath519 ( @xcite ) .      in gcs , there are two msps that appear to have unusually high magnetic fields , very large spin - down energies and ages smaller than 30 myr  about 0.3 % of the age of the clusters that host them .",
    "one of them is the first gc pulsar , psr  b1821@xmath524 .",
    "soon after its period derivative ( @xmath17 ) was measured ( @xcite ) , the unusual nature of the msp was noticed and discussed .",
    "it was deemed to be unlikely that a contribution from the cluster acceleration could be the cause for the anomalous @xmath17 .",
    "there is firmer evidence of this for the second  super - energetic \" msp to be discovered , psr  b1820@xmath530a in ngc  6624 ( @xcite ) .",
    "initially the discoverers suggested that the very high @xmath17 was due to acceleration in the cluster ; this is a possibility given that the cluster has a collapsed core and the pulsar is ( at least in projection ) very close to the center .",
    "however , the high @xmath18-ray luminosity of this object ( @xcite ) implies that this pulsar has to be energetic and quite young .",
    "these msps have lifetimes @xmath19 times shorter than the more normal msps and are about @xmath20 times less abundant ; therefore both types must be forming at comparable rates .",
    "we list three main possibilities for their formation process : ( a ) these pulsars were members of now disrupted x - ray binaries , where spin - up went much further than for the young , slow pulsars , but where the  burial \" of the magnetic field was not concluded .",
    "this would nicely explain why both objects are single , ( b ) these pulsars could result from aic or merger - induced collapse of wds ( @xcite ) , ( c ) they might have an identical formation channel to other msps ( @xcite ) . if ( a ) is correct , then these super - energetic msps are  exotic \" ,",
    "i.e. , only found in gcs .",
    "otherwise we should see similar systems in the galaxy , likely associated with gamma - ray sources . as the present generation of high - resolution 20-cm surveys probes deeper into the galaxy for msps ( @xcite ) we might soon know whether pulsars like psr  b1820@xmath530a and b1821@xmath524a exist outside gcs or not . finding them would have grand implications",
    ": it would mean that they are forming at rates similar to normal msps through the universe and that msps are born with a range of magnetic fields wider than currently believed ; the observation that the majority of msps have very low b - fields would then be a selection effect caused by low b - field msps being much longer lived .",
    "if e - capture sne are forming nss in gcs , they should also be forming nss in the galaxy : nothing about them is exclusive to gcs .",
    "a low - velocity ns population has indeed been suggested several times from proper motion data of radio pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but this signature is not clear and could be due instead to projection effects ( @xcite ) . this might be explained if e - capture sne result only from aic of a massive o - ne - mg wd ( or , alternatively , from the merger of two wds ) , i.e. , if it requires evolution in a binary system ( @xcite ) . if this is true , then binary systems are the place to look for evidence of nss formed in e - capture sne in the galaxy .    the binaries seem to agree .",
    "pfahl et al .",
    "( 2002 ) identified a class of high - mass , long orbital period ( @xmath2130 days ) low - eccentricity x - ray binaries ( the prime example being x  per/4u 0352 + 309 ) , in which the nss must have been born with a low kick velocity . later , remarking the low eccentricities of several double neutron star systems , van den heuvel ( 2004 ) suggested that the second - born nss in those systems were produced by e - capture sne .",
    "an additional piece of evidence in these systems is the ns mass measurements , some of them as low as 1.25  m@xmath22 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as expected from the gravitational collapse of a contracting o - ne - mg core that is just beyond its chandrasekhar mass ( 1.38  m@xmath22 , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there is also some evidence for systems where the first formed ns has a very low mass and low velocity , ( psr  j1802@xmath52124 ; @xcite ) , or a very small vertical velocity and possibly a small ns mass ( psr  j1949 + 3106 ; @xcite ) , however the massive wd progenitors should have diminished post - sn velocities of these binaries .",
    "another case is psr  j1903 + 0327 ( @xcite ) , the first msp discovered in the alfa pulsar survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "this anomalous pulsar was likely formed in a triple system ( @xcite ) , but the preservation of the triple requires a very small kick velocity ( @xcite ) ; this is consistent with the very small peculiar velocity of this system ( @xcite ) .",
    "systems where the first ns formed in e - capture sne should constitute a dynamically separate ns population in the galaxy with very low scale height ; furthermore many of the nss should have distinctively low masses .",
    "proper motion measurements of the many msps being discovered in the current high - resolution 20 cm surveys should be able to determine whether such a population exists and determine its size .",
