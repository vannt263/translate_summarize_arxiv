    "a characteristic feature of high energy collisions is the multiparticle production .",
    "it is generally understood as following from a primary hard interaction ( here @xmath5 ) with subsequent evolution of a parton cascade according to the rules of perturbative qcd from the initial scale @xmath6 down to a low energy scale @xmath7 where colour confinement leads to the formation of hadrons .",
    "the parton evolution is dominated by gluon bremsstrahlung with its collinear and soft singularities which causes the jet structure of the partonic final state also characteristic of the final state of hadrons .",
    "the transition into hadrons is described by non - perturbative models . in a particularly simple ansatz for hadronization",
    "one assumes that observables for the multiparticle final state are proportional to the corresponding quantities for partons , an idea which has been proposed originally for single inclusive energy spectra and is called `` local parton hadron duality '' ( lphd ) .",
    "subsequently , this idea has been applied to a rather wide range of phenomena from inclusive multiparticle correlations to quasi - exclusive processes ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "the agreement with data generally increases with the accuracy of the calculations .    here",
    "we report on a recent application @xcite of these duality ideas to the moments of multiplicity distributions which correspond to integrals over multiparticle correlation functions .",
    "experimental results on these quantities have been presented by the l3 collaboration @xcite .",
    "we consider here the unnormalized and normalized factorial moments @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath10 with multiplicity distribution @xmath11 and mean multiplicity @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , one introduces the cumulant moments @xmath13 and @xmath14 which are used to measure the genuine correlations without uncorrelated background in a multiparticle sample @xmath15 in particular @xmath16 ; for a poisson distribution @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "of special interest are the ratios @xmath19 as there is a prediction for high energies of an oscillatory behaviour @xcite with the first minimum near @xmath20 at lep energies .",
    "such a minimum has been observed indeed in @xmath0 annihilations at slc @xcite and at lep @xcite but the magnitudes of moments are found much smaller than predicted @xcite .",
    "predictions in @xcite are obtained by solving numerically the evolution equations for the moments which are derived from the evolution equations of the single jet generating function ( review @xcite ) together with the initial condition at threshold at fixed transverse momentum cut - off @xmath21 .",
    "this cut - off characterizes at the same time the hadronization scale @xmath22 in the description of the hadronic final state and also the jet resolution ( parameter @xmath23 at jet energy @xmath24 ) for the jet final state obtained with a jet algorithm based on a transverse momentum cut - off ( `` durham algorithm '' ) .",
    "different approximations are considered .    in the double logarithmic approximation ( dla )",
    "one takes into account the most singular bremsstrahlung singularities .",
    "this corresponds to the asymptotic solution and some results can be given in analytic form , for example , @xmath25 .",
    "these asymptotic results are quickly approached above threshold energy @xmath26 where there is only one particle in the jet .",
    "then , @xmath27 for @xmath18 and @xmath14 oscillates @xmath28 and consequently also @xmath1 does .    the modified logarithmic approximation ( mlla )",
    "takes into account certain non - leading logarithmic terms and gives a more realistic description at finite energies . in fig .",
    "[ hqmlla - nf ] the energy dependence of the parton multiplicity ( cut - off @xmath7 for hadrons ) is seen above the multiplicity for jets at the same ratio @xmath29 because the transverse momentum is in the argument of the coupling constant @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "contrary to the dla the threshold for higher moments @xmath9 is shifted towards higher energies .",
    "remarkably , there is a poissonian transition point with @xmath32 for all moments .",
    "below this point the @xmath1 ratios show rapid oscillations as in ( [ kmom0 ] ) whereas above there is a transition to oscillations of length increasing with energy .",
    "finally , a comparison of data is performed with a monte carlo calculation of the parton cascade where we use ariadne - d as in @xcite but with refit parameters @xmath7 and @xmath33 to simulate the hadronic final state directly . here",
    "energy momentum conservation is fully taken into account as well as the @xmath34 matrix element for @xmath35 .",
    "the results are similar to those from the mlla evolution equation .",
    "in particular , the data on jet and hadron multiplicities with the splitting as in fig .",
    "[ hqmlla - nf ] are rather well described and also the variation of the oscillation pattern of @xmath1 with jet resolution @xmath36 , see fig .",
