    "the isolation of single layer graphene by novoselov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has initiated intense and diverse research on this system .",
    "graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms tightly packed into a two - dimensional honey - comb lattice , has drawn attention of scientists in various disciplines due to its unconventional and fascinating electronic properties arising particularly from the linear dispersion relation around the dirac points of the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "these unique properties can be understood in terms of the dirac hamiltonian  @xcite since it actually describes the physics of electrons near the fermi level of the undoped material .",
    "the carriers in graphene effectively behave as massless relativistic particles within a low energy range close to fermi energy and these massless dirac fermions  @xcite evince various phenomena in this energy range .",
    "the bipartite character of the wonderful lattice structure of graphene strongly influences its intrinsic properties and makes graphene a wonderful testbed not only for condensed matter theory , but also for quantum field theory and mathematical physics . though lot of studies have been done both theoretically as well as experimentally to reveal electronic properties of this exotic system , yet complete knowledge about it is still lacking .",
    "this motivates us to address some interesting issues of electron transport in carbon nanotubes where a nanotube is formed by rolling up a graphite ribbon in the cylindrical form  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we explore the behavior of persistent current in a finite sized graphite nanotube with zigzag edges within a nearest - neighbor tight - binding ( tb ) framework using a generalized hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of persistent current in a mesoscopic ring , threaded by an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) flux @xmath0 , has been studied theoretically more than two decades ago  @xcite .",
    "later it has been justified through several nice experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is a pure quantum mechanical effect and can persist without any dissipation in the equilibrium case . in the last few years extensive studies on persistent current in carbon nanotubes",
    "have been performed and many interesting physical phenomena have been explored  @xcite .",
    "persistent current in a carbon nanotube is highly sensitive to its radius , chirality , deformation , etc .",
    "very recently it has also been observed experimentally that the fermi energy of a carbon nanotube can be regulated nicely by means of electron or hole doping , which can induce a dramatic change in persistent current  @xcite . it is well established that in a conventional multi - channel mesoscopic cylinder electron transport",
    "strongly depends on the correlation among different channels as well as the shape of    fermi surface .",
    "therefore we might expect some interesting features of persistent current in a carbon nanotube due to its unique electronic structure .",
    "the behavior of persistent current in zigzag nanotubes has been addressed theoretically by some groups  @xcite .",
    "there are many theoretical techniques available in the literature  @xcite which generally investigate magnetic response of the entire system but the distribution of persistent current among different branches of the nanotube remains unaddressed though it is highly important to illuminate the magnetic response of the system with a deeper insight . to the best of our knowledge , no rigorous effort has been made so far to unravel the behavior of persistent current in separate branches of a graphite nanotube .",
    "this is the main motivation behind this work .    in what follows , we present the results .",
    "section ii is devoted to present the model and generalized hf approach .",
    "following the energy spectra for the non - interacting and interacting cases ( section iii ) , in section iv we establish the second quantized form to evaluate persistent current in individual branches of a zigzag carbon nanotube .",
    "the energy - flux characteristics are described in section v , while the behavior of persistent current in separate branches of a nanotube is illustrated in section vi .",

    "we roll up the graphite ribbon along @xmath3 direction using periodic boundary condition and allow to pass a magnetic flux @xmath0 ( measured in unit of elementary flux quantum @xmath5 ) along the axis of the tube as shown in fig .  [ tube ] .",
    "we describe our model quantum system by the nearest - neighbor tb framework which captures most of the essential properties of the tube nicely  @xcite . in presence of magnetic flux",

[ ham ] ) for a particular filling , in the mean field scheme , into two non - interacting hamiltonians ( for up and down spin electrons ) and then diagonalize the hamiltonian for up ( down ) spin electrons . for identical filling factor of up and down spin electrons",
    "the energy levels are exactly similar both for @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( see fig .  [ energy](b ) ) , and therefore , one energy spectrum can not be separated from the other . since in our case we set @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we get total @xmath90 independent energy levels and due to their overlaps individual energy levels are not clearly distinguished from the spectra given in fig .  [ energy ] . to have a better look in fig .",

    "multiples of @xmath91 , energy levels have either a maximum or a minimum ( see fig .",
    "[ spectra2 ] ) , and accordingly , at these points persistent current becomes zero which is quite obvious since the current is obtained by taking the first order derivative of the eigenenergy with respect to flux @xmath0 ( eq .  [ deri ] ) .",
    "both the energy spectra take a complicated look as there are many crossings among the energy levels particularly in the regions away from @xmath51 ( fig .",

    "the energy levels become almost flat for a wide range of @xmath0 , and , near @xmath93 they vary slowly with @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra2](a ) . these almost flat energy levels support a very    little contribution to the persistent current as clearly followed from eq .",
    "[ deri ] . while , the other energy levels with larger slopes provide large persistent current .",
    "this peculiar nature of the energy levels invokes the _ current amplitude to become filling dependent _ and we elaborate it in the following section . in fig .",

    "[ energy](b ) are also re - plotted in fig .",
    "[ spectra2](b ) for better viewing .",
    "the electronic correlation leads to an energy gap at the band centre and the gap increases with @xmath19 .",
    "it is illustrated in fig .",
    "this energy gap is consistent with the energy gap obtained in the @xmath48-@xmath49 diagram ( fig .  [ uband](b ) ) .",
    "the variation of ground state energy level of a carbon nanotube with zigzag edges as a function of magnetic flux @xmath0 is depicted in    fig .",

    "the energy levels evince one flux - quantum periodicity , as expected , and their energies get increase with @xmath19 .",
    "it can be explained as follows . in presence of @xmath19 ,",
    "each site is occupied by an electron with either up or down spin in the half - filled band case .",
    "this is the ground state energy configuration .",
    "now , if we add an electron further , the probability of getting two opposite spin electron in a single site becomes finite which gives higher energy due to the repulsion in presence of @xmath19 .",
    "now we focus our attention on the behavior of persistent current in a zigzag nanotube .",
    "first , we illustrate the dependence of persistent current amplitude on the electron filling . to ensure it in fig .  [ filling ] we present the current - flux characteristics of a zigzag nanotube considering @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where four different figures correspond to the four different cases of electron filling .",
    "the hubbard interaction strength is set at @xmath96 .",
    "it is observed that when the number of electrons is much smaller than half - filling , persistent current exhibits multiple kinks at different values of @xmath0 , associated with the multiple crossings of energy levels , as shown in figs .",

    "the number of electrons are @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "this is quite analogous to the nature of persistent current observed in conventional multi - channel mesoscopic cylinders .",

    "[ filling](d ) . here",
    "we choose @xmath103 i.e. , the nanotube is very near to the half - filled band case . in such a case",
    "all the kinks disappear and current varies almost continuously , analogous to the behavior of persistent current observed in traditional single - channel mesoscopic rings . for the cases when the nanotube is far away from half - filling , current amplitudes are quite comparable to each other ( see figs .  [ filling](a)-(c ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when the tube is nearly half - filled current amplitude remarkably gets suppressed .",

    "[ filling](d ) .",
    "this enormous reduction of current amplitude can be visualized from the @xmath48-@xmath0 characteristics given in fig .",
    "[ energy ] . at half - filling or very close to half - filling , the top most filled energy level lies in the nearly flat region i.e. , around @xmath51 ( see fig .  [ energy](a ) ) and it contributes a little to the current .",
    "moreover , when @xmath104 , there is gap in the midband region .",
    "now , for a particular filling the net persistent current is obtained by taking the sum of individual contributions from the lowest filled energy levels , and , in this process only the contribution which comes from the highest occupied energy level survives finally and the rest disappear due to their mutual cancellations .",
    "it leads to the enormous reduction of persistent current amplitude in the half - filled or nearly half - filled case .",
    "this feature is independent of the size of the nanotube .",
    "in all these cases , persistent current varies periodically with flux @xmath0 , exhibiting @xmath91 flux - quantum periodicity . from these current - flux spectra",
    "we can emphasize that , the current amplitude in a zigzag nanotube is highly sensitive to the electron filling and this phenomenon can be utilized _ in designing a high conducting to a low conducting switching operation and vice versa .",

    "the hubbard correlation strength @xmath19 is set equal to @xmath107 . in each of these figures we display currents carried by both up and down spin electrons together .",
    "they are exactly superposed with each other .",

    "@xmath114 , the current in the middle channel , becomes the isolated one since we have chosen @xmath86 .",
    "this is true for any zigzag nanotube with odd @xmath2 . for a tube with even @xmath2 , currents are pairwise identical . summing up the individual currents in seven zigzag channels",
    "we get net persistent current carried by up and down spin electrons in the nanotube which is presented in fig .  [ udistribution](h ) and the total current is displayed in fig .",
    "[ udistribution](i ) which exactly matches with the total current derived from the conventional method where first order derivative of the ground state energy is taken into account , as shown in fig .",
