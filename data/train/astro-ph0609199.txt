    "cataclysmic variables @xcite are interacting close binary stars in which a white dwarf is accreting from a companion . in the vast majority of cases",
    "the companion is a low - mass main - sequence star or red dwarf and the periods are measured in hours .",
    "the red dwarf is transferring hydrogen - rich material to the white dwarf by roche lobe overflow at a rate , @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "as the hydrogen settles on the surface , the base of the layer becomes degenerate and heats .",
    "when enough , @xmath2 to @xmath3 , has accumulated it ignites .",
    "the degenerate conditions lead to a thermonuclear runaway and a nova explosion .",
    "the system brightens by ten or so magnitudes and most of the layer if not all of it together with some of the underlying white dwarf material is blown off .",
    "though some of this material may fall back on to the white dwarf and some of it may be accreted back by the red dwarf , a significant fraction escapes carrying with it only the intrinsic angular momentum of the white dwarf .",
    "the system expands such that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the separation and @xmath6 the total mass which has just decreased .",
    "if the red dwarf had no atmosphere , that is a distinct boundary just filling its roche lobe , it would no longer do so and mass transfer would cease .",
    "this is the idea of hibernation first documented by @xcite . at that time",
    "they were motivated by the apparent lack of cataclysmic variables in the solar neighbourhood when compared with theoretical estimates and the frequency of classical novae in m31 .",
    "the complete detachment during hibernation would render the majority of cataclysmic variables unobservable at any given time .    because the red dwarf has a slightly extended atmosphere it actually must overfill its roche lobe in order to maintain an equilibrium mass - transfer rate .",
    "the ratio of the atmosphere scale height to the radius of the star is comparable to the ratio of the mass lost from the system to its total mass , so the change in separation is not sufficient to shut off mass transfer altogether but does reduce the rate significantly .",
    "this change in rate could be responsible for the diversity of cataclysmic variable types at a given period : dwarf novae that undergo disc instability outbursts require a lower mean mass - transfer rate than nova - likes that do not suffer the disc instability @xcite .",
    "however the idea lost favour when it was realised that the nova ejecta would temporarily form a common envelope around the system and consequential angular momentum loss would actually cause lower - period systems to shrink @xcite .",
    "recent work by @xcite indicated that the common - envelope phase is very poorly understood and that in some cases systems with tenuous envelopes can actually expand . since we wish to compare the simplest case we neglect any common - envelope phase in this work .",
    "a detailed analysis of the period distribution was made by @xcite .",
    "he emphasized that the lack of dwarf novae between 3 and  @xmath7hr is difficult to reproduce theoretically with any reasonable magnetic braking law .",
    "he speculated that the solution might lie in a better understanding of any of additional angular momentum loss alongside mass transfer , weak but unnoticed magnetic fields that disrupt the inner parts of the disc , correlation between white dwarf mass and orbital period or hibernation . among these he deduced that hibernation might prove the most promising and it is this that we explore here in more detail .",
    "we investigate the hibernation scenario for cataclysmic variable diversity in the light of two recent changes to the accepted model of cataclysmic variables .",
    "these are    1 .   the relation between the mass of hydrogen that must be accreted to ignite @xmath8 and the secular accretion rate @xcite 2 .",
    "the possibility that magnetic braking , that drives the evolution of cataclysmic variables , could be much weaker than previously thought @xcite .",
    "we consider hibernation in its simplest form to deduce what combinations of @xmath9 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 , the mass actually ejected in the nova , could be consistent with the observed variety of cataclysmic variable types .",
    "we first consider a simple analytical model to get some idea of what fraction of the time is spent in hibernation and then consider the simplest numerical model that includes the pertinent effects of the atmosphere and variations of @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "the cataclysmic binaries we consider consist of a white dwarf , of mass @xmath11 , and a low - mass main - sequence star , of mass @xmath12 and radius @xmath13 .",
    "the hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium radius of the main - sequence star can be approximated by , @xmath14    the roche lobe radius @xmath15 is the radius of a sphere which encloses the same volume as that enclosed by the last stable equipotential surface around star  @xmath16 .",
    "the roche lobe radius of star  2 , for a restricted range of mass ratio @xmath17 , is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total mass of the system @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of this formula makes it useful for analytic work within the restricted but useful range of @xmath20 . when @xmath21 mass is transferred from the red dwarf to the white dwarf .",
    "kepler s third law , that relates the angular velocity @xmath22 of each star and the binary system to the total mass @xmath6 and the separation of the two stars @xmath5 , is @xmath23 when the red dwarf is filling its roche lobe , @xmath24 , we combine equations  ( 1 ) ,  ( 2 ) and  ( 3 ) to find @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the orbital period .",
    "so in this model the orbital period depends only on the mass of the main - sequence star when @xmath24 .",
    "we assume the spin angular momentum of the stars is negligible compared to the orbital angular momentum .",
    "hence the total angular momentum of the system is @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the distances from star  1 and star  2 respectively to the centre of mass of the system .",
    "we can rearrange @xmath30 to find @xmath31 and similarly for @xmath29 .",
    "substituting into equation  ( 5 ) we have @xmath32 using kepler s law , equation  ( 3 ) , and equation  ( 8) we can rearrange to get the separation @xmath33 and the angular velocity @xmath34 in terms of the three independent variables , @xmath35 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "when a critical mass @xmath36 , which we examine later , has accumulated on the surface of the white dwarf star , thermonuclear reactions ignite in the degenerate material .",
    "suppose the entire layer of @xmath36 is expelled from the system in a nova explosion . since @xmath37 , the angular momentum of the system changes by @xmath38 we want to find an expression for the change in separation during the nova eruption .",
    "equations ( 8) and ( 11 ) give @xmath39 differentiating equation  ( 8) gives @xmath40 but , because @xmath12 is constant during the eruption , @xmath41 .",
    "differentiating equation  ( 3 ) we get , @xmath42    we can combine equations  ( 12 ) ,  ( 13 ) and  ( 14 ) to get the familiar result @xmath43 because of the mass loss from the system , the separation of the stars increases during the explosion .",
    "equations  ( 12 ) and  ( 15 ) ensure that @xmath44 during the eruption .",
    "the roche lobe radius must also increase as the separation increases .",
    "differentiating equation  ( 2 ) and substituting equation  ( 15 ) we find @xmath45 after the eruption @xmath46 and so the mass - transfer rate decreases sharply , switches off in this model . in this low mass - transfer rate",
    "the cataclysmic binary is said to be in a state of hibernation .",
    "we now consider a fully conservative case for which @xmath47 and @xmath48 so @xmath49 since @xmath50 we can substitute to find @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath17 .",
    "these two equations show that , as the mass of the red dwarf decreases , @xmath5 and @xmath53 only decrease if @xmath54 .",
    "but because the roche lobe continues to shrink as @xmath20 decreases , mass transfer does nt end at @xmath55 .",
    "differentiating equation  ( 3 ) we get @xmath56 and combining with equation  ( 18 ) we find @xmath57 this shows that the minimum roche lobe radius is when @xmath58 .",
    "but for most observed cataclysmic binaries @xmath59 and steady mass transfer occurs . for a red dwarf to be in steady contact with its roche lobe there must be something causing loss of orbital angular momentum .    so after an eruption the stars gradually get closer together because of the loss of angular momentum which brings the main - sequence star back into contact with its roche lobe .",
    "the mass - transfer rate increases once more and the cycle is repeated .",
    "we have many eruptions .",
    "we want to find the range of mass ratios @xmath20 for which mass transfer is stable .",
    "since we have , by differentiating equation  ( 1 ) @xmath60 and in order to be stable we need @xmath61 by comparing equations  ( 21 ) ,  ( 22 ) and  ( 23 ) we therefore must have @xmath62      after a nova eruption the main - sequence star no longer fills its roche lobe because the orbit has expanded .",
    "here we assume that the rate of angular momentum loss @xmath63 remains constant until the next nova explosion .",
    "when the system is detached ( when there is no mass transfer ) @xmath64 .",
    "so from one nova explosion , the time until mass transfer begins again is the time it takes until @xmath65 shrinks back to @xmath13 . from equations  ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) and  ( 16 ) , @xmath66 so the time the system spends detached is , @xmath67    when the system is semi - detached mass is transferred from the red dwarf to the white dwarf , @xmath50 and @xmath68 . the roche lobe of the red dwarf is filled so that @xmath24 and @xmath69 so @xmath70 rearranging this we find @xmath71 substituting  ( 28 ) into  ( 13 ) we get @xmath72 the time spent semi - detached is @xmath73 this model predicts the ratio of time spent detached to the time spent semi - detached to be , @xmath74 we plot it in fig .",
    "[ tstdq ] for later comparison with our numerical model and note that this is consistent with the result of @xcite that hibernation should be deepest when @xmath20 is close to one .",
    "* classical novae * are a class of novae and cataclysmic variables that have had only a single observed eruption .",
    "their brightness ranges from  6 to greater than  19 magnitudes . *",
    "dwarf novae * ( dne ) are a class of cataclysmic variables that have had several observed outbursts .",
    "these outbursts however range in brightness from 2 to  5 magnitudes .",
    "they are associated with a disc instability .",
    "* nova - like systems * ( nls ) include all non - outbursting cataclysmic variables .",
    "their spectra indicate that they could be novae in a pre- or post - eruption stage .",
    "the nature of the cataclysmic variable , dn or nl , should depend only on the mass - transfer rate which itself should only depend on the system masses and period .",
    "however at any given period some of each type are seen .",
    "we now estimate the radius and luminosity of the main - sequence star with the formulae of @xcite and use the more accurate formula for the roche lobe radius for star @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the mass ratio @xmath77 .",
    "this formula is valid for all @xmath20 .      by considering cold white dwarf models",
    "@xcite calculated the critical pressure at the base of the hydrogen rich layer for ignition . based on this @xcite",
    "derived @xmath78 where the prime distinguishes this from a prescription that includes the effect of varying the mass - transfer rate .",
    "however the white dwarf is heated by accretion so the rate also depends on @xmath79 .",
    "@xcite have calculated the critical mass which causes ignition on the white dwarf .",
    "we make a linear fit to their figure  8 and find @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 when @xmath8 has accumulated on the white dwarf we have a nova explosion .",
    "we consider three different models , two in which the mass ejected is constant in all the explosions ,    1 .",
    "@xmath83 2 .",
    "@xmath84    and one in which the mass ejected in the nova equals the amount of mass needed for ignition ,    1 .",
    "@xmath85 .      when the main - sequence star is overfilling its roche lobe mass is transferred on to the white dwarf so that @xmath86 we approximate the atmosphere of the red dwarf by a simple isothermal model .",
    "the rate of mass loss from the red dwarf is then given by , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the amount by which the star overfills its roche lobe , @xmath89 when the red dwarf underfills its roche lobe , @xmath46 , @xmath90 is negative and the mass - transfer rate is very small . when the star overfills its roche lobe , @xmath21 , @xmath91 and the mass transfer rate increases .",
    "the scale height @xmath92 of the unperturbed isothermal atmosphere of the main - sequence star is @xmath93 so we need to find @xmath94 , the density at position @xmath95 .",
    "the equations of an isothermal atmosphere are @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the pressure , @xmath98 is the gas constant , @xmath99 is the effective temperature at the surface of the main - sequence star and @xmath100 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "the atmosphere is a mixture of hydrogen , helium and metals in various states of ionization and in molecules .",
    "so we use @xmath100 equal to @xmath101 . the gravitational field strength at the surface of the red dwarf is , @xmath102 the surface temperature of the main - sequence star is found by stefan s law , @xmath103 integrating the equations in  ( [ des ] ) for @xmath104 , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is some constant .",
    "hence we find the scale height , @xmath107 the factor in front of the exponential in equation  ( 38 ) is an estimated maximum mass - transfer rate equal to the mass of the secondary star divided by its dynamical timescale . we have verified that varying it by large factors has almost no effect on our results because @xmath90 simply adjusts to compensate when mass transfer is stable .",
    "angular momentum is continually lost from the system . for the closest systems gravitational radiation",
    "is the most important cause of mass transfer .",
    "the rate of loss of angular momentum in gravitational radiation from two point masses in a circular orbit is @xcite @xmath108    in wider systems however magnetic braking is the more important mechanism .",
    "the rate of change of angular momentum owing to magnetic braking is uncertain .",
    "based on the work of @xcite , @xcite postulated a rate of the form    @xmath109    however recent work by @xcite based on the spins of stars in clusters suggests that this rate is orders of magnitude too high .",
    "but such a low rate would not be able to drive the interrupted magnetic braking model for the period gap between two and three hours in cataclysmic variables . in this model",
    "a system evolves to lower period as @xmath12 drops at such a high rate that the red dwarf is out of thermal equilibrium . at a period of three hours , a mass of about @xmath110",
    ", magnetic braking abruptly falls off , perhaps because the red dwarf has become fully convective .",
    "the mass - transfer rate drops and the red dwarf shrinks back to its equilibrium radius and must wait for some much weaker angular momentum loss mechanism to shrink the orbit until @xmath65 is again reduced to @xmath13 . with the high rate",
    "the period gap is very well reproduced . with the low rate",
    "the stars are not far enough from thermal equilibrium and , even if magnetic braking were interrupted , the gap would be much too narrow .",
    "if such a low rate proves to be correct an alternative reason for the period gap must be found .",
    "the nova decay time is @xmath111 to @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "so although irradiation of the red dwarf from the white dwarf may increase the mass - transfer rate initially , it will only be for a small fraction of the inter nova period of several thousand years . though we find increased mass transfer while the white dwarf is hot the time for which it is is negligible and we ignore it .",
    "we note that the irradiation cycles discussed by @xcite operate on a much longer timescale and would have to survive several episodes of hibernation .",
    "we select the systems from ritter s catalogue @xcite which are classified as nova - likes or as dwarf novae and divide them into period bins with at least five systems of each kind in each bin .",
    "we then divide these numbers to find the observed ratio of nls to dne .",
    "though there are obvious selection effects , such as the fact that dwarf novae , owing to their variability , are far more easily spotted , we can hope to reproduce trends in this ratio .",
    "[ obs ] shows that the ratio peaks at a period of just over @xmath113hr then decays as the period increases further . after a period of @xmath114",
    "there are very few observed binaries but the data do suggest that the ratio increases again slightly with increasing period .",
    "we use the period of the peak ratio @xmath115 and the fact that it has dropped by a factor of twelve by @xmath116 to test our models .",
    "we do not expect to reproduce the exact height of the peak because different selection effects apply to dne and nls .",
    "we exclude identified polars and intermediate polars but we can not be certain that others , particularly ips , do not contaminate the sample of nls .",
    "however their contribution is small , certainly when compared with other probable selection effects , at the relatively high periods we consider here .",

    "[ mdot ] shows an example of the mass - loss rate of the red dwarf for three nova explosions .",
    "= 8.4 cm    there is a critical mass - transfer rate above and below which the system appears to be in two different states .",
    "this critical rate of mass loss from the main - sequence star is @xmath119 @xcite , where @xmath120 .",
    "dwarf novae lie below the critical value .",
    "they have @xmath121 whereas nova - likes all lie above the critical @xmath122 relationship .",
    "just after a nova explosion , the mass - loss rate from the red dwarf is very small .",
    "the time from the explosion until the mass - loss rate has increased up to the critical rate is @xmath117 .",
    "the binary then appears to be a nova - like from this time until the next eruption , @xmath118 .",
    "we calculate the ratio of these times .",
    "@xmath123    if the critical mass - transfer rate is higher than the rate of the model for the whole cycle , then we are predicting that there are no nova - likes , only dwarf novae .",
    "so we have @xmath124 @xmath125 time between nova eruptions .",
    "similarly , if the critical rate is lower than the mass - transfer rate , we have only nova - likes , @xmath126 and @xmath127 time between nova eruptions .    in fig .",
    "[ tstdq ] we compare this ratio for @xmath128hr against @xmath20 with the simple analytic calculation in section 2.4 . at a period of @xmath113hr",
    "there are both nls and dne at approximately all mass ratios and we see that both models are indeed very similar .      in order to compare our models with the observed data we need to plot the predicted ratio against the period but the ratio also depends on @xmath20 . for a given period ,",
    "we average the ratio over varying @xmath20 . averaging by adding the total times , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , over a flat @xmath20 distribution and then finding the ratio of these total times is our preferred method .",
    "it automatically takes account of system lifetimes .",
    "the longer the time , the more weight it is given in the averaging . in the observed data , the longer a system is in a state , the more likely it is to be observed .",
    "we do not try to model the birth rate of various systems with population synthesis because we consider this to be too uncertain .",
    "we therefore implicitly assume all cataclysmic variables equally likely to form .",
    "to examine the effects of a much lower angular momentum loss rate we multiply the formula for magnetic braking ( equation 47 ) by a constant factor .",
    "we try combinations of different @xmath131 factors and @xmath10 and compare the ratios in table  @xmath101 .",
    ".models with different factor in @xmath9 and @xmath10 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table  1 we list various models and properties which can be compared with the observations . as we have discussed , selection effects make any truly quantitative comparison difficult but we have identified key features in fig .",
    "[ obs ] that ought to be reproduced .",
    "we also concentrate on periods above the gap because we are interested in what can be said about magnetic braking irrespective of whether or not it is interrupted .",
    "then we see a peak in the ratio of nls to dne just above @xmath132 with a rapid decrease to higher periods . by @xmath133",
    "it should have fallen by a factor of  12 .",
    "a record of ` inf ' for the peak ratio indicates no dwarf novae .    with the full @xcite braking rate ( @xmath9 factor = 1 ) we can not reproduce these features .",

    "if a constant @xmath136 mass is ejected then there is a peak in the ratio at @xmath137 .",
    "only when @xmath138 do we find a peak at about @xmath139 but then the ratio has hardly fallen by @xmath116 . in any case",
    "such a large ejected mass is unrealistic .",

    "they deduced that @xmath140 would be necessary to account for the observed spread in @xmath141 at a given period above @xmath113hr .",
    "it is not until we have reduced the braking rate by a factor of ten that we can reproduce the observed features .",
    "there is little variation between the three different @xmath10 , all of which show a peak in the ratio at about @xmath132 with a drop by a factor of five or more by @xmath116 .",

    "all of the mass - transfer rates are lower than the critical value and so we see only dwarf novae",
    ". the only way this could be consistent with observations would be if another mechanism such as irradiation or magnetic cycles can periodically raise the mass transfer by an order of magnitude .",
