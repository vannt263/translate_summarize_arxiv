    "translations similar to this process has been used earlier when dealing with multilayer problems .",
    "@xcite in lens optics , the focal condition is the upper - right element to be zero .",
    "we observe that equi - diagonalization obtained as above does not leave the upper - right element invariant .",
    "it is also already known to us that this is also not possible through rotations as we had presented in  @xcite .",

    "we were first interested in achieving the equi - diagonalization of the two - by - two matrix without changing the off - diagonal elements .",

    "since the inverse of the rotation matrix is also its hermitian conjugate , we can put both the scale transformation and the rotation into one set of hermitian trasformations .",
    "the @xmath0 matrices are essential in understanding the propagation of light , both in ray optics and gaussian beam optics .",
    "its determinant is one for lossless systems . for paraxial ray optics ,",
    "this two - by - two matrix has real components , and in view of the condition on its determinant the number of independent components reduces to three .",
    "therefore , from a group theoretical point of view , it can be represented in terms of the symplectic group @xmath33 , consisting of one rotation and two squeeze matrices , whose properties have been extensively discussed in connection with its applicability to optics .",
    "@xcite    it was noted in our earlier publications that this matrix can not always be diagonalized , but it can be brought to a form with equal diagonal elements .",
    "this equi - diagonal form can serve many useful computational purposes .",
    "we noted further that the @xmath0 matrix can be brought to an equi - diagonal form by a rotation . as was noted in sbsec .",
    "[ math ] , this rotation and the scale change in lens optics can be grouped into a set of hermitian transformations .",
