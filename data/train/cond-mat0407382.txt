    "recently , with the rapid progress in computing facilities , rather sophisticated numerical methods started to arise which attempt to determine quantitatively correct electronic band structures of solids from first principles .",
    "these methods can be grouped in two families : those focusing on ground - state properties such as the electron density ( or the quasi - particle green function ) and those trying to approach the full many - body electron wave function .    as a rule ,",
    "traditional density functional methods are used in solid state physics to study the electronic properties of infinite periodic systems , but since these approaches are not designed for excited states they usually strongly underestimate the band gaps of non - conducting systems . also these methods do in general not allow improvements in some controlled way .",
    "on the other hand , methods based on many - body wave functions of finite systems are well - established in quantum chemistry .",
    "they usually start from an approximate wave function ( e.g.  the hartree - fock ( hf ) wave function ) and approach the correct solution by improving the wave function systematically .",
    "the development of such methods for solids only started recently ( see below ) .",
    "the band gaps obtained on the hf level ( via koopmans theorem ) are usually far too large , but the situation improves steadily upon successive inclusion of correlation effects . in this sense",
    "the wave - function - based methods are more general though more demanding in predicting quantitatively correct electronic structures of periodic system than the common density functional methods",
    ".    among the recently developed wave - function - based approaches to correlated band structures one can distinguish those which employ local hamiltonian matrix elements in real space @xcite , those which work directly in @xmath0-space and use many - body perturbation theory to account for electron correlation @xcite , and those which use an approximate green function formalism @xcite . other approaches to electron correlation in solids @xcite are presently implemented , corroborating the currently high interest in this new and rapidly growing research field .",
    "the aim of this letter is to present the local hamiltonian method which originates from the approach to valence bands described in ref .",
    "@xcite but which can now also treat conduction bands and thus allows to predict _ complete _ band structures ( and in particular band gaps ) of non - conducting systems with controlled accuracy .",
    "the presented method is designed to be used with any suitable standard quantum - chemical program package .",
    "we decided for the multireference version of the single and double configuration interaction method ( mrci(sd ) ) to account for electron correlation in both the ground and excited states of the system together with a special size - consistency correction we have developed for that purpose @xcite .",
    "this explicitly includes up to five - particle configurations ( three holes and two electrons or vice versa ) and therefore goes far beyond any of the other wave - function - based methods mentioned above .    to achieve our goal , the original problem of determining delocalized electronic states with a crystal momentum ( bloch states )",
    "is reformulated in terms of localized orbitals in real space ( wannier functions ) . in this representation",
    "one can take advantage of the predominantly local character of correlation effects and evaluate them step - by - step in finite clusters of the periodic system .",
    "the approach is purely _",
    "ab initio_. we adopt the experimentally known geometry of our test system ( _ trans_-polyacetylene ) and we do not make any approximation for the electron - electron or electron - nuclear interaction .",
    "the valence band energies @xmath1 of a periodic system are defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ground - state energy of the neutral @xmath4-electron system and @xmath5 is the energy of that excited state @xmath6 of the ( @xmath4 - 1)-electron system which corresponds to a quasi - hole of spin @xmath7 , crystal momentum @xmath8 and valence band index @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding equation for the conduction band energies @xmath10 reads @xmath11 with @xmath12 labeling the conduction bands and @xmath13 referring to the excited - state of the ( @xmath4 + 1)-electron system which is associated with a quasi - particle of spin @xmath14 in a virtual bloch orbital @xmath15 . note , that the band energies are differences of _ total _ energies rather than simple one - particle energies . also note , that excited states which do not have any counter part in the single - orbital picture such as satellite and shake - up states are explicitly excluded here .    on the hartree - fock level the ground - state wave function of the neutral system",
    "is approximated by a single slater determinant @xmath16 , and because in infinite systems there is no orbital relaxation upon removal or adjunct of a single electron , koopmans theorem holds such that the excited states of the ( @xmath4@xmath171)-electron system are simply given by @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 create or annihilate an electron in the respective hf spin orbitals which can directly be obtained ( together with the hf band energies ) from standard hf program packages for periodic systems like crystal @xcite .    applying separate multi - band wannier transformations to the occupied and virtual bloch orbitals",
    "provides two sets of local wannier functions , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the lattice vector to the unit cell associated with each wannier function ( see fig .",
    "[ tpa ] ) . using these wannier functions so - called local one - particle configurations",
    "@xmath24 can be introduced , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 create or annihilate an electron from the respective wannier spin orbital .",
    "having switched to the local configurations the hartree - fock band energies can be recovered by diagonalizing the @xmath0-dependent ionization potential and electron affinity matrices , @xmath27 and @xmath28    the same holds for the _ correlated _ band energies provided the wannier transformations which mediates between the bloch and the wannier orbitals is applied to the excited - state wave functions as well , yielding @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the band - mixing matrices of the two wannier transformations .",
    "the _ correlated _ ionization potential and electron affinity matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined in perfect analogy to eqs .",
    "( [ ipn ] ) and ( [ eam ] ) .    the transformed many - body wave functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 are sometimes referred to as correlated local holes and correlated local electrons. yet , like the wannier functions or any other kind of localized orbitals they are pure mathematical constructions only meant to provide a convenient _ local _ representation of the delocalized eigenstates @xmath6 and @xmath36 one is looking for .",
    "the benefit of this local representation is two - fold .",
    "firstly , the off - diagonal ( or hopping ) matrix elements of @xmath37 and @xmath38 decay rapidly with increasing distance @xmath23 when well - localized wannier orbitals are used such that the ( in fact infinite ) summation over @xmath23 in eqs .",
    "( [ ipn ] ) and ( [ eam ] ) can be truncated at some distance @xmath39 .",
    "secondly , the individual local matrix elements @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be evaluated in _",
    "finite _ clusters of the periodic system , because excitations from the involved local spin orbitals into some distant spin orbitals become negligible once they are sufficiently apart .",
    "in addition , as outlines in ref .",
    "@xcite , asymptotic corrections can be applied to account for the missing contributions , if necessary .    to obtain the local matrix elements ( lmes ) from the clusters our local hamiltonian approach",
    "is applied to the finite cluster as well leading to a set of localized occupied and virtual orbitals @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the corresponding molecular ionization potential and electron affinity matrices @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    ". however , instead of determining the lmes in order to find the band energies as done for the periodic system , one now proceeds in the opposite direction . starting from the excited - state energies @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the cationic and anionic cluster , which can be calculated ( together with the molecular ground - state energy @xmath46 ) by means of any suitable quantum chemical correlation method ,",
    "the unknown lmes are evaluated according to @xmath47 the unitary matrices @xmath48 and @xmath49 stem from some suitable localization such as the foster - boys procedure @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ tpa ] ) and are the molecular counter parts of the band - mixing matrices .",
    "we used the mrci(sd ) option @xcite of the molpro program package @xcite taking the unrelaxed hartree - fock orbitals of the neutral system to expand the wave functions of the charged molecules as well .",
    "the lack of size - consistency ( sc ) inherent to truncated ci schemes could be overcome by developing a special sc correction for the ( @xmath4@xmath171)-electron systems @xcite similar to the well - established pople correction @xcite for closed - shell systems . to facilitate the",
    "still quite demanding cluster calculations the incremental scheme was employed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    despite the formal hole - particle dualism in the equations above",
    ", there is quite a difference between valence and conduction band calculations for _ ab initio _ hamiltonians .",
    "virtual orbitals are much harder to localize than occupied ones and the anionic clusters tend to become electronically unstable such that some embedding or confinement techniques have to be applied to make the calculations feasible .",
    "as test system for our method we chose a _",
    "trans_-polyacetylene single chain , an infinite , flat hydro - carbon molecule with alternating c  c bond lengths and c@xmath50h@xmath50 as repeat unit ( see fig .",
    "[ tpa ] ) .",
    "the experimental geometry of the carbon skeleton @xcite , @xmath51(c  c ) = 1.45 and @xmath51(c = c ) = 1.36 with a lattice constant of 2.455 , is adopted resulting in a bond angle @xmath52(c  c , c = c ) of 121.74@xmath53 , and the c  h bond length is 1.087 ( taken from ref .",
    "flexible correlation - consistent valence triple zeta ( vtz ) basis sets @xcite were used throughout , to allow reasonable correlation calculations also for the anionic ( @xmath4 + 1)-electron states .",
    "x - ray scattering tells @xcite that crystalline _ trans_-polyacetylene ( tpa ) consists of weakly coupled fishbone - like packed tpa single chains all aligned in the same direction , as is also evident from the high anisotropy of the electronic properties of bulk tpa . our hf calculations with crystal give valence band widths of 5 - 10 ev for crystal momenta @xmath54 parallel to the chains but not more than 0.4 ev in the perpendicular directions .",
    "the same holds for the low - lying conduction bands up to about 3 ev above the lowest conduction band energy .",
    "hence , up to this energy , bulk tpa can , in fact , be considered as a quasi one - dimensional crystal and a single tpa chain with the finite basis sets is an appropriate model for investigating that part of the electronic structure .",
    "the band structure of a single tpa chain as obtained by our local hamiltonian approach is depicted in fig .",
    "[ bands_fig ] where it is compared to the hf data . all five valence bands and the three lowest conduction bands of tpa are shown . evidently , the band structure changes dramatically upon inclusion of electron correlation .",
    "the valence bands shift upwards , the conduction bands downwards , and a flattening of all bands ( significantly more pronounced in the valence region ) is observed leading to the desired narrowing of the band gap .",
    "other interesting but more subtle changes are also discernible , e.g. the lifting of accidental degeneracies or the narrowing of avoided crossings .",
    "the band gap of tpa reduces by 2.31 ev from 6.42 ev on the hf level down to 4.11 ev when correlation is included .",
    "this value is perfect in line with similar values , 2.35 and 2.38 ev , reported in two independent studies on tpa single chains @xcite and @xcite , where the @xmath55 bands alone were investigated by means of mller - plesset perturbation theory ( mp2 ) .",
    "the lowest ionization potential becomes 4.58 ev , the highest electron affinity 0.47 ev , a positive value finally , indicating that _ trans_-polyacetylene is able to retain an extra electron as is known from experiment @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of our approach is governed by the error in the determination of the lmes by the incremental scheme . for tpa",
    "it mainly arises from the truncation of the incremental series after the second order corrections .",
    "the discarded long range polarization effects turned out to be negligible .",
    "the resulting uncertainty in the band structure could be estimated to not exceed 0.3 ev for any @xmath0-point which is less than 1% of the total band energy range .",
    "a more detailed error analysis can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the new size - consistency ( sc ) correction for the excited states is crucial here to reduce the sc error in the lme increments to 0.01% of the contributing correlation energies .",
    "the truncation error of the lattice summations in eqs .",
    "( [ ipn ] ) and ( [ eam ] ) was analyzed on the hf level . keeping only lmes above 1 mhartree ( which results in 59 lmes for the valence and 39 for the conduction bands )",
    "the band energies from a canonical hf calculation with crystal could be reproduced within 0.2 ev .",
    "these deviations can easily be accounted for by adding them to the band energies emerging from the lmes ( as done in fig .",
    "[ bands_fig ] ) .",
    "in optical studies on bulk _ trans_-polyacetylene @xcite an absorption maximum at about 2 ev is observed .",
    "taking into account the evidence , both experimentally and theoretically for the existence of an excitonic gap state @xcite , 0.4 ev below the conduction band @xcite , the fundamental band gap of tpa becomes 2.4 ev , which is noticeably smaller than the value of 4.1 ev we ( and others @xcite ) found .",
    "@xmath55-band splitting due to interchain coupling was made responsible for that discrepancy @xcite , but for the experimentally found fishbone - like stacking of bulk tpa we only find a reduction of the fundamental band gap of 0.6 ev on the hf level and suppose ( based on the mp2 data in ref .",
    "@xcite ) a further 0.2 ev reduction upon inclusion of correlation leading to a gap of 3.3 ev .",
    "the more pronounced reductions ( @xmath56 ev ) reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for two tpa chains are considered to be an artifact of the vertical tpa packing assumed there .",
    "the missing long - range _ interchain _ polarization existing in the bulk material could be the reason why wave - function - based methods applied to tpa single chains ( or stacks of a few of them ) consistently overestimate the fundamental band gap of tpa , but it could also be that effects beyond bare electron correlation have to be included to achieve accordance with experiment .",
    "nevertheless , this study demonstrates that our local hamiltonian approach provides a sought scheme to perform reliable wave - function - based correlation calculations for excited electron hole and attached - electron states in solids and polymers with any suitable quantum chemical correlation method available , as corroborated by similar studies in our group on diamond and hydrogen fluoride chains .",
