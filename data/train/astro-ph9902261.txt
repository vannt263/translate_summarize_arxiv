    "( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we further investigate the radio variability of 0235 + 164 , and attempt to determine the most likely physical mechanisms behind the observed flux density variations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and the data reduction ; subsequently we analyze the lightcurves and point out some of their special properties . in section 3",
    "we explore different scenarios which could explain the variability : we discuss relativistic shocks , a precessing beam model , free - free - absorption , interstellar scattering , and gravitational microlensing .",
    "finally , in section 4 we conclude with a summary of the failures and successes of these models .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume a cosmological interpretation of the redshift , we use @xmath6km/(smpc ) and @xmath7 , which gives for the redshift of 0235 + 164 a luminosity distance of 3280@xmath8mpc ; 1mas corresponds to 4.2@xmath8pc .",
    "the radio spectral index is defined by @xmath9 .",
    "from oct 2 to oct 23 , 1992 , we observed 0235 + 164 with a five - antenna subarray of the vla during and after a reconfiguration of the array from d to a. the aim of these observations was to search for short - timescale variations in several sources .",
    "the complete data set will be presented elsewhere ( kraus et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in parallel",
    ", optical observations were performed in the r - band ( see section [ optical ] ) . data for 0235 + 164 were taken at 1.49 , 4.86 , and 8.44ghz ( @xmath10  20 , 6 , 3.6 cm ) every two hours around transit , i.e. , six times per day .",
    "these three sets of receivers have the lowest system temperatures and highest aperture efficiencies of those available at the vla ( see crane & napier @xcite ) ; and data in these bands are less susceptible to problems with poor tropospheric phase stability than those at higher frequencies . in addition",
    ", intraday variability of compact flat - spectrum radio sources did appear most markedly in this frequency range in previous observations ( quirrenbach et al .",
    "@xcite ) . during the first week",
    ", the antennae included in our subarray were changed repeatedly due to the ongoing reconfiguration ; however , an attempt was made to maintain an approximately constant set of baselines . since 0235 + 164 and",
    "the used calibrator sources used are extremely compact ( cf .",
    "vla calibrator list ) , the effect of the ongoing reconfiguration on the measurements is negligible .    after correlation and elimination of erroneous data intervals ,",
    "we performed phase calibration first . subsequently , a ( one - day ) mean amplitude gain factor was derived using non - variable sources such as 1311 + 678 , which have been linked to an absolute flux density scale ( baars et al .",
    "1977 , ott et al .  1994 ) by frequent observations of 3c286 and 3c48 . after a second pass of editing spurious sections of the data , the visibilities of each scan",
    "were incoherently averaged over time , baselines , polarization , and ifs . because of the point - like structure of the sources , the mean source visibility is proportional to the flux density .",
    "eventually , systematic elevation and time - dependent effects in the lightcurves were removed , using polynomial corrections derived from observations of the calibrator sources 0836 + 710 and 1311 + 678 .",
    "the errors are composed of the statistical errors from the averaging and a contribution from the residual fluctuations of the non - variable sources 3c286 , 1311 + 678 and 0836 + 710 .",
    "the level of these fluctuations was estimated from a running standard deviation of the calibrator measurements over a two - day period . over the full three - week period ,",
    "the standard deviations were found to be 0.5 , 0.5 , and 0.7% of the mean value at 1.5 , 4.9 , and 8.4ghz respectively ( with no significant difference between the three non - variable sources ) .",
    "the resulting lightcurves for the three frequencies are displayed in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fg : mainplot ] .",
    "the mean flux densities are 1.57jy , 4.05jy , and 5.22jy for @xmath11ghz , respectively .",
    "therefore , 0235 + 164 had a highly inverted spectrum at the time of the observations with spectral indices @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the radio data were supplemented by observations at 650 nm ( r - band filters ) taken at the following telescopes : 0.7 m telescope , landessternwarte heidelberg , germany ; 1.2 m telescope , observatoire de haute provence , france ; 1.2 m telescope , calar alto , spain ; 2.1 m telescope , cananea , mexico .",
    "owing to limited observing time per source and weather limitations , the optical data are sampled more sparsely .",
    "they cover the first week of the radio observations , leave a gap for ten days , and continue for a total of thirty days , thus ending ten days after the radio monitoring .",
    "after the usual ccd reduction process ( see e.g.  heidt & wagner  1996 ) , we performed relative photometry referencing the measurements to three stars within the field . the corresponding lightcurve is plotted in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fg : mainplot ] .",
    "the measurement errors are smaller than the symbol size . in addition , we include three data points , taken from the long - term monitoring by schramm et al .",
    "those are marked by triangles .      as evident from fig .",
    "[ fg : mainplot ] , 0235 + 164 is variable in all three radio bands and in the optical .",
    "a major flare around jd  2448905 can be identified throughout the radio frequencies , and may be tentatively connected with the optical maximum at the beginning of the observation .",
    "we note , however , that the exact position of the latter can not be determined precisely due to the sparse sampling of the optical data .",
    "therefore , we consider the connection between radio and optical variations as possible , but not definitive .    in addition , a second flare towards the end is present in the 21cm - data , possibly corresponding to the increase at 6 cm , and the sharp peak by a factor of two in the optical . a corresponding feature at 3.6 cm would be expected well inside the observation period but is definitely not present .",
    "the lightcurve at 6 cm shows additional faster variations which have no corresponding features at the other wavelengths",
    ". these faster variations ( which are not shown by the calibrator sources and therefore are real ) could for example be caused by scattering in the ism as we will discuss later .",
    "but we note that the `` global '' behavior is very similar at all three radio wavelengths .",
    "we focus in this paper on the first flare ( jd @xmath14 2448910 ) which is pronounced in all three radio frequencies , and could be connected to the optical increase around jd  2448900 .",
    "we assume that all four observed lightcurves are caused by the same physical event in the source . in order to describe this major feature ,",
    "we fit a linear background and one gaussian component to the radio lightcurves ( using all data points before jd  2448910 ) according to @xmath15 where s(t ) is the measured flux density .",
    "the parameters and estimated errors are listed in table  [ gaussfit ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     therefore , the faster variations which are clearly seen at higher frequencies ( especially in the 6 cm lightcurve ) may be due to iss .",
    "another possible explanation for the origin of the observed variations is gravitational microlensing ( ml ) by stars in a foreground galaxy .",
    "ml effects have been unambiguously observed in the multiple qso 2237 + 0305 ( irwin et al .",
    "@xcite , houde & racine @xcite ) , and most likely also in other multiply - imaged qsos ( see wambsganss @xcite , and references therein ) . the possibility that ml can cause agn variability has long been predicted ( paczyski @xcite , kayser et al .",
    "@xcite , schneider & weiss @xcite ) , but it remains unclear whether ml causes a substantial fraction of the observed variability in qsos ( e.g.schneider @xcite ) .",
    "0235 + 164 has a foreground galaxy ( @xmath4 ) situated within two arcseconds from the line of sight ( spinrad & smith @xcite ) , and an additional galaxy 05 away from the source ( stickel et al .",
    "@xcite , see also additional components reported in yanny et al .",
    "@xcite ) . additionally , a nearby absorption system was observed at @xmath16 cm by wolfe , davis & briggs ( @xcite ) .",
    "all three objects may host microlenses affecting the emission from 0235 + 164 .",
    "thus , for 0235 + 164 the probability for ml is expected to be high ( narayan & schneider @xcite ) , so that sometimes ml events should be present in the lightcurves .",
    "we will show now how ml can modulate the underlying long - term lightcurve and explain faster variations of long - wavelength flux compared to short - wavelength radiation , even when the longer wavelength radiation comes from a larger source ( component ) . since the available data do not permit a detailed account of possible ml situations , the attention here",
    "is restricted to two simple situations : an isolated point - mass lens in the deflector , and a cusp singularity , formed by an ensemble of microlenses ( schneider & weiss @xcite , wambsganss @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , both cases yield similar predicted ml lightcurves",
    ". the scales of the source size and the lens mass necessary to yield a flux variation of the observed kind can be estimated for both cases together .",
    "we assume an elliptically shaped emitting feature that moves relativistically in the direction roughly coinciding with the minor axis of the ellipse .",
    "such a component can be formed by relativistic electrons which are locally accelerated by a shock front inside a superluminal jet .",
    "the shape of the source component and its orientation is then determined by the flow inside the jet .",
    "a gaussian brightness profile is assumed , with component size @xmath17 ( see fig .  [ fg : ml_geometry ] for details ) .",
    "we postulate that the emission peaks at all three wavelengths are displaced relative to each other , but that the peaks of shorter - wavelength components are situated within the half intensity contour of longer - wavelength components .",
    "let @xmath18 be the apparent effective transverse velocity of the source component ; using the redshift @xmath19 of the object , this corresponds to an angular velocity of @xmath20mas / day . if a source component moves along a track in the source plane , and the component size is much smaller than the minimum angular separation @xmath21 from the singularity , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fg : ml_geometry ] ( solid ellipse ) , then the timescale of variation is given roughly by the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "on the other hand , if a strongly elongated source component moves so that parts of it cross the line of sight to the singularity ( as indicated in fig .  [",
    "fg : ml_geometry ] , dashed ellipse ) , then the shortest possible timescale is roughly the ratio between the transverse angular source size @xmath23 ( the minor semi - axis at wavelength @xmath24 ) and the angular velocity .",
    "now assume that the former case approximates the 3.6 cm source and the latter case approximates the 20 cm source",
    ". if @xmath25days , @xmath26days and @xmath27days are the variability timescales for the three wavelengths considered , we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the axis ratio of the gaussian source component . in order for the 20 cm source to experience appreciable variations ,",
    "the closest separation of its center from the singularity can not be larger than its major semi - axis , i.e. , @xmath31 , and this inequality can be satisfied for @xmath32 .",
    "since the relative contribution of the moving component to the total flux of the source is unknown , we can not use the observed lightcurves to determine the magnification of the component emission .",
    "the magnification of a point source at separation @xmath33 from the point singularity is @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the angular scale induced by a point mass lens of mass @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 denote , respectively , the angular diameter distances to the lens , the source , and from the lens to the source , @xmath42 is the lens mass in units of the solar mass . assuming that the lens is situated at @xmath43 , @xmath44 approximating the point - source magnification by @xmath45 ( for @xmath46 ) , and assuming as before that the size @xmath47 is much smaller than the closest separation of the source from the point - like singularity , the maximum magnification of this source component becomes @xmath48 hence",
    ", a solar - mass star would yield a magnification of the order of 2 for the smallest source component moving at roughly the speed of light and in general can produce lightcurves similar to the observed variations .    in fig .",
    "[ fg : ml_lightcurves ] , we plot numerically determined ml lightcurves for a moving source with an axis ratio @xmath49 , minimum separation @xmath50mas , and semi - major axis of the 20 cm source component of @xmath51mas .",
    "the lens mass is @xmath52 .",
    "the source sizes are chosen to be proportional to wavelength , and the brightness peaks of the 6 cm and 20 cm components are displaced relative to the peak of the 3.6 cm component by 0.4 of their corresponding sizes . as can be seen from the modeled lightcurves ,",
    "the variability timescale of the 20 cm component is considerably shorter than that of the shorter wavelength components , in accordance with our analytical estimates .",
    "in addition , the observed shift of the brightness peak at 20 cm before those at smaller wavelengths can be accounted for in our model by a slight tilt of the direction of motion of the source relative to the minor axis of the surface brightness ellipses , in the sense of the large component crossing the caustic point before the closest approach of the 3.6 cm component to that point .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the small source sizes needed ( in the range of @xmath53as ) will result in brightness temperatures of the order of @xmath54k , i.e. , three orders of magnitude above the inverse compton limit .",
    "a more detailed modeling of the lightcurves by a microlensing scenario is not warranted at this stage , given the large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless , the above considerations have demonstrated that the basic qualitative features can be understood in the microlensing picture without very specific assumptions .",
    "we have observed the bllac object 0235 + 164 at three radio wavelengths and in the optical r - band and found rapid variations in all frequency bands .",
    "one single event that can be identified at all radio wavelengths shows very peculiar properties .",
    "the brightness peak is reached first at 20 cm wavelength , and afterwards at 3.6 and 6 cm .",
    "the amplitudes of the flares decrease from longer to shorter radio wavelengths , and the timescales become longer . the event in the radio regime",
    "might be connected to the bright peak in the optical lightcurve , although this connection remains questionable due to the sparse sampling of the r - band data . in the previous sections",
    ", we have discussed some models and to what extent they can explain the observed variations .    while the conventional application of the shock - in - jet model has difficulties in reproducing the observations , the assumption of an increasing optical depth ( e.g.  due to continuous injection of relativistic electrons ) can cause a delay of the maximum at high frequencies with respect to the lower frequencies , and therefore explain at least one of the special features .",
    "variable doppler boosting can cause simultaneous short - term variability in all observed wave bands .",
    "fairly pronounced time lags between the different frequencies can be caused by turnover frequency variations in the observed spectrum of a moving source .",
    "however , broader peaks are expected at longer wavelengths",
    ".    free - free absorption and interstellar scattering are only capable of explaining radio variations , not variability in the optical regime .",
    "therefore , if the connection between the optical and the radio variability is real , these models are ruled out as the only cause for the variations .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of the timescales on wavelength argues against an explanation of the flare by interstellar scattering .",
    "the absorption by a patchy foreground medium can easily describe the shape and the widths of the flares ( in the radio ) and can  if we assume different locations for the brightness center  also explain the time sequence of the brightness peaks .",
    "gravitational microlensing  in combination with a wavelength - dependent source size and a slight displacement of the brightness peak  provides a possible explanation for the observed variations in the radio regime .",
    "one would also expect fairly strong variability in the visible range , because of the much smaller source size .",
    "microlensing thus appears to be a viable explanation of the observations , which is also quite attractive because of the known foreground objects .",
    "it is quite remarkable that these attempts to explain the rapid radio variability in 0235 + 164  different as they are  all imply that the intrinsic source size is very small . to reconcile the observations with the 10@xmath55k inverse compton limit , a doppler factor substantially higher than the `` canonical '' value of 10 ( see e.g.  ghisellini et al .",
    "1993 , zensus  1997 ) is required .",
    "most scenarios that we have investigated imply @xmath56 . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that circumstantial evidence for superluminal motion with @xmath57 has been found in this source ( chu et al .",
    "the variations in 0235 + 164 are also among the strongest and fastest of all sources in the michigan monitoring program ( e.g.  hughes et al .",
    "this suggests that the distribution of doppler factors in compact radio sources has a tail extending to @xmath56 , and that 0235 + 164  and perhaps more generally the sources showing strong intraday radio variability  belong to this tail .",
    "the implied extremely small source size can allow rapid intrinsic variations , and at the same time favor propagation effects .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the observed variability is caused by a superposition of both mechanisms ."
