    "@xcite the undoped compounds are somewhat simpler as their properties are dominated by large on - site coulomb interactions @xmath9 , responsible for their mott - hubbard ( or charge - transfer ) insulating behavior , with the effective low - energy magnetic interactions of superexchange type . while such interactions are af and nonfrustrated on a cubic lattice for nondegenerate orbitals , they have a very nontrivial structure when degenerate @xmath8 orbitals are partly occupied , as pointed out by kugel and khomskii on the example of @xmath10 systems long ago.@xcite in such cases the _ orbital degrees of freedom _ have to be considered on equal footing with electron spins,@xcite which leads to the so - called spin - orbital superexchange models , @xcite describing the low - energy physics and the partial sum rules in the optical spectroscopy.@xcite    an intriguing feature of the spin - orbital models is the strong frustration of the superexchange interactions on a cubic ( perovskite ) lattice which was recognized as the origin of enhanced quantum effects in transition metal oxides.@xcite for purely electronic models this frustration might even lead to the collapse of long range order in particular parameter regimes , but usually this does not happen and the fluctuations are partly suppressed either by the order - out - of - disorder mechanism,@xcite or by the coupling to the lattice distortions induced by the jahn - teller ( jt ) effect . in the cuprates and manganites both the superexchange and",
    "the jt interactions support each other , @xcite and such systems undergo usually structural transitions . nevertheless , even below the structural transition the spin and orbital degrees of freedom",
    "are coupled , leading to characteristic changes of the orbital order ( oo ) at magnetic transitions and to new composite spin - orbital excitations , when both spin and orbital excitation occurs simultaneously.@xcite    the importance of the orbital degrees of freedom was realized in the theory of magnetism already in the seventies .",

    "as realized first for the @xmath12 configuration in cubic titanates,@xcite the quantum effects are here even stronger than in the @xmath10 systems ( cuprates or manganites ) , as the jt coupling is weak and the orbitals may form the coherent orbital liquid state observed in a mott insulator latio@xmath6 .",

    "thus , the difference between the @xmath5-af and @xmath4-af phase of yvo@xmath6 is much deeper than simply the observed difference in the magnetic order .",
    "it is far more important that the _ orbital state softens _ at the transition at @xmath24 to the @xmath4-af phase and this change happens in a concerted way with the observed reorientation of the magnetic moments .",
    "in addition , the intrinsic instability in the orbital sector towards dimerization , which is incompatible with the magnetic order in the @xmath5-af phase and is blocked by spin correlations in the @xmath4-af phase at @xmath36 , becomes possible when the intersite ferromagnetic spin correlations along @xmath7 axis have been somewhat weakened with increasing temperature .",
    "although we have suggested a plausible scenario of the observed magnetic phase transition in yvo@xmath6 , the microscopic theory of the @xmath4-af phase at finite temperature remains still to be constructed .",

    "furthermore , it is puzzling whether dimerization also plays a role in reducing the the magnetic order parameter in the @xmath4-af phase which is hard to explain using the spin - wave theory , or the above entanglement is the main reason responsible for this reduction .",
    "note however that it could be argued that the observed orientation of the magnetic moments which are close to lying within the @xmath17 planes is enforced by the dimerization in the @xmath4-af phase .",
    "some other problems remain still open and should be treated in future more complete theory .",
    "we note that also in the @xmath5-af phase a considerable reduction of the magnetic order parameter@xcite goes beyond that expected from the quantum fluctuations.@xcite we believe that the relativistic spin - orbit coupling @xmath361 contributes significantly to the magnetic properties in the entire regime of temperature,@xcite in particular also to the spin correlations in the @xmath5-af phase , and could reduce the observed value of the magnetization .",

    "was ignored , as in the considered regime of @xmath363 it could lead just to the perturbative corrections of the presented spin and orbital excitations .",
    "in contrast , in the regime of @xmath364 it would lead to ordering of orbitals with complex coefficients , @xmath365 , with finite orbital angular momentum.@xcite although the cubic vanadates are not in this regime of parameters , finite spin - orbit coupling @xmath362 would be crucial for quantitative understanding of spin ( and orbital ) excitations in the entire parameter regime .",
    "this interaction provides another mechanism for the softening of spin excitations in the @xmath4-af phase , which would complement the scenario considered in this paper .",
    "we also note that a small @xmath5-like magnetization component was observed as well in the @xmath4-af phase in the temperature range @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , it is likely that this magnetic phase is still more complex than suggested in the present paper , and requires a more careful analysis .",
    "recent progress in experimental methods makes it possible to measure also orbital excitations , @xcite and information on the orbital excitations in yvo@xmath6 would be instrumental to resolve some of the above problems .    summarizing",
