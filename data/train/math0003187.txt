    "the kontsevich integral of a knot in @xmath2 is a graph - valued invariant , which is characterized by a universal property , namely it is a universal @xmath3-valued vassiliev invariant of knots .",
    "using the language of physics , the kontsevich integral is the feynmann diagram expansion ( i.e. , perturbative expansion ) of the chern - simons path integral , expanded around a trivial flat connection , @xcite .",
    "this explains the shape of the graphs ( namely , they have univalent and trivalent vertices only ) , their vertex - orientation and their vassiliev degree , namely half the number of vertices",
    ".    in physics one often takes the logarithm of a feynmann diagram expansion , which is given by a series of connected graphs , and one studies the the terms with a fixed number of loops ( i.e. , with a fixed first betti number ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the kontsevich integral , graded by the euler degree ( rather than the vassiliev degree , or the number of loops ) , to introduce a null - move on knots , and to relate the euler degree to the null - move .",
    "this point of view explains in a natural way a rationality conjecture of the kontsevich integral ( formulated by the second author and proven by @xcite ) , the relation of the null - move to @xmath0-equivalence , the relation of the null - move to cyclic branched covers @xcite , and offers an opportunity to use vassiliev invariants as obstructions to the existence of seifert forms , @xcite .",
    "we begin by explaining the euler expansion of the kontsevich integral @xmath4 , defined for links in @xmath2 by kontsevich , @xcite , and extended to an invariant of links in arbitrary closed 3-manifolds by the work of le - murakami - ohtsuki , @xcite .",
    "our paper will focus on the above invariant @xmath5 of knots @xmath6 in s @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the completed vector space over @xmath3 generated by unitrivalent graphs with vertex - orientations modulo the well - known antisymmetry @xmath10 and @xmath11 relations .",
    "the graphs in question have a vassiliev degree ( given by half the number of vertices ) and the completion of @xmath9 refers to the vassiliev degree .",
    "we now introduce a second grading on unitrivalent graphs : the _ euler degree _",
    "@xmath12 of a unitrivalent graph @xmath13 is the number of trivalent vertices that remain when we shave - off all legs of @xmath13 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the euler characteristic of @xmath13 , which explains the naming of this degree .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 relations are homogeneous with respect to the euler degree , thus we can let @xmath16 denote the euler degree @xmath1 part of the kontsevich integral .",
    "notice that there are finitely many unitrivalent graphs with vassiliev degree @xmath1 , but infinitely many connected graphs with euler degree @xmath1 .",
    "for example , wheels with @xmath1 legs have vassiliev degree @xmath1 but euler degree @xmath17 .",
    "the kontsevich integral of a knot , graded by the vassiliev degree is a universal vassiliev . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath16 are not vassiliev invariants ; they are rather power series of vassiliev invariants .    why consider the euler degree ?",
    "a deep and unexpected geometric reason is the content of the next section .",
    "a beautiful theory of goussarov and habiro is the study of the geometric notion of _ surgery on a clasper _ , see @xcite and @xcite ( in the latter claspers were called clovers ) . following the notation of @xcite , given a clasper @xmath13 in a 3-manifold @xmath19 ,",
    "we let @xmath20 denote the result of surgery .",
    "clasper surgery can be described in terms of twisting genus @xmath21 handlebodies in @xmath19 , or alternatively in terms of surgery on a framed link in @xmath19 .",
    "we will refer the reader to @xcite for the definition and conventions of surgery on a clasper .",
    "we will _ exclude _ claspers with no trivalent vertices , that is , ones that generate @xmath22-moves .    in the present paper we are interested in pairs @xmath23 and claspers @xmath24",
    "whose leaves are _ null homologous links _ in @xmath25 .",
    "we will call such claspers @xmath18-_null _ , or simply _ null_.",
    "the terminology is motivated by the fact that the leaves of such claspers are sent to @xmath17 under the map : @xmath26 .    in order to motivate our interest in null claspers ,",
    "recall the basic and fundamental principle : surgery on a clasper preserves the homology and ( when defined ) the linking form . applying that principle in the @xmath18-cover of a knot complement",
    ", it follows that surgery on a null clasper preserves the blanchfield form , as we will see below .",
    "surgery on null claspers describes a move on the set of knots in s. given this move , one can define in the usual fashion a notion of _ s _ and a dual notion of @xmath1-_equivalence _ , as was explained by goussarov and habiro .",
    "explicitly , we can consider a decreasing filtration @xmath27 on the vector space generated by all pairs @xmath23 as follows : @xmath28 is generated by @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30 is a disjoint collection of null claspers in @xmath25 , and where @xmath31=\\sum_{i \\subset \\{0,1\\}^n } ( -1)^{|i| } ( m , k)_{g_i}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath32 denotes the number of elements of @xmath22 and @xmath33 stands for the result of simultaneous surgery on claspers @xmath34 for all @xmath35 ) .    a function @xmath36 is a _  of null - type _",
    "@xmath1 iff @xmath37 .",
    "we will discuss the general notion of @xmath1-null - equivalence in a later publication , at present we will consider the special case of @xmath38 .",
    "two pairs @xmath23 and @xmath39 are _ null - equivalent _ iff one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of null moves .    in order to motivate the next lemma ,",
    "recall a result of matveev @xcite , who showed that two closed 3-manifolds @xmath7 and @xmath40 are equivalent under a sequence of clasper surgeries iff they have the same homology and linking form .",
    "this answer is particularly pleasing since it is expressed in terms of abelian algebraic invariants .    the following are equivalent : @xmath23 and @xmath39    * are null equivalent * are @xmath0-equivalent * have isometric blanchfield form .    for a definition of @xmath0-_equivalence _ and _",
    "blanchfield forms _ , see for example @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath23 and @xmath39 are @xmath0-equivalent iff they have isometric blanchfield forms ; for an algebraic - topological proof of that combine levine and kearton , @xcite , or alternatively trotter , @xcite .",
    "thus ( b ) is equivalent to ( c ) .",
    "if @xmath39 is obtained from @xmath23 by a null move on a clasper @xmath13 , then @xmath13 lifts to the universal abelian cover @xmath41 of the knot complement @xmath42 .",
    "the lift @xmath43 of @xmath13 is a union of claspers translated by by the group @xmath18 of deck transformations .",
    "furthermore , @xmath44 is obtained from @xmath41 by surgery on @xmath43 .",
    "since clasper surgery preserves the homology and linking form , it follows that @xmath39 and @xmath23 have isometric blanchfield forms , thus ( a ) implies ( c ) .",
    "suppose now that @xmath39 is @xmath0-equivalent to @xmath23 .",
    "then , by matveev s result , the  @xmath7 can be obtained from @xmath2 by surgery on some null @xmath13 . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath6 is a knot in @xmath7 that bounds a seifert surface @xmath45 , we can always arrange ( by an isotopy on @xmath13 ) that @xmath13 is disjoint from @xmath45 , thus @xmath13 is @xmath23-null .",
    "thus , if @xmath23 and @xmath39 are @xmath0-equivalent pairs , modulo null moves we can assume that @xmath46 . in that case , naik and stanford show that @xmath0-equivalent pairs @xmath47 and @xmath48 are equivalent under a sequence of double @xmath49elta - moves , that is null - moves where all the leaves of the clasper bound disjoint disks , @xcite . thus , ( b ) implies ( a ) and the lemma follows .",
    "it follows that if @xmath23 and @xmath39 are null equivalent , then they have the same alexander module , in particular the same alexander polynomial , and the same algebraic concordance invariants which were classified by levine @xcite .",
    "there is a well - known similarity between @xmath50-valued linking forms of rational homology spheres and @xmath51$]-valued blanchfield forms . from this point of view ,  correspond to knots with trivial alexander polynomial .",

    ", we will translate well - known results about s and @xmath1-equivalence of s to the setting of knots with trivial alexander polynomial .    are there any nontrivial s of null - type ?",
    "the next result answers this , and reveals an unexpected relation between the null - move and the euler degree :    for all @xmath1 , @xmath52 is a null - type @xmath1 invariant of pairs @xmath23 with values in @xmath53 .    in the above",
    ", @xmath54 stands for the subspace of @xmath9 generated by diagrams of euler - degree @xmath1 .",
    "the above theorem has implications for the _ loop expansion _ of the kontsevich integral defined as follows .",
    "the logarithm of the kontsevich integral @xmath55 takes values in the completed vector space ( with respect to the vassiliev degree ) @xmath56 generated by connected vertex - oriented unitrivalent graphs , modulo the @xmath10 and @xmath11 relations .",
    "let us define the _ loop degree _ of a graph to be the number of loops , i.e. , the first betti number .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 relations are homogeneous with respect to the loop degree , thus we can define @xmath57 to be the @xmath58-loop degree of @xmath59 . since a connected trivalent graph with @xmath60 loops has euler degree @xmath61 , and since @xmath59 is an additive invariant of pairs under connected sum , it follows that    for all @xmath1 , @xmath57 is an additive null - type @xmath61 invariant of pairs @xmath23 with values in the loop - degree @xmath58 part of @xmath56 .",
    "our next task is to study the graded quotients @xmath62 ; knowing this would essentially answer the question of how many null - s there are .",
    "since null equivalence has more than one equivalence classes , we ought to study @xmath27 and @xmath63 on each null equivalence class .",
    "this is formalized in the following way .",
    "given a pair @xmath23 , let @xmath64 denote the subspace of @xmath27 generated by all pairs @xmath39 which are null equivalent to @xmath23 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath65 when @xmath23 and @xmath39 are null equivalent and that we have a direct sum decomposition @xmath66 fixing @xmath23 , we can define @xmath67 accordingly .",
    "the simplest case to study are the graded quotients @xmath68 for the unknot @xmath69 in @xmath2 .",
    "this is equivalent to the study of null-  of knots with trivial alexander polynomial .",
    "it turns out in a perhaps unexpected way that @xmath68 can be described in terms of trivalent graphs with _",

    "the `` abelian '' and  solvable  invariants of knots with trivial alexander polynomial , such as their alexander module , casson - gordon invariants and all of their recent systematic obstructions of cochran - orr - teichner @xcite vanish .",
    "however , already the euler degree @xmath86 part of the kontsevich integral @xmath94 ( which incidentally equals to the @xmath86-loop part of @xmath4 ) does not vanish on alexander polynomial @xmath91 knots .",

    "@xmath95 in the final section [ sub.kbehavior ] we show that the hairy strut part of the kontsevich integral satisfies the same axioms as the equivariant linking numbers , and as a consequence of a uniqueness result , the two are equal .",
    "in this section we recall briefly the definition of surgery on claspers , with the notation of @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed description . a framed graph @xmath13 in a 3-manifold @xmath7 is called a _ clasper of degree _",

    "surgery on @xmath13 can be described either by surgery on the corresponding framed six component link , or in terms of cutting a neighborhood of @xmath13 , ( which is a handlebody of genus @xmath21 ) , twisting by a fixed diffeomorphism of its boundary and gluing back .",
    "@xmath100    a clasper of higher degree is a ( thickening of ) an embedded trivalent graph , with some distinguished loops which we call _ leaves_. the degree of a clasper is the number of trivalent vertices , excluding those of the leaves .",
    "surgery on claspers of higher degree is defined similarly .",
    "for example , a clasper of degree @xmath86 and its corresponding surgery link are shown below : @xmath101    surgery on a clasper of degree @xmath1 can be described in terms of surgery on @xmath1 claspers of degree @xmath91 .",
    "we will exclude claspers of degree @xmath17 , that is with no trivalent vertices . these correspond to @xmath22-moves in the language of goussarov and habiro .      as we mentioned in the introduction ( see remark [ rem.linkingform ] ) , the study of the graded quotients @xmath96 is entirely analogous to the study of the graded quotients @xmath102 of s of s. for a detailed description of the latter invariants , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "let us recall here some key ideas , for later use .",
    "let @xmath103 denote the vector space over @xmath3 generated by s , and let @xmath104 denote the subspace of @xmath103 generated by @xmath105 $ ] for all disjoint collections of claspers @xmath106 in s @xmath7 , where @xmath107=\\sum_{i \\subset \\{0,1\\}^n } ( -1)^{|i| } m_{g_i}\\ ] ] compare with equation .",

    "choose an embedding @xmath113 that preserves its vertex - orientation .",
    "recall that a vertex - orientation is a cyclic order of the set of three flags around a trivalent vertex .",
    "an embedding @xmath114 gives rise at each vertex @xmath115 to a frame that consists of the tangent vectors of the images under @xmath114 of the three flags around @xmath116 . comparing this frame with the standard orientation of @xmath2",
