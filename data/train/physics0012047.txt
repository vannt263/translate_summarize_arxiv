    "the study of homogeneous isotropic turbulence has as its aim the derivation of the statistical features of small scale velocity fluctuations at high reynolds numbers , based on the assumption that they exhibit universal characteristics independent of the form of the large scale flow structures [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "a key quantity of interest is the longitudinal velocity increment , @xmath11 where @xmath12 the velocity component @xmath13 and the separation distance @xmath14 both being in the same direction , here the @xmath15-axis .",
    "an empirical fact is that its @xmath3th order moment , the longitudinal structure function @xmath16 , defined by @xmath17 exhibits multiscaling .",
    "that is , the exponent @xmath0 , defined by the scaling relation @xmath18 is a nonlinear function of the order @xmath19 this behaviour is not explained by the classical turbulence theory of kolmogorov [ 4 ] which yields a linear dependence @xmath20 moreover , the amount by which @xmath0 differs from @xmath21 called the anomaly , has proved stubbornly resistant to attempts at quantitative explanation [ 1 - 3,5,6 ] .",
    "the obstacle to progress with the theory is the strong nonlinearity of the governing navier - stokes ( ns ) equations . in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to show how modern statistical field theory can be used to overcome this difficulty and provide theoretical predictions for @xmath22 , which agree well with turbulent flow data .",
    "the idea that statistical field theory can be brought to bear on the problem of turbulence is not itself new .",
    "indeed , interest in describing turbulence in terms of the underlying functional probability distribution of the velocity field , together with its corresponding generating functional @xmath23 has a long history [ 5,6 ] .",
    "but such work has suffered from the weakness of relying on conventional perturbation theory to effect closure of the statistical hierarchy , whereas it is widely believed that a non - perturbative treatment is necessary , because the ns equations lack a small parameter.consequently , progress with this approach has been disappointing .",
    "the question is whether we can find a middle course , which avoids the limitations of conventional perturbation theory , while not demanding an intractable non - perturbative approach . here",
    "we explore the possibility of formulating a more efficient perturbation theory by developing a zero - order solution which already accounts for the dominant nonlinear interactions , in an attempt , as it were , to deplete the effect of the nonlinearity .",
    "we shall do this by adopting a more general quadratic form in @xmath24 in place of the viscous form which arises naturally .",
    "the modified quadratic form is determined self - consistently from the ns nonlinearity using the linear response function and the energy equation . in the inertial range",
    ", it leads directly to the kolmogorov distribution , after allowing for the kinematic effect of the sweeping of the smaller scales by the larger ones .",
    "the difference between these quadratic forms then appears as a perturbation , which , as we shall see , is not critical , provided that the force spectrum function is non - zero only at small wavenumbers and yields a finite input power .",
    "having incorporated the dominant nonlinearities which are responsible for the turbulence energy cascade into the zero - order solution , what is then lacking is the effect of the fluctuating dissipation rate , which is the well - known defect of the kolmogorov theory [ 5 ] . in this approach ,",
    "the perturbation theory is then , in effect , only required to accommodate the residual coupling associated with these fluctuations , which are directly responsible for the anomalies .",
    "the fact that the anomalies are small , and associated with a weak residual coupling , provides good reason to expect that a small expansion parameter might emerge , thereby rendering the problem accessible to perturbation theory , essentially by means of a standard loop - expansion of the generating functional .",
    "although the use of the modified quadratic form as an initial approximation would appear to be an attractive option , providing a sound physical basis for the approximate evaluation of the generating functional , it poses severe technical problems , the most significant being the occurrence of divergences at higher orders in perturbation theory , due to the incomplete representation of the large scale flow .",
    "these divergences are of two types : power divergences ( including power @xmath25 logarithmic ) , which are associated with the sweeping and pure logarithmic divergences , which describe the cascade process .  on the other hand , statistical field theory [ 7 ] , provides the mathematical techniques needed to compensate for such divergences , in the form of the well - known processes of resummation and renormalisation . in particular , renormalisation [ 8 ] provides a procedure whereby the scale invariance in ( [ a2 ] ) can be recovered from a divergent theory , yielding the exponents in terms of the anomalous dimensions of the composite operators appearing in ( [ a1 ] ) , which we can calculate from the appropriate nonlinear green s functions .",
    "the modified quadratic form itself follows uniquely from the requirement for the absence of non - renormalisable terms , after renormalising the basic parameters of @xmath24 and allowing for sweeping .",
    "fortunately , sweeping effects do not pose an insuperable obstacle , notwithstanding that the initial formulation is eulerian .",
    "indeed , we show that the power divergences associated with sweeping can be removed by introducing a single sweeping interaction term , which can be derived from the generating functional itself using a random galilean transformation of the velocity field , having an _ rms _ convection speed which is calculated from the ns nonlinearity",
    ". the application of this transformation does not , of course , affect the values of @xmath16 and , thus , enables the straining interactions which determine the spectrum to be separated from the background of sweeping convection , yielding , in effect , quasi - lagrangian forms .  in this way ,",
    "as we shall show below , it proves possible to demonstrate multiscaling and calculate the anomalies of the structure functions accurately .",
    "our starting point is the ns equations , describing flow in an incompressible fluid of unit density , velocity @xmath26 kinematic viscosity @xmath27 and pressure @xmath28 , and driven by a random solenoidal stirring force @xmath29 , which are @xmath30 and    @xmath31    suppose that    @xmath32    is the solution of ( [ a4 ] ) at the space - time point @xmath33 corresponding to a force @xmath34 , which has a gaussian probability distribution @xmath35 then the generating functional @xmath24 for the correlation functions of the velocity field can be written as the functional integral @xmath36 where the source term is given by @xmath37 and the correlators follow by functional differentiation with respect to the source field @xmath38 given that we can not obtain an explicit expression for the solution ( [ a6 ] ) , the crux of the problem is how to approximate ( [ a7 ] ) with the accuracy required to calculate the @xmath39 . in our approach ,",
    "as indicated above , we prove that the kolmogorov theory can be used effectively as a mean field theory in a saddle - point evaluation of ( [ a7 ] ) , and that this leads to an expansion which has a genuinely small coupling constant .     within the context of a field theoretic interpretation of ( [ a7 ] ) , each term of the binomial expansion of ( [ a1 ] ) must be regarded as an operator product of the usual wilson type , ( see eg [ 7,8 ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , the powers of @xmath40 must be treated as composite operators , which , in accordance with standard procedures [ 7 ] , must be generated from @xmath24 by independent sources . here , our aim is to limit the composite operators that need to be allowed for to those which appear explicitly in the definition of @xmath41 as given in ( [ a1 ] ) . to this end , we define a set of longitudinal composite operators @xmath42 for @xmath43 by @xmath44 which we generate from @xmath24 by adding to the source term ( [ a8 ] ) , the additional term @xmath45    we also need to include in the definition of @xmath24 a means of establishing the vital link between the time - independent definition of @xmath16 and the dynamics of the turbulence .",
    "this requires the introduction of a dynamic response operator , which we define to be the functional differentiation operator @xmath46 its inclusion in the definition of @xmath24 adds a final source term to @xmath47 given by @xmath48 where summation over repeated vector indices is implied here and below .    the terms ( [ a8 ] ) , ( [ a10 ] ) and ( [ a12 ] ) together constitute the full source term for ( [ a7 ] ) which becomes , therefore , @xmath49 and this completes the definition of @xmath50 thus , ( [ a7 ] ) and ( [ a13 ] ) provide the foundation of our approach to the calculation of @xmath0 .",
    "however , before we proceed with this calculation , we need to cast @xmath24 into a conventional field theory form , and introduce the modified quadratic form .",
    "a straightforward method of transforming ( [ a7 ] ) into a conventional field theory form is to replace @xmath51 by its functional fourier transform and then integrate over @xmath52 .",
    "this is the stage at which we make explicit use of the ns equations .",
    "essentially , to effect the transformation , we change our perspective by replacing the velocity field @xmath53 generated by the force @xmath54by the force @xmath55 needed to excite a particular realisation @xmath56 of the flow field .",
    "the operator ( [ a11 ] ) is then replaced by an equivalent conjugate vector field @xmath57 .    to carry out this transformation , we work in the fourier domain setting @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes @xmath60 , so that @xmath61 , while @xmath62 then , from ( [ a4 ] ) and ( [ a5 ] ) , we have @xmath63 the notation here is the following .",
    "@xmath64 is the zero - order approximation to the response function @xmath65 defined below in ( [ a87 ] ) and ( [ a92 ] ) , namely @xmath66 where @xmath67 @xmath68 is the ns vertex defined by @xmath69 where @xmath70",
    "next we write the gaussian distribution of *  * @xmath52 *  * in the form @xmath71 for which the corresponding force covariance is @xmath72 where the force spectrum function @xmath73 is an arbitrary function which is assumed to be peaked near the origin so that the power input @xmath74 is finite .",
    "we now change the functional integration over @xmath52 in ( [ a7 ] ) to an integration over @xmath56 by means of the transformation @xmath75 , and substitute the representation @xmath76 since the jacobian only contributes an unimportant constant , we get @xmath77 { \\cal d}{\\bf v}\\,{\\cal % d}\\widetilde{{\\bf v } } ,   \\label{a23}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 while the source term ( [ a13 ] ) becomes @xmath79 the expression ( [ a23 ] ) casts @xmath24 into the form of an msr type functional integral [ 9 ] .    now the quadratic form appearing in ( [ a24 ] ) does not provide a good initial approximation for inertial range scaling because , of course , it merely describes the viscous decay of an externally driven random flow , with no account taken of the nonlinear interactions .",
    "it is thus essential in developing an expansion theorem for ( [ a23 ] ) to introduce a more appropriate quadratic form . now",
    "the general theory of quadratic forms in a hilbert space indicates that we can introduce at most two functions.these can be taken as an apparent force spectrum @xmath80 and an effective micro timescale @xmath81 , which are related to the energy in wavemode @xmath82 , @xmath83 , by @xmath84 the modified quadratic form in @xmath85 is then obtained , firstly , by replacing @xmath73 with @xmath80 and , secondly , by replacing the viscous timescale @xmath86 by the the effective timescale @xmath87 , so that the viscous propagator ( [ a16 ] ) in ( [ a15 ] ) is replaced by @xmath88 thus , we now have in place of ( [ a24 ] ) @xmath89 in which @xmath80 and @xmath81 are , as yet , unknown functions to be determined in an appropriate way from the energy equation and the linear response function .",
    "the idea that one should replace the viscous quadratic form by a modified form was suggested originally in [ 10 ] , where it was used in conjunction with a variational principle based on an entropy functional , but recent work [ 11 ] has shown that this approach contains an arbitrary element .",
    "however , we shall not need to invoke any additional principle , because we shall be able to deduce the modified quadratic form in a self - consistent way from the 1-loop expansion , as we have already indicated .",
    "the introduction of the modified quadratic form as a basis for an expansion theorem for ( [ a23 ] ) requires the inclusion of the difference terms as perturbations , which contributes an additional term to @xmath90 given by @xmath91 these terms have the same form as the counterterms introduced below in ( [ a183 ] ) to accommodate the pure logarithmic divergences but their role , as we shall see , is not critical as regards calculating the inertial range exponents .    the derivation of the functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 occurring in the modified quadratic form entails a detailed discussion of sweeping convection , the structure of the feynman diagrams associated with the loop expansion of @xmath24 and the establishment of the condition for the absence from the linear response function of non - renormalisable terms",
    "we shall defer detailed discussion of these topics until sections [ section7 ] and [ section8 ] and , meanwhile , proceed with the calculation of the anomalous exponents by anticipating their forms , which , in the inertial range , are @xmath92 and @xmath93 clearly , these forms imply that the zero order solution behaves in the inertial range _ as if _ the fluid were stirred by a random force with a @xmath94 force correlation spectrum and responds to it with a lagrangian time scale @xmath95 .",
    "thus , they lead to the kolmogorov distribution.we shall explain how this result follows from the generating functional in section [ section8 ] .",
    "the advantage of this approximation is that it achieves a prime requirement of any efficient perturbation theory , which is a zero - order approximation that already closely approximates the desired solution .     on the other hand , as we have indicated ,",
    "the resulting perturbation theory yields divergences at higher orders . but",
    "these divergences can be handled by standard renormalisation procedures .",
    "fortunately , as regards the calculation of @xmath0 , we need consider only logarithmic divergences . as discussed above , this is because the power divergences represent the kinematic effect of the sweeping of small scales by larger scales .",
    "indeed , as we shall show in section [ section7 ] , such terms are precisely those which can be generated by applying a random galilean transformation of the velocity field to @xmath50 consequently , they can be cancelled by introducing the appropriate vertex into @xmath24 , yielding quasi - lagrangian approximations .",
    "hence , from a purely practical calculational point of view , the effect of sweeping can be removed from the calculation of @xmath0 simply by discarding power divergences .",
    "we are then left with the logarithmic divergences , which we can sum by renormalisation group methods .",
    "thus , an important implication of using the modified quadratic form as an initial approximation for the calculation of @xmath0 is that renormalisation becomes a necessary preliminary .",
    "so we need to identify the counterterms which arise in @xmath24 under renormalisation and obtain the transformation rule which connects the bare and renormalised generating functionals .",
    "renormalisation is applied to the viscosity and force constants appearing in ( [ a184 ] ) and ( [ a185 ] ) in the usual way by introducing renormalisation constants @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which relate their bare values @xmath98 and @xmath99 to their renormalised replacements @xmath100 and @xmath101 by @xmath102 this generates counterterms in ( [ a24 ] ) for the elementary fields @xmath103 and @xmath104 given by @xmath105 where we have defined renormalisation constant increments by @xmath106 the additional renormalisation which must be applied to the composite operators ( [ a9 ] ) also takes the standard form @xmath107 the corresponding counterterm is obtained by substituting ( [ a31 ] ) in ( [ a25 ] ) to get @xmath108 where @xmath109    we conclude this section by giving the transformation which relates the generating functional of the bare correlation functions @xmath110 to its corresponding renormalised form @xmath111 .  to provide a convenient means of handling the dependence of the correlation and response functions on the dimensional parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 , we rescale @xmath112 and @xmath29 by introducing bare fields defined by @xmath113 and @xmath114 with bare frequency @xmath115 these bare fields preserve the form of the ns equations , apart from explicitly introducing the non - dimensional coupling constant , defined by @xmath116 in which the appropriateness of the numerical factor will appear later from the loop - expansion of @xmath50    under the renormalisation ( [ a28 ] ) , the bare fields are replaced by renormalised fields , to which they are related by @xmath117 and @xmath118 where @xmath119 these relations follow from two requirements .",
    "first , the form of the ns equations ( [ a15 ] ) must again be preserved , with the new constants @xmath100 and @xmath120 resulting in a renormalised coupling constant @xmath121 second , we have to satisfy the crucial requirement that @xmath122 as given in ( [ a20 ] ) , remains invariant under renormalisation .",
    "indeed , satisfaction of these conditions implies the desired relation between @xmath110 and @xmath111 , which from ( [ a23 ] ) and ( [ a25 ] ) , is readily found to be @xmath123    the foregoing provides the basis of our calculation of @xmath0 , which involves the following four stages .",
    "first , we use ( [ a42 ] ) and the binomial expansion of ( [ a1 ] ) to develop a short distance expansion for @xmath124 by substituting an operator product expansion ( ope ) [ 7,8 ] for each term , based on the operators ( [ a9 ] ) . as shown in section [ section3",
    "] , this yields the scaling of @xmath16 in terms of @xmath2 fixed point values of standard rg functions .",
    "the second stage of the calculation is to demonstrate that the required @xmath2 fixed point of the rg actually exists , and then to deduce the corresponding fixed point coupling constant @xmath125 .",
    "this is done in section [ section4 ] by considering the renormalisation of the linear response function , using the renormalised functional in the form obtained from ( [ a23 ] ) .",
    "the third stage is to calculate the specific fixed point rg parameters which give the anomalous component of @xmath0 . to do this",
    ", we have to consider the renormalisation of appropriate nonlinear green s functions involving the composite operators defined in ( [ a9 ] ) .",
    "these are identified and evaluated in section [ section5 ] .",
    "having calculated the anomalous scaling exponent @xmath126 of the @xmath28th term in the binomial expansion of @xmath127 , in the fourth and final stage of the calculation , we derive a simple algebraic expression for @xmath0 by maximising  @xmath128 , with respect to integer values of @xmath28 , and subtracting this maximum from the kolmogorov value ( [ a3 ] ) .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath0 are presented in section [ section6 ] , where they are shown to be in good agreement with experimental measurements at all orders for which reliable data exists .",
    "finally , the mathematical proofs , deferred during the calculation of the exponents , are presented in sections [ section7]-[section9 ] , and comprise : ( a ) the demonstration that sweeping effects can be eliminated by means of a random galilean transformation of the velocity field ; ( b ) the derivation of the modified quadratic form from the 1-loop expansion ; and ( c ) the derivation of the dominant terms of the opes .",
    "in applying the ope technique to ( [ a1 ] ) the first point to appreciate is that the orders @xmath129 @xmath130 and @xmath131 require separate treatment .",
    "the factor distinguishing @xmath132 and @xmath133 from the higher order @xmath1 is that the latter involve composite operator products , whereas @xmath132 and @xmath134 do not . also ,",
    "@xmath133 is exceptional in representing a transition at which corrections to the kolmogorov exponents ( [ a3 ] ) change from positive at @xmath135 to negative at @xmath136 , with no correction occurring at @xmath130 in accordance with the known exact scaling law , which is verified , within the present framework , in section [ section8 ] .",
    "this sign change is caused precisely because composite operator products appear in @xmath137 when @xmath138    we begin , therefore , with the relatively straightforward case of @xmath132 . according to ( [ a1 ] ) , we have @xmath139 which shows that the scaling of @xmath132 is determined by the behaviour of the operator product @xmath140 as @xmath141 .",
    "the form of its ope is established in section [ section9 ] after the necessary mathematical apparatus has been set up .",
    "its proof is given there to the accuracy of the calculation , ie up to and including terms of order @xmath142 .",
    "we shall show that  the operators which appear in its ope are : ( a ) the unit operator @xmath143 , with constant coefficient @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the turbulence energy ; ( b ) the dominant longitudinal quadratic composite operator @xmath146 , which gives the leading scaling behaviour ; and ( c ) subdominant operators including all transverse operators and the longitudinal higher order composite operators @xmath147 .",
    "however , we shall only be concerned with the dominant operators and so we write the expansion as   @xmath148 where the dots indicate the additional subdominant terms.the scaling behaviour of this operator product can be found in the usual way from the rg equation satisfied by the leading wilson coefficient @xmath149  [ 12 ] .",
    "we start by considering an arbitrary equal time correlation function of order @xmath150 , given by @xmath151  if we insert ( [ a44 ] ) into this correlation function , we get @xmath152 where , in general , @xmath153  is the inserted correlation function defined by    @xmath154    and @xmath155 is a unit vector along the @xmath15-axis .    we can deduce the rg equation satisfied by the wilson coefficient @xmath156 in ( [ a44 ] ) from ( [ a46 ] ) , given the rg equations satisfied by @xmath157 and @xmath158 . to obtain the latter , we need the transformation rule for the equal time generator of these correlation functions , which we denote by @xmath159).this follows in a straightforward manner by taking time independent sources in ( [ a42 ] ) , and integrating with respect to @xmath160 and @xmath161 , with the @xmath162dependence , which is irrelevant here , suppressed . to simplify the result , we shall anticipate the fact , which we demonstrate in section [ section4 ] , that @xmath163 we then get @xmath164    according to this relation , the bare and renormalised forms of @xmath157 are equal .",
    "hence , when we change the renormalisation scale , which we denote by @xmath165 , the fourier transform of @xmath157  changes according to the rg equation @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the standard rg operator defined by @xmath168 with @xmath169 in the case of @xmath170 , we obtain from ( [ a47 ] ) and ( [ a49 ] ) the relation @xmath171 which leads to the rg equation @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the anomalous dimension of @xmath174 given by @xmath175 for ease of notation , we have dropped the suffix @xmath176 in the rg equations ( [ a50 ] ) and ( [ a54 ] ) , since we shall always be dealing with relations between renormalised functions .",
    "we now apply the rg operator ( [ a51 ] ) to the fourier transform of ( [ a46 ] ) , and make use of ( [ a50 ] ) and ( [ a54 ] ) , to get @xmath177 as this equation holds for arbitrary @xmath158 , it follows that @xmath178 which is the rg equation satisfied by the wilson coefficients in ( [ a44 ] ) .",
    "the standard solution of this equation , corresponding to an _ uv _ fixed point [ 12 ] , now gives for the leading term of ( [ a44 ] ) the scaling behaviour @xmath179 where the star denotes the fixed point value of ( [ a55 ] ) .",
    "this result , in conjunction with ( [ a43 ] ) and ( [ a44 ] ) , yields the scaling exponent for @xmath180namely @xmath181 where @xmath182 we shall calculate @xmath183 in section [ section5 ] .",
    "consider now the general case for even orders @xmath184 introducing the general composite operator product @xmath185 and taking advantage of the isotropic symmetry , we can write the binomial expansion of ( [ a1 ] ) as @xmath186    we can identify the dominant term of the ope of @xmath187 by factoring out the product @xmath188 and using the fact that , by ( [ a44 ] ) , its expansion begins with the unit operator .",
    "we will justify this process in section [ section9 ] .",
    "this implies that the ope of @xmath189 itself takes the form @xmath190 where again the dots indicate subdominant terms.substituting ( [ a70 ] ) in ( [ a69 ] ) , we get @xmath191 the averages of the composite operators being independent of @xmath192 for homogeneous isotropic turbulence .    to find @xmath0 from this expansion , we have to determine which term or terms on the right hand side yield the negative correction of maximum magnitude to @xmath193 . as before",
    ", this is deduced from the rg equation for the wilson coefficient @xmath194 , which we derive next .",
    "we begin by inserting ( [ a68 ] ) into the general correlation function ( [ a45 ] ) to obtain the general inserted correlation function @xmath195 according to ( [ a49 ] ) its bare and renormalised forms are connected by the relation @xmath196 from which it follows that @xmath197 satisfies the rg equation @xmath198    next , we insert the expansion ( [ a70 ] ) into the general correlation function ( [ a45 ] ) , and use the definitions ( [ a47 ] ) and ( [ a73 ] ) , to get @xmath199 we then apply the rg operator ( [ a51 ] ) to the fourier transform of this equation , and substitute ( [ a54 ] ) and ( [ a75 ] ) to obtain @xmath200 from which it follows that @xmath201    we now invoke the standard solution of ( [ a78 ] ) , applicable at the _ uv _ fixed point [ 12 ] , to obtain the scaling relation @xmath202 where @xmath203 upon substituting ( [ a79 ] ) in ( [ a72 ] ) , it is immediately evident that the scaling exponent of @xmath16 is given by @xmath204 where @xmath205 once @xmath206 has been evaluated from ( [ a55 ] ) , at the fixed point , which we do in section [ section5 ] , it is a simple matter to evaluate @xmath207 , as we show in section [ section6 ] .",
    "odd orders with @xmath208 may be treated similarly with minor adjustments to allow for the fact that the expansions involve odd powers . in this case",
    ", however , it is immediately evident that the dominant scaling must arise from the wilson coefficient of the unit operator corresponding to @xmath209 because averaging wipes out other terms by virtue of the fact that @xmath210 hence , we obtain @xmath211 again , the justification of the relevant expansions is given in section [ section9 ] .",
    "in order to evaluate @xmath207 , we have to establish that an _ uv _ fixed point exists , which entails showing that the rg @xmath212 function ( [ a52 ] ) possesses a zero @xmath213 at which @xmath214 to do this we must first determine the dependence of the renormalisation constants @xmath96 and @xmath215on the renormalisation scale @xmath165 .",

    "hence , it yields a contribution to @xmath261 given by @xmath262 we can extract the logarithmic divergence from this integral by expanding its integrand in powers of @xmath263 .",

    "the logarithmic divergence is suppressed individually for each diagram , after integration over the solid angles . in the case of the three remaining 2-loop diagrams containing insertions of the 1-loop diagrams ( _ i ) _ and ( _ iv _ ) of fig.3 , suppression results after integrating over the solid angles and summing over the diagrams , the overall cancellation being related to the fact that the coefficients @xmath222 and @xmath274 associated with the two types of insertion are equal . likewise the four 1-loop diagrams containing the counterterm vertices yield no net contribution to @xmath223 .",
    "the treatment of the power and power@xmath25logarithmic divergences arising in integrals like ( [ a300]),([a301 ] ) and ( [ a302 ] ) is given in section [ section7 ] .",
    "for the moment we discard them because they are not directly relevant to the actual calculation of the scaling exponents for reasons already given .",
    "having established that an _ uv _ fixed point exists , we can proceed with the calculation of the anomalous dimension @xmath325of the general operator @xmath147 , which is required for the evaluation of the anomaly @xmath326to do this in the simplest possible way , we must identify a 1pi response function which can be renormalised by means of @xmath327 elimination of the logarithmic divergences from such a function will then enable us to determine the constants in the expansion @xmath328 so that we can calculate @xmath173 using ( [ a55 ] ) .",
    "consider first the case @xmath329 .",
    "obviously , the required function must involve @xmath146 , which is the composite operator associated with the longitudinal turbulence energy .",

    "the normalisation condition for @xmath349 is again applied at the point @xmath350 and chosen to be consistent with the tree level approximation , which gives @xmath351 so that the 1 and 2-loop terms satisfy the normalisation conditions @xmath352    the diagrams giving @xmath353 to 2-loop order are shown in fig.4 . their new feature is the appearance of the heavy dot vertex .",
    "this represents the @xmath354 composite operator vertex , which is shown in fig.1(_iv _ ) for the general case of @xmath174.we can understand how these diagrams arise from the loop expansion of @xmath228 by using the general procedure described in [ 15 ] .",

    "hence , the good agreement between our calculations at higher values of @xmath3 with the particular data sets from [ 16 - 18 ] must be treated with caution , particularly as the expression we have derived above is not applicable at large orders .",
    "this limitation stems from the fact that the mean nonlinear response function , being an average over the forcing configuration , does not represent the effect of multiple correlations with sufficient accuracy at large @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the approximation ( [ a172 ] ) , as we have noted , only holds up to 2-loop order .",
    "indeed , it is evident from the foregoing that the overall approximation must fail when @xmath411 .",

    "equally , the divergence of our theoretical values at higher values of @xmath3 from the other two data sets [ 19,20 ] could indicate that the accuracy of our low order approximation is already beginning to deteriorate at around @xmath413",
    "we now return to the question of the power and power@xmath25logarithmic divergences which , up to this point , we have simply discarded . the fact that power divergences arise when",
    "field - theoretic methods are applied to turbulence , using an eulerian approach , was noticed originally in [ 21 ] .",
    "their origin was subsequently identified as being due to the kinematic effect of the sweeping of small eddies by large eddies , having an almost uniform velocity [ 22,23 ] .",
    "the remedy was to change from an eulerian to a lagrangian description , but this greatly complicates the subsequent analysis [ 24 ] .",
    "however , it has been shown that the elimination of sweeping can be accomplished more simply by transforming to a frame moving with the local velocity of the large scale eddies at some chosen reference point , [ 25,26 ] .",
    "we shall show that a similar approach can be used to eliminate the power and power@xmath25logarithmic divergences within the present framework . in this way",
    ", we shall demonstrate that , although we have started out from an eulerian formulation , we ultimately obtain quasi - lagrangian approximations for the renormalised functions .    the problem , therefore , is to find a sweeping interaction term , @xmath414 , say , which can be used to eliminate the effect of sweeping convection . to this end",
    ", we introduce a uniform convection @xmath415 into @xmath24 and average over its probability distribution , which we assume to be a gaussian distribution @xmath416this adds to @xmath90 an additional interaction term given by @xmath417 which represents the effect of a random galilean transformation of the velocity field .",
    "we have not distinguished between @xmath56 before and after the transformation for consistency with the earlier expressions , such as ( [ a23 ] ) , and bearing in mind that the transformation does not affect the statistical averages required for the structure functions .    to represent diagrammatically the additional terms which arise in the loop expansion of @xmath24 after the inclusion of the sweeping interaction term we need to introduce a new 4-leg ` sweeping ' vertex of the type shown in fig.6(_i _ ) .",
    "the two wavevectors @xmath418 and @xmath324 in ( [ a200 ] ) enter this vertex along its continuous legs and leave along the dotted legs .",
    "a pair of legs carrying a particular wavevector must also carry the same vector index to represent the scalar product .",
    "free wavevectors in a diagram containing one or more of these sweeping vertices are identified , as previously , by overall wavenumber conservation , together with conservation at any ns vertex .",
    "each sweeping vertex then contributes a factor @xmath419 , where @xmath420 and @xmath244 are the two wavevectors which enter the vertex along its two continuous legs . in all other",
    "respects the diagrams are to be interpreted in accordance with the rules given in section [ section4 ] .",
    "consider now the set of diagrams , containing only ns vertices , which are associated with a particular green s function or velocity correlator , @xmath421 , say . let @xmath422 denote any such diagram contributing to @xmath423 .",
    "we shall show that it is possible to generate all power and power@xmath25logarithmic divergences of any @xmath422 from a single sweeping interaction of the form ( [ a200 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath424 denote any diagram containing at least one sweeping vertex .",
    "if @xmath424 contains no ns vertices at all , then it will only generate power divergences .",
    "but if it contains at least one ns vertex , it will also generate power@xmath25logarithmic divergences.the following topological argument demonstrates that the power divergences of @xmath422 can be put into 1 - 1 correspondence with the @xmath424 diagrams relating to @xmath425 .",
    "each factor @xmath426 ( or , equivalently , @xmath427 ) in a power divergence of @xmath422 arises because it is possible for a soft wavevector @xmath428 to flow through a particular velocity correlator without flowing through the active legs of the two ns vertices which it connects , as already discussed in section [ section4 ] .",
    "this situation can be represented diagrammatically by contracting the correlator into a 4-leg vertex formed by merging the two ns vertices which it links , whilst leaving the hard lines in tact .",
    "this can be demonstrated as follows .",
    "first , the new vertex must consist of two in - coming full lines which carry hard wavevectors , @xmath420 and @xmath244 ( say ) , and two outgoing dotted lines along which they leave.this is because two full legs disappear from the merged ns vertices and wavevectors leave ns vertices along the dotted leg . furthermore , after integrating over the directions of the soft wavevector @xmath429 , the two merged ns vertices generate , through contraction of the projectors , a factor proportional to the scalar product of the in - coming hard lines , @xmath430 , while the two legs of a pair carrying the same wavevector acquire the same vector index.the final integration over the wavenumbers then produces the constant @xmath431 so , such a vertex must , in fact , be of the sweeping convection type ( [ a200 ] ) , with a coefficient given by @xmath432 which relates the _ rms _ velocity of the sweeping eddies to the strength of the nonlinear interaction.note that @xmath433 is scale dependent , as it depends on the renormalisation scale @xmath165 through @xmath434 and @xmath100 , and , hence , it differs according to the fluctuation scale on which the rg focuses . in physical terms , this reflects the fact that the _ rms _ velocity of the sweeping eddies depends on the scale selected .",
    "clearly , if a subset of correlators of @xmath435 each of which carries a soft wavenumber , is contracted into such vertices , in a manner which allows hard wavevectors to flow through @xmath435 then the result is a diagram which is identical to one of the @xmath424 diagrams . moreover , it is clear that there are always exactly as many ways to contract the correlators in @xmath436 as there are different @xmath437diagrams and that their symmetry factors must match .",
    "this argument demonstrates , therefore , the important point that the power and power@xmath25logarithmic divergences generated by the ns vertex must arise on account of the background of kinematic sweeping effects .",
    "moreover , we also see that , in order to eliminate them , it is only necessary to introduce a sweeping interaction term into @xmath24 of opposite sign to the one from which they can be generated , which , according to ( [ a200 ] ) and ( [ a201 ] ) yields the sweeping interaction term @xmath438 thus , the sweeping vertex shown in fig.6(_i _ ) is taken to represent the algebraic factor @xmath439 having inserted ( [ a202 ] ) into @xmath24 one is then left with only the pure logarithmic divergences generated by the ns vertex , which , as we have shown , can be summed using the rg .",
    "this justifies our procedure whereby power  and power@xmath25logarithmic divergences are discarded when calculating anomalous exponents .",
    "we now illustrate the cancellation of power and power@xmath25logarithmic divergences in concrete terms by eliminating them to 2-loop order from @xmath440 this will demonstrate how the various symmetry factors match up .",
    "consider first the 1-loop diagram for @xmath441 arising from the ns vertex . from our previous result ( [ a203 ] )",
    ", we find that its power divergence is given , at the normalisation point , by @xmath442 here the feynman rules applied to the sweeping vertex yield the single diagram of fig.6(_ii _ ) , as we anticipate from the fact that the ns vertices in fig.3(_i _ ) can be merged in only one way . in this case , a trivial calculation yields @xmath443 which cancels ( [ a204 ] ) , as required .",
    "explicit verification that there are no power or power@xmath25logarithmic divergences in @xmath241 at 2-loop order is less trivial .",
    "consider first diagram ( _ iv _ * ) * of fig.3 .",
    "the power divergences arising from this diagram follow from ( [ a205 ] ) which gives @xmath444 for this diagram the corresponding sweeping diagrams are diagrams ( _ i_)-(_iii _ ) of fig.7 .",
    "this follows from the feynman rules and can be checked from diagram ( _ iv _ ) of fig.3 by first contracting its correlators individually and then together . by applying the feynman rules to diagram ( _ i _ ) of fig.7",
    "we obtain , at the normalisation point , @xmath445 we can evaluate this integral using the method described in section [ section4 ] .",
    "this gives @xmath446 diagram ( _ ii _ ) of fig.7 yields the same value @xmath447 finally , evaluation of the diagram ( _ iii _ ) of fig 7 is trivial and yields @xmath448 evidently , the sum of these three diagrams cancels ( [ a206 ] ) exactly .    similarly , we can show that the sweeping vertex eliminates the power divergences arising from the second 2-loop diagram , shown in fig.3(_iii _ ) . from ( [ a208 ] ) ,",
    "these are given by @xmath449 in this case , the corresponding diagrams generated by the sweeping vertex are diagrams ( _ iv)-(vi ) _ of fig.7 which contribute the terms @xmath450 @xmath451 and @xmath452 again , their sum exactly cancels ( [ a207 ] ) .",
    "we have thereby verified to 2-loop order that the sweeping interaction eliminates power divergences from the linear response function .",
    "the fact that it has been possible to calculate the anomalies successfully by means of perturbation theory stems , in part , from the incorporation of the kolmogorov theory into the zero order approximation .",
    "as we have seen , this has been done by replacing the actual viscous quadratic form in @xmath24 , arising from the ns equations , by a modified quadratic form , characterised by an effective random stirring force spectrum @xmath453 and the effective timescale @xmath454.we now demonstrate that these two functions can be deduced self - consistently as part of the calculation and confirm that that they do have the inertial range forms given in ( [ a184 ] ) and ( [ a185 ] ) .    to determine these functions , we need two conditions . as in [ 10 ] , one condition is supplied by evaluating the energy equation to 1-loop order , which gives the convergent dia form , corresponding to the so - called line renormalisation [ 24 ] . in the inertial range",
    ", it reduces to the condition that the energy flux across wavenumbers @xmath455 is independent of @xmath456 and equal to the mean dissipation rate @xmath457 : @xmath458 thus , evaluation of @xmath455 to 1-loop order gives the well - known result [ 24 ] @xmath459 where @xmath460 here @xmath461 indicates integration over the region of the @xmath462 plane in which @xmath463 can form a triangle and @xmath464    the second condition must be deduced from the linear response function.this is where difficulties have arisen with this approach in the past , when using an eulerian framework , because of the _ ir _ divergences arising from sweeping . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that no divergence problems arise from sweeping convection in the case of the energy equation [ 24 ] .",
    "however , we have just shown how these power divergences can be systematically removed from the response function ( and , indeed , all such functions ) by means of a random galilean transformation of the velocity field .",
    "this leaves the logarithmic divergences which , as we have seen , are to be eliminated from @xmath465 using the @xmath96 counterterm .",
    "recall that to fix the finite part of @xmath241 , after this renormalisation , we imposed the normalisation condition ( [ a210 ] ) which specifies that its tree level term should be exact at the normalisation scale @xmath165.thus , after eliminating sweeping convection , as described in section [ section7 ] , and using the 1-loop normalisation condition ( [ a210 ] ) to eliminate the logarithmic divergences , we obtain , at an arbitrary wavevector @xmath259 ( with @xmath466 ) , the renormalised linear response function @xmath467 it is precisely the condition that this expression should , indeed , yield a finite renormalised value which provides the required second relation , as we now explain .    in the inertial range limit ,",
    "we seek scaling solutions with @xmath468 and @xmath469 in which case @xmath470 now standard dimensional analysis shows that for ( [ a209 ] ) to hold in these circumstances , we must have @xmath471 [ 24 ] . furthermore ,",
    "if this scaling solution were to produce a non - renormalisable divergence in the response function , it would arise in the second term of ( [ a211 ] ) , since we can assume that @xmath472 to prevent this from occurring , the coefficient of the integral must be zero , which requires @xmath473 giving @xmath474 , and , hence , @xmath475 so that @xmath476thus , these relations do , in fact , yield the solution ( [ a184 ] ) and ( [ a185 ] ) , which we may conveniently re - write as @xmath477 and @xmath478 therefore , the energy spectrum function @xmath479 takes the kolmogorov inertial range form @xmath480 and the integral in the third term of ( [ a211 ] ) is , indeed , finite and yields @xmath481 for present purposes , explicit evaluation of the two constants is unnecessary , since they ultimately disappear from the calculation of the exponents , because they only occur through the coupling constant which , as we have seen , is eventually evaluated in terms of its fixed point value .    next , we comment briefly on the effect of allowing for the perturbation terms ( [ a182 ] ) which give the difference between the modified quadratic form and the original viscous form .",
    "as in [ 10 ] , we treat these terms as being of nominal order @xmath434 . their effect is , firstly , to re - introduce into @xmath465 the viscous timescale @xmath482 which was replaced by @xmath483 secondly , and more significantly , new divergences appear . however , it is not difficult to show that the divergent terms which are independent of @xmath73 and @xmath484 sum exactly to the amount cancelled by the counterterms , as would be expected . in the inertial range limit",
    "@xmath484 @xmath485 this leaves the term arising from @xmath486which is given by @xmath487 given that the actual stirring force spectrum function @xmath73 has remained arbitrary , subject only to the condition that it yields a finite input power given by @xmath488 it is clear that the above integral for @xmath489 must be finite .",
    "thus , the role of these perturbation terms is not critical as regards calculating the anomalous exponents , provided that the the spectrum of the stirring forces is non - zero only at small @xmath456 , as it should be .",
    "however , what we find is that , although forced at large scales , the above solution behaves in the inertial range as if the fluid were stirred with a force spectral function @xmath490 . in this context , it is interesting to note that , in a study of the randomly forced ns equations by a stochastic force with zero mean and variance @xmath490 [ 27 ] , evidence of multiscaling of the structure functions has been found . in particular ,",
    "the results obtained for the ratios @xmath491 with the @xmath492 spectrum have been shown to agree with the values computed from the ns equations forced at large scales .",
    "this , of course , is exactly what one might expect from the above approximation.the present results are also consistent with the numerical calculations in [ 28 ] , which suggest the scaling @xmath493 , as in ( [ a212 ] ) , for the lagrangian micro timescale , as opposed to the scaling @xmath494 for the eulerian micro timescale , evidence for which has also been presented in [ 29 ] . as we have seen",
    ", the reason why the lagrangian timescale applies in the present calculation is because we have eliminated sweeping by referring the velocity field to a frame moving with the local velocity of the large scale eddies which prevail at any chosen scale .",
    "this extracts the straining interactions , which shape the spectrum , from the background of convection , to yield quasi - lagrangian approximations .    in a sense , this derivation of the kolmogorov quadratic form is analogous to a multiple timescale expansion in nonlinear wave theory , where part of the nonlinear behaviour is incorporated into the linear approximation , eg via a slowly changing wave amplitude , the variation of which is then determined from the nonlinear interaction by requiring the absence of secular terms in the higher order approximation.here the requirement is similar in that it demands the absence of non - renormalisable terms in order to determine the nonlinear behaviour of the modified quadratic form .",
    "an integral part of the kolmogorov theory is the exact result that in the inertial range limit @xmath495 [ 5 ] .",
    "so we conclude this section by verifying that this result follows from the present treatment .    using standard symmetry relations",
    ", we can express @xmath496 in terms of the longitudinal component of the equal time triple velocity correlator @xmath497 giving @xmath498 now the general form of the fourier transform of @xmath499must be @xmath500 and so @xmath501 can be expressed in terms of the transfer spectrum @xmath502 by @xmath503 while @xmath502 is given to 1-loop order by ( [ a209 ] ) . substituting these results in ( [ a305 ] )",
    "gives @xmath504    this integral can be expanded in powers of @xmath14 the lowest order term giving @xmath505 after integrating over the solid angle , we get @xmath506 this latter integral is , of course , the transport power @xmath507 , which is a finite quantity at 1-loop order and equal to the mean dissipation rate , as indicated in above , and , hence , we recover ( [ a307 ] ) .",
    "the correlation function @xmath508 also has an important role in the derivation of the opes required for the structure functions with higher odd orders , as we shall see shortly .",
    "we give finally the derivation of the dominant terms of the opes which we have used in section [ section3 ] to obtain the structure function expansions .",
    "we deal first with the expansions required for the higher order structure functions with orders @xmath393 .",
    "these can be obtained using the technique described in [ 30 ] .",
    "we defer discussion of the particular case @xmath135 until last , because it requires a different approach for the reasons given in section [ section3 ] .",
    "we begin by considering the ope of the general product , defined in ( [ a68 ] ) , as it appears in  the expansion ( [ a69 ] ) for @xmath16 , taking first the case of even orders @xmath395 , with @xmath509 namely @xmath510 where , as previously , @xmath12 and we have used the definition ( [ a9 ] ) .",
    "let us consider the effect of inserting @xmath511 into a correlation function containing an arbitrary set of elementary fields @xmath512 as in ( [ a45 ] ) .",
    "then , following the approach of [ 30 ] , we can derive the dominant terms which we have used in section [ section3 ] by considering how many of the @xmath513 fields can be paired with a @xmath514 field to form products of lower order correlation functions .",
    "consider the case @xmath209 ie @xmath515 here each @xmath513 can be paired with a @xmath514 to yield a product term @xmath516 which corresponds to the presence of a unit operator term in the ope , [ 30 ] .",
    "if , instead , we only select @xmath517 pairs of @xmath140 products , we obtain a term of the type @xmath518 now , in the limit as @xmath141 , @xmath519 behaves like an insertion of @xmath146 into the correlation function of elementary fields [ 30 ] .",
    "hence , this product tends to @xmath520 but the averages of powers of @xmath521 simply yield non - stochastic functions of @xmath14 , which we shall denote generically by @xmath522 as appropriate .",
    "thus , from ( [ a308 ] ) and ( [ a309 ] ) , we obtain , in the limit as @xmath141 , @xmath523 \\right\\rangle .\\ ] ] since the elementary fields are arbitrary , it follows that we have an ope of the form @xmath524 the point about expansions of this type is that the operators of increasing complexity do , indeed , produce subdominant terms in the expansion of @xmath525 here , for example , the unit operator term , as we have shown , produces the dominant scaling with anomalous exponent given by ( [ a310 ] ) , whereas the quadratic term can be readily shown to give the smaller exponent @xmath526\\delta _ { 2},$ ] and , hence , is subdominant , while further terms in the expansion would produce even greater reductions .",
    "a similar argument applies when @xmath527 in this case , however , we can not pair every @xmath513 with a @xmath528 therefore , the unit operator term can not appear in the ope for @xmath529 if , however , we pair every @xmath530 with a @xmath513 then the remaining @xmath531 pairs with the elementary fields and , in the limit as @xmath141 , again appears as an @xmath146 insertion . in this case , therefore , the ope starts with @xmath532 to give @xmath533 by continuing with this argument , we see that the dominant term of the ope for the general case of @xmath187 must take the form given in ( [ a70 ] ) .",
    "consider next odd orders , @xmath534 .",
    "when @xmath398 , we have a term of the form @xmath535 which , again , corresponds to the presence of a unit operator term , which is , thus , the dominant term of the ope , giving @xmath536 when @xmath537 by pairing each @xmath514 with a @xmath538 we obtain a term of the form @xmath539 in the limit as @xmath141 , @xmath540 appears as an insertion of the cubic operator @xmath541 so that here the ope takes the form @xmath542 continuing this process , we get for the next ope @xmath543 and so on .",
    "but , in fact , the only term which contributes to @xmath16 for odd @xmath3 is the unit operator term of @xmath544 because @xmath545 for any integer @xmath380 , in the case of homogeneous isotropic turbulence .    in the particular case of @xmath140 , we can establish the form of its ope by using an expansion in the fourier domain , in which the wavenumber @xmath323 , corresponding to the separation @xmath14 , tends to infinity , as described for instance , in [ 7,8 ] .",
    "to this end , we start by considering the general correlation function @xmath546 for the case in which @xmath331 and @xmath332 tend to a common point @xmath547 well separated from @xmath548 and @xmath549 . for simplicity of presentation here , we have included only two arbitrary fields @xmath550 and @xmath551denote its fourier transform by @xmath552 then , in terms of the reduced correlation function , we can write @xmath553    when the arguments in ( [ a312 ] ) coalesce to the common point @xmath192 , we obtain the correlation function @xmath554 with fourier transform @xmath555 thus , corresponding to ( [ a311 ] ) , we have @xmath556    let @xmath557 and @xmath558 be the 1pi functions associated with the connected parts of @xmath559 and @xmath560 . denoting the connected part by superscript @xmath561 , we have , as in section [ section5 ] , @xmath562 and @xmath563    according to the standard procedure [ 7,8 ] , the behaviour of the correlation function @xmath564 as a function of @xmath565 , when @xmath331 and @xmath566 both tend to a common value @xmath192 , can be deduced from the behaviour of @xmath567 , in the limit as @xmath568 , which is , indeed , apparent from ( [ a311 ] ) and ( [ a313 ] ) .",
    "now , the diagrams which contribute to this 1pi correlation function are diagram ( _ i _ ) of fig.8 , together with its permutation @xmath569 , and diagram ( _ ii _ ) .",
    "however , it is easy to see from these diagrams that , as @xmath568 , diagram ( _ ii _ ) yields a contribution which is smaller than that from diagram ( _ i _ ) by a factor @xmath570 so to derive the dominant term , we need to focus on diagram ( _ i _ ) and its permutation .",
    "the corresponding diagrams for @xmath571 are diagram ( _ iii _ ) of fig.8 plus its permutation @xmath572    evaluation of these diagrams using the feynman rules is straightforward and yields @xmath573 and @xmath574 hence , for large @xmath575 we obtain from the last two equations the relation @xmath576 combining this with ( [ a313 ] ) and ( [ a314 ] ) yields the approximation @xmath577 where , to this order , @xmath578    to obtain the required expansion for @xmath140 , we must take the inverse fourier transform of ( [ a315 ] ) for the particular case @xmath579 with @xmath580 the coefficient",
    "@xmath581 then depends only upon @xmath14 and , according to ( [ a316 ] ) , it must have the form @xmath582 where @xmath583 is a function only of the wavenumber @xmath323 .",
    "it is clear from this integral that @xmath584 must be diagonal in the indices @xmath585 , and have equal transverse components:@xmath586    we now define @xmath587 to be the connected correlation function formed from the elementary fields @xmath588 and @xmath589 , with the insertion of the longitudinal energy operator @xmath146 , ie it is the particular case of ( [ a47 ] ) with @xmath329 and @xmath590 .",
    "then @xmath591 similarly , we define @xmath592 to be the correlation function with @xmath550 and @xmath589 , and the insertion of the transverse energy operator @xmath593 thus , we have @xmath594 finally , we define longitudinal and transverse coefficients by writing @xmath595 and @xmath596 using these definitions , and taking into account the diagonality of @xmath597 enables us to express the inverse fourier transform of ( [ a315 ] ) , for the case @xmath579 , as @xmath598 which , in the limit as @xmath141 , leads to @xmath599 \\right\\rangle .\\ ] ] since the fields @xmath550 and @xmath589 are arbitrary , we may conclude that @xmath600 note that we have discarded the transverse operator because it is subdominant .",
    "this follows immediately from the analysis of section [ section5 ] . for example , in the case of @xmath601 when we calculate the corresponding value of the constant @xmath602 as defined in ( [ a139 ] ) , we get twice the value given in ( [ a160 ] ) for the longitudinal operator @xmath603 because , by isotropy , each of the two transverse components of @xmath604 contributes an amount equal to the value obtained for @xmath146 and , hence , the right hand side of ( [ a174 ] ) then yields an anomalous exponent of @xmath605 , indicating that @xmath604 makes a subdominant contribution to @xmath606 .",
    "thus , we have shown , to within the order @xmath142 of the calculation , that the dominant term of the ope for @xmath140 has the form given in ( [ a44 ] ) .",
    "the fact that it has been possible to demonstrate multiscaling and calculate anomalous exponents successfully from the generating functional by means of perturbation theory , notwithstanding the strong nonlinearity of the ns equations , is attributable to several factors.these include : ( 1 ) the use of a modified quadratic form , which is derived self - consistently from the ns nonlinearity;(2 ) the incorporation in the generating functional of the composite operators which appear in the definition of the general structure function;(3 ) the application of opes to derive corrections to the kolmogorov exponents in terms of the anomalous dimensions of these operators;(4 ) the identification of a class of irreducible green s functions containing insertions of these operators , which facilitate the calculation of their anomalous dimensions;(5 ) the elimination of sweeping convection effects using a random galilean transformation of the velocity field ; and , finally , ( 6 ) the deduction of the inertial range scaling using an _ uv _ fixed point of the rg to achieve the required small wavenumber limit .",
    "let us now consider how each of these factors contributes to overcoming the obstacles encountered in previous applications of the rg .",
    "the use of the modified quadratic form is an important element in the success of our calculation , because it provides an accurate initial approximation , which yields the kolmogorov distribution in the inertial range limit .",
    "by contrast , in the early work which employed a field theoretic rg [ 31 ] , and in subsequent developments of it [ 32 - 34 ] , including equivalent formulations based on [ 35 ] , reviewed recently in [ 36 ] , the zero order approximation is based solely on on the linear terms of the ns equations , as in a conventional field theory calculation .",
    "because this is a poor approximation for turbulence , it does not result in a genuine weak expansion parameter .",
    "for example , in the previous applications of rg techniques based on an expansion in the force spectrum exponent ( ie the @xmath457-expansion ) , in which the expansion about @xmath607 is extrapolated to @xmath608 the value of the coupling constant is not small , at the _ ir _ fixed point which is used .",
    "therefore , the accuracy of the expansion is uncontrolled . indeed , according to[37 ] , it may even be uncontrolled when @xmath609 , and there are problems in establishing its radius of convergence and the value of @xmath457 at which long range driving becomes technically irrelevant [ 38 ] .",
    "however , our expansion is of a different nature .",
    "first , we do not use an @xmath610-expansion .",
    "actually , there is no force power spectrum in our calculation as such.as we showed , the force spectrum @xmath73 remains in the calculation as an arbitrary function , subject only to the requirment that it yields a finite input power .",
    "what the modified quadratic form provides , however , is an apparent force power spectrum @xmath453 , but its exponent is fixed by the solution ( [ a213 ] ) , and , thus , can not be varied .",
    "second , we do not use an _ ir _ fixed point , because we are interested in taking the short wavelength limit , for which purpose we require an _ uv _ fixed point.together , these differences result in a genuinely small coupling constant @xmath434 , which is about 1/20 at the fixed point , as shown in section [ section4 ] .",
    "hence , our expansion is inherently more accurate than the @xmath610-expansion .",
    "in fact , given that our calculation is carried out to 2-loop order , its errors are controlled at @xmath611 another significant consequence of using the modified quadratic form is that no convergence problems are encountered in the _ uv _ region .",
    "this , together with the fact that we do not use an @xmath457-expansion or an _ ir _ fixed point , means that none of the ingredients which cause marginality by power counting in previous applications of the rg [ 37 ] , are present in our approach .    on the other hand",
    ", there is a similar problem to be faced in the present calculation.any fully renormalised theory of turbulence must contain an infinite number of renormalised functions because it must be equivalent to the hierarchy of equations for the cumulants.this equivalence has been demonstrated recently [ 39 ] .",
    "in fact , each cumulant will have a representation as a expansion in terms of irreducible renormalised functions .",
    "thus , one has an infinite set of vertex functions to contend with .",
    "now , when any one of these irreducible functions is calculated in perturbation theory using the modified quadratic form , the overall logarithmic divergence will remain , after sweeping divergences have been eliminated .",
    "so the problem in the present approach amounts to the resummation of these logarithms .",
    "however , we showed in section [ section5 ] that this difficulty could be overcome , in relation to multiscaling , by identifying the infinite sub - class of functions which yields the desired information relating to anomalous exponents while being , at the same time , amenable to resummation using the rg.the irreducible inserted nonlinear green s functions defined in section [ section5 ] satisfy both requirements .",
    "being fully irreducible they give full @xmath3-point correlations.however , as we have seen , to render them tractable , it was expedient to obtain a mean response to forcing at the centroid of the excitation points .",
    "this averaging thus constitutes a closure approximation .",
    "although this type of closure approximation permits considerable progress to be made with the calculation of the exponents , the averaging process limits its applicability to relatively low orders , @xmath612 , because the multiple correlations between the apparent forcing at different space - time points are not then approximated accurately enough at higher orders .",
    "thus , a different approximation would be required to obtain the asymptotic scaling at large orders and it remains for future work to discover a suitable approach .      1 .",

    "<S> the corrections to the kolmogorov exponents are expressed in terms of the anomalous dimensions of the composite operators which occur in the definition of @xmath1 .  </S>",
    "<S> these are calculated from the anomalous scaling of the appropriate class of nonlinear green s function , using an @xmath2 fixed point of the renormalisation group , which thereby establishes the connection with the dynamics of the turbulence .  </S>",
    "<S> the main result is an algebraic expression for @xmath0 , which contains no adjustable constants .  </S>",
    "<S> it is valid at orders @xmath3 below @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the fixed point coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> this expression is used to calculate @xmath0 for orders in the range @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and the results are shown to be in good agreement with experimental data , key examples being @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    </S>",
