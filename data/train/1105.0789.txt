    "instability of dark solitons with respect to transverse perturbations is well studied both theoretically and experimentally ( see , e.g. , review articles @xcite and references therein ) . qualitatively , it is caused by decrease of the energy per unit length of a soliton with increase of the local velocity of the disturbed element . as a result ,",
    "the stretched segments of the soliton acquire increased velocity and hence the soliton s local curvature grows with time which leads to breaking of the soliton followed by formation of vortex pairs .",
    "however , this mechanism of the dark soliton instability was studied mainly when the dark soliton propagates in a quiescent medium .",
    "for example , this situation is realized in dynamics of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , when dark solitons are formed by means of density or phase engineering .",
    "however , the situation can change drastically , if there is fast enough flow of the condensate along the dark soliton .",
    "in particular , as was found in @xcite , just this happens when dark solitons are generated by a flow of bec past an obstacle . in this case dynamics of bec is described ( in standard non - dimensional units ) by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the condensate wave function and @xmath2 the potential of the obstacle .",
    "this equation was solved numerically in @xcite with the boundary condition @xmath3 at the boundary @xmath4 far enough from the obstacle , and it was found that there is a critical value of the mach number of the incident flow , @xmath5 so that for @xmath6 the vortices are generated downstream the obstacle whereas for @xmath7 the dark solitons are stretched from the shadow behind the obstacle .",
    "this difference in the flow behavior was explained in @xcite as a transition from absolute instability of dark solitons to their convective instability , so that for @xmath7 the unstable disturbances of the dark soliton are convected by the flow along it with such a velocity that they can not destroy the soliton at any finite distance from the obstacle after long enough time and , hence , the soliton increases its length with time . in this letter",
    "we shall introduce the notion of velocity of propagation of the front of the unstable wave packet into undisturbed region of the dark soliton .",
    "this will permit us to give simple physical interpretation of the condition for the absolute / convective instability transition found in @xcite and to determine quantitatively the growth rate of oblique solitons length in the experiments with flow of condensate past an obstacle what is quite topical in connection with recent experimental observation @xcite of oblique solitons in the flow of the polariton condensate .",
    "to simplify the notation , equation ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) is written in such units that the background uniform density is equal to unity and unit of velocity is equal to the sound speed ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "let the dark soliton propagate along @xmath9 axis with velocity @xmath10 , then the corresponding dark soliton solution of ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) ( with @xmath11 ) has the form @xmath12 + iv.\\ ] ] if we represent the condensate wave function as @xmath13 then the condensate density and the flow velocity , @xmath14 are given for the soliton solution by the formulae @xmath15 } \\\\ & u = \\frac{{\\partial}\\phi}{{\\partial}x } = v \\left ( 1-\\frac{1}{n } \\right ) , \\quad v = \\frac{{\\partial}\\phi}{{\\partial}y } = 0 .",

    "the disturbed soliton solution can be written as @xmath16 where in the linear approximation the real variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 are related with perturbations of the density @xmath19 and the phase @xmath20 by the formulae @xmath21 substitution of ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) into ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) with @xmath22 and linearizing of the resulting equation with respect to @xmath23 give @xmath24 where asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",
    "let the disturbance be represented by a harmonic wave propagating along the soliton : @xmath25 $ ] or @xmath26 , \\phi=(\\phi'-i\\phi'')\\propto\\exp[i ( py-\\omega ( p ) t)]$ ] .",
    "for this harmonic form of the disturbance , equation ( [ 2 - 7 ] ) reduces to @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "substitution of ( [ 2 - 4 ] ) and separation of real and imaginary parts yields the eigenvalue problem for @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 it can be solved numerically for any given value of the soliton s velocity @xmath10 . as was found in @xcite , the spectrum consist of two parts  unstable ( @xmath32 ) for @xmath33 and stable ( @xmath34 ) for @xmath35 , where @xmath36^{1/2}.\\ ] ]     ( red ) and dispersion law of harmonic stable modes for @xmath37 ( green ) as functions of the wave number @xmath38 of perturbation .",
    "soliton s velocity is equal to @xmath39 and @xmath40 . , width=302,height=226 ]    [ fig1 ]    typical plots for @xmath41 and @xmath42 are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "non - zero values of @xmath43 for @xmath33 mean instability of dark solitons .",
    "the dispersive curve @xmath42 for @xmath44 has an inflection point @xmath45 at which @xmath46 the found in @xcite criterium of transition from absolute to convective instability of oblique solitons can be written in the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the component of the flow velocity along the soliton , @xmath49 being the angle between the direction of the incident flow ( @xmath9 axis ) and the oblique soliton , and the soliton s velocity @xmath10 is equal to @xmath50 hence the dispersion law @xmath51 depends on @xmath52 and ( [ 2 - 13 ] ) is actually the equation for @xmath52 as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "this equation was solved numerically in @xcite and in the limit of small @xmath49 ( deep solitons ) the solution tends to the value ( [ 1 - 3 ] ) from below .",
    "equations ( [ 2 - 12 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 13 ] ) can be interpreted in general case , when the soliton s velocity @xmath53 and the flow velocity @xmath54 along it are independent parameters , as the statement that the front of the disturbance which breaks the dark soliton with formation of vortices propagates into undisturbed region with velocity equal to the minimal group velocity @xmath55 if @xmath56 , then this wave packet is convected away by the flow from a region around any fixed value of the coordinate along the soliton and the instability is convective ; if @xmath57 , then the wave packet evolves into nonlinear stage with breaking of the soliton into vortices at any fixed location along the soliton and the instability is absolute .",
    "this formulation can be supported by the following reasoning . at the edges of the disturbance",
    "its amplitude is small and hence it can be described by the linear theory . therefore we represent evolution of a disturbance as @xmath58 for large time @xmath59 the integral can be evaluated by the steepest descent method so that the main contribution to it is given by vicinity of the saddle points @xmath60 defined as solutions of the equation @xmath61 the values of @xmath60 depend on @xmath62 and we suppose that for large enough @xmath63 equation ( [ 2 - 19 ] ) yields two real solutions .",
    "then the integral function includes the fast oscillating factor @xmath64 and the resulting integral corresponds to a usual dispersive wave packet slowly decaying with time as @xmath65 .",
    "however , if with decreasing of @xmath63 the roots of eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 19 ] ) move along the real @xmath38-axis and collide with each other at some value of @xmath66 bifurcating here into two complex roots @xmath60 and @xmath67 , then the saddle points move into complex plane and the integral ( [ 2 - 18 ] ) includes the factor @xmath68 $ ] exponentially depending on @xmath63 .",
    "hence , @xmath66 corresponds to the edge of a large amplitude pulse . at the point of transition of two real roots into two complex ones the equation ( [ 2 - 19 ] ) has a double root , that is here we have @xmath69 which means that the edge of the pulse corresponds to the extremum of the group velocity .",
    "just this situation occurs in the case of the dispersion law @xmath70 of disturbances propagating along a dark soliton , as one can see in fig .  1 , where @xmath71 corresponds to the minimum ( [ 2 - 16 ] ) of the group velocity .",
    "it is instructive to illustrate the above consideration by the example of shallow dark solitons which evolution is described by the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation @xcite and the dispersion law of disturbances was found in explicit form by v.  e.  zakharov in @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 . from eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 19 ] ) we find the solution for the saddle point @xmath74\\ ] ] which is complex for @xmath75 .",
    "thus , here the disturbance has the amplitude proportional to @xmath76.\\ ] ] its edge points propagate with velocities @xmath77 equal ( in absolute value ) to the minimum of the group velocity at @xmath78 , @xmath79 corresponding to the dispersion law ( [ 2 - 21 ] )",
    ".     starts its motion at @xmath80 with velocity @xmath39 .",
    "the edges of a disturbed region expand with velocities equal to @xmath81 .",
    ", width=302,height=302 ]    [ fig2 ]    thus , we can say that for large enough time the edges of the disturbance of a dark soliton propagate into its undisturbed parts with the universal velocity @xmath82 determined by the parameters of the soliton rather than the initial form of the disturbance .",
    "we have checked this conclusion by numerical solution of the gp equation ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) with the initial condition in the form of the dark soliton ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) slightly disturbed at point @xmath83 .",
    "two stages of evolution are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "although the disturbed region evolves fast into the nonlinear stage with formation of vortices , its edge points propagate with velocity @xmath84 , which agrees quite well with the critical velocity @xmath85 calculated according to the linear theory by eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 16 ] ) .",
    ", the obstacle potential was turned on gradually during fist 20 units of time .",
    "the mach number of the flow is equal to @xmath86 and the oblique solitons correspond to the normal component of the flow velocity @xmath87 equal to velocity of the soliton shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the length of the oblique solitons grows up with the rate @xmath88 in agreement with the analytical prediction @xmath89 calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 26 ] ) . , width=377,height=302 ]    [ fig3 ]    as was predicted theoretically in @xcite for atomic condensate and was confirmed experimentally in @xcite for polariton condensate , a supersonic flow of condensate past an obstacle with size about one healing length generates a pair of oblique solitons behind the obstacle provided the incident flow has large enough mach number @xmath7 ( see ( [ 1 - 3 ] ) ) .",
    "if the size of the obstacle is increased , then two symmetrically situated fans of dark solitons are generated @xcite .",
    "after switching on the flow velocity ( or after the obstacle is put into motion ) , the length @xmath90 of oblique solitons increases with time linearly and , under supposition that the edge of the soliton can be considered as the edge of the disturbance propagating into the undisturbed region , the above theory leads to the conclusion that @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a projection of the flow velocity on the dark soliton direction ( hence the soliton velocity @xmath10 is canceled by the normal component @xmath93 of the flow velocity and the oblique soliton is a stationary object in the laboratory frame of reference ) . the velocity @xmath82 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 16 ] ) and represents the edge velocity of the disturbance which destroys the soliton into vortices . for @xmath56",
    "this disturbance is convected away from the obstacle and the oblique soliton increases its length @xmath90 with the constant rate ( [ 2 - 26 ] ) .",
    "we have checked this prediction by numerical simulations similar to ones performed in @xcite but for longer time .",
    "several stages of evolution are shown in fig .",
    "3 . as we found ,",
    "the oblique solitons do not stop their growth even after long time of evolution in agrement with the theory @xcite and the growth rate agrees very well with the analytical prediction ( [ 2 - 26 ] ) . in the case of the chosen parameters we have @xmath87 , the component of the flow velocity along the oblique soliton is equal to @xmath94 , and after subtraction of the minimal group velocity @xmath85",
    "corresponding to @xmath40 we get @xmath89 practically coinciding with the numerical estimate @xmath88 obtained by fitting to the results extracted from fig .  3 .",
    "in this letter we relate the critical velocity of transition from absolute instability of dark solitons to their convective instability with the velocity of expansion of an unstable wave packet into undisturbed region .",
    "a simple estimate shows that the expansion velocity is equal to the minimal value of the group velocity of perturbations propagating along the soliton .",
    "this interpretation of the absolute / convective instability transition is physically clear and leads to experimentally verifiable predictions .",
    "in particular , the growth rate of the length of oblique solitons generated by the flow of bec past small obstacles can be easily calculated .",
    "the developed theory can also be applied to description of stability of oblique solitons generated by the flow past extended obstacles .",
    "for example , as was observed in @xcite , oblique dispersive shocks generated by the flow of bec past a concave corner start to decay at some moment of time with formation of a cloud of vortices .",
    "the character of this instability depends on the projection of the flow velocity on the inclined side of the corner : if it is greater than the minimal group velocity of perturbations , then the instability is absolute and the dispersive shock wave will eventually be completely destroyed ; otherwise the instability is convective and the cloud of vortices is convected away by the flow of bec as long as this cloud does not interact with the boundary of the corner and , as a result of this interaction , the convective flow along the corner is not destroyed ."
