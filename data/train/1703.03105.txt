    "stability is an important criterion for consistency of kaluza - klein vacua . due to non - trivial topologies of their internal spaces",
    ", the standard positive energy theorem @xcite does not necessarily apply .",
    "in fact , it was shown by e.  witten @xcite that the original kaluza - klein theory @xcite on a product of the four - dimensional minkowski spacetime and a circle is unstable against a semi - classical decay process , unless protected by boundary conditions on fermions .",
    "the instanton that mediates the decay is the analytical continuation of five - dimensional schwarzschild solution , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is metrics on the unit three - shpere , and @xmath8 is the coordinate on the kaluza - klein circle .",
    "smoothness of the solution at @xmath9 requires @xmath8 to be periodic with period @xmath10 , and the kaluza - klein radius at @xmath11 is @xmath12 .",
    "as we move toward small @xmath13 , the circle collapses and becomes zero size at @xmath9 , where the geometry terminates .",
    "another analytic continuation of the polar angle on the three - sphere turns this into a lorentzian signature solution , where the `` bubble of nothing '' expands with velocity that asymptotes to the speed of light .",
    "witten s instanton has also played a role in stability of anti - de sitter ( ads ) vacua .",
    "there have been several proposals for non - supersymmetric ads geometries . among them",
    "is ads@xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a discrete subgroup of the @xmath16 rotational symmetry of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry is completely broken if @xmath15 does not fit within an @xmath18 subgroup of the @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "it turns out that , if @xmath15 has a fixed point on @xmath17 or if the radius of @xmath17 is not large enough , the perturbative spectrum on ads@xmath0 contains closed string tachyons that violate the breitenloner - freedman bound @xcite .",
    "when @xmath15 has no fixed point and @xmath17 is sufficiently large , the instability modes are lifted and the configuration becomes perturbatively stable . however , in this case , @xmath19 is not simply connected , and there is a witten - type instanton where a homotopically non - trivial cycle on @xmath19 collapses to zero size at a bubble of nothing  @xcite .",
    "this eliminates ads@xmath14 as a candidate for a stable non - supersymmetric ads geometry .    in this paper , we present instanton solutions where a higher - dimensional sphere rather than a circle collapses , in a low energy effective theory of m theory",
    ". such generalizations of witten s instanton were attempted earlier , for example in @xcite , where it was found that fluxes needed to cancel the intrinsic curvature on the sphere prevent it from collapsing .",
    "motivated by the recent conjecture @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that any non - supersymmetric ads vacuum supported by fluxes must be unstable , we found examples in non - supersymmetric setups which avoid the difficulty in the earlier attempt .",
    "we will focus on ads@xmath0 times positive khler - einstein spaces , which break supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "ads@xmath20 is the only example of this type known to be stable against linearized supergravity perturbations@xcite . since its internal space",
    "is simply connected , we do not expect it to have a witten - type instanton , where an @xmath21 collapses to zero size at a bubble .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath22 can be realized as @xmath23 fibration over @xmath24 , and it is possible for its @xmath23 fibers to collapse .",
    "indeed , we find such instanton solution with finite action .",
    "our solution avoids the difficulty with fluxes encountered in @xcite as follows .",
    "the ads@xmath0 geometry in question is supported by the 4-form flux in m theory , with non - zero components both on the @xmath23 fibers and on the @xmath24 base of the internal space . as we move toward the center of ads@xmath0 , the 4-form flux re - orient itself . by the time we reach the bubble of nothing",
    ", the flux has no components in the @xmath23 fiber direction .",
    "thus , the @xmath23 can collapse at the bubble without violating the flux conservation .",
    "ads@xmath20 is only marginally stable with normalizable mode at the breitenlohner - freedman bound .",
    "thus , this vacuum is also in danger of becoming unstable by higher derivative corrections to the eleven - dimensional supergravity . it is interesting to point out that in our instanton solution the normalizable mode at the breitenlohner - freedman bound is turned on and is responsible for triggering the collapse of the @xmath23 fiber .    if there is a `` bubble of nothing '' instanton in ads , it causes an instability that can be detected instantaneously on the boundary of ads @xcite .",
    "this is because any observer in ads can receive signals from any point on a cauchy surface within a finite amount of time , and an observer at the boundary in particular has access to an infinite volume space near the boundary within an infinitesimal amount of time .",
    "therefore , our new instanton solution in the perturbatively stable non - supersymmetric ads@xmath0 configuration offer further evidences for the conjecture of @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ ads cp ] we describe the ads@xmath25 solution and introduce our instanton ansatz .",
    "boundary conditions on the instanton at the bubble and at the infinity are discussed in section  [ sec asym ] .",
    "it turns out that there are algebraic relations among variables in our ansatz , as shown in section  [ anal rel ] .",
    "these relations reduce the problem to a second order ordinary differential equation on a single function , which we will numerically solve in section  [ num sol ] .",
    "finiteness of the instanton action is verified in section  [ inst action ] . in section  [ cp1 cp2 inst",
    "] , we discuss ads@xmath26",
    ". it is not know whether this geometry is stable against linearized supergravity perturbation .",
    "regardless , we will show that it allows a bubble of nothing solution and is therefore unstable non - perturbatively . in the final section ,",
    "we discuss additional features of our instanton solutions .",
    "for any khler - einstein sixfold @xmath28 , there exists an ads@xmath29 solution @xcite to the eleven - dimensional supergravity equations of motion , @xmath30 such a solution can be found by setting the 4-form field strength as , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the khler 2-form of internal space and @xmath33 is some constant , which will be related to the ads radius . with this ansatz , the right - hand side of the second equation in ( [ sugra eq ] ) vanishes since @xmath34 is nonzero only on @xmath28 , and the left - hand side vanishes by the khler integrability condition on @xmath32 . on the other hand , the first equation in ( [ sugra eq ] ) gives , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is index in the non - compact directions and @xmath37 are on @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the non - compact directions can be chosen to be ads@xmath0 , and @xmath28 must be an einstein manifold .",
    "the configuration breaks supersymmetry @xcite since there are no non - trivial solutions to @xmath38 for supersymmetry variation of the gravitini , @xmath39 as we mentioned in the introduction , the only known perturbatively stable case is @xmath40 .",
    "this space can be realized as @xmath23 fibration , and we look for instanton solution where the fiber collapses . in the next few sections we focus on @xmath40 and in section [ cp1 cp2 inst ] we show that instanton solution for @xmath41 can be constructed similarly .    to make the @xmath23 fibration explicit , we use the following set of coordinates on @xmath22 @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 here the first 4 tetrad corresponds to the base @xmath24 and the last two correspond to the @xmath23 fiber .",
    "we multiplied them by the functions @xmath44 , @xmath45 to make their sizes dynamical .",
    "we take the vierbein on euclidean ads space to be , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is any tetrad on the @xmath24 .",
    "the metric in this frame is , @xmath48 we used the freedom of coordinate redefinition by fixing the coefficient near @xmath49 to be 1 .",
    "the next step is to write an ansatz for the 4-from field , utilizing the @xmath18-structure of the squashed @xmath22 given by 2-form @xmath50 and 3-form @xmath51 as @xcite , @xmath52 here @xmath53 e.t.c .. these forms satisfy , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is external derivative of @xmath22 , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are torsion classes of the @xmath18-structure given by , @xmath58 a general manifold with @xmath18 structure has more terms in the relations  ( [ su3 str ] ) , but in the case of our interest ( squashed @xmath22 ) other torsion classes vanish .",
    "note , that this @xmath18-structure is different from the usual fubini - study khler structure of @xmath22 .",
    "we use @xmath32 to denote the fubini - study khler 2-from to distinguish it from @xmath50 .",
    "these two @xmath18-structures are associated to different realizations of @xmath22 as coset spaces .",
    "the first is @xmath59 , which is a symmetric space and the complex structure of @xmath16 gives the fubini - study structure .",
    "the second is @xmath60 , which is not manifestly symmetric but homogeneous .",
    "therefore , we can use the latter even after we change the relative sizes of the base @xmath24 and the fiber @xmath23 .",
    "this is the reason why we use the second structure to build an ansatz for the 4-form field .",
    "left - invariant 2-forms and 3-forms are spanned by @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "therefore , the most general ansatz for the 4-form respecting the symmetries is @xmath63    with the ansatz for the metric ( [ metrics ] ) and the 4-form field strength ( [ fourforms ] ) , we are ready to impose the eleven - dimensional supergravity equations of motion ( [ sugra eq ] )",
    ". the second equation in ( [ sugra eq ] ) , namely the maxwell equation for the 4-form , can be solved by , @xmath64 where the function @xmath65 satisfies the differential equation , @xmath66 from now on , we will set the dimensionful constant in ( [ f ansatz ] ) to be @xmath67 . in order for the 4-form ( [ fourforms ] ) coverge to ( [ f ansatz ] ) as @xmath68",
    ", one must impose @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the 4-form can be expressed as , @xmath72    the next step is to express the first equation in ( [ sugra eq ] ) , namely the einstein equations , in our ansatz as , @xmath73 for our reference below , we added the maxwell equation equation for the 4-form ( [ xi eq ] ) in the end .",
    "there are four independent functions , four einstein equations and one maxwell equation . due to the bianchi identities , only three out of four einstein equations are independent .    as a consistency check",
    ", we can easily verify that the euclidian version of ads@xmath25 , @xmath74 solves these equations .",
    "there is another simple solution , @xmath75 which is a stretched @xmath22 solution @xcite .",
    "one can see that @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath22 is stretched along its fiber .",
    "in this section , we will study boundary conditions to instanton solutions at the infinity of ads and at the bubble of nothing .    for @xmath68 , the solution should approach the vacuum ads@xmath20 , and we can linearlize  ( [ ein eq ] ) . in this set of equations ,",
    "three are second order differential equations for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and one is first order for @xmath81 ( modulo the redundancy by the bianchi identities ) .",
    "we should also note that there is translational invariance in @xmath13 , which is the residual symmetry in our gauge  ( [ metrics ] ) .",
    "therefore , there are six linearly independent modes , and they are @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . among them , three are normalizable and three are non - normalizable . note that @xmath84 and @xmath85 are at the breitenlohner - freedman bound .",
    "conformal invariance on the boundary requires the @xmath85 mode to vanish @xcite .",
    "this condition also guarantees that the instanton action is finite , as we will see in section [ inst action ] . for",
    "now , we only set the two diverging modes , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , to vanish at @xmath11",
    ". we will keep the @xmath85 mode to be adjustable in the next couple of sections and demand it to vanish in section [ inst action ] .",
    "let us turn our attention to boundary conditions at the bubble of nothing .",
    "in order for the @xmath23 fiber to shrink to zero size , the 4-form flux should not have components on the @xmath23 , otherwise the flux conservation would prevent it from collapsing",
    ". thus , @xmath65 in ( [ f4 ] ) must be chosen in such a way that @xmath88 is proportional to the volume form of the base @xmath24 .",
    "for this purpose , it is convenient to rewrite ( [ f4 ] ) as , @xmath89 note that the second and third terms in the right - hand side have @xmath45 and @xmath90 in the denominators , which should vanish at the bubble .",
    "however , @xmath91 and @xmath92 also go to zero since they have the factors @xmath45 and @xmath90 respectively .",
    "therefore these second and third terms vanish if we set @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and @xmath88 becomes proportional to the volume form @xmath95 on the base .",
    "suppose the @xmath23 fiber becomes zero size at @xmath96 .",
    "this means we set @xmath97 .",
    "we also require @xmath98 due our analysis in the previous paragraph . combining these boundary conditions with the equations of motion ( [ ein eq ] ) , we find , @xmath99 in order for the geometry to terminate smoothly , we need @xmath100 with the coefficient @xmath101 in the leading term .",
    "this condition turns out to be implied by the einstein equations .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of witten s instanton , for which an analogue of @xmath102 has to be imposed as an additional boundary condition .",
    "thus , we find that there are three parameters @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 at the bubble . as we will see below , they can be fixed by demanding the three non - normalizable modes , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath85 , to vanish at the infinity .",
    "the location @xmath106 of the bubble is fixed by demanding @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "interestingly , both the equations of motion and the boundary conditions defined in the last two sections are compatible with two simple algebraic relations between the three functions @xmath109 . in fact , if we set , @xmath110 and substitute them into the equations of motion ( [ ein eq ] ) , we find a couple of equations that are independent of @xmath111 : @xmath112 and @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "demanding that these equations hold independently of @xmath115 , we obtain four differential equations on @xmath116 and @xmath117 with respect to @xmath79 .",
    "remarkably , these four equations can be solved algebraically by imposing the simple relations , @xmath118    these algebraic relations are also consistent with the boundary conditions at @xmath96 and @xmath119 : setting @xmath120 gives @xmath121 and @xmath122 as expected at the bubble , and @xmath123 at @xmath11 gives @xmath124 and @xmath125 as required for ads@xmath20 .",
    "we found these relations experimentally , and it would be interesting to find their deeper origins . in the following ,",
    "we will use them to numerically integrate the rest of the equations of motion .",
    "using of the algebraic relations ( [ relations ] ) , the equations of motion ( [ ein eq ] ) collapse to the following three equations for the two functions @xmath111 and @xmath44 , @xmath126 only two of these three equations are independent . eliminating @xmath111 , one finds the following equation for @xmath44 , @xmath127 this is a third order differential equation for @xmath44 .",
    "since it does not depend on @xmath13 explicitly , one can lower its order by one .",
    "the numerical integration of this equation shows the desired behavior , @xmath77 , @xmath44 goes from @xmath128 to @xmath129 as @xmath13 goes from @xmath106 to @xmath119 .    ) , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    we would like to comment on two important features of our numerical solutions :    1 .",
    "the equation for @xmath44 is singular at the bubble , and the coeffieint of @xmath130 vanishes with @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , instead of numerically integrating the equation with the initial value of @xmath131 , we computed first few terms in the taylor expansion analytically and matched them to a numerical solution .",
    "2 .   in this section",
    ", we are not requiring the @xmath85 mode to vanish at @xmath108 .",
    "thus , we are left with one free parameter @xmath103 , which is the size of the bubble .",
    "we presented the typical behavior of the solution on the figure 1 , where we set @xmath132 .",
    "the horizontal axis is @xmath133 , where @xmath106 is fixed by demanding @xmath134 as @xmath108 .",
    "one can see that the solution exhibits the desired behavior : @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 as @xmath68 .",
    "we have shown that there is a family of solutions parameterized by the size @xmath103 of the bubble , which approach ads@xmath25 at infinity .",
    "however , there is one more non - normalizable mode @xmath85 we need to fix . in this section ,",
    "we show that one can turn off this mode by adjusting  @xmath103 .",
    "this also makes the instanton action finite .    for general value of the parameter @xmath103",
    ", the solution at the infinity behaves as @xmath139 numerically , @xmath140 vanishes at @xmath141 . to show that @xmath140 can be set exactly equal to zero by adjusting @xmath103 , we present figure 2 for @xmath142 . since @xmath143 for @xmath108",
    ", we see that @xmath140 changes its sign near @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , there must be @xmath103 near @xmath144 such that @xmath145 .     and its derivative .",
    "the horizontal axises are @xmath133 .",
    "values of @xmath103 from top to bottom are 0.63 , 0.62 , 0.61 respectively.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the action for 11-dimensional supergravity takes the form , @xmath146 where we have ignored the chern - simons terms and fermions , which are irrelevant to our discussion . using the supergravity equations ( [ sugra eq ] ) , the 4-form kinetic term is related to the einstein term , @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , the instanton action reduces to , @xmath148 it is straightforward to see that , with the @xmath85 mode removed , the instanton action is finite and positive after subtracting the value for the vacuum ads .",
    "we conclude that ads@xmath25 is unstable due to the finite action instanton .",
    "in this section , we will show that ads@xmath26 model has an instanton that mediates its decay .",
    "it is not know whether this solution is perturbative stable or not . in either case",
    ", the existence of the bubble of nothing solution shown here means that it is unstable .    to construct the solution ,",
    "let us first review the geometry of @xmath150 .",
    "it can be viewed as a flag manifold @xmath151 or a twistor space over @xmath152 .",
    "it admits khler structure with an einstein metric and therefore is a solution of the supergravity equations of motion .",
    "it is also an @xmath23 fibration over @xmath152 base .",
    "the last fact is best understood from the coset point of view .",
    "one can choose @xmath153 subgroup in @xmath18 and decompose @xmath154 .",
    "the former term in the product is homogeneous space @xmath17 and the latter is @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 is a @xmath155 fibration over @xmath17 .",
    "the two @xmath156 subgroups in the denominator of the coset @xmath157 turn each sphere into complex projective space resulting in @xmath158 fibration .",
    "it worth mentioning that both @xmath22 and @xmath157 are twistor spaces of @xmath24 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this fact seems to be the main reason of the similarity between the collapsing solutions of the models . choosing the vielbein as @xcite : @xmath159 with @xmath160 all the formulas and results",
    "become exactly the same as in @xmath22 case .",
    "namely , @xmath157 has the @xmath18-structure defined by ( [ su3 def ] ) and has torsion classes  ( [ torsion ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath18-structure is the same , the ansatz for the flux will have the same solution  ( [ flux sol ] ) . finally and most importantly , the equations of motion of supergravity take exactly the same form   ( [ ein eq ] ) .",
    "the last fact makes all the results of the previous sections applicable to this case .",
    "the only thing which is different is the expression of the vielbein in terms of the coordinates .",
    "one might wonder why the equations are exactly the same .",
    "it follows from the fact that we constructed the ansatz which respects all the symmetries of the model with squashed fiber .",
    "the bases of the compact manifold in both cases are einstein manifolds and therefore their contribution to the einstein equations will enter in a similar manner .",
    "besides , the @xmath18-structure is rooted in the twistor origin of both spaces and it is used to build the ansatz for the flux . because of the same origin , it gives the same result in both cases .",
    "we would like to end this paper by explaining how our solution evades the issue raised in @xcite .",
    "suppose we try to collapse a @xmath161-dimensional sphere in the internal space supported by a flux , at the bubble located at @xmath96 .",
    "the flux gives contribution to the einstein equations proportional to @xmath162 , where @xmath45 is the square radius of the sphere , while the contribution from curvature is proportional to @xmath163 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath164 for the smoothness , it was argued in @xcite that the only possible way to make this two terms of the same order is to set @xmath165 , @xmath77 , a circle .",
    "however , this does not apply to our case since the amount of flux on the sphere can vary .",
    "it is instructive to see it explicitly in the einstein equation ( [ ein eq ] ) for @xmath45 , @xmath166 one can see that curvature contribution ( first term ) is of order @xmath163 , while the flux ( last term ) is of order @xmath167 ( flux for the @xmath24 is proportional to the 4th power of @xmath44 as it should ) .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate of @xcite for @xmath168 .",
    "however , in our solution , these two terms can balance each other since @xmath137 when @xmath169 . in this way",
    ", the flux evaporates from the @xmath23 fiber , and the einstein equations can be satisfied .",
    "another possibility to deal with flux conservation is to introduce a domain wall at the bubble to absorb the flux .",
    "this idea was used in @xcite to collapse the supersymmetry breaking @xmath21 in the ads@xmath14 geometry of @xcite .",
    "more recently , instanton solutions with @xmath23 collapsing have been constructed in some models in six dimensions .",
    "blanco - pillardo , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered the einstein gravity in six dimensions coupled to @xmath153 yang - mills gauge field and an adjoint higgs field with a specific potential to break the gauge group to @xmath156 and found a smooth solution of this type .",
    "brown and dahlen @xcite considred the einstein - maxwell system without the higgs and added a domain wall as a source",
    ". it would be interesting to realize such solutions in a low energy effective theory of m / string theory in a controlled approximation .    according to @xcite ,",
    "ads@xmath170 and ads@xmath171 are not stable perturbatively .",
    "thus , we do not need instantons for these geometries to be consistent with the conjecture of @xcite .",
    "in fact , our ansatz is not applicable to them since the configurations are too restrictive for the fluxes to slip off . in our solution",
    ", it is important that @xmath22 has the non - trivial fibration structure and not a direct product since this allows our non - trivial solution to the 4-form equations .",
    "a similar argument applies to the freud - rubin type compactification ( when the flux is proportional to the volume form of the ads ) and the compactifications where the flux is proportional to the volume form of the compact space ( unless one can turn on other lower dimensional form ) .",
    "finally , we want to mention that it is possible that our solution is related to resolved m - theory conifold solutions with @xmath172-holonomy@xcite .",
    "they are ricci - flat seven - dimensional manifolds which have conic structure and its metrics reads , @xmath173 where @xmath174 is either @xmath24 or @xmath152 and @xmath175 is metrics on the @xmath23 fiber which are exactly the same as in the present paper for @xmath22 and @xmath150 respectively . moreover , the @xmath23 fiber collapse at finite @xmath176 , while @xmath174 radius stays finite .",
    "unfortunately , the radii grow linearly at infinity",
    ". it may be possible to construct a desirable solution by multiplying this geometry with the flat @xmath177 and by adding some flux along the conifold in order to change the behavior at infinity from the linear growth to constant .",
    "an idea along this line may allow us to generalize our solutions further .",
