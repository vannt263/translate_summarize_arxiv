    "there have been many classical calculations of the energy of a plasma @xcite .",
    "they are based on perturbation theory of an ideal gas , in terms of the plasma parameter @xmath5 ( which usually is a small value ) .",
    "the treatment , to the first order in @xmath5 , is the debye - hckel theory .",
    "however , in the calculations that have been made it is assumed that @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . this is a very strong assumption .",
    "for example , in our previous analysis @xcite , we showed that only by not assuming @xmath3 , is the blackbody spectrum obtained .",
    "we evaluate the energy of a plasma , studying the electromagnetic fluctuations in a plasma without assuming that @xmath3 .",
    "a plasma in thermal equilibrium sustains fluctuations of the magnetic and electric fields .",
    "the electromagnetic fluctuations are described by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the electromagnetic fluctuations in a plasma has been made in numerous studies @xcite .",
    "recently , cable and tajima @xcite ( see also @xcite ) studied the magnetic field fluctuations in a cold plasma description with a constant collision frequency as well as for a warm , gaseous plasma , described by kinetic theory .    using a model that extends the work of cable and tajima @xcite",
    ", we study an electron - proton plasma of temperature @xmath6 with densities @xmath7 .",
    "the condition for a classical analysis is that @xmath8 , where @xmath1 is the de broglie wavelength for a thermal electron and @xmath9 , the distance of closest approach .",
    "this condition is satisfied for @xmath10 and for the plasmas studied .    in section [ sec : flu ]",
    "we recall the expressions for the electromagnetic fluctuations in a plasma , and in section [ sec : ene ] , the electromagnetic energy is computed .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in section [ sec : co ] .",
    "the spectra of the electromagnetic fluctuations in an isotropic plasma are given by @xcite , @xmath11 @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the longitudinal and transverse dielectric permittivities of the plasma .",
    "the first and second terms of eq .",
    "( [ ele ] ) are the longitudinal and transverse electric field fluctuations , respectively .    by using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , we can estimate the energy in the electromagnetic fluctuations for all frequencies and wave numbers .",
    "the calculation includes not only the energy of the fluctuations in the well defined modes of the plasma , such as plasmons in the longitudinal component and photons in the transverse component , but also the energy in fluctuations that do not propagate .    for the description of the plasma",
    ", we use the model described in detail in opher and opher @xcite .",
    "the description includes thermal and collisional effects .",
    "it uses the equation of vlasov in first order , with the bgk ( bhatnagar - gross - krook ) collision term that is a model equation of the boltzmann collision term @xcite .",
    "we used the bgk collision term as a rough guide for the inclusion of collisions in a plasma .    from this description , the dielectric permittivities for an isotropic plasma",
    "are easily obtained : @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the label for the species of particles , @xmath19 the thermal velocity for the species and @xmath20 , the fried and conte function .",
    "in order to estimate the electromagnetic energy , we use the dielectric permittivities , given by eqs .",
    "( [ el ] ) and ( [ et ] ) , and calculate the magnetic and the electric field spectra from eqs .",
    "( [ ele ] ) and ( [ magn ] ) . integrating the spectra in wave number and frequency ( and dividing by @xmath21 ) , we obtain the energy densities of the magnetic field @xmath22 and of the transverse and longitudinal electric fields @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    usually , when estimating the energy stored in the electromagnetic fluctuations from eqs .",
    "( [ ele ] ) and ( [ magn ] ) , it is assumed that @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . with this assumption , the kramers - kronig relations",
    "can then be used , and a simple expression for the energy is obtained @xcite . however , the assumption that @xmath3 is very restrictive .",
    "for example , a large part of the fluctuations which create the blackbody electromagnetic spectrum has @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore necessary to perform the integration of the spectra over frequency and wave number without using this assumption .",
    "our model uses kinetic theory with a collision term that describes the binary collisions in the plasma .",
    "a cutoff has to be taken since , for very small distances , the energy of the coulomb interaction excedes the kinetic energy .",
    "this occurs for distances @xmath26 , which defines our maximum wave number , @xmath27 .",
    "a large @xmath27 is needed in order to reproduce the blackbody spectrum . in this study , we used a @xmath27 equal to the inverse of the distance of closest approach , which we previously found is able to do this @xcite .",
    "any smaller @xmath27 was unable to reproduce the entire blackbody spectrum .",
    "in the usual classical calculations , the correction to the energy due to correlations between the particles , is made through the _ correlation energy_. to the first order in the plasma parameter @xmath5 , the correlation energy depends on the two - particle correlation function @xmath28 , @xmath29 where the second term is the energy of the particles due to their own fields .",
    "@xmath28 can be estimated by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem or by the bbgky hierarchy equations @xcite .",
    "generally , it is assumed that @xmath3 ( so the kramers - kronig relation can be used ) and @xmath28 is obtained as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the inverse of the debye length .    with this",
    ", the energy density of a plasma to first order in @xmath5 is given as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number density of the particles .",
    "thus , the correlation energy , to the first order in @xmath5 is @xmath34    we define the energy of a plasma as @xmath35 with this definition , @xmath36 , for the previous classical analysis ( eq .",
    "( 7 ) ) , where the subscript `` 0 '' means that the assumption @xmath3 has been used .",
    "higher order calculations of the correlation energy have been made , for example by oneil and rostoker @xcite .",
    "however , in all treatments , the assumption @xmath3 has been made . as we commented above , the assumption @xmath3 is very strong .",
    "a large part of the fluctuations has @xmath25 .    to obtain the interaction energy",
    ", we need to subtract the energy of the particles due to their own fields , the second term of eq .",
    "( 5 ) , from the longitudinal energy density , @xmath24 .",
    "we thus have @xmath37 . using eq .",
    "( 9 ) , the interaction energy can be written as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the equivalent of the correlation energy .",
    "in fact , using the approximation @xmath3 , @xmath39 is equal to the second term of eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) .    in order to compare @xmath39 with @xmath40",
    ", we define the parameter , @xmath41    we previously found @xcite that the transverse energy ( summing the transverse electric and magnetic field energies , @xmath23 and @xmath22 ) has an additional energy , compared to the blackbody energy density in vacuum .",
    "the additional transverse energy is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the photon energy density , estimated as the blackbody energy density in vacuum .    adding the interaction energy @xmath39 to @xmath44",
    ", we obtain the total change in the energy density due to the transverse and longitudinal components , @xmath45    we calculate @xmath46 and @xmath39 for an electron - proton plasma at @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath47 for densities ranging from @xmath49 .",
    "the densities were chosen so as to assure that the plasma parameter , @xmath50 , in order that kinetic theory is valid .",
    "for these plasmas , the de broglie wavelength is less than the distance of closest approach of thermal electrons , which justifies our classical treatment .    in figure 1 , we plot @xmath51 as a function of the density @xmath52 for the temperatures @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "we extended each plot until the density for which @xmath56 was reached .",
    "for each of the temperatures , the value of @xmath5 increases with the density . in the case of @xmath47 , for example , for @xmath57 , @xmath58 and for @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "when @xmath56 , @xmath61 . in the case of @xmath53 , for @xmath57 , @xmath60 and for @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "when @xmath56 , @xmath64 .",
    "we found a very good fit for the results of figure 1 , using a fermi - dirac functional form for the density dependence of @xmath51 , @xmath65 + 1)$ ] , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; @xmath68 and @xmath69 . from figure 1 , we obtain @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the curves ( filled , dashed and dotted ) are evaluated from the analytic expression ; the filled squares are the calculated values of @xmath51 from eqs .",
    "( 1)-(4 ) .",
    "the fit can be seen to be excellent . in figure 2 , we plot @xmath73 as a function of the density , for the temperatures @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which shows how @xmath51 differs from the usual correction @xmath74 .",
    "the values of @xmath51 that we obtained are positive and larger in absolute value than @xmath74 , whereas @xmath74 is negative .",
    "this indicates that the energy in the fluctuations dominates the interaction energy of the particles .",
    "we observe that @xmath75 can reach values of a thousand or greater .",
    "the additional transverse energy @xmath44 is completely negligible for these temperatures and densities .",
    "for example , for @xmath47 and @xmath61 , @xmath76 .",
    "for this temperature and density , @xmath77 and @xmath46 is completely dominated by @xmath78 .",
    "for example , for @xmath47 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 .    as a check , we calculated @xmath39 , integrating in frequency only up to @xmath81 , the plasma frequency @xmath82 , and integrating in wavenumber up to @xmath83 .",
    "as expected , we then found that @xmath51 is equal to @xmath74 , the value obtained in previous analysis .",
    "we calculated @xmath46 and @xmath39 for an electron - proton plasma as a function of density for @xmath84 . for many interesting plasmas",
    ", we found that @xmath85 .",
    "we used the bgk collison term as a rough guide to the inclusion of collisions .",
    "the bgk is a model collision term for the boltzmann collision term .",
    "collisions , however , change the results very little . for example , for @xmath47 and @xmath62 , the difference in @xmath86 , with or without collisions , is less than @xmath87 . since there is no significant difference between the energy density , with or without the collision term , the use of a more acurate collision term than the bgk collision term is not necessary .",
    "appreciably different values than the usual ones are obtained , for the interaction energy of a plasma , by not assuming @xmath3 . to the first order in @xmath5",
    ", we found that the energy of an ideal gas needs to be corrected by a positive value , approximately @xmath88 .",
    "this results in very different values from the usual ones @xmath89 .",
    "our results may be applied to the plasma before the recombination era , when the plasma had a temperature @xmath90 and a density @xmath91 . since the expansion rate of the universe ( the hubble parameter ) is proportional to the square root of the plasma energy density ,",
    "our results indicate that the universe before the recombination era was expanding appreciably faster than previously thought .",
