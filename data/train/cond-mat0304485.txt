    "the rich collective behavior , including mutual entrainment and self - synchronization , in systems of coupled oscillators has been considered by several investigators in the past few years ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , a considerable amount of research has been devoted to the study of coupled _ chaotic _ oscillators and , in particular , to the phenomenon of phase synchronization .",
    "provided that the phase can be defined @xcite , two coupled nonidentical chaotic oscillators are said to be phase synchronized if their frequencies are locked but their amplitudes are not @xcite .",
    "this appears to be a general phenomenon and it has been observed in systems as diverse as electrically coupled neurons @xcite , biomedical systems @xcite , chemical systems @xcite , and spatially extended ecological systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , the potential role of phase synchronization in brain functions has been explored @xcite .    the most common theoretical approach to phase synchronization of chaotic oscillators is based on an analogy with the evolution of the phase of a periodic oscillator in the presence of external noise @xcite .",
    "this approach leads to the conclusion that the dynamics of the phase is generally diffusive and the phase performs a random walk .",
    "however , the effective `` noise '' in such a description can not be considered as a gaussian @xmath0-correlated noise in all circumstances . in this paper",
    "we show that the effective `` noise '' exhibits strong temporal ( anti-)correlations for a general class of chaotic attractors",
    ". in particular , we present evidence from simulations and experiments that many phase synchronized systems of chaotic oscillators where the chaotic state is reached through a period - doubling cascade show a rapid convergence of the time - averaged frequency .",
    "the speed of convergence toward the natural frequency scales as the inverse of the measurement period .",
    "this implies that short measurement times may suffice for reliable determination of frequencies in those systems .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : section  [ sec : back ] presents a sketch of the theoretical background of phase dynamics in chaotic systems and the expected scaling of the time - averaged frequency with the observation time .",
    "the results of numerical simulations of globally coupled arrays of rssler oscillators are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] where features of the chaotic attractor leading to rapid convergence of the time - averaged frequency are identified .",
    "section  [ sec : exp ] contains a description and analysis of experimental results on a globally coupled array of electrochemical oscillators where rapid frequency convergence is observed .",
    "an appropriate definition of the phase for chaotic self - sustained oscillators can be obtained from the poincar map of the flow . such a map can be constructed if a surface of section in the phase space of the autonomous continuous - time chaotic system exists which is crossed transversally by all trajectories of the chaotic attractor .",
    "then , for each piece of a trajectory between two crossings of this surface , we define the phase as a linear function of time : @xmath1 for @xmath2 . here",
    ", @xmath3 is the time of the @xmath4th crossing of the surface of section .",
    "the definition is ambiguous because it depends on the choice of the poincar surface . yet",
    ", any choice of a phase variable for chaotic oscillators investigated in this paper leads to the same macroscopic behavior @xcite .    with this phase definition ,",
    "the phase dynamics can be described by @xmath5 where the amplitude @xmath6 is the set of coordinates of the phase point on the poincar surface at the nth intersection and @xmath7 defines the poincar map that takes @xmath6 to @xmath8 .",
    "the  instantaneous \" frequency @xmath9 is determined by the poincar return time @xmath10 and depends in general on the amplitude .",
    "assuming chaotic behavior of the amplitudes , we can consider the term @xmath11 to be the sum of the average ( natural ) frequency @xmath12 and some effective  noise \" @xmath13 with zero mean , although this stochastic term has a purely deterministic origin @xcite .",
    "thus , eq.([phase - equ ] ) has the solution @xmath14 the variance of the integral @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 here , @xmath17 and the average @xmath18 is taken over the invariant measure of the chaotic attractor .",
    "the approximate equality holds provided that @xmath19 has a finite correlation time @xmath20 such that @xmath21 for @xmath22 and one considers times @xmath23 .",
    "this shows that the dynamics of the phase is diffusive and the phase performs a random walk as long as @xmath20 is finite and @xmath24 .",
    "however , as pointed out by pikovsky and co - workers @xcite , the dynamics of the phase generally differs from stochastic brownian motion because the effective  noise \" can not be considered as a gaussian white noise process .",
    "this was recently confirmed for a system of locally coupled rssler oscillators where temporal correlations were shown to exist @xcite .",
    "these correlations determine the speed of convergence of the time average @xmath25 toward @xmath26 .",
    "the speed of convergence  as measured by the standard deviation of the ensemble distribution of @xmath27  scales as @xmath28 .",
    "this is in contrast to what one would expect if @xmath29 were a white noise process where one obtains @xmath30 scaling since @xmath31 and the standard deviation of @xmath32 scales with @xmath33 . here , we provide further numerical and experimental evidence that such a scaling generally occurs for oscillators where the chaotic state is reached through a period - doubling cascade .",
    "in particular , the type of coupling between the chaotic oscillators seems to be irrelevant .",
    "moreover , we show that the temporal correlations induce an alternating behavior of @xmath34 .",
    "this leads to an extremely small value of @xmath35 for these systems and suggests that they can generally be phase synchronized .",
    "we consider a @xmath36 array of _ globally _ coupled , nonidentical chaotic rssler oscillators : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the sites of the lattice are labelled by @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the coupling constant and @xmath44 is the set of all sites on the lattice .",
    "we take @xmath45 and choose the @xmath46 s randomly from a uniform distribution on the interval @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "this ensures that all oscillators are chaotic .",
    "we find that the speed of convergence of @xmath48 toward @xmath12 in the phase synchronized state scales as @xmath28 ( see fig .",
    "[ scaling_l ] ) .",
    "this is also true for higher @xmath49 dispersion .",
    "the @xmath28 scaling observed in the globally coupled rssler system follows from the fact that the local chaotic attractors , although one - banded in the phase synchronized state ( see fig .",
    "[ attractor ] ) , have internal structure .    left panel : @xmath50 projection of the local attractor at a single site of the lattice for @xmath51 in the phase synchronized state .",
    "all local attractors look similar to the one shown here .",
    "right panel : a typical @xmath52 histogram @xmath53 of the nonidentical chaotic oscillators for @xmath54 , i.e. , the distribution of the natural periods .",
    "the exact shape of the distribution depends on the @xmath55 realization . ]    in the absence of coupling ( @xmath54 ) the local non - identical rssler oscillators display a variety of banded chaotic attractors because of period - doubling cascades and period-3 windows in their vicinity . in the phase synchronized state for @xmath51 ,",
    "the local chaotic attractors are very similar to one another and have an internal structure similar to that of a merged two - banded attractor . although this structure is not obvious in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ attractor ] , it can be seen clearly in the local next amplitude maps ( fig .",
    "[ nextamp_d006 ] ) and in the density distribution @xmath56 ( inset in fig .  [ nextamp_d006 ] ) .",
    "the intersection point of the map with the bisectrix defines four regions in the map such that the two - bandedness of the attractor can be characterized by the percentage @xmath57 of points in the upper left and lower right quarter - planes .",
    "indeed , only very few points @xmath58  typically those for small @xmath59 s which are in the lower left quarter - plane of the amplitude map  stay in the same region of the bimodal density distribution , implying that the majority of the iterates map regions of high density on the left to regions of high density on the right and vice versa .",
    "superposition of eight local next amplitude maps for @xmath51 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath59 chosen here is the negative @xmath60 coordinate of @xmath6 because the @xmath61 coordinate is almost constant and very close to zero .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the intersection point of the bisectrix with the map .",
    "inset : density distribution @xmath62 along the curve formed by the next amplitude maps . ]",
    "this nearly two - banded character is also seen in the series of @xmath63 s ( see fig .  [ instantt_d006 ] ) .",
    "an alternation of long and short return times can be observed with rare exceptions .",
    "this shows the close relation between topological characteristics ( next amplitude map ) and temporal evolution ( @xmath64 map ) and suggests the following explanation for the observed scaling :    time series of @xmath63 for @xmath51 ( left panel ) and the corresponding @xmath64 map ( right panel ) .",
    "the arrow highlights a deviation from the alternating behavior .",
    "these deviations occur with @xmath65 at this particular site of the lattice which is the percentage of points in the upper right and lower left quarter - plane in the lower panel .",
    "note that only a short segment of the @xmath63 series is shown . ]    assuming that each internal `` band '' of the attractor is associated with a distinct mean frequency @xmath66 or @xmath67 such that @xmath68 , and the system alternates between bands , the `` random '' force in the evolution equation ( [ phase - equ ] ) for the phase of a single oscillator takes the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 when the system is on band 1(2 ) .",
    "the noise term @xmath71 accounts for deviations of the period within a band and deviations from the strict alternations between bands .",
    "if @xmath72 is the time needed for @xmath4 oscillations , it follows from eq.([phase - sol ] ) that @xmath73 where @xmath70 corresponds to band 1(2 ) appearing first in the series .",
    "the term @xmath74 scales with @xmath28 , while the term @xmath75 scales with @xmath30 provided that @xmath71 is @xmath0-correlated noise .",
    "since the amplitude of the @xmath30 term is very small , two scaling regimes can be identified for the maximal deviation from @xmath12 : a @xmath28 scaling on intermediate time scales which is dominated by the switching between the `` bands '' and a @xmath30 scaling on long time scales .",
    "the intermediate time scale scaling behavior can indeed be observed for each oscillator : the envelope of @xmath76 decays as @xmath28 .",
    "note that the standard deviation of the ensemble distribution of @xmath27 decays as @xmath30 for identical chaotic rssler oscillators and @xmath54  as expected from the law of large numbers .",
    "in the case of nonidentical oscillators , phase synchronization implies that the phases are synchronized such that @xmath77 , where the average is taken over the ensemble , adopts the scaling of a single oscillator reproducing the observed scaling and explaining the results .",
    "this result does not depend on the type of coupling of the oscillators as confirmed by the numerical results presented here @xcite and in ref .",
    "this explanation is based exclusively on the fact that the series of the instantaneous frequencies alternates with the exception of rare events and that the system is phase synchronized .",
    "the above argument easily generalizes to attractors with multiple internal  bands \" which we observe in the phase synchronized state for higher coupling .",
    "figure  [ nextamp_d02 ] shows that the deviations from a three - banded structure are rather small for @xmath78 .",
    "three bands a , b and c can be identified such that a is mapped to b and c to a. however , band b is mapped to c and z , and z back to b such that a pure three - banded structure does not exist .",
    "the invariant measure of the map in area z is very low ( approximately @xmath79 ) .",
    "superposition of the next amplitude maps for @xmath78 at the same sites as in fig .",
    "[ nextamp_d006 ] .",
    "inset : normalized point density along the curve formed by the next amplitude maps .",
    "three regions of high density can be identified . ]",
    "the alternation of positive and negative values for @xmath80 implies that @xmath34 alternates as well .",
    "hence , @xmath35 is very small , i.e. , a high degree of phase coherence persists .",
    "our findings suggest that this should be generally expected for oscillators where the chaotic state is reached through a period - doubling cascade .",
    "thus , these oscillators would be phase coherent suggesting that they can generically be phase synchronized .",
    "the change in the structure of the local attractors as the coupling strength is changed is the analog of the bifurcation structure seen in homogeneous locally coupled rssler oscillators where one finds period doubling different from the isolated rssler oscillator @xcite .",
    "we now study the convergence of the time - averaged frequency in an array of globally coupled electrochemical oscillators . a standard three electrode electrochemical cell consisting of a nickel working electrode array ( 64 1-mm diameter electrodes in an @xmath81 geometry with 2 mm spacing ) , a @xmath82 reference electrode and a pt mesh counter electrode were used .",
    "the potentials of all of the electrodes in the array were held at the same value ( @xmath83 ) with a potentiostat ( eg&g princeton applied research , model 273 ) .",
    "experiments were carried out in 4.5 m @xmath84 solution at a temperature of @xmath85 .",
    "the working electrodes were embedded in epoxy and reaction takes place only at the ends .",
    "the currents of the electrodes were measured independently at a sampling rate of 100 hz and thus the rate of reaction as a function of position and time was obtained .",
    "the electrodes were connected to the potentiostat through 64 individual parallel resistors ( @xmath86 ) and through one series collective resistor ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "we employed a method of altering the strength of global coupling while holding all other parameters constant .",
    "the total external resistance was held constant while the fraction dedicated to individual currents , as opposed to the total current , was varied .",
    "a total resistance can be defined as @xmath88 in these experiments @xmath89 .",
    "the series resistor couples the electrodes globally .",
    "the parameter @xmath90 , the ratio of series to total resistance , is a measure of the global coupling @xmath91 for @xmath92 , the external resistance furnishes no additional global coupling ; for @xmath93 , maximal external global coupling is achieved .",
    "the population of chaotic oscillators is characterized by certain amount of heterogeneity @xcite . without added coupling",
    "there is a distribution of frequencies of the oscillators with a mean of @xmath94 and a standard deviation of @xmath95 . with weak added global coupling ( @xmath96 ) a nearly phase synchronized state",
    "occurs in which 63 of 64 oscillators have a frequency of @xmath97 , and that of the remaining element has a frequency of @xmath98 .",
    "the results are shown for this region of high phase synchrony .",
    "the chaotic attractor of a representative single element of the coupled system is shown in fig .",
    "[ attr - exp ] .",
    "the chaotic state is adjacent to a period - three window and a period doubling sequence .",
    "the reconstructed attractor ( fig .",
    "[ attr - exp]a ) is low - dimensional ( correlation dimension @xmath99 ) . to obtain the phase , the hilbert transform approach",
    "is applied @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional embedding using hilbert transform is shown in fig .",
    "[ attr - exp]b . as in the case of globally coupled rssler oscillators",
    ", it is difficult to distinguish the banded character of the attractor .",
    "the merged banded structure is more clearly seen in return maps obtained from the series of return times ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the series of the return time clearly shows an alternation of long and short oscillations ( fig . [ exp_tn]a ) . the map constructed using @xmath63 exhibits an approximately one - dimensional character ( fig . [",
    "exp_tn]b ) .",
    "the oscillators in the population are slightly different . figure  [ exp_twobanded]a shows a superposition of the 1d maps of all the oscillators .",
    "clearly , the majority of the phase points lie in the upper left and lower right boxes indicating two - banded character .",
    "the probability of two - banded oscillations varies from one site to the other ( fig .",
    "[ exp_twobanded]b ) with a mean of @xmath100 and a standard deviation of @xmath101 .",
    "we note that the two - banded character of the uncoupled system of uncoupled oscillators ( @xmath92 , @xmath102 , figs .",
    "[ exp_twobanded]c and d ) is smaller than that of the phase synchronized region .",
    "therefore , during the transition to phase synchronization with increasing the coupling strength the two - bandedness observed in the time series of oscillations is more pronounced .    as expected from the numerical simulations and theoretical considerations , the strong ( anti)correlations in the phase dynamics have pronounced effects on the speed of convergence of frequencies .",
    "figure  [ scaling - exp ] shows that the standard deviation of frequencies is proportional to @xmath28 at @xmath103 .",
    "( the fluctuations around the fitted line are caused by slowing down and speeding up within a cycle . )",
    "similar scaling results are obtained for other ( larger ) coupling strengths .",
    "for many systems of coupled oscillators , the chaotic state is reached through a period - doubling cascade .",
    "this implies that a poincar surface exists such that the next - amplitude map is similar to that in figs .",
    "[ nextamp_d006 ] or [ nextamp_d02 ] .",
    "as long as the correspondence between the next - amplitude map and the relation of subsequent return times holds , this should lead to a small value of @xmath35 and , in particular , to a @xmath28 scaling in the phase synchronized state .",
    "the experimental results show that such a structure of the series of return times can exists even if no well - behaved next - amplitude map can be identified .",
    "our findings further suggest that chaotic oscillators where the chaotic state is reached through a period - doubling cascade can generally be phase synchronized due to the small value of @xmath35 , i.e. , high degree of phase coherence .",

    "@xcite where different chaotic systems were analyzed with respect to their ability to be phase synchronized .",
    "there it was found that the lorenz system ( where the chaotic attractor is not reached through a period - doubling cascade ) can not be phase synchronized . in particular , the next amplitude map has a very different structure , i.e. , a logarithmic singularity .",
