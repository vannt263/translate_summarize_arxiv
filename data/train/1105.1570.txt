    "recent experiments on quantum gases in one - dimension ( 1d ) @xcite provide an exciting way to test 1d many - body physics extensively studied in the literature via the bethe ansatz ( ba ) @xcite , effective field theory @xcite and other theoretical methods .",
    "novel 1d many - body physics such as the phenomena of spin - charge separation @xcite , universal luttinger liquid thermodynamics @xcite and quantum criticality , are quite different from higher dimensional physics .",
    "1d many - body systems also provide insights into higher dimensional physics .",
    "for example , theoretical predictions for the existence of a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) @xcite like pairing state in the 1d interacting fermi gas have emerged @xcite .",
    "a scheme for mapping out the physical properties of homogeneous systems by the inhomogeneity of the trap has been successfully applied to ultracold atom experiments @xcite , since the thermodynamics of interacting fermionic systems can be measured explicitly and the interaction between fermions can be tuned precisely via a broad feshbach resonance . in particular ,",
    "fermionic alkaline - earth atoms display an exact @xmath1 spin symmetry with @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the nuclear spin @xcite .",
    "for example , a recent experiment dramatically realized the model of fermionic atoms with @xmath4 symmetry where electron spin decouples from its nuclear spin @xmath5 for @xmath6yb @xcite . such fermionic systems with enlarged @xmath1 spin symmetry are expected to display a remarkable diversity of new quantum phases and quantum critical phenomena due to the existence of multiple charge bound states @xcite .",
    "the strongly attractive multi - component fermi gases with higher spin symmetries have also been investigated via the bethe ansatz method @xcite .",
    "these developments provide an exciting opportunity to explore the universal thermodynamics and quantum critical behavior of strongly interacting fermions with high spin symmetries in 1d .",
    "the bethe ansatz has proven to be a powerful method to study 1d quantum gases .",
    "this method was applied to the 1d bose gas by lieb and liniger @xcite and to the spin-1/2 fermi gas by yang @xcite and gaudin @xcite .",
    "after that , the multi - component fermi gas was studied by sutherland @xcite .",
    "the study of the thermodynamics of the attractive fermi gas was initiated by yang @xcite and takahashi @xcite .",
    "moreover , the thermodynamics of 1d fermi gases is also widely studied for its rich physics . for spin-@xmath7 fermions with attractive interaction , the phase diagrams and luttinger liquid physics",
    "have been investigated by using both analytical @xcite and numerical methods @xcite .",
    "the key features of this @xmath8 phase diagram were experimentally confirmed using finite temperature density profiles of trapped fermionic @xmath9li atoms @xcite .    for the strongly attractive spin-1/2 fermi gas at finite temperatures , the thermodynamics of the homogeneous system",
    "is described by two coupled fermi gases of bound pairs and excess fermions in the charge sector and ferromagnetic spin - spin interaction in the spin sector @xcite .",
    "spin fluctuations are suppressed by a strong effective magnetic field at low temperatures . however , for the repulsive case , the situation is quite different since spin fluctuations play a dominant role in the low energy physics .",
    "spin fluctuations are described by the @xmath10 antiferromagnetic spin - spin heisenberg system and thus the coupling of charge and spin parts make the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) equations more complex .",
    "so far we know that the wiener - hopf method can be applied here to deal with the spin part of the tba equations for weak magnetic field .",
    "this method was used by mezincescu _",
    "_ to investigate the thermodynamics of heisenberg spin chains with @xmath10 and @xmath0 symmetries @xcite .",

    "the wiener - hopf technique was applied to get the solutions of the tba equations in the spin sector .",
    "then sommerfeld s expansion was utilized in the low temperature limit with strong interactions to get the multi - component tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) form of the free energy , which shows a spin - charge separation with the central charge of the spin and charge parts both equal to @xmath11 .",
    "spin - charge separation is a hallmark of 1d many - body physics .",
    "it is a universal feature that interacting particles `` split '' into spins and charges as temperature tends to absolute zero temperature .",
    "the collective excitations with only spin or charge are called spinon and chargon / holon ( the antiparticle of chargon ) , which have different velocities .",
    "this behavior was studied in different kinds of materials @xcite and recently observed in experiments , for example , of 1d metallic wires on surfaces , 1d organic wires , carbon - nanotubes , quantum wires in semiconductors , and other types of 1d systems .",
    "1d quantum systems with high spin symmetries will give diverse magnetism and exotic properties for these kinds of gases .",
    "however , such systems are more difficult to solve @xcite due to the complicated magnetic ordering .",
    "the three - component fermi gas has @xmath12 symmetry which leads to two sets of spin waves .",
    "it is very interesting to see how the low temperature thermodynamics of such a gas naturally separates into free gaussian field theories for the @xmath13 charge degree of freedom and the two spin sectors .    in this paper , 1d fermions with @xmath12 symmetry is studied by using the wiener - hopf method .",
    "the result shows that the system with strong repulsive interactions at low temperatures has the central charge @xmath14 for the charge sector and central charge @xmath15 for the two spin sectors .",
    "we also derive the leading order finite temperature corrections of the free energy which is consistent with expectations from conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "in addition , the polylog function is used to derive the equation of state in a wider temperature regime .",

    ", the thermodynamics of the system is derived via sommerfeld s expansion for low temperatures and strong interactions .",

    "the function @xmath225 in matrix form is then decomposed into @xmath229\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{2\\pi p\\mathrm{i}}{\\sqrt{3}c } \\left[\\frac{1 } { \\omega+\\mathrm{i}\\epsilon}\\mathbf{g_-}(-\\mathrm{i}\\epsilon)\\left (                                          \\begin{array}{c }                                            1 \\\\                                            1 \\\\",

    "when @xmath231 , both the left - hand side and right - hand side tend to zero , thus @xmath232 which gives @xmath233.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since @xmath234 and @xmath142 is analytic on the upper - half plane , the following result @xmath235 is given by contour integration .",
    "this boundary condition is equivalent to @xmath236 using this result we can show that @xmath237    besides , note that @xmath238 thus we find the expression of @xmath239 @xmath240",
    "similarly for @xmath241 with the factorization ( [ factori ] ) , we find that @xmath242 with similar arguments as before , we only need to find a decomposition of @xmath243 into the sum of two functions that are analytic on the upper - half plane and lower - half plane , respectively .",
    "consider the functions @xmath244    after taking a fourier transformation , the matrix @xmath245 can be expressed in terms of the kernel @xmath246 as @xmath247 where @xmath248 multiplying @xmath249 on both sides of this equation , we have @xmath250 substituting this relation back into equation ( [ gpm2 ] ) gives @xmath251    based on analyticity arguments , matrix elements on both sides of the equation are equal to a function that we shall denote in matrix form by @xmath252 , i.e. , @xmath253 similarly to @xmath223 , the function @xmath241 vanishes when @xmath254 . because @xmath252 is an entire function that is bounded , it is equal to a constant by louville s theorem .",
    "this constant can be determined by taking the limit @xmath254 which gives @xmath255 .",
    "hence we finally obtain an equation for @xmath241 expressed in terms of functions whose values are known , i.e. , @xmath256",
