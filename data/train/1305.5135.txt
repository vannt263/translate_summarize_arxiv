    "the bcs theory @xcite was introduced in 1957 to describe superconductivity , and was later extended to the context of superfluidity @xcite as a microscopic description of fermionic gases with local pair interactions at low temperatures .",
    "it can be deduced from quantum physics in three steps .",
    "one restricts the allowed states of the system to quasi - free states , assumes translation - invariance and @xmath0 rotation invariance , and finally dismisses the direct and exchange terms in the energy . with these approximations , the resulting bcs functional depends , besides the temperature @xmath1 and the chemical potential @xmath2 , on the interaction potential @xmath3 , the momentum distribution @xmath4 and the cooper pair wave function @xmath5 . a non - vanishing @xmath5 implies a macroscopic coherence of the particles involved , i.e. , the formation of a condensate of cooper pairs .",
    "this motivates the characterization of a superfluid phase by the existence of a minimizer of the bcs functional for which @xmath6 .",
    "a rigorous treatment of the bcs functional was presented in @xcite , where the question was addressed for which interaction potentials @xmath3 and at which temperatures @xmath1 a superfluid phase exists . in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the question to what extent it is justifiable to dismiss the direct and exchange terms in the energy .",
    "a heuristic justification was given in @xcite , where it was argued that as long as the range of the interaction potential is suitably small , the only effect of the direct and exchange terms is to renormalize the chemical potential .",
    "in this paper we derive a gap equation for the extended theory with direct and exchange terms and investigate the existence of non - trivial solutions for general interaction potentials .",
    "we give a rigorous justification for dismissing the two terms for potentials whose range @xmath7 is short compared to the scattering length @xmath8 and the fermi wave length @xmath9 .",
    "the potentials are required to have a suitable repulsive core to assure stability of the system .",
    "we show that , for small enough @xmath7 , the system still can be described by the conventional bcs equation if the chemical potential is renormalized appropriately . in the limit @xmath10",
    ", the spectral gap function @xmath11 converges to a constant function and we recover the bcs equation in its form found in the physics literature .    while we do not prove that for fixed , finite @xmath7 there exists a critical temperature @xmath12 such that superfluidity occurs if and only if @xmath13 , we find bounds @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that @xmath16 implies superfluidity and @xmath17 excludes superfluidity .",
    "moreover , in the limit @xmath18 the two bounds converge to the same temperature , @xmath19 , which can be determined by the usual bcs gap equation .",
    "the situation is illustrated in the following sketch .",
    "[ fig1 ]     we note that similar models as the one considered in our paper are sometimes referred to as bogoliubov - hartree - fock theory and have been studied previously mainly with newtonian interactions , modeling stars , and without the restriction to translation - invariant states @xcite .",

    "it was confirmed numerically for the newton model and also for models with short range interaction in @xcite .",
    "hence the present work represents the first proof of existence of pairing in a translation - invariant bogoliubov - hartree - fock model in the continuum . for the hubbard model at half filling this was shown earlier in @xcite .",

    "we assume @xmath3 to be reflection - symmetric , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "the state of the system is described by two functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , which are conveniently combined into a @xmath27 matrix @xmath28 required to satisfy @xmath29 at every point @xmath30 . the function @xmath31 is interpreted as the momentum distribution of the gas , while @xmath5 ( the inverse fourier transform of @xmath32 ) is the cooper pair wave function .",
    "note that there are no spin variables in @xmath33 ; the full , spin dependent cooper pair wave function is the product of @xmath34 with an antisymmetric spin singlet .    the _ bcs - hf functional _ @xmath35 , whose infimum over all states @xmath33 describes the negative of the pressure of the system , is given as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the entropy of the state @xmath33 . here ,",

    "this completes the proof .",
    "in this appendix we shall show that the equations   define @xmath12 and @xmath678 uniquely . to start ,",
    "let @xmath679 be defined by its components @xmath680 and @xmath681 we clearly have @xmath682 and @xmath683 ( since @xmath684 by assumption ) .",
    "by dominated convergence , we may interchange the derivative with the integral and compute @xmath685 where @xmath686 .",
    "if @xmath687 , this is positive , since @xmath688 for @xmath689 .",
    "if @xmath690 , on the other hand , we can integrate out the angular coordinates and change variables to @xmath691 , respectively , to obtain @xmath692 since @xmath693 , it is clear that this sum is positive , i.e. , @xmath694 .      for fixed @xmath1 , we have @xmath697 and @xmath698 .",
    "hence there is a unique solution @xmath699 of the equation @xmath700 , for any @xmath701 , and @xmath699 is decreasing in @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the function @xmath702 is strictly decreasing , and hence the equation @xmath703 has a unique solution for @xmath622 in its range . in particular , @xmath12 is a strictly decreasing function of @xmath704 , hence a strictly decreasing function of @xmath8 for @xmath136 .",
