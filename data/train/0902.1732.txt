    ", we can discuss topological properties of sets of such trees .",
    "as before , @xmath214 is a path in a tree @xmath211 if all finite prefixes of @xmath215 are in @xmath211 .",
    "let @xmath216 both sets are known to be @xmath51-complete , although the membership of ub in @xmath51 is not obvious , and is the subject of one of lusin s theorems ( theorem 18.11 in  @xcite ) .",
    "wf and ub are also known to be inseparable by borel sets ( @xcite , section 35 , see also @xcite ) .",
    "now , it is not difficult to `` encode '' these sets as languages of labeled binary trees , which turn out to be recognizable by parity automata . in",
    "@xcite a continuous reduction of wf to @xmath217 was used to show that the latter set is complete in @xmath51 ( example  [ przyklad_rabina ] above ) .",
    "let @xmath218 it is easy to construct a non - deterministic automaton accepting this language ; one can also assure that this automaton is non - ambiguous , i.e. , for each accepted tree , has exactly one accepting run . from considerations",
    "above , one can deduce that the sets @xmath219 and @xmath220 are inseparable by borel languages .",
    "however , the language @xmath220 is not co - bchi .",
    "[ kontr_przykladzik ] the language @xmath221 is recognizable and analytic , but not bchi .    let us call a path with infinitely many 1 s _",
    "bad_. so the above language consists of trees that have either none or at least two bad paths .",
    "rabin  @xcite shows that the language @xmath219 ( no bad paths ) can not be recognized by a bchi automaton , by constructing a correct tree which by pumping argument can be transformed to a tree with _",
    "exactly one _ bad path ( mistakingly accepted by the hypothetical automaton ) .",
    "so this classical argument applies to the language @xmath220 without any changes .",
    "as we have argued in the introduction , this example somehow breaks the analogy between the class of bchi recognizable tree languages and that of analytic sets .",
    "it turns out that the topological complexity , and the automata - theoretic complexity , although closely related , do not always coincide .",
    "the automata - theoretic hierarchies , in particular the index hierarchies for non - deterministic and alternating tree automata , are studied because of the issues of expressibility and complexity .",
    "typically , the higher the level in the hierarchy , the higher the expressive power of automata , but also the complexity of the related algorithmic problems ( like emptiness or inclusion ) .",
    "once the strictness of the hierarchy is established  @xcite , the next important problem is an _ effective simplification _ ,",
    "i.e. , determining the exact level of an object ( e.g. , a tree language ) in the hierarchy .",
    "the problem is generally unsolved ( see  @xcite for a recent development in this direction ) . one may expect that a better understanding of structural properties of the hierarchy can bring a progress also in this problem .",
    "we believe that ideas coming from descriptive set theory , like separation and reduction properties , uniformization , or completeness , can be helpful here .",
    "the inseparable pairs of co - analytic sets are common in mathematics .",
    "natural examples include the set of all continuous real  valued functions on the unit interval @xmath222 $ ] which are everywhere differentiable together with the set of all continuous real  valued functions on the unit interval @xmath222 $ ] which are not differentiable in exactly one point , but as in this case , other examples usually reflect the same pattern of wf _ vs. _ ub ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . in contrast , our pair presented in section  [ para ] is very symmetric : the two sets are copies of each other up to a symbolic renaming .",
    "recently , saint raymond  @xcite established that the pair wf _ vs. _ ub is complete ( in the sense of wadge ) with respect to all coanalytic pairs in the cantor set . in the proof he uses an interesting example of another complete coanalytic pair , which exhibits certain symmetric properties .",
    "building on his results , in subsequent work , we show that the pair @xmath122 , @xmath121 , has an analogous completeness property .",
    "our example shows that the first separation property fails for the co - bchi class ( @xmath6 in the fixed - point hierarchy ) while , by rabin results  @xcite , it holds for the bchi class ( @xmath4 ) . by this",
    "we have also settled a missing case in a classification by santocanale and arnold  @xcite . however , these authors were interested in the _ relative _ separation property ( as explained in our introduction ) , as they primarily wanted to find if the _ ambiguous class _ @xmath223 can be effectively captured by @xmath12 .",
    "as this coincidence turned out to fail for @xmath10 , it is meaningful to ask if the status of the first separation property established for the bchi / co - bchi classes , continues to hold for the higher - level classes @xmath224/@xmath165 .",
    "that is , if two disjoint sets definable in @xmath224 can always be separated by a set in @xmath223 .",
    "( a similar question for @xmath165 , with expected answer negative . ) in our opinion , it is an interesting problem , which may challenge for a better understanding of the topological structure of recognizable languages above @xmath225 ."
