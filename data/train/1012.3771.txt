    "recent investigations into the evolutionary properties of galaxies have established that the distribution of galaxy colours exhibits a strong bimodality , separating red , quiescent early - type galaxies , with little ongoing star formation , from a blue sequence of star - forming spiral galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this bimodality can be interpreted in terms of star formation history and stellar mass content ( e.g. @xcite ) with the stars in the most massive galaxies having formed quickly a long time ago and less massive galaxies still forming stars today . the current star formation of a galaxy can be traced through its h@xmath0 luminosity as this emission gives a direct probe of the young massive stellar population @xcite .",
    "the galaxy and mass assembly survey ( gama ; @xcite ) , has to date obtained optical spectra for @xmath12 galaxies in the nearby universe ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "gama s deep spectroscopic observations ( @xmath14 ; two magnitudes fainter than the sloan digital sky survey ; sdss ; @xcite ) and wide - area sky coverage ( three 48 square - degree regions ) provide an excellent sample with which to analyse the current star formation rates of a large sample of galaxies , down to very low stellar masses .",
    "gunawardhana et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "have used early data from gama to establish that there is a significant increase in the number densities of h@xmath0-emitting galaxies at very low luminosities ( h@xmath0 luminosities @xmath15 w , @xmath16 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ) such that a schechter function is a poor fit at these luminosities .",
    "this has also been observed by @xcite with the smithsonian hectospec lensing survey .",
    "characterising the faint - end of the h@xmath0 luminosity function is important as both @xcite and @xcite have found that there is a broadening of the star formation distribution to extremely low star formation rates ( sfr ) in low - mass as well as high - mass galaxies from their analysis of h@xmath0-derived sfrs for galaxies within 11 mpc .",
    "the broadening of the star formation distribution in high mass galaxies is due to the cessation of star formation .",
    "however , the broadening for low - mass galaxies is an open question with two potential resolutions : first , that the cause of this range is due to a change in the dominant physical process that regulates star formation .",
    "these galaxies are generally low mass and such galaxies have shallow potential wells .",
    "they are therefore subject to many processes that are negligible in higher - mass systems .",
    "second , the possibility that , at low luminosities , the star formation rate is not being traced as closely by the h@xmath0 luminosity due to the existence of fewer young stars , meaning that the initial mass function ( imf ) is not fully sampled in these systems . @xcite and @xcite",
    "find that the h@xmath0 luminosity underestimates the sfr relative to the fuv luminosity in dwarf galaxies and that this could be the result of a steeper initial mass function ( imf ) for galaxies with lower sfrs , for which there is growing theoretical ( e.g. @xcite ) and observational evidence @xcite .",
    "in this paper we investigate the characteristics of the low h@xmath0-luminosity galaxies that comprise the upturn in the h@xmath0 luminosity function .",
    "we investigate their stellar masses to determine whether the low h@xmath0-luminosities are from low - mass galaxies with high specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ) or massive galaxies with low ssfrs and find that these are generally low - mass systems with high ssfrs .",
    "we examine how much of the increase in number densities seen at low stellar masses ( @xmath17 ; @xcite ) in the galaxy stellar mass function is due to these systems and find that they do not contribute significantly .",
    "we also use the wide area of the gama survey to investigate what environment these low star forming galaxies are found in and conclude that they are only found in low density environments .",
    "we describe the construction of the sample in section [ sect : data ] . in section [",
    "sect : properties ] we describe the observed properties , star formation rates and environmental density of the sample , and discuss our findings in section [ sect : discussion ] . throughout this paper",

    "all magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "we use a salpeter imf in our derivations of stellar masses and sfr for convenience but recognize that quantitative values may need to be scaled to a more realistic imf .",
    "the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey is using wide - field survey facilities to study galaxy formation and evolution over a range of wavelengths .",
    "gama brings together data from the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) , the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) , the very large telescope survey telescope ( vst ) , the visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) , the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap ) , and the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) and herschel space telescopes . to date",
    "@xmath12 galaxies in three 48 square degree regions of sky have been observed @xcite .",
    "here we use data from the first two years of gama optical spectroscopic observations undertaken with the dual - arm aaomega spectrograph @xcite at the aat .",
    "the gama input catalogue is described in detail in @xcite and the spectroscopic tiling of those sources in @xcite . in summary",
    ", spectroscopic targets were initially selected from the sdss data release 6 @xcite to galactic extinction - corrected , petrosian magnitude limits of @xmath21 mag in 2 fields and @xmath14 mag in 1 field .",
    "the input catalogue includes an explicit low surface brightness limit , to aid artefact removal , @xmath22 mag arcsec@xmath8 , where @xmath23 is the effective @xmath24-band surface brightness within the half - light radius .",
    "the targets were observed with the 580v and 385r aaomega gratings giving an observed wavelength range of @xmath25 and spectral resolution of @xmath26 fwhm .",
    "h@xmath0 is within the observed wavelength range to redshifts @xmath27 .",
    "the spectra are extracted with ` 2dfdr ` which undertakes a first - order curvature correction and flux calibration in order to accurately splice the spectra from the blue- and red - arms of the spectrograph .",
    "the spectra are then sky - subtracted following @xcite and redshifts determined with ` runz ` @xcite . in the first two years of gama data",
    "there are 81,274 gama redshifts with quality values @xmath28",
    "( i.e. regarded as a secure redshift ) .",
    "the standard strong optical emission lines are measured from each flux - calibrated spectrum .",
    "this is done assuming a single gaussian approximation , fitting for a common velocity and line - width within an adjacent set of lines ( e.g. h@xmath29 and the [ oiii ] doublet and separately , h@xmath0 and the [ nii ] doublet ) whilst simultaneously fitting the continuum local to the set of lines with a straight - line fit .",
    "we measure the limit to which our h@xmath0 fluxes are robust from a self - consistent error estimation of emission line fits @xcite .",
    "since the ratios of the fluxes of emission - line doublets are purely set by quantum mechanics , we use measurements of the [ oiii ] and [ nii ] doublet fluxes to measure the flux at which the ratio is no longer accurate to within 10 percent . for a single line",
    "this then translates to a flux limit of @xmath30erg s@xmath4cm@xmath8 .",
    "we determine the limit to which our h@xmath0 fluxes are complete ( i.e. @xmath32erg s@xmath4cm@xmath8 ) from the number counts of our measurements .",
    "we make no attempt to construct a complete , volume or mass - limited sample as in order to obtain a reasonable range in luminosity or redshift ends up excluding the low h@xmath0 flux systems that we are studying .",
    "instead we take advantage of the fact that we can detect systems to these faint levels to explore the nature of some of the most extreme systems in the gama sample .    a significant increase in the number densities of h@xmath0-emitting galaxies at very low luminosities",
    "is observed in the lowest redshift bin of the gama h@xmath0 luminosity function ( @xmath33 ; gunawardhana , et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "we therefore focus on galaxies within this redshift range .",
    "there are 13,228 gama galaxies with @xmath28 and @xmath34 ( henceforth referred to as the whole sample for the purposes of this analysis ) and of these , 9,623 galaxies have h@xmath0 fluxes above our flux limit .",
    "we also require that h@xmath29 is measured as it is necessary for dust corrections described later .",
    "as h@xmath29 is a significantly weaker emission line , we only require that h@xmath29 is measured , rather than imposing a flux limit , in order not to discard weak line systems @xcite . as we are studying the star - forming properties of this sample , we remove 707 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) following the diagnostic relationships from @xcite .",
    "these relationships rely on four emission lines .",
    "if we do not have measurements for all four then we use the two - line diagnostics .",
    "if we do not have both lines for the two - line diagnostic then the galaxy is classified as ` uncertain ' , but remains in the sample to prevent discarding weak - line systems . using the @xcite diagnostics",
    "only removes 4 galaxies from the final low - h@xmath0 luminosity sample and does not change any of our conclusions .",
    "this leaves a sample of 8,916 galaxies .    at redshifts below @xmath35",
    "peculiar velocities are a significant fraction of the measured recessional velocity .",
    "this can lead to distance errors of a factor of 2 or more when assuming pure hubble flow ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore important to include local variations from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) frame .",
    "we use the gama peculiar velocity corrections which are calculated by applying the @xcite multi - attractor flow model which provides a parametric model for the local velocity field , from @xmath36 ( below which stellar contamination arises ) to @xmath35 . from @xmath37",
    "the peculiar velocity corrections are linearly tapered to zero by maximising the probability density of the corrections , and above @xmath38 a pure @xmath39 is invoked .",
    "we calculate intrinsic galaxy luminosities using gama @xmath40 magnitudes measured in @xmath24-band - defined elliptical kron apertures @xcite .",
    "these magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction according to the dust maps of @xcite and @xmath41-corrected to a redshift @xmath42 using the kcorrect v4_1_4 code of @xcite such that @xmath43 ) - 25 - k_x$ ] .",
    "@xmath24-band magnitudes re - computed for gama are not available for 418 galaxies .",
    "these missing magnitudes are generally either due to a sextractor detection failure or a particularly low surface brightness source @xcite .",
    "this leaves a sample of 8,666 galaxies ( henceforth referred to as the main sample ) .      in order to calculate the h@xmath44 luminosity we first correct the observed equivalent width , ew(h@xmath44 ) , for the effects of stellar absorption within each galaxy , aperture effects from the @xmath45 fibres , and intrinsic dust obscuration .",
    "we adopt the method of @xcite for calculating total h@xmath44 luminosities from sdss fibre spectroscopy : @xmath46 ^ 2 }   \\times \\left(\\frac{s_{h\\alpha}/s_{h\\beta}}{2.86}\\right)^{2.36}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a constant correction , @xmath47 , is added to the balmer emission lines to correct the measured ew for internal stellar absorption .",
    "@xcite argued that a correction of @xmath48 was sufficient .",
    "however , an analysis of gama data indicates that results are quantitatively and qualitatively similar if the correction is between @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xcite and we therefore use the smaller correction in all analyses , @xmath51 .",
    "we correct for the difference in aperture size between the aat fibre ( @xmath45 diameter ) and the galaxy itself by using the absolute , extinction - corrected , @xmath24-band magnitude , @xmath52 @xcite , to approximate the continuum at the wavelength of h@xmath0 , with the implicit assumption that the h@xmath0 emission is traced by the continuum emission @xcite .",
    "the factor of @xmath53 ^ 2}$ ] converts from units of w hz@xmath4 to w @xmath4 , for the wavelength of h@xmath0 in a vacuum .",
    "emission can be heavily attenuated by dust .",
    "we therefore correct for dust extinction intrinsic to the galaxy using the balmer decrement , assuming an intrinsic case b recombination ratio of 2.86 for h@xmath0/h@xmath29 , ( s@xmath54 and s@xmath55 are the stellar absorption corrected line fluxes , see @xcite ) and the @xcite milky way dust correction for emission lines , giving an exponent of 2.36 .",
    "this gives a median correction factor of no obscuration correction for these galaxies , consistent with their low luminosities . from the main sample of 8,693 galaxies we select the least h@xmath44 luminous galaxies above the flux limit of @xmath30ergs s@xmath4cm@xmath8 up to the luminosity at which the upturn in the h@xmath0 luminosity function is observed ( @xcite , gunawardhana et al .",

    "the gama catalogue is derived from an automated procedure applied to sdss and ukidss @xcite . in certain cases sources",
    "were visually checked and given the classification vis_class @xmath59 if the object , such as an hii region , was part of a larger system .",
    "these are not included in our sample .",
    "in addition , we rejected a further 2 sources with stars less than @xmath45 away ( as the spectra are contaminated by those stars ) and 3 sources which were hii regions not previously identified .",
    "this leaves a sample of 90 galaxies with @xmath34 and sfr @xmath2 m@xmath3yr@xmath4 ( henceforth referred to as the low-@xmath60 sample ) .",
    "the redshift distribution of the low-@xmath60 sample with respect to the main sample is illustrated in figure [ z_lha_all ] .",
    "the effects of our h@xmath0 flux limit and h@xmath29 selection are also illustrated .",
    "we describe the physical and star formation properties of these galaxies in more detail in the next section .",
    "in order to understand the physical and star formation characteristics of these galaxies in more detail , we examine their optical spectra and multi - colour images . we show the optical spectra ( from the aat ) and multi - colour images ( from the sdss ) for two galaxies , illustrative of the low-@xmath60 sample in figure [ example ] .",
    "these clearly indicate that our selection criteria of low - h@xmath44 emission identifies diffuse , blue , emission - line galaxies .    in figure [ histos ]",

    "figure [ histos ] ( a ) emphasises the much larger distance scale probed by the gama sample .",

    "the gama data are clearly sampling lower luminosities than the majority of the nyu - vagc low - redshift galaxies .",
    "most are of a similar colour to the ` blue cloud ' of star - forming galaxies ( i.e. @xmath65 ) showing that these low - h@xmath0-luminosity galaxies follow similar colour relationships to more massive star forming galaxies .",

    "we examine the size of these galaxies in figure  [ rad_histo ] using the effective radius ( containing half of the flux ) from a sersic fit to the @xmath24-band data .",
    "these galaxies are remarkably compact with all having half - light radii @xmath66 kpc .",
    "this result is unchanged if we use the sdss r@xmath67 radius which measures the radius containing 50 per cent of the petrosian flux .    of primary interest to this analysis",

    "the distribution of stellar masses with redshift with respect to the main sample is illustrated in figure  [ z_mass_all ] .",
    "it is clear that our low l@xmath54 sample are very low mass at low redshifts but have increasingly higher masses at higher redshifts . in general",
    "we find that these galaxies have low stellar masses , however five have stellar masses @xmath70 .",
    "the median stellar mass of the low - h@xmath0 luminosity sample is @xmath71 , roughly that of the small magellanic cloud .",
    "this is a result of our flux limit , as will be seen in the next section .",
    "the galaxies that make up the upturn in the h@xmath0 luminosity function are of similar stellar mass to those that form the increase in number density seen in the galaxy stellar mass function at stellar masses @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "to examine the contribution of these low star formation galaxies to the upturn in the stellar - mass function we show the fraction of galaxies classified as having low - h@xmath0 luminosity as a function of stellar mass @xmath17 in figure [ mass_histo ]",
    ". as stellar mass decreases the low - h@xmath0 luminosity sample are an increasing fraction of the whole galaxy population and the low star formation galaxies form the largest fraction of the mass function at stellar masses @xmath73 . however , the small numbers of low - h@xmath0 luminosity galaxies mean that this is not statistically significant . at higher masses galaxies with higher star formation rates dominate the mass function .",
    "the upturn observed in the h@xmath0 luminosity function is not cleanly responsible for the upturn observed in the galaxy stellar mass density at the lowest stellar masses .",
    "we investigate the star formation histories of these galaxies with respect to their stellar masses in the next section .",
    "in  [ sect : intro ] we stressed the importance of star formation history ( sfh ) on the observed properties of galaxies .",
    "to first order , we can characterise the star formation history using the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) .",
    "it is defined as the ratio of the current star formation rate ( sfr ) to the stellar mass formed to date and is closely related to scalo s stellar birthrate parameter , @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the ssfr gives a measure of whether the current star formation activity is typical of the past star formation activity ( i.e. a constant star formation rate ; log(ssfr ) @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) , the current star formation rate is elevated over the past ( i.e. star - bursting ; log(ssfr ) @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) or is reduced with respect to the past ( i.e. quiescent ; log(ssfr ) @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) and has units of inverse time .",
    "previous analyses have shown that star forming galaxies preferentially lie on a ssfr sequence with mass , such that the ssfr of low - mass galaxies is higher than for high - mass galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies in the local volume are also observed to lie on the ssfr  mass sequence @xcite .",
    "we calculate sfrs from the corrected h@xmath44 luminosity using the relationship given by @xcite , i.e. @xmath81 . the ssfr ",
    "stellar mass relationship is shown in figure [ ssfr_mass ] .",
    "the ssfr consistent with a constant star formation history over a hubble time ( i.e. @xmath76 ) is indicated by the dashed line .",
    "the ssfr equivalent to our lower flux limit at the median redshift of our sample ( @xmath38 ) is indicated by the dot - dashed line .",
    "our sample selection effectively selects galaxies at the limit in the ssfr - stellar mass relationship .",
    "however , the range of masses encompassed by our sample results in a range of ssfr , consistent with a range of star formation histories from quiescent to bursty , depending on their stellar mass .",
    "our flux limit prevents us from observing galaxies with lower ssfr , however , h@xmath0 imaging surveys observe galaxies with ssfr below our flux limit at these masses ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the range of sfh present for these galaxies is therefore likely to be larger than the distribution we observe at the lowest stellar masses we probe .",
    "it is also likely that there are more massive galaxies with similarly low star formation rates , as have been observed by galex ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that a simple relationship between ssfr and mass may be less warranted and may require more examination of the selection effects involved ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "studies examining the distribution of h@xmath0 luminosity ( or ew(h@xmath0 ) ) with environment find that the relative proportions of galaxies with high h@xmath0 luminosities depend on their environment , with more galaxies having high h@xmath0 luminosities in less dense environments than in more dense environments @xcite .",
    "the depth and area of the gama survey mean that we can estimate whether the environment of the lowest h@xmath0 luminosity galaxies is responsible for the range of star formation histories we observe .",
    "we restrict the magnitude - limited whole sample to the redshift range @xmath82 , guaranteeing that all galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath83 are volume limited .",
    "we then calculate the distance for all galaxies in our sample to the nth nearest member of the volume - limited ` density defining population ' ( ddp ; @xcite ) , such that we do not over or underestimate the density for each galaxy as the redshift increases . if the distance to the nearest neighbour is greater than that to the survey edge then the area used to calculate the density is that within a chord crossing the circle @xcite .",
    "in order to get a measurement of density for as many of the low h@xmath0 luminosity sample as possible , we examine the distance to the 1st nearest neighbour brighter than @xmath84 mag within a velocity cylinder of @xmath85kms@xmath4 and obtain density measurements for 59 of our 90 low - h@xmath0 luminosity galaxies . by reducing the nearest neighbour requirement from more usual numbers of 3 - 10 we get estimates of densities for a larger proportion of our sample",
    "while these measurements are less robust , they support the results we obtain for 3rd nearest neighbour measurements , which can only be made for 32 of our sample .",
    "the 31 galaxies for which we can not obtain density measurements are at redshifts @xmath86 and do not have neighbours within the volume limited sample , suggesting that they inhabit even lower - density regions .",
    "we note that the conclusions we come to are not sensitive to the velocity cylinder length , the number of nearest neighbours or limiting magnitude used . in order to qualitatively compare the environments of the low - h@xmath0 luminosity galaxies to those of other galaxies we compare to all galaxies with the same stellar mass range .",
    "our results are unchanged if we only compare to passive galaxies in the same mass range .",
    "the lowest h@xmath0 luminosity galaxies are found in the lowest density environments we can probe with a maximum density of only @xmath87 galaxy mpc@xmath8 ( median density @xmath88 galaxy mpc@xmath8 ) .",
    "in contrast , the whole sample of galaxies are generally found in regions of much higher density , extending to @xmath89 galaxy mpc@xmath8 ( median density @xmath90 galaxy mpc@xmath8 ) .",

    "the population of galaxies that do not make it into our low - h@xmath0 luminosity sample , but which also exist at these low densities , are mainly star - forming galaxies with higher h@xmath0 luminosities than this sample .",
    "figure [ lha_dens](b ) indicates that the environmental density of the low - h@xmath0 luminosity galaxies is related to their stellar mass . for a given density",
    "the stellar mass is higher in higher density environments .",
    "there is only one low - mass galaxy in moderate density environments ( @xmath91 densities ( galaxy mpc@xmath92 ) .",

    "the fact that there are no low - mass , low star formation galaxies in high density environments ( density @xmath94 galaxy mpc@xmath8 ) suggests that the only way such low - mass , star - forming , galaxies can survive over a hubble time without being accreted , tidally disrupted or being starved of their gas supply is through residing in the lowest density environments .",
    "these observations are consistent with measurements of galaxy clustering : the correlation length of the two - point correlation function is observed to increase from less clustered low - luminosity blue galaxies ( @xmath95 ) to more clustered high - luminosity blue galaxies ( @xmath96 ) and even more clustered red galaxies in the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey @xcite and sdss ( using photometric redshifts trained on gama observations ; christadoulou et al . , in prep ) .    .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the properties of the lowest h@xmath0-luminosity galaxies ( @xmath1 w ; sfr@xmath2 m@xmath3yr@xmath4 ) in the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies make up the the rise above a schechter function in the number density of systems seen at the faint end of the h@xmath0 luminosity function . above our flux limit </S>",
    "<S> we find that these galaxies are principally composed of intrinsically low stellar mass systems ( median stellar mass @xmath5 ) with only 5/90 having stellar masses @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the low sfr systems are found to exist predominantly in the lowest density environments ( median density @xmath7 galaxy mpc@xmath8 with none in environments more dense than @xmath9 galaxy mpc@xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> their current specific star formation rates ( ssfr ; @xmath10log(ssfr[yr@xmath11 ) < -12.$ ] ) are consistent with their having had a variety of star formation histories . the low density environments of these galaxies demonstrates that such low - mass , star - forming systems can only remain as low - mass and forming stars if they reside sufficiently far from other galaxies to avoid being accreted , dispersed through tidal effects or having their gas reservoirs rendered ineffective through external processes .
