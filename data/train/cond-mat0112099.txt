    "phase coherence in metallic systems has been extensively studied since experiments suggested that the dephasing time , @xmath0 , seemed to saturate to a constant value at low temperatures@xcite , in apparent contradiction with the accepted theory@xcite .",
    "it has been argued that voltage fluctuations lead to a dephasing time consistent with saturation at low temperatures@xcite , although related calculations lead to different results@xcite ( see also@xcite ) .",
    "comparison between the different calculations of the dephasing time of low energy electrons in metals is obscured by the various approximations required to deal with the interactions and quenched disorder .",
    "the cause of dephasing , however , is the existence of a dynamic environment interacting with the electrons .",
    "a simpler situation is presented when the environment is different from the particles whose dephasing is being studied .",
    "even if that is the case , in a many particle system the environment induces interactions between the particles .",
    "thus , the simplest case when dephasing at low temperatures can be studied is that of a single particle coupled to an external dissipative environment . the problem can also be relevant to studies of quantum effects in heavy particles at metallic surfaces .",
    "we will study here he amplitude of the aharonov - bohm oscillations of the particle moving around a ring of radius @xmath1 threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath2 .",
    "this quantity provides information about the suppression of quantum interference due to the environment . we will not attempt to define a dephasing time . on the other hand",
    ", the dependence of the aharonov - bohm oscillations on the radius of the ring allows us to define , in certain cases , a length scale , @xmath3 , beyond which the oscillations decay exponentially or have a gaussian dependence on the radius .",
    "the simplest quantity which can be studied which depends on the flux is the free energy . at zero temperature , and in the absence of dissipative effects , the amplitude of the oscillations of the energy as function of @xmath2 is of order @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mass of the particle . the power law dependence of this scale on the length of the path of the particle can be interpreted as the absence of a typical length for the suppression of quantum coherence effects , at zero temperature .    in the present work",
    ", we estimate how this amplitude is changed when the particle is coupled to a dissipative bath .",
    "the next section presents the model used to analyze this problem .",
    "section iii discusses specific results for five types of dissipative environments : i ) the caldeira - leggett harmonic bath@xcite ( a closely related aspect of this model was analyzed in@xcite ) , ii ) dissipation with a periodic spatial dependence ( the dissipative quantum rotor@xcite ) , iii ) dissipation with a gaussian spatial dependence ( the dvd model@xcite ) , iv ) dissipation induced by a local coupling to the low energy modes of a clean metallic system@xcite , and v ) dissipation induced by the excitations of a dirty metallic system .",
    "section iv presents the conclusions .",
    "we assume that the degrees of freedom in the environment can be integrated out , leading to retardation effects in the equations of motion of the particle that we are interested in .",
    "these effects are best studied using the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "then , the action associated to each path of the particle , in the absence of a magnetic flux , can be written as : @xmath6 \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the mass of the particle , and @xmath7 is its position at time @xmath8 .",
    "the kernel @xmath9 includes the information about the environment and its interaction with the particle . at long times ,",
    "one has : @xmath10 where @xmath11 depends only on the spatial coordinates .    a simple choice is given by the caldeira - leggett model@xcite : @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the friction coefficient which describes the dynamics of the particle when @xmath15 .    two extensions of the kernel in eq.\\{[cl ] } are@xcite : @xmath16 } { \\tau^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ k ( x , \\tau ) & = & \\frac{\\gamma l^2}{2 \\pi \\hbar } \\frac{e^{- x^2 / ( 2 l ) } } { \\tau^2 } \\label{rotor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the first case , the macroscopic friction coefficient is @xmath17 . in the second case , @xmath18 is a length which defines the spatial range of the interactions mediated by the environment .",
    "when the coupling between the particle and the environment is weak , one can use perturbation theory . in this work , we will study the coupling of the particle to a metallic system by means of a local potential of strength @xmath19 and range @xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the coordinate of the particle , @xmath23 is the density operator of the electron gas , and @xmath24 if @xmath25 .",
    "this coupling leads to a retarded interaction along the path taken by particle . using second order perturbation theory ,",
    "this interaction can be cast as@xcite :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the density - density correlation function of the metal .",
    "the coordinate @xmath28 of the particle will be restricted to lie within a circle of radius @xmath1 , so that the motion can be also described in terms of the angle @xmath29 , as schematically shown in fig.[[fig1 ] ] . in terms of this angle",

    "the short range interaction is related to the energy scale @xmath34 .",
    "when studying the quantum rotor model in the context of mesoscopic junctions , this scale corresponds , at the same time , to the charging energy of the junction , @xmath35 , and to the upper cutoff in the spectrum of the environment coupled to the variable under study . in the present case ,",
    "the equivalent to @xmath35 depends on the radius of the ring , @xmath1 , and the two scales should be kept separate .",
    "thus , and following the conventional notation for tunnel junctions , the model in eq.\\{[periodic ] } contains two scales , @xmath36 , and an energy , @xmath37 , which defines the short time cutoff in the kernel in eq.\\{[asympt]}. we will assume that @xmath38 .    in order analyze the problem , we extend the renormalization group approach initially discussed in@xcite to the action in eq.\\{[periodic]}. we need to consider the scaling of the parameters @xmath39 , and , for completemess , we also consider the renormalization of the dimensionless coupling @xmath40 due to the high energy excitations of the environment .",
    "we lower the effective high energy cutoff from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , and rescale the dimensionless parameters @xmath43 and @xmath39 .",
    "ths leads to the equations : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are @xmath47 are constants of order unity .",
    "the scaling equation for @xmath43 ceases to be valid when @xmath48 .",
    "the renormalization of the @xmath49 s is only significant when @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , the equations for the @xmath39 s must be halted when @xmath50 .",
    "we can write the second equation in \\{[rg ] } as : @xmath51    the equation which determines the flow of @xmath43 shows two regimes , depending on whether @xmath52 is smaller or greater than one .",
    "when @xmath53 , the absolute value of @xmath35 is not changed by the renormalization of the modes with energies between @xmath37 and @xmath35 itself . in this case",
    ", @xmath35 defines the cutoff of an effective theory where the only couplings left are the @xmath49 s , in a similar fashion to the usual case studied in@xcite .",
    "this is the situation which is most relevant to the calculations to be performed in the following .",
    "the effective low energy scale is the given by : @xmath54 \\label{ren}\\ ] ]    if @xmath55 , the renormalization of @xmath43 is determined by the coupling to the environment , and only when this coupling flows towards zero @xmath43 can approach unity .",
    "the scale at which @xmath48 implies that : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a contant .",
    "the contribution to the action from the magnetic flux threading the circle is a topological term , which can be written as : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the quantum unit of flux .",
    "this term enters in the effective action in the same way a gate voltage is included in the correponding problem of tunneling in a small junction , which has also been studied in the literature@xcite .",
    "it is known that the fluctuations in the free energy at low temperatures are determined by the renormalized value of @xmath60 . in the following",
    ", we will assume that the amplitude of the aharonov - bohm oscillations in the free energy of a particle moving around a ring are also determined by @xmath60 , as calculated using the scaling equations \\{[rg]}. this scale is given in eq.\\{[eren ] } or eq.\\{[eren2 ] } , where @xmath61 .",
    "the dynamics of a quantum particle around a ring , using the caldeira - leggett bath of oscillators as a model for the environment , has been considered in@xcite .",

    "we recover the quantum rotor in its simplest version . using eq.\\{[ren ] }",
    ", we find : @xmath64 the aharonov - bohm oscillations will show a gaussian decay as the radius of the ring is increased .",
    "thus , quantum interference effects are suppressed beyond certain length , @xmath65 .",
    "this suppression of the aharonov - bohm oscillations are in qualitative agreement with the vanishing of the landau diamagnetism of a particle interacting with a caldeira - leggett bath of oscillators in a magnetic field@xcite , at zero temperature . in the language used in@xcite",
    ", our results suggest that , in a conatant magnetic field @xmath66 , the properties of the system at zero temperature are a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the cyclotron radius .",
    "this gaussian suppression of the aharonov - bohm oscillations at zero temperature is consistent with the similar suppression of interference effects between time reversed paths discussed in@xcite .",
    "note that , as @xmath69 , the scaling equations , \\{[rg ] } are valid for large values of @xmath1 .",
    "we now consider the retarded interaction described in eq.\\{[rotor]}. the spatial dependence of the kernel allows for only one fourier component , so that the decomposition needed in eq.\\{[periodic ] } becomes : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the dimensionless constant in eq.\\{[rotor ] } , and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the period of the kernel .",
    "the parameter in eq.\\{[kappa ] } is @xmath74 .    using eq.\\{[ren ] }",
    ", we find : @xmath75 hence , the aharonov - bohm oscillations show the dependence on @xmath1 as in the non dissipative case , although the coupling to the environment leads to a finite reduction of the amplitude .",

    "the density - density correlation function of a three dimensional electron gas can approximately be written , at low frequencies , as : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the electron mass , @xmath85 is the fermi wavevector , and @xmath86 is the step function .",
    "the high energy cutoff is @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the fermi energy . the interaction term in the effective action , eq.\\{[sint ] } ,",

    "similar results can be obtained using the response function of the two dimensional electron gas .",
    "the qualitative features of the rpa response function used here are generic to the response of a clean electron gas , whose low energy excitations can be described in terms of landau s theory . finally , the results presented in this subsection remain valid if the local coupling between the particle and the electron gas is be replaced by a screened electrostatic potential .",
    "if we assume that the charge of the particle is @xmath101 and the charge of the electrons is @xmath102 , the expression @xmath103 in eq.\\{[phaseshift ] } has to be replaced by @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the fermi - thomas wavevector .      in this case , the susceptibility is given by : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath108 , @xmath18 is the mean free path , and @xmath109 is the density of states .",
    "this expression is valid for @xmath110 , and @xmath111 . in the following ,",

    "\\ii ) coupling by the coulomb potential .    in this case",
    ", one has to replace the product @xmath120 used previously by : @xmath121 where @xmath101 is the charge of the particle , and @xmath102 that of the electrons .",
    "the kernel which describes the retarded interactions decays as @xmath122 at long times .",
    "the spatial dependence of the kernel @xmath11 , as defined in eq.\\{[asympt ] } , becomes : @xmath123 setting @xmath124 , and performing the fourier tranform defined in eq.\\{[fourier ] } , we obtain :    @xmath125    the parameter @xmath79 defined in eq.\\{[kappa ] } is @xmath126 .",
    "the renormalization of @xmath35 is , in this case : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a constant of order unity .",
    "we have analyzed the aharonov - bohm oscillations in five specific models for a particle coupled to different models of dissipative baths . in most cases ,",
    "these oscillations are suppressed by a factor which can be written as @xmath129 , where @xmath14 is the macroscopic friction coefficient , @xmath18 is a length which characterizes the spatial range of the interactions induced by the environment , and @xmath128 is a constant .",
    "this factor is independent of the radius of the orbit , @xmath1 .",
    "this is the case , for instance , when the particle is coupled to a clean electron gas , where @xmath130 .",
    "however , when the environment is the caldeira - leggett bath of oscillators , the renormalization of the amplitude of the oscillations has a gaussian dependence on the radius of the circle in which the particle moves , and the suppression factor mentioned in the previous paragraph becomes @xmath131 .",
    "hence , quantum interference effects become negligible beyond a certain length , @xmath132 , where @xmath14 is the friction coefficient .",
    "a less divergent suppression is also found for a charged particle coupled to a dirty electron gas , where the dependence of the aharonov - bohm amplitudes is a power law , although different from the value obtained in the absence of the environment .",
    "this diverse behavior in different models arises from the spatial range of the retarded interaction induced by the environment .",
    "this difference is lost in the classical limit , which is attained at sufficiently high temperatures . when the thermal length , @xmath133 , is much shorter than the range of the retarded interaction , the effects of the environment",
    "can be expressed in terms of an effective friction coefficient , provided that the interaction in time decays as @xmath122 at zero temperature , as in most cases considered here .    the suppression of interference effects , when it exists , is due to the formation of a screening cloud around the particle , with contributions from the high energy modes of the environment .",
    "the effect can be cast in terms of the existence of a franck - condon overlap factor which suppresses quantum interference effects@xcite .",
    "this factor can depend on the length of the path of the particle around the magnetic flux , leading to the suppression of the aharonov - bohm oscillations .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the fact that the same renormalization enters in the effective mass of the particle .",
    "the conductance can be defined as a function of the sensitivity of the ground state energy to a magnetic flux@xcite .",
    "hence , the franck - condon factor discussed here also reduces the conductance .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the divergence of the renormalization of the effective mass which appears with the suppression of the aharonov - bohm oscillations implies a qualitative change in the propagator of the particle .",
    "the `` quasiparticle peak \" at zero momentum , which characterizes the propagator of a free particle in the ground state , is replaced by an incoherent background .",
