    "the discovery of corot-7 b ( lger , rouan , schneider 2009 ; hereafter lrs09 ) heralds a new era in the study of exoplanets .",
    "the detection of rocky exoplanets has been a prime objective of exoplanet surveys as they are the most likely environments to support life . with a radius @xmath3 ( lrs09 ) , and a mass of 4.8 @xmath4 ( queloz 2009 ) , this planet is likely rocky ( valencia 2007 ; fortney 2007 ; sotin 2007 ; seager 2007 ) .",
    "corot-7 b is clearly not habitable , being only 0.017 au from its host star , but understanding its origin and properties can inform future interpretations of rocky exoplanets with the potential to be habitable .",
    "considerable research has already explored the plausible properties of close - in `` super - earths '' , rocky planets with masses @xmath5 and semi - major axes @xmath6 au ( see gaidos 2007 for a review ) .",
    "such planets probably formed at larger distances and migrated in , although there exist several other formation mechanisms ( raymond 2008 ) . at very close distances ( @xmath7 au )",
    ", planets orbiting @xmath8 stars may experience enough insolation to partially melt the surface , producing a silicate vapor atmosphere ( schaefer & fegley 2009 ) . corot-7 b may be such a world with a surface temperature of order 2000 k ( lrs09 , valencia 2009 ) .",
    "these previous studies assumed the planet remains at a constant distance from the star .",
    "however , corot-7 b is so close to its star that its life expectancy is very short as tides cause the orbit to decay quickly , assuming a conventional value for the stellar tidal parameter @xmath9 ( jackson 2009 ) . on that basis",
    ", lrs09 inferred that the value of @xmath9 is unexpectedly large .",
    "alternatively , corot-7 b could be on the verge of spiralling down to the star , out of a large population of planets ( in many systems ) , many of which have already been destroyed , as discussed by jackson ( 2009 ) .",
    "it therefore remains uncertain whether the radiative heating has been intense enough , long enough to melt the surface .",
    "here we assess the possible orbital history and its implications .",
    "tides may also contribute to , and even dominate , the heating of the planet .",
    "if the planet s orbit is at all eccentric ( even if the eccentricity @xmath10 is @xmath11 so as to be extremely difficult to measure via radial velocity data [ butler 2006 ] ) , the planet s figure is flexed by the time - varying gravitational potential of the star .",
    "these tides on the planet transform orbital energy into internal heat , affecting its geophysics as well as contributing to orbital decay .",
    "if the orbit of corot-7 b is sufficiently eccentric , then the planet could be substantially affected by tidal heating .",
    "tidal heat alone could be adequate to make it a `` super - io '' , with a surface heat flux far exceeding that of jupiter s extremely volcanic moon ( barnes 2009a ) .",
    "this paper identifies the orbital circumstances , histories , and physical properties that lead to io - like volcanism ( a super - io ) and those that do not ( a super - earth ) .",
    "if corot-7 b orbited in isolation , then tides would quickly damp any primordial eccentricity ( lrs09 ) , and we might expect minimal tidal heating today",
    ". however , even small eccentricities ( those typically considered negligible ) could yield considerable tidal heating and have profound consequences for the geophysical state of this planet .",
    "we show here that if the planet is similar to the rocky bodies in our solar system and has an eccentricity even as small as @xmath12 , tides may generate more heat per unit surface area than on io",
    ". such an eccentricity can be maintained by perturbations from planet c , the @xmath13 planet that orbits at 0.046 au , but only if its own eccentricity is large enough . in many plausible cases",
    ", the tidal heating may be orders of magnitude larger . in @xmath14 2",
    "we discuss tidal theory , the two models for the surface temperature presented in lrs09 , and our n - body model . in @xmath14 3",
    "we show the possible orbital and thermal histories of planet b. finally , in @xmath14 4 we discuss the plausible range of physical properties that this planet has in the context of tidal evolution and tidal heating , and suggest that corot-7 b could be the first of many super - ios that will be be discovered by _",
    "corot _ and _",
    "previous investigations have considered the possible range of surface temperatures of corot-7 b ( lrs09 , schaefer & fegley 2009 ; valencia 2009 ) . here",
    "we review the two models of lrs09 : one in which the energy is uniformly distributed over the surface , @xmath15 and one in which there is no surface heat transport to the back side , @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the albedo , @xmath18 quantifies the effectiveness of heat transport , and @xmath19 is the effective temperature of the star ( 5275 k for corot-7 ) .",
    "we assumed @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( no albedo and no greenhouse effect [ lrs09 ] ) . in the next section we will couple these models , eqs .  ( [ eq : tgr ]",
    "[eq : tss ] ) , to the tidal evolution of b s orbit in order to estimate its surface temperature history .",
    "tidal theory is a notoriously complicated and uncertain field . with few examples of tidal evolution in the solar system as well as the long timescales associated with this phenomenon , firm observational constraints are rare ( see lainey for a recent example ) . for more complete reviews of tidal models , consult ferraz - mello ( 2008 ) or heller ( 2009 ) .",
    "here we employ a standard model that was developed to study orbital evolution of satellites in our solar system ( goldreich & soter 1966 ; see also jackson 2008a ; barnes 2009a , b ; greenberg 2009 ) . in this model ,",
    "a planet on a circular orbit migrates ( @xmath22 evolves ) at a rate @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the gravitational constant , @xmath25 is the planetary radius , @xmath26 is the stellar radius , and @xmath9 is the star s `` tidal dissipation function '' which encapsulates the physical response of the body to tides , including the love number . in order to constrain a planet s orbital history , we integrate eq .",
    "( [ eq : adot ] ) backward in time by flipping the sign .",
    "we use a timestep of 1000 years which convergence tests demonstrated resolves the evolution .",
    "we will use this equation to consider the past evolution of planet b s orbit .",
    "we will also consider the possibility that the planet has a nonzero eccentricity today in order to assess tidal heating , which is parameterized as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the planet s tidal dissipation function and @xmath29 is the stellar mass ( peale 1979 ; jackson 2008b ) . note that if the planet has a nonzero eccentricity , eq .",
    "( [ eq : adot ] ) will have an additional term , but for the small values we consider below , this change is negligible .    in order to assess the surface effects of tidal heating , we can compare our results with the processes and characteristics observed on planetary bodies in our own solar system .",
    "for comparison , heating rates must be scaled to account for the differences in sizes among bodies . because we are comparing effects at the surface , we consider the heating rate per unit surface area ( see williams 1997 ; jackson 2008b , c ) , the heat flux , @xmath30 , through the planetary surface . on io ,",
    "@xmath31 = 2 w m@xmath2 ( from tidal heating ) ( mcewen 2004 ) , resulting in intense global volcanism and a lithosphere recycling timescale of 142 to @xmath32 years ( blaney 1995 ; mcewen 2004 ) . on earth ,",
    "the heating comes from the radioactive decay of u and k and produces a heat flux of 0.08 w m@xmath2 ( davies 1999 ) , which is adequate for plate tectonics and some volcanism , which is modest relative to io .",
    "lger ( in prep . ) suggest the radiogenic heat flux of corot-7 b is @xmath33 w m@xmath2 .",
    "the actual scaling of geophysical processes among various sized planets is much more complex than can be represented by the single parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the internal effects will depend on , and modify , composition and structure .",
    "qualitative differences in heat transport , such as the roles of convection vs.  conduction , will make for complex diversity .",
    "many of these differences may scale as the heating rate per unit mass , for example .",
    "however , modeling these details would require complicated internal geophysical simulations which are beyond the scope of this investigation .",
    "here we assume that the surface heat flux @xmath31 gives an adequate first - order qualitative representation of surface effects .",
    "thus , we call planets `` super - ios '' if their flux exceeds io s value ( @xmath34 w m@xmath2 ) . otherwise they can be considered as `` super - earths '' ( jackson 2008c ; barnes 2009a , b ) .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : heat ] ) to make these distinctions in the following section .",
    "we also consider the perturbations from planet c which can maintain b s eccentricity in a manner similar to the mutual perturbations of the planets in the hd 40307 system ( barnes 2009a ) .",
    "we model the interactions with the n - body code hnbody , which includes general relativity precession .",
    "we assume the orbits are coplanar , with planet c s mass , @xmath35 ( queloz 2009 ) . for the remaining orbital parameters",
    ", we used the nominal values from queloz ( 2009 ) , except the eccentricity of planet c was chosen from the possible range @xmath36 .",
    "we integrated the orbital motion for @xmath37 years .",
    "then , for each case , using the average astrocentric eccentricity of b , we computed the tidal heat flux of planet b , @xmath38 .",
    "we calculate the average heating flux because the mantle ( if such a layer exists ) of corot-7 b probably can not respond to heating variations with timescales of thousands of years .",
    "we have not tested system stability numerically , but note that the above parameter space is hill stable ( marchal & bozis 1982 ; gladman 1993 ) , which implies lagrange stability as well ( barnes & greenberg 2006 ) .",
    "here we consider the past evolution of this planet in order to estimate how the surface temperature has changed .",
    "we consider a range of @xmath9 values from @xmath37  @xmath39 ( mathieu 1994 ; lin 1996 ; ogilvie & lin 2002 ; jackson 2009a ) , and integrate back in time over the past 2.5 gyr in order to cover the full age of the system , 1.2  2.3 gyr ( lrs09 ) . here",
    "we assume that @xmath10 has always been small enough that tides raised on the planet have not affected the orbital evolution ( note that this assumption assumes the least amount of migration ) .",
    "the evolution of the semi - major axis of planet b s orbit is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : heat ] . for low @xmath9",
    ", the planet could have begun nearly twice as far out , whereas if @xmath40 or greater , there has been little change .",
    "the actual value of @xmath9 remains uncertain .",
    "this evolution has important consequences for the surface temperature , as given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tgr ]  [ eq : tss ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : temp ] shows the possible histories of this quantity . for @xmath41 ( the lowest extent of the gray strips )",
    ", the planet has only recently reached the extreme temperature it has today ( the global average was 150 k cooler @xmath42 years ago ) .",
    "only if @xmath43 has the temperature been as great over the past billion years as it is now .      in this subsection",
    "we explore a range of orbital configurations permitted by the observations in order to determine which cases predict corot-7 b is a super - io and which predict a super - earth .",
    "we begin by applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : heat ] ) to find @xmath38 as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "we consider a plausible range of physical and orbital properties listed in lrs09 ( their tables 5 and 6 ) , with radii from 1.41 to 1.95 @xmath44 , and @xmath28 values from 20  1000 , consistent with observations in our solar system ( yoder 1995 ; dickey 1997 ; mardling & lin 2002 ; lainey 2009 ) .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : heat ] shows the possible values of @xmath38 as a function of its current eccentricity @xmath10 , assuming the nominal system parameters and @xmath45 .",
    "the dotted lines show a range of possible values given the uncertainties in @xmath28 and @xmath25 . for reference the current heat fluxes for the earth and io",
    "are also shown ( also note that the stellar energy flux at the planet is @xmath46 w m@xmath2 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : heat ] shows that , if @xmath47 and assuming nominal radius and @xmath28 values , the planet is experiencing at least as much tidal heating ( in terms of surface flux ) as io . for other plausible parameters , the critical value of @xmath10 could be as low as @xmath0 . based on the example of our solar system , which has much larger @xmath48 values",
    ", one would expect that b is indeed a super - io .",
    "however , without an external perturber , tides could have damped even a very large primordial @xmath48 below these values in only @xmath42 years .",
    "( even the effects of stellar oblateness , passing stars , and the galactic tide could not keep @xmath49 as tidal damping occurs . )    the most likely mechanism , therefore , for @xmath10 to be @xmath50 is through gravitational interactions with other planets in the system .",
    "so far only one other planet is known , so we consider its effects on planet b. the magnitude of @xmath10 will depend on the current values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , both of which are poorly constrained .",
    "we assume the orbit of planet c is inclined @xmath53 to the line of sight ( coplanar with b [ lrs09 ] ) , with a mass of @xmath54 .",
    "[ fig : driven ] shows the average heating flux @xmath55 , based on the average value of @xmath10 over the @xmath37 year integration , as a function of @xmath51 . if @xmath56 , then @xmath55 exceeds the threshold for planet b to be a super - io .    but could planet c have such a `` large '' eccentricity given the extreme tidal damping in this system ?",
    "the orbital circularization rate falls off as @xmath57 ( goldreich & soter 1966 ) , which might seem to suggest that c s orbital eccentricity would be damped relatively slowly .",
    "however , planets b and c are coupled through their secular interactions , so that the tidal damping of one may affect the other .",
    "planet c s orbit could be circularized quickly through its interaction with b , i.e. planet b essentially drains away c s excess eccentricity .",
    "therefore planet c alone may not be able to maintain b s eccentricity to the level required for it to be a super - io .",
    "we have shown how tides may revise previous interpretations of the physical properties of corot-7 b. consideration of tidal migration has important implications for the planet s surface temperature , and hence the possibility that the surface is ( partially ) melted ( schaefer & fegley 2009 ) . valencia ( 2009 ) argue that such a high surface temperature would lead to loss of the volatile inventory within @xmath42 years after formation",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] shows that such a supposition implicitly assumes @xmath58 . although the temperature difference could be only a few hundred degrees or less , we encourage future research into the surface and interior properties of corot-7 b ( and close - in terrestrial bodies discovered in the future ) due to insolation to bear in mind the tidal evolution of the orbit .",
    "previous interpretations of the surface properties of corot-7 b ( lger 2009 ; schaefer & fegley 2009 ; valencia 2009 ) have only considered the radiative properties of the star .",
    "we have shown that other stellar properties , specifically its physical response to tides , are at least as important ( at least on the dark side of the planet ) . in this case",
    "the range of plausible @xmath9 values permit a wide range of surface temperature histories .",
    "this result emphasizes the urgent need to determine @xmath9 values more precisely .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that a slight eccentricity in the orbit of corot-7 b can result in enough tidal heating for it to be a super - io planet ( barnes 2009a ) , even without taking into account surface melting resulting from stellar radiation .",
    "however , tides would quickly circularize the orbit without an external agent",
    ". perturbations from corot-7 c are a likely mechanism to drive the requisite eccentricity . depending on corot-7 c s mass and orbit",
    ", corot-7 b could be tidally heated to be a super - io or less heated so as to be a super - earth .",
    "crucially , these distinctions lie below the current detection limit for the orbital eccentricities , so either is possible .",
    "however , given their close proximities to the host star , tidal damping may be strong enough to circularize both orbits below the threshold to make b a super - io .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : heat ] , the uncertainties in @xmath10 are consistent with a tidal heating rate of greater than @xmath59 w m@xmath2 .",
    "such a large heating rate is unlike anything observed in our solar system , and would have dramatic effects on the internal , surface and atmospheric properties .",
    "regardless of the current eccentricity of corot-7 b , most models of planet formation predict that planets form with eccentricities of at least a few percent ( raymond 2004 , 2006 ; obrien 2006 ; morishima 2008 ) .",
    "therefore it seems likely that the planet was a super - io early in its history ( assuming it never had a large gaseous envelope ) , even accounting for tidal migration which implies formation was somewhat farther from the star than the current orbit .",
    "we have assumed that corot-7 b has been a terrestrial - like planet throughout its history .",
    "valencia ( 2009 ) point out that ablation could strip away many earth masses of gas within 1 gyr , but we have showed it used to be further out .",
    "we are currently examining mass loss with tidal evolution ( jackson , in prep . ) .",
    "if the planet began with a large gaseous envelope , many of the ideas presented here may require revision .",
    "tides play a crucial role in defining the characteristics of the atmosphere , surface and interior of corot-7 b. this planet is the first close - in terrestrial planet discovered , but the _ corot _ and _ kepler _ spacecraft are likely to find many more .",
    "mayor ( 2009a ) find that 30% of solar - mass stars have super - earth to neptune mass companions on periods of 50 days or less , marcy ( 2005 ) and cumming ( 2008 ) find that the mass - frequency distribution of exoplanets is a power law with slope -1.1 ( low mass planets are more common ) , and the geometric transit probability of a 10 @xmath4 planet orbiting a 1 @xmath60 star is @xmath61% . taken together these results suggest _ kepler _ , which is monitoring @xmath37 stars , should find at least 100 terrestrial planets with orbital periods less than 10 days . like corot-7 b",
    ", these planets can be strongly tidally heated .",
