    "the class of faint x - ray sources in supernova remnants ( snrs ) known as central compact objects ( ccos ) are characterized by steady flux , predominantly surface thermal x - ray emission , lack of a surrounding pulsar wind nebula , and absence of detection at any other wavelength .",
    "table  [ ccos ] lists basic data on the well - studied ccos , as well as proposed candidates whose qualifications are not yet well established .",
    "of the eight most secure ccos , three are known to be neutron stars ( nss ) with spin periods of 0.105 , 0.424 , and 0.112  s. spin - down has been detected for two of these , the 0.105  s pulsar in kes  79 and the 0.424  s pulsar  in the snr . for , the implied surface dipole field is only @xmath10  g @xcite , smaller than that of any other young known ns . in the case of , archival data allow two alternative timing solutions , with @xmath11 or @xmath12  g @xcite .",
    "it is natural to assume that ccos that have not yet been seen to pulse are isolated , weakly magnetized nss of the same class as the cco pulsars .",
    "where pulsar searches have been unsuccessful , it is possible that an even weaker magnetic field , a more uniform surface temperature , or an unfavorable viewing geometry , prevents detection of rotational modulation .",
    "the absence of pulsations from the youngest known ns , the @xmath13 year old cco in cassiopeia  a , has been used , in combination with fitting of its x - ray spectrum , to argue that it is covered with a uniform temperature , non - magnetized atmosphere of carbon , the product of nuclear burning of h and he @xcite .",
    "rapid cooling of the ns in cas  a , directly detected by @xcite , has been interpreted as evidence for neutron superfluidity in the core @xcite .",

    "when trying to measure a small @xmath3 using x - ray data , position and proper motion can contribute significant errors via three effects .",
    "the first is an instrumental property of the  ccds when used in continuous - clocking ( cc ) mode ( see section 3 ) ; the position of the pulsar must be known a priori to @xmath36 in order to determine the time of arrival of each source photon .",
    "the second consideration is the accuracy of the barycentric correction .",

    "this processing accounts for the hrc amp_sf electronic ringing distortions discussed by @xcite .",
    "the hrc detector is well suited to astrometry , with its processed pixel size of @xmath37 that oversamples the on - axis point spread function ( psf ) by a factor of 5 .",

    ", we also follow the ciao thread to characterize the hrc - i psf , but we adopt a simpler approach to measuring source locations , one that is not dependent on model fitting in the image domain .",
    "our method is guided by the following observations .",
    "first , the on - axis , symmetric image of the pulsar contains enough counts that a simple centroid calculation is a sufficiently accurate measurement of its position on the detector .",
    "second , star  a of @xcite , which lies @xmath39 from , is the only useful fiducial source for registering the x - ray image .",

    "x - ray position measurements of the two weaker , off - axis stars used by @xcite only add to the uncertainty ( as quantified below ) in the absolute astrometry .",
    "third , the few x - ray photons from star  a , and its broad off - axis psf , do not warrant a sophisticated image fitting technique .",
    "instead , we use a `` corrected centroid '' method , as described below .    to determine the source location of star  a in the x - ray images we start with the chart / marx simulation of the psf , as described in the ciao user webpages , for its respective locations on the focal plane .",
    "figure  [ starapsf ] shows the distribution of the counts from each hrc image and corresponding monte carlo psf .",
    "it is apparent that star  a is poorly sampled in the data , with total source counts in the range @xmath44 ( table  [ hrclog ] ) .",
    "the maximum number of counts per pixel is typically only @xmath45 , making forward fitting poorly constrained statistically , while sharp features in the model can cause systematic offsets .",
    "furthermore , the source is immersed in a substantial diffuse background from the  snr which , although it only contributes a few photons over the source region , adds uncertainty to the position measurement because of the small count statistics , especially when fitting over a larger area .    to sidestep these effects , the coordinates of star  a are first found from its centroid .",
    "photons were extracted from circular aperture of radius @xmath46 , chosen to minimize the background counts .",
    "this aperture encloses essentially all of the signal in that fraction of the psf with a finite probability of producing a single count during the observation .",
    "this measurement was made using the ciao tool _",
    "dmstat _ and is iterated to produce the final coordinates . however , while this results in a well - defined and statistically meaningful measurement , it does not account for the shape of the complex off - axis psf , whose orientation depends on the spacecraft roll angle ( which differs for each observation ; see figure  [ starapsf ] ) , or for the monotonic off - axis deviations introduced by the flat focal plane . to quantify these systematic effects we also measure the centroid of the simulated psf of star  a in sky coordinates in each image and compare it to the coordinates that were input to chart / marx for that psf .",
    "the difference constitutes the small , but critical correction to the centroid of star  a.    we estimated the uncertainty in the derived coordinates of star  a using a monte carlo method .",
    "we generated 500 realizations of star  a by sampling the psf using a random number generator to match the observed counts , and accumulated the centroid measurements to build up a distribution in right ascension and declination . to account for the observed background ,",
    "we included a random distribution of photons within the source aperture .",
    "the resulting ( gaussian ) width of the distribution of centroids is typically @xmath47 in each of the two coordinates ( see table  [ coordtable ] ) .",
    "these reproduce the expected `` standard error '' for a centroid , @xmath48 .",
    "we also simulated the uncertainties for the two other fiducial sources used in @xcite and find that their inclusion in the position determination would only increase the uncertainty on the final coordinates .",
    "the pulsar itself is a strong source ( see table  [ hrclog ] ) whose coordinates are precisely measured using a centroid calculation with uncertainty an order of magnitude smaller than those measured for star  a. because of the symmetry of its on - axis psf , no systematic correction is required for the pulsar .",
    "its coordinates are then adjusted by the difference between the optical and x - ray coordinates of star  a at each epoch to produce its final astrometric position in table  [ coordtable ] .",
    "fitting the position of the pulsar as a function of time then yields the proper motion .",
    "figure  [ pmfit ] shows the @xmath49 fit with constant velocity in each coordinate , and table  [ ephemeris ] lists the formal solution and quantities derived from it .",

    "the prediction was based on fitting the modulation in only three energy bands , using much less data , and differs somewhat from the new , resolved data having an order - of - magnitude more counts . in particular , the energy of the minimum modulation is lower ( 1.12 vs. 1.28 kev ) , and the form of the modulation is more complex than predicted .",
    "furthermore , the phase is seen to drift at lower energies and the transition is not as sharp compared to the antipodal case , in which the phase was statistically either 0.0 or 0.5 .",

    "the spectral analysis presented here uses exclusively the data collected with the epic pn .",
    "although background is much reduced in the epic mos , this instrument is less sensitive at soft energies , collecting 4.7 times fewer photons than the epic pn in the @xmath127  kev band .",
    "furthermore , much of the epic mos data were lost as the high surface brightness of the  snr frequently triggered an automatic shutoff of that detector .",

    "lastly , one acis image taken in timed exposure mode ( obsid 750 ) suffers from pileup , and was not used .    for the epic pn data ,",
    "the main technical issue is that the snr background exceeds the point source counts below 1  kev .",
    "surprisingly , the background intensity and spectral shape are both strong functions of spacecraft roll angle .",
    "this effect is made evident because the  data sets were acquired in two narrow ranges of roll angle roughly 180@xmath128 apart associated with their respective visibility windows , with the time divided nearly equally between the two .",
    "we checked all of our spectral results carefully for features that might be dependent on roll angle due to systematic errors in background subtraction .",

    "better support for a low column density comes from the  rgs spectra of several regions of the snr fitted by @xcite .",

    "the motion of the ns also extrapolates to the same center , but the distance traveled , @xmath352 , corresponds to an age of @xmath353  yr ( or @xmath354  yr for our proper motion of @xmath355 mas  yr@xmath2 ) .",
    "@xcite refer to these marginally contradictory measurements as independent , and choose to average them , giving the value 4.5  kyr listed in table  [ ccos ] .",
    "however , they are not truly independent , because they assume the same starting location .",
    "furthermore , the discrepancy is worse if the filaments have decelerated .",
    "just as the new  observations of the ns have improved the accuracy of its proper motion , we suggest that a contemporary observation of the optical filaments of  may improve the precision of the original @xcite study on which the optical proper - motion age is based",
    ". such an investigation could lead to a more detailed understanding of dynamics of the filaments , and a more accurate age for .",
    "the spin - down of power , @xmath356 erg  s@xmath2 , is consistent with being caused by magnetic braking of an isolated neutron star with a weak dipole field of @xmath357  g. its spin - down power is much smaller than its observed thermal x - ray luminosity , @xmath358  erg  s@xmath2 , which rules out rotation as a significant power source . as discussed in @xcite for , the very small @xmath3 disfavors propeller spin - down and accretion as a source of the x - rays .",
    "thus , residual cooling remains the most plausible source of the x - ray luminosity of  and , by extension , of all ccos .",
    "given the meager spin - down power of , we can also discount the suggestion of @xcite and @xcite that structure in the  snr and associated is caused by jets emitted by the pulsar , similar to the ss433/w50 system .",
    "parenthetically , if the morphology is not caused by the pulsar , then it does not provide supporting evidence of its distance .",
    "an unresolved question about  is the origin of its phase - dependent , possibly variable emission or absorption feature . in the absence of accretion",
    ", it would be difficult to understand how an emission line is generated , or why it would vary in a few years .",
    "the indication of variability is not strong , and there is no other evidence of accretion .",
    "therefore , we will consider here an absorption - line interpretation , for which there is a good precedent in , the only isolated pulsar to show a series of strong absorption lines in its spectrum @xcite .",
    "the spectral features in  are now widely considered to comprise the electron cyclotron fundamental at @xmath359  kev and its harmonics .",
    "the surface magnetic field strength where the lines are formed is inferred to be @xmath360  g according to equation ( 2 ) and assuming @xmath361 .",
    "the relative strength of the harmonics is explained by treating them as resonances in the photospheric free - free opacity in the presence of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "is exceptional in having the largest known spin - down dipole magnetic field among ccos , now confirmed as @xmath362  g. this is only slightly larger than @xmath360  g inferred from the spectral features , and is the first case in which such a comparison has been made between independent methods of measuring surface @xmath213-field on an isolated pulsar .",
    "effects that could eliminate the already minor discrepancy include the unmeasured proper motion , which would decrease the inferred spin - down dipole field , and the results of numerical models of a force - free magnetosphere , which imply a different spin - down law from the standard vacuum dipole expression @xmath363 such that , more accurately , @xmath364\\right)^{1/2 } = \\ 2.6 \\times 10^{19}\\ , \\left(p \\dot p \\over 1+{\\rm sin}^2\\alpha\\right)^{1/2}\\,{\\rm g}\\eqno(4)\\ ] ] @xcite .",
    "this means that a measured spin - down rate is obtained with @xmath77 smaller by a factor @xmath365 than the conventional approximation @xmath366  g.    in the case of , by the same logic , its weaker inferred dipole magnetic field of @xmath367  g would nt naturally account for a spectral feature at @xmath368  kev , instead predicting @xmath369  kev .",
    "the absorption model with the cyclotron fundamental at @xmath210  kev comes closer to the prediction .",
    "however , additional variables can affect the comparison of a dipole field inferred from spin - down with that from a cyclotron line .",
    "first is the factor of 2 variation of dipole field strength over the surface , with @xmath212 .",
    "second , the actual field is not likely to be a centered dipole , and may be larger than @xmath77 or @xmath370 in places where the line is formed .",
    "the asymmetric distribution of surface temperature on  already appears to require a complex magnetic field geometry , such as an off - center dipole or higher multipoles .",
    "third , the inferred spin - down field depends on the uncertain ns mass and radius as in equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "@xmath77 scales as @xmath371 @xcite , where @xmath372 from equation ( 2 ) . for an astrophysically likely @xmath373 , theoretical ns equations of state allow @xmath374  km , therefore @xmath375 .",
    "the spectroscopic @xmath213 is therefore uncertain by @xmath376 when we adopt @xmath207 , while the dipole @xmath77 is uncertain by the much larger factor of @xmath377 .",
    "( the gravitational redshift cancels out in their ratio . ) allowing for these uncertainties , it is reasonable to adopt the hypothesis that feature(s ) in the spectrum of  are due to the cyclotron process",
    ".    the continuum x - ray spectrum and pulse profiles of are indicative of antipodal hot spots of different areas and temperatures @xcite , which are difficult to account for if the magnetic field is weak .",
    "a related problem is the high pulsed fraction of 64% from  @xcite , a timing twin of .",
    "polar cap heating by any magnetospheric accelerator must be negligible as a source of surface heating in ccos , being only a small fraction of the already insignificant spin - down power .",
    "thermal x - rays from residual cooling can be nonuniform if there is anisotropic heat conduction in the star .",
    "the effect of different magnetic field configurations on heat transport in the crust and envelope of nss has been modelled , most recently by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . a toroidal field is expected to be the initial configuration generated by differential rotation in the proto - neutron star dynamo @xcite .",
    "one of the effects of crustal toroidal field is to insulate the magnetic equator from heat conduction , resulting in warm spots at the poles .",
    "the warm regions can even be of different sizes due to the antisymmetry of the poloidal component of the field @xcite , which is evocative of the antipodal thermal structure of . to have a significant effect on the heat transport ,",
    "the crustal toroidal field strength required in these models is @xmath378  g , many orders of magnitude greater than the poloidal field if the latter is measured by the spin - down .",
    "purely toroidal or poloidal fields are thought to be unstable in an initially fluid ns @xcite , although the toroidal field may be stabilized by a poloidal field that is several orders of magnitude weaker @xcite .",
    "we suggest the latter as a viable configuration for a cco .",
    "@xcite tried to model the pulse profile of with anisotropic conduction , and concluded that they needed a toroidal crustal field of @xmath379  g to produce its high pulsed fraction .",
    "even then , they observe , the shape of the modelled light curve does nt match the observed one .",
    "since the shape of the light curve is not reproduced , the surface temperature distribution of  and its physical origin are still not known .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite investigated ns surface emission patterns using a combination of star - centered dipole and quadrupole magnetic field components to model asymmetric pulse profiles .",
    "the behavior of  may ultimately be explained by similar models .",
    "it remains to be shown that if ccos can have field configurations that are strong enough to affect heat transport to the extent required , while not exceeding the spin - down limits on the external dipole field .",

    "they overlap with the supposed mildly recycled pulsars in this area @xcite . the characteristic age of 254  myr for is not meaningful because the pulsar was born spinning at its current period , as is the case for the other cco pulsars . if their magnetic fields remain constant , they will not move in @xmath33 space for @xmath380  years ( but see below ) . that ccos are found in snrs in comparable numbers to other classes of nss",
    "implies that they must represent a significant fraction of ns births .",
    "if  and  are typical ccos , the area around them in the @xmath33 diagram should be densely populated with `` orphaned ccos '' that remain after their snrs dissipate in @xmath381  years",
    ". why there are few ordinary radio pulsars and no older x - ray pulsars near their location is then a mystery , as emphasized by @xcite , which may indicate that radio luminosity is a function of spin - down power .",
    "there are not yet enough ccos to know whether they are intrinsically radio - quiet relative to ordinary and recycled pulsars , rather than unfavorably beamed .",
    "it is also possible that some ordinary radio pulsars with @xmath382  g are actually much younger than their characteristic ages , and may be orphaned ccos that could be recognized in x - rays . whether or not they are radio pulsars , nearby orphaned ccos should be detectable as thermal x - ray sources for @xmath383  years , similar to the seven  discovered isolated nss ( inss : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which , however , have strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the inss are kept hot for longer than ccos by continuing magnetic field decay @xcite , which would explain their observed abundance relative to the elusive orphaned ccos",
    ". it may be difficult to detect and/or recognize orphaned ccos if they cool faster than ordinary neutron stars .",
    "one effect that can accelerate cooling is an accreted light - element envelope , which has higher heat conduction than an iron surface @xcite .",
    "the newly discovered 59  ms pulsar  ( `` calvera '' ) , originally detected in the  all - sky survey , may be the first recognized example of an orphaned cco @xcite , pending a measurement of its period derivative .",
    "the isolated ns 2xmm j104608.7@xmath14594306 in the carina nebula @xcite has been suggested as another orphaned cco .",
    "it is possible that the weak magnetic field of ccos is causally related to slow rotation at birth through the turbulent dynamo @xcite that generates the magnetic field .",
    "( see @xcite for a review of possible mechanisms for the origin of magnetic fields in neutron stars . )",
    "if the dipole magnetic field @xmath77 is simply related to the initial spin period , and assuming that the present period @xmath71 is in fact the birth period because the spin - down time is so much longer than the true age , we may expect an anti - correlation between @xmath77 and @xmath71 . with only three data points to compare , and with two of them having nearly identical values , there is not much evidence to examine for a trend .",
    "in fact , the cco with the longest period , , also has the strongest dipole field of the three , which would not by itself support such a simple correlation .",
    "a population analysis of radio pulsars by @xcite concludes that there is a wide distribution of birth periods , with a mean of @xmath384  ms and a dispersion of @xmath385  ms .",
    "if this is true , the birth periods of ccos are not in fact long , and their weak dipole fields may be the effect of some as - yet unknown parameter .    in an alternative theory for ccos , a normal ( @xmath386  g ) magnetic field",
    "is buried in the core or crust of a ns by prompt fall - back of supernova debris , and takes thousands of years to diffuse back to the surface , during which time the ns appears as an anti - magnetar .",
    "this is assuming that the accreted matter is itself not magnetized .",
    "the timescale for diffusion is highly dependent on the amount of matter accreted .",
    "according to @xcite , for accretion of @xmath387 , the regrowth of the surface field is largely complete after @xmath388  yr , but if @xmath389 is accreted , then the diffusion time could be millions of years .",
    "@xcite calculated that the neutron star in sn  1987a could have accreted @xmath390 of fallback material in the hours after the sn explosion , aided by a reverse shock from the helium layer of the progenitor .",
    "if so , it may never emerge as a radio pulsar .",
    "interesting support for the theory of field burial and regrowth is the absence of evidence for magnetic field strengths @xmath391  g in accreting high - mass x - ray binary pulsars , as inferred from their pulse periods and period derivatives @xcite .",
    "if intrinsic fields in the range @xmath392  g were common , equilibrium spin periods of @xmath393  s should be frequent in hmxbs , but they are not . if the nss in these systems are born in the same way as isolated pulsars , this could imply that birth fields are never so small ; instead , field regrowth has occurred in all cases after it was initially buried .",
    "one caveat here is that @xmath394 of hmxbs do not have measured spin periods , although there is no strong selection effect against detecting @xmath395  s.    @xcite has revisited the process of hypercritical accretion onto a magnetized neutron star , while @xcite made new calculations of the subsequent diffusion to constrain the magnetic fields of ccos at birth and the accreted mass , finding @xmath396 for the latter .",
    "these models are difficult to test using ccos , because it would involve measuring the braking index or the change of the dipole magnetic field directly .",
    "@xcite implied that the isolation of ccos in the @xmath33 diagram may be less problematic in this model because , as their dipole magnetic fields increase , they will evolve to join the bulk of the pulsar population . however , for the first @xmath381  yr , field growth can only move a cco vertically upward in the @xmath33 diagram , as the braking index has a large , negative value .",
    "orphaned ccos should still have periods of @xmath397  s and lie in a sparse region .",
    "for this reason , an important test for an example of field growth is to determine the @xmath3 of calvera , which will reveal if its dipole field is greater than that of  and .",
    "previous calculations of field burial and re - emergence for ccos were one dimensional .",
    "the first two - dimensional calculations for this purpose were recently reported by @xcite .",
    "they find that the accretion must be essentially isotropic to bury the field sufficiently to cause the required orders - of - magnitude reduction of the external dipole .",
    "if the accretion were instead confined to the equator or the magnetic poles , the reduction of the dipole component would not be significant enough to produce a cco . finally , it remains to be seen if the resulting surface thermal distribution during the cco phase can be made compatible with observed spectra and pulse profiles .",
    "@xcite briefly presented the temperature distribution from one of their models that produces hot polar caps at a time when the external dipole field is @xmath398  g. but even in this case , the temperature does not vary by as much as a factor of 2 over the surface , a range that would be required to match the properties of  and other ccos .",
    "measurement of the spin - down rate of the 112  ms  in was achieved using x - ray observations coordinated between  and , the resulting phase - connected ephemeris spanning 2.3 yr .",
    "we also measured the proper motion of the pulsar in  hrc images over 10.6 years .",
    "the proper motion makes a non - negligible contribution to the period derivative via the shklovskii effect , and the uncertainty in proper motion and distance limits the accuracy of the intrinsic period derivative to @xmath399 .",
    "the straightforward interpretation of these results is dipole spin - down due to a weak surface magnetic field of @xmath357  g , the smallest measured for any young neutron star , and nearly identical to that of the cco pulsar  in .",
    "a phase - dependent spectral feature in  can be modelled either as an emission line of energy @xmath400 kev , or as a cyclotron absorption line and its harmonic , with @xmath401  kev . for reasons that are not clear , it is stronger during the pulse - phase interval in which the continuum spectrum is softer .",
    "there is only marginal evidence for long - term variability of this feature . the local magnetic field strength in the area where the spectral feature is produced may have to be larger than the dipole spin - down value .",
    "the existing spin - down measurements for three ccos , including a definitive new result for , are compelling evidence that a weak dipole field component is the physical origin of the cco class in general .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the ccos which have not yet been seen to pulse have magnetic fields that are similar to or weaker than those of  and .",
    "otherwise , if their fields were stronger , their spectra should show cyclotron lines similar to  and ( possibly ) .",
    "deep x - ray timing searches of the remaining members of this class , to smaller limits on pulsed fraction , could still discover new pulsars and supply valuable data on their birth properties and evolution .    a remaining theoretical puzzle about ccos is the origin of their surface temperature anisotropies , in particular , the one or two warm / hot regions that are smaller than the full neutron star surface .",
    "the measured spin - down power is too small to contribute to this emission .",
    "continuing accretion is unlikely because of the small spin - down rates .",
    "it appears that any explanation will have to involve stronger magnetic field components in the crust , with toroidal or quadrupolar geometries , that do not contribute to the dipole spin - down torque . a physical model of thermal and magnetic field structure that self - consistently reproduces the spin - down rates , x - ray spectra , and pulse profiles ,",
    "is still needed .",
    "if it can be studied with better data , the details of the phase - dependent and possibly variable spectral feature from  may contribute to a more definite model of its surface magnetic field geometry",
    ".    the cco pulsars  and fall in a region of @xmath402 space that overlaps with what are assumed to be moderately recycled pulsars , but is otherwise empty .",
    "an understanding of the evolutionary status of ccos is critically dependent upon a search for their descendants , the orphaned ccos without snrs . some single radio pulsars with spin",
    "parameters similar to ccos may be orphaned ccos rather than recycled pulsars , and they may be much younger than their characteristic ages .",
    "x - ray observations of pulsars in this region may find evidence of their relative youth via surface thermal emission .",
    "the spin - down rates of orphaned ccos would reveal whether ccos have intrinsically weak magnetic fields , or if field re - emerges on a timescale of @xmath403  yr from a normal magnetic field that was buried by prompt fallback of supernova debris , as is invoked in some theoretical studies .",
    "such rapid evolution would lead to orphaned ccos that lie directly above ccos on the @xmath33 diagram but are still detectable as thermal x - ray sources .",
    "the radio - quiet pulsar calvera is a possible such candidate . whether or not ccos have buried fields , the paucity of radio pulsars with similar spin parameters is real and requires an explanation .",
