    "nonperturbative qcd poses significant challenges .",
    "primary amongst them is a need to chart the behaviour of qcd s running coupling and masses into the domain of infrared momenta .",
    "contemporary theory is incapable of solving this problem alone but a collaboration with experiment holds a promise for progress .",
    "this effort can benefit substantially by exposing the structure of nucleon excited states and measuring the associated transition form factors at large momentum transfer  @xcite .",
    "large momenta are needed in order to pierce the meson - cloud that , often to a significant extent , screens the dressed - quark core of all baryons  @xcite ; and it is via the @xmath1 evolution of form factors that one gains access to the running of qcd s coupling and masses from the infrared into the ultraviolet  @xcite .",
    "it is within the context just described that we have performed a simultaneous treatment of elastic and transition form factors involving the nucleon , delta and roper baryons in refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to address the issue of charting the behaviour of the running coupling and masses in the strong interaction sector of the standard model",
    ", we use a widely - accepted leading - order ( rainbow - ladder ) truncation of qcd s dyson - schwinger equations  @xcite and compare results between a qcd - based framework and a confining , symmetry - preserving treatment of a vector@xmath0vector contact interaction .",
    "a unified qcd - based description of elastic and transition form factors involving the nucleon and its resonances has acquired additional significance owing to substantial progress in the extraction of transition electrocouplings , @xmath2 , from meson electroproduction data , obtained primarily with the clas detector at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) .",
    "the electrocouplings of all low - lying @xmath3 states with mass less - than @xmath4 have been determined via independent analyses of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 exclusive channels  @xcite ; and preliminary results for the @xmath2 electrocouplings of most high - lying @xmath3 states with masses below @xmath8 have also been obtained from clas meson electroproduction data  @xcite .",

    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) is a theoretically - established feature of qcd and the most important mass generating mechanism for visible matter in the universe , being responsible for approximately @xmath19 of the proton s mass .",
    "a fundamental expression of dcsb is the behaviour of the quark mass - function , @xmath20 , which is a basic element in the dressed - quark propagator : @xmath21 = z(p^2 ) /[i\\gamma",
    "\\cdot p + m(p^2)],\\ ] ] and may be obtained as a solution to qcd s most basic fermion gap equation , i.e. the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) for the dressed - quark propagator  @xcite .",
    "the nontrivial character of the mass function arises primarily because a dense cloud of gluons comes to clothe a low - momentum quark .",
    "it explains how an almost - massless parton - like quark at high energies transforms , at low energies , into a constituent - like quark with an effective mass of around @xmath22 .",
    "dcsb ensures the existence of nearly - massless pseudo - goldstone modes ( pions ) .",
    "another equally important consequence of dcsb is less well known .",
    "namely , any interaction capable of creating pseudo - goldstone modes as bound - states of a light dressed - quark and -antiquark , and reproducing the measured value of their leptonic decay constants , will necessarily also generate strong colour - antitriplet correlations between any two dressed quarks contained within a baryon .",
    "although a rigorous proof within qcd can not be claimed , this assertion is based upon an accumulated body of evidence , gathered in two decades of studying two- and three - body bound - state problems in hadron physics .",
    "no realistic counter examples are known ; and the existence of such diquark correlations is also supported by simulations of lattice qcd .",
    "the existence of diquark correlations considerably simplifies analyses of the three valence - quark scattering problem and hence baryon bound states because it reduces that task to solving a poincar covariant faddeev equation depicted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : faddeev ] .",
    "two main contributions appear in the binding energy : i ) the formation of tight diquark correlations and ii ) the quark exchange depicted in the shaded area of the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : faddeev ] .",
    "this exchange ensures that diquark correlations within the baryon are fully dynamical : no quark holds a special place because each one participates in all diquarks to the fullest extent allowed by its quantum numbers .",
    "attending to the quantum numbers of the nucleon and roper , scalar - isoscalar and pseudovector - isotriplet diquark correlations are dominant .",
    "for the @xmath23-baryon , only the pseudovector - isotriplet ones are present .",
    "the quark@xmath24diquark structure of the nucleon is elucidated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : faddeev ] , which depicts the leading component of its faddeev amplitude : with the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath13 , computed using the faddeev kernel described therein .",
    "this function describes a piece of the quark@xmath24scalar - diquark relative momentum correlation .",
    "notably , in this solution of a realistic faddeev equation there is strong variation with respect to both arguments .",
    "support is concentrated in the forward direction , @xmath25 , so that alignment of @xmath26 and @xmath27 is favoured ; and the amplitude peaks at @xmath28 , whereat @xmath29 and hence the natural relative momentum is zero . in the antiparallel direction , @xmath30 ,",
    "support is concentrated at @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the strong diquark correlations must be evident in many physical observables .",
    "we focus our attention on the flavour separated versions of the dirac a pauli form factors of the nucleon .",
    "the upper panels of figure  [ fig : f1f2fla1 ] display the proton s flavour separated dirac and pauli form factors .",
    "the salient features of the data are : the @xmath33-quark contribution to @xmath34 is far smaller than the @xmath35-quark contribution ; @xmath36 on @xmath37 but this ordering is reversed on @xmath38 ; and in both cases the @xmath33-quark contribution falls dramatically on @xmath39 whereas the @xmath35-quark contribution remains roughly constant .",
    "our calculations are in semi - quantitative agreement with the empirical data .",
    "it is natural to seek an explanation for the pattern of behaviour in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : f1f2fla1 ] .",
    "we have mentioned that the proton contains scalar and pseudovector diquark correlations .",
    "the dominant piece of its faddeev wave function is @xmath40 $ ] ; namely , a @xmath35-quark in tandem with a @xmath41 $ ] scalar correlation , which produces @xmath42 of the proton s normalisation . if this were the sole component , then photon@xmath33-quark interactions within the proton",
    "would receive a @xmath43 suppression on @xmath44 , because the @xmath33-quark is sequestered in a soft correlation , whereas a spectator @xmath35-quark is always available to participate in a hard interaction . at large @xmath45 , therefore , scalar diquark dominance leads one to expect @xmath46 .",
    "available data are consistent with this prediction but measurements at @xmath47 are necessary for confirmation .",
    "consider now the ratio of proton electric and magnetic form factors , @xmath48 , @xmath49 . a clear conclusion from lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : f1f2fla1 ] is that pseudovector diquark correlations have little influence on the momentum dependence of @xmath50 .",
    "their contribution is indicated by the dotted ( blue ) curve , which was obtained by setting the scalar diquark component of the proton s faddeev amplitude to zero and renormalising the result to unity at @xmath51 . as apparent from the dot - dashed ( red ) curve , the evolution of @xmath50 with @xmath1 is primarily determined by the proton s scalar diquark component .",
    "as we have explained above , in this component , the valence @xmath33-quark is sequestered inside the soft scalar diquark correlation so that the only objects within the nucleon which can participate in a hard scattering event are the valence @xmath35-quarks .",
    "the scattering from the proton s valence @xmath35-quarks is responsible for the momentum dependence of @xmath50 .",
    "however , the dashed ( green ) curve in the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : f1f2fla1 ] reveals something more , i.e. components of the nucleon associated with quark - diquark orbital angular momentum @xmath52 in the nucleon rest frame are critical in explaining the data .",
    "notably , the presence of such components is an inescapable consequence of the self - consistent solution of a realistic poincar - covariant faddeev equation for the nucleon .",
    "it is natural now to consider the proton ratio : @xmath53 , @xmath45 , drawn in the lower - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : f1f2fla1 ] . as with @xmath54 , the momentum dependence of @xmath55",
    "is principally determined by the scalar diquark component of the proton . moreover ,",
    "the rest - frame @xmath52 terms are again seen to be critical in explaining the data : the behaviour of the dashed ( green ) curve highlights the impact of omitting these components .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      the electromagnetic @xmath56 transition is described by three poincar - invariant form factors  @xcite : magnetic - dipole , @xmath57 , electric quadrupole , @xmath58 , and coulomb ( longitudinal ) quadrupole , @xmath59 ; that can be extracted in the dyson - schwinger approach by a sensible set of projection operators  @xcite .",
    "the following ratios @xmath60 are often considered because they can be read as measures of the deformation of the hadrons involved in the reaction and how such deformation influences the structure of the transition current .    in considering the behaviour of the @xmath61 transition form factors ,",
    "it is useful to begin by recapitulating upon a few facts .",
    "note then that in analyses of baryon electromagnetic properties , using a quark model framework which implements a current that transforms according to the adjoint representation of spin - flavour @xmath62 , one finds simple relations between magnetic - transition matrix elements  @xcite : @xmath63 i.e. , the magnetic components of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 are equal in magnitude and , moreover , simply proportional to the neutron s magnetic form factor .",
    "furthermore , both the nucleon and @xmath23 are @xmath66-wave states ( neither is deformed ) and hence @xmath67 .    the second entry in eq .",
    "is consistent with perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite in the following sense : both suggest that @xmath68 should decay with @xmath1 at the same rate as the neutron s magnetic form factor , which is dipole - like in qcd .",
    "it is often suggested that this is not the case empirically  @xcite .",
    "however , as argued elsewhere  @xcite , such claims arise from a confusion between the form factors defined in the ash  @xcite and jones - scadron  @xcite conventions .",
    "in addition , helicity conservation arguments within the context of pqcd enable one to make  @xcite the follow predictions for the ratios in eq .",
    ": @xmath69 these predictions are in marked disagreement with the outcomes produced by @xmath62-based quark models : @xmath70 .",
    "more importantly , they are inconsistent with available data  @xcite .",
    "the upper - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nucdel ] displays the magnetic transition form factor in the jones - scadron convention .",
    "our prediction obtained with a qcd - based kernel agrees with the data on @xmath71 , and a similar conclusion can be inferred from the contact interaction result . on the other hand ,",
    "both curves disagree markedly with the data at infrared momenta .",
    "this is explained by the similarity between these predictions and the bare result determined using the sato - lee ( sl ) dynamical meson - exchange model  @xcite .",
    "the sl result supports a view that the discrepancy owes to omission of meson - cloud effects in the dses computations .",
    "an exploratory study of the effect of pion - cloud contributions to the mass of the nucleon and the @xmath23-baryon has been performed within a dses framework in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "presentations of the experimental data associated with the magnetic transition form factor typically use the ash convention .",
    "this comparison is depicted in the upper - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nucdel ] .",
    "one can see that the difference between form factors obtained with the qcd - kindred and ci frameworks increases with the transfer momentum . moreover , the normalized qcd - kindred curve is in fair agreement with the data , indicating that the ash form factor falls unexpectedly rapidly mainly for two reasons .",
    "first : meson - cloud effects provide up - to @xmath72 of the form factor for @xmath73 ; these contributions are very soft ; and hence they disappear quickly .",
    "second : the additional kinematic factor @xmath74 that appears between ash and jones - scadron conventions and provides material damping for @xmath75 .    our predictions for the ratios in eq .",
    "( [ eq : remsm ] ) are depicted in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : nucdel ] .",
    "the lower - left panel displays the coulomb quadrupole ratio . both the prediction obtained with qcd - like propagators and vertices and the contact - interaction result are broadly consistent with available data .",
    "this shows that even a contact - interaction can produce correlations between dressed - quarks within faddeev wave - functions and related features in the current that are comparable in size with those observed empirically . moreover , suppressing the dressed - quark anomalous magnetic moment ( dqamm ) in the transition current has little impact .",
    "these remarks highlight that @xmath76 is not particularly sensitive to details of the faddeev kernel and transition current .",
    "this is certainly not the case with @xmath77 .",
    "the differences between the curves displayed in the lower - right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : nucdel ] show that this ratio is a particularly sensitive measure of diquark and orbital angular momentum correlations .",
    "the contact - interaction result is inconsistent with data , possessing a zero that appears at a rather small value of @xmath78 . on the other hand , predictions",
    "obtained with qcd - like propagators and vertices can be viable .",
    "we have presented four variants , which differ primarily in the location of the zero that is a feature of this ratio in all cases we have considered .",
    "the inclusion of a dqamm shifts the zero to a larger value of @xmath78 .",
    "given the uniformly small value of this ratio and its sensitivity to the dqamm , we judge that meson - cloud affects must play a large role on the entire domain that is currently accessible to experiment .",

    "the appearance of a single zero in @xmath66-wave components of the faddeev wave function associated with the first excited state in the three dressed - quark scattering problem indicates that this state is a radial excitation .",

    ", the momentum - dependence of the magnetic transition form factor , @xmath97 , matches that of @xmath98 once the momentum transfer is high enough to pierce the meson - cloud ; and the electric quadrupole ratio is a keen measure of diquark and orbital angular momentum correlations , the zero in which is obscured by meson - cloud effects on the domain currently accessible to experiment . finally , the roper resonance is at heart of the nucleon s first radial excitation , consisting of a dressed - quark core augmented by a meson cloud that reduces its mass by approximately @xmath99 .",
