    "many models beyond the standard model ( sm ) include stable weekly interacting massive particles which could be constituents of dark matter .",
    "since the stability of these particles is generally related to some symmetry , they can be produced only in pairs at colliders , leading to challenging signatures with at least two invisible objects . at hadron accelerators like the large hadron collider ( lhc ) such",
    "a signal is not sufficiently kinematically constrained to enable the use of direct reconstruction techniques , and thus it is very difficult to uniquely determine the properties of the produced particles .",
    "one of the most challenging cases are processes with a low - multiplicity final state of only two visible objects , which is focus of this article .",
    "in particular we will consider the production of a pair of oppositely charged heavy new particles @xmath3 at the lhc , which each decay into a sm lepton and an invisible neutral massive particle @xmath4 : @xmath5 several methods for determining the @xmath6 and @xmath7 masses in processes of this type have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a number of authors have studied how to extract spin information from angular distributions @xcite and the total production rate @xcite , which are _ a priori _ unknown without model assumptions . ] .",
    "to the best knowledge of the authors , however , the problem of determining the couplings of the new particles , which are related to their gauge group representations , has not yet been considered .",
    "the goal of this article is to analyze the process in a more model - independent approach by considering all possible assignments for spins ( up to spin one ) and su(2 ) representations ( up to triplets ) for the particles @xmath7 and @xmath6 . to discriminate between these template model combinations ,",
    "we discuss several variables for the measurement of masses , spins , and interactions of the new particles , including two new spin - sensitive observables and one new observable for the coupling determination . to minimize model dependence ,",
    "the total cross section is not considered in this set of variables .    besides using dedicated observables",
    ", we also study an alternative analysis strategy based on an automated likelihood test .",
    "this method matches the observed lepton momenta in a sample of events to the corresponding momenta of a theoretically calculated matrix element in a given model and calculates a likelihood from that @xcite .",
    "note that the two approaches based on specific observables and on the automated likelihood test are complementary .",
    "the latter often reaches a higher statistical significance due to the fact that no information is lost by projecting onto some variables , but it does not permit a straightforward separation between individual particle properties , such as spin and couplings .",
    "after characterizing all relevant spin and coupling representations in section  [ setup ] and identifying 11 independent model combinations , we present observables for the measurement of particle properties in section  [ obs ] and demonstrate their usefulness in a monte - carlo study .",
    "section  [ mem ] is devoted to the analysis of the same set of template models with the likelihood test method .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in section  [ concl ] .",
    "the class of processes under consideration each involve drell - yan  type production of a pair of charged heavy particles @xmath3 , which each subsequently decay into a lepton @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and a neutral heavy particle @xmath4 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] .",
    "it is assumed that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 are charged under some discrete symmetry , such that they can be produced only in pairs and the lighter new particle ( @xmath4 ) is stable and escapes from the detector without leaving a signal .",
    "the observable signature thus consists of two same - flavor opposite - sign leptons and missing momentum : @xmath10[l]{$e$}/}\\,}$ ] . for this process",
    "it is insubstantial whether @xmath4 is self - conjugate or not .",
    "for the purpose of this work it is assumed that no other new heavy particles play a role in the s- or t - channel of the @xmath11 production process [ note , however , that if @xmath6 is a vector boson this assumption is not valid , as will be explained below ] .",
    "in fact , lhc data itself will be able to set a strong lower bound on such particles : searches for di - jet resonances could rule out s - channel resonances that couple to light quarks up to several tev , and any new particles in the t - channel need to be colored and thus could be produced directly with large cross sections unless their masses are larger than 23  tev @xcite . therefore , if the lhc does not see any such signals , one can safely neglect the presence of extra particles in the s- and t - channel for the production of @xmath11 pairs with mass of a few hundred gev .",
    "._list of different assignments of spin @xmath12 and su(2 ) representations for the charged field @xmath6 and the neutral field @xmath7 .",
    "we define @xmath13 to be the particle / anti - particle . also shown",
    "are the structure of the couplings to the @xmath14 boson and to sm leptons , as well as examples for realizations of these assignments in known models .",
    "mssm refers to the minimal supersymmetric standard model , ued to ( at least ) one universal extra dimension , and ued to ( at least ) two universal extra dimensions .",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 denote the superpartners of the right - handed charged lepton , left - handed charged lepton , neutrino , u(1 ) gauge field , su(2 ) gauge fields , and higgs boson , respectively .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively , are the first - level kk - excitations of these fields . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are scalars stemming from one of the extra components of the higher - dimensional gauge fields in ued .",
