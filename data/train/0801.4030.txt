    "recent x - ray studies have revealed that a number of known rotation - powered millisecond pulsars ( msps ) exhibit predominantly thermal soft x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the infered effective emission radii @xmath4 indicate that this radiation is localized in regions on the neutron star ( ns ) surface much smaller than the expected stellar radius ( @xmath5 ) but comparable to the classical radius of the pulsar magnetic polar cap @xmath6 .",
    "this finding is in agreement with theoretical models of pulsars , which indicate that the conditions in the magnetosphere of a typical msp favor heating of the polar caps to @xmath7@xmath8 k by a return flow of energetic particles along the open magnetic field lines ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "as this heat is restricted to a small fraction of the ns , study of the x - ray spectra and pulse profiles of msps can reveal important information about the star such as the radiative properties of the ns surface , magnetic field geometry , and ns compactness ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ) .",
    "this approach , originally proposed by @xcite in the context of radio msps , can serve as a valuable probe of key ns properties that are inaccessible by other observational means ( e.g.  radio pulse timing ) .",
    "as shown by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , a model of polar cap thermal emission from an optically - thick hydrogen ( h ) atmosphere provides an excellent description of the x - ray pulse profiles of psr j04374715 , the nearest known msp . on the other hand ,",
    "a blackbody model is inconsistent with the x - ray timing data and can be definitively ruled out .",
    "furthermore , there is compelling evidence for a magnetic dipole axis offset from the ns center @xcite .",
    "finally , the compactness of psr j04374715 is constrained to be @xmath11 ( 99.9% confidence ) .",
    "thus , modeling of x - ray data of msps appears to be a very promising approach towards answering long - standing questions regarding the fundamental properties of msps and nss , in general .",
    "the present paper represents an extension of the work described in @xcite .",
    "herein we explore the detailed properties of the msp x - ray emission model with particular emphasis on its use for constraints on the ns equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we examine the properties of our model ; in  3 we discuss an application of our model to archival x - ray observations of psrs j0030 + 0451 and j21243358 . in ",
    "4 we present a discussion and end with conclusions in  5 .",
    "the specifics of the theoretical model employed in this work are outlined in @xcite . in brief",
    ", the model considers a relativistic rotating compact star with two identical x - ray emitting hot spots , which in the case of msps ( presumably ) correspond to the magnetic polar caps .",
    "the position of each spot relative to the observer is given by the angle @xmath12 defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the pulsar obliquity ( i.e.  angle between the spin and magnetic axes ) , @xmath15 is the angle between the pulsar spin axis and the line of sight to the distant observer , and @xmath16 is the spin phase .",
    "we take a non - rotating schwarzschild metric as a description of the space - time in the vicinity of the ns and include doppler boosting and propagation time delays .",
    "this formalism is remarkably accurate as long as the spin period of the star is @xmath173 ms where rotation - induced oblateness is unimportant @xcite .",
    "the ns surface is assumed to be covered by an unmagnetized ( @xmath18 g ) , optically - thick h atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the angle - dependent emission pattern of this atmosphere differs substantially from the isotropic one of a blackbody , which is particularly evident in the rotation - induced modulations of the x - ray flux ( see fig",
    ".  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "using this model we generate both synthetic spectra and pulse profiles ( fig .",
    "1 ) for the following parameters : the effective temperatures and radii of the emission region(s ) @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath0 . unless noted otherwise , we fix the mass to the canonical ns value @xmath23 m@xmath1 and vary only @xmath24",
    ". we also allow for an off - center magnetic axis by including offsets in the position of the secondary hot spot in latitude and longitude , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , from the antipodal position .",
    "the corresponding net offset of the secondary hot spot from the antipodal position across the ns surface is is reckoned from the equator towards the spin pole . however , as defined by convention , the pulsar obliquity @xmath14 is measured from the spin pole towards the equator .",
    "thus , the correct expression for the seondary hot spot offset is given by equation ( 2 ) in this present paper . ]",
    "@xmath27\\ ] ] while the total displacement ( i.e. impact parameter ) of the magnetic axis from the stellar center is @xmath28 we conduct fits to both the spectrum and pulse profile . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "this is of importance because the spectral fits provide tight constraints on @xmath29 and @xmath4 but do not provide useful information regarding the system geometry or @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , the pulse profiles provide constraints on the compactness and geometry of the ns but are less sensitive to the parameters that define the emission spectrum ( @xmath29 and @xmath4 )",
    ".     plane for msps with @xmath30 ( _ solid _ ) , @xmath31 ( _ dashed _ ) , and @xmath32 ( _ dotted _ ) km assuming @xmath23 m@xmath1 .",
    "see figure 1 and text for a definition of each class.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]      in @xcite only point - like hot spots were considered , which was sufficient for application to the available data for j04374715 . here , we also consider more realistic extended hot spots in order to ascertain the effect of the uncertain physical size and shape of the hot polar caps on the observed pulse profiles . to accomplish this",
    ", we consider a grid of emission spots across the ns surface , which allows us to construct x - ray emission regions of arbitrary size and shape .",
    "figure 2 shows the resulting pulse profiles for two extreme cases : 1 .",
    "a uniformly heated , circular polar cap of radius 2 km and 2 .  a thin annulus ( with thickness much smaller than its radius ) also with a 2 km radius .",
    "the value @xmath33 km corresponds to the expected polar cap radius of a @xmath34 ms pulsar .",
    "surprisingly , the physical extent and exact shape of the emission regions do not significantly affect the observed pulse profile , and only differs from the point - like case by @xmath351% , except for class iv where it differs by as much as @xmath715% .",
    "the largest differences occur at the turning points of the lightcurves .    in reality , due to the rotation of the pulsar the polar cap shape is probably distorted ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with elongation or compression in the meridional ( north - south ) direction on the ns surface .",
    "however , even in such instances the differences from a circular hot spot with the same effective area are relatively small ( few % ) .",
    "this also means that for emission regions on the ns surface comparable in area to that expected for a circular pulsar polar cap , the x - ray pulse profiles do not provide useful information regarding the details of the region geometry .",
    "moreover , the weak dependence of the pulse profile on the polar cap size implies that the distance to the pulsar , which is covariant with the emission area through the flux normalization ( @xmath36 ) , does not significantly affect the pulse profile shape and pulsed fraction .",
    "thus , unlike alternative methods for measuring ns compactness ( e.g. , using quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries ) , fits to the x - ray pulse profiles of msps are not strongly affected by uncertainties in the distance .",
    "finally , figure 2 implies that the pulse profiles are weakly sensitive to broad - band calibration uncertainties in the detector effective area as well .",
    "narrow - band deviations from the true effective area of the instrument ( for instance , near absorption edges ) are also neglegible as the pulse profiles cover relatively wide energy intervals ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "note that the ambiguity in the exact shape of the polar caps may ultimately limit the accuracy of the constraint on the desires ns parameters using the approach described here .",
    "nonetheless , for the observed spectra of msps ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the effective radius of the hotter emission region is found to be of order a few hundred meters , which compared to the size of the star ( @xmath710 km ) is effectively point - like .",
    "thus , the uncertainty in the true shape of the emission region can be overcome by considering only the hotter emission component .",
    "it has been shown that combined x - ray spectroscopic and timing studies of rotation - powered msps can potentially be used to infer @xmath0 of the ns @xcite . here , we wish to determine whether with further improvement in data quality , @xmath0 can be determined to significantly better accuracy .",
    "this is essential if this method is to be used for reliable measurements of the ns compactness and ultimately the ns eos .",
    "in addition , it is important to ascertain how the viewing and magnetic geometries affect the constraints on the desired ns parameters . for this purpose ,",
    "we have carried out a series of fits to simulated x - ray data of msps with greatly improved photon statistics than currently available .",
    "a major advantage of the greatly increased data quality is the possibility of high signal - to - noise ratio energy - resolved pulse profiles in multiple energy bands and phase - resolved spectroscopy for several phase windows . as an illustrative example , we consider the current version of the proposed effective area curve of the _ constellation - x _ observatory x - ray microcalorimeter spectrometer ( xms ) detector and assume a range of exposure times , spanning from 250 ks to 1 ms .",
    "we generate representative lightcurves for each of the four distinct types defined by @xcite based on the visibility of the two antipodal hot spots ( see figs .  1 and 3 ) , assuming both @xmath30 km and @xmath23 @xmath37 , representative of strange equations of state , and @xmath38 km and @xmath23 @xmath37 expected from conventional nucleonic equations of state @xcite .",
    "class i pulse profiles occur in cases when only the primary hot spot is observable at all times , while the secondary hot spot is in the invisible portion of the star for the entire period ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "note that for two antipodal polar caps , this can only be achieved for @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 km for @xmath23 m@xmath1 ) since for a more compact star the entire stellar surface is always visible .",
    "the visibility of only a single hot spot causes large uncertainties regarding the true geometry and especially the compactness .",
    "this occurs due to the fact that that visible hot spot is always found at a small angle with respect to the line of sight where light bending effects are less pronounced , resulting in weak dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "as a result a given class i pulse profile can be reproduced by a fairly large set of combinations of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath0 .",
    "we find that this problem can not be overcome by deeper observations .",
    "indeed , for simulated deep exposures ( @xmath71 ms ) with _ constellation - x _ the @xmath41 confidence limits alone encompass the entire range of plausible ns radii ( @xmath42 km for an assumed 1.4 @xmath37 ) .",
    "therefore , this class of pulse profiles are not suitable for tight constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "pulse profiles that occupy region ii in figure 3 exhibit a single broad pulse per rotation . in this configuration ,",
    "the primary hot spot is observable at all times , while the secondary is only visible for a portion of the spin period .",
    "the thermal x - ray pulse profile of psr j04374715 @xcite appears to be in this class .",
    "figure 4 shows simulated observations of psr j04374715 , assuming @xmath38 km and @xmath23 m@xmath1 , with _ constellation - x _ xms and the corresponding best fit confidence intervals for @xmath24 .",
    "it is apparent that with a substantial improvement in photon statistics , @xmath24 could , in principle , be constrained to better than @xmath43% , and potentially down to @xmath723% ( at 90% confidence ) given sufficient exposure time .",
    "similar constraints are obtained for @xmath30 km and @xmath23 m@xmath1 as well . combined with an independent mass measurement from radio timing observations , this method could lead to unprecendented constraints on the ns eos .",
    "thermal x - ray lightcurves that are found in region iii ( fig .  2 ) are characterized by two pulse peaks per rotation period . the nearby psr j0030 +",
    "0451 is a good example of this class ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also  3.1 ) .",
    "an advantage of these pulse profiles is that each of the hot spots provides a dominant contribution to the flux of one of the two pulses .",
    "this feature has several practical consequences .",
    "first , it may , in principle , allow one to determine whether the two polar caps are identical in terms of size and temperature",
    ". any significant differences would point to deviations from a centered dipole , such as displacements of the dipole along the axial ( magnetic north - south ) direction or small - scale multipole contributions .",
    "moreover , the `` sharpness '' of the two pulses is strongly affected by @xmath0 ( see fig .  3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) resulting in increased sensitivity to the stellar compactness .",
    "thus , class iii appears to be favorable for tight constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "we find that a 1 ms simulated _ constellation - x _ observation of psr j0030 + 0451 permits constraints on @xmath0 down to a @xmath75% level ( at 90% confidence ) .",
    "finally , class iv profiles are formed when both hot spots are observable at all times . as evident in figure 1 ,",
    "these pulse profiles tend to have significantly lower fluxes relative to classes i - iii since the hot spots are observed close to edge - on for the entire spin period .",
    "these pulsars may not be observable at radio wavelengths due to the large impact angle @xmath44 , which may exceed the opening half - angle of the radio emission cone .",
    "such object can only be detected in x - rays . at present , identifying such objects as msps through x - ray timing is difficult without a known radio counterpart , although this may be possible with future x - ray observatories ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "these factors make class iv msps the most difficult to study observationally .",
    "most importantly , as seen in figure 2 , these lightcurves are much more sensitive to the size and shape of the hot spots .",
    "this introduces much larger uncertainties ( roughly an order of magnitude greater ) than for classes i ",
    "iii into the spectral and lightcurve fits , resulting in weaker constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "thus , class ii and iii pulse profile seem to be most favorable for tight constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "fortunately , these two classes occupy a major portion of the @xmath45 plane space . ] for the plausible range of @xmath0 , implying that most msps should fall in these classes . in @xcite",
    "we conducted a detailed study of psr j04374715 , a class ii msp . in  3 , we focus our analysis on two msps that exhibit class iii pulse profiles .",
    "as seen in  2 , for favorable geometries stringent constraints on msp parameters are possible .",
    "this suggests that even with fairly limited photon statistics some useful insight into the msp properties can be obtained .",
    "below , we illustrate this through application of our model to x - ray observations of two nearby msps , psrs j0030 + 0451 and j21243358 . along with j04374715 , these are the only thermal msps for which the x - ray pulse profiles are of sufficient quality to allow meaningful constraints on ns parameters , especially @xmath0 . the spectral analysis for each msp was performed in xspec 12.3.0 using the model described above .",
    "as shown in @xcite,@xcite , and @xcite , even the phase - integrated spectra of msp are significantly affected by the choice of @xmath14 and @xmath15 due to the energy - dependent limb - darkening of the atmosphere so it is necessary to consider them in the spectral fits as well . in order to apply the model to the x - ray pulse profiles",
    ", it was first convolved with the appropriate instrument response , the encircled energy fraction was taken into account , and the sky and detector background were added .",
    "the fit was performed by searching the @xmath46 hyperspace for the minimum .",
    "we fit the pulse profiles by considering the following parameters : the two temperatures and effective radii of each hot spot ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath21 , and @xmath49 ) the two angles @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the stellar radius @xmath24 , the offsets of the secondary hot spot from the antipodal position ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , and the hydrogen column density along the line of sight ( @xmath50 ) .",

    "1998 ) has postulated the presence of crustal `` plates '' on the ns surface formed by shear stresses on the crust caused by neutron superfluid vortex lines pinned to lattice nuclei ( see fig .  3 of chen et al .",
    "the motion of these plates would cause the magnetic fields of msps to migrate across the stellar surface , resulting in either an aligned magnetic field or one `` pinched '' at the spin pole .",
    "however , these configurations would result in very little ( @xmath35few percent ) modulation of the thermal x - ray flux due to the close alignment of the polar caps with the spin axis , regardless of the viewing geometry .",

    "in particular , the x - ray pulse profiles of psrs j04374715 , j0030 + 0451 and j21243358 indicate that the magnetic axes of these msps are significantly misaligned from the spin axis .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the dipole fields of these ( and likely all ) msps do not have a tendency to align with the spin axis nor migrate towards one of the spin poles .",
    "we have examined the properties of our model of thermal emission from hot spots on the surface of a neutron star covered by a hydrogen atmosphere , relevant for msps .",
    "our investigation has demonstrated that energy - resolved modeling of the thermal x - ray pulse profiles and phase - resolved spectroscopy of the continuum emission can , in principle , be used to determine @xmath0 and the pulsar geometry to high accuracy , given observational data of sufficient quality and favorable values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 . as shown in ",
    "2.1 the thermal pulse profiles are surprisingly insensitive to the details of the polar cap size and shape , the distance to the pulsar , and the uncertainty in the instrument effective area .",
    "this method represents the only feasible approach of studying msp magnetic field , surface properties , and compactness , especially for isolated msps . barring any deleterious effect such as additional hidden spectral components ( see , e.g ,",
    "* and references therein ) this approach can , in principle , lead to unprecedented insight into ns properties .",
    "our model is found to be in agreement with the observed emission from the nearby solitary msps j0030 + 0451 , and j21243358 . as with psr j04374715 @xcite",
    ", the relatively large pulsed fractions observed in psrs j0030 + 0451 and j21243358 require the existence of a light - element atmosphere on the stellar surface and can not be reproduced by a blackbody model for realistic ns radii . for j0030 + 0451 and",
    "j21243358 we are able to place interesting limits on the allowed compactness of @xmath73 km and @xmath96 km ( 68% confidence ) assuming @xmath23 m@xmath1 . based on our findings in  2",
    ", we expect deeper observations of this msp to lead to much tighter constraints on @xmath0 , which in turn may firmly rule out certain families of ns eos .",
    "the available thermal x - ray pulse profiles also provide useful constraints on magnetic field models of msps .",
    "specifically , the positions of the magnetic polar caps on the ns surface implied by the x - ray data indicate that the magnetic field closely resembles the conventional oblique dipole model of pulsars rather than more exotic field configurations .",
    "the success of this approach towards elucidating crucial ns properties motivates further studies of the nearby sample of msps with both _",
