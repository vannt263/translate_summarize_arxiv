    "galaxy evolution studies are reaching a high level of sophistication due to the very high quality of observational data permitted by modern technology , and the level of spectral details that such observations carry in ( just to name a few examples , the sloan digital sky survey - sdss - eisenstein al .",

    "2011 ) . in this era of _ precision astrophysics _ , interpretative models , such as stellar population and galaxy models , need to keep pace with the fast observational development .",
    "stellar population models allow the calculation of the integrated spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a synthetic stellar population - a star cluster or a galaxy - for arbitrary choices of parameters such as the age , the initial mass function ( imf ) , the metallicity , the star formation history , the horizontal branch morphology , etc .",
    "models are based on three ingredients , namely the stellar energetics , the stellar spectra - onto which the energetics are distributed - and the computational method adopted for calculating the integrated model . at given energetics , a model sed of higher spectral resolution",
    "is obtained by employing higher resolution stellar spectra . in this paper",
    "we present the higher - resolution version of the maraston ( 2005 ) stellar population models .    in the maraston ( 2005 ) models , the library of low - resolution , theoretical stellar spectra compiled by @xcite , was adopted .",
    "this is largely based on the classical model atmospheres of @xcite and a patchwork of different calculations for cool , m - type giants and dwarfs .",
    "the final assembly was further corrected in order to match empirical relations between stellar temperature and colours .",
    "the library does not contain thermally - pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) carbon - rich and oxygen - rich stars , for which in maraston ( 2005 ) the empirical , time - averaged spectra of c- and o - type stars from @xcite were utilised .",
    "a higher spectral resolution is required for a detailed modelling of emission and absorption lines .",
    "this is not the only necessary feature because element abundance ratios play an equally important role , but it is the first obvious step to resolve the lines properly . in turn , a high spectral resolution sed can be obtained either with theoretical or empirical stellar spectra .",
    "the two approaches have both pros and cons . while theoretical spectra give in principle high flexibility on the stellar parameter coverage ( temperature , gravity , metallicity ) and in the wavelength extension , known problems exist in the modelling of specific lines ( e.g. the @xmath3  line at @xmath4   , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as continuum regions due to line blanketing ( around the @xmath1  band , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and around the @xmath5  sdss bands ( * ? ?",
    "* see below ) .",
    "empirical stellar spectra have all lines that are observed in stars , but their intensity and flux ratios depend on the chemical enrichment history of the site where the star is found .",
    "moreover , empirical libraries usually cover a limited region of stellar parameter space and a limited @xmath6  range .",
    "hence , the approach of combining empirical and theoretical spectra is the most convenient one .    the first version of high - resolution maraston - type models was presented in @xcite , where fully theoretical , very high - resolution seds in the mid- and far-@xmath7  ( @xmath8 ) were published . at optical wavelengths , several empirical stellar libraries have been made available in the recent years , containing enough stars for nearly - complete stellar population models in a relatively broad wavelength range to be calculated ( the pickles library , pickles 1998 ; the jones s library , jones 1999 ; the stelib library , le borgne et al .",
    "2003 ; the elodie library prugniel & soubiran 2001 , and the miles library , sanchez - blazques et al . 2006 ) .",
    "stellar population models based on these libraries exist in the literature ( e.g. bruzual & charlot 2003 for the stelib library ; vazdekis et al .",
    "2010 for the miles library ) .",
    "our preliminary attempt with these libraries @xcite allowed us to improve upon a long - standing mismatch between the colours of _ luminous red galaxies _ in sdss and stellar population models based on theoretical stellar spectra @xcite .",
    "also , a few remaining problems with the broadband colours of stellar population models , such as the ( _ b - v _ ) colours of milky way gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be connected to the same origin , and we shall show in this article that this was indeed the case .",
    "in this paper we present the full grid of m05-type models for a number of these different optical empirical libraries .",
    "in addition , we also employ the theoretical marcs library for modelling the spectra of old populations with a high resolution up to the near - ir .",
    "we shall test the models with gcs data , and compare them with results from other authors .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ eps ] we recall the main features of the evolutionary population synthesis code and in section  [ libraries ] those of the empirical spectral libraries . in section  [ scaling ] we describe the implementation of the empirical stellar spectra in the synthesis code , and also the calculation of models based on high - resolution theoretical spectra .",
    "stellar population models are presented and amply discussed in section  [ sec : ssp ] including a comparison with the literature , while in section  [ sec : testing ] the model fit to globular cluster data is treated .",
    "a summary is given in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the foundation upon which these models have been built was thoroughly described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m98 and m05 , respectively ) . here",
    ", we present a brief recapitulation of those models .",
    "evolutionary population synthesis models assume a stellar evolution prescription , which in this case consisted of the isochrones and stellar tracks by @xcite for ages larger than @xmath9  myr and by @xcite for younger populations .",
    "sets of models have been also computed with the padova stellar evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "the theoretical fuel for the tp - agb phase - from @xcite - was calibrated with observational data .",
    "reimers - type mass - loss was applied to the red giant branch track in order to generate blue and intermediate horizontal branch ( hb ) morphologies as observed in milky way globular clusters , and also blue hbs at high metallicity .",
    "the synthesis technique exploits the fuel consumption approach  @xcite for calculating the energetics of post main sequence phases , i.e. the amount of fuel available for nuclear burning using the evolutionary track of the turnoff mass . in the m05 models ,",
    "the fuel is used as integration variable in post main sequence . for the main sequence ,",
    "the standard isochrone synthesis technique is applied , where the integration variable is the mass .    as for the stellar spectra ,",
    "the basel assembly @xcite of the @xcite library was employed for all evolutionary phases except the tp - agb , for which empirical carbon - rich and oxygen - rich stellar spectra were used @xcite .",
    "finally , the code structure is modular ( see maraston 1998 ) , i.e. the three ingredients - the energetics , the atmospheric parameters temperature and gravity , and the individual stellar spectral - are stored in independent matrices , which allows one to easily experiment on their differential impact on the final models .",
    "this structure was particularly useful to compute the models of this paper for which we only vary the spectral transformation matrix .",
    "four different libraries of flux - calibrated empirical stellar spectra have been considered , namely @xcite , elodie , stelib , and miles .",
    "a brief summary of the properties of these libraries can be found in table [ tab : libs ] .",
    "note that the values of t@xmath10 , log(g ) , and [ fe / h ] reported there are minimum and maximum values only , and therefore say little about the actual sampling of the parameter space .",
    "for example , in the miles library only three stars have a metallicity higher than [ fe / h]@xmath11 .",
    "the actual range interesting for population synthesis modelling is illustrated in figures [ fig : covpic]-[fig : covelo ] .    in table",
    "[ tab : libs ] we provide two values for the spectral resolution , the _ nominal _ one cited in the reference papers and the _ actual _ one as was determined by later works .",
    "for miles we found that the actual resolution of the library is somewhat coarser than the 2.3   stated in @xcite and @xcite and is instead 2.54    @xcite .",
    "this result has been independently confirmed by the miles group @xcite . for stelib",
    ", @xcite found that the resolution of the @xcite models is coarser than the resolution of individual stelib spectra , which is the library adopted in those models ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "the actual resolutions should be used .",
    "below follows a review of important features of each library , together with a description of any alterations we may have imposed upon the spectra .",
    "note that stars from the galactic bulge are not included in these libraries , and also not spectra of carbon- and/or oxygen - rich tp - agb stars . for the latter ,",
    "we use the same empirical spectra as in the m05 models ( see section 3.6 ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < ,",
    "< , < , < \" , ]      the pickles library @xcite differs from the other three in that it does not contain spectra of individual stars .",
    "rather , the author has vacuumed the literature for a versatile collection of stellar libraries and combined the various observations , in order to provide standard spectra for all normal spectral types and luminosity classes . because they are ( for the most part ) averages of spectra from several sources ,",
    "the pickles spectra should not be as affected by systematic and random observational errors , as a library containing single observations of each star using the same setup .     for the pickles library .",
    "superimposed are the 1 myr , 10 myr and 12 gyr isochrones from @xcite and @xcite , respectively.,width=317 ]    the library has exemplary coverage of evolutionary phases , see fig.[fig : evocov ] , from the coolest m dwarfs and giants ( t@xmath12  2500 k ) to hot o - type stars and supergiants .",
    "only solar metallicity models can be computed from this library , however , since there are not enough spectra to cover all evolutionary phases to a satisfactory degree for non - solar metallicities .",
    "the spectral resolution is r@xmath13 and the wavelength range is very wide , ranging from the far - uv ( 1150   ) to the k - band ( 2.5 @xmath14 m ) .",
    "the extension into the uv in the pickles standard spectra was accomplished using the low - dispersion _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( _ iue _ ) spectra @xcite . above @xmath151@xmath16 m ,",
    "about half of the spectra lack spectroscopic observations , and the author constructed a smooth energy distribution from broadband photometry here .",
    "this may imply that near - ir absorption features may not be well resolved . also note that , at these wavelengths , the m  giant spectra are synthetic .",
    "the effective temperatures of the pickles spectra were assigned by means of ( _ v - i_@xmath17 ) and ( _ v - k _ ) colour - temperature relations mainly from @xcite , and from @xcite for the m giants .",
    "no accurate metallicity calibration has been performed , other than sorting the spectra into solar or non - solar metallicity based on a recipe described in @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained roughly 250 stellar spectra of fairly high resolution ( @xmath18 fwhm ) and with good wavelength coverage .",
    "most spectral types and luminosity classes are included , with a fair coverage in metallicity .",
    "there is a deficit of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath19 .",
    "several spectra lack atmospheric parameter determinations , and many do not have complete spectroscopic observations over the entire quoted wavelength range .",
    "in addition to this , all spectra available to the public suffer from telluric contamination .",
    "we have circumvented this problem by simply interpolating over the most affected wavelength regions , more precisely 6850 - 6950  , 7580 - 7700  , and 8850 - 9050  .",
    "granted , this might not be the most aesthetically pleasing solution , and it is by no means a complete eradication of all telluric absorption features , but it acts as a warning beacon to users and ensures that no science can be done within said regions . the stelib library has previously been adopted for stellar population synthesis by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter bc03 ) , to which we refer for more information .",
    "these authors replaced the contaminated segments with theoretical kurucz spectra for stars cooler than 7000 k , and with pickles spectra for hotter stars .    upon inspection of the individual spectra of the stelib library , @xcite found an rms spread of 1.09  in starting wavelength and 0.00033  in wavelength dispersion . if not corrected for , this will cause the coaddition of any spectra into the sed of a stellar population to have a degraded resolution compared to the resolution of the individual stellar spectra , acting effectively as a velocity broadening .",
    "in addition to this , they also found an rms error of 11.4 km s@xmath20 for the radial velocities adopted by @xcite , and small systematic deviations in the wavelength scale , of no more than @xmath210.5  .",
    "both of these attributes will further add to the downgrading of the resolution of the stellar population model .    in order to rectify these problems with the stelib wavelengths , thus avoiding loosing valuable resolution ,",
    "we have applied small , non - linear shifts to the wavelength scale , derived for each individual stelib spectrum , by fixing the positions of eight strong absorption features , and use interpolation to obtain the wavelength shifts for all flux points in between .",
    "the spectra were then rebinned to our adopted scale of 3201 - 9296.5  in steps of 0.5  .",
    "the reason for straying from the 1  step - size is that we found that the rebinning was accompanied by a small , but non - negligible , smoothing of some absorption features , which could be made insignificant with a finer sampling .",
    "the majority of atmospheric parameters in stelib were taken from the @xcite catalogues of [ fe / h ] determinations , which are compiled from a vast number of different sources in the literature .",
    "these values have been complemented with additional t@xmath10 determinations from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "colour - temperature relations from the latter have also been used where available .",
    "several stars , that are also part of the elodie library @xcite , were given the atmospheric parameters listed therein , if no other values could be found . if more than one determination of a parameter for the same star was available , these were averaged , with a larger weight given to the most recent determinations .",
    "the miles library @xcite provides spectra for almost 1000 stars , covers most evolutionary stages  based upon what can be expected to exist in our galaxy  at all metallicities down to [ fe / h ] @xmath22 .",
    "only stars at the extreme ends of the temperature scale are lacking , such as giants cooler than around 3400 k , and young stars hotter than @xmath1526000 k. the resolution is high ( 2.54   fwhm ) , and the wavelength range is primarily confined to the optical ( 3500 - 7400   ) .",
    "values for all atmospheric parameters are taken from a large number of sources in the literature , but a careful attempt has been made to homogenise the different scales .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a detailed description of this procedure .",
    "when it comes to the effective temperatures , however , it should be noted that the reference system adopted for this calibration comprises only values within the range 4000 - 6300 k @xcite .",
    "this may imply that the temperatures of stars outside this approximate interval may not be as homogeneous , even if an effort is made at tying every temperature to the system defined in the above interval .    linking to the discussion in the introduction",
    ", @xcite published [ mg / fe ] abundance ratios for roughly 75 % of the stars in the miles library .",
    "the characteristic knee ( see their figure  1 ) , which signals the onset of enrichment from sn ia , occurs at [ fe / h]@xmath230.9 , below which the [ mg / fe]-enhancement lies fairly constant around @xmath240.4 , albeit with a large scatter .",
    "stellar population models incorporating miles spectra will therefore follow a similar abundance pattern .",
    "the same will happen with the other libraries in the metal - poor regime .",
    "compared to the original library of elodie echelle spectra @xcite , the latest version , elodie v3.1 @xcite , contains roughly twice as many stars and a slightly increased wavelength range .",
    "the latter is still rather narrow , spanning only around 3000  in the optical , which is not surprising considering the very high resolution ( r@xmath2510,000 ) .",
    "one may argue about the relevance of applying stellar population models of such high resolution to velocity - broadened galaxy spectra , and for this purpose alternative versions of the library with lower resolutions may be computed .",
    "there are , however , stellar populations in which velocity broadening is less prominent , such as dwarf galaxies and star clusters , that might benefit from such a high - resolution model .",
    "most stars in the elodie library have solar or near - solar metallicity .",
    "only 68 stars out of 1388 are listed as having [ fe / h]@xmath26 , which limits our ability to produce elodie - based models at low metallicity . in the original paper @xcite atmospheric parameters",
    "were derived using the tgmet method @xcite , or taken from the literature @xcite .",
    "colour - temperature relations from @xcite were also used .",
    "final parameter values were taken as averages of multiple determinations , giving lower weight to old references . in the latest version @xcite , these parameters have been updated using more recent publications .",
    "the stellar parameter determinations and flux calibration of the stars in the elodie library have also been assigned quality flags by the authors .",
    "we take advantage of this to create as reliable ssp models as possible , by allowing only stars with the highest quality of flux calibration to contribute , and in cases where two or more stars occupy the same location in stellar parameter space , choosing the one with the most reliable parameter estimations .",
    "some stars have also been observed multiple times .",
    "again , in such cases we chose the spectrum with the highest values of the quality flags .",
    "if there are two or more spectra of the same star and with the same quality flags we compute an average spectrum for this star , taking also the average of the stellar parameters .",
    "the stelib , miles , and elodie libraries have a few stars in common , which gives us the possibility to obtain some indication of the quality of flux calibration . in fig.[fig : starcomp ] we compare three stars of intermediate temperatures , chosen to represent a large range in metallicity and gravity .",
    "spectra have been smoothed to a common , low resolution of r@xmath27500 , and normalized to unity at 5050  , in order to make any differences in the continuum slope more clearly distinguishable .",
    "none of the stars are known to be a variable . as can be seen in the figure , for at least two of the stars there",
    "are surprisingly large discrepancies , hinting at the uncertainties involved in accurately flux calibrating a stellar spectrum .",
    "if the differences in flux calibration are due to systematics , these will also be transferred over to the seds of the stellar population models .",
    "clearly visible are the telluric absorption features in the stelib spectra around 6900  .        a careful description of the complex flux calibration process for the elodie spectra is given by @xcite .",
    "since this library is a compilation of archive spectra rather than being part of a specific observation programme , no standard stars have been observed .",
    "the instrumental response is therefore evaluated by comparisons to several other low- and high - resolution libraries , and the spectra are corrected thereafter . at 3900   the blue limit of the elodie spectrograph  the global efficiency of the instrument drops by a factor of 50 , which may compromise an accurate flux calibration in the blue end of the spectra .",
    "the flux calibration of the stelib stars was tested in @xcite by comparing synthetic photometry against published photometry in the lausanne database @xcite . the _ ( b - v ) _ colour is by far the one with the smallest rms dispersion , 0.083 mag , with no discernable offset",
    ". the _ ( u - b ) _ and _ ( r - i ) _ have the largest dispersions , which is due to inhomogeneities in the photometric systems , and the fact that the stelib stars do not have the required wavelength coverage for the _ u_- and _ i_-band filters",
    ". there appears to be a slight trend in the _ ( v - r ) _ colour , such that the reddest ( coolest ) stars appear somewhat bluer in the stelib library .",
    "it is argued by the authors , that this is most likely due to differences in the photometric systems .",
    "it should also be noted that these tests were performed on stars not corrected for interstellar reddening .",
    "all this taken together makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of the flux calibration in bands other than _ b _ and _",
    "v_.    the miles stars have gone through a rigorous spectrophotometric quality control @xcite .",
    "an internal consistency check , comparing several observations of the same stars , revealed that the random rms error affecting the flux calibration is around 0.013 mag for the _ ( b - v ) _ colour .",
    "an external comparison with the lausanne photometric database @xcite , showed a mean offset of 0.015 mag for _ ( b - v ) _ , in the sense that the miles spectra are bluer .",
    "the rms dispersion of 0.025 mag is considerably smaller than the one obtained in @xcite for the stelib stars . for stars in common with the stelib library , the miles _",
    "( b - v ) _ colours are , on average , 0.01 mag bluer , but with a trend that essentially all stars with t@xmath285600 k are bluer , whereas almost all stars hotter than @xmath157200 k appear redder ( see their fig.11 ) .",
    "the authors also defined seven box filters with effective wavelengths between 4000 and 6200   , in order to compare synthetic colours for stars in common with the stelib and elodie libraries .",
    "for all possible combinations of filters allowed by the wavelength range in common between the libraries , any statistically significant offsets show the miles stars to exhibit bluer colours . for colours involving the filters with the largest central wavelengths , there once",
    "again appears to be a trend of the coolest stars being significantly bluer in the miles library ( their fig.9 ) , whereas the situation is the opposite for the hottest stars .",
    "it is difficult to assess the flux calibration red - wards of around 6500  , since this portion of the spectra is more or less left out of the quality check .",
    "the trends summarised above will be mirrored in the ssp models ( cf .",
    "section  5 ) .      in this work",
    "we opt to retain the stellar parameters as they have been published by the authors of the various libraries , because our aim is to assess the joint effect of a library / temperature scale / stellar parameters on stellar population models , with the ultimate goal at understanding different results that are obtained on galaxies using different models .",
    "as discussed , the temperature scales are somewhat inhomogeneous , which may cause differences in the integrated stellar population spectra ( e.g. percival & salaris 2009 ) that can sometimes be hard to explain . for example , we could attribute to the adopted temperature scale for red giants part of the reason why the near - ir flux of miles stars drop longward 6000    ( see appendix a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a dedicated publication is required in order to homogeneise the different temperature scales .",
    "star numbers vary a lot between different libraries , hence a common scale built avoiding extrapolation could be worked out only for a subsample of stars , with the effect of reducing the stars available for population synthesis .",
    "colour of miles stars vs effective temperature.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    in order to get a sense for the effect of different temperature scales , we used miles , that contains more stars than the other libraries , and placed the stelib library on the miles temperature scale .",
    "this was achieved by measuring the @xmath2 colours of the miles stars at a given metallicity and fit a relation between @xmath2 and temperature . a miles - based temperature scale for stelib",
    "was then obtained by deriving the temperature of stelib stars using their @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting relation is shown in figure  [ fig : tescalestelibonmil ] . the effect on the stellar population model",
    "will be shown in section  [ sec : oldssp ] .",
    "the tp - agb empirical stellar spectra by @xcite used in the m05 code have a coarser resolution than most of the adopted libraries ( @xmath29 ) . for keeping the tp - agb phase in the new models",
    ", we have re - binned the tp - agb spectra to the sampling proper of the various empirical libraries . except for the pickles - based models",
    ", this implies that at the ages relevant to the tp - agb phase in the m05 models ( 0.2 to 2 gyr ) and at @xmath30  the actual resolution of the models will be slightly coarser .",
    "note that - because we have not downgraded the tp - agb spectra - there is an overall improvement in the definition of the carbon and oxygen - rich star spectral breaks in the integrated model compared to m05 .",
    "one of the main advantages of using theoretical spectra is that they can be computed to sample the stellar parameter space arbitrarily well .",
    "inserting them into a stellar population synthesis code is therefore relatively straightforward .",
    "when dealing with the more sparsely sampled grid of stellar spectra that are found in the empirical libraries , however , one has to use a slightly different approach .      in the m05 code",
    ", a stellar spectra is assigned to each [ t@xmath10 , log(g)]-bin by means of a quadratic interpolation in t@xmath10 and log(g ) at given metallicity .",
    "this approach is generally not feasible when empirical libraries are used , due to their coarser sampling of the parameter space .",
    "instead , for each empirical library we created different tables of stellar spectra , corresponding to the different evolutionary phases , i.e. ms , sgb , rgb , hb , e - agb , and supergiants . the categorisation was performed based mainly on the surface gravities and luminosity classes of the spectra , but other discriminants , such as visual inspection of the spectra , was used in uncertain cases .",
    "more specifically , the cuts in surface gravity that were applied for each respective evolutionary phase are : ms ( log(g)@xmath314.0 ) , sgb ( 3.5@xmath32log(g)@xmath324.0 ) , rgb , hb and e - agb ( 1.0@xmath32log(g)@xmath323.5 ) , and supergiants ( log(g)@xmath321.0 ) . these cuts",
    "are , of course , only approximate and depend somewhat on temperature as well ; it is not unusual for hot ms stars ( spectral class a or b ) to have surface gravities below 4.0 dex .",
    "spectra on the borderline between two evolutionary phases were therefore permitted to be present also in both corresponding tables .    within one evolutionary phase , the actual representative spectrum for each mass bin with its given temperature",
    "is then calculated by means of linear interpolation of the logarithmic fluxes in log(t@xmath10 ) .",
    "the number of stars assigned to each phase is never smaller than 10 .",
    "we have checked the stability of the procedure by using fewer or more stars and fixed the procedure when the results were found to be stable .",
    "note that the whole procedure is also checked at the bottom of the calculations by comparing the integrated models with other calculations based on theoretical stellar spectra or with literature calculations ( see section  [ sec : ssp ] ) .",
    "another difference between theoretical and empirical stellar spectra is the flux units . whereas theoretical spectra preferentially are given in absolute units , such as luminosity ( ergs s@xmath20 @xmath20 )  or any other unit that can easily be converted into luminosity ; the main point being it makes the population synthesis very straightforward ",
    "things are more complicated with empirical spectra . either fluxes are given as they were measured ( ergs s@xmath20 cm@xmath20 @xmath20 ) and thus dependent on the distance to the stars , as is the case with stelib and elodie spectra , or they have been normalised to unity at some wavelength , a method adopted in the pickles and miles libraries . in both cases ,",
    "the true relative energy scale between the spectra is washed out .    in order to be able to use a consistent approach for all the empirical libraries ,",
    "the following prescription was adopted .",
    "\\i ) we ( re-)normalize all stellar spectra to the average flux in a 100   passband around 5550  , as in @xcite .",
    "this choice is not crucial for the different libraries at different resolution because we use the average flux within the band .",
    "\\ii ) the spectra are then scaled with the luminosities ( again using the average value in a 100   passband centered at 5550  ) of theoretical spectra with the same stellar atmospheric parameters ( interpolated as necessary ) from the grid of @xcite  which were the input of the m05 models . in short ,",
    "the scaling of the empirical spectra is based on theoretical spectra , but our procedure allows us to keep , as much as possible , the continuum _ shape _ of the empirical spectra intact . for the miles case",
    "we have also verified that the choice of width and wavelength is not crucial , by recalculating the scaling using a much larger @xmath6  range , as adopted by other authors ( see section  5.3 ) .",
    "we note already now that the adopted procedure determines important features of the integrated stellar population model , a point on which we return when comparing our models with others from the literature ( section  5.3 ) .",
    "empirical libraries consistently lack cool dwarfs ( precise temperatures naturally vary with metallicity , but rough guidelines are @xmath34  k for stelib , @xmath35  k for elodie , and @xmath36  k for miles at non - solar metallicities ) , hence a supplement of theoretical spectra is necessary for completing the whole isochrone . for our purposes , the latest version of the marcs library @xcite was deemed the most suitable , comprising a comprehensive grid of cool stars ( 2500 - 8000 k ) at very high resolution ( r=20,000 ) over a large wavelength range ( 1300 - 200000   ) .",
    "first , the standard chemical composition of these spectra follow the general trend of milky way stars as the empirical libraries , i.e. display a moderate enhancement of @xmath37-elements ( [ @xmath37/fe]@xmath38 ) at [ fe / h ] between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with more metal - poor objects having [ @xmath37/fe]@xmath41 . quite relevant",
    ", we also verified that the optical colours of marcs stars and the corresponding integrated ssp models based solely on marcs spectra are in good agreement with those based on empirical stars only ( section  [ sec : ssp ] ) .",
    "this implies that our addition of these cool dwarfs does not alter the empirical spectral shape ( around the @xmath1-band ) .",
    "we have also verified that the strength of integrated lick indices is not affected by the use of cool marcs stars , in spite some lines do not agree with the correspondent features as obtained from the extrapolations of miles - based fitting functions ( johansson et al .",
    "2010 ) into the very low - temperature regime .",
    "this happens as very cool dwarfs and giants ( @xmath42 ) have little effect on integrated optical line - strengths , unless the imf is bottom - heavy ( maraston et al .",
    "it is well known that spectral lines in empirical and theoretical libraries do not always agree ( e.g. tripicco & bell 1995 ; korn , maraston & thomas 2005 ) , but a proper comparison at very low temperatures has not yet been done .",
    "since - as we mentioned - most empirical libraries lack very cool stars , one can not fully trust that the extrapolation of the lines observed in warmer stars is correct .",
    "it goes beyond the scope of this paper to examine each spectral feature of the marcs spectra in detail , and we defer this to a future publication .    before entering the synthesis ,",
    "the marcs spectra were smoothed to the lower resolution of the empirical libraries .",
    "we have also calculated ssp models fully based on the marcs library ( sec .",
    "[ sec : nirexte ] ) .      during the calculation of the miles - based models",
    "a comparison to the value of @xmath3  from the fitting functions of @xcite was performed , as we noted a discrepancy in the corresponding models .",
    "we found that indeed two stars , that otherwise do not display any peculiarity regarding the shape of their seds , had conspicuous @xmath3  strengths , one even had some balmer emission .",
    "these were removed from the synthesis and replaced with stars of similar sed shape and normal balmer strength values .",
    "the good agreement we find between solar - scaled models of lick indices based on index - by - index fitting functions @xcite and those calculated on the full sed presented in this paper comes from removing these anomalous stars ( see section  [ sec : lick ] ) .",
    "this example supports our viewpoint that - when dealing with absorption lines using observations - it appears to be safer to take a look at the individual lines for spotting anomalous outliers , and the ff method is an effective way of doing so .      for galaxy formation and evolution studies ,",
    "an extension into the ultraviolet becomes necessary as the redshift gets progressively higher .",
    "of the four sets of models , only the pickles - based has a uv - extension . in order to improve on this situation ,",
    "alternative versions of models have been constructed , where we have performed a concatenation with the ssp models of @xcite , which are based on the fully theoretical uvblue / kurucz library of high - resolution ( r=10000 ) stellar spectra @xcite , and have a wavelength coverage of 1000 - 4700   .",
    "after downgrading the uvblue - based models to the appropriate resolution of each respective set of models , and normalising them onto the m05 models using the average flux in a 100  wide passband centered at 3050  , the merging takes place around 3750  . for the elodie models",
    "the merging is performed between 3960 and 3990   .",
    "figure  [ fig : uvmerge ] zooms into the merging zone between uvblue - based and empirically - based miles models for various ages and metallicities .",
    "the overlapping region looks excellent at young ages , where also the population flux in the uv is higher . at intermediate - ages",
    "the matching is still very good , though one notices some excess flux in the theoretical library especially at super - solar metallicity . at old ages",
    "the excess flux is evident at all metallicities .",
    "it is hard to say what the source of this noise is , but the flux level here is very low and should be irrelevant in spectral analysis .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : uvmergem05 ] shows another example of merged models , using the 400 myr stelib - based model ( blue ) and the m05 .",
    "the merging takes place here at 3752.5  .",
    "high - resolution models that reach further into the near - infrared than what can be accomplished with empirical spectra are equally useful .",
    "we therefore calculated a grid of ssp models adopting the marcs library of high - resolution , theoretical stellar spectra @xcite , which covers an impressive spectral range from 1300   to 20 @xmath43 m with a resolution of r@xmath2720,000 .",
    "the library is somewhat limited in terms of stellar temperatures ",
    "the highest temperature is 8000 k at any metallicity  which translates into a minimum age of 0.8 gyr at 2 z@xmath44 , and around 6 gyr at the lowest metallicity . in the latter case",
    "a problem arises also for the oldest populations , where the shedding of mass towards the end of the rgb phase causes deeper , hotter layers in the stars to be exposed .",
    "if the mass - loss is severe enough , horizontal branch stars hotter than 8000  k will be produced . for a detailed account of the mass - loss prescription employed here ,",
    "the reader is referred to m05 .    furthermore , we calculated a version of the miles - based ssp models in which we extended them into the uv as explained in section 4.5 and into the near - ir using the marcs - based models illustrated in this section .",
    "these _ merged _ models are probably the models with the largest wavelength coverage at high resolution that are presently available .",
    "the simple stellar population ( ssp ) models that can be calculated for each of the four different empirical libraries , in terms of age and metallicity , are shown schematically in figures  [ fig : covpic]-[fig : covelo ] .",
    "it is evident that empirical spectra alone can not account for all desired combinations of these parameters .",
    "for example , no library contains the hot stars of low metallicity that are required to build metal - poor ssp models with young ages .",
    "naturally , this is because star formation in the milky way takes place in the metal - rich disc .         for the miles library.,width=317 ]     for the stelib library .",
    "models in the striped area have limited wavelength coverage.,width=317 ]     for the elodie library.,width=317 ]    as mentioned earlier , the pickles - based ssp models ( figure  [ fig : covpic ] ) are only available at solar metallicity .",
    "the presence of o - type stars in the library allows for very young ages to be modelled ( down to around 2 myr , where the turn - off stars have a temperature of roughly 40000  k ) , but these spectra are also significantly attenuated by dust absorption in the uv .",
    "hence the pickles - based models with the youngest ages ( below @xmath15100 myr ) should be used somewhat more cautiously .",
    "the miles - based ssp models display the most comprehensive sampling of the model grid of all the four empirical libraries ( see fig.[fig : covmil ] ) . reflecting the chemical evolution of the milky way",
    ", no particularly young ages can be modelled at the lowest metallicity . in general , the mapping of stellar atmospheric parameter at this metallicity is rather coarse , hence these models should be treated with some reservation . as previously mentioned , the [ fe / h]@xmath452.0 models , together with the [ fe / h]@xmath451.3 models , are expected to be enhanced in [ mg / fe ] by around @xmath240.4 dex .",
    "the amount of spectra in the stelib library with twice solar , solar , and half solar metallicities is adequate to produce models down to relatively young ages .",
    "a caveat is that some of the stars of non - solar metallicity in the stelib library do not have complete spectroscopic observations over the entire quoted wavelength range of @xmath46   .",
    "the correspondent models will cover a narrower wavelength range of @xmath47    ( see figure  [ fig : covste ] ) .",
    "the elodie library contains a number of very hot o - type stars , which in principle would allow us to produce models as young as 1 myr .",
    "the spectra of these recently born stars are , regrettably but not surprisingly , severely reddened by close - in dust , and/or displaying various amounts of emission lines , and many of them had to be discarded in the population synthesis , thereby setting the age limit at solar metallicity to @xmath153 myr . at half - solar metallicity",
    "it is instead a lack of hotter supergiants ( @xmath31 6000 k ) that sets a limit to the age of the youngest model",
    ".    it should be noted , though , that despite the removal of the worst spectra , the youngest models are not completely unaffected by the dust reddening of their turnoff stars . at the lowest metallicity , 1/100 z@xmath44 , the sampling of ( t@xmath10 , log(g))-space in the elodie library is fairly crude .",
    "a few ages can be modelled , but a complete evolutionary coverage is lacking , and they should thus be treated with some caution .",
    "there are not enough stars around to warrant the calculation of models of any age at that metallicity .",
    "figure  [ fig : age_literature ] shows the age effects at fixed solar metallicity , comparing our miles - based models to the models by @xcite ( that are based on miles ) .",
    "the 0.1 gyr model compares well .",
    "the higher flux longward 5000   in the models at 1 gyr is due to the tp - agb phase . at old ages , the slightly higher flux longward 6000",
    "  in the vazdekis models is due to the redder rgbs of the padova tracks that are used in these models ( see figure 7 in m05 and discussion ) .",
    "we also calculated broad - band colours , in order to spot differences due to the different libraries .",
    "figure  [ fig : colorsyoung ] displays the integrated colours of the youngest models as a function of the various spectral libraries .",
    "colours plotted are those that could be computed given the intrinsic wavelength extension of the library through the near - ir , e.g. miles allows the computation of the sole @xmath2 , whereas stelib allows also the computation of @xmath48 and @xmath49 . @xmath50 and @xmath51 are calculated through the extension with the m05-uvblue models .",
    "the pickles - based models based on their intrinsic uv from pickles ( which in turn is based on empirical spectra from the iue database , cf .",
    "section  3.1 ) and the version extended with the uvblue library run very similar , hence we show only the first ones .",
    "overall , one sees an excellent agreement in the colours of very young stellar populations as a function of the spectral library for most colours .",
    "some discrepancy is visible in the optical - to - near - ir colours of model ages where red supergiants exist ( @xmath52 ) , which are however well inside the typical scatter associated to colour indices at these young ages , which in turn is due to the short duration of the red supergiant phase ( see marigo et al .",

    "2008 for a general discussion on red supergiants ) .",

    "m05 is shown as a black line .",
    "in general , significant differences are found between models based on different empirical spectral libraries .",
    "shortward @xmath53    ( top panel ) the models run very similar and close to the m05 model , the latter displaying a small excess flux around 4600   . in the range @xmath54",
    "  the various models display a very clear behaviour , i.e. all empirical models display a flux deficit with respect to the m05 .",
    "we focus on this effect in the next subsection .",
    "the only exception to this trend are the elodie - based models , which have an overall higher flux , lying in between the other models and the m05 , and reconciling onto the m05 at @xmath55 .",
    "the reasons for such trend remain unclear , but it could possibly be related to the flux calibration , which at very high resolution is quite difficult .",
    "in addition , as noticed in @xcite and discussed in section  [ libraries ] , the miles spectra lack flux longward of @xmath56   which is reflected in the ssp models ( figure  [ fig:12gyrsed ] ) .",
    "we find that a substantial part of this effect is due to the assumed temperature scale for rgb - bump stars with temperatures between 4000 and 5500 @xmath57 . in section 3.6",
    "we discuss the difference in temperature scales and we made an experiment in which we tied the stelib library onto the miles temperature scale . here",
    "we show the resulting stellar population models in figure  [ fig : tescalemilonstelib ] .",
    "the blue line shows the original stelib - based ssp , the black line the one we obtain using the miles temperature scale , and the green line shows the miles - based ssp .",
    "it is striking how much the near - ir flux has dropped by applying the simple re - scaling .",
    "we could figure out that this effect is dominated by rgb - bump stars .",
    "this highlights the importance of understanding the effects of the assumptions on adopted temperature scales on stellar population models @xcite .",
    "for example , as discussed in @xcite , the different slopes of the models affect optical - to - near - ir colours and the interpretation of galaxy data .",
    "we notice that our models based on the pickles and stelib libraries , but also those based on the theoretical library marcs , in which no temperature scale calibration needed to be input , agree well long - ward 6000   ( cfr .",
    "figure 15 ) . given the effect a different temperature scale for rgb stars has on the spectral shape of the integrated models , in appendix [ sec : corrmil ] we further expand on this point and provide a version of our miles - based models in which we revise the near - ir slope to better match the one of the other libraries . though we can not be certain that the near - ir slope of miles is not correct only because it does not compare well with those from other libraries , another fact in support of a revised slope is the observed - frame @xmath58  colours of massive luminous and red galaxies in the 2slaq survey , which were found to be systematically redder than colours obtained with a variety of existing models ( wake et al .",
    "2006 ) . in maraston",
    "( 2009 ) we improved upon that issue using pickles - based models , and we noticed that miles - based models - with their intrinsic near - ir slope - did not perform as well ( figure 3,4 of maraston et al .",
    "though not being a clear - cut argument , it is an interesting hint towards a specific spectral shape .",
    "obviously , observations of simpler systems such as star clusters would be very beneficial to constrain the effect .",
    "finally , at @xmath59    ( middle and bottom panels ) pickles - based and stelib - based models , and m05 run quite similar one to each other , except at 7500  8300   and 9000  where the pickles - based models have consistently lower flux than the m05 models , whereas the stelib - based models lie closer to m05 .",
    "it is presently quite hard to calibrate these effects as one would need excellent quality near - ir spectra of old , solar metallicity gcs such as those in the baade window , that are on the other hand strongly affected by reddening .",
    "while these will be available in the near future , we shall use galaxies to try discriminating among these effects in a future paper .",
    "it should be stressed that in figure  [ fig:12gyrsed ] we have normalised all models at a certain wavelength ( 5050  ) , which allows us to emphasise the spectral shape around it .",
    "this is obviously just a _ visualisation _ , the quantitative effect is derived by calculating the flux ratios of the models , i.e. by means of broadband colours .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ fig : colorsold ] , which is analogous to figure  [ fig : colorsyoung ] for older ages .",
    "the colours of old models are contributed to by several stellar evolutionary phases ( see e.g. m05 ) and the comparison of figure  [ fig : colorsold ] tells us that - at the same energetics - differences in the individual stellar spectra matter .",
    "this point was amply discussed in @xcite where a first version of these models was published , and in m05 regarding mw gcs .",
    "in particular , we confirm the results of @xcite for the @xmath60 colour , here for the @xmath2 colour , which when using empirical libraries - all of them - is bluer than the one relative to the m05 models , which are based on the basel assembly of the kurucz model atmospheres .",
    "in particular , notice that both the @xcite models and the m05-marcs feature a bluer @xmath2 , in close agreement with the empirical models . this point will be amply discussed in the next subsection .      in @xcite we found that ssp models based on empirical libraries ( from pickles , miles , stelib ) displayed a lower flux around the @xmath1-band with respect to equivalent models based on the basel theoretical library , an effect which helped to a better matching of the sdss @xmath61  colours of luminous red galaxies around redshift 0.4 . there , we also showed ( figure  4 ) that the same effect was found in the individual stars from the libraries , especially in giants stars , which secured us against possible artificial effects introduced by the synthesis itself .",
    "the models used in that paper were a sub - sample of the extensive grid presented here , where we confirm our earlier finding .    in this paper",
    "we consider two further models that strengthen our conclusions .",
    "figure  [ fig : lrg ] is equivalent to figure 3 in @xcite , and a blow - up of the middle panel of figure  [ fig:12gyrsed ] with two important addition , namely the @xcite models based on miles ( magenta ) and our new models based on the theoretical stellar library marcs ( section  4.6 ) .",
    "the figure clearly shows that the completely independent @xcite models display exactly the same effect as ours .",
    "furthermore , the m05-marcs models behave as the empirically - based models .",
    "note that the latter models do not require any adjustment or scaling of the marcs spectra to be computed , which reinforces the conclusion that the procedure we adopt to insert the empirical libraries in the synthesis is appropriate .",
    "finally , as we already pointed out , the slope long - ward 6000   agrees very well between stelib - based , pickles - based , and marcs - based models , while miles - based models display lower flux , which is mostly due to the temperature calibration of rgb stars in this library .",

    "figure  [ fig : bvall ] shows the @xmath2  colour of their models , based on miles and on basel ( red dotted and solid ) .",

    "we note that these authors adopt a different procedure to insert the empirical spectra in the population synthesis , which is matching the empirical spectra to the theoretical ones ( from basel ) in the @xmath2 colour , i.e. without using the library stellar parameters",

    "star clusters in the milky way with abundance ratios known from individual stellar spectroscopy are not as ambiguous as distant galaxies and were used by maraston et al .",

    "they also match the lines of massive galaxies .",
    "the miles library is not much different from the early lick library from the point of view of abundance - ratios , in that it contains the same milky way - type of stars and in particular no bulge stars , that would provide the metal - rich and @xmath64$]-enhanced population that is missing in the solar vicinity .",
    "hence , the indices calculated on the model seds we present in this paper are expected not to match the lines of metal - rich and @xmath64$]-enhanced populations , that can be found in external massive galaxies and star clusters .",
    "for this reason , @xcite calculated element - abundance - ratio - sensitive models based on miles stars but following the same philosophy of thomas et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , i.e. by theoretically manipulating the index response functions .",
    "nonetheless it is interesting to see how the lick indices calculated on the integrated model seds of this paper compare with those from the tmj models .",
    "figure  [ fig : lickall ] shows all 25 lick indices in order of increasing wavelength from top to bottom , with the exception of the balmer lines that are listed besides one each other at the top .",
    "lick indices directly calculated on the model seds presented in this paper are shown as black lines , tmj models for two different abundance - ratio patterns , namely solar - scaled ( red ) and @xmath64=0.3 $ ]  ( blue ) , are also shown , with solid and dashed line - style referring to solar and sub - solar ( @xmath65 )  total metallicity [ z / h ] .",
    "also shown as green lines are models obtained by integrating the miles - based ff of johansson et al .",
    "this type of models help us understanding whether discrepancies between the sed - based and the tmj models are due to the sed vs ff approach",
    ".    in general , indices from the integrated seds ( black lines ) should be in agreement with solar - scaled tmj models at solar metallicity ( solid red lines ) and with @xmath64=0.3$]-tmj models at low metallicity ( dotted blue lines ) , because of the intrinsic chemical bias milky way stars carry into the calculations ( see discussion above ) .",
    "this is indeed the case for the vast majority of indices .",
    "only a few cases do not follow this trend , on which we comment below .",
    "as mentioned , the comparison between green lines and black lines helps us spotting discrepancies due to the different approach , namely integration on seds or ff .",
    "overall , there is an amazing agreement between our calculations following the two approaches for most indices at both metallicities . neglecting minor differences , such as e.g. the ca4227",
    ", one index sticks out for having a discrepant value between direct integration ( black ) and ff approach ( green ) , namely fe4531 at sub - solar metallicity .",
    "we verified that this is due to a slight offset of the correspondent ff for giant stars.the fe4531 indices of these stars are particularly sensitive to gravity effects ( johansson et al . 2010 ) .",
    "thus the modeling of this index is complicated , from both the sed and ff point of view , especially at metallicities below @xmath40 where the number of miles stars is fairly low . however , the chemical enrichment modelling by tmj is able to rectify the offset introduced by the ff , such that the end - point tmj @xmath37-enhanced model ( blue line ) perfectly agrees with the values integrated onto the seds ( black lines ) , and the tmj index model is perfectly calibrated against gcs ( see tmj , figure  3 ) .    at sub - solar metallicity",
    "some indices do not follow the expected trend of matching the tmj @xmath64$]-enhanced ( dotted blue lines ) .",
    "these are : @xmath66 , which is weaker in the sed - based approach with respect to the tmj model , and the g - band g4300 - and to a lesser extent fe4383 and fe5406 - which are stronger . in all these cases",
    "one sees that the use of ff in tmj vs the sed - integration approach ( i.e. green vs black ) is not responsible for the effect ( with the possible exception of @xmath66  at low ages , where the warmest ms dwarfs have a higher index value than the one approximated by the ffs ) .",
    "the major part of the effect comes from the correction of the element ratio bias in the tmj approach . as discussed in tmb",
    ", these models assume that the stellar metallicities [ fe / h ] in the input library reflect true iron abundance rather than total metallicity . as a consequence ,",
    "the metallicity scale gets slightly shifted through the bias correction , which leads to weaker metal and stronger balmer indices at low metallicities .",
    "this effect is indeed seen here with g4300 and @xmath66 being most affected such that the index g4300 is weaker and @xmath66 stronger in the tmj model .",
    "it should be noted that these particular indices follow a very good calibration with gc values as shown in tmj .    at solar metallicity",
    ", there is none of such noticeable cases , and the sed - based calculations ( solid black ) and the tmj models with solar - scaled abundance ratios ( solid red lines ) agree well .",
    "some slight differences can be seen for ca4227 , @xmath67 and cn1 , which ought to be ascribed to the ff being slightly lower than the sed calculation .",
    "we note that the indices by vazdekis et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ( magenta lines in figure  [ fig : lickall ] ) - which are obtained through direct integration on their miles - based model seds - display similar discrepancies for the above mentioned indices , but these are typically larger and show a different age dependence , see the g4300 band , @xmath67 or the fe5015 , among the others .",
    "note also that some indices are well offset , such as the ca4227 and the tio indices .",
    "the exact reason for these difference is hard to assess , but it should be kept in mind that the vazdekis et al . ( 2010 ) models are based on different evolutionary tracks ( from padova ) which have redder rgbs than the tracks used in our models and a different overshooting ( see m05 ) .    aside from the above discussion , note that the tio indices are stronger at ages around 1 gyr due to the tp - agb contribution in the maraston models and the use of the empirical tp - agb spectra ( see section  3.7 ) .",
    "also the mg@xmath68 index , which is known to be sensitive to carbon ( thomas , johansson , maraston 2011 ; see also tripicco & bell 1995 ) , is stronger at the same ages in the sed - based models .",
    "in this section we provide a few examples on how the new models perform in fitting real objects . following our previous works",
    ", we use globular clusters as they are the closest approximation to simple stellar populations , i.e. age and metallicity for each cluster can be determined from resolved studies independently of stellar population models .",
    "suitable for this test are milky way and magellanic clouds objects .",
    "as we are mostly interested to test the effect of spectral libraries , which - as they do not contain any tp - agb star - is mostly concentrated on old populations , we shall not repeat all comparison plots published in m05 using magellanic clouds clusters . in the following we shall use only mw gcs data . as is well known ,",
    "mw field and globular cluster stars feature a well defined pattern of chemical abundance ratios , in particular the @xmath64 $ ]  ratio - at given total metallicity .",
    "this introduces a _ bias _ in models based on empirical mw stars ( maraston et al .",
    "2003 ; thomas , maraston & bender  2003 ) that we shall take qualitatively into account in our comparisons .",
    "note that empirical libraries contain - besides field stars - also globular cluster stars , in particular bright red giant branch stars , but these show a similar element abundance pattern as field stars @xcite hence their inclusion does not affect our conclusions .    in the following we show tests involving both gc spectra as well as gcs broad - band colours .",
    "we use the samples of @xcite and @xcite , with main focus on the latter , which consists of 40 objects that represent the full range of mw gc parameters at an instrumental resolution of 3.1  fwhm , and s / n ratios between 100 and 400 .",
    "@xcite s spectra have a coarser resolution ( 6.7  fwhm ) because the aim was to evaluate lick indices , and have concentrated on the most metal - rich bulge clusters , but 11 out of their total number of 12 objects are in common with the @xcite compilation , thus enabling a comparison also between different samples ( see section  6.1.3 ) .",
    "both sets of spectra have been flux calibrated , but neither have been corrected for reddening .",
    "gc ages and metallicities from our new sed models have been derived through a standard sed - fitting procedure , where we compute the @xmath69 between observed and model seds over the wavelength range 3600 - 6200  , pixel by pixel ( 2600 pixels ) , using the s / n spectra for assigning errors to each pixel . the observed spectra are de - reddened prior to the fitting , using a simplified version of the wavelength - dependent mw interstellar extinction law of @xcite with r=3.1 and the @xmath70  parameter compiled in @xcite this parameter depends strongly on the line - of - sight ; however , since the purpose of this exercise is to show that , despite a rather simple approach , very reasonable estimates of gc parameters can be obtained in all but a few cases , such approximations may be forgiven .",
    "for testing we use both the miles - based and stelib - based models , which have a resolution comparable to the gc spectra .",

    "model grids have been interpolated in age and metallicity in order to avoid clustering of solutions around the grid points . the horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology has been taken into account , in the sense that model seds have been pre - selected according to it .",

    "the difference between this work and other similar in the literature is that - by exploring a wide range of empirical stellar libraries - we could also assess their effect on a stellar population model , which could be regarded as the second goal of this work .    in general , the spectra of stars in common to the various libraries present discrepancies in selected spectral regions , which are shown and discussed , most of which get smoothed out in the integrated stellar population models , which display - at the end - a fair level of homogeneity .",
    "however , some differences remain , which will be interesting to test with data of galaxies and star clusters .",
    "for example , miles - based population models display lower flux at their near - ir edge - long - ward of @xmath87 - with respect to population models based on both the empirical stelib or pickles libraries as well as to those based on the theoretical library marcs .",
    "we could trace this effect as mainly due to the temperature scale adopted for rgb stars in miles .    as a relevant result",
    ", we confirm our earlier finding that the visual region of the spectrum of models based on empirical spectral libraries has lower flux ( in a normalised sense ) with respect to the basel - kurucz or the original kurucz library @xcite .",
    "the only exception are the models based on the elodie library , that however have such a high resolution that flux calibration becomes more difficult .",
    "this effect helped to a better match of the @xmath88  colours of luminous red galaxies at redshift 0.4 and here we show that it also improves the comparison with the @xmath2 vs [ z / h ] relation for milky way gcs .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the finding of peacock et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that the models of this paper better trace the @xmath5  colours of globular clusters in m31 .",
    "most importantly , in this work we find that the theoretical library marcs agrees well with the empirical libraries .",
    "this guarantees that the effect does not originate from the complicated procedure required to insert an empirical library in a population synthesis code .",
    "the adopted procedure matters , however .",
    "we have used the stellar parameters provided by the libraries and scaled the empirical spectra using the theoretical flux in a well - defined region .",
    "alternative approaches match the empirical spectra to theoretical ones to insert the empirical libraries in the code ( as done by bruzual & charlot  2003 , for example ) . in this way",
    ", differences between empirical and theoretical spectra are diluted .",
    "we also show that other recent models based on miles - namely those by vazdekis et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and by conroy & gunn ( 2010 ) - confirm the @xcite results , i.e. the impact of using empirical atmospheres on population models , even if details maybe different .",
    "curiously , conroy & gunn ( 2010 ) came to the opposite conclusion .",
    "we also discuss extensively the lick indices calculated directly on the integrated miles - based seds and compare them with those calculated using the fitting function ( ff ) approach as well as with element ratio sensitive index models ( thomas , maraston & johansson 2011 ) . in general , we find an excellent agreement between ff - based and sed - based index models .",
    "we also find a good agreement with the models by tmj , if the metallicity dependent chemical pattern of the milky way stars is properly taken into account in this comparison .",
    "sed - based models agree with solar - scaled tmj models at high - metallicity and with @xmath64-$]enhanced models at sub - solar metallicity , because stellar libraries carry into the models the spectral pattern imprinted of the element abundance ratios of the milky way field stars they are built upon .",
    "we tested the age and metallicity scales of the models by fitting the observed seds of milky way gcs with ages and metallicities independently known from isochrone cmd fitting and resolved spectroscopy .",
    "we find overall good agreement when we perform full spectral fitting , suggesting that this an effective method to derive ages of stellar systems .",
    "this is because the spectral shape is age - sensitive even if details of spectral lines are not well - matched due to abundance ratio effects .",
    "moreover , as we already noted - these models are - qualitatively - [ @xmath37/fe]-enhanced at sub - solar metallicities and solar - scaled at @xmath89 and above , which also partly explains the good match to milky way gcs . for example",
    ", we could obtain excellent fits of the observed sed of the old open cluster m67 of the milky way disk , which has approximately a solar metallicity and 3 gyr of age , and solar scaled abundance ratios .    however , we find that - when we use - instead of the full spectral fitting - selected absorption lines without including a treatment of abundance - ratio effects - ages are underestimated and metallicities are overestimated .",
    "this is because absorption lines are very sensitive to element abundance ratio effects and peculiarities , which can be different between the stars composing the empirical libraries and external stellar systems such as star clusters and galaxies .",
    "a better agreement is achieved when one uses a sub - sample of indices the combination of which is little sensitive to element abundance ratios ( namely h@xmath74 , mgb , fe4383 , fe5335 , fe5406 , see thomas , johansson & maraston 2011 for details ) .",
    "these facts should be considered when comparing these models to data .",
    "using absorption line models including abundance ratio effects instead provide ages and metallicities in good agreement with the cmd - based ones ( thomas , johansson , maraston 2011 ) and the full spectral fitting performed with the sed models presented here .",
    "finally , for m67 we noticed an interesting effect arising from the use of different libraries , namely that the models based on stelib releases as best - fit ( minimum @xmath69 ) a solution which is identical to the one from cmd fitting , whereas the miles - based models give an older age and a lower metallicity , even if the solution with parameters as from the cmd fitting has a @xmath69 which is comparably good .",
    "this difference may originate from the miles - based models being slightly bluer than the stelib - based ones , hence releasing older ages . obviously , a result based on just one object is merely a speculation , but it will be interesting to check whether such an effect persists using galaxy data , which we shall pursue in a future paper .",

    "_ the temperature calibration_. for each @xcite standard spectrum ( we remind the reader that these are averages of several different stars of the same spectral type and luminosity class , and as such , should be less vulnerable to stochastic variations ) we obtained the best - fitting miles spectrum in terms of minimising the sum of squared residuals . in general",
    ", it appears that the miles temperatures are slightly underestimated with respect to the pickles temperatures . in particular , this holds true for red giant branch bump and tip stars , whose impact on the integrated near - ir light of old stellar populations is significant .",
    "a spectral library with , on average , cooler temperatures , will have the effect that the integrated sed becomes bluer .",
    "this connects nicely to the discussion about the temperature scale in sections  [ sec : fluxcal ] and 3.6 .",
    "thus , by replacing the miles temperatures with the pickles ones for these stars , we are able to achieve higher flux levels red - ward of 6200  .",
    "gaps in stellar parameter space . _ by shifting the coolest giants to slightly higher temperatures , there are no longer any cool enough stars to cover the parameter space required by the adopted stellar evolution prescription for the tip of the rgb and e - agb . by adding sufficiently cool stars , for example from the pickles library , part of the flux drop can be cured .",
    "3 .   _ short wavelength range systematic offset .",
    "_ besides the general lower flux long - ward 6300  we spotted another near - ir feature on miles spectra , namely a small dip in the flux levels between 6500 and 7000  .",
    "this feature emerged when we compared miles spectra - smoothed to the appropriate resolution - with pickles spectra .",
    "we found them to agree perfectly over the entire wavelength range , except in that short interval .",
    "this discrepancy can certainly not be ascribed to any difference in temperature , gravity , etc . , but must be an intrinsic difference between pickles and miles spectra .",
    "since the pickles spectra are averages of several observations from numerous different sources , while the miles spectra have all been obtained using the same instrumental setup , the most likely explanation is that this is an artefact originating from the miles instrumental setup .",
    "alternatively , this could be due to the adopted procedure for correcting against telluric absorption .",
    "note that we spotted this mini - dip only on some miles spectra as - in order to notice it - one needs to have an otherwise identical spectrum at moderate resolution , such as a pickles spectrum .",
    "the dip is probably present in all miles spectra - we argue it is a systematic - but we could not check all spectra in this respect for the above named reasons",
    "[ fig : mildip ] shows such best - fitting miles spectra to four standard @xcite spectra , accompanied by their respective flux ratios as a function of wavelength .",
    "miles spectra have been smoothed and rebinned to the pickles approximate resolution of r@xmath90500 , and 5 sampling .",
    "it is obvious that , even when the two spectral energy distributions agree on general very well , there is a systematic deviation rewards @xmath15  6500  . to counterbalance this",
    ", we have chosen 12 of the best - fitting miles spectra ( 6 dwarfs and 6 giants ) , fitted second - order polynomials to the flux ratios in the aforementioned spectral range for each of the 12 components , and applied the straight average of these fitting curves ( see fig.[fig : ratiocurves ] ) to all the miles stars .",
    "based on the above corrections , for the solar metallicity case we provide two versions of our miles - based models , original and revised .",
    "figure a3 shows how the correspondent spectra compare , for the illustrative age of 12 gyr ( all other ages behave the same way ) .",
    "one notice from the residual plot that - since the most affected stars are cool giants - the near - ir portion of the spectrum is the only one that is affected appreciably by our revision .",
    "we recall that the same exercise at different metallicities can not be made as it is based on pickles spectra and they exist mostly at solar metallicity .",
    "it will be interesting to understand the physical meaning of such revision - if any - , which can be accomplished by comparing these models with stellar , star cluster and galaxy data ."

    "<S> we present new , high - to - intermediate spectral resolution stellar population models , based on four popular libraries of empirical stellar spectra , namely pickles , elodie , stelib and miles . </S>",

    "<S> we further compute very high resolution ( r=20,000 ) models based on the theoretical stellar library marcs which extends to the near - infrared . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore provide _ merged _ high resolution stellar population models , extending from @xmath0    to 25,000   , using our previously published high resolution theoretical models which extended to the ultraviolet . </S>",
    "<S> we compare how these libraries perform in stellar population models and highlight spectral regions where discrepancies are found . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm our previous findings that the flux around the @xmath1 band is lower ( in a normalised sense ) in models based on empirical libraries than in those based on the basel - kurucz library , which results in a bluer @xmath2 colour . </S>",
    "<S> most noticeably the theoretical library marcs gives results fully consistent with the empirical libraries . </S>",
    "<S> this same effect is also found in other models using miles , namely vazdekis et al . and conroy & gunn , even though the latter authors reach the opposite conclusion . </S>",

    "<S> ( by 0.05 magnitudes in our models ) is in better agreement with both the colours of luminous red galaxies and globular cluster data . </S>",
    "<S> we test the models on their ability to reproduce , through full spectral fitting , the ages and metallicities of galactic globular clusters as derived from cmd fitting and find overall good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss extensively the lick indices calculated directly on the integrated miles - based seds and compare them with element ratio sensitive index models . </S>",
    "<S> we find a good agreement between the two models , if the metallicity dependent chemical pattern of the milky way stars is taken into account in this comparison . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the ages and metallicities of galactic globular clusters are not well reproduced when one uses straight the miles - based indices , because subtle chemical effects on individual lines dominate the age derivation . </S>",
