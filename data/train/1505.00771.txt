    "the existence of gravitationally attractive `` dark matter '' that dominates the matter composition of the universe has been firmly established based on overwhelming evidence from astronomical and cosmological observations  @xcite .",

    "there are strong theoretical motivations for the existence of beyond the standard model physics , many of which naturally predict new stable neutral particles at the electroweak symmetry breaking scale with weak interactions , generically named weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps )  @xcite . wimps are a leading dark matter ( dm )",
    "candidate where weak interactions between wimps and ordinary matter allow for a direct search for these particles through particle physics experiments . in recent decades , direct searches of wimp interactions with terrestrial detectors have been carried out in deep underground laboratories worldwide with ever increasing discovery power  @xcite .    since 2008 , a number of underground direct detection experiments have reported signals that could be interpreted as wimp interactions within the detector . among those",
    "are the dama / libra experiment using nai(tl ) crystals  @xcite , the cogent experiment  @xcite using point - contact ge detectors , the cresst - ii experiment  @xcite using cryogenic cawo@xmath1 bolometers ( excess not reproduced in the recent experiment  @xcite ) , as well as the cdms - si experiment using cryogenic si bolometers  @xcite .",
    "although the claimed signals are not generically consistent , they all point to low to median wimp mass in the range of 10 to 50gev / c@xmath0 . on the other hand , the zeplin - iii  @xcite , xenon-100  @xcite , lux  @xcite , and pandax - i  @xcite experiments utilizing xenon , the darkside-50 experiment using argon  @xcite , the supercdms  @xcite and cdex  @xcite experiments using ge as targets , as as well as the kims experiment  @xcite using csi(tl ) crystals , are in disagreement with some or all of these claims .    to achieve sensitivities to wimps beyond the current experimental bounds ,",
    "detectors with larger targets , lower background , and lower energy threshold are required . in the past decade , dual phase xenon detectors have rapidly emerged as one of the most promising technologies in wimp direct detection , leading the wimp search sensitivity in a wide range of parameter space  @xcite , demonstrating superior scalability in mass , and the capability to shield against and reject background . however , in comparison to the cryogenic bolometers  @xcite or semi - conductor ionization detectors  @xcite , dual phase liquid xenon detectors have not demonstrated the ability to obtain a comparably low energy threshold .",
    "conventionally , the issue is attributed to insufficient light collection efficiency or a lack of understanding of the low energy nuclear recoil ( nr ) quenching factor . in recent years",
    ", the lux and pandax collaborations operated newly designed liquid xenon detectors which were constructed to optimize light collection efficiency . at the same time , a comprehensive model of scintillation and ionization processes in xenon known as the nest  @xcite , developed with simple phenomenological models and based on consideration of world data , is gradually being adopted in the xenon field .",

    "are produced in the liquid .",
    "ionized electrons are then drifted vertically upward by an induced drift field and extracted into the gas by an extraction field , producing the electroluminescence ( s2 signal ) . a top photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) array consists of 143 hamamatsu r8520 - 406 ( 1-in square ) tubes and a bottom array holds 37 hamamatsu r11410-mod ( 3-in circular ) tubes . the pmts view the active volume , collecting photons from both the s1 and s2 signals , with the bottom array dominating the light collection for both s1 and s2 signals .",

    "dark rates from pmts are tracked and used to characterize the stability of the detector .",

    "@xcite only weekly calibrated baselines were loaded .",
    "this update caused a downward shift of the light yield of approximately 6% at 40kev@xmath10 electron - equivalent energy .",
    "several malfunctioning pmts are inhibited in the analysis . during operation , four bottom pmt channels gradually developed connection problems , manifest as improper base resistance or capacitance , and were inhibited in the analysis to avoid a time dependent light yield . among the rest of the bottom pmts , a number of them experienced excessive dark rate ( 10khz and above ) during the run but could sometimes be recovered through power cycling or lowering the corresponding high voltage .",
    "one channel was fully inhibited due to unstable dark rate .",
    "the channel inhibition led to another 10% reduction in light yield . on average , two to three bottom pmts had to run at a lower gain ( @xmath11 ) to maintain a manageable dark rate .",
    "for the top array , seven pmts gradually developed problems during the run and were inhibited as the problem showed up , but has lesser impact to the analysis presented here .",
    "gain correction was applied to baseline - subtracted waveforms based on the the results of weekly led calibration runs .",
    "a hit finder algorithm identifies signal hits channel - by - channel while tagging noise primarily due to the periodic 200khz electromagnetic interference from the caen pmt high voltage supplies , occasionally fluctuated above the 20 bit zero suppression threshold .",
    "the waveform is then integrated in the `` hit window '' to define the hit charge .",
    "the hits in different channels are then clustered in time using an improved charge dependent algorithm with high efficiency for in - time short s1 signals while avoiding splitting a low charge but wide s2 into multiple clusters .",
    "for each cluster , a software sum is formed on all digitized channels , from which one computes the full - width - half - maximum , the full - width-1/10-maximum , as well as the number of `` peaks '' in the cluster .",
    "a binary decision tree method is developed to sort any given cluster into s1-like and s2-like signals based on these variables .",
    "the identification efficiency is verified to be nearly 100% by checking waveforms of thousands identified clusters by eye .",
    "we developed further signal - level cuts to identify spurious noise in the s1-like and s2-like signals . for s1-like signals , we employed a further ripple - pattern cut on the software summed waveform , a cut on the ratio of charge computed from the summed waveform to the total hit charge  , and a cut on the ratio of the total number of noise hits to the total hits in the cluster .",
    "in addition , cuts are placed on the ratio of the height to area and that of the height to width . to avoid signals from afterpulsing ,",
    "s1 signals are required to be before the first good s2 signal . for s2",
    ", we developed a shape symmetry cut to remove events very close to the anode when s1 and s2 can not be easily separated in time , identifying those events with a characteristic sharp spike at the beginning of the s2 pulse .",
    "in addition , s2-like signals will be discarded if its ratio to the largest s2 is less than 1% or if such signal is consistent with a single - electron s2 with charge less than 30 pe ; the inefficiency due to these two cuts is estimated to be negligible by a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "periods with unstable overall pmt signal rates were identified during the run , possibly due to small discharges on the electrodes , producing light pulses .",
    "in addition to the earlier file - by - file cuts , a number of tighter data quality cuts were placed event - by - event to search for `` dirty waveforms '' , including a cut on the total number of s1-like signals , the ratio of s1 to total charge before the first s2 , and the ratio of the sum of s1 and s2 to the total charge ( which also suppresses multiple scattering events ) . to avoid ambiguity due to multiple s1-like signals per event , we require that the number of s1 should be either 1 or 2 , and in case of the latter the maximum s1 is identified as the primary if the charge of the second s1 does not exceed 50% of the first . finally , to suppress accidental background , we placed a 3-hit coincidence cut on any good signal , and a 300 pe cut on s2 ( discussed later ) .    finally , s1 and s2 signals are reconstructed into physical events .",
    "the vertical position is determined by the separation between s1 and s2 signals , assuming a drift speed of 1.7mm/@xmath6s under the drift field of 0.67kv / cm  @xcite .",
