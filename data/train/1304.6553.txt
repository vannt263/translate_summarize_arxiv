    "for the last two decades , much attention has been focused on the issue of critical and phase behaviour of fluids with coulomb interactions .",
    "these studies were motivated by controversial experimental results that demonstrated the three types of the critical behaviour in ionic fluids : ising - like critical behaviour , classical mean - field behaviour , and a crossover between these two regimes ( see refs  @xcite ) . in order to interpret the results , the ionic systems were classified as either solvophobic or coulombic .",
    "the main attention has been paid to the criticality of coulombic systems in which the phase separation is primarily driven by long - range electrostatic interactions .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the critical behaviour of coulombic systems belongs to the universality class of a three - dimensional ising model .",
    "earlier experiments that supported the expectation of mean - field critical behaviour could not be reproduced in later works ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "precise experiments indicate a crossover from ising to mean - field behaviour characterized by an increase of the non - classical region with the polarity increase of the solvent @xcite .",
    "many theoretical and numerical works on coulombic systems are based on a restricted primitive model ( rpm ) , i.e. , an equimolar mixture of equisized charged hard spheres immersed in a structureless dielectric continuum .",
    "it is established that the rpm undergoes a gas - liquid - like phase transition at low temperature and low density @xcite .",
    "reliable estimates of the location of the critical point have been obtained using simulations @xcite .",
    "simulations also strongly support the ising critical behaviour of the model @xcite .",
    "the major part of theoretical studies of the criticality in the rpm is based on the mean - field theories and deals with calculations of the reduced ginzburg temperature @xmath1 @xcite . according to the ginzburg criterion @xcite ,",
    "the mean - field theory is valid only when @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the mean - field reduced temperature and the mean - field critical temperature , respectively . generally , the previous estimates of the reduced ginzburg temperature of the rpm suggest the non - classical region in the coulombic systems to be of the same order , or even larger than in simple fluids @xcite . thus ,",
    "excluding the possibility of mean - field behavior of the rpm , these results fail to explain the experimentally observed reduction of the crossover temperature in coulombic systems .",
    "however , a very small value of @xmath1 for the rpm ( about @xmath6 times smaller than for a simple fluid model ) was found in ref .",
    "it should be stressed that two conditions are to be taken into account to get a reasonable result for the ginzburg temperature .",
    "the fist condition consists in the choice of  a reference model  exhibiting typical ising critical behaviour .",
    "the second one is the necessity to consider both the reference model and the model studied at the same level of approximation . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the values of the ginzburg temperature were calibrated by a typical model of simple fluids .",
    "however , they were mainly calculated at different , although often comparable , levels of approximation .",
    "on the other hand , the criticality of coulombic systems has been studied using the functional integration methods @xcite . in particular , several attempts",
    "have been made in order to derive the effective ginzburg - landau - wilson ( glw ) hamiltonian of the rpm @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective hamiltonian is obtained in terms of a scalar field conjugate to the charge density .",
    "however , a non - perturbative renormalization group analysis of such hamiltonian does not allow one to make an unambiguous statement on the nature of the critical behaviour of the rpm .",
    "an attempt to derive the effective hamiltonian of the rpm in terms of the number density field , strong fluctuating quantity in the vicinity of the gas - liquid critical point , was made using the collective variables ( cvs ) method in ref .",
    "the analysis of the hamiltonian coefficients shows that in spite of the long - range character of the coulomb potential , the effective interactions are of a short - range character and describe attraction .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian suggests the ising - like criticality of the rpm .",
    "however , the numerical estimations of the relevant coefficients were not presented in this work .",
    "more recently , an effect of the long - range interactions on the ginzburg temperature has been studied on the basis of the lgw hamiltonian expressed in terms of the field conjugate to the order parameter @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian coefficients are presented therein in the form of an expansion in powers of the ionicity measuring the strength of the coulomb interaction , and the consideration is restricted to the second power .",
    "the results have shown that an increase in the coulomb interactions leads to a decrease of the temperature region of the crossover regime which confirms the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "a reduction of the reduced crossover temperature with an increase of the ionicity is also indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , though it is weak compared to the experimental data .",
    "the limiting system with the pure coulomb interactions , which is the rpm , lies outside the range of validity of the perturbative treatments developed in refs  @xcite .",
    "recently , non - classical critical exponents have been found for the rpm using the hierarchical reference theory @xcite .",
    "however , an issue of the width of the critical region has not been addressed in this work .    summarizing",
    ", we can state that the nature of the non - classical region in the coulomb dominated systems remains of fundamental interest and presents a real challenge .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to derive a microscopic - based effective hamiltonian of the ionic model supplemented by short - range attractive interactions and on its basis to consistently calculate the ginzburg temperature for both the pure coulombic model and the pure solvophobic model as well as for the model parameters ranging between the two limiting cases . to this end",
    ", we use the cvs - based theory developed for the description of phase transitions in ionic systems ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . following the ideas of ref .",
    "@xcite , we integrate out the variables connected with the charge - density fluctuations and derive the effective hamiltonian in terms of the variables describing the total number density fluctuations . in this paper , we find the explicit expressions for all the coefficients of the effective @xmath0-model hamiltonian at the same level of approximation , namely , in the one - loop approximation corresponding to a one sum over the wave vector .",
    "this enables us to get consistent estimates for the critical parameters as well as for the hamiltonian coefficients for a whole range of the model parameters .",
    "the ginzburg temperature for the pure coulombic model obtained in this way appears to be about twenty times smaller than for a simple fluid .",
    "we also study the effect of the interplay of short - range and long - range interactions on the ginzburg temperature .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give some brief background to the cvs - based theory for a charge - asymmetric primitive model with additional short - range attractive interactions included .",
    "iii is devoted to the derivation of the effective hamiltonian of the model in the vicinity of the gas - liquid critical point . in sec .",
    "iv we calculate the ginzburg temperature for the hard - sphere square - well model , the rpm as well as for the models including both short - range and long - range interactions .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
