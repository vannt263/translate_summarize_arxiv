    "the development of ultrafast electron and x - ray sources allows the investigation of processes that occur at the ultrafast and ultra - small scales ( sub - picosecond and nanometre ) @xcite .",

    "@xcite , these processes can currently be investigated with in the order of 10 nanosecond temporal resolution and 10 nanometre spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "the ultracold electron source would be very well suited to investigate ( ultra)fast processes with electron diffraction , as it allows the production of high - intensity , high - coherence electron bunches , by means of near - threshold photoionization of laser - cooled atoms @xcite . in order to produce high - quality diffraction patterns ,",
    "the transverse coherence length @xmath0 of the electron bunch should be larger than the lattice constant of the crystal under investigation . in turn",
    ", @xmath0 can be expressed in terms of the effective source temperature @xmath1 , which is then a measure for the quality of the source ; this gives @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the root - mean - square ( rms ) size of the electron beam at the sample , @xmath4 the size of the beam at the source , @xmath5 the electron rest mass , and @xmath6 boltzmann s constant @xcite .",
    "previously , the source temperature of the ultracold source has been measured with nanosecond photoionization to be as low as @xmath7k @xcite , while for femtosecond ionization @xmath8k can be achieved @xcite .",
    "in contrast , photocathode sources and dtems have a source temperature in excess of 1250k @xcite .",
    "this shows the advantage of the ultracold source , both for nanosecond and sub - picosecond electron pulses , as the lower source temperature leads to larger coherence lengths .",
    "this allows the investigation of samples with larger lattice constants or improves the diffraction data quality .",
    "alternatively , for a fixed source temperature one could reduce the size of the electron beam at the sample position , when a smaller coherence length is sufficient . as preferably every electron in the pulse is used for diffraction , a smaller beam size allows smaller samples ; for example for biological systems , samples are hard to make with a large size .    in this work ,",
    "the influence of the ionization laser polarization on the source temperature is studied . for both nanosecond and femtosecond photoionization",
    ", the temperature has been measured as a function of the polarization angle for a range of wavelengths of the ionization laser .",
    "we find that the temperature oscillates sinusoidally with the polarization angle .",
    "a classical model is used to describe the general trends and magnitudes of the data .",
    "this work not only helps us to optimize the performance of the ultracold electron source , but also provides more insight in the physics that plays a role in near - threshold photoionization ; both of which are essential for further development of this source .",
    "furthermore , the influence of the polarization on the bunch charge is discussed .",
    "in this section , a brief overview of the experimental setup and the measurement method is given .",

    "electron beams are created from an ultracold source by near - threshold photoionization of laser - cooled atoms .",
    "first @xmath9rb atoms are laser - cooled and trapped in a vapour - cell magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , leading to an atom cloud with an rms radius of 1 mm , containing about @xmath10 particles .",
    "then , a part of the trapped atoms are excited to the 5@xmath11 state with a 780 nm diode laser ( fig.[fig : setup_pol]a ) , propagating at a small angle with the @xmath12-axis ( fig.[fig : setup_pol]c ) , and subsequently ionized close to the ionization threshold by a laser pulse with wavelength @xmath13 ( @xmath14 nm ) .",
    "the ionization laser is linearly polarized in the @xmath15@xmath12-plane , and its polarization angle @xmath16 can be set by a half - wave plate ; for @xmath17 the polarization vector points in the @xmath12-direction ( fig.[fig : setup_pol]b ) .",
    "the energy the electrons gain in the photoionization process is characterized by the excess energy @xmath18 ( see fig.[fig : setup_pol]a ) ; it is the sum of the ionization energy with respect to the ionization threshold @xmath19 in zero electric field and the stark shift @xmath20 of the ionization threshold by the acceleration field , @xmath21 with @xmath22 the ionization threshold wavelength ( 479.06 nm for @xmath9rb in the 5@xmath11 state ) , @xmath23ev the hartree energy , and @xmath24v / m the atomic unit of field strength .",
    "finally , the electrons are extracted and accelerated by an electric field @xmath25 . after leaving the accelerator ,",
    "the electrons pass a magnetic lens and arrive at @xmath26 m at the detector , consisting of a micro - channel plate ( mcp ) detector with a phosphor screen , imaged onto a ccd camera ( fig.[fig : setup_pol]c ) .",
    "an upper limit of the effective source temperature can be found by measuring the beam size at the detector as a function of the current through a magnetic lens , a so - called waist scan @xcite .",
    "this measurement is comparable to measuring the rayleigh length of a laser beam , with a larger rayleigh length corresponding to a higher coherence ( lower temperature ) ; here the beam size is not measured at different positions around the waist , but the beam size is measured at a fixed position while varying the lens strength .    in this work",
    ", we present data for nanosecond and femtosecond photoionization . in the former case",
    ", atoms are ionized by a pulsed dye laser with a full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) pulse length of 5ns .",
    "the electron beam was extracted from an initial volume with transverse rms dimensions of @xmath27 m , determined by the overlap of the excitation and ionization laser .",

    "the femtosecond laser pulses had a rms bandwidth of 4 nm , as observed on a spectrometer , leading to electron bunches with a substantial spread in excess energy .",
    "this is in contrast to nanosecond ionization , where the spread in excess energy due to the bandwidth of the nanosecond laser ( @xmath351pm or @xmath352ghz ) can be neglected .",

    "we have also shown two detector images of the electron beam , each corresponding to an extremum in temperature .",

    "only electrons with an angle smaller than a critical angle @xmath59 can escape the potential when @xmath60 ; the others can not escape the atom , because they follow closed orbits around the atom , which are allowed by the @xmath61 potential . for @xmath62 ,",
    "all electrons can escape , so @xmath63 .",
    "when using the model with a potential appropriate for rubidium , @xmath53 can not be calculated analytically and has to be determined with simulations .",
    "due to the core electrons , the rubidium potential is no longer strictly a @xmath61 potential . as a result",
    ", all electrons with @xmath64 can eventually leave the ion .",
    "as the resulting temperatures of the model when using the hydrogen and the rubidium potential only differ a few percent at most @xcite , the former potential is used in the temperature calculations .    from the asymptotic transverse velocity @xmath53 as a function of @xmath54 ,",
    "the temperature @xmath65 can be obtained , with @xmath66 here , the factor 1/2 arises as @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the normalized initial angular distribution of the electrons , @xmath69 a weight function , and the term @xmath70 creates an uniformly filled spherical shell of electrons when @xmath71 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a uniformly distributed @xmath54 was used , so @xmath72 . however , to model the results presented in this work , we have to take into account that the electrons are preferentially ejected along the laser polarization axis : @xmath73 @xcite , which is valid when the electron orbits in the initial state before ionization ( 5@xmath11 in our case ) have no preferential orientation . here",
    "@xmath74 is the angle between the initial electron velocity and the laser polarization , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 the angle the initial electron velocity makes with the @xmath15-axis when projected in the @xmath15@xmath77-plane ( fig.[fig : setup_pol]b ) .",
    "when using the weight function @xmath73 in calculating the transverse temperature , a different temperature for the @xmath15-direction ( @xmath78 ) is found than for the @xmath77-direction ( @xmath79 ) for @xmath80 .",
    "for example for low excess energies , @xmath78 increases when increasing @xmath16 from 0 to 90@xmath81 , while @xmath79 decreases .",
    "this can be understood as electrons are then mostly ejected in the @xmath15-direction , leading to @xmath82 . however , in the experiments we do not see a difference in temperature between the @xmath15- and @xmath77-direction .",

    "an increase in the spot size corresponds to an increase in temperature , and a decrease in size in a decrease in @xmath1 .",
    "it can be seen that the normalized spot sizes both decrease by the same amount when increasing @xmath16 from @xmath84 to 180@xmath81 . for the experimental conditions of this measurement , the spot size scales approximately linearly with the source temperature , leading to the conclusion that @xmath85 .",
    "furthermore , the model curve does not have a sinusoidal dependence on polarization angle , whereas this shape has always been observed in experiments .     in the @xmath15- and @xmath77-direction ( blue squares and red circles ) as a function of polarization angle @xmath16 of the nanosecond ionization laser for @xmath36mev.[fig : spot_size_vs_polarization ] ]    in , for example , photoionization experiments on metastable xe , an asymmetry in the @xmath15@xmath77-plane plane has been observed @xcite .",
    "one major difference in the experimental setup that was used in that work is that the electrons were created in zero magnetic field . in our setup , the trapping coils , which produce the magnetic field needed for the mot , stay on during the experiment ; they produce a quadrupole magnetic field with a gradient of about 10g / cm .",
    "the magnetic field is approximately zero at the centre of the trapped atom cloud .",
    "this field could potentially turn the initial asymmetric electron distribution in a symmetric distribution , as there is a magnetic field component in the direction of the electron velocity ; this leads to a rotation of the electrons in the @xmath15@xmath77-plane .",
    "the strength of this field component is dependent on the distance to the @xmath12-axis . however , in model simulations of the electron trajectories with a magnetic field present , we have not observed that this process leads to a symmetric distribution , even when the centre of the electron cloud does not coincides with the centre of the quadrupole . the electric field profile in the accelerator , which is slightly inhomogeneous , or the energy spread in the bunch does not provide an explanation for this randomization process either .    despite the fact that we can not explain why the initial electron distribution is randomized , we account for our experimental observation of symmetry in the @xmath15@xmath77-plane by averaging the weight function @xmath86 over @xmath87 , leading to @xmath88 when using this weight function in the model , a sinusoidal oscillation of temperature as function of polarization angle is found , with @xmath85 and extreme values at @xmath47 and @xmath84 .",

    "<S> the influence has been studied of the ionization laser polarization on the effective temperature of an ultracold electron source , which is based on near - threshold photoionization . </S>",
    "<S> this source is capable of producing both high - intensity and high - coherence electron pulses , with applications in for example electron diffraction experiments . for both nanosecond and femtosecond photoionization </S>",
    "<S> , a sinusoidal dependence of the temperature on polarization angle has been found . for most experimental conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the temperature is minimal when the polarization coincides with the direction of acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> however , surprisingly , for nanosecond ionization a regime exists when the temperature is minimal when the polarization is perpendicular to the acceleration direction . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that in order to create electron bunches with the highest transverse coherence length , it is important to control the polarization of the ionization laser . </S>",
    "<S> the general trends and magnitudes of the temperature measurements are described by a model , based on the analysis of classical electron trajectories ; this model further deepens our understanding of the internal mechanisms during the photoionization process . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for nanosecond ionization , charge oscillations as a function of laser polarization have been observed ; for most situations the oscillation amplitude is small . </S>"
