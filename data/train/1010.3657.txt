    "<S> inflation is one of the most motivated scenarios for the early universe , which is consistent with the recent cosmological observations on the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large - scale structure in the universe . in order to construct a consistent model of inflation , an extension of the standard model ( sm ) </S>",

    "<S> the supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theory ( gut ) models provide a natural framework for hybrid inflation @xcite-@xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetric @xmath0 is the simplest extension of the sm which may realize hybrid inflation through the adjoint scalar field , which is responsible for breaking the @xmath0 gauge symmetry into sm gauge group @xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> inflation takes place when the system is trapped along the @xmath56 minimum . </S>",
    "<S> also , we restrict ourselves to @xmath66 , so that the inflationary trajectory at @xmath56 can be realized before @xmath54 reaches zero . therefore , the interesting region for the parameter @xmath67 in our analysis is given by @xmath68 . </S>",

    "<S> it is worth noting that the susy breaking along the inflationary trajectory , which is due to the non zero vacuum energy @xmath86 , generates a mass splitting in @xmath76 supermultiplet and in @xmath87 , @xmath83 , supermultiplets . </S>",
    "<S> this is the only place where mass splitting between fermions and bosons appears .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath41-term contribution to the masses of scalar fields @xmath87 , @xmath88 , is obtained from the following term : g ^2 ( f^ijk _ j ^_k ) ( f^ilm _ l ^_m),where @xmath89 is the @xmath0 gauge coupling . as an example , we obtain the mass of @xmath90 field as follows : g ^2 ( f^92410 v_2 _ 10+f^91024 v_2 ^_10 ) ^2 , which leads to mass - squared @xmath91 using @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 . thus , the d term contributes with a universal mass - squared @xmath91 for the above mentioned @xmath95 real scalar fields . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing between chiral fermions @xmath85 , @xmath96 , and the gauginos @xmath97 , @xmath96 , gives rise to dirac mass term : i g f^ijk ( ^_k _ i _ </S>",
