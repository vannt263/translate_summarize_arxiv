    "the upcoming start of physics runs at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has added impetus to the long - standing quest to improve theoretical control over standard - model backgrounds to new physics searches at hadron colliders .",
    "some backgrounds can be understood without much theoretical input .",
    "for example , a light higgs boson decaying into two photons produces a narrow bump in the di - photon invariant mass , from which the large but smooth qcd background can be subtracted experimentally using sideband information .",
    "however , for many searches the signals are excesses in broader distributions of jets , along with missing energy and charged leptons or photons ; such searches require a much more detailed theoretical understanding of the qcd backgrounds .",
    "a classic example is the production of a higgs boson in association with a @xmath0 boson at the tevatron , with the higgs decaying to a @xmath1 pair , and the @xmath0 decaying to a charged lepton and a neutrino .",
    "the peak in the @xmath1 invariant mass is much broader than in the di - photon one ; therefore variations in the backgrounds , including qcd production of @xmath2 , across the signal region are more difficult to assess .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on a related important class of backgrounds , production of multiple ( untagged ) jets in association with a @xmath0 boson . such events , with a leptonically decaying @xmath0 , form a background to supersymmetry searches at the lhc that require a lepton , missing transverse energy and jets  @xcite . if the lepton is missed , they also contribute to the background for similar searches not requiring a lepton .",
    "the rate of events containing a @xmath0 along with multiple jets can be used to calibrate the corresponding rate for @xmath3 production with multiple jets , which form another important source of missing transverse energy when the @xmath3 decays to a pair of neutrinos .",
    "analysis of @xmath0 plus multi - jet production will also assist in separating these events from the production of top - quark pairs , so that more detailed studies of the latter can be performed .",
    "the first step toward a theoretical understanding of qcd backgrounds is the evaluation of the cross section at leading order ( lo ) in the strong coupling @xmath4 .",
    "our particular focus is on high jet multiplicity in association with vector boson production .",
    "many computer codes  @xcite are available to generate predictions at leading order .",
    "some of the codes incorporate higher - multiplicity leading - order matrix elements into parton showering programs  @xcite , using matching ( or merging ) procedures  @xcite .",
    "lo predictions suffer from large renormalization- and factorization - scale dependence , growing with increasing jet multiplicity , and already up to a factor of two in the processes we shall study . next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections are necessary to obtain quantitatively reliable predictions .",
    "they typically display a greatly reduced scale dependence  @xcite .",
    "fixed - order results at nlo can also be matched to parton showers .",
    "this has been done for a growing list of processes within the mc@nlo program and the powheg method  @xcite .",
    "it would be desirable to extend this matching to higher - multiplicity processes such as those we discuss in the present paper .",
    "the production of massive vector bosons in association with jets at hadron colliders has been the subject of theoretical studies for over three decades .",
    "early studies were of large transverse - momentum muon - pair production at leading order  @xcite , followed by the leading - order matrix elements for -jet production  @xcite and corresponding phenomenological studies  @xcite .",
    "the early leading - order studies were followed by nlo predictions for vector boson production in association with a single jet  @xcite .",
    "leading - order results for vector - boson production accompanied by three or four jets appeared soon thereafter  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical studies played an important role in the discovery of the top quark  @xcite .",
    "modern matrix element generators  @xcite allow for even larger numbers of final - state jets at lo .",
    "the one - loop matrix elements for -jet and -jet production were determined  @xcite via the unitarity method  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and incorporated into the parton - level mcfm  @xcite code .",
    "studies of @xmath0 production in association with heavy quarks have also been performed .",
    "nlo results for hadronic production of a @xmath0 and a charm quark first appeared in ref .",
    "more recently , nlo results have been presented for @xmath5jet production  @xcite , as well as for @xmath6 production with full @xmath7 quark mass effects  @xcite .",
    "the last two computations were combined to produce a full description of @xmath0 production in association with a single @xmath7-jet in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nlo studies of @xmath0 production in association with more jets have long been desirable .",
    "however , a bottleneck to these studies was posed by one - loop amplitudes involving six or more partons  @xcite . on - shell methods  @xcite , which exploit unitarity and recursion relations , have successfully broken this bottleneck , by avoiding gauge - noninvariant intermediate steps , and reducing the problem to much smaller elements analogous to tree - level amplitudes .",
    "approaches based on feynman diagrams have also led to new results with six external partons , exemplified by the nlo cross section for producing @xmath8 at hadron colliders  @xcite .",
    "we expect that on - shell methods will be particularly advantageous for processes involving many external gluons , which often dominate multi - jet final states .",
    "various results  @xcite already indicate the suitability of these methods for a general - purpose numerical approach to high - multiplicity one - loop amplitudes .",
    "we recently presented the first nlo results for -jet production including all subprocesses  @xcite , using one - loop amplitudes obtained by on - shell methods .",
    "this study used a specific type of leading - color approximation designed to have small corrections  under 3 percent , as verified in -jet production  while reducing the required computer time .",
    "the study was performed for the tevatron , with the same cuts employed by the cdf collaboration in their measurement of -jet production  @xcite .",
    "the nlo corrections show a much - reduced dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales , and excellent agreement with the cdf data for the distribution in the transverse energy @xmath9 of the third - most energetic jet .",
    "in the present paper , we continue our study of -jet production .",
    "we present results for -jet production at the lhc as well as at the tevatron . as before",
    ", we include all subprocesses and take all quarks to be massless .",
    "( we do not include top - quark contributions , but expect them to be very small for the distributions we shall present . )",
    "we extend the previous results by including specific virtual contributions that are subleading in the number of colors , which we had previously neglected .",
    "we shall demonstrate that , as expected , these subleading - color corrections to cross sections and distributions are uniformly small , generally under three percent .",
    "we present three sets of distributions at the tevatron : the @xmath9 of the third most energetic jet , the total transverse energy @xmath10",
    "@xcite , and the di - jet invariant masses .",
    "these distributions are again computed with the same cuts used by cdf .",
    "( as discussed further in , we used the infrared - safe siscone jet algorithm  @xcite in place of jetclu , the cone algorithm used by cdf . ) the code we use is general - purpose , permitting the analysis at nlo of any infrared - safe observable in -jet events .",
    "we also present a wide variety of distributions for the ultimate lhc energy of 14  tev .",
    "we find that all the nlo cross sections and distributions display the expected reduction in renormalization- and factorization - scale dependence compared to the same quantities calculated at leading order .",
    "the shapes of distributions at leading order are quite sensitive to the functional form of the scale choice .",
    "as expected , the change in shape between lo and nlo distributions can be reduced by choosing typical energy scales event - by - event for the renormalization and factorization scales , as noted by many authors over the years  @xcite . the vector boson transverse energy @xmath11 , employed as an event - by - event scale in previous predictions and comparisons with data  @xcite , turns out to be a poor characterization of the typical energy scale for events with large jet transverse energies , as at the lhc .",
    "we find that the total partonic transverse energy is a much better choice .",
    "recently , similar deficiencies in the scale choice of @xmath11 at lo have been observed independently , and another variable , related to the invariant mass of the final - state jets , has been proposed as a replacement  @xcite .",
    "here we go further and demonstrate that for lhc energies , @xmath11 is a poor scale choice not only at lo but also at nlo , yielding negative differential cross sections in the tails of some distributions .",
    "this pathology arises from large residual logarithms induced by disparities between momentum - transfer scales in multi - jet processes and the value of @xmath11 .    for -jet production , choosing the total partonic transverse energy as the scale gives rise to shapes of distributions at lo that are typically similar to those at nlo . for a few -jet distributions genuine nlo effects",
    "are present , and significant shape changes remain between lo and nlo .",
    "these differences are usually less pronounced than in -jet production . in the latter cases ,",
    "the lo kinematics are more constrained , leading to significantly larger nlo corrections . in any event",
    ", an accurate description of the shape of any distribution requires an nlo computation , either to confirm that its shape is unmodified compared to lo , or to quantitatively determine the shape change .",
    "ellis _ et al .",
    "_ have recently presented partial nlo results for -jet production .",
    "their first calculation  @xcite was restricted to leading - color contributions to two - quark subprocesses , rendering it unsuitable for phenomenological studies .",
    "their version of the leading - color approximation drops subleading - color terms in both the virtual and real - emission contributions .",
    "quite recently  @xcite the same authors have added the leading - color contributions from four - quark processes , folding in the decay of the @xmath0 in the zero - width approximation .",
    "they extended their leading - color approximation to include @xmath12-dependent terms , and estimated the full - color result based on the leading - order ratio of the full - color ( fc ) and leading - color ( lc ) cross sections .",
    "the value of the double ratio @xmath13 they use implicitly is quite sensitive to the inclusion of @xmath12 terms , and as noted by the authors , sensitive to cancellations between the two - quark and four - quark contributions .",
    "it is nonetheless interesting that their estimate for the total cross section is within a few percent of both our earlier result  @xcite and the full - color one presented in this paper",
    ". it would be interesting to test their estimates for various distributions against the complete results presented here ; we leave such a comparison to future work .",
    "next - to - leading order cross sections are built from several ingredients : virtual corrections , computed from the interference of tree - level and one - loop amplitudes ; real - emission corrections ; and a mechanism for isolating and integrating the infrared singularities in the latter .",
    "we evaluate the one - loop amplitudes needed for -jet production at nlo using the blackhat library  @xcite . this library implements on - shell methods for one - loop amplitudes numerically .",
    "related methods have been implemented in several other programs  @xcite . a numerical approach to amplitudes",
    "requires attention to numerical instabilities induced by round - off error .",
    "we have previously verified blackhat s stability for one - loop six- , seven- and eight - gluon amplitudes  @xcite , and for leading - color amplitudes for a vector boson with up to five partons  @xcite , using a flat distribution of phase - space points . in the present work ,",
    "we confirm the stability of blackhat - computed matrix elements for an ensemble of points chosen in the same way as in the actual numerical integration of the cross section .",
    "the real - emission corrections to the lo process arise from tree - level amplitudes with one additional parton : an additional gluon , or a quark ",
    "antiquark pair replacing a gluon . to isolate and cancel the infrared divergences that arise in the integration of these terms , we use the catani ",
    "seymour dipole subtraction method  @xcite , as implemented  @xcite in the program  amegic++  @xcite , itself part of the sherpa framework  @xcite .",
    "( we also use amegic++ for the required tree - level matrix elements . ) other automated implementations of the dipole subtraction method have been presented recently  @xcite .    the smallness of the subleading - color corrections to the specific leading - color approximation employed in ref .",
    "@xcite allows us to use a `` color - expansion sampling '' approach  @xcite . in this approach the subleading - color terms , while more time - consuming per phase - space point , are sampled with lower statistics than the leading - color ones , and therefore do not impose an undue burden on the computer time required .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we summarize our calculational setup , and demonstrate the numerical stability of the one - loop matrix elements .",
    "in we present results for the tevatron , using the same experimental cuts as cdf . in",
    "we discuss scale choices , showing that the choice of @xmath0 transverse energy typically used for tevatron studies can lead to significant distortions in the shapes of distributions over the broader range of kinematics accessible at the lhc .",
    "we advocate instead the use of scale choices that more accurately reflect typical energy scales in the process , such as the total partonic transverse energy , or a fixed fraction of it . in , we present a wide variety of distributions for the lhc .",
    "we highlight two particular topics in subsequent sections .",
    "section  [ leptonsection ] examines properties of the leptons produced by @xmath0 decay in jet events .",
    "the different pseudorapidity distributions for electrons and positrons are presented .",
    "then we show the ratios , between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , of the transverse energy distributions for both the charged leptons and neutrinos .",
    "these two ratios have strikingly different behavior at large @xmath9 , presumably due to the effects of @xmath0 polarization .",
    "in we present results for the jet - emission probability , as a function of the pseudorapidity separation of the leading two jets .",
    "these results are relevant for searches for the higgs boson in vector - boson fusion production . in , we discuss the specific leading - color approximation used in our previous study , and our approach to computing the subleading - color terms .",
    "we give our conclusions in .",
    "finally , in an appendix we give values of squared matrix elements at a selected point in phase space .",
    "at nlo , the -jet computation can be divided into four distinct contributions :    * the leading - order contribution , requiring the tree - level @xmath16-parton matrix elements ; * the virtual contribution , requiring the one - loop @xmath16-parton matrix elements ( built from the interference of one - loop and tree amplitudes ) ; * the subtracted real - emission contribution , requiring the tree - level @xmath17-parton matrix elements , an approximation capturing their singular behavior , and integration of the difference over the additional - emission phase space ; * the integrated approximation ( real - subtraction term ) , whose infrared - singular terms must cancel the infrared singularities in the virtual contribution .",
    "we evaluate these different contributions using a number of tools .",
    "we compute the virtual corrections using on - shell methods , implemented numerically in blackhat , as outlined below .",

    "as noted below , we use the same setup for the results we report for -jet production .      to compute the production of jets at nlo , we need the one - loop amplitudes for the processes listed in",
    ". amplitudes in gauge theories are naturally decomposed into a sum over permutations of terms ; each term is the product of a color factor and a color - independent kinematic factor called a partial or color - ordered amplitude .",
    "it is convenient to decompose the one - loop amplitudes further , into a set of _ primitive _ amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "these are the basic gauge - invariant building blocks of the amplitude , in which the ordering of all colored external legs is fixed , the direction of fermion lines within the loop is fixed , and @xmath12 terms arising from fermion loops are separated out . in blackhat ,",
    "the primitive amplitudes are computed directly using the on - shell methods reviewed in the next subsection .",
    "the primitive amplitudes are then combined to obtain the partial amplitudes .",
    "the virtual contributions are assembled by summing over interferences of the one - loop partial amplitudes with their tree - level counterparts .    in organizing the amplitude , it is useful to keep the numbers of colors @xmath28 and of flavors @xmath12 as parameters , setting them to their standard - model values only upon evaluation .",

    "they can be obtained from the diagrams shown by moving vertices off of the loop onto trees attached to the loop , or by using four - gluon vertices , while preserving the cyclic ( color ) ordering of the external legs and the planar topology of the diagram . in the leading - color primitive amplitudes",
    ", the @xmath0 boson is between the @xmath20 and @xmath21 external legs , with no other partons in between .    in subleading - color terms ,",
    "a greater number and variety of primitive amplitudes appear , and some primitive amplitudes contribute to more than one subleading - color partial amplitude .",
    "a few of the parent diagrams for subleading - color primitive amplitudes are shown in . in such diagrams , either another parton appears between the @xmath0 boson and either @xmath20 or @xmath21 , or a gluon is emitted between @xmath26 and @xmath36 in process  ( [ w3qqqqg ] ) , or the diagram contains a closed fermion loop . in the present paper , we include _ all _ subleading - color contributions . in , we discuss in greater detail how to evaluate the full virtual cross section efficiently , by taking advantage of the smallness of the subleading - color contributions .      the computation of one - loop partonic amplitudes has presented until recently a bottleneck to nlo predictions for hadronic production of four or more final - state objects ( jets included ) . the on - shell method has broken this bottleneck .",
    "this approach is based on the unitarity method  @xcite , including its newer refinements , together with on - shell recursion relations  @xcite at one loop  @xcite . the refinements  @xcite rely on the use of complex momenta , generalized unitarity and the analytic structure of integrands , as well as subtractions to make efficient use of the known basis of one - loop integrals .",
    "the one - loop matrix elements  @xcite used by the mcfm program  @xcite for nlo predictions of -jet production were computed analytically using an early version of this approach , and indeed served to introduce the use of generalized unitarity  @xcite as an efficient technique for loop computations .",

    "we speed up the on - shell recursion by explicitly evaluating some spurious poles analytically .",
    "both approaches are used for our evaluation of the -jet virtual matrix elements . for producing the plots in this paper",

    "( as described in , in performing the phase - space integration we sample a single subprocess at each point . ) using the `` color - expansion sampling '' approach we shall discuss in , evaluating the subleading - color contributions would multiply this time by about 2.4 , giving an average evaluation time of 1.1  s for the full color calculation .",
    "blackhat computes matrix elements numerically using on - shell methods . in certain regions of phase space , particularly near the vanishing loci of gram determinants associated with the scalar integrals @xmath41 , there can be large cancellations between different terms in the expansion  ( [ integralbasis ] ) of the cut part @xmath37 , or between the cut part and the rational part @xmath38 in .",
    "there can also be numerical instabilities in individual terms .",
    "for example , the recursive evaluation of @xmath38 includes a contribution from residues at spurious poles in the complex plane .",
    "these residues are computed by sampling points near the pole , in an approximation to a contour integral which can be spoiled if another pole is nearby .    in normal operation , blackhat performs a series of tests to detect any unacceptable loss of precision .",
    "whenever blackhat detects such a loss , it re - evaluates the problematic contributions to the amplitude ( and only those terms ) at that phase - space point using higher - precision arithmetic ( performed by the qd package  @xcite ) .",
    "this approach avoids the need to analyze in detail the precise origin of instabilities and to devise workarounds for each case .",
    "it does of course require that results be sufficiently stable , so that the use of higher precision is infrequent enough to incur only a modest increase in the overall evaluation time ; this is indeed the case .",
    "the simplest test of stability is checking whether the known infrared singularity of a given matrix element has been reproduced correctly . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , this check can be extended naturally to check individual spurious - pole residues .",
    "another test checks the accuracy of the vanishing of certain higher - rank tensor coefficients . from the interaction terms in the ( renormalizable ) qcd lagrangian we know on general grounds which high - rank tensor coefficients have to vanish .",

    "if the integral corresponds to a cut line that is fermionic , then the maximum rank is reduced by one . in our approach the values of the higher - rank tensor coefficients",
    "may be computed without much extra cost in computation time . for a given generalized unitarity cut , when using complex loop - momentum parametrizations along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , these tensor coefficients appear as coefficients of specific monomials in the complex parameters . their values may be extracted as a byproduct of evaluating the scalar integral coefficients .",
    "similarly , in the massive continuation approach to computing the rational terms , particular tensor coefficients can be associated with specific monomials in the complex parameters and in an auxiliary complex mass parameter entering the loop - momentum parametrization .",
    "we apply the latter check when computing coefficients of scalar bubble integrals , as well as bubble contributions to the rational terms in the massive continuation approach .",
    "the value of this check is twofold .",
    "firstly , it focuses on a small part of the computation , namely single bubble coefficients .",
    "this allows blackhat to recompute at higher precision just the numerically - unstable contributions , instead of the entire amplitude .",
    "by contrast , the above - mentioned check of the infrared singularity assesses the precision of the entire cut part @xmath37 of the given primitive amplitude , and so it requires more recomputation if it fails .",
    "secondly , the check applied to the bubble contributions in the massive continuation approach assesses the precision of the rational part @xmath38 , which is inaccessible to the infrared - singularity check .",
    "we have previously assessed the numerical stability of blackhat for six- , seven- and eight - gluon one - loop amplitudes  @xcite , as well as for the leading - color amplitudes for a vector boson with up to five partons  @xcite used in the present study .",
    "these earlier studies used a flat phase - space distribution . here",
    "we show the stability of blackhat over phase - space points selected in the same way as in the computation of cross sections and distributions .",
    "as will be discussed in  , the phase - space points are selected using an integration grid that has been adapted to the leading - order cross section .     and @xmath51 .",
    "the phase - space points are selected in the same way as those used to compute cross sections at the lhc .",
    "the horizontal axis is the logarithm of the relative error  ( [ relerror ] ) between an evaluation by blackhat , running in production mode , and a target expression evaluated using higher precision with at least @xmath52 decimal digits ( or up to @xmath53 decimal digits for unstable points ) .",
    "the vertical axis shows the number of events out of 100,000 with the corresponding error .",
    "the dashed ( black ) line shows the @xmath54 term ; the solid ( red ) curve , the @xmath55 term ; and the shaded ( blue ) curve , the finite ( @xmath56 ) term . ]    in , we illustrate the numerical stability of the leading - color virtual interference term ( or squared matrix element ) , @xmath57 , summed over colors and over all helicity configurations for two subprocesses , @xmath58 and @xmath51 .",
    "( the grid here has been adapted to each of the subprocesses individually , instead of to the sum over subprocesses . )",
    "we have checked that the other subprocesses are similarly stable .",
    "the horizontal axis of shows the logarithmic error , @xmath59 for each of the three components : @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the dimensional regularization parameter .",
    "the targets have been computed by blackhat using multiprecision arithmetic with at least @xmath52 decimal digits , and @xmath53 if the point is deemed unstable . the overwhelming majority ( 99.9% ) of events",
    "are computed to better than one part in @xmath64  that is , to the left of the ` @xmath65 ' mark on the horizontal axis .",
    "we have also examined distributions in which each bin is weighted by the requisite squared matrix element and jacobian factors .",
    "we find that they have quite similar shapes to the unweighted distributions shown in .",
    "this implies that the few events with a relative error larger than @xmath66 make only a small contribution to the total cross section .",
    "we have verified that the difference between normal and high - precision evaluation in the total cross section , as well as bin by bin for all distributions studied , is at least three orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding numerical integration error .",
    "in addition to the virtual corrections to the cross section provided by blackhat , an nlo calculation also requires the real - emission corrections to the lo process .",
    "these terms arise from tree - level amplitudes with one additional parton : an additional gluon , or a quark ",
    "antiquark pair replacing a gluon .",
    "representative real - emission diagrams are shown in .",
    "infrared singularities develop when the extra parton momentum is integrated over phase - space regions unresolved by the jet algorithm or jet cuts .",
    "the resulting singular integrals cancel against singular terms in the virtual corrections , and against counter - terms associated with the evolution of parton distributions . as mentioned above , to carry out these cancellations , we use the catani ",
    "seymour dipole subtraction method  @xcite as implemented  @xcite in the program  amegic++  @xcite , which is part of the sherpa framework  @xcite .",
    "this implementation of dipole subtraction has already been tested  @xcite in explicit comparisons against the disent program  @xcite .",
    "the implementation introduces two free parameters , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the first , @xmath69 , parametrizes the volume of phase space to be cut out around the soft or collinear singularity . from an analytic point of view",
    ", @xmath69 could be taken to zero , as the cancellation of counter - terms against the matrix element s singularities is exact . in numerical implementations , however , round - off error can spoil this cancellation .",
    "previous studies have shown that the final result is independent of this cut - off parameter once it is sufficiently small  @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath71 .",
    "the second parameter , @xmath70 , characterizes a common modification of subtraction terms in phase space _",
    "away _ from the singularity @xcite , restricting the support of a given subtraction term to the vicinity of its singularity .",
    "this allows the program to compute only a subset of dipole terms , as many will now be identically zero at a given phase - space point . because the number of dipole terms is large ( scaling as @xmath72 for processes containing @xmath48 partons ) , this reduces the computational burden considerably .",
    "we run our code with several different values of @xmath70 , and check the independence of the final result on the value of @xmath70 ( @xmath73 ) . for example , the lhc @xmath15 results for @xmath74 agree with those for @xmath75 to better than half a percent , within the integration errors .",
    "we have also run a large number of other lower - statistics checks demonstrating that cross sections are independent of the choice of @xmath70 .",
    "our default choice for the lhc is @xmath74 , while for the tevatron it is @xmath75 .      along with the automated generation of matrix elements and dipole terms",
    ", sherpa also provides monte carlo integration methods .",
    "the phase - space generator combines _ a priori _ knowledge about the behavior of the integrands in phase space with self - adaptive integration methods .",
    "it employs a multi - channel method in the spirit of ref .",
    "single channels ( phase - space parametrizations ) are generated by amegic++ together with the tree - level matrix elements .",
    "each parametrization reflects the structure of a feynman amplitude , roughly reproducing its resonances , decay kinematics , and its soft and collinear structure .",
    "the most important phase - space parametrizations , determined by the adapted relative weight within the multi - channel setup , are further refined using vegas  @xcite .",
    "the phase - space optimization ( adaptation of channel weights and vegas grids ) is performed in independent runs before the actual computation starts .",
    "the optimization is done on the sum of all contributing parton - level processes .",
    "we refer collectively to all the parameters of the optimization as the integration grid .",
    "separate integration grids are constructed for the lo terms and for the real - emission contributions . to integrate the virtual contributions , we re - use the grid constructed for the lo terms .",
    "this procedure avoids the computational expense of evaluating the virtual terms merely for grid construction .",
    "the virtual to lo ratio is sufficiently flat across phase space that this results in only a slight inefficiency when evaluating distributions .    following the initialization phase ,",
    "the integration grids are frozen . in the ensuing production phase , we sample over subprocesses so that only a single parton - level subprocess is evaluated per phase - space point , selected with a probability proportional to its contribution to the total cross section .",
    "we choose to integrate the real - emission terms over about @xmath76 phase - space points , the leading - color virtual parts over @xmath77 phase - space points and the subleading - color virtual parts over @xmath78 phase - space points .",
    "the lo and real - subtraction pieces are run separately with @xmath79 points each .",
    "these numbers are chosen to achieve a total integration error of half a percent or less . for a given choice of scale @xmath24 ,",
    "they give comparable running times for the real - emission and virtual contributions .",
    "running times for leading- and subleading - color virtual contributions are also comparable .",
    "we work to leading order in the electroweak coupling and approximate the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix by the unit matrix .",
    "this approximation causes a rather small change in total cross sections for the cuts we impose , as estimated by lo evaluations using the full ckm matrix . at the tevatron ,",
    "the full ckm results are about one percent smaller than with the unit ckm matrix ; the difference is even smaller at the lhc .",
    "we express the @xmath0-boson couplings to fermions using the standard model input parameters shown in .",
    "the parameter @xmath80 is derived from the others via , @xmath81         we quote numerical results for the ultraviolet - renormalized virtual corrections in the t  hooft - veltman variant of dimensional regularization  @xcite .",
    "the remaining singularities in the dimensional regularization parameter @xmath82 arise from the virtual soft and collinear singularities in the one - loop amplitudes .",
    "the quoted values are for the ratio of the virtual corrections to the tree - level squared matrix element @xmath83 .",
    "explicitly , we define the ratio , @xmath84 where we have also separated out the dependence on the strong coupling @xmath4 and the overall factor @xmath85 , defined by @xmath86 the coupling constants , mass and width of the @xmath0 boson are given in .",
    "however , the numerical values for the ratio  ( [ me2normalization ] ) , given in , are independent of these parameters ; coupling constants as well as the @xmath0 boson breit - wigner factor cancel between the tree and virtual correction terms .",
