    "in this section we review the data analysis technique to be used to detect a stochastic background of gravitational radiation .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "first , we limit attention to backgrounds which are cosmological in origin and thus can be assumed to be isotropic , unpolarized , gaussian , and stationary .",
    "subject to these assumptions , the stochastic gravitational - wave ( gw ) background is completely described by its power spectrum .",
    "it is conventional to express this spectrum in terms of the gw contribution to the cosmological parameter @xmath0 : @xmath1 note that @xmath2 has been constructed to be dimensionless , and represents the contribution to the overall @xmath3 per _ logarithmic _ frequency interval . in particular , it is _ not _ equivalent to @xmath4 .",
    "note also that since the critical density @xmath5 , which is used in the normalization of @xmath2 , is proportional to the square of the hubble constant @xmath6 @xcite , it is convenient to work with @xmath7 , which is independent of the observationally determined value of @xmath8 .",
    "since a stochastic signal is by definition random , it is impractical to look for one in the output of a single gravitational wave detector @xcite .",
    "however , the effects of such a signal can be detected by cross - correlating the outputs of two independent detectors .",
    "if the output @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) of the first ( second ) detector consists of a term @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) due to stochastic gravitational waves and a term @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) due to instrument noise , and the noise in each instrument is assumed to be uncorrelated both with the gw signal and the noise in the other instrument , the only surviving term in a time averaged correlation @xmath15 is the term @xmath16 due to the gravitational wave background .    in practice , one defines a _ cross - correlation statistic _",
    "@xmath17 which is weighted by a filter @xmath18 . in the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave signal , both the mean @xmath19 and variance @xmath20 of the cross - correlation statistic will grow linearly with time , so the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath21 will grow as the square root of the observation time .    given a gw background spectrum and a pair of detectors , the signal - to - noise ratio is maximized by using the _ optimal filter _",
    "@xmath22 the denominator , containing the power spectral densities @xmath23 of the noise in the two detectors , serves to suppress the contributions to the cross - correlation statistic from frequencies where one or both detectors are `` noisy '' and most correlations are therefore likely to be accidental .",
    "the numerator represents the average unweighted cross - correlation between the outputs of two detectors , and depends on both the spectrum @xmath2 of the expected gravitational wave background and the locations and orientations of the two detectors .",
    "the latter is described by the _ overlap reduction function _",
    "@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the overlap reduction function is equal to unity for the case of a pair of interferometers ( ifos ) at the same location with their arms aligned , and is suppressed as the detectors are rotated out of alignment or separated from one another .",
    "the frequency dependence comes about for the following reason : if the wavelength of a wave is comparable to or smaller than the separation between two detectors , the detectors will see different phases of the wave at the same time , and this phase difference will depend on the direction of propagation of the wave . since the stochastic gw background is assumed to be isotropic ,",
    "averaging over different propagation directions suppresses the sensitivity of a pair of detectors to high - frequency waves .",
    "for example , a wave whose wavelength is twice the distance between the two detectors will drive them @xmath25 out of phase if it travels along the line separating them , but _ in _ phase if its direction of propagation is perpendicular to this line .",
    "figure  [ fig : overlap ] shows the overlap reduction functions for several detectors of interest .",
    "away from this.,height=336 ]      in early data analysis applications , cross - correlated noise is likely to produce considerable spurious contributions to the integral ( [ eq : ccstat ] ) . a useful diagnostic tool will thus be the _ cross - correlation spectrum _",
    "@xmath26 which is simply the integrand of ( [ eq : ccstat ] ) ; this may enable us to see directly the impact of these cross - correlated noise sources on the cross - correlation statistic .",
    "a two - week engineering run for the ligo ifos is planned for around the end of 2001 , involving the kilometer - scale ifos in livingston , louisiana @xcite and hanford , washington @xcite .",
    "the 600 meter geo ifo @xcite in hannover , germany and the allegro @xcite resonant bar detector at louisiana state university are also planning to operate during the same two - week period .",
    "four groups have been formed to use the data taken from ligo and the other instruments to set upper limits on various types of gw signals , including stochastic signals @xcite .",
    "the stochastic group plans to set an upper limit on the strength of a stochastic background , assuming it has the form @xmath27 , with the goal of improving on the existing best upper limit of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the roles to be played by various pairs of detectors in this effort are largely driven by their separation and alignment relative to one another , as quantified by the overlap reduction function ( see figure  [ fig : overlap ] ) .",
    "the distance between the two ligo sites is approximately 3000 km , which makes the light - travel time between the two sites about 10 ms .",
    "thus the two sites are separated by half a wavelength for waves with a frequency of 50  hz , and as shown in figure  [ fig : overlap ] the overlap reduction function first crosses zero at a slightly higher frequency .",
    "so the overlap reduction function limits the sensitivity of this pair of detectors at high frequencies ; below around 40  hz , the seismic noise in the detectors will squash the optimal filter ( [ eq : optfilt ] ) .",
    "the net effect ( as illustrated in figure  21 of @xcite ) is that for ligo initial design sensitivity , most of the support of the optimal filter lies between 50 and 250  hz .",
    "the allegro bar detector is far closer to the ligo livingston site than the ligo hanford site is , with only about 40 km separating the two and a `` half - wavelength '' frequency of 3750  hz . thus the observing geometry allows for observations of correlations out to much higher frequencies . on the other hand ,",
    "the sensitivity of allegro is concentrated in two narrow frequency bands in the vicinity of 900  hz , so correlations between allegro and ligo livingston probe a different part of the frequency domain than correlations between the two ligo detectors .",
    "since the geo-600 detector is rather distant from the ligo sites ( over 7500  km from livingston , corresponding to a `` half - wavelength '' frequency of only 20  hz ) , the small overlap reduction function will render the geo-600/ligo - la pair ( the better of the two ) considerably less sensitive to gravitational waves than the ligo - la / ligo - wa pair .",
    "the primary interest in performing this correlation is thus the information it will provide about cross - correlated noise rather than a contribution to the upper limit on stochastic background strength .",
    "the data analysis technique described in section  [ sec : techniques ] will be implemented within the ligo data analysis system ( ldas ) @xcite using c routines from the ligo numerical algorithms library ( lal ) @xcite .",
    "we have written and tested lal routines to perform the various parts of the analysis ( calculating the overlap reduction function , constructing the optimal filter , etc . ) .",
    "care has been taken to make these routines general enough to be applied to both ifo data ( e.g. , from ligo and geo ) and data from resonant bar detectors such as allegro .",
    "two major issues have required some care in this regard :    first , the treatment of detector geometry ( used in constructing the optimal filter ) needed to be general enough to describe both interferometric and resonant detectors .",
    "this was accomplished by defining a data structure within lal which described an idealized earthbound detector in terms of its location and tensor response to gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "second , since the sensitivity band of allegro is at a relatively high frequency compared to its bandwidth , its gravitational wave signal is heterodyned before being discretely sampled @xcite . by multiplying the time - domain signal by a complex exponential oscillating at a base frequency , one effectively shifts the frequency band represented in the discrete signal ( whose full width is equal to the sampling frequency ) so that it is centered at the base frequency rather than at dc ( 0  hz ) . to allow for this , the lal routines had to be written to deal with complex as well as real time series .",
    "the interface between the c@xmath29 ldas environment and the lal c library is known as lalwrapper @xcite .",
    "lalwrapper contains a number of dynamically - linked shared objects which can be used to `` drive '' various search algorithms in lal .",
    "we have written two lalwrapper shared objects : ` libldasstochastic.so ` calculates the cross - correlation spectrum ( [ eq : ccspec ] ) between two interferometric detectors , and ` libldasstochasticbar.so ` does the same for correlations between an ifo and a resonant bar detector .",
    "( eventually , we plan to integrate the functionality into a single , generalized search engine . )",
    "the general behavior of lalwrapper code is to execute parallel searches on one or more nodes of a beowulf cluster @xcite , with each `` slave '' node reporting to the `` master '' node at least ten times .",
    "both stochastic background search engines use the following algorithm to calculate cross - correlation spectra for a sequence of short consecutive time intervals :    1 .",
    "equal - length stretches of data from a pair of detectors are input , along with power spectra and response functions , and some search parameters",
    "the data streams are each divided into ten or more shorter - length segments .",
    "an optimal filter is constructed using the auxiliary inputs and parameters describing the choice of detectors , etc .",
    "4 .   in turn , each corresponding pair of data segments is fourier - transformed and the cross - correlation spectrum calculated using the optimal filter .",
    "enhancements to be made for the scientific data runs which will begin in 2002 include : ( i ) rather than constructing a single optimal filter based on the @xmath27 model , we will choose a set of points in the parameter space of stochastic background models@xcite and filter the data in parallel with a `` grid '' of optimal filters , one optimized according to ( [ eq : optfilt ] ) for each @xmath2 model @xcite ; ( ii ) to set an upper limit or make a measurement of the strength of the stochastic background , we will calculate the cross - correlation statistic for the whole data stream(s ) by integrating the cross - correlation spectrum for a given segment over frequency and then adding the contributions from all the segments .",
    "the shared objects ` libldasstochastic.so ` and ` libldasstochasticbar.so ` were among the data analysis routines tested at the burst - stochastic mock data challenge@xcite , held at the massachusetts institute of technology 4 - 10 september 2001 .",
    "the shared object for ifo - ifo correlations was tested with trivial and non - trivial synthetic data and produced the expected results in each case ; it was also used to analyze 15 minutes of data taken by the two ligo ifos during a recent engineering run , to verify that it could do so without failing .",
    "the ifo - bar shared object , being slightly less mature , was not tested as extensively .",
    "however , some of the tests which were run produced unexpected results which appear to be due to the use of single precision arithmetic in several lal routines .",
    "the finer frequency resolution required by the sharp spectral features in the bar response function may require the use of double precision .",
    "we would like to thank our colleagues in ligo and the larger gravitational wave community who have made this work possible , especially : b.  allen and the authors of the grasp routines from which many lal routines are derived ; s.  drasco and  .",
