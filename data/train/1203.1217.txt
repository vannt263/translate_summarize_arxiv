    "quantum hall effect and radiation - matter coupling@xcite are two of the most remarkable topics in condensed matter physics .",
    "accordingly , transport excited by radiation in a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) has been always a central topic in basic and applied research . in the last decade",
    "it was discovered that when a 2des in a perpendicular magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) is irradiated , mainly with microwaves ( mw ) , some striking effects are revealed : radiation - induced magnetoresistance ( @xmath1 ) oscillations and zero resistance states ( zrs ) @xcite .",
    "these remarkable effects show up at low @xmath0 and high mobility samples .",
    "it is important to achieve a complete understanding of the physical mechanisms being responsible of them and not only for the basic knowledge purpose but also for the potential applications in nanoelectronics .",
    "different theories have been proposed to explain these effects @xcite but the physical origin is still being questioned . in the same way , a great effort has also been made from the experimental side @xcite .",
    "of course the obtained experimental results always mean a real challenge for the existent theoretical models .",
    "therefore , a comparison of experiment with theory could help to identify the importance of the different approaches in these theories .",
    "thus , as an example , it has been recently published experimental results on the dependence of the oscillations with radiation power@xcite where a very solid result has been obtained in terms of a sublinear relation , similar to a square root . yet",
    ", some theories predicted a linear dependence@xcite between @xmath1 oscillations and radiation power .",
    "one of the most interesting and challenging experimental result , recently obtained@xcite and as intriguing as zrs , consists in a strong resistance spike which shows up far off - resonance .",
    "it occurs at twice the cyclotron frequency , @xmath2@xcite , were @xmath3 is the radiation frequency and @xmath4 the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the amplitude of such a spike is very large reaching an order of magnitude regarding the radiation - induced @xmath1 oscillations . in the same experiments it is",
    "also reported the behavior of the resistance spike with different radiation frequencies , temperature ( @xmath5 ) and radiation power ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "remarkably , the only different feature in these experiments@xcite is the use of ultraclean samples with mobility @xmath7 and lower temperatures , @xmath8 . yet , for the previous , @xmath9 , experiments @xcite the mobility is lower , ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath5 higher , ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "much more recently experimental results on this off - resonance giant resistance spike have been presented by the same authors@xcite .",
    "this time they add an in - plane magnetic field to the standard experimental set - up .",
    "remarkably , they obtain that the radiation - induced resistance oscillations and spike present different response to an increasing in - plane magnetic field .",
    "resistance oscillations are shifted to higher perpendicular magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) , when the in - plane is increased .",
    "yet , the spike approximately keeps the same position .",
    "then , the authors suggest that both effect are ruled by different physical mechanisms .",
    "other strong resistance spikes in radiation - induced @xmath1 oscillations experiments were previously obtained around the cyclotron resonance @xmath12@xcite for higher frequencies and power and being explained by resonant heating of electrons .",
    "off - resonance phenomena are always remarkable phenomena in all branches of physics .",
    "they are counterintuitive with respect to the basic resonance process , meaning a challenge to the available theory .",
    "then , it would be important to fully understand these phenomena , not only from the basic standpoint but also from the application side .",
    "for instance , they could lead to the design and development of novel _ ultrasensitive _ photon detectors@xcite in the microwave and terahertz bands , where the technology is not well - developed yet .",
    "= 3.9 in = 3.3 in = 3.9 in = 2.0 in    in this article , we theoretically study this radiation - induced @xmath1 spike applying the theory developed by the authors , _ the radiation - driven electron orbits model_@xcite . according to it ,",
    "when a hall bar is illuminated , the electron orbit centers perform a classical trajectory consisting in a harmonic displacement along the direction of the current at the @xmath3 frequency .",
    "this motion is damped by the interaction of electrons with the lattice ions and with the consequent emission of acoustic phonons .",
    "thus , the 2des moves periodically at the radiation frequency altering dramatically the scattering conditions and giving rise eventually to @xmath1 oscillations and zrs .",
    "we extend this model to a ultraclean sample , obtaining that all the scattering conditions are modified . mainly because the ll , which in principle are broadened by scattering , become very narrow in this kind of samples .",
    "this implies an increasing number of states at the center of the ll sharing a similar energy . in between ll",
    ", it happens the opposite , the density of states decreases dramatically ( see upper panel of fig.1 ) .",
    "therefore , the elastic scattering rate , due to charged impurities , increases , meanwhile the inelastic one ( phonon emission damping ) decreases .",
    "thus , the elastic scattering time ( inverse of elastic scattering rate ) decreases reaching a limiting value of half of the time of a standard sample .",
    "this specific value is related with the ll degeneracy . for the irradiated electrons ,",
    "half of the scattering time is physically equivalent as being driven by radiation of frequency @xmath13 .",
    "accordingly , the cyclotron resonance is shifted to a new @xmath0-position around @xmath2 . on the other hand , the inelastic scattering decreases and the emission of acoustic phonons is less efficient producing a _ bottleneck effect _ which prevents from releasing the absorbed energy to the lattice .",
    "finally the corresponding amplitude abruptly increases giving rise to a strong resistance spike .",
    "we also present a microscopical theoretical approach to the dependence of the ll width on the magnetic field for the regime of ultraclean samples .",
    "we apply this approach in the framework of the general theory of the radiation - driven electronic orbits model .",
    "we find that this dependence is very important to explain the experimental shift found in the resistance oscillations with respect to the magnetic field for this kind of samples@xcite .",
    "we study also very recent results on the influence of an in - plane magnetic field on the spike and the corresponding connection with the resistance oscillations .",
    "we consider that the main effect of adding this parallel magnetic field is to increase the disorder perceived by the electrons in the sample .",
    "within our model and among the different sources of scattering , inelastic scattering of electrons by interaction with acoustic phonons ( emission ) is the most directly affected .",
    "the basic result is a progressive damping of the spike and the whole radiation resistance response .",
    "this is observed in experiments@xcite .",
    "the total scattering rate reflects also this increasing disorder which broadens the ll ; now the ll width depends on both the perpendicular and in - plane magnetic fields . as feedback effect , this will eventually affect the charged impurity scattering rate .",
    "this feedback and the ll degeneracy cut - off value explain the different behavior of the spike and resistance oscillations with the in - plane magnetic field .",
    "initially , all spike - related phenomena were tried to be explained@xcite as unique events with an origin different from radiation - induced @xmath1 oscillations . yet , in this article we consider that the resistance spike and everything related with it , are the outcome of an extreme scenario of the radiation - induced oscillations in ultraclean samples and therefore , sharing the same physics .",
    "the _ radiation - driven electron orbits model _ , was developed to explain the @xmath1 response of an irradiated 2deg at low magnetic field .",
    "we first obtain an exact expression of the electronic wave function .",
    "then , the total hamiltonian @xmath14 can be written as@xcite : @xmath15 @xmath16 is the center of the orbit for the electron spiral motion : @xmath17 @xmath18 the intensity for the mw field and @xmath19 is the dc electric field in the @xmath20 direction . @xmath21 is the hamiltonian corresponding to a forced harmonic oscillator whose orbit is centered at @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath21 can be solved exactly @xcite , and using this result allows an exact solution for the electronic wave function@xcite :    @xmath22 \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty } j_{m}\\left[\\frac{ee_{0}}{\\hbar } \\left(\\frac{1}{w}+\\frac{w}{\\sqrt{(w_{c}^{2}-w^{2})^{2}+\\gamma^{4}}}\\right)\\right ] e^{imwt}\\ ] ]    and the main result that we want to point out is that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the solution for the schrdinger equation of the unforced quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "@xmath25 are bessel functions and @xmath26 is a classical lagrangian of an electron in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "= 3.8 in = 3.45 in = 3.8 in = 2.5 in    @xmath27 is the classical solution of a forced and damped harmonic oscillator : @xmath28 where @xmath18 is the mw electric field .",
    "@xmath29 is a damping factor for the electronic interaction with the lattice ions giving rise to emission of acoustic phonons .",
    "= 3.7 in = 3.4 in    then , the obtained wave function is the same as the one of the standard quantum harmonic oscillator where the center is displaced by @xmath27 .",
    "this implies that the electron orbit centers oscillate harmonically at @xmath3 .",
    "this @xmath30 behavior will affect dramatically the charged impurity scattering and eventually the conductivity .",
    "next , we calculate the scattering suffered by the electrons due to charged impurities ( elastic ) applying time dependent first order perturbation theory .",
    "thus , we calculate the scattering rate@xcite between two @xmath31 landau states ( ls ) , the initial , @xmath32 , and the final , @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the scattering potential for charged impurities@xcite , @xmath36 @xmath37 being the surface of the sample , @xmath38 the gaas dielectric constant , and @xmath39 is the thomas - fermi screening constant@xcite . after some algebra we arrive at an intermediate expression for the charged impurities scattering rate : @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath41 is the ll width and the last part of the expression represents the density of final landau states , @xmath42 , in the elastic scattering jump , @xmath43 + @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the corresponding ll energies for the initial and final states respectively .",
    "once we know the scattering rate , we consider that when an electron undergoes a scattering process jumping from the initial state to the final one , it advances an average effective distance@xcite , @xmath46 , given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the effective distance advanced when there is no radiation field present .",
    "then , following ridley@xcite we can obtain the expression for the longitudinal conductivity @xmath49 according to the expression , @xmath50 being @xmath51 the energy .",
    "then , we get to the final expression which reads ,    @xmath52^{2 } \\left[1 + 2e^{\\frac{-\\pi\\gamma}{\\hbar w_{c}}}+e^{\\frac{-\\pi\\gamma } { \\hbar w_{c}}}\\frac{x_{s}}{\\sinh x_{s}}\\left(\\cos\\frac{2\\pi e_{f}}{\\hbar w_{c}}\\right)\\right]\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 is the impurities density and @xmath54 . to obtain @xmath1 we use the relation @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , we reach an expression for @xmath1 : @xmath58    the radiation power , @xmath6 , can be related with @xmath59 through the well - known formula that gives radiation intensity @xmath60 ( power divided by surface ) in terms of the radiation electric field @xmath18 : @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath63 is the permittivity in vacuum . if we want to express only the power in terms of the radiation electric field we have to take into account the sample surface .",
    "in the particular case of gaas we can readily obtain : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the speed of light in gaas and @xmath38 is the gaas dielectric constant .",
    "accordingly , @xmath66 then , substituting in the expression of @xmath59 , we obtain that @xmath1 varies with @xmath6 following an square root law : @xmath67 thus , we expect that the @xmath1 response will grow according to the square root of @xmath6 , i.e. , following a sublinear dependence which is finally reflected in the amplitude , @xmath68 .      the precise shape of broadened ll in real systems ( with disorder ) remains , even currently , controversial .",
    "usual assumptions are gaussian@xcite , lorentzian@xcite and semielliptic@xcite , being the two first , the most commonly used . for instance , some published experimental results@xcite indicate that they could be equally described or explained assuming either a lorentzian or gaussian profiles .",
    "more recently , other works related with radiation - induced @xmath1 oscillations and zrs , have used lorentzian shapes for ll in the corresponding theoretical models@xcite in our case , dealing with ultraclean samples ( very narrow ll ) , and low @xmath0 and @xmath5 , there is no much theoretical or experimental information about the real profile of the broadened landau states .",
    "we have to consider that the samples used in the experiments@xcite with extremely high mobilities have been very recently obtained .",
    "then , we are facing a completely brand new scenario requiring more theoretical and experimental work .",
    "therefore , as a first approach and following t. ihn@xcite , we have assumed for the broadened density of landau states a lorentzian function being the width independent of the ll index .",
    "if we rewrite eq .",
    "( 8) considering that @xmath69 , @xmath70 now , this last expression can be further developed if we apply the poison sum rules@xcite ,    @xmath71    and then , we can reach for @xmath42 , @xmath72 exp\\left[-\\frac{\\pi\\gamma s}{\\hbar w_{c}}\\right ] \\bigg\\}\\ ] ] that with @xmath73 we finally obtain , @xmath74 \\bigg\\}\\ ] ]    normally in this calculations if the exponent is not very small it is enough to consider the first term @xmath75 . yet , since we are dealing with high mobility samples and very small @xmath41 the latter approximation can not be applied",
    ". then if the total sum is carried out we obtain@xcite : @xmath76 = \\frac{exp\\left[-\\frac{\\pi\\gamma}{\\hbar w_{c}}\\right]}{1-exp\\left[-\\frac{\\pi\\gamma}{\\hbar w_{c}}\\right]}\\ ] ] that translated into the final density of states ,    @xmath77}{1-exp\\left[-\\frac{\\pi\\gamma}{\\hbar w_{c}}\\right ] } \\bigg\\ } \\\\ = \\frac{m^{*}}{\\pi \\hbar^{2}}\\bigg\\{\\frac{1+exp\\left[-\\frac{\\pi\\gamma}{\\hbar w_{c}}\\right]}{1-exp\\left[-\\frac{\\pi\\gamma}{\\hbar w_{c}}\\right ] } \\bigg\\}\\ ] ]    substituting this result in eq .",
    "( 7 ) , we arrive at the final expression for the charged impurities scattering rate which reads : @xmath78}{1-exp\\left[\\frac{-\\pi\\gamma}{\\hbar w_{c}}\\right]}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath79@xcite represents the charged impurities scattering rate for a @xmath80 mobility sample which is recovered for wide @xmath41 , @xmath81    as we said above , for ultraclean samples @xmath41 is very small and for experimental magnetic fields@xcite , it turns out that @xmath82 . then",
    ", if @xmath0 increases , the exponent @xmath83 decreases making @xmath84 continuously to increase .",
    "however , there exists a cut - off defined by the ll degeneracy : @xmath85 in a regime of narrow ll the density of states @xmath42 can be approximated considering that in an elastic scattering , such as the one caused by charged impurities , most processes take place at the center of the ll , sharing approximately the same energy ( see fig.1 upper panel ) and then @xmath86 .",
    "this implies that , @xmath87 in this regime of narrow @xmath41 , in an interval energy of @xmath88 we must have , in average , a number of states given by the ll degeneracy and therefore :    @xmath89     + this is only fulfilled if , @xmath90 which is a remarkable result because translated into the expression of eq .",
    "( 22 ) we obtain :    @xmath91\\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow w_{m , n}\\simeq 2 \\times w_{0}\\ ] ]    then , the charged impurities scattering rate increases with @xmath0 till a cut - off value of twice the corresponding of a standard sample . in terms of charged impurities scattering time , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the time of a standard sample and @xmath94 corresponds to a ultraclean one . accordingly , the ultraclean scattering time , @xmath95 turns out to be twice shorter than the standard and then , the scattering event is twice faster .    within the framework of our theory@xcite , this implies that during the time @xmath94 and compared to the standard for the same @xmath0 , the ultraclean 2des appears to be displaced by radiation a smaller distance .",
    "in other words , in terms of scattering , the _ ultraclean _ harmonic motion ( electron orbit center displacement ) is perceived as delayed regarding the _ standard _ , as if electrons were driven by radiation of smaller frequency ( see fig",
    ". 1 lower panel ) , more precisely , of half frequency .",
    "then , the radiation electric field , @xmath96 , is perceived as , @xmath97 by the ultraclean 2des .",
    "the conclusion is that in ultraclean samples , during scattering , electrons @xmath98 radiation with half of the real frequency . applying next the theory@xcite",
    ", we reach an expression for @xmath1 in the ultraclean case : @xmath99 according to it , now the resonance in @xmath1 will take place at @xmath100 , as experimentally obtained@xcite .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath1 spike will depend on the relative value of the frequency term , ( @xmath101 ) , and the damping parameter @xmath29 in the denominator of the latter @xmath1 expression .",
    "when @xmath29 leads the denominator the spike is smeared out . yet , in situations where @xmath29 is smaller than the frequency term , the resonance effect will be more visible and the spike will show up . as we explained above , the parameter @xmath29 represents the interaction of electrons with the lattice ions , damping the electronic orbits motion and releasing radiation energy in form of acoustic phonons .",

    "( 27 ) we can consider average values for the cyclotron energy and for the acoustic phonon energy in the case of experimental parameters .",
    "thus , for the magnetic fields swept in the experiments we can take in average that the cyclotron energy is @xmath112 mev , and the phonon acoustic energy is , @xmath113 mev .",
    "then , for those values the cosine term , @xmath114\\sim-1\\ ] ] that gives an expression for the damping parameter which reads    @xmath115    according to this last expression , for increasing @xmath0 the term inside brackets decreases and as a result , the parameter @xmath29 will get smaller , making increasingly difficult the damping by acoustic phonon emission and the release of the absorbed energy to the lattice . therefore , we have a _ bottleneck effect _ for the emission of acoustic phonons .",
    "now it is possible to reach a situation where @xmath116 making visible a resonance effect and , therefore , giving rise to a strong resonance peak at @xmath100 . for gaas and standard experimental parameters@xcite",
    ", we obtain that @xmath117 and that in a ultra - clean regime@xcite it decreases till @xmath118 .",
    "this fixes a lower cut - off value for the radiation frequency where the resistance spike could be observed .",
    "according to our calculations this would be around @xmath119 .",
    "experiments have also pointed out that at lower frequencies is much more difficult to observe resistance spikes .",
    "one important issue which plays a key role in the model presented above is the dependence of @xmath41 on the magnetic field . previous experimental and theoretical works@xcite report that for lower @xmath0 ( but higher than @xmath120 t ) , @xmath41 varies with the magnetic field as @xmath121 . yet , for increasing @xmath0 , @xmath41 becomes independent . for our brand new scenario of extremely high mobility samples at very low @xmath0 , ( @xmath122 t ) , and",
    "very low temperature , ( @xmath123 k ) , there is no much information , experimental or theoretical , about the actual dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , and as a first approach , we have developed a simple microscopical description , based in scattering parameters , of this dependence which starts from previous analytical expressions@xcite .",
    "thus , following t. ihn@xcite , we begin with the expression which relates @xmath41 and @xmath0 , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the zero magnetic field quantum scattering lifetime . for the experimental spikes@xcite ,",
    "the magnetic field used is very low , around @xmath126 .",
    "then , for this regime we can assume that the variation of @xmath41 with @xmath0 is closer to a straight line than to a square root and proceed to linearize the latter expression .",
    "thus , we expand the square root by a taylor series around @xmath127 t , till the first derivative term . then , we can write , @xmath128 and finally obtain the expression which gives the dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath0 for very low @xmath0 @xmath129 where @xmath130 .",
    "p is a phenomenologically introduced parameter which takes into account that the dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath0 does not follow strictly a straight line but it is close to it . in our case",
    "we have assigned @xmath131 .",
    "this expression implies that , for extremely high mobility samples and very low @xmath0 , the landau states broaden almost linearly with the magnetic field affecting all scattering processes such as elastic impurity scattering and inelastic phonon scattering .",
    "this dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath0 has been used throughout the above theoretical model on spikes .",
    "= 3.9 in      the effect of an in - plane magnetic field , ( @xmath132 ) , on the radiation - induced resistance oscillations was already studied and published@xcite , and experimental results showed that the main effect was a progressive damping of the whole resistance response as @xmath132 increased .",
    "subsequent theoretical results@xcite , confirmed and explained the surprising damping in the framework of the radiation - driven electrons orbits model .",
    "accordingly and as we said above , in an irradiated 2des in the presence of a perpendicular @xmath0 , electronic orbits are forced to move back and forth , oscillating harmonically at the frequency of radiation and with an amplitude proportional to the radiation electric field . in their radiation - driven motion ,",
    "electrons interact with the lattice ions being damped and producing acoustic phonons .",
    "the presence of @xmath132 imposes an extra harmonically oscillating motion in the @xmath133-direction enlarging the electrons trajectory in their orbits .",
    "this would increase the interactions with the lattice making the damping process more intense and reducing the amplitude of the orbits oscillations .",
    "therefore , the effect of the presence of @xmath132 is to increase the disorder in the sample from the electrons perspective .",
    "the hamiltonian for electrons confined in a 2d system ( x - y plane ) by a potential @xmath134 and subjected to a total magnetic field @xmath135 , ( @xmath136 ) is given considering the previous hamiltonian of eq .",

    "we obtain the wave functions of two harmonic oscillators , one in the @xmath20 direction and the other in the @xmath133-direction : @xmath145 \\phi(z)\\ ] ]    in a semiclassical approach the electron is subjected simultaneously to two independent harmonic motions with a trajectory depicted in fig . 9 : as we have indicated above , the presence of in - plane @xmath0 alters the electron trajectory in its orbit increasing the frequency and the number of oscillations in the @xmath133-direction .",
    "now the frequency of the @xmath133-oscillating motion is @xmath146 .",
    "this makes longer the electron trajectory increasing the total orbit length and eventually the damping .",
    "this increase in the orbit length is proportionally equivalent to the increase in the number of oscillations in the @xmath133-direction .",
    "thus , we introduce the ratio of frequencies after and before connecting @xmath142 as a correction factor for the damping factor @xmath29 .",
    "the final damping parameter @xmath147 is :    @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the effective length of the electron wave function when we consider a parabolic potential for the @xmath133-confinement@xcite , @xmath150 + the expression of @xmath147 shows that one of the main results of the presence of @xmath142 is an increase in the damping parameter due to the interaction with lattice ions .",
    "therefore , the whole resistance response to radiation , ( spike and oscillations ) will be increasingly damped . the second important effect is reflected in the total quantum scattering rate @xmath151 . according to the matthiessen rule",
    "the total scattering rate can be expressed as the sum of the different individual scattering sources , @xmath152 and obviously one of them is the acoustic phonon scattering rate .",
    "the increase in the phonon scattering rate ( @xmath153 ) due to @xmath142 will eventually affect the total scattering rate that will increase as well , making it @xmath142-dependent , @xmath154 .",

    "increasing temperature for the same sample , ( @xmath162 ) the spike vanishes but the radiation - induced oscillations still remain but with lower intensity , as expected .",

    "9a ) . in fig .",
    "9b , we add a parabolic potential in the @xmath133 direction and we introduce @xmath132 , then the electron trajectory is circular in the plane and at the same time is oscillating in @xmath133 . in fig .",

    "10 we present calculated irradiated @xmath1 versus @xmath0 for a radiation frequency of @xmath202 ghz and for different values of the in - plane magnetic field @xmath142 .",
    "@xmath142 goes from @xmath190 t till @xmath203 t in intervals of @xmath204 t. we first observe a progressive damping of the @xmath1 spike and oscillations .",
    "for approximately @xmath205 t the spike has been completely removed .",
    "we observe as well that for @xmath206 , the main @xmath1 peak associated with the spike , shifts to higher @xmath0 .",
    "as we have previously explained , the main effect of @xmath142 is an increase of disorder in the sample . in our approach",
    "this is reflected in a stronger interaction of electrons with the lattices ions giving rise to a more intense emission of acoustic phonons .",
    "then , the absorbed radiation energy can be more efficiently released and the resistance response tends to progressively collapse .",
    "this is similar to the effect of an increasing lattice temperature as previously presented ( see fig .",
    "remarkably we observe that from @xmath207 t till @xmath208 t , the @xmath1 spike remains approximately in its position , ( see green arrows in fig .",

    "we observe that meanwhile the spike does not move when we sweep @xmath142 from @xmath207 t till @xmath208 t , the corresponding resistance oscillations present a clear shift to higher @xmath0",
    ". one could think in principle that such different @xmath142 responses could indicate different physical origin .",
    "however following our theory , they are totally connected .",
    "and the explanation has to do , as before , with the variation of @xmath41 with the magnetic field .",
    "the explanation can be obtained from fig.12 .    in fig .",
    "12 we present the @xmath188 term versus @xmath0 for same values of @xmath142 as in fig .",
    "10 , and adding @xmath209 t. in principle , the interpretation is similar to fig .",
    "now the presence of an increasing @xmath142 , gives rise to larger @xmath41 which as a result makes @xmath188 to decrease .",
    "then , the impurity scattering time decreases continuously being reflected in the perceived radiation frequency which decreases too .",
    "the final outcome is that @xmath1 oscillations shift to higher @xmath0 as @xmath142 increases .",
    "the effect is similar as having increasingly dirtier samples .",
    "this is a general behavior for all values of @xmath142 .",
    "the only difference is that for increasing @xmath142 , @xmath188 grows slower versus @xmath0 .",
    "yet , we can see in the figure that from @xmath207 t till @xmath208 the threshold of @xmath210 is achieved in the sweeping @xmath0 before the resonance condition of @xmath211 or around it .",
    "then , when reaching this condition , the resonance effect can take place and an intense @xmath1 spike will rise in the same position for all of them , as experimentally obtained@xcite .",
    "therefore , we obtain some @xmath142 values , ( @xmath212 ) where constant spike position coexist with a shift of @xmath1 oscillations to larger @xmath0 . for the @xmath142 values that reach @xmath210 after the resonance condition ,",
    "the spike apparently would rise at higher @xmath0 but the intense damping effect done by @xmath142 makes it to vanish and can not be observed any longer .",
    "however , the shift of @xmath1 oscillations still can be observed and an example is the shift of the main @xmath1 peak associated with the spike .",
    "in summary , we have theoretically studied the recently discovered intense radiation - induced magnetoresistance peak obtained in ultraclean 2des .",
    "the most remarkable feature of such a peak is that it shows up at @xmath2 and with an amplitude of an order of magnitude larger than the standard radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations .",
    "we apply the radiation - driven electron orbits model and we calculate the charge impurity elastic scattering rate , which increases in ultraclean samples , to obtain the novel resonance peak position ( far off resonance ) .",
    "we obtain the inelastic scattering rate by phonon damping , which decreases in ultraclean samples , showing that it is responsible of the large peak amplitude .",
    "we present a microscopical model to explain the dependence of the ll width ( @xmath41 ) on the magnetic field for ultraclean samples . we find that this @xmath0-dependent variation of @xmath41 is essential to explain the experimental shift found in the resistance oscillations .",
    "accordingly , the shift and the resistance spike are physically connected .",
    "we have studied also very recent results on the influence of an in - plane magnetic field on the spike . according to them radiation - driven resistance oscillations and",
    "spike offer different behavior when this magnetic field is increased , as if they had different physical origin .",
    "the same model allows us to explain such surprising results .",
    "we conclude that the role of the in - plane magnetic field is mainly to increase the disorder making the ultraclean sample to behave progressively as a dirtier sample and affecting the total scattering rate and the width of the ll .",
    "now , the simultaneous dependence of this width on @xmath0 and @xmath142 explains the apparent contradiction .",
    "another important physical effect observed in experiments@xcite for the first time in ultraclean samples is an important decrease in the measured resistance for very low magnetic fields .",
    "this effect is obtained without radiation and is described in the experiments as a pronounced negative magnetoresistance . yet , as the magnetic field increases , the usual values of standard magnetoresistance are recovered .",
    "this effect , closely related with the quality of the sample , is the main topic of a future work .",
    "calculated results are in good agreement with experiments .",
    "these results are remarkable also from a technological standpoint .",
    "for instance in nanophotonics where they could lead to the design and development of _ ultrasensitive _ photon detectors in the microwave and terahertz bands where the technology is not mature yet .",
