    "the recent advances in fabrication technologies have promoted the microring resonator devices to the status of preferred platform for many photonic signal processing functionalities , such as optical filtering , dispersion compensation , sensing , or group delay control @xcite .",
    "although microring structures can be realized using different materials , most proposals of passive structures have focused on silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) devices to date , due to obvious reasons of convenience and the available enabling technology .    in designing photonic structures at the top - level ,",
    "a waveguide coupler is most conveniently treated as an ideal , lumped component characterized by the numerical value of its coupling constant . however , in the standard fabrication process , the coupling constant is determined mainly by the transversal offset , i.e. by the separation between the coupler waveguides . to meet the accuracy typically demanded for the value of the coupling constant , such separation must be set with a precision of around a few nanometers , which is near the current technological limit .    to overcome the difficulty described above , an alternative approach was proposed in @xcite .",
    "this technique consists in varying the coupling length rather than the inter - guide separation , which remains constant .",
    "such variation is in turn obtained by changing the longitudinal offset between the two parallel coupled straight waveguides of fixed length .",
    "photolitographic production is then feasible with this technique as the resolution requirements are strongly relaxed .",
    "as it stands , the longitudinal offset technique unavoidably imposes a certain type of phase imbalance between the fields at the two outputs of any coupling section .",
    "thus , relative phase - shifts appear and accumulate throughout the whole structure . in this work ,",
    "we study the control of the relative group delay that can be attained and its use in various photonic devices . a proof of principle of the operation of these designs is obtained by the simulation of their performance using a finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) solver for 2d maxwell equations .",
    "applications of the proposed devices in optical beamforming networks and quantum information systems are discussed .",
    "the geometry of a crow implementing the longitudinal offset technique is shown in figure [ fig::crow ] . with reference to figure [ fig::celda ] , @xmath0 is the length of the straight waveguide sections and corresponds to the coupler length for zero lateral displacement , @xmath1 , is the length of each curved waveguide section of radius @xmath2 .",
    "the half ring length is @xmath3 and will be assumed constant .",
    "the longitudinal offset @xmath4 is defined in the figure and will be regarded as positive whenever the displacement is along the direction of the propagation of the field in that section and negative otherwise .",
    "we can trace the effect of the coupling and the propagation phase in figure [ fig::celda ] to write the field relations @xmath5    rewriting the above expressions as @xmath6permits to obtain the one - cell matrix relation @xmath7and the input - output maxtrix relation for the whole chain @xmath8 \\left (   \\begin{matrix } e_{n+1}^{+ } \\\\   e_{n+1}^{-}% \\end{matrix}% \\right ) .",
    "\\label{evolucion}\\ ] ]    if the input signal is placed at @xmath9 , taking into account that @xmath10 , we can obtain @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the top diagonal element in the matrix relation .",
    "expression evidences that , for the specific case of a crow chain and within the scope of the ideal model ( wavelength - independent coupling constants ) , the offset - induced phase imbalance is harmless as far as the amplitude response is concerned , which was misinterpreted in @xcite , while a contribution to the group delay that is the cummulative effect of the longitudinal offsets appears in the system response .",
    "this effect can be engineered to yield added functionalities to the structure , as described below .",
    "the geometry depicted in figure [ fig::esquema ] shows that there are two sets of input / output ports available , which are respectively marked as @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "when the transmission path is changed from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , there is a sign flip for every value of @xmath4 along the signal path . according to equation ,",
    "this implies a net change in the group delay when the transmission topology is changed .",
    "therefore , there exist two possible transfer functions implemented by the same physical system that are identical except for a global group delay term that can take two opposite values @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ fig::esquema ] displays the schematic of a @xmath16 ring crow .",
    "the transmission path for the _ fast _ @xmath13 input - output ports is marked with dashed arrows and the _ slow _ path relating the @xmath14 input - output ports is marked with solid arrows .",
    "the transfer functions are @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a common term that would correspond to the transfer function of the same system implemented without the longitudinal offsets .                    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]         it should be noted that each input port ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) coincides with the reflection path for the converse configuration .",
    "when both transmission paths are simultaneously used , this circumstance will generally call for taking additional measures at the design stage , depending on the specific application .",
    "however , even if the reflected signals can not in general be ignored , in this specific type of crow filter the reflected spectral components correspond mainly to the band - stop transmission of the filter @xcite , the reflection level thus being negligible when the transmitted signal is predominantly localized in the filter pass - band , which avoids the problem .",
    "the reflected signals can also be used to engineer complex architectures , as detailed below .",
    "using a y - branch to combine both inputs , as shown in figure [ fig::dossalidas ] , we can simultaneously obtain two outputs with the same amplitude spectral shaping and a relative delay .",
    "the shape used for the representation of the signals intends to reflect the existing relation in the filtering due to the common term @xmath18 in . cascading",
    "this type of structures would permit to obtain a series of relatively delayed signals generated from the same input with a given filtering .",
    "the filtering in the first stage will substantially mitigate the effect of reflections in subsequent elements . reversing the scheme , as shown in figure [ fig::tdm ] ,",
    "permits to multiplex two signals with a controlled relative time - delay and simultaneously apply the same filtering to both inputs . the relative delay between the two channels",
    "is given by the expression @xmath19 for equal @xmath20 , the above expression reads @xmath21 .",
    "the connection of the two inputs using a 3 db splitter and the outputs with a 3 db coupler , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::mz ] , leads to the implementation of a mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometer and an overall transfer function @xmath22 this type of response can be exploited to double the fsr of an optical filter by adequately tuning of the relative delay .",
    "the position of a spectral null every other transmission band of the crow filter requires the condition @xmath23 or , for constant @xmath20 , with @xmath24 taking into account that @xmath25 , with @xmath26 defined in fig .",
    "[ fig::celda ] , we can write @xmath27 a design based on the above condition is too sensitive to small deviations of the microring parameters in the fabrication process .",
    "a more robust design can be obtained by seeking the desired response only in a limited bandwidth .",
    "if @xmath28 , with @xmath29 a rational number close to @xmath30 , the mz and crow resonance conditions will coincide at a particular band of the crow periodic response and an approximate cancellation will happen in a certain bandwidth that will depend on the value of @xmath29 .",
    "fabrication tolerances in this case will affect the actual response of the filter , but a good approximation to the original design can be obtained in the presence of small deviations from the ideal design parameters . in this case , the value of a constant offset for a given coupler length is given by the expression @xmath31    by adding a phase control to one the output branches , the mz configuration can be used to produce and process quantum superpositions of time - bin states for quantum information applications @xcite . instead of a design based on equation , as in the previous fsr doubling application ,",
    "the offsets are calculated such that produces the required time - bin separation which has to be larger than the pulse width .",
    "this proposal permits an integrated optics implementation with a precise control of the photon waveform through the filter spectral shaping and is better suited to relative delays in the picosecond range @xcite .",
    "we now consider a longitudinal offset group delay shifter ( logds ) built by cascading various systems of the type described in fig .",
    "[ fig::dossalidas ] .",
    "if the transmission bandwidth is small compared to the fsr , multiple delayed outputs of the signal present in a single wavelength channel will be produced at the output , whereas most of the spectral content present in the optical input will be reflected .",
    "this can be used for the realization of complex wdm architectures for generating multiple delayed signals at different channels , as illustrated in figure [ fig::adddrop ] , which could find application , for instance , in advanced optical beamforming networks @xcite .",
    "the frequency selectivity is strictly required only in the first stage of the logds tree that can be implemented with a high @xmath32 single ring stage . after the extraction of the drop channel , the rest of the wdm multiplex is reinjected in the optical transmission line using a circulator . using this procedure",
    ", @xmath33 delayed replicae of the signal at each wdm channel are produced at each respective output .",
    "the systems depicted in figures [ fig::dossalidas ] , [ fig::tdm ] and [ fig::mz ] , for @xmath16 ring crows have been analyzed using the fdtd method @xcite . in each case",
    ", independent simulations have been performed for the subsystems bounded by the dashed - dotted lines in the figures , and the computed transfer functions have been used to obtain the total response .",
    "the computations have been performed on an equivalent 2d reduced model obtained using the effective index method .",
    "all the waveguides in our devices are @xmath34 wide and an effective index of @xmath35 has been assumed .",
    "the bent waveguide sections have an inner radious of @xmath36 in all cases .",
    "the evanescent couplers have been implemented with a waveguide separation of @xmath37 .",
    "the geometry used for the @xmath38 db y - branch couplers and splitters is depicted in fig .",

    "the variation of the coupling coefficient with the wavelength is apparent in the results .",
