    "the global network of gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors@xcite has yet to discover a signal , but their null detections have already constrained astrophysical models .",
    "magnetar flares provide an example of such constraints .",
    "satellite detectors observe unpredictable bursts of soft gamma - rays from neutron stars with extreme magnetic fields , known as magnetars .",
    "the hypothesis that a gw arrives within @xmath0s of such a gamma - ray burst was tested by looking for transient excess power in the gw data within this signal region , and comparing to the background@xcite .",
    "there was no gw detection .",
    "the loudest transient event in the signal region was then compared to simulated gw signals predicted by models of the damping of non - radial global stellar modes , allowing the null detections to constrain these models .",
    "so long as the signal region duration @xmath1 is much less than the characteristic detector uptime timescale @xmath2 , model exclusion from individual null detections can proceed as described above .",
    "however , when @xmath3 the situation is more complicated . in this case",
    ", the detectors may have outages during the signal region , and the data will have gaps",
    ". a short burst of signal falling a gap will be missed .",
    "electromagnetically - triggered searches for gws from core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) are an example . a typical core collapse time estimated from optical light curves",
    "has a large uncertainty , and gw signal regions typically have durations lasting days or weeks .",
    "for example , sn2007gr was a promising supernova about 9mpc away .",
    "it was discovered on august 15 , 2007 , and the a pre - discovery empty image from august 10 constrains the core - collapse time to an approximately five day region . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical gw detector uptime timescale is only hours . because @xmath3 , using a null detection from gw data to exclude sn models with a single ccsn event will be complicated by gaps in the data , and exclusion statements must be made with lowered confidence to reflect these observational gaps",
    "this motivates the use of multiple ccsn events to improve the confidence of exclusion statements .    in this paper",
    "we describe a simple and general method for quantifying the confidence of null - detection model exclusion statements given non - stationary detectors ( or detector networks ) and multiple observational events .",
    "we illustrate the method with a hypothetical search for gws from ccsne .",
    "we begin by reviewing the frequentist loudest event limit construction , consistent with procedures described in@xcite and used in astrophysical gw searches for burst - like signals such as@xcite .",
    "any physical observable which can be expressed as a monotonic function of the signal amplitude may be constrained ; we refer to it as the observable of interest . in the case of gw searches ,",
    "the observable of interest is typically either root - sum - square gw strain at the detector ( @xmath4 ) , gw emission energy @xmath5 , or source distance ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the signal is convoluted with the detector s response function and noises and may produce an `` analysis event . '' in general an analysis event is anything interesting in the analyzed data , and could be a time- and frequency - limited burst of excess power , for example@xcite .",
    "an analysis event in the signal region might correspond to either noise or a transient gw signal that is not strong enough to claim a detection .",
    "the analysis must define a ranking statistic with which to calculate the ` loudness ' of analysis events .",
    "the general procedure for constructing an upper or lower limit is as follows :    1 .   using the ranking statistic , estimate the loudness of the analysis events in the signal region .",
    "2 .   for a class of signals predicted by the model of interest , add a simulated signal at a particular amplitude at a randomly selected time into the data .",
    "analyze the data .",
    "if the chosen amplitude is large enough , the simulated signal will produce an analysis event with some measurable loudness .",
    "[ item : inject ] 3 .   assign an analysis event to the simulated signal . to do this ,",
    "find analysis events within a time @xmath7 of the simulated signal s known placement , estimate their loudnesses , rank them , and choose the loudest .",
    "@xmath7 is chosen to be as small as possible while not missing a significant fraction of loud , easily detectable signals@xcite .",
    "the loudness of the analysis event corresponding to the recovered simulated signal will depend on local noise fluctuations , in addition to the amplitude of the simulated signal .",

    "repeat ( [ item : inject ] ) and ( [ item : detect ] ) for a range of signal amplitudes ( which can be mapped to the physical observable of interest @xmath8 ) and at each value determine the fraction @xmath9 of added simulated signals with associated analysis events louder than the loudest signal region analysis event .",

    "this results in the 90% confidence limit for the model @xmath10 and the observational event , the red construction in figure[fig : effcurve ] .",

    "a network of multiple detectors independently turning on and off can be thought of as a single non - stationary detector comprised of the individual instruments .",

    "a signal may have occurred while no detector was observing , so we can not use this event to absolutely exclude the model .",
    "this case can be analyzed in the same way as the simpler single detector , 100% duty cycle case introduced above : add simulated signals randomly into the entire signal region and construct the efficiency curve .",
    "the procedure requires no modification .",
    "simulated signals which fall into regions where no detector is observing will , of course , not be detected , and will not be counted in the detected fraction of the efficiency curve .",

    ", width=434 ]    we assume a flat probability density function for the location of the observational event ( for example , a ccsn ) within this signal region .",
    "we can make an exclusion statement for a model @xmath10 , which predicts a signal from the event with some specific value @xmath11 for the observable of interest ( which could correspond to the ccsn gw strain , for example ) following the procedure in section[sec : loudesteventlimits ] , except in this case the efficiency curve will asymptote to the overal duty cycle @xmath16 .",
    "we could make a statement such as,``we exclude the model @xmath10 with 80% exclusion confidence '' if @xmath11 were greater than three , for example . with a single event this is the best we can do . for any value of @xmath11 predicted by the model",

    "the probability of missing detectable signals from both events is 1/4 , and we can exclude the model @xmath10 with up to 75% exclusion confidence . in general , for @xmath17 independent observational events with duty cycles @xmath18 ( the fraction of the signal region observed by the detector for the @xmath19th event ) , the maximum exclusion confidence is _",

    "the individual efficiency curves are constructed for each ccsn in figure[fig : reachapproach ] . for illustrative purposes",
    "we have added some randomized uncertainty in each simulated signal s @xmath4 to model detector noise , which is why the efficiency curves are not perfect step functions .",
    "the detector can detect gw signals out to a distance of 3 units , although in some cases noise fluctuations will subtract from the signal while in others they will add to the signal . given the noise level used here",

    "then the energy predicted by the model @xmath10 , @xmath33 , is drawn as a vertical line on the curve and the total model exclusion confidence @xmath26 is read off from the y - axis .",
