    "the failure of `` simple '' photoionization models to describe the narrow emission line spectrum of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) was shown dramatically by filippenko & halpern ( 1984 ) , who found that the line widths of the optical forbidden lines were correlated with the critical density and ionization potential of those lines .",
    "this correlation indicates stratification of the photoionized region , with the lines emitting near their critical densities .",
    "recent hubble space telescope images of seyfert 2 galaxies show that these objects are rich with ionization cones ( evans et al .",
    "1991 ; tsvetanov & walsh 1992 ; wilson et al .  1993 ; macchetto et al .",
    "1994 ; and arribas et al .",
    "1996 ) , knots ( acosta - pulid et  al . 1996 ) , and filaments , and strands ( falcke et  al . 1996 ) of ionized gas .",
    "we should not expect that these complex environments can be described with simple , single - component photoionization models .",
    "similar images of seyfert 1 type objects show a less complex , symmetric structure that may indicate a viewing angle preference consistent with the unification model of seyfert galaxies ( schmitt & kinney 1996 ) .",
    "two - component photoionization models have been proposed by binette , wilson , & storchi - bergmann ( 1996 ) and have met with some success in describing the emission line spectrum of seyfert galaxies .",
    "this model assumes that the narrow line region ( nlr ) is composed of both matter - bounded and ionization - bounded clouds , and that the covering fraction of the two populations can account for the range of observed line emission .",
    "a multi - component photoionization model has been proposed by komossa & schulz ( 1997 ) , who assume that the nlr is effectively composed of a few clouds with a range of gas densities and distances from the central agn .",
    "both of these types of models do much better at reproducing the scatter in the line ratio observations than single component photoionization models .",
    "an alternative to photoionization by the central source is photoionization by fast moving shocks .",
    "dopita & sutherland ( 1995 ) describe in detail these `` photoionizing '' shocks and argue that all narrow emission lines can be excited by these processes .",
    "however , morse , raymond , & wilson ( 1996 ) and wilson ( 1997 ) discuss the viability of such shocks in describing the emission spectrum of active galaxies .",
    "in particular , wilson ( 1997 ) argues that the energetics of radiative shocks may not account for the observed line luminosities .",
    "it is still unclear exactly what role shocks play in the nlr environment ; that is , whether they provide the bulk of the energy input for the observed emission or merely compress gas so that it emits more strongly when photoionized by a central source ( pogge 1997 ) .    we will assume that photoionization by the central source is the dominating mechanism responsible for nlr emission .",
    "we extend the locally optimally - emitting clouds ( loc ) hypothesis of baldwin et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) to nlr gas .",
    "this assumes that in nature , gas with a wide range of physical conditions is present and the emission line spectrum we observe is predominately a result of a simple , yet powerful , selection effect : we observe lines from clouds best able to emit them . to this end",
    "we present the results of a large grid of photoionization models and make predictions of the nature of the integrated spectrum .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that the source of narrow line emission observed in active galaxies is from photoionized clouds that are similar to illuminated molecular clouds in our own galaxy .",
    "the source of these clouds may be four - fold : ( 1 ) molecular cloud complexes in the disk of the galaxy ; ( 2 ) the dusty molecular torus that is believed to surround the central source and which will certainly be photoionized ; ( 3 ) ism entrained behind a radio jet so that photoionization by the central source becomes important ; and ( 4 ) material `` snow plowed '' in the form of bow shocks in front of a radio jet such that it too may be photoionized by the central source .",
    "we will ignore emission that may be due to shock excitation coming from photo - ionizing shocks , although how important this emission is to the overall spectrum is unclear ( wilson 1997 ) .",
    "we have used the spectral synthesis code cloudy ( version 90.03 ; ferland 1996 ) to calculate the emission from plane parallel , constant hydrogen density clouds ionized by a continuum similar to that expected from a typical seyfert galaxy with @xmath0  ergs  s@xmath1 .",
    "the shape of the ionizing continuum was chosen to be a combination of a uv - bump of the form @xmath2 and an x - ray power law of the form @xmath3 spanning 13.6  ev to 100  kev .",
    "the uv - bump cutoff temperature , @xmath4 , was chosen such that the uv - bump peaked ( in @xmath5 ) at 48  ev .",
    "the uv and x - ray components were combined with a typical seyfert uv to x - ray spectral slope , @xmath6 .",
    "the ionization / thermal equilibrium and radiative transfer calculations for a single cloud proceeded until one of the following three conditions were met .",
    "first , the electron temperature dropped below 3000  k. gas with lower temperatures does not contribute significantly to the emission lines presented in this paper .",
    "second , we do not allow clouds to have thicknesses in excess of 10% of its distance from the central continuum source .",
    "third , we do not allow the total hydrogen column density to exceed 10@xmath7 @xmath8 ; this mainly affects the very high ionization clouds and prevents them from becoming thomson thick . in practice",
    "the third condition had little impact on the narrow emission lines .",
    "the largest cloud of the grid presented below is one with a thickness of @xmath916  pc , consistent with the size of large molecular clouds .",
    "we will comment further on the effects of these stopping criteria in a later section .    finally , we assume that each cloud sees the full continuum with no obscuration . at large enough distances , intervening clouds or diffuse",
    "ism may attenuate the ionizing spectrum significantly .",
    "we have looked at the effects of such ism attenuation on the incident continuum : an ism with gas densities as low as 0.1  @xmath10 such as found in the local ism of the milky way ( wood & linsky 1997 ) would have no effect on the results presented below .",
    "a higher density ism ( n(h ) = 0.5  @xmath10 ) however , would have an effect at large distances from the ionizing source , due to the larger column density and lower ionization resulting in a higher gas opacity .",
    "for the higher density gas and the shape and luminosity of the incident continuum given above , the attenuated continuum has an optical depth of unity at 4  ryd at a distance of @xmath11  cm from the ionizing source , resulting in 5  20% changes in the line luminosities . at larger distances",
    "the attenuation by a dense ism would result in a decrease in the luminosity of the emitted spectrum of up to a factor of 10 .",
    "we neglect this complication for simplicity .",
    "we have computed , on the university of kentucky convex exemplar parallel supercomputer , a grid of 1,881 of the single cloud models described above in a plane of hydrogen gas density and distance from the central ionizing source .",
    "we chose a range of parameters in order to cover all the possible physical conditions of narrow line region gas .",
    "the hydrogen gas density , @xmath12 , ranged from 10@xmath13 ",
    "10@xmath14 @xmath10 .",
    "the incident continuum flux was varied so that for an assumed ionizing continuum luminosity @xmath15 ergs s@xmath1 ( monochromatic luminosity @xmath161450   ) = 39.558 ergs s@xmath1  @xmath1 for the continuum shape used here ) the distance from the ionizing source of radiation , @xmath17 , varied from 10@xmath18 ",
    "10@xmath19  cm .",
    "this distance range scales with the luminosity as @xmath20 .",
    "the conversion from incident flux to luminosity and radius assumes that the ionizing radiation is emitted isotropically .",
    "however , observations of ionizing `` cones '' ( evans et al .  1991 ; tsvetanov & walsh 1992 ; wilson et al .  1993 ; macchetto et al .  1994 ; and arribas et al .",
    "1996 ) and uv - photon deficits ( binette , fosbury , & parker 1993 ; and morse , raymond & wilson 1996 ) imply that the gas may see a different ionizing continuum than we do .",
    "calculations were performed assuming two abundance sets : solar and a set including dust that varied with distance from the ionizing source .",
    "we will describe each set of abundances in turn and compare the two in terms of diagnostic line ratio diagrams in a later section .",
    "figure  1 shows the results of grid calculations , for solar abundance clouds , in the form of contour plots of logarithm equivalent width referred to the incident continuum at 4860   .",
    "the solar abundances are from grevesse & anders ( 1989 ) and grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) and have the following values :    h : 1.00e+00 he:1.00e-01 li:2.04e-09 be:2.63e-11 b : 7.59e-10 c : 3.55e-04 n : 9.33e-05 o : 7.41e-04 f : 3.02e-08 ne:1.17e-04 na:2.06e-06 mg:3.80e-05 al:2.95e-06 si:3.55e-05 p : 3.73e-07 s : 1.62e-05 cl:1.88e-07 ar:3.98e-06",

    "the ionization parameter provides a useful homology relationship with the emission lines ( davidson 1977 ) .",
    "@xmath21 is defined as the ratio of hydrogen ionizing photon density to hydrogen density , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the flux of hydrogen ionizing photons and @xmath24 is the speed of light . for reference a dashed line",
    "is placed on the upper left hand plot of the first panel representing @xmath25 .",
    "the ionization parameter increases from top right to bottom left in these diagrams ; lines of constant @xmath21 have a slope of @xmath26 .",
    "shown in figure  1 are 23 strong optical , uv and infrared recombination , resonance , and forbidden lines .",
    "the temperature of the illuminated face of the cloud is also shown in the upper right hand plot of the first panel .",
    "for many emission lines a ridge of near maximum equivalent width runs diagonally across the distance  gas density plane , roughly parallel to lines of constant ionization parameter .",
    "most lines are emitted optimally for a narrow range of ionization parameter spanning this ridge . for larger ( smaller ) ionization parameters",
    "the gas is over ( under ) ionized , and the line is not efficiently emitted .",
    "this explains the sudden drops in the emission line equivalent widths on either side of their ridges . moving _ along _ the ridge to increasing gas densities , at near constant ionization parameter , the forbidden lines become collisionally deexcited and the line equivalent width falls off . moving along the ridge at constant ionization parameter to smaller gas densities ,",
    "the equivalent widths of some lines also diminish as other lines of similar ionization , but lower critical density , become important coolants .",
    "this effect is especially dramatic for @xmath271549 and @xmath271035 .",
    "the stopping criteria assumed in @xmath282.1 do affect the resulting spectrum .",
    "the grid of models shown in figure  1 includes clouds that are both optically thin and optically thick to hydrogen ionizing radiation .",
    "optically thin clouds generally occupy the lower left portion of the distance  density plane below a line with slope @xmath29 @xmath302/3 and intersecting the lower right hand corner . the temperature of this gas ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ranges from 20,000  k to several million k. emission lines presented in this paper are not emitted by gas with t@xmath31   10@xmath32  k ( x - ray lines _ are _ ) .",
    "these hot clouds are generally truncated by the plane parallel condition discussed earlier .",
    "optically thick clouds are in the upper right portion of the figures , and the gas generally has nebular temperatures , except the extreme upper right corner where the electron temperatures can be as low as a few hundred kelvin and the gas is mostly molecular .",
    "generally the optically thick clouds were stopped because the electron temperature fell below 3000  k ( @xmath282.1 ) .",
    "the total hydrogen column density restriction mentioned in @xmath282.1 applies to a small number of high density optically thick clouds in a triangular region bounded by a distance of 1  pc on the the topside and a line roughly parallel to @xmath33 on the leftside .",
    "the clouds in this region do not significantly contribute to the narrow forbidden line spectrum .",
    "different types of lines can be seen in figure  1 to be emitted from clouds with a range in gas densities and distances .",
    "recombination lines , such as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , generally form broad planes of maximum equivalent width whereas the forbidden lines , such as [ ] , are either narrow ridges or peaked islands ( [ ] @xmath277325 ) .",
    "figure  1b shows the differences in the nebular and auroral lines of [ ] and [ ] .",
    "notice that the auroral features are formed optimally at higher densities , because of their higher critical density .",
    "figure  1c shows the contour plots of a few of the stronger uv - lines .",
    "figure  1d shows a few strong [ ] infrared fine - structure lines from a 16-level model atom .",
    "the model atom has the same configuration as that shown in thompson ( 1995 ) and uses the collision data of pradhan & zhang ( 1993 ) and einstein as from quinet , le dourneuf & zeippen ( 1996 ) .",
    "verner et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) compare the differences between the 16-level model atom and a much larger definitive 371-level calculation .",
    "preliminary comparisons show that predicted line intensities of the 16-level atom differ typically by a few percent and at maximum by 10% from the larger 371-level calculation .    to illustrate the problems encountered when trying to use conventional diagnostic line intensity ratios for an ensemble of clouds with a wide range of physical conditions",
    ", we momentarily assume that each emission line in the total spectrum is produced with the maximum possible equivalent width found in the figures .",
    "we then use this spectrum to reproduce the standard density and temperature diagnostic line ratios .",
    "this is the simplest way to document the effects of a distribution of clouds .",
    "three density indicators are given by osterbrock ( 1989 ) .",
    "these include the [ ] @xmath276716/@xmath276731 and [ ] @xmath273729/@xmath273726 doublets and the [ ] @xmath271907/  ] @xmath271909 ratio .",
    "for [ ] , pradhan & zhang ( 1993 ) use the 1.534  @xmath36m/1.644  @xmath36 m ratio as a density indicator .",
    "assuming a temperature of 10,000  k , the [ ] ratio we predict gives an n@xmath31 of 300  @xmath10 , for the predicted [ ] doublet the density is 700  @xmath10 , for the [ ] ratio n@xmath31 is 20,000  @xmath10 , and the [ ] /  ] ratio gives a density of nearly 300,000  @xmath10 .",
    "the [ ] ( @xmath274959  +  @xmath275007)/@xmath274363 temperature  density diagnostic using the peak emission of figure  1 and an electron temperature of 10,000  k gives an electron density on the order of a few million  @xmath10 .",
    "the point of this exercise is clear : _ line diagnostics fail when the gas has a wide range of physical conditions_. as figure  1 shows , many of these lines form at different densities and temperatures .",
    "however , by using the diagnostic line ratios , one assumes that the lines are formed in gas of similar physical conditions , which is obviously not the case in figure  1 , and is likely not the case in nature .",
    "we will in a later section integrate the `` visibility functions '' of figure  1 to calculate an emission spectrum by assuming that the observed spectrum is the result of an ensemble of clouds with differing properties .      in the previous section we have assumed that the narrow line region is a dust free environment .",
    "we now recompute the grid assuming that the clouds are dusty .",
    "grains will not survive in an environment with high photoionizing flux due to the various sublimation processes discussed by laor & draine ( 1993 ) . therefore , after the manner of netzer & laor ( 1993 ) we vary the abundances as a function of distance from the ionizing source , in order to mimic these destruction processes . at small distances from the central source",
    "we assume the abundances are solar , as given in the previous section . at a distance of approximately @xmath37  cm from the central source ( for the ionizing luminosity given above ) , orion type graphite grains ( baldwin et  al .",
    "1991 ) are just at their sublimation temperature ( @xmath91750  k ) at the cloud face . at distances larger than this",
    "we include graphite grains within the calculation of the single cloud and deplete carbon such that its abundance is typical of an region ( see below and baldwin et  al .",
    "orion type silicate grains sublimate at @xmath91400  k , corresponding to a distance of @xmath38  cm . beyond this radius the abundances",
    "are set to values which approximate those found in the orion nebula :    h : 1.00e+00 he:9.50e-02 c : 3.00e-04 n : 7.00e-05 o : 4.00e-04 ne:6.00e-05 na:3.00e-07 mg:3.00e-06",

    "rubin et  al .",
    "1991 , 1992 , and osterbrock , tran & veilleux 1992 ) .",
    "although this discontinuous `` turning on '' of grains is unphysical and our choices of grain composition and gas depletions are specific , it serves as an example to simulate the presence of dust in the narrow line region .",
    "the grain physics used here is described by baldwin et  al .",
    "( 1991 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the same contour plots as figure  1 except that the individual models include the grains as specified above .",
    "the discontinuous grain sublimation distances are easily seen in the figure as sharp discontinuities in the contour plots at @xmath39 and @xmath40  cm .",
    "comparisons of figures  1 and 2 show four major effects of grains : ( 1 ) the depletion of refractory elements ; ( 2 ) the weakening of emission lines due to absorption of the incident continuum by dust at large @xmath21 ; ( 3 ) the photoelectric heating of the gas by grains ; and ( 4 ) in the case of resonance lines such as @xmath35 @xmath271216 and @xmath271549 , line destruction by grains .",
    "higher ionization lines , such as [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] , tend to be emitted less efficiently than in the dust - free models , with the equivalent width falling by as much as a factor of 2 .",
    "the weakening of these lines is caused by the absorption of the incident continuum by the dust .",
    "the lower ionization lines ( [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] etc . ) actually have their peak emission increase , though at lower ionization parameters , due to the photoelectric heating of the gas by the grains .",
    "resonance line destruction is readily apparent in figure  2c .",
    "the heavy depletion of iron is also apparent in figure  2d , wherein the peak equivalent width drops by nearly a factor of ten .",
    "this last point will be discussed more fully in a later section .",
    "the equivalent widths shown in figures  1 and 2 reflect the efficiency with which the clouds reprocess the incident continuum .",
    "it is clear that different lines are formed optimally in different places in the gas density  distance plane .",
    "if the distribution function of clouds in this plane is known , then the total line luminosity emitted by a set of clouds will be given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the emission line flux of a single cloud at radius @xmath43 , gas density @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the cloud distribution function , which is not necessarily analytical .",
    "the remaining question is the spatial distribution of the nlr clouds .",
    "many type 2 seyferts have resolved nlr s , often with complex structures that are associated with linear or double - lobed radio sources ( bower et  al .  1995 ; pogge & de robertis 1995 ; capetti et  al .  1996 ;",
    "cooke et  al .",
    "1997 ) , whereas the structure of the nlr in type 1 seyferts is generally more compact and axisymmetric , at least in projection ( schmitt & kinney 1996 ; nelson et al .",
    "since it is not clear how the emitting gas is distributed , in _ all _ its dimensions , we will assume that the distribution function @xmath45 can be approximated by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the cloud covering fractions with distance and gas density , respectively ( see baldwin et  al .  1995 ) .",
    "for simplicity we assume simple power laws : @xmath49 the power law indices , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , will be the only free parameters of our predicted integrated spectra . in the case where both weighting functions are proportional to the inverse of @xmath44 or @xmath43 , then the line equivalent widths of the clouds are equally weighted ( in log space ) across the gas density  distance plane .    in the integrations computed below we assumed certain integration limits in the gas density ",
    "distance plane in order to exclude gas that may not be present in the nlr .",
    "we exclude gas with densities @xmath52 , the rough maximum critical density of the optical forbidden lines observed . by including gas with @xmath53 ,",
    "the line ratios do not change significantly except for those integrations that are weighted to higher densities ( flatter @xmath48 ) .",
    "if present , the contribution of high density gas in the inner regions of the nlr can not be significant or else the narrow line spectrum would appear vastly different ( forbidden lines would be too weak relative to the hydrogen lines ) .",
    "we exclude gas that is closer than 0.1  pc to the ionizing source .",
    "this distance corresponds to the grain sublimation point described in @xmath282.3 .",
    "integration limits were also included in ionization parameter space in order to exclude gas that is far over ( under ) ionized and does not contribute to the observed emission .",
    "these limits effectively exclude gas from the broad emission line region and very high density gas hundreds of parsecs away from the central engine .",
    "integrations described above have been computed and plotted after the manner of baldwin , phillips & terlevich ( 1981 ; hereafter bpt ) .",
