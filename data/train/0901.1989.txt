    "the propagation of quantum strings in time - dependent and singular backgrounds , necessary to understand the nature of cosmological space - time singularities in quantum gravity , is not well understood yet .",
    "string propagation in plane gravitational waves has been studied extensively ( see @xcite among other publications ) because these space - times exhibit some highly special properties : the structure of the riemann tensor implies that all higher curvature invariants vanish , and therefore these backgrounds have no @xmath0 corrections in perturbative string theories @xcite .",
    "the existence of a lightlike covariantly constant killing vector ensures there is no string or particle creation and permits an analytic treatment of the string @xmath1 model for exact plane waves ( the light - cone hamiltonian is quadratic and analytically solvable ) .",
    "we will investigate the transition of a free string across a ( one parameter ) class of resolved gravitational plane waves that develop a singularity at the origin of time when the resolution parameter @xmath2 is taken to zero .",
    "we shall concentrate on exact plane waves whose singular limit ( @xmath3 ) is given by the following scale - invariant profile : @xmath4 this class of backgrounds arises as a penrose limit of a broad class @xcite of space - time singularities .",
    "positive values of @xmath5 correspond to friedmann - like big bang singularities , and negative values of @xmath5 correspond to an infinite - expansion rather than an infinite - contraction singularity ( `` big rip '' ) .",
    "consistency conditions for the space - time background in which a perturbative string theory is formulated take the form of supergravity equations of motion together with an infinite tower of @xmath0-corrections . for non - singular plane waves ,",
    "all the @xmath0-corrections vanish automatically . for singular space - times",
    ", the question of background consistency conditions _ at _ the singular point is subtle .",
    "one approach - plane see @xcite .",
    "background consistency conditions do not enter the considerations within this framework .",
    "] , advocated in @xcite , to formulating string theory in the background ( [ genppwave ] ) is to resolve the singular plane wave profile into a non - singular function , perform the necessary computations and see if the result has a meaningful singular limit .",
    "therefore we want to construct a resolved function @xmath6 to replace @xmath7 in ( [ genppwave ] ) in such a way that @xmath8 everywhere away from @xmath9 .",
    "we remove some of the ambiguity associated with such resolutions by demanding that the original scaling symmetry of the background ( [ genppwave ] ) is recovered when the resolution is removed .",
    "this will happen if the resolved profile @xmath6 does not depend on any dimensionful parameters other than the resolution parameter @xmath2 . in this case , on dimensional grounds , @xmath10 the limit ( [ limt ] ) will be recovered , if , for large values of @xmath11 , @xmath12    the structure of the paper is as follows : first we review the hamiltonian formulation of free string dynamics in the background ( [ genppwave ] ) . then we recapitulate the main results of @xcite for the evolution of the center - of - mass motion across this plane wave singularity .",
    "we extend this analysis to the evolution of excited string modes .",
    "we conclude by discussing stringent conditions arising if one demands the total mass of the string to remain finite after it crosses the singularity . a more detailed discussion of this work can be found in @xcite .",
    "string worldsheet fermions are free in plane wave backgrounds and we shall therefore concentrate on the bosonic part of the string action . we choose light - cone gauge @xmath13 and gauge - fix the metric such that the coupling to the dilaton disappears ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we rescale and rename @xmath14 , set @xmath15 , and fourier transform the @xmath16 coordinates : @xmath17 we obtain a set of harmonic oscillator hamiltonians , @xmath18    the hamiltonian ( [ setham ] ) is quadratic and the related schrdinger wave function @xmath19 can be found using wkb techniques , which are exact for quadratic hamiltonians . up to normalization , a basis of solutions , labelled by the initial condition @xmath20 , can be written as @xcite @xmath21\\right),\\label{basisofsols}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 ( suppressing the index @xmath23 ) is a solution to the `` classical equation of motion '' for the time - dependent harmonic oscillator hamiltonian ( [ hoham ] ) : @xmath24 with specified initial conditions @xmath25 a useful representation is given by @xmath26}\\left(f(t_1 ) h(t_2 ) - f(t_2 ) h(t_1)\\right),\\label{repcfh}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are two independent solutions to the differential equation under consideration , and the wronskian is given by @xmath29=f\\dot{h}-h\\dot{f}$ ] . to derive the singular limit of the wavefunction ( [ basisofsols ] ) it is sufficient to study the singular limit of ( [ ceomc]-[initc ] ) .",
    "for the @xmath30 mode , we obtain as the `` classical equation of motion '' @xmath31 from ( [ initc ] ) it follows that we need to study the @xmath3 limit of the solution that obeys the initial conditions @xmath32 the singular limit has been rigorously considered in @xcite .",
    "essentially , a scale transformation @xmath33 and @xmath34 permits to remove all @xmath2-dependence from equation ( [ ceomzm ] ) leading to : @xmath35 in the singular limit , finiteness for @xmath36 evolving from @xmath37 to @xmath38 translates into finiteness for @xmath39 evolving from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .    for the specific asymptotics ( [ asrefprof ] ) of our resolved profile ( [ scaleinvres ] ) , it can be shown @xcite that , in the infinite past and infinite future , the solutions approach a linear combination of two powers ( denoted below @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with @xmath42 being a function of @xmath5 ) .",
    "the condition for the existence of the singular limit can be deduced by considering two bases of solutions for ( [ ceomzm ] ) , one asymptotically approaching the two powers ( dominant and subdominant ) at @xmath44 ( i.e. for all @xmath45 when @xmath3 ) , @xmath46 and another one behaving similarly at @xmath47 ( i.e. for all @xmath48 when @xmath3 ) @xmath49 with @xmath50 . the two bases are related by a @xmath51 matrix @xmath52 : @xmath53    the condition for the existence of a singular limit can be now deduced @xcite . a heuristic version of the argument goes as follows : we consider a solution @xmath54 with initial conditions given at @xmath40 , that evolves towards @xmath41 , and decompose it with respect to the basis \\{@xmath55,@xmath56 } as @xmath57 .",
    "at @xmath58 we can use the asymptotic expansion ( [ y- ] ) and for generic initial conditions ( including ( [ initcondx ] ) ) at @xmath58 both terms should be of the same order , such that @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we use the relation ( [ q ] ) to write @xmath61 in terms of the basis with asymptotics ( [ y+ ] ) . combining the powers of @xmath2",
    "we obtain @xmath62 since @xmath63 , this expression can only have an @xmath64 limit if @xmath65 .",
    "generically , this will lead to a discrete spectrum for @xmath5 , the normalization of the overall plane wave profile ( [ scaleinvres ] ) .",
    "the evolution of excited string modes is described by time - dependent harmonic oscillator equations @xmath66 it again suffices to analyze the singular limit of @xmath67 defined by ( [ ceomc]-[initc ] ) . because @xmath68 is finite , it is natural to expect that it does not affect the existence of the singular limit , governed by the singularity emerging from @xmath69 .",
    "this is indeed the case for positive @xmath5 , or @xmath70 . for negative @xmath5 unstable motion of",
    "the inverted harmonic oscillator leads to divergences and the analysis becomes more subtle .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "to derive @xmath67 for equation ( [ de ] ) we use the following strategy : the differential equation ( [ de ] ) is linear and at any @xmath71 the solution @xmath36 can be written in terms of a `` transfer matrix '' @xmath72 that only depends on the initial and final times , @xmath73 the transfer matrix is completely determined once @xmath67 has been determined , and vice versa .",
    "we now divide the solution region into three sub - intervals , indicated in the following figure :    ( 140,20 ) ( 0,10)(1,0)140 ( 30,15 ) ( 69,15 ) ( 100,15 ) ( 15,9 ) ( 55,9 ) ( 85,9 ) ( 125,9 ) ( 15,4 ) ( 53,4 ) ( 85,4 ) ( 125,4 ) ( 70,9 ) ( 70,4 )    the boundaries of the near - singular region ii depend on @xmath74 which is chosen to approach @xmath75 in the singular limit as @xmath76 with @xmath77 staying finite in relation to the `` moments of observation '' @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and @xmath80 a number between 0 and 1 . for each interval",
    "we now introduce a local transfer matrix @xmath81 for the evolution from the initial time of the interval to the final time of the interval . on each interval",
    ", we can write the transfer matrix @xmath81 in terms of a local @xmath82 . using matrix multiplication to construct the full transfer matrix @xmath72 in terms of the @xmath81 , we can deduce an expression for the @xmath67 of the complete interval , in terms of the local @xmath82 of the three sub - intervals : @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 we differentiate each @xmath82 with respect to its first and second argument ( evaluated at the initial and final time of the local interval ) .",
    "we study the existence of the singular limit of @xmath67 as follows : for two linear differential equations related by a small perturbation we can establish a bound on the difference between perturbed and unperturbed solutions with the same initial conditions , using gronwall s inequality ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this bound , of course , applies to each local @xmath82 .",
    "for each of the three sub - intervals introduced above , we consider a simplified differential equation that is a good approximation to equation ( [ de ] ) on the corresponding interval :    * region i and iii : @xmath86 ( related to bessel s equation ) ; * region ii : @xmath87 ( equation of motion for the zero mode ) .",
    "then , on each sub - interval , @xmath82 can be written as the sum of a simplified @xmath88 satisfying the simplified differential equation on this sub - interval , plus a small perturbation @xmath89 .",
    "if the exponent @xmath80 that appears in ( [ teps ] ) is appropriately chosen , then , in the singular limit , the @xmath89 will drop out of the expression for the total @xmath67 because they are accompanied by positive powers of @xmath2 . then , demanding that the @xmath3 limit of the complete @xmath67 should exist , yields exactly the same condition as the one for the existence of a singular limit of the center - of - mass motion : @xmath65 .",
    "we assume this condition is fulfilled and we obtain in the singular limit : @xmath90    from wronskian conservation and @xmath65 we can write @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( where @xmath93 can be determined from the center - of - mass motion ) . we use ( [ repcfh ] ) to determine the matching conditions for a basis of solutions @xcite , @xmath94",
    "although , for @xmath95 , consistent propagation of the string center - of - mass across the singularity guarantees that all excited string modes also propagate in a consistent fashion , small excitations of higher string modes can sum up to yield an infinite total energy @xcite for the whole string . to determine the mode creation we calculate the bogoliubov coefficients for the string modes related to the transition of the string through the singularity . from ( [ basissol ] )",
    "we construct on the one hand a basis of positive and negative frequency modes at early times and on the other hand a basis of positive and negative frequency modes at late times . in light - cone gauge",
    "the worldsheet theory inherits the scale invariance of the metric and the bogoliubov coefficients ( that relate the two bases ) are independent of @xmath23 : @xmath96 here , @xmath97 .",
    "the total mass of the string after crossing the singularity is given by @xcite @xmath98 since the @xmath99 are @xmath23-independent , @xmath100 can only be finite if @xmath101 for all @xmath23 . for @xmath102 ,",
    "this can not be achieved , since @xmath103 and @xmath93 is real .",
    "let us first mention that to satisfy background consistency conditions we have chosen to add a dilaton field . the dilaton field in the backgrounds of the type ( [ genppwave ] ) takes the form @xcite",
    "@xmath104    for the plane waves that arise as penrose limits of friedmann - like cosmologies ( positive @xmath5 ) , it turns out that individual excited string modes propagate consistently across the singularity , whenever the center - of - mass of the string does . in those cases ,",
    "the dilaton ( [ dltn ] ) is actually very large and _ negative _ near the singularity , and one can expect that free strings are a good approximation as far as propagation across the singularity is concerned ( the string coupling is small in the near - singular region ) .",
    "however , for free strings , we find it impossible to maintain a finite total string energy after the singularity crossing , provided that the ( scale - invariant ) singularity is resolved in a way that does not introduce new dimensionful parameters .",
    "the only way out appears to be to allow hidden scales buried at the singular locus ( even though the space - time away from the singularity is scale - invariant ) .",
    "if @xmath5 is negative , ( [ dltn ] ) blows up near @xmath105 ( and so does the string coupling ) posing a serious threat to the validity of perturbative string theory , and of free string propagation as zeroth order approximation thereto .",
    "our considerations can be seen as a motivation to study these backgrounds in the context of non - perturbative matrix theory descriptions of quantum gravity @xcite .",
