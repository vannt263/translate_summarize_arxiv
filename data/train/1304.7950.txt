    "severe geomagnetic storms are among the most dangerous space weather disturbances caused by solar activity .",
    "impressive examples are the superstorm on 12 september 1859 produced by the carrington event @xcite , when ` many fires were set up by arching from induced currents in telegraph wires ' ( e.  loomis in ) , and the 1314 march 1989 superstorm , when a system - wide power blackout occurred in quebec ( canada ) .",
    "strongest geomagnetic storms develop due to the arrival of magnetic clouds ( mc ) , which originate from solar coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) . in a presumable typical scenario , an mc forms from an erupting magnetic flux rope , which stretches out into interplanetary space , while its ends usually remain connected to the sun . if an earth - directed mc has a magnetic field component pointing south ( @xmath0 ) , then magnetic reconnection between such an mc with the earth s magnetosphere results in a geomagnetic disturbance .",
    "the effect is considered to directly depend on the magnetic field strength and the mc velocity .",
    "thus , eruptions involving regions of strongest magnetic fields with the favorable orientation , _ i.e. _ , sunspot penumbras and especially umbras , are major candidates as sources of superstorms ( _ cf . _ ) .",
    "such events produce fast cmes , powerful flare emissions up to gamma rays , strong radio bursts at microwaves , millimeters and even submillimeters , and energetic particles . indeed , nine of the 11 superstorms with dst @xmath1 nt during solar cycle 23 listed by were due to major solar eruptive events ( goes x - class flares ) , but those on 7 april 2000 and 20 november 2003 , the latter being the strongest one during solar cycle 23 ( dst = @xmath2 nt according to the final data of the kyoto dst index service , http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dst_final/index.html ) , were not .",
    "these facts imply that either an amplification mechanism exists or scenarios of such events might be different from a typical one .",
    "the 20 november 2003 superstorm was probably due to a solar eruptive event on 18 november .",
    "this event occurred during the second appearance on the earth - facing solar hemisphere of a decaying complex of formerly superactive regions ( ars ) 10484 ( 10501 ) , 10486 ( 10508 ) , and 10488 ( 10507 ) ( the first numbers correspond to the previous solar rotation ar numbers .",
    "we will use hereafter the last three digits of the noaa numbers for brevity ) responsible for the extreme events late in october 2003 ( see , _ e.g. _ , ; ; @xcite @xcite ; ) .",
    "several studies ( _ e.g. _ , ; ; ; ; ; ) revealed various features of the 18 november event but have not led to a certain conclusion about the causes of its extreme geomagnetic effect .",
    "the overall scenario of the event remains unclear .",
    "the major question is why this moderate eruptive event produced an mc with a very strong magnetic field near earth of @xmath3 nt , extremely large southern component @xmath4 nt , and eventually caused the superstorm .",
    "the success of a recent attempt by seems to be questionable because the conjecture about two merged mcs is not supported quantitatively , while the corresponding large outline in their figure  16 disagrees with three reconstructions of the mc @xcite as all show a compact cross section .",
    "this mysterious event urges one either to find a key to its extremity or to confess that a possible superstorm can commence unexpectedly .",
    "the only way we see in pursuing the former option is to analyze the 1820 november complex event including eruptions , cmes , and the interplanetary disturbance in still more detail .",
    "the event has turned out to be the most complex one among all those we ever dealt with .",
    "its complexity and unusual properties were misleading for some previous studies .",
    "their conclusions are compared with the observational facts presented here .",
    "we untangle the complex scenario of the whole event by following its manifestations and exclude one by one phenomena whose association with the superstorm is unlikely , as well as the corresponding conjectures considered previously . on the other hand ,",
    "our results obtained in this way shed additional light on scenarios of eruptions , their course , relations between eruptions and flares , excitation of shock waves , and other important issues .",
    "we present our study in four companion papers .",
    "the present paper ( hereafter paper  i ) analyzes eruptions from region 501 on 18 november 2003 and their subsequent evolution .",
    "paper  ii ( grechnev _ et al . _ , 2013 , in preparation ) addresses cmes , coronal shock waves , and drifting radio bursts , which this event produced .",
    "paper  iii ( uralov _ et al .",
    "_ , 2013 , in preparation ) addresses the interaction between the erupting filament and the magnetic field in the neighborhood of a coronal null point and the helicity mismatch between the mc and the pre - eruption region .",
    "proceeding from the results of paper i  iii , paper  iv ( grechnev _ et al .",
    "_ , 2013 , in preparation ) tries to understand the possible causes of the extremity of the 20 november geomagnetic storm .",
    "solar eruptions are closely associated with flares and cmes .",
    "understanding these phenomena is important for both the fundamental science and space weather forecasting . despite many years of studying eruptive phenomena neither persuasive scenarios of eruptions and cme initiation nor their quantitative characteristics have been established .",
    "relations between flares , cmes , and accompanying disturbances remain under debate .",
    "some observational challenges do not meet adequate theoretical expectations .",
    "all of these circumstances urge one to analyze eruptions and associated phenomena in detail , especially quantitatively .",
    "eruptive prominences / filaments and surges have been traditionally observed from earth in the h@xmath5 line and more recently in the he  i 10830   line .",
    "these observations , limited by the loss of opacity , rarely allow measurements up to long distances .",
    "space - borne observations in extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) coronal emission lines of fe  ix 171    and fe  x  xi 195  carried out by the _ extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope _ ( eit ) aboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) , the _ transition region and coronal explorer _ ( trace ) , and recently by the _ extreme ultraviolet imager _ on the _ solar terrestrial relation observatory _ ( stereo ) and the _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ ( aia ) on the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo ) show filaments in absorption and sometimes in emission as they are heated .",
    "the he  ii 304    line is well suited to detect filaments due to its temperature sensitivity range ( maximum at 80000  k ) .",
    "observations in this line were limited up to the recent time .",
    "a typical eruptive filament ( prominence ) rises , expands , and departs from the sun as a core of a cme .",
    "filament material can partly drain back to the solar surface along stretched field lines , former legs of the filament .",
    "sometimes the eruptive filament stops after the initial rise or returns back to the sun ( ` failed eruptions ' ) .",
    "the magnetic structure of an eruptive filament mainly persists , although partial reconnections seem to occur both in the filament and between it and the magnetic field in the environment .",
    "observations also suggest that occasionally an eruptive filament can transform into a large cloud , which falls back down to the solar surface far from the eruption region ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests dramatic changes in the magnetic structure of the filament .",
    "such little - known anomalous eruptions have been rarely observed in the 304    line .",
    "most models of eruptions and cme initiation involve magnetic flux ropes with or without passive filaments embedded and many models invoke magnetic reconnection .",
    "however , the possible role of filaments themselves in eruptions from active regions is not highlighted by most models .",
    "this might be partially due to insufficient observational basis of the models because of the limitations mentioned above and difficulties to observe the initial phases of cmes , as well .",
    "the 18 november event manifested in a series of partial eruptions followed by the eruption of a large filament rooted in ar  501 ( @xmath6n00  e18 ) , a complex long - duration h@xmath5 flare , and soft x - ray ( sxr ) bursts with two reported peaks at 07:52 and 08:31 ( _ all times hereafter are ut _ ) .",

    "( lasco ; ) on soho observed two cmes starting at 08:06 and 08:49 .",
    "several papers addressed various aspects of this solar event , its preparation , and consequences .",

    ", , , , and compared properties of the eruptive filament with those of the magnetic cloud which hit earth .",
    "the eruptions in this event were observed by several instruments , but not analyzed in most of the previous papers . started to study the eruptions , but their analysis was incomplete , and the discussions were mainly based on assumptions , although the observations allow one to carry out detailed measurements .",
    "our interest in the 18 november 2003 event is reinforced by the observation of a large inverse - y - shaped dark feature moving after the eruption across the solar disk in the south - west direction towards the limb @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was recorded in 304    by the _ spectroheliographic x - ray imaging telescope _",
    "( spirit ; and ) aboard the _ complex orbital near - earth observations of activity of the sun _",
    "( coronas - f ) satellite . concluded that the darkening was due to absorption of the solar emission by a cold plasma cloud formed from an eruptive filament and stated that the filament ` probably failed to become a cme core ' .",
    "this circumstance has not drawn the attention of researchers who studied the geoeffective outcome of the event . from the absorption observed in the he  ii 304    line , we estimate a density and mass of the absorbing cloud and compare it with the mass of the eruptive filament .",

    "the horizontal velocity of the major part of the cloud at that time was between 110 and 60  km  s@xmath8 ( figure  [ f - eruption3_plots]a , b ) .",
    "analysis of absorption mechanisms in the he  ii 304    line @xcite shows that a darkening in this line can be due to two processes : _ i _ )",
    "non - resonant absorption of incident continuum emission in hydrogen and helium , and _ ii _ )  resonant scattering of the he  ii emission irradiated by the whole solar hemisphere on the he  ii ions in the cloud .",
    "the latter mechanism alone provides a depression of @xmath75 . with a line - of - sight velocity of the cloud @xmath76  km  s@xmath8",
    ", the doppler shift of the he  ii 304  line in the cloud from the emission line diminishes the resonant scattering .",
    "the absence of the cloud in any of the h@xmath5 channels indicates its rather high vertical velocity .",
    "thus , the darkening in the he  ii 304    line was mainly due to the non - resonant absorption .",
    "the average depressed brightness within the darkening of 0.84 corresponds to the optical thickness of @xmath77 .",
    "assuming the non - resonant absorption mechanism , with an average absorption cross section of @xmath78  @xmath79 for the @xmath80 mixture @xcite , we obtain the total column number of atoms @xmath81  cm@xmath45 . with a thickness of the absorbing layer of the order of 10  mm",
    ", this corresponds to a reasonable gas density of @xmath83  @xmath84 .",
    "integration over the total area of the absorbing feature gives a cloud mass of @xmath85  g from the 304  data .",
    "though no darkening was visible in the spirit 175    coronal images , their processing revealed absorption with an average optical thickness of @xmath86 .",
    "the mass of the cloud estimated from the 175    data is @xmath87  g with a middle value of @xmath88  g , which agrees with the @xmath89 within the accuracy of the estimation .",
    "these estimates refer to the total mass of the cloud including the surrounding euv filament channel , because euv radiation is absorbed with nearly the same cross section by plasmas with temperatures of up to @xmath90  k.    in summary , the average mass of the y - like cloud absorbing euv emission , @xmath91  g , was close to the mass of the pre - eruptive filament visible in the h@xmath5 line .",
    "minor fractions of the initial mass could be carried away by the ejecta which erupted at 07:41 and by fastest filament fragments ( possible absorbing material above the limb or behind it was not visible in the image used in the measurements ) .",
    "heated material invisible in euv can contribute to the total mass .",
    "thus , cool material of the y - like cloud inherited the major part of material of the main filament .",
    "variations of the photospheric magnetic fields suggest that eruption e1 at 07:29 as well as eruption e2 at 07:41 might have been triggered by photospheric motions .",
    "the e1 event was presumedly associated with a partial eruption from the easternmost region of filament f1 and the launch of cme1 in the southeastern direction . the eruption manifested in short hxr and microwave bursts and an sxr enhancement with an m1.2 level ( which was not reported ) .",
    "episode e2 started with rapid brightenings of long segments in the south - south - east part of the filament visible in trace and sxi images ( similar brightenings of eruptive filaments are often observed ) .",
    "the average propagation speed of the brightening was @xmath40  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "these circumstances suggest heating in the brightened part of the filament from an initial temperature of @xmath92  k up to @xmath39  mk .",
    "heating could be caused by some process ( possibly associated with magnetic reconnection ) in the filament or below it rapidly ignited over a long distance by an mhd disturbance .",
    "a volumetric fraction of the heated part is unknown , skin - heating is probable @xcite .",
    "heating must result in a rapid increase of the plasma pressure , @xmath93 , by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , heating alone could cause the plasma ejection along the magnetic field .",
    "the impulsive eruption e2 started by 07:41:27 , before the peak of the related microwave burst ( figure  [ f - goes_rstn]d ) .",
    "acceleration of the ejecta reached @xmath94  km  s@xmath45 at about 07:43 to reach its final speed of @xmath95  km  s@xmath8 in the plane of the sky .",
    "the microwave burst was also short and co - temporal with the acceleration pulse .",
    "the sxr emission reached the m3.2 level .",
    "the succession of the phenomena suggests that the flare processes were induced by eruption e2 .",
    "observations do not support a suggestion of that ` the energy release at the first stage of the m3.2 flare ( _ i.e. _ , e1 ) triggered the first ejection ( e2 ) ' .",
    "as figure  [ f - goes_rstn]d shows , the major energy release of event e1 that was observed in hxr and microwave bursts ceased well before the onset of eruption e2 .",
    "as mentioned , this eruption was probably triggered by photospheric motions .",
    "eruption e2 disturbed filament f1 , which probably was in a metastable state . its apparent twitch in the h@xmath5 images that started just after e2 suggests perturbations of plasma flows in the filament .",
    "the filament was initially inclined by @xmath96 to the line of sight and started to lift off following the neutral surface .",
    "it moved up and south - west and underwent , at least , two acceleration phases .",
    "the first acceleration pulse peaked at 07:44:30 ( @xmath50  m  s@xmath45 ) , slightly later than the acceleration of e2 , up to a speed of about @xmath97  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "the second acceleration pulse peaked at about 07:57 ( episode e3 ; @xmath98  m  s@xmath45 ) and resulted in a final speed of @xmath50  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "these plane - of - sky velocities agree with the line - of - sight ones implied by the h@xmath5 wings .",
    "the latest observation of filament fragments in the far - blue h@xmath5 wing ( @xmath99   ) at 08:15:20 ( figures [ f - overview]b and [ f - eruption3_images]d ) suggesting upwards velocities of 6496  km  s@xmath8 also agrees with the overall kinematics . a weak microwave response to the significant acceleration during episode e3 was certainly present ( figure  [ f - goes_rstn]d ) .",
    "the close temporal correspondence between the acceleration episodes of the filament and the flare bursts provides further support for the active roles of the filament itself and plasma flows in the filament .    the temporal correspondence between the acceleration of a cme and flare emissions has been found by and @xcite ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "reconnection in a sheared arcade significantly increases the poloidal magnetic field in the developing flux rope that was quantitatively confirmed by . due to the curvature of the flux rope , the toroidal force propelling its expansion increases .",
    "after impulsive acceleration , the poloidal ` mainspring ' relaxes and the toroidal force ceases , while the flux rope continues to expand with an increased speed . this booster mechanism",
    "e.g. _ , ) seems to be commonly present in flare - related eruptions .",
    "this probably occurred in the faint episode e3 , when the filament impulsively accelerated .    the accelerated filament laminated .",
    "its parts showed rather wide acceleration temporal ranges , maximum accelerations , and speeds .",
    "the strongest acceleration of @xmath100  m  s@xmath45 and highest speed ( @xmath101  km  s@xmath8 ) were measured along the north horn of the y - darkening , where acceleration peaked after 08:02 .",
    "the direction of the filament s motion crossed an unavoidable topological obstacle . as mentioned",
    ", a rising eruptive filament is known to successively reproduce in its motion the contours of the same neutral line of @xmath102 changing with height .",
    "the topology of the neutral lines broke in the saddle region of the neutral surface ( figure  [ f - neutral_surface ] ) , and the filament had no chance to retain its former configuration and integrity after passing through this region .",
    "having encountered this obstacle above region rb at about 08:07 ( episode e4a ) , the filament apparently bifurcated into two components f1@xmath28 and f1@xmath29 . both upwards and downwards",
    "motions of these components are indicated by the red and blue h@xmath5 wings .",
    "the collision probably resulted in reconnection between magnetic structures of the filament with environment magnetic fields .",
    "this assumption is supported by the correspondence between the h@xmath5 and sxr flare - like response in the bifurcation region and the hxr peaks e4a and e4b in active region 501 in the interval from 08:07 to 08:13 because the pre - eruptive filament does not seem to be connected to this region . after that the bifurcated filament apparently transformed into two wide diverging jets constituting the y - like cloud carrying predominantly cool filament material to remote sites on the solar surface .",
    "the spirit images show them at 304    up to the south - west of the limb ( 08:2309:55 ) .",
    "the cloud consisted of dispersed fragments of the filament with wide ranges of speeds and directions of motion within a sector of about @xmath103 in the plane of the sky and some vertical scatter .",
    "the transformation of the filament into the y - like cloud is confirmed by the correspondence between their masses , as well as their common kinematics .",
    "neither off - limb extensions of the y - like cloud , nor a corresponding slow cme are detectable .",
    "plasma flows from this cloud away from the sun are not excluded , while probably most of the mass eventually fell back on the solar surface far from the eruption site .    in the outlined scenario",
    ", reconnection increases the poloidal flux of an ascending flux rope and completes its formation pushing the rope into the interplanetary space . in the 18 november event ,",
    "a portion of the poloidal flux possibly escaped with the y - like cloud coming from the filament .",
    "most of its mass was not ejected into the interplanetary space .",
    "the poloidal flux of this structure could partly be lost in magnetic reconnection with coronal magnetic fields and partly carried away as an almost empty structure invisible in white light .",
    "this circumstance might account for the significant excess of the reconnected magnetic flux with respect to the mc found by and attributed by the authors to reconnection between the mc and interplanetary magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , the unusual scenario of the filament eruption revealed by our analysis makes relating the flare reconnection flux with the 20 november mc questionable",
    ".    the probable scenario of sequential eruptions and subsequent transformation of the filament in the 18 november 2003 event looks unusual , but this event was not exceptional in this respect .",
    "a similar anomalous eruption was discussed by .",
    "the transit of an eruptive filament through a coronal magnetic null point ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ) can transform the filament into an eruptive jet .",
    "presented other candidates for anomalous eruptions and showed their probable correlation with the so - called negative radio bursts ( decreases of the total microwave flux below a quasi - stationary level ) without a one - to - one correspondence .",
    "a negative burst could not be observed in the 18 november event , because the anomalous eruption was followed by ongoing flaring .",
    "the authors suggested anomalous eruptions to be favored by complex magnetic configurations and surrounding of the active region by others , and did not expect an anomalous eruption of a quiescent filament beyond an activity complex .",
    "the clearest example of anomalous eruption was observed by sdo / aia on 7 june 2011 between 06:15 and 10:00 when dispersed absorbing fragments of a disintegrating filament were well visible even in the 193  images without subtraction .",
    "the `` destruction '' of the magnetic structure of an eruptive filament in such anomalous eruptions deserves the attention of future studies .",
    "the anomalous character of the main eruption in the 18 november 2003 event brings the attention to cme2 ( figure  [ f - overview]c ) .",
    "its faint , fast outer halo envelope crossing a distorted streamer could be a trace of a shock wave @xcite excited by one of sharp eruptions .",
    "the initiation time of the inner component estimated by suggests its development in the complex e4 event .",
    "the appearance of the inner component corresponds to the pointing of the pre - eruptive filament f1 and its initial non - radial motion .",
    "remarkable is a radial structure of the inner component suggesting its development from an arcade which was initially located above the filament or its trajectory , and then expanded being forced to erupt .",
    "neither cavity nor core were clearly evident , whereas a threadlike core ( former filament ) is typically a brightest cme component .",
    "these features of cme2 are consistent with our conclusion that the bulk of the filament material had not left the sun ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we will consider cme2 in more detail in paper  ii .",
    "a possible extra eruption seems to have occurred between 08:07 and 08:17 close to the disk center .",
    "this eruption is suggested by the central dimming in the images of goes / sxi ( figure  [ f - ha_sxi]i ) , spirit 175  (figure  [ f - spirit]b  c ) , and eit ( figure  [ f - overview]c ) as well as the ` disconnection ' of the bifurcation region from the flare site shown by the h@xmath5 and hxr time profiles between events e4b and e4c in figure  [ f - ha_sxi]g .",
    "similar manifestations of disconnection were considered by and as indications of changes in the magnetic connectivity during solar flares .",
    "the presumable eruption between 08:07 and 08:17 could result in one extra cme , which might not be detected in lasco images .",
    "this issue will be addressed in papers  ii and iii .",
    "we have found out what happened to the main filament mass , but it is not so clear what happened to its magnetic flux .",
    "part of it might be carried away frozen in the y - like inheritor of the bifurcated filament .",
    "some part of the magnetic flux probably reconnected during the interaction with the bifurcation region .",
    "the final outcome is uncertain .",
    "anyway , these circumstances make doubtful a simple scenario , in which the magnetic cloud hitting earth is considered as a stretched flux rope formed from a structure initially associated with the pre - eruption filament f1 .",
    "concluded that in the 18 november event ` the eruptive filament probably failed to become the cme core ' , but this result was not considered by other authors who analyzed the causes of the extreme geoeffective disturbance and its possible solar source .",
    "they will be revisited in paper  iv .",
    "the challenges revealed in preceding studies of the 20 november magnetic cloud and its presumable solar source , extended by our results , are as follows :    1 .   very strong magnetic field in the mc that was close to a record value .",
    "different handedness of the mc and the presumed solar source .",
    "different orientations of the magnetic field in the mc and the presumed solar source ( @xmath104 , ) .",
    "4 .   implication of cme1 looks doubtful , because a similar cme in the stronger 17 november event was not geoeffective .",
    "responsibility of the moderately fast coreless cme2 for the severest geomagnetic storm seems to be unlikely .",
    "items ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) indicate that the commonly assumed association of the mc with the u - shaped filament in ar  501 is questionable . the suggestions of the eruption which presumedly occurred between 08:07 and 08:17 imply the development of an extra cme . if this hypothetical cme expanded exactly earthward from the solar disk center within a very narrow cone , then the thomson - scattered light was meager to be detected by lasco . such atypically weak expansion of the cme must result in very strong magnetic field inside due to magnetic flux conservation .",
    "paper  ii addresses further suggestions of this possible cme .",
    "to complement the picture of the complex 18 november 2003 event established in preceding papers , we have studied a succession of eruptions and the corresponding flare episodes e1 , e2 , e3 , and e4 in the interval 07:29 to 08:30 .",
    "we have measured the kinematic properties of eruptive filaments and found that they underwent impulsive acceleration episodes , which were temporally close to microwave / hxr bursts .",
    "the eruptions rapidly expanded and lost opacity which made difficult their subsequent observation .",
    "nevertheless , it was possible to reveal their further evolution . our results and their implications are as follows .    1 .   _",
    "triggers and mechanisms of eruptions .",
    "_ probable primary triggers of the partial eruptions at 07:29 ( e1 ) and 07:41 ( e2 ) were photospheric motions .",
    "eruption e2 presumably occurred due to rapid heating of a long filament segment probably caused by an mhd disturbance .",
    "the corresponding sharp pressure increase in the filament could induce an ejection of some part of its material along the magnetic field . in turn , the disturbance produced by eruption e2 most likely destabilized filament f1 and triggered its eruption at 07:56 ( e3 ) .",
    "2 .   _ filament eruptions and cme initiation . _",
    "the eruptions presumably initiated the cmes .",
    "development of the eruptions after their triggers by the factors listed above appears to be self - sufficient so that outer drivers do not seem to be required .",
    "this circumstance is important for models of eruptions and initiation of cmes , while eruptive filaments are often considered to be passive structures being pulled upwards by larger - scale magnetic ropes .",
    "_ anomalous eruption . _",
    "the major eruption was anomalous ; after the initial lift - off , the eruptive filament bifurcated and had not left the sun as a whole , while its main mass probably fell back on the solar surface .",
    "this anomaly occurred due to the collision around 08:07 of the eruptive filament with an unavoidable topological discontinuity  a magnetic null point .",
    "being not able to pass through the obstacle keeping integrity , the filament bifurcated .",
    "flare episodes e4a ( 08:09 ) and e4b ( 08:12 ) responded to this process .",
    "the problem of the geomagnetic impact .",
    "_ relation to the 20 november 2003 magnetic cloud is doubtful for the 07:29 eruption presumedly associated with cme1 and the 07:41 eruption , which most likely had not produced any cme at all .",
    "the transformation of the eruptive filament , whose main part had not left the sun , contradicts simple considerations of the magnetic cloud hitting the earth as a stretched magnetic flux - rope formed from a structure initially associated with the pre - eruption filament . on the other hand , a possible additional eruption , which appears to have occurred between 08:07 and 08:17 close to the solar disk center ,",
    "might be implicated in the development of a structure responsible for the geomagnetic superstorm .",
    "further substantiation of this scenario will be presented in papers ii to iv .",
