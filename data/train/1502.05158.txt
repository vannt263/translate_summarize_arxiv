    "in the present paper we propose to study certain types of weak solutions for ordinary differential equations ( ode ) of the form @xmath2 where @xmath1 is an analytic function .",

    "@xcite ) and the related equation for surface waves of moderate amplitude ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , are reducible to an ode of the form upon passing to a moving frame . owing to the fact that every solution of equation may be interpreted as a traveling wave of a suitable underlying partial differential equation ( pde ) we will call the solutions of traveling waves .",
    "the singular nature of equation accounts for the non - uniqueness of certain solutions , which we call _ singular solutions_. these are in general weak solutions , but have stronger regularity than one would expect a priori : the solutions are analytic except for a countable number of points at which the equation is satisfied in the limit .",
    "furthermore , equation admits an order reduction which allows us to see that under certain conditions on @xmath1 , the solutions are actually classical solutions of this reduced equation .",
    "the main result of this paper consists in the exhaustive characterization of singular solutions of from qualitative properties of the function @xmath3 .",
    "we show that equation admits solutions with peaks and cusps , fronts with finite - time decay and solitary solutions with compact support .",
    "furthermore , we find that one can not obtain peaked and compactly supported solutions for the same @xmath1",
    ". in particular , a peaked solution can not have compact support and vice versa .",
    "the characterization of classical solutions of will be covered only very briefly for the convenience of the reader , since our main focus lies in the analysis of singular solutions .",
    "we apply our results to the aforementioned nonlinear partial differential equations , and show how the different types of singular solutions are obtained varying the energy levels of the hamiltonian planar differential system corresponding to .",
    "it lies beyond the scope of this paper to prove in full generality that every weak solution of is also a weak traveling wave solution of an underlying pde . for a discussion of this problem",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite , where it is shown that in the special case of the camassa - holm equation every weak solution of is a weak traveling wave solution of the underlying pde . following similar steps the same result can be shown for the equation of surface waves of moderate amplitude .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ s_prelimdef ] , we give the precise definitions of weak and singular solutions and provide a preliminary result on the non - uniqueness of solutions of . in section [ s_tw ]",
    "we introduce the notion of _ elementary forms _ , classical solutions of defined on a subset of @xmath4 , from which we construct singular solutions .",
    "furthermore , we discuss how the qualitative features of any traveling wave solution can be obtained from the properties of @xmath1 .",

    "we characterize the classical and singular traveling waves of the camassa - holm equation and the equation for surface waves of moderate amplitude in shallow water .",

    "holm equation can have tws of the form @xmath9 such that some of its level sets @xmath10 are cantor sets , cf .",
