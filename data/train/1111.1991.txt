    "we investigate the reachable set of this hand and we introduce a grasping model , i.e. , we investigate the capability of the robot hand of grasping objects and keeping them stable .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed survey on the modelization of the grasping problem and related features , like equilibrium , stability and optimality of a grasping configuration . in @xcite",
    "the kinematics of a manipulating hand is described in a detailed way . in the last ten years , also in view of the recent technical developments , the researchers explored the self - configuring properties of robotic hands in order to get an automatic motion - planning .",
    "thanks to sensors , like cameras @xcite , and tactile sensors @xcite , the context - awareness capabilities of robots where exploited : modern robots are able to explore the geometry of the target object and to self - configure in order to grasp it .",
    "all the models we mentioned so far share the assumption that the physical properties of the robot hand devices are fixed : there is a fixed number of fingers and each finger has a fixed number of phalanxes . in our model , thanks to the extension control , the number of phalanxes is arbitrary : this gives a possibly large and dense reachable set and , at the same time , easily adapts to no - collision tasks because `` hulky '' phalanxes can be retracted .",
    "the self - similar structure of every finger gives access to iterated function systems and fractal geometry theories in order to study reachability and control algorithms .",
    "robotic devices studied in a similar fashion can be found in @xcite .",
    "some of our theoretical tools come from the theory of non - integer bases . for an overview on this topic",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and to the book @xcite .",
    "in particular , expansions in non- integer bases were introduced in @xcite .",
    "for the geometrical aspects of the expansions in complex base namely the arguments that are more related to our problem , we refer to @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and to @xcite .",
    "we now describe in a more detailed way the setting of our paper .",
    "our robot hand is composed by an arbitrary number of fingers , including the opposable thumb .",
    "each finger moves on a plane .",
    "every plane is assumed to be parallel to the others , excepting the thumb and the index finger , that belong to the same plane .",
    "a discrete dynamical system models the position of the extremal junction of every finger .",
    "a _ configuration _ is a sequence of states of the system corresponding to a particular choice for the controls , while the union of all the possible states of the system is named _",
    "reachable set for the finger_. the closure of the reachable set is named _",
    "set_. our model includes two binary control parameters on every phalanx of every finger of the robot hand .",
    "the first control parameter rules the length of the phalanx , that can be either @xmath0 or a fixed value , while the other control rules the angle between the current phalanx and the previous one . such an angle can be either @xmath1 , namely the phalanx is consecutive to the previous , or a fixed angle @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamics of the finger ensures the set of possible configurations to be self - similar .",
    "in particular the sub - configurations can be looked at as scaled miniatures with constant ratio @xmath3 , named _ scaling factor _ , of the whole structure .",
    "we use this property to investigate a class graspable objects : under appropriate assumptions , if an object is graspable , then every properly scaled , rotated and translated copy of this object is also graspable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the model and in section 3 we remark its relation with the theory of non - integer number systems .",
    "self - similarity of the configurations and some reachability results are also shown . in section 4",
    "we discuss a necessary and sufficient condition to avoid self - intersecting configurations in a particular case .",
    "the grasping problem and some grasping configurations are finally discussed in section 5 .",
    "in our model the robot hand is composed by @xmath4 fingers , every finger has an arbitrary number of phalanxes .",
    "we assume junctions and phalanxes of each finger to be thin , so to be respectively approximated with their middle axes and barycentres and we also assume the junctions of every finger to be coplanar . inspired by the human hand , we set the fingers of our robot as follows : the first two fingers are coplanar and they have in common their first junction ( they are our robotic version of the thumb and the index finger of the human hand ) while the remaining @xmath5 fingers belong to parallel planes whose distance is a fixed @xmath6 .",
    "we now describe in more detail the model of a robot finger .",
    "a configuration of a finger is the sequence @xmath7 of its junctions .",
    "the configurations of every finger are ruled by two phalanx - at - phalanx motions : extension and rotation . in particular , the length of @xmath8-th phalanx of the finger is either @xmath0 or @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a fixed ratio : this choice is ruled by the a binary control we denote by using the symbol @xmath11 , so that the length @xmath12 of the @xmath8-th phalanx is @xmath13 as all the phalanxes of a finger belong to the same plane , say @xmath14 , in order to describe the angle between two consecutive phalanxes , say the @xmath15-th and the @xmath8-th phalanx , we just need to consider a one - dimensional parameter , @xmath16 .",
    "each phalanx can lay on the same line as the former or it can form with it a fixed planar angle @xmath17 , whose vertex is the @xmath15-th junction . in other words , two consecutive phalanxes form either the angle @xmath1 or @xmath18 . by introducing the binary control @xmath19",
    "we have that the angle between the @xmath15-th and @xmath8-th phalanx is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 to give a clear description the dynamics of a finger , say the @xmath22-th finger of the hand , we start by simple configurations and we gradually generalize them . assume the @xmath22-th finger to be oriented along a direction @xmath23 parallel to the plane @xmath24 .",

    "the position of the extremal junction of the @xmath8-th phalanx @xmath51 and @xmath52 coincide because no extension is performed , but something in the internal state of the system changes : an `` invisible '' rotation is determined by the control @xmath49 .",

    "we use the symbols @xmath85 and @xmath86 to respectively denote set of reachable and asymptotically reachable points with respect the @xmath22-th finger of the hand .",
