    "in this paper we present the results of a photometric survey for be stars within and around six young clusters in the magellanic clouds .",
    "such studies have been carried out on galactic clusters but they are limited there by the relative paucity of be stars .",
    "the young populous magellanic cloud clusters examined in this paper present us with large samples of be stars in a range of metallicity environments and the opportunity to further examine the mechanism for formation of be stars .",
    "searches for be stars in the magellanic clouds have been made by feast ( @xcite ) using objective prism techniques , and the more recently by grebel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , bessell and wood ( @xcite ) ( who gave a brief description of some of the results presented in this paper ) and grebel ( @xcite ) using ccd - based imaging photometry .",
    "these latter searches involved imaging through an h@xmath0 filter so that be stars , which show strong h@xmath0 emission , stand out in comparison to normal stars .",
    "photometric techniques such as these are very efficient methods of identifying be stars , in particular within dense clusters where spectroscopy is difficult .",
    "the main purpose of the present study is to provide a sample of be stars for follow - up spectroscopy and to see if there are differences in be star populations between different clusters and between clusters and the local field population .",
    "the results of the follow - up spectroscopy will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "because the present study is ground - based , its spatial resolution is seeing limited , which means that we are unable to search for be stars in the cluster cores . in another paper , we will present the results of a search for be stars in the cluster cores using hst imaging .",
    "the present paper provides the comparison sample of be stars in the local field and the outer cluster zones .",
    "the complete data set of ground - based and hst images will allow an accurate comparison of field and cluster be stars properties . in this paper , however , we make some initial comparisons with the more limited data set described herein .",
    "the photometric search method we used to detect be stars involved taking a ccd image through a narrow - band ( 15  ) h@xmath0 filter and comparing this image with a similar image obtained in the cousins @xmath4 band .",
    "stars with strong h@xmath0 emission should appear brighter in the h@xmath0 image than in the r image .",
    "given that a typical be star has h@xmath0 emission with a full width at half maximum of @xmath57   and peak h@xmath0 flux 5 times the local continuum flux , this sort of search with a 15   filter is readily capable of detecting be stars .",
    "the observations were obtained using direct ccd imaging on the 1-m telescope at siding spring observatory from september to november 1991 .",
    "all h@xmath0 images were 900 second exposures .",
    "@xmath4 images were obtained immediately before or after each h@xmath0 image in order to avoid the possibility of stellar variability affecting our measure of emission strength .",
    "a tektronix 1024@xmath61024 ccd with pixels of scale 0.6  was used for these observations , giving us an imaged area of typically 10@xmath610  ( compared with 5.7@xmath65.7  in grebel @xcite ) . @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath3 images were obtained at the same time for some fields , and in some cases on other nights using a gec 770@xmath61152 ccd .",
    "a log of the observations is presented in table  [ obslog ] .",
    "the ccd images were processed with iraf and the photometry of the fields was done using the dophot photometry package ( mateo and schechter @xcite ) .",
    "standard magnitudes in @xmath1 and @xmath3 were derived from the standards used in sebo and wood ( @xcite ) and from magnitudes given by walker ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath4 and h@xmath0 magnitudes were not standardised and @xmath4@xmath2h@xmath0 colours have an arbitrary zeropoint .",
    ".the log of observations presented in the current paper . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ brat ]    in order to compare the be star fraction near the main - sequence turnoff with the be fraction for less evolved stars , we have divided the stars into two groups : the brighter stars with @xmath7 16 and the fainter stars with 17 @xmath8 16 , all stars having @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 @xmath9 0.6 .",
    "the be star fractions for these groups are given for the clusters and their surrounding fields in table  [ brat ] . from these ratios , and looking at figs .",
    "[ fig330bef ] to [ fig2100bef ] , it seems that for most of the clusters and fields there is no statistically significant difference between the be star fractions near the main - sequence turnoff and further down the main - sequence .",
    "there are a few distinct exceptions to this rule : the clusters ngc 330 and ngc 2004 show a significantly higher fractions of be stars near the main - sequence turnoff than at fainter magnitudes , as does the field of ngc 1818 ( where the four brightest main - sequence stars are all be stars ) .",
    "we now examine what our observations imply about the be mechanism . in the literature ,",
    "binarity , pulsation and rotation have been suggested as the mechanism for the establishment and maintainence of the circumstellar material seen in be stars .",
    "harmanec and k@xmath10i@xmath11 ( @xcite ) have suggested that be stars comprise a population of interacting binaries . in this model , elaborated upon by pols et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , emission arises from material in accretion onto the secondary component .",
    "the difficulty that remains with this model is that the expected number of close interacting binaries is too few to account for the observed population of be stars ( vanbever and vanbeveren @xcite ) .",
    "our observations , particularly the high be star ratio in ngc 330 , do not favour the interacting binary hypothesis as the population of stars required to be in mass exchanging binary systems near the ms turnoff ( abt @xcite ) is too high .",
    "the non - radial pulsator model for be activity ( vogt and penrod @xcite ; baade @xcite ) has gained support from the recent work of dziembowski et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . in their models , dziembowski et al .",
    "have shown that an instability domain exists on the main - sequence that almost fills the gap between @xmath12sct and @xmath13cep variables .",
    "these slowly pulsating b - type stars span a range of mass from 3 to 6 @xmath14 .",
    "the be star @xmath15cen has been intensively studied by rivinius et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . from their analysis of photospheric radial velocity variations",
    "they have discerned six discrete periods between 0.27 - 0.51 days .",
    "rivinius et al .",
    "suggest that when the majority of these modes are in constructive interference , expulsion of material and a line emission outburst occurs .",
    "there are problems with associating the magellanic cloud be stars observed here with the pulsation instability mechanism described above .",
    "firstly , in conditions of reduced metallicity such as those within the magellanic clouds , the extent of the pulsation instability domain is reduced ( dziembowski et al .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath13cep instability is seemingly extinguished ( balona @xcite ) .",
    "most importantly , the be stars observed here are by no means confined to a range @xmath166 m@xmath17 .",
    "indeed our observations show that the largest proportion of be stars occurs at @xmath51415 m@xmath17 .",
    "the most widely accepted explanation for the be phenomenon is that it is a result of the rapid rotation of the b star .",
    "this explanation was originally put forward by struve ( @xcite ) . in its modern incarnation , due to bjorkman and cassinelli ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the stellar wind from a rapidly rotating star is concentrated and confined to a disk around the equatorial plane of the star .",
    "the model of bjorkman and cassinelli predicts a maximum likelihood for disk formation near spectral type b2 ( where the stellar angular velocity required for disk formation is 55% that of the critical breakup velocity ) .",
    "observations of galactic be stars find that the highest be star fraction does indeed occur at early spectral types ( b1 according to zorec and briot @xcite ) . within our sample",
    "spectral types are available for only five of our flagged be candidates",
    ". we will present further spectral types in a forthcoming paper .",
    "assuming the be phenomenon is related to the formation of an equatorial disk caused by rapid rotation , we would expect that clusters which form from gas that has a high angular momentum content would contain a high fraction of be stars .",
    "indeed , the evidence is suggestive that galactic clusters whose stars present a higher than average rotational velocity have larger populations of be stars ( mermilliod @xcite ) . in the magellanic clouds ,",
    "the cluster ngc 330 has a noticeably ellipsoidal shape which may suggest that the cluster as a whole formed from material of higher angular momentum and that , as a consequence , the cluster stars have a rapid rotation rate .",
    "this would certainly be consistent with the high be star content of ngc 330 . in a future paper",
    "we will examine the rotation velocities of samples of stars within and around the clusters ngc 330 and ngc 2004 to see if the overall be star fraction is related to average cluster star rotation velocity .",
    "the tendency for there to be a higher be star fraction near the main - sequence turnoff in some clusters also appears consistent with the rapid rotation hypothesis for be star formation .",
    "the evolution of rapidly rotating stars has been examined by endal and sofia ( @xcite ) and endal ( @xcite ) .",
    "these models explicitly follow the radial exchange of angular momentum with evolution .    in the models of endal and sofia , stars commencing their main - sequence lives with relatively slow angular velocity remain slow rotators throughout the whole of the main - sequence evolutionary phase",
    "( although there is a marked increase in angular velocity of all stars during the core contraction phase associated with exhaustion of hydrogen in the core , this evolutionary phase is far too short to account for the observed proportion of be stars ) .",
    "thus slow rotators will never evolve into be stars .",
    "in contrast to the slow rotators , the models of endal and sofia show that stars commencing their lives with an angular velocity greater than 56 - 76% of the critical breakup velocity @xmath18 spin up to the critical velocity over a moderate fraction of the main - sequence lifetime . in a cluster where some fraction of the stars is formed with angular velocity greater than @xmath550% of @xmath18 , those stars nearer the main - sequence turnoff are more likely to be be stars since they will have been more spun up by evolution than the less luminous stars that have not evolved as far through the main - sequence phase .",
    "this process could explain the concentration of be stars to the main - sequence tip seen in ngc 330 , ngc 2004 and ngc 1818 .",
    "we add the cautionary note that endal and sofia ( @xcite ) and endal ( @xcite ) made a detailed study of only a single star which had a mass of 5 m@xmath17 , much less than the turnoff masses of @xmath515 m@xmath17 which is appropriate for the clusters observed here .",
    "for comparison with magellanic cloud data , models such as those of endal and sofia need to be made at higher masses and lower metallicities .",
    "other factors which might influence the be star fraction are metallicity and age . however , neither of these factors seem to influence the be star fractions in our data . to examine abundance dependence",
    ", we note that the two smc clusters are probably more metal poor than the lmc clusters by a factor of about two ( russell and bessell @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the smc , ngc 330 has a high be star content while ngc 346 does not . at the higher abundance of the lmc , clusters with a range of be star content are present , and the range is similar to the range in the smc in spite of the abundance difference between smc and lmc . turning to age , we note that the clusters studied here have ages of @xmath513@xmath610@xmath19 years , although these ages are uncertain by factors of 23 because of uncertainties in the amount of convective core overshoot which occurs in real stars . for comparison of",
    "be star fractions with age , we take from the literature the following ages : ngc 330 , 20 myr ( chiosi et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; ngc 346 , 13 myr ( massey et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; ngc 1818 , 30 myr ( will et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; ngc 1948 , 15@xmath205 myr ( vallenari et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; ngc 2004 , 20 myr ( caloi and cassatella @xcite ) ; ngc 2100 , 15 myr ( cassatella et al .",
    "there does not appear to be any correlation of be star fraction with age : the cluster ngc 330 with the highest be star fraction has an intermediate age and the oldest cluster ( ngc 1818 ) has an intermediate be star fraction .",
    "this result contrasts with the results of mermilliod ( @xcite ) who noted a trend of decreasing be fraction with increasing age amongst young galactic clusters .",
    "we have presented the results of a photometric survey for be stars in six fields centred on ngc 330 and ngc 346 in the smc , and ngc 1818 , ngc 1948 , ngc 2004 and ngc 2100 in the lmc . in all six of these young populous clusters",
    "we find large numbers of be stars .",
    "the be stars are shown to be redder in @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 than main - sequence stars of similar @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , the displacement to the red increases with increasing h@xmath0 emission line strength .",
    "some suggested causes for the redness of be stars were examined using the widely accepted model that be stars are main - sequence stars with a surrounding disk .",
    "our photometric observations suggest that the redness of the stars is due to emission from the circumstellar envelope , in line with the results of detailed spectrophotometric studies based upon galactic samples .",
    "the fraction of main - sequence stars that are be stars varies significantly between the various clusters from @xmath50.100.34 .",
    "the average value is close to the average fraction of @xmath50.17 seen in the galaxy , and the maximum value is also similar to the maximum galactic value , which occurs at spectral type b1 .",
    "it was noted that the cluster with the maximum be star fraction , ngc 330 , is distinctly elliptical , suggesting that the stars in it formed out of rapidly rotating material and that there is a connection between rapid rotation and the be phenomenon .",
    "no connection between be star fraction and age or metallicity was evident . in some clusters ,",
    "the be stars tend to be concentrated toward the main - sequence turnoff .",
    "this is consistent with evolutionary models which predict that stars which form with rotation velocities more than @xmath550% of the breakup value spin up as they evolve , reaching the breakup velocity over a moderate fraction of the main - sequence lifetime .",
