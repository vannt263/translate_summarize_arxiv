    "<S> in quantum statistical mechanics , equilibrium states have been shown to be the typical states for a system that is entangled with its environment , suggesting a possible identification between thermodynamic and von neumann entropies . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate how the relaxation toward equilibrium is made possible through interactions that do not lead to significant exchange of energy , and argue for the validity of the second law of thermodynamics at the microscopic scale .    </S>",
    "<S> the vast majority of phenomena we witness in every day life are irreversible . from the erosion of cliffs under the repeated onslaughts of the ocean to the erasure of our memories , we experience the unyielding flow of time . </S>",
    "<S> thermodynamics , originally the science of heat engines , allows us to predict simple macroscopic processes such as the melting down of an ice cube forgotten on the kitchen table , by the mean of two laws : the conservation of energy and the growth of entropy .    among the wealth of things we are given to perceive , </S>",
    "<S> there are also a few phenomena showing a high degree of regularity . through the trajectories of planets and stars in the sky , through the swinging of a pendulum clock , </S>",
    "<S> we encounter the immutability of time . </S>",
    "<S> these led to the development of mechanics and time - reversible dynamical laws . </S>",
    "<S> this description of nature extends below atomic scale provided that quantum variables , represented by non - commuting operators , are introduced .    </S>",
    "<S> the revolution initiated in the second half of the @xmath0 century by the founders of statistical mechanics was to understand that thermodynamics emerges from the microscopic structure of matter ; this idea had actually been suggested by d. bernoulli in _ hydrodynamica _ ( 1738 ) . </S>",
    "<S> + recently , a new approach to the foundations of statistical mechanics , sometimes called typicality , has been proposed @xcite . rather than the usual time or ensemble </S>",
    "<S> averages , this alternative viewpoint finds its roots in the genuinely quantum notion of entanglement . for a composite system in a pure state , </S>",
    "<S> each component , when taken apart , appears in a probabilistic mixture of quantum states , that is , even individual states can exhibit statistical properties . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the case of a system in contact with a heat bath , it has been shown that its density matrix is generically very close to a thermal state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result has been extended to more complicated couplings between the system and its surrounding ( see @xcite for details and proofs ) . </S>",
    "<S> concretely , one considers a system @xmath1 and its environment , subjected to a constraint @xmath2 ( e.g. fixing the total energy ) . in terms of hilbert spaces </S>",
    "<S> , that means @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> if the number of degrees of freedom composing the system is small compared to the one of the environment , then for most @xmath4 ( in the sense of the haar measure on the unit sphere ) , one gets @xmath5 in other words , in the framework of typicality , the actual state of the system at some instant of time is very likely to resemble the equilibrium state . for that reason , </S>",
    "<S> it is legitimate to use the latter to estimate standard statistical quantities like expectation values of observables or von neumann entropy @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> however , from this perspective , the formulation of a second law of thermodynamics seems at first sight problematic . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is usually taken for granted that fine - grained entropy has to be conserved under the microscopic dynamics imposed by schrdinger s equation , and that thermalization may only be read from a growth in a coarse - grained entropy , such as in boltzmann s @xmath7-theorem . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a very simple and practical resolution of this issue , based on the possibility of creating entanglement without exchanging energy ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for alternative outlooks on this problem ) . for clarity </S>",
    "<S> , we will focus on a single example , prototype of all irreversible transformations , that is the joule - gay - lussac expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the solution suggested here is nonetheless much more general , and is thought to be relevant for all ordinary thermodynamic systems . </S>",
    "<S> + the celebrated experiment , initially studied by gay - lussac and used later by joule , has played a central role in the history of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it consists in the adiabatic free expansion of a gas , initially kept in one side of a thermally isolated container while the other side is empty ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ joule - gay - lussac - exp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the tap separating the two flasks is opened , the gas starts spreading out until homogeneity is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> if the internal energy functional does not depend on the volume , then the initial and final temperatures are found to be equal . </S>",
    "<S> the treatment of the joule - gay - lussac expansion for an ideal gas can be found in all textbooks of thermodynamics and is as follows : there is no exchange of heat nor work between the gas and the outside , and , while the accessible volume is doubled , the entropy of the gas , and therefore of the whole universe , increases by @xmath8 indicating the irreversibility of the process .        on the other hand , it is also instructive to have a mechanical description of the joule - gay - lussac expansion . </S>",
    "<S> assuming for simplicity a monoatomic ideal gas , the dynamics of the @xmath9 particles is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the potential keeping the particles inside the whole container . </S>",
    "<S> liouville s theorem then ensures the conservation of the volume - form induced by the symplectic structure , that is to say , there can be no loss of information whatsoever at the microscopic scale . shifting to quantum mechanics , </S>",
    "<S> the evolution is given by the unitary operator @xmath12 where @xmath13 is simply obtained by canonical quantization of the classical hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> assuming thermal equilibrium , the initial state for the gas reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the potential constraining the particles in one flask only , and @xmath16 is the inverse temperature at which the gas has been prepared . </S>",
    "<S> while the von neumann entropy of the gas initially matches with the thermodynamic one , it is inevitably preserved under the unitary evolution , namely @xmath17    the tension between the irreversible macroscopic thermodynamics and the reversible microscopic mechanics is manifest . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal is that an increase of von neumann entropy is actually allowed by a more careful analysis of what a thermally isolated system is . </S>",
    "<S> + consider a classical particle arriving with a momentum @xmath18 perpendicularly to a wall initially at rest . </S>",
    "<S> assuming an elastic collision , and given the large ratio between the masses of the wall and the particle , one obtains that after the bounce , the particle has a momentum @xmath19 , while the wall has acquired a momentum @xmath20 . the kinetic energy transferred to the wall being negligible </S>",
    "<S> , the energy of the particle is conserved over the bounce with a very good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the classical dynamics of the gas is well described by the effective hamiltonian .    from the point of view of quantum mechanics , </S>",
    "<S> the situation is more delicate . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy and momentum are also conserved during a rebound , so that the state for the composite system made of the particle and the wall evolves from @xmath21 to @xmath22 . by linearity , if the particle started in a superposition @xmath23 , then the unitary transformation associated to the bounce reads @xmath24 and , after tracing out the wall s degrees of freedom , the evolution of the state of the particle becomes @xmath25 which is , in general , not unitary . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the bounce is accompanied with a rise of von neumann entropy .    </S>",
    "<S> the model presented above is of course very schematic , the physics of the interaction between the gas and the container , and the initial state of the latter , are in fact much more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> however , it already shows that such an interaction must affect their quantum correlations , and can lead to an increase of von neumann entropy for the gas ( see @xcite for a general result ) . in other words , at the quantum level , the energy distribution of the gas is conserved yet the evolution is not unitary , and the naive canonical quantization of does not strictly apply .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now possible to derive the final state for the gas from its quantum mechanical description alone . </S>",
    "<S> the space @xmath26 of accessible states is such that the energy distribution for the gas remains unchanged ( for instance , @xmath27 ) . after a transient phase , characterized by a relaxation time @xmath28 , during which the gas and its environment get more entangled , </S>",
    "<S> the state of the universe @xmath29 can be seen as a generic unit vector in @xmath26 . following the conclusion of typicality </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the gas reaches a new equilibrium state , namely @xmath30 as a consequence , after a long - enough time , the variation of von neumann entropy of the gas matches the increase of entropy expected from thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> + let us now have a quick look at a slightly different experiment : the adiabatic reversible expansion of a gas pushing a piston . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the joule - gay - lussac expansion , the temperature of the gas is decreasing as work is performed on the piston . during this process </S>",
    "<S> , the space @xmath26 of accessible states is changing , but its dimension remains constant since the size of the container and the thermal de broglie wavelength are increasing in the same way . </S>",
    "<S> later , if the piston is slowly pushed back , the gas reverts to its initial temperature . in this transformation </S>",
    "<S> , reversibility can not be understood as the possibility to return to the initial microstate , which is practically impossible as soon as a few particles are involved , but only as conservation of von neumann entropy .    on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> when a constraint initially applied to the system is suddenly relaxed , like in joule - gay - lussac s experiment , the space of accessible states is enlarged . the new states , of possibly higher entropy , can only be reached through interaction with the environment . </S>",
    "<S> however , this interaction does not need to involve significant energy transfer , the quantum system remains thermally isolated , and the growth of entanglement is responsible for the irreversibility of its evolution . </S>",
    "<S> + let us mention that the idea of varying entropy without exchanging energy has recently been suggested as a solution to the information loss paradox in black holes evaporation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , at the very last stage of its life , a black hole is believed to have lost almost all its mass in the form of hawking s radiation , leaving a planckian size object and a matter field in a thermal state , with an entropy proportional to the initial black hole area . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it has been argued that a huge amount of information should be encoded adiabatically into correlations with geometric degrees of freedom , in order to ensure purity of the final quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> + to summarize , the second law of thermodynamics , characterizing irreversible transformations , is usually considered at a mesoscopic level , by the mean of a coarse - grained entropy , while no information loss nor thermalization is expected to occur for the fundamental degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the framework of typicality attempts to make use of properties of quantum systems , specifically entanglement , as foundations for equilibrium statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it identifies thermodynamic and von neumann entropies . in that context , it is legitimate to raise the issue of thermalization , namely how an isolated system can reach the maximal entropy state . </S>",
    "<S> the observation that , for quantum systems , being thermodynamically isolated is qualitatively very different from being exactly isolated , opens the possibility of nontrivial quantum interactions without significant exchange of energy , and provides a physical ground for the second law at the microscopic scale . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that recent work involving heat baths in squeezed states also points out the role of quantum correlations in thermodynamic processes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , this approach offers a fresh look at irreversibility . </S>",
    "<S> if the entropy of a system evolving unitarily has to be constant , it is not the case for those of its components . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the nonextensivity of von neumann entropy allows for subsystems to see their entropy growing , due to a stronger entanglement between them , without any contradiction with the conservation of total information . </S>",
    "<S> that might be of relevance for explaining the arrow of time in cosmology : any region of space is constantly interacting with new degrees of freedom entering its past light cone , and , assuming a separable initial state , new quantum correlations can be established . this viewpoint may help us to understand the emergence , locally , of classical mixtures rather than highly - quantum states , and the increase of entropy for the observable universe . </S>"
