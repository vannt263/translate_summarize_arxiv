    "the conjecture of neutrino flavor oscillation has been strengthened by the super - kamiokande ( sk ) @xcite atmospheric neutrino experiment .",
    "this has also been substantiated by k2k long baseline neutrino experimental results @xcite .",
    "the best - fitted values obtained from sk experiment are given by @xmath4 = @xmath5 @xmath6 , @xmath7 = 1.0 @xcite .",
    "moreover , global analysis of all solar neutrino experimental results , including sno salt phase experiment , @xcite is in favor of large mixing angle ( lma ) msw solution of solar @xmath8 deficit problem and this has also in concordance with the kamland @xcite reactor neutrino experimental results .",
    "furthermore , the chooz @xcite experiment has also put an upper bound on the @xmath9 element of the lepton mixing matrix and combined analysis of solar , atmospheric and reactor data put bound on @xmath9 as @xmath10 at @xmath11 c.l @xcite .",
    "there are two other experimental results , one of them , from wmap experiment @xcite on cosmic microwave background anisotropies gives an upper bound on the total neutrino mass as @xmath12 ev @xcite .",
    "the second one , the neutrinoless double beta experiment @xcite has put a bound on majorana - type neutrino mass as @xmath13 = ( 0.05 - 0.84 ) ev at @xmath14 c.l with an uncertanity of the nuclear matrix elements up to @xmath15 .    in view of the above it is worthwhile to investigate appropriate texture of lepton mass matrix which satisfies all those experimental results .",
    "first of all , exact ` bimaximal ' texture is not admissible due to departure of @xmath0 from @xmath16 and the deviation is parametrised in terms of cabibbo angle and the phenomena is referred as ` quark - lepton complementarity ' @xcite . keeping the charged lepton mass matrix flavor diagonal ,",
    "in the present work , we consider a neutrino mass matrix of the form ` bimaximal + democratic ' where the ` democratic ' part of the neutrino mass matrix parametrise the difference @xmath17 .",
    "we have not addressed any typical model in this work , because , there are plenty of literature concerning bimaximal structure of neutrino mass matrix , however , we have indicated possible source of democratic type matrix explicit realization of which needs some extra flavor symmetry .",
    "the present texture gives rise to @xmath18 maximal and vanishing value @xmath19 .",
    "we fit two neutrino mass - squared differences with the required values of solar and atmospheric neutrino experimental results and the remaining mixing angle with the required values of solar neutrino neutrino mixing angle .",
    "these three parameters are fixed by defining a function @xmath20 ( see later ) as the sum of squares of the differences between the calculated values of neutrino oscillation parameters ( with the texture considered ) and the best fitted values of the same ( obtained from different analyses ) and then minimising this function .",
    "the plan of paper is as follows : in section ii , we propose the texture of the neutrino mass matrix and its eigenvalues and mixing angles .",
    "we discuss phenomenological fits of the model parameters through our defined @xmath20 function in section iii .",
    "section iv contains our conclusion .",
    "we consider the following texture of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath21 where the first part @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 and the second part @xmath24 is as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is some scale factor .",
    "thus the entire mass matrix contains three parameters @xmath27 and @xmath26 and we consider all of them to be real . a possible source of the terms which gives rise to ` democratic ' type mass matrix is due to higher dimensional operator @xmath28 through considering equality between the @xmath29 couplings . diagonalizing the entire neutrino mass matrix we obtain the following mixing angles @xmath30 @xmath31 and the eigenvalues are @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "next , we set the solar and atmospheric neutrino mass squared differences as @xmath38 and @xmath39 the best fit values of oscillation parameters from solar neutrino experiment , atmospheric neutrino experiments and solar neutrino mixing angle are used to obtain the values of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath26 . before going to the neumerical fit of the parameters",
    ", we would like to mention that the present mass matrix contains three parameters which are fitted with three experimental values , hence , the the texture has predictions about the neutrinoless double beta decay result and cosmological constraint on total neutrino mass ( wmap experimental result ) .",
    "the predictibility of the texture would increase if we incorporate more symmetries in an explicit model , which necessarilly reduce the number of parameters .",
    "however , since the present texture admits nicely the constraint from wmap experiment , the only testability of the present texture relies crucially on the future experimental results of neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "if this experimental result gives a strong evidence in favour of majorana - type neutrino mass , then the present texture should explain the result or it will be ruled out . in the next section",
    "we will fit those values with the best fit results through our defined @xmath42 function .",
    "the best fit values of oscillation parameters from solar neutrino experiment and atmospheric neutrino experiments are used to obtain the values of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath26 . for this purpose",
    ", we consider @xmath43 , the difference of the square of mass eigenstates @xmath44 and @xmath45 and the mixing angle @xmath46 that are responsible for solar neutrino oscillation and @xmath47 , @xmath48 responsible for oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "a recent global analysis @xcite of the solar neutrino data from all solar neutrino experiments namely chlorine , gallium , super - kamiokande , sno charged current , neutral current including salt phase data , shows that large mixing angle or lma solution is most favoured for solar neutrino oscillation . from the combined analysis with solar neutrino data and kamland experiment",
    "the best fit values of the solar neutrino oscillation parameters are given by @xmath49 for our model ) @xmath50 ev@xmath51 and tan@xmath52 tan@xmath53 for our model ) @xmath54 @xcite . from the analysis of sk atmospheric neutrino oscillation data ,",
    "@xcite we have the best fit values of @xmath55 for our model ) @xmath56 ev@xmath51 and @xmath57 is maximal .",
    "this value of @xmath57 has already been obtained in our proposed texture for @xmath48 . thus treating @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath26 as parameters",
    "we can obtain different values of @xmath43 , @xmath47 and tan@xmath53 and compare them with best fit values of those quantities namely @xmath58 , @xmath59 and tan@xmath60 obtained from the analysis of solar and atmospheric neutrino data ( discussed above ) to fix @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath26 .",
    "to this end we define a function @xmath61 @xmath62 the function @xmath20 as defined above is calculated for a wide range of values of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath26 and the minimum of the function is obtained .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath26 are given below .",
    "@xmath65 @xmath43 , @xmath47 and @xmath66 obtained from the above values of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath26 and their comparison with the best fit values for @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 obtained from recent analysis of the solar and atmospheric neutrino data are shown in table 1 . in order to find out the range of values of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath26 that satisfy the 1@xmath70 limits of @xmath58 and @xmath71 for the ( @xcite ) combined analysis of recent solar neutrino data and kamland data , we have fixed the value of @xmath47 at its best fit value ( shown in table 1 ) and vary the parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath26 such that @xmath72 and @xmath66 satisfy the allowed range mentioned above .",
    "this range as given in ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the allowed region in parameter space of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath26 are shown in a 3d plot ( fig .",
    "1 ) . as seen from fig .",
    "1 , the allowed region is confined in a very narrow band in the parameter space .",
    "we have also found the parameter space in @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath26 for which @xmath47 lies in the 90@xmath75 c.l .",
    "range given by @xmath76 while the other oscillation parameters kept in the previous range .",
    "this range of @xmath47 with 90 % c.l for sk atmospheric neutrino data is obtained from @xcite .",
    "the allowed region in the parameter space of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath26 are shown in the 3d plot of fig .",
    "the value of @xmath26 gives rise to the value of @xmath77 as @xmath78 assuming @xmath79 = 250 gev .",
    "this value of @xmath77 could be recognized as the right - handed symmetry breaking scale in some models which contains an extra @xmath80 or @xmath81 symmetry in which neutrino masses are generated through see - saw mechanism . again",
    ", the sum of the three neutrino mass comes out as @xmath82 = 0.44 ev which is far below from the upper bound of wmap experimental result .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath26 obtained from the best fit result is at the lower end of the present limit on majorana neutrino mass @xmath83ev @xcite obtained from the neutrinoless double beta decay experiment .",
    "although the result is somewhat controversial @xcite , however , the testability of the present model lies crucially on the future experiments such as , exo , moon , genius etc .",
    "we demonstrate that quark - lepton complementarity can be realised in a bimaximal + democratic type neutrino mass matrix which includes two possible sources of neutrino mass .",
    "one of them is the usual bimaximal type arise in different models and a possible source of democratic type is through the incorporation of higher dimensional mass terms assuming equlity between yukawa couplings .",
    "we then fix the parameters through our defined @xmath42 function with the two mass squared differences solar and atmospheric and with the solar neutrino mixing angle .",
    "the texture admits a best fit result at the minimum value of @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , the texture gives rise to a slightly lower value of @xmath84 mass compare to the experimental result of neutrinoless double beta decay experiment , and if the result survives in future with moon , exo , genius experimental results , the present texture will be ruled out .",
