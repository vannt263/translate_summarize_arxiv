    "<S> such a rather short lifetime , compared to about 1ns typically observed @xcite in these structures , is attributed to the selectivity of the fwm technique favoring particularly bright qds with high dipole moment and thus displaying fast population decay dynamics ( less intense transitions in figure[fig : fig1]a are expected to exhibit longer @xmath29 ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig4 ] ]    figure[fig : fig3]b also reveals a pronounced decrease of the initial fwm amplitude at @xmath49 with increasing temperature , such that the signal can not be measured beyond @xmath51k . </S>",
    "<S> this rapid initial decrease is attributed to the phonon - induced dephasing caused by the linear coupling to phonons , which dominates the short - time behavior of the signal . to analyze this effect we measure the coherence dynamics on a picosecond time scale . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in figure[fig : fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the linear coupling describes the fact that the equilibrium positions of the lattice ions in the presence of an exciton are different from their values in the absence of an exciton , i.e. , a polaron is formed . </S>",

    "<S> once the wavepacket has left the qd , the phonon - assisted transitions have dephased and are not further contributing to the fwm . in the @xmath42-dependence of the fwm signal this manifests itself as a fast decay on a timescale of about @xmath53ps @xcite clearly revealed in figure[fig : fig4]b .    </S>",
    "<S> the final value after the initial drop fwm@xmath54 is plotted as a function of temperature in figure[fig : fig4]d . with increasing temperature </S>",
    "<S> the phonon coupling becomes more effective and , accordingly , already at @xmath51k the coherence decays by a factor of 5 during the first @xmath55ps . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why the initial value of the signal seen in figure[fig : fig3]b , where this initial decay is not resolved , rapidly decays with increasing temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> in the spectral domain , the initial decay is associated with a broad phonon background around a zpl @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is seen in the pl spectra taken from the same qd , shown in figure[fig : fig4]c . </S>",
    "<S> for low temperatures the background is asymmetric reflecting the dominance of phonon emission processes over absorption processes , while at higher temperatures , when the thermal occupation of the involved phonons becomes much larger than one , the phonon background becomes symmetric .    </S>",
    "<S> for the theoretical modeling of the signals we employ the standard model of a qd coupled to acoustic phonons via the pure dephasing mechanism @xcite , which has been proven to successfully describe a variety of optical phenomena in single qds and qd ensembles . for this model , exact analytical formulas for linear and nonlinear optical signals after excitation with an arbitrary series of short laser pulses can be obtained within a generating function formalism @xcite . to be specific , </S>",
    "<S> we model the qd trion transition as a two - level system , which is coupled via deformation potential coupling to longitudinal acoustic ( la ) phonons with a linear dispersion relation . assuming an approximately harmonic confinement potential , we take gaussian - shaped wave functions for electrons and holes with electron localization lengths @xmath56 in the in - plane direction and @xmath57 in the out - of - plane direction , i.e. , we model a lens - shaped qd and treat the exciton wave function as a product of electron and hole wave functions .    </S>",

    "<S> we use electron localization lengths @xmath58 nm and @xmath59 nm ( the respective hole localization lengths are scaled by 0.87 ) and assume gaas parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find an excellent agreement between theory and experiment for both the fwm signals and the pl spectra over the whole range of temperatures , however for an increased phonon coupling strength . specifically , to achieve agreement with both the fwm signal and phonon background in pl simultaneously , we had to increase the phonon coupling constant by a factor of 1.5 . </S>",
    "<S> this we model by increased deformation potentials @xmath60ev and @xmath61ev , with respect to the standard parameters @xmath62ev and @xmath63ev , which have previously been used to quantitatively describe various optical signals from qd structures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed discussion of the role of the parameters for the fwm signals and pl spectra can be found in the supplemental information . </S>",
    "<S> while we do not have a definite explanation , we note that similarly higher values for the deformation potentials can also be found in the literature @xcite , and an increased deformation potential has also been used to explain mobilities in a 2deg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one explanation could be that in the present sample there are additional mechanisms like piezo - electric coupling , which are usually negligible but contribute here , e.g. , because of an increased spatial separation of electron and hole wave functions @xcite , leading to an effective increase of the coupling described by larger deformation potentials .    finally , it is instructive to compare the fwm initial decay with the zpl weight in pl ( @xmath64 ) , defined as fraction of zpl in the total absorption spectrum @xcite . within the formalism describing our experiment </S>",
