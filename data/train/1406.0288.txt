    "the problem of action recognition from temporal visual information is a very active research topic with many challenging applications .",
    "a large majority of existing action recognition techniques assumes that the boundaries ( first and last frames ) of individual actions are known in advance .",
    "this gives rise to the per - video approach , i.e. , isolated action recognition , where an action label is assigned to a whole video to be recognized , consequently the latter is described by a single vector , e.g. , the bag - of - word histogram representation framework .",
    "this whole - video paradigm allows one to solve isolated recognition problems using discriminative classifiers . in this paper",
    "we address the more realistic _",
    "continuous action recognition _ problem , i.e. , a video may contain a sequence of unknown actions in an unknown order and with unknown boundary locations between consecutive actions .",
    "this continuous recognition problem is more difficult than the isolated recognition problem because one has to address both classification and segmentation .",
    "the discriminative isolated - recognition framework that we just mentioned can not be easily generalized to deal with segmentation .    in this work ,",
    "continuous recognition is addressed in the framework of dynamic time warping ( dtw ) which has the potential to handle action - level classification and sequence - level segmentation in a concomitant and consistent manner .",
    "the proposed methodology has the following original components : a per - frame time - series representation of videos , a template - based representation of action categories , and a template - to - data alignment process that assigns a label to each video frame .",
    "the method will be referred to as _ dynamic frame warping _ ( dfw ) and two dfw implementations are proposed , namely one - pass ( op - dfw ) and two - pass ( tp - dfw ) dynamic frame warping .",
    "both these dynamic programming ( dp ) algorithms have their roots in the speech domain but , to the best of our knowledge , the extension of continuous speech recognizers to visual action recognition has been overlooked .    in speech ,",
    "the dp - based sequence - to - sequence alignment framework gave rise to two extensions in order to deal with the problem of word recognition from a continuous speech signal , namely one - pass @xcite and two - pass @xcite algorithms .",
    "the one - pass dp approach is used in conjunction with either dynamic time warping ( dtw ) @xcite , @xcite or with the viterbi algorithm @xcite , and it is used today by large - vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems @xcite . the one - pass hidden markov model ( hmm ) , adapted from speech , has been used by continuous sign - language recognizers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the potential attractiveness of the two - pass dp algorithm is that its first pass ( action - level ) can be carried out with virtually _ any _ ( generative or discriminative ) isolated - action recognition method .",
    "it is worth noticing that a few recent continuous action recognition methods use a two - pass strategy in combination with hmms and adaboost @xcite , with svm and semi - markov models ( smm ) @xcite , and with multi - class svm @xcite .",
    "sequence alignment algorithms can use either template - based methods , e.g. , dtw , or probabilistic methods , e.g. , hidden markov models ( hmms ) . within the context of action recognition",
    ", an hmm must be associated with each action category .",
    "this means that one needs to define a set of states for each category and to estimate the hmm parameters for each category , namely the state - transition probabilities and the state - emission probabilities .",
    "these action - level hmms require a large amount of training examples .",
    "moreover , continuous recognition requires that between - action ( or _ jump _ ) probabilities are estimated from an annotated set of videos containing a large number of action - jump examples .",
    "altogether , hmm - based action - level continuous recognition needs a huge amount of training data which may not be available in practice .    one way to reduce the complexity of hmms",
    "is to define action sub - units such that a large number of action types can be described by a small catalog of sub - units .",
    "for example , speech recognizers have successfully used word sub - units such as phonemes , syllables , etc . in the speech domain",
    "these sub - units have a clear acoustic and linguistic interpretation . indeed , there are well defined and well understood language - dependent rules allowing the concatenation of phonemes into words from which within - word state - transition probabilities can be estimated . moreover , there are grammar rules from which between - word transitions can be inferred .",
    "unfortunately , the definition and use of a small catalog of action sub - units turns out to be problematic even in restricted hand - gesture domains , e.g. , sign - language recognition @xcite .",
    "more generally , the use of hmms for the problem of continuous action recognition would require huge amounts of annotated videos in order to train action sub - unit hmms ( one hmm per sub - unit ) as well as action - level and sequence - level hmms .",
    "another drawback of both dp and hmm continuous recognition approaches is that their performance crucially depends upon correctly labeling the first frame of an action to be recognized .",
    "this happens because current models can not account for temporal dependencies beyond the first- or second - order markov assumptions .",
    "the immediate consequence of mislabeling the first frame is that the dp procedure propagates this error to the next frames .",
    "one solution is to use a hidden conditional random fields ( hcrf ) which can deal with long temporal - range data dependencies : rather than depending on the current state , as in hmm , the data are conditionally dependent of all the hcrf s states .",
    "nevertheless , hcrf suffer from the same difficulty of properly inferring between - action transition probabilities from the training data .    in order to circumvent the above mentioned problems encountered with current approaches",
    ", we propose a novel way of representing actions based on _ action templates _ and we show how this representation can be cast in one - pass and two - pass dp algorithms .",
    "we address the problem of devising a template representation that captures the inherent actor - dependent variabilities occurring within action categories .",
    "we also address the problem of how to encode _ jumps _ between templates , such that the first and last frames of every action , present in a long sequence of unknown actions , are robustly detected and labeled . to summarize , the paper has the following contributions :    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]             + ( a ) an example of a  run \" test - sequence .",
    "+           + ( b ) dfw failed to align this test sequence with metaframes from the  run \" template .",
    "+           + ( c ) op - dfw correctly aligned the test sequence with metaframes from the  run \" template .",
    "+           + ( d ) an example of a  fight - person \" test - sequence .",
    "+           + ( e ) dfw failed to align this test sequence with metaframes from the  fight - person \" template .",
    "+           + ( f ) op - dfw correctly aligned the test sequence with metaframes from the  fight - person \" template .",
    "the problem addressed in this paper , continuous action recognition , is more challenging than isolated recognition because action classification and action - boundary detection must be simultaneously carried out .",
    "for this reason , per - video ( or global - video ) representations , widely used by isolated recognition methods , are not appropriate because these representations do not embed between - action information , which is needed to detect transitions from one action to another .    we propose a novel methodology based on sequence alignment using a per - frame representation .",
    "we build on the well known dynamic time warping framework and devise a novel representation of actions based on templates .",
    "an action - template is a time - series of metaframes that are produced by mutual alignments between all the training examples associated with a category .",
    "this per - metaframe representation allows to account for the large variabilities associated with actions in different contexts and performed by various people .",
    "when different actions are continuously performed , action - transition information is implicitly encoded in the data .",
    "therefore , it is not only necessary to describe within - action information but between - action information as well . in order to incorporate this kind of knowledge we use a sliding temporal window , centered at each frame , and",
    "whose length is adjusted onto the data , such that a minimum number of spatiotemporal features are included in a frame descriptor , regardless of the  speed of action \" . using training examples that consist in long sequences composed of several annotated actions , it is therefore possible to encode between - action information in the first and last frames of each action in the training data .",
    "the proposed one - pass dynamic frame warping method simultaneously labels the frames of a test sequence and detects jumps between consecutive actions .",
    "we claim that the dual use of within - action and between - action transitions can also handle periodic motions formed of repetitive motion patterns . in this case",
    ", a periodic motion is viewed as a sequence of motion patterns and the op - dfw algorithm is able to jump from pattern to pattern .",
    "we also discuss how a null - class can be incorporated into this one - pass framework .    for completeness , we also propose an alternative continuous recognition algorithm that proceeds sequentially : recognition followed by segmentation , namely two - pass dynamic frame warping .",
    "we analyze in detail the algorithmic complexity of both algorithms and conclude that op - dfw has the same order of complexity as the standard dtw algorithm . hence , the proposed extension is barely more complex than isolated recognition based on sequence alignment .",
    "tp - dfw is more complex because it has to consider a large number of sub - sequences of the test sequence .",
    "nevertheless , one advantage of tp - dfw over op - dfw is that it can allow consecutive actions to slightly overlap .",
    "we conducted a thorough experimental comparison which provides evidence that op - dfw outperforms two state of the art methods that were recently proposed @xcite , @xcite .",
    "tp - dfw and the two methods just cited share similar recognition and segmentation performances , which is not surprising at all since the three methods rely on the same two - pass strategy .",
    "although isolated recognition is not the primarily objective of our work , we also conducted experiments with two isolated - action datasets , hollywood-1 and hollywood-2 , and we provided detailed comparisons with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the periodic actions of hollywood-1 , e.g. , hand - shake , do not seem to affect our method which outperforms @xcite .",
    "hollywood-2 contains twelve actions .",
    "there are two periodic actions , fight - person and run , for which @xcite performs better than our method . with both these datasets we used the same isolated recognition algorithm , based on dynamic frame warping , and which only makes use of within - action transitions .    in the future we plan to extend our method to audio - visual data .",
    "indeed , human activities are often synchronized with speech or prosodic sounds .",
    "it is therefore tempting to define audio - visual descriptors that combine visual and acoustic features .",
    "a recent gesture recognition challenge provides a multimodal dataset ( color , depth and audio ) @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that out of 17 teams that submitted their results , only one team used dynamic programming for segmentation .",
    "the winning team proposed an hmm method for audio recognition and segmentation , and dynamic time warping for skeletal classification .",
