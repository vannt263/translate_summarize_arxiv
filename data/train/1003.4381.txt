    "several mechanisms of the generation of neutrino masses and mixing in the context of a supersymmetric model have been explored in various works .",
    "one of the most popular attempts in this direction is to relax the assumption of r - parity conservation in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) by including explicit bilinear and/or trilinear r - parity violating interactions in the superpotential and the scalar potential@xcite .",
    "one can also consider models with spontaneous r - parity violation @xcite via a singlet sneutrino vacuum expectation value .",
    "the low energy limit of such models , where the singlet sneutrino field is decoupled , can be thought of as the bilinear r - parity violating scenario .",
    "thus there are several possibilities within the context of r - parity violation in mssm .",
    "in fact , each of them has been studied in detail in connection with the observed neutrino mass patterns and mixing as provided by the neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the possible collider signatures of r - parity violating models have also been studied in great details and correlation between neutrino mixing angles and the decay branching ratios of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) have been obtained @xcite .",
    "another interesting and well studied procedure of small neutrino mass generation in a supersymmetric model , with the observed mixing pattern , is the seesaw mechanism@xcite with the introduction of right - handed neutrino superfields@xcite . in order to generate small neutrino masses ,",
    "one introduces @xmath2 = 2 heavy majorana mass terms in the superpotential in addition to the trilinear lepton - number conserving yukawa interactions involving the right - handed neutrino superfields .",
    "as long as the neutrino yukawa couplings are of order one , light neutrino masses",
    "@xmath3 ev require the majorana masses to be @xmath4 gev or so .",
    "however , such a high seesaw scale is difficult to probe at the lhc or future linear collider experiments .",
    "a viable alternative is to look at _ tev - scale _ seesaw mechanism where small active neutrino masses are generated with the help of neutrino yukawa couplings as small as @xmath5 ( same as the electron yukawa coupling ) and this makes the majorana mass scale of the right - handed neutrino of the order of @xmath6 tev plausible .",
    "this gives one an opportunity to test the seesaw models at the lhc .",
    "the signatures of tev scale supersymmetric seesaw models will be briefly outlined later along with a discussion of the signatures of r - parity - violating models .    on the other hand ,",
    "mssm is plagued by the so - called",
    " @xmath1-problem \" which asks the question that why the scale of the supersymmetry preserving @xmath1-term should be of the same order as the soft supersymmetry breaking terms , which are of the order of tev .",
    "one of the possible solutions to this problem is the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , where a standard model singlet superfield ( @xmath7 ) is introduced to the mssm superfields with a coupling @xmath8 in the superpotential ( for review and phenomenology see@xcite ) .",
    "the scalar component of @xmath9 gets , in general , a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the order of @xmath6 tev , as long as the soft mass parameters corresponding to the singlet scalar field are in the same range .",
    "this solves the  @xmath1-problem \" because the @xmath1-parameter generated in this way has the right order of magnitude if one considers a coupling @xmath10 . in order to generate active neutrino masses and appropriate mixing in the neutrino sector one either includes r - parity violation in the superpotential@xcite and the scalar potential or introduces gauge - singlet neutrino superfields @xmath11 with appropriate couplings with the mssm superfields and the singlet superfield @xmath12@xcite . in the latter case , the gauge - singlet neutrino superfields @xmath11 can have majorana masses around the tev scale if there is a coupling of the type @xmath13 in the superpotential .",
    "when the scalar component of @xmath9 gets a vev of the order of tev scale , the right handed neutrinos also acquire an effective majorana mass around the tev values as long as the dimensionless coupling @xmath14 is order one@xcite .",
    "here it is assumed that the superpotential has a discrete @xmath15 symmetry which forbids the appearance of bilinear terms in the superpotential @xcite .    in this study , within the framework of this tev scale seesaw model mentioned above , we calculate the one - loop contributions to the neutrino mass matrix with r - parity conservation and study the effect of these contributions to the neutrino mass patterns and mixing angles . in other words",
    ", we consider the case where only the scalar field corresponding to the singlet superfield @xmath16 gets a non - zero vev along with the neutral higgs fields .",
    "we will show later that these one - loop contributions can be significant and can change the region of parameter space allowed by the three - flavor global neutrino data in comparison to the tree level results .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we will provide a discussion on the three - flavor neutrino mixing and illustrate the general pattern of our analysis that we are going to follow .",
    "sec.iii describes the model along with the minimization conditions of the neutral scalar potential .",
    "one - loop contributions to the neutrino mass matrix in the r - parity conserving scenario and the resulting neutrino mass patterns , which satisfy the three flavor global neutrino data , are discussed in sec.iv with numerical results . in sec.v",
    "we outline the possible ways to probe this model at the lhc and present a short critical discussion of the signatures of neutrino mass models involving spontaneous and/or bilinear r - parity violation .",
    "we summarize in sec.vi with possible future directions .",
    "the solar , atmospheric , accelerator , and reactor neutrino experiments have shown strong evidence in favor of non - zero neutrino masses and mixing angles@xcite . in addition , there is an upper bound on the sum of neutrino mass eigenvalues @xmath61 ev from cosmological observations@xcite .",
    "the bound on the 11-element of the neutrino mass matrix resulting from the non - observation of neutrinoless double beta decay is @xmath170.3 ev@xcite .",
    "the global 3-flavor fits of various neutrino oscillation experiments point toward the following 3@xmath18 ranges of the neutrino oscillation parameters , namely the two mass - squared differences and three mixing angles@xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "one can see from these numbers that there are two large mixing angles and one small mixing angle among the three light neutrinos with a mild hierarchy between the mass eigenvalues .",
    "the three flavor neutrino mixing matrix @xmath21 can be parametrized as follows , provided that the charged lepton mass matrix is already in the diagonal form and the dirac as well as majorana phases are neglected :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 run from 1 to 3 .    the mixing angle data coming from solar , atmospheric and reactor sector indicate that @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "this is popularly known as the bilarge pattern of neutrino mixing . in order to understand the consequences of such mixing in the _ zeroth",
    "_ order , one considers the tri - bimaximal structure of the neutrino mixing@xcite where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . with this tri - bimaximal pattern ,",
    "the unitary neutrino mixing matrix turns out to be @xmath32 considering @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 as the three light neutrino mass eigenvalues , we use the matrix @xmath36 to obtain the neutrino majorana mass matrix in the flavor basis as    @xmath37    we can see that a particular structure of neutrino mass matrix emerges from the requirement of tri - bimaximal mixing , in terms of the neutrino mass eigenvalues . given a specific model for generating the neutrino mass matrix , one can easily connect the model parameters with the neutrino mass eigenvalues with the help of eq.([neutribi ] ) .",
    "this way one can study the normal , inverted or quasi - degenerate mass pattern of the light neutrino mass eigenvalues and try to see the requirement on the model parameters to produce the tri - bimaximal pattern of neutrino mixing . in this work , we will try to explore the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) where neutrino mass is generated because of the introduction of three right - handed neutrino superfields with the possible interaction terms .",
    "though the assumption of tri - bimaximal mixing in the neutrino sector is not generic , in the present context it is quite illustrative in studying the role of the soft susy breaking parameters on the neutrino mass eigenvalues . at the same time , the acceptable domain of the soft parameters consistent with neutrino mass eigenvalues and tri - bimaximal mixing angles would hardly change with any small shift in @xmath38 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , this model was proposed in ref.@xcite where the case with spontaneous violation of r - parity was studied with possible implications on neutrino mass eigenvalues and mixing angles at the tree level . in the present study we shall consider the case when r - parity is conserved and the neutrino mass generation at the tree level is entirely due to the seesaw mechanism involving the tev scale right handed neutrinos .",
    "our aim would be to see if this model can produce the acceptable neutrino mass eigenvalues and mixing angles when the neutrino mass matrix receives contributions at the tree as well as one - loop level .",
    "an attractive feature of this model is that , the right handed sneutrino in the form of lsp may become a valid cold dark matter candidate of the universe@xcite .",
    "this model can also accommodate spontaneous cp and r - parity violation simultaneously . in that case , the neutrino sector is cp violating and the resulting effects on the neutrino masses and mixing angles were studied in ref.@xcite . similarly , spontaneous r - parity violation motivated by a flavor symmetry may produce tri - bimaximal mixing pattern in the neutrino sector@xcite .",
    "however , in the present context we consider the case where neutrino sector conserves cp symmetry along with r - parity .",
    "there have been some other studies which address the neutrino experimental data in some other extensions of nmssm .",
    "one of these proposals is discussed in ref.@xcite , where the effective bilinear r - parity breaking terms are generated through the vacuum expectation value of the scalar component of the singlet superfield @xmath9 . in this case , only one neutrino mass is generated at the tree level whereas the other two masses are generated at the one - loop level . in another model@xcite , non - zero masses for two neutrinos are generated at the tree level by including explicit bilinear r - parity violating terms along with the r - parity breaking term involving @xmath9 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , the r - parity violating nmssm model may offer a valid dark matter candidate in the form of gravitino as the r - parity violating decay channels of the gravitino are extremely suppressed because of weak gravitational strength@xcite .    in another class of models ,",
    "gauge - singlet neutrino superfields were introduced to solve the @xmath1-problem , which can simultaneously address the desired pattern of neutrino masses and mixing@xcite .",
    "the detailed study of neutrino masses and mixing in this model was presented in ref.@xcite and the correlations of the lightest neutralino decays with neutrino mixing angles were discussed . subsequently the dominant one - loop contributions towards the tree level neutrino masses have also been presented@xcite .",
    "similar analyses for one and two generations of gauge - singlet neutrinos were presented in ref.@xcite and some other phenomenological implications , in particular the possible signatures at lhc were addressed .",
    "neutrino masses consistent with different hierarchical scenarios and tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing can also be generated in an r - parity violating supersymmetric theory with tev scale gauge singlet neutrino superfields , where the @xmath1-term was not generated by the vacuum expectation values of the singlet sneutrino fields @xcite .",
    "another interesting avenue in this direction is to study the role of possible higher dimensional supersymmetry breaking operators in the hidden sector which may render the tev scale soft susy breaking trilinear and bilinear couplings involving the sneutrinos to produce the observable mass and mixing angles for the neutrinos@xcite .",
    "in this section we review the model along the lines of ref.@xcite and discuss its important characteristics .",
    "we introduce the singlet superfield @xmath7 along with three right - handed neutrino superfields @xmath39 .",
    "the superfields @xmath39 are odd and the superfield @xmath7 is even under r - parity .",
    "the most general superpotential consistent with r - parity conservation is @xmath40 where @xmath41 here @xmath42 and @xmath43 are down - type and up - type higgs superfields , respectively .",
    "the @xmath44 are doublet quark superfields , @xmath45 $ ] are singlet up - type [ down - type ] quark superfields .",
    "the @xmath46 are the doublet lepton superfields , and the @xmath47 are the singlet charged lepton superfields .",
    "the indices @xmath48 are generation indices .",
    "note that we have imposed a @xmath15 symmetry under which all the superfields have the same charge .",
    "this symmetry forbids the appearance of the usual bilinear @xmath1-term in the superpotential .",
    "the @xmath1-term is generated spontaneously through the vacuum expectation value of the singlet scalar @xmath7 . in a similar way",
    "soft supersymmetry breaking potential can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 includes the mssm soft supersymmetry breaking terms along with a few additional terms as shown below : @xmath51 the term @xmath52 is composed of the soft masses and the trilinear interactions corresponding to the fields @xmath53 : @xmath54 we have taken a common trilinear coupling @xmath55 for the singlet fields @xmath56 and @xmath0 and @xmath57 is a mass scale . in a supergravity motivated scenario ,",
    "it is a common practice to choose @xmath58 and also a universal trilinear parameter for the fields @xmath0 , @xmath53 .",
    "since these fields are gauge singlet , we assume such universality to hold also at the electroweak scale .",
    "similarly , the mass parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are very much insensitive to renormalization group equation ( rge ) running and their values at the weak scale can be taken to be the same as the values at the high scale .",
    "in addition , we have chosen all the parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65,@xmath66 and @xmath67 to be real .",
    "the scalar potential of this model can be written as @xmath68 where the neutral part of @xmath69 and @xmath70 can be written as    @xmath71    in the above , the repeated indices always mean to sum over the generations .",
    "however , the summation sign is used in special cases if required .",
    "the vevs are determined by the minimization of the potential ( eq.([scalerpot ] ) , ( [ vf ] ) and ( [ vd ] ) ) . here",
    "we explore the possibility when only scalar component of the gauge singlet superfield @xmath16 acquires a vev along with the doublet higgs fields .",
    "the right - chiral sneutrino @xmath72 can only have a vanishing vev and thus r - parity is unbroken . on the other hand , when the right - chiral sneutrino @xmath73 acquires a vev then r - parity is spontaneously broken and an effective bilinear r - parity violating term of the form @xmath74 is generated , where @xmath75 .",
    "however , the case of spontaneous r - parity violation will be studied in a separate work@xcite .",
    "note that , a global continuous symmetry such as lepton number can not be assigned to the superpotential involving the singlets @xmath16 and @xmath11 .",
    "thus this model is completely free from the unwanted nambu - goldstone boson even if the singlet scalar @xmath0 and/or * @xmath53 * acquire vev . for more details the reader is referred to ref.@xcite .",
    "minimization of the scalar potential ( eq.([scalerpot ] ) ) leads to the following conditions@xmath76    @xmath77    here @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gauge couplings , respectively , and @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath81 is the soft susy breaking mass parameter of the left chiral sneutrinos .",
    "we have assumed that the neutral scalar fields can develop , in general , the following vacuum expectation values @xmath82 as has already been mentioned , in the present context we will consider the solutions @xmath83 and @xmath84 to analyze the neutrino spectra . in our subsequent discussion , we will also ignore the terms in the minimization equations which are bilinear in the neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "note that in order to generate very small masses for the active neutrinos ( @xmath850.1 ev ) using this tev scale seesaw mechanism , the neutrino yukawa couplings ( @xmath86 ) should be below @xmath87 , which is around the magnitude of the electron yukawa coupling .",
    "the vev @xmath88 comes out as the solution of the following cubic equation ( neglecting the yukawa term ) , @xmath89 the solutions of the foregoing equation involve soft parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in fact",
    "these parameters can not be much away from tev values to have @xmath88 @xmath6 tev .",
    "in particular , the soft parameter @xmath91 and @xmath90 are crucial to produce non zero vev for the field @xmath0 . any consistent solution that yields @xmath93 but @xmath94 requires @xmath95 and also @xmath96 , @xmath97 gev , @xmath98 gev@xcite .",
    "similarly we also choose the couplings @xmath65 , @xmath99 in such a manner so that the condition for global minima is always satisfied .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    let us now discuss in detail the generation of neutrino masses and mixing in this model . note that this model is different from the models where mssm is extended with three right - handed singlet neutrino superfields .",
    "this is because in those models the right handed neutrino mass scale is not tied up with the electroweak symmetry breaking scale and is assumed to be very high ( @xmath4 gev or so ) .      at the tree level ,",

    "note that , in eq.([loopcoeff1 ] ) we have neglected a term @xmath112 in the expression for @xmath113 since it is much smaller compared to the other terms .    the tree level neutrino masses may receive dominant radiative corrections at the one - loop level .",
    "it has been shown in models of mssm with right - handed neutrino superfields , that the loop contributions can be as large as the tree level value , though the result depends on the soft susy breaking parameters @xcite . in @xmath114-parity conserving scenarios the leading contribution to neutrino masses at the one - loop level arise from @xmath115 terms in the sneutrino sector .",

    "this effective majorana sneutrino mass term in turn induces one - loop radiative corrections to neutrino majorana masses via the self - energy diagram as shown in fig.[looprpc ] .",

    ", we show our numerical results to identify the regions in the parameter space consistent with the normal , inverted and quasi - degenerate neutrino mass pattern . in the numerical computation",
    "we choose different soft parameters and couplings in such a way , that the proper minima condition of the scalar potential is always satisfied@xcite .",
    "the choices of various parameters are listed below .",
    "the value of @xmath190 is taken to be equal to 10 .",
    "in addition to that , other parameter choices are + ( i ) superpotential parameters : @xmath191 , 0.2 cm @xmath192 , 0.2 cm @xmath193 , + and + ( ii ) soft susy breaking parameters : @xmath59 = 100 gev , @xmath194 = 300 gev , @xmath195 = 100 gev , @xmath91 = 100 gev , @xmath196 = 1000 gev .",
    "+ apart from the above parameters which are fixed to the quoted values , we have also varied the parameter @xmath90 in the calculation .",
    "this would cause changes in @xmath88 ( eq.([vs_soln ] ) ) , which in turn produces variation in the neutrino spectrum .",
    "we list the values of @xmath90 and @xmath88 in table i.    .different values of @xmath88 corresponding to the different values of the coupling parameter @xmath90 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the two mass - squared differences shown in eq.([eq : data ] ) indicate three possible neutrino mass hierarchies@xcite , namely    1 .",
    "normal hierarchy : this neutrino mass pattern can be established if @xmath197 and @xmath35 are related with the observables @xmath198 and @xmath199 as @xmath200 however , in principle @xmath33 can also be much smaller than @xmath34 or even be zero .",
    "since in this case @xmath35 is much greater than both @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we can approximately use the relation shown in eq.([nor - cond ] ) for illustration .",
    "2 .   inverted hierarchy : this hierarchical scenario can be achieved if one chooses @xmath201 we assume the maximum possible value for @xmath35 to be @xmath202 ev while the minimum value could be vanishing . obviously , the solar mass squared difference @xmath203 will come from the small mass splitting between @xmath34 and @xmath33 , where @xmath204 .",
    "hence , for a simple minded analysis we can assume that @xmath205 .",
    "3 .   degenerate masses : finally this scenario is defined by @xmath206 here we assume that the upper bound of the neutrino masses could be @xmath207 ev , which comes from the cosmological observations .",
    "the lower bound is chosen to be @xmath208 ev .    in fig[fig",
    ": nor_hie ] , three neutrino mass eigenvalues @xmath209 , consistent with the normal hierarchical pattern , are plotted as functions of neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "the difference in the contours manifests how the neutrino masses depend on the soft bilinear coupling parameter ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the variation occurs , as @xmath88 depends on ( @xmath90 ) , thereby acquiring a different value at the global minima which has already been mentioned in table  [ tablevs ] .",
    "in particular @xmath210 always increases as we increase @xmath211 parameter which in turn increases the right handed neutrino masses .",
    "this results into a smaller value for @xmath212 . on the other hand , loop correction does not increase appreciably by this small variation of @xmath90 if @xmath196 is around tev scale as we will discuss later .",
    "we should note here that neutrino loop correction is always an order of magnitude smaller compared to the tree level value for the parameters we have chosen .",
    "thus with increase in @xmath90 parameter , one requires large values of yukawa couplings to satisfy the neutrino data .",
    "the red zone in each contour ( fig[fig : nor_hie ] ) represents the range of the yukawa couplings that can satisfy the neutrino data .    in case of inverted hierarchy",
    ", we have shown the variation of @xmath35 with the respective yukawa couplings in fig.[fig : inv_hie - a ] .",
    "the other mass parameters @xmath197 depend on the yukawa coupling @xmath213 , but that can be estimated from the fig.[fig : nor_hie - b ] if in that plot we replace @xmath35 in the y - axis by @xmath214 and @xmath215 in the x - axis by @xmath213 ( eq.([neumass ] ) ) .",
    "in fact knowing the value of the yukawa coupling @xmath213 would allow us to determine the coupling @xmath216 .",
    "the fig.[fig : inv_hie - b ] depicts the variation of @xmath35 with the yukawa coupling @xmath216 for quasi - degenerate mass scenario . in this scenario ,",
    "the neutrino spectrum is approximately degenerate i.e. , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 turn out to be almost identical if one chooses @xmath217 much smaller compared to the diagonal yukawa coupling @xmath216 , which essentially means that @xmath218 .",
    "finally a few comments on the dependence of the one - loop contribution to the neutrino mass on the soft susy breaking parameters @xmath90 and @xmath196 .",
    "the loop contribution is always suppressed unless the parameter @xmath196 is sufficiently large as can be seen from fig.[aneu_hie ] . as for illustration ,",
    "the yukawa couplings are chosen as @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "similarly , we choose @xmath221 = 60 gev and @xmath222 = 120 gev , where @xmath221 and @xmath222 are the @xmath223 and @xmath224 gaugino mass parameters , respectively . for larger values of electroweak gaugino masses , the one - loop contribution would be reduced further . for @xmath90 = -1 tev ,",
    "higher @xmath196 values @xmath6 13 tev can satisfy the current neutrino data .",
    "however , even if @xmath196 is @xmath6 13 tev , the quantity @xmath225 is very small , i.e. , @xmath3 gev .",
    "note that for such a choice of the parameter space , the tree level values of the neutrino masses are not sufficient to accommodate the three flavor global neutrino data .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath90 requires relatively smaller value of @xmath196 ( @xmath6 7 tev ) to reproduce the neutrino data .",
    "it is very important to point out that , for a fixed @xmath65 and @xmath152 one can not increase the trilinear coupling parameter @xmath90 to an arbitrary high value as the right - chiral sneutrinos may turn out to be tachyonic .",
    "thus , a relatively larger soft trilinear parameter @xmath196 is required to enhance the one - loop contribution to neutrino masses .",
    "with @xmath226 in the normal hierarchical scenario .",
    "all mass parameters are in gev.,width=288,height=288 ]    the requirement of a large @xmath196 can be understood from the following discussion .    *",
    "the one - loop contribution to the neutrino mass originating from the mass splitting in the left - handed sneutrinos depends on the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath196 and @xmath227 as can be seen from eqs.([loophabermass1 ] ) and ( [ sneutrino - mass - splitting ] ) .",
    "it has been argued in ref.@xcite , that in order to have the one - loop contribution to the neutrino mass comparable to its tree level value , the ratio @xmath228 should be @xmath229 . * substituting @xmath172 and the expression for @xmath227 from eq.([exprn - bn - mn ] ) , we may write @xmath230",
    ". we can see from the above expression that one may increase either @xmath90 or @xmath226 parameter to enhance the one - loop contribution to make it countable .",
    "but in the present context , raising the soft parameter @xmath90 alone would not serve the purpose .",
    "this is because the vev @xmath88 increases significantly with @xmath211 ( table .",
    "[ tablevs ] ) .",
    "thus there is always a partial cancellation between different terms in the above expression for the left sneutrino mass splitting . in particular ,",
    "the effective bilinear coupling @xmath227 is reduced because of this partial cancellation .",
    "in addition , we choose the sign of the coupling @xmath64 as negative in order to determine the correct global minima .",
    "this also causes a partial cancellation between various terms , but to a lesser extent .",
    "considering this cancellation effect in mind , it is easy to check that the ratio @xmath231 always reside near the value @xmath232 with the soft parameters @xmath226 and @xmath227 around the tev scale .",
    "* now , as mentioned above , the trilinear coupling parameter @xmath90 is restricted if one does not want the right chiral sneutrinos to become tachyonic .",
    "of course this depends on the choice of the soft  dirac \" mass term @xmath60 of the @xmath72s , which we have chosen to have a quite moderate value ( 300 gev ) in this case .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath226 can be pushed to a reasonably high value without affecting any other results .",
    "this explains why a large @xmath226 parameter is required to make the one - loop contribution to the neutrino mass comparable to its tree level value .",
    "it is extremely important to investigate the possible signatures of this tev scale seesaw mechanism at the lhc .",
    "one of the search strategies could be to produce the right - handed neutrino @xmath233 ( or the corresponding right - handed sneutrino @xmath73 ) with a large enough cross - section and then look at the decay branching ratios in different available modes .",
    "however , in this type of models the production of tev scale right - handed neutrinos ( or sneutrinos ) at the lhc is suppressed by the light neutrino mass @xcite . nevertheless , it is possible to construct models where the production mechanism of the right - handed neutrino ( sneutrino ) can be decoupled from the neutrino mass generation .",
    "for example , extended gauge symmetries such as @xmath234 or @xmath235 may offer extra gauge bosons near the tev scale whose couplings to quarks and the right - handed neutrino ( sneutrino ) are unsuppressed @xcite .",
    "in such models a single or a pair of right - handed neutrinos can be produced with large cross sections leading to dilepton signals ( same - sign ) with no missing energy ( see the first reference of @xcite and @xcite ) , trilepton signals @xcite or four - lepton signals @xcite .    in the context of the present model the left - sneutrino  majorana \" mass term can lead to oscillation between the left - chiral sneutrino and the corresponding anti - sneutrino @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as the observation of a sneutrino decaying into a final - state with a  wrong - sign \" charged lepton . in order to have a large oscillation probability the total decay width @xmath236 of the sneutrino / antisneutrino and the mass splitting @xmath237 must be of the same order . since @xmath237 is constrained by the neutrino data",
    ", one needs a very small total decay width of the sneutrino / antisneutrino .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this can be achieved in a scenario where the lighter stau is long - lived and the left - chiral sneutrino can only have 3-body decay modes involving the lighter stau in the final states .",
    "this can lead to signals such as like - sign dileptons , single charged lepton plus like - sign di - staus ( leading to heavily ionizing charged tracks ) or like - sign di - stau charged tracks at future linear colliders @xcite or at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the resulting charge asymmetry of the final states can be measured to get an estimate of the sneutrino - antisneutrino oscillation probability @xcite .",
    "in addition , for a very small sneutrino decay width one can also observe a displaced vertex in the detector .",
    "however , a detailed study of such signals in the context of the present model is beyond the scope of the present paper .    in comparison",
    ", now we discuss briefly the signatures of r - parity violating models in general . in models with spontaneous violation of r - parity",
    ", the singlet sneutrino vacuum expectation value leads to the existence of a majoron which is an additional source of missing energy .",
    "this can change the decay pattern of the lightest higgs and the lightest neutralino with the corresponding signatures at the lhc . for more details and the relevant references",
    "the reader is referred to ref.@xcite . in the case of bilinear r - parity violation , the ratios of certain decay branching ratios of the lsp show very nice correlation with the neutrino mixing angles .",
    "this can lead to very interesting signatures at the lhc where comparable numbers of events with muons and taus , respectively , can be observed in the final state @xcite .    from the above discussion",
    "we see that the canonical type - i supersymmetric seesaw case that we have considered in this paper has characteristic signatures which can be tested at the lhc . at the same time",
    "one can also distinguish the predictions of this model with those of the models with spontaneous or bilinear r - parity violating scenarios .",
    "we have studied the neutrino masses and mixing in an r - parity conserving supersymmetric standard model with three right handed neutrino superfields @xmath107 and another gauge singlet superfield @xmath104 .",
    "this model is similar to the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , where the scalar component of @xmath104 gets a vev to generate a @xmath1-term of correct order of magnitude .",
    "in addition , the same vev also generates tev scale majorana masses for the right handed neutrinos .",
    "the small neutrino masses are generated at the tree level by the usual seesaw mechanism at the tev scale .",
    "we also calculate the one - loop contribution to the neutrino mass matrix and investigate the constraints on the model parameters to produce the tri - bimaximal pattern of neutrino mixing for three different neutrino mass hierarchies .",
    "neutrino mass matrix gets contribution at the one - loop level controlled by the sneutrino  majorana \" mass terms .",
    "we show that the one - loop contribution can be important for certain choices of the soft susy breaking parameters .",
    "this we have demonstrated by evaluating the one - loop contribution in two different ways . in particular , we observe that the one - loop contributions can be significant when the soft susy breaking trilinear parameter @xmath225 is @xmath238 gev ) with @xmath239 10 tev .",
    "this observation is quite robust and does not change much if one introduces a small @xmath38 in the neutrino sector .",
    "our choice of neutrino yukawa couplings also predict vanishing contributions to the lepton flavor violating processes @xmath185 and @xmath186 as well as an extremely suppressed contribution to @xmath187 .    as has been stated earlier , it is also possible to have non - zero vacuum expectation values for the left and right chiral sneutrinos . in that case , r - parity is violated spontaneously .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix can have contributions from two different sources , namely , the effective bilinear r - parity violating interactions and the tev - scale seesaw mechanism .",
    "one - loop contributions to the neutrino mass matrix can be very important in this case too .",
    "however , the tree level and one - loop calculations are rather involved and require a separate discussion altogether .",
    "we plan to present these results in a subsequent paper@xcite .",
    "the characteristic signatures of this model at the lhc include like - sign dilepton ( without missing energy ) , trilepton or four lepton final states as well as single lepton plus two heavily ionizing charged tracks or only two heavily ionizing charged tracks stemming from long - lived staus . by looking at these signals one can possibly distinguish this model from the models of spontaneous or bilinear r - parity violation .",
