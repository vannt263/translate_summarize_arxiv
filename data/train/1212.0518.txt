    "a popular and highly successful mechanism to account for the growth of complex networks is preferential attachment  @xcite . here",
    "new nodes are added sequentially to a network and each links to existing nodes according to an attachment rate @xmath3 that is an increasing function of the degree @xmath4 of the ` target ' node to which linking occurs .",
    "many real world networks appear to evolve according to this simple dynamics  @xcite .",
    "preferential attachment networks naturally divide into three classes : sublinear , linear , and superlinear , in which the attachment rate grows with the degree of the target node as @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "each class of networks has qualitatively different properties .",
    "linear preferential attachment is the most well studied class .",
    "this growth rule leads to scale - free networks , but with a _ fragile _ power - law degree distribution . here",
    ", the term fragile denotes that the exponent of the degree distribution depends sensitively on microscopic details of the growth mechanism .",
    "in contrast , sublinear preferential attachment leads to networks with a universal stretched - exponential degree distribution .",
    "superlinear preferential attachment networks are singular in character , as they contain one highly - connected `` hub '' node whose degree is of the order of the total number of nodes in the network  @xcite .",
    "a basic feature of the preferential attachment growth rule is that each new node must ` know ' the degree distribution of the entire network , as this global information is exploited to determine the identity of the target node .",
    "however , since real - world networks are typically large , it is unreasonable to expect that any new node has such global knowledge .",
    "a possible resolution is to use a redirection rule in which a new node only knows about some local portion of the network and attaches to a node in this region .",
    "as we will discuss , redirection generates linear preferential attachment growth by suitably - defined local growth rules  @xcite .",
    "an attractive feature of redirection is that this algorithm leads to extremely efficient simulations of network growth  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce an extension of the redirection algorithm that produces networks that grow according to _ sublinear _ preferential attachment . in classic redirection ,",
    "each new node attaches to either : ( i ) a randomly chosen target node with probability @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a fixed number strictly between 0 and 1 , or ( ii ) the parent of the target , with probability @xmath1 .",
    "we will show that a related redirection algorithm leads to sublinear preferential attachment growth when @xmath1 is a suitably - chosen decreasing function of the degree of the parent node .",
    "thus sublinear preferential attachment can also be achieved from a local growth rule .",
    "furthermore , we will demonstrate that no local redirection algorithm can produce superlinear preferential attachment .",
    "our claim may help explain why linear and sublinear preferential attachment networks are found ubiquitously in empirical studies  @xcite , while evidence for superlinear attachment networks are relatively scarce  @xcite : most real - world networks truly _ do _ grow according to local rules and thus can not be governed by superlinear preferential attachment .",
    "we begin with a summary of well - known basic aspects of preferential attachment and then describe how to achieve this type of network growth by redirection . let @xmath9 be the total number of nodes in a growing network and @xmath10 be the number of nodes of degree @xmath4 . for simplicity",
    "we consider directed tree - like networks , in which each new node has a single outgoing link .",
    "thus a node of degree @xmath4 will have a single parent ( the node it first attached to upon entering the network ) and @xmath11 children .",
    "we assume the network begins with a single node , which is thus its own parent .",
    "more general initial conditions give the same results when number of network nodes is sufficiently large .",
    "the network grows by introducing new nodes into the network sequentially .",
    "each new node attaches to a pre - existing node of degree @xmath4 with attachment rate @xmath3 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath10 with the addition of each node is thus governed by  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total attachment rate .",
    "the first term @xmath14 gives the probability that the new node attaches to a pre - existing node of degree @xmath15 ; this connection converts the node to have degree @xmath4 , thereby increasing @xmath10 by @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , the term @xmath17 corresponds to the probability that the new node connects to a node of degree @xmath4 , thereby decreasing @xmath10 by @xmath16 .",
    "finally , the term @xmath18 arises because every new node has degree 1 and so increases @xmath19 by 1 .    in sublinear and linear preferential attachment",
    ", it can be shown  @xcite that the total attachment rate scales as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a constant .",
    "in contrast , for superlinear attachment , the total rate scales as @xmath22 because @xmath13 is dominated by the term in the sum that is associated with the hub , whose degree is of order @xmath9 . the formal solution for @xmath10 can be readily obtained by writing @xmath23 and using @xmath20 in to give  @xcite @xmath24 for sublinear preferential attachment , the asymptotic behavior may be found by writing the above product as the exponential of the sum of a logarithm , converting the sum to an integral , expanding the logarithm in inverse powers of @xmath25 , and then performing the integrals .",
    "these manipulations lead to a degree distribution that asymptotically has the stretched exponential form @xmath26\\,.\\ ] ] for linear preferential attachment , and more generally for shifted linear attachment , where @xmath27 , the asymptotic degree distribution has the _ non - universal _ power - law form @xmath28n  @xcite . here @xmath29 must satisfy the constraint @xmath30 ; otherwise , network evolution is pathological because it is not possible to attach to nodes of degree 1 .",
    "we now discuss how a suitably - defined redirection algorithm leads to a complex network whose growth is governed by _ sublinear",
    "_ preferential attachment .",
    "we assume that the network starts in a configuration in which each node has one parent .",
    "let us first review the classic redirection algorithm that leads to shifted linear preferential attachment  @xcite .",
    "the steps to add a new node to the network are as follows :    1 .",
    "randomly select an existing node as the target .",
    "a new node attaches to the target with probability @xmath0 , with @xmath2 .",
    "3 .   with probability @xmath1",
    ", the new node attaches to the parent of target .",
    "this growth rule is local because each new node only needs to know about a single randomly - chosen node and its immediate environment , rather than the entire network structure .",
    "this redirection algorithm can be straightforwardly extended to allow the new node to make connections to multiple nodes in the network  @xcite .",
    "the surprising aspect of this innocuous redirection mechanism is that it leads precisely to linear preferential attachment for the case @xmath31",
    "@xcite , a growth rule that ostensibly requires knowing the degrees of all nodes in the network .    ) of a random target ( of degree @xmath32 ) occurs with probability @xmath33 , while attachment to the target occurs with probability @xmath34 .",

    ", scaledwidth=65.0% ]    we now generalize the redirection algorithm to allow @xmath36 to be a function of the degrees of the target and ancestor nodes , @xmath32 and @xmath37 , respectively ( fig .  [ r ] ) . to show how sublinear preferential attachment can be achieved from this still - local information ,",
    "let us define @xmath38 as the total probability that an incoming link is redirected _ from _ a randomly - selected target node of degree @xmath4 to the parent of the target .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath39 as the total probability that an incoming link is redirected _ to _ a parent node of degree @xmath4 after the incoming node initially selected one of the child nodes of this parent .",
    "formally , these probabilities are defined in terms of the redirection probabilities by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the correlation function that specifies the number of nodes of degree @xmath32 that have a parent of degree @xmath37 .",
    "thus @xmath38 is the mean redirection probability averaged over all @xmath10 possible target nodes of degree @xmath4 . likewise , since each node of degree @xmath4 has @xmath11 children , there are @xmath43 possible target nodes whose redirection probabilities are averaged to give @xmath39 .    in terms of these probabilities @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the master equation that governs",
    "the evolution of @xmath10 is @xmath44 the first ratio corresponds to instances of the growth process for which the incoming node actually attaches to the initial target node .",
    "for example , the term @xmath45 gives the probability that one of the @xmath10 target nodes of degree @xmath4 is randomly selected and that the link from the new node is _ not _ redirected away from this target .",
    "similarly , the second ratio corresponds to instances in which the link to the target node _ is _ redirected to the parent .",
    "for example , the term @xmath46 gives the probability that one of the @xmath43 children of nodes of degree @xmath4 is chosen as the target and that the new node _ is _ redirected .",
    "lastly , the term @xmath18 accounts for the newly - added node of degree 1 .    by simple rearrangement",
    ", we can express the master equation in the generic form of  , with attachment rate given by @xmath47 as a simple check of this expression , note that when the redirection probability is constant , we have @xmath48 and the expected linear dependence @xmath49 is recovered .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the attachment rate in is @xmath50 .",
    "thus a redirection probability @xmath33 for which @xmath39 is a decreasing function of @xmath4 will asymptotically correspond to sublinear preferential attachment .",

    "once a network reaches @xmath57 nodes , we measure the probability that attachment to a node of degree @xmath4 actually occurs by systematically making ` test ' attachments to each node of the network according to generalized redirection .",
    "the term test attachment means that the network is returned to its original state after each such event .",
    "we count all test events that ultimately lead to attachment to a node of degree @xmath4 . dividing this number of events by the total number of nodes @xmath9 gives the attachment probability to nodes of degree @xmath4 , @xmath17 .",
