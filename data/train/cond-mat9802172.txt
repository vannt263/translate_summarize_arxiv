    "in recent experiments @xcite , a very unusual temperature ( @xmath4 ) dependence of resistivity was observed in quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) organic conductors @xmath5 ( at the ambient pressure ) and @xmath6 ( at a pressure about 9 kbar ) @xcite in moderately strong magnetic fields @xmath7 of the order of 10 t at @xmath8 k. unexpectedly large magnetoresistance in these materials has already attracted attention in earlier measurements @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 materials consist of one - dimensional ( 1d ) conducting chains parallel to the crystal axis * a * ( for general reviews of the @xmath1 materials , see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the chains are weakly coupled in the two others directions * b * and * c * , the coupling in the * c * direction being much weaker than in the * b * direction .",
    "in zero magnetic field or in the field parallel to the * b * axis , the resistivity of @xmath6 along the chains , @xmath9 , depends on temperature approximately quadratically : @xmath10 @xcite , which is consistent with the standard fermi - liquid theory @xcite , provided resistivity is dominated by electron - electron scattering .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied along the * c * axis , @xmath9 does not change appreciably at high temperatures ; however , below a certain magnetic - field - dependent temperature @xmath11 k , resistivity starts to grow with decreasing temperature : @xmath12 at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "in other words , the behavior of the system changes from metallic , @xmath14 , to insulating , @xmath12 , when the temperature is lowered below @xmath15 .",
    "the temperature @xmath16 increases with the increase of magnetic field .",
    "such a behavior is very surprising in view of the fact that no thermodynamic phase transition is observed in the system at this relatively high temperature @xmath11 k. ( a phase transition into the magnetic - field - induced spin - density - wave ( fisdw ) state takes place at the transition temperature @xmath17 k , which is an order of magnitude lower than @xmath16 . )",
    "as the temperature is lowered further below @xmath16 , @xmath18 continues to grow until another temperature scale @xmath19 is reached .",
    "magnetoresistance is huge at @xmath20 : @xmath9 at @xmath21 t is about 10 times greater than @xmath9 at @xmath22 @xcite . at the lower temperatures",
    "@xmath23 , behavior of the system starts to depend crucially on the exact orientation of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "if the magnetic field lies in a plane formed by the direction * a * of the chains and another integer crystallographic direction , such as * c * or @xmath24 , @xmath9 recovers the metallic behavior @xmath14 at @xmath23 . for other , generic orientations of the magnetic field",
    ", @xmath9 retains the nonmetallic behavior , either continuing to grow with decreasing temperature : @xmath12 , or saturating at a high constant value .",
    "the temperature @xmath25 does not depend appreciably on the magnetic field . if at @xmath23 the magnetic field is rotated in the plane perpendicular to the direction * a * of the chains , @xmath9 exhibits sharp minima when the field is aligned with the integer planes described above ( the so - called `` magic angles '' effect ) .",
    "this effect was discovered experimentally earlier @xcite following the theoretical suggestion by lebed @xcite . finally , at low temperatures",
    ", the system may enter the magnetic - field - induced spin - density - wave ( fisdw ) phase at the transition temperature @xmath26 k , where @xmath9 increases sharply .",
    "other diagonal components of the resistivity tensor of @xmath6 seem to behave similarly to @xmath9 : the angular dependence of @xmath27 @xcite at @xmath23 and the temperature dependences of @xmath27 @xcite and @xmath28 @xcite appear to be qualitatively similar to those of @xmath9 .",
    "however , in the very recent measurements @xcite it was found that , when the magnetic field is oriented along the magic direction * c * , @xmath27 monotoniuosly decreases with temperature , whereas @xmath9 and @xmath28 exhibit a minimum at @xmath29 . when the magnetic field is tilted away from * c *",
    ", @xmath27 develops a minimum at a temperature much lower than @xmath16 for @xmath9 and @xmath28 .    in @xmath5 , a magnetic field also causes @xmath18 , as well as the nmr relaxation rate @xmath30 , to grow with decreasing temperature at @xmath13 @xcite , which is an indication of a nonmetallic behavior induced by the magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the angular and temperature dependences of @xmath27 in @xmath5 are quite different from those in @xmath6 and can be interpreted within the standard fermi - liquid picture .",
    "the behavior of @xmath5 may or may not @xcite be complicated by doubling of the crystal period in the * b * direction occurring in this material at @xmath31 k. to avoid complications , we will focus our theoretical study on @xmath6 , which has a simple crystal structure .",
    "the behavior of resistivity in @xmath6 completely contradicts the conventional fermi - liquid picture of a metal with an open fermi surface . in this picture , applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of the chains should produce no or very little magnetoresistance , should not alter the metallic temperature dependence of resistance , and should exhibit no magic angles effect @xcite .",
    "thus , unconventional theoretical approaches are required .",
    "we suggest that the following theoretical picture may qualitatively account for the unusual behavior of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it is well known theoretically ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the orbital effect of a * c*-axis magnetic field @xmath7 on a q1d conductor is characterized by the cyclotron energy @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the electron charge , @xmath34 is the distance between the chains in the * b * direction , @xmath35 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath36 is the speed of light . for the realistic values of the model parameters ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : h ] ) , we estimate that @xmath37 k / t .",
    "the magnitude of the cyclotron energy , @xmath38 k at @xmath21 t , is close to the temperature of the resistivity minimum at that magnetic field , @xmath39 k. taking into account that the minimum of resistivity clearly has a magnetic origin ( it does not exist without magnetic field ) , and @xmath16 grows with the increase of magnetic field , we suggest that the minimum of resistivity occurs when the temperature reaches the energy scale of the magnetic field ; that is , @xmath40 .",
    "now we need to identify the nature of the second energy scale in the problem , the temperature of the resistivity maximum , @xmath25 . at the temperatures @xmath41",
    ", it appears that @xmath9 depends only on the magnetic field projection on the @xmath42 axis perpendicular to the * a * and * b * directions @xcite . from this observation , we may conclude that at @xmath41 the system behaves effectively as a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system ; that is , the coupling between the chains in the * c * direction is not relevant . on the other hand , at @xmath23 the coupling along the * c *",
    "axis becomes important .",
    "this is manifested by the magic angles effect , which is an essentially three - dimensional ( 3d ) phenomenon involving both the * b * and * c * axes .",
    "the coupling between the chains along the * c * axis is characterized by the electron tunneling amplitude @xmath43 , whose magnitude is believed to be of the order of 10 k @xcite , which is close to @xmath44 k. thus , we suggest that the electron tunneling amplitude @xmath43 sets the temperature scale @xmath45 of the resistivity maximum : @xmath46 . this conjecture is supported by the experimental fact that @xmath25 ( unlike @xmath16 ) does not depend appreciably on the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we also need to mention that , according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the coupling between the chains in the * b * direction , @xmath47 , is much greater than the temperatures discussed in our paper : @xmath48 k.    taking into account these energy scales , we identify three qualitatively different regimes in the behavior of a q1d system in a magnetic field :    \\1 ) high temperatures : @xmath49 . in this region ,",
    "the temperature is greater than both the magnetic energy @xmath50 and the electron tunneling amplitude @xmath43 along the * c * axis , but lower than the tunneling amplitude @xmath47 along the * b * axis .",
    "thus , we may neglect both the magnetic field and the coupling between the chains along the * c * axis and treat the system as a normal 2d fermi liquid without magnetic field .",
    "this results in the quadratic law @xmath10 and the metallic behavior of the resistivity @xmath14 .",
    "\\2 ) intermediate temperatures : @xmath51 . in this region ,",
    "the temperature is still greater than the coupling between the chains along the * c * axis , so the system remains 2d ; however , the effect of the magnetic field becomes important .",
    "it is known that , in the presence of a magnetic field along the * c * axis , the motion of electrons along the * b * axis becomes quantized , and the dispersion law of electrons becomes one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy of the electron spectrum in the * b * direction is a specific manifestation of the landau degeneracy in a magnetic field in the case of a 2d system with a strong q1d anisotropy .",
    "this phenomenon is called `` one - dimensionalization '' of a q1d system by a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "even though the spectrum of electrons becomes 1d and their wave functions become localized in the * b * direction , the wave functions still spread over many chains ( if @xmath52 ) , which results in a considerable interaction between different chains @xcite .",
    "so the system is not truly 1d , because it does not consist of completely decoupled 1d chains .",
    "nevertheless , we may expect that , at least , some 1d features would be present in this regime and , via a mechanism that need to be specified , would lead to an insulating transport behavior @xmath12 . in general , 1d systems have stronger tendency toward insulating behavior than higher - dimensional systems , because various insulating mechanisms , such as renormalization of umklapp scattering , density - wave instabilities , and anderson localization , are more effective in one dimension than in higher dimensions .",
    "so the conjecture that the insulating behavior is caused by the magnetic - field - enforced `` one - dimensionalization '' is plausible , but requires detailed studying of a specific mechanism @xcite .",
    "we review possible candidates for the mechanism in the next section and quantitatively analyze one of the mechanisms in rest of the paper .",
    "\\3 ) low temperatures : @xmath53 . in this region",
    ", the coupling between the @xmath54 planes becomes important .",
    "the magnetic field pointing exactly along the * c * axis does not affect the electron motion along that axis .",
    "thus , in addition to the magnetic - field - enforced 1d dispersion law discussed in part 2 ) , the system acquired an extra dispersion in the * c * direction and becomes effectively 2d , which results in a metallic , fermi - liquid behavior @xmath14 . if the magnetic field does not point along the * c * axis , the component of the field perpendicular to the * c * axis suppresses the energy dispersion along that axis , so the system remains effectively 1d and insulating : @xmath12 .",
    "if the direction of the field is close to the * c * axis , we expect resistivity to decrease with decreasing temperature in the range @xmath55 and to start increasing again at @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the cyclotron energy of the electron motion along the * c * axis , which is proportional to the projection of the magnetic field perpendicular to the * c * axis .",
    "the same arguments apply not only to the * c * axis , but also to the @xmath24 axis and other integer crystallographic directions @xmath58 .",
    "however , because the electron tunneling amplitudes in these directions decrease rapidly with the increase of the integers @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the effect is clearly visible experimentally only for the @xmath24 axis .    in summary",
    ", we suggest that the unusual transport behavior of @xmath6 results from the changes in the effective dimensionality of the system caused by the applied magnetic field .",
    "the system is 2d at @xmath61 and effectively 1d at @xmath62 . at @xmath63",
    "the system is effectively 2d for the magic orientations of the magnetic field and effectively 1d for generic orientations .",
    "whenever the system is 2d ( or 3d ) , it is a normal fermi liquid , and the temperature dependence of resistivity is metallic . whenever the system is effectively 1d",
    ", the temperature dependence of resistivity is insulating .",
    "the latter state of the system might be called the magnetic - field - induced luttinger insulator ( mfili ) , by analogy with the term `` luttinger liquid '' , which refers to the metallic state of a 1d system @xcite .",
    "we do not have detailed mathematical calculations that can prove the heuristic picture outlined in this section .",
    "nevertheless , we can predict some experimental effects based on this picture . in refs .",
    "@xcite , oscillations of @xmath27 upon rotation of a magnetic field in the @xmath64 plane were discovered by danner _",
    "_ following the theoretical suggestion of ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that a small magnetic field along the * b * axis destroys the oscillations @xcite .",
    "we predict that if a magnetic field is rotated in the magic plane from the @xmath65 direction toward the * a * direction , the danner oscillations should exist , even though the magnetic field has a finite * b*-component .",
    "the suggested geometry has an advantage over the geometry of experiment @xcite , where the magnetic field had a fixed * b*-component , that the danner oscillations would not be mixed up with the lebed oscillations occurring when the magnetic field is rotated in the @xmath66 plane .",
    "this prediction is based on the idea that the danner oscillations require that the electron motion in the third direction is not suppressed by the magnetic field , which happens only when the magnetic field belongs to a magic plane .",
    "we also predict that the danner oscillations should disappear at @xmath41 , where the electron dispersion in the third direction is smeared out by temperature .",
    "a detailed study of magnetic oscillations upon rotation of the magnetic field around the @xmath67 axis with different tilts relative to the @xmath67 axis was recently performed by lee and naughton @xcite .",
    "they found possible to interprete most , but not all , of the results within a conventional semiclassical theory of metals .",
    "within the heuristic framework presented in the previous section , a theoretical study of the problem reduces to the following two parts :    \\(a ) how a magnetic field induces the negative temperature dependence of resistivity @xmath12 in a 2d metal with a strong q1d anisotropy .",
    "( 2d problem )    \\(b ) how the electron tunneling in the third direction does or does not suppress the effect found in part ( a ) depending on the orientation of the magnetic field in the @xmath66 plane .",
    "( 3d problem )    from the above formulation , it is clear that the 3d problem ( b ) can be addressed only after the 2d problem ( a ) has been solved . in other words ,",
    "we believe that the insulating temperature dependence of resistivity ( problem ( a ) ) and the drop of resistivity at the magic angles ( problem ( b ) ) have a common origin .",
    "however , until recently , theoretical and experimental efforts were focused on solving problem ( b ) without recognizing and addressing problem ( a ) .",
    "soon after the experimental discovery of the magic angles @xcite , a number of theories tried to explain this effect semiclassically @xcite .",
    "the theories @xcite found the magic angles effect in @xmath28 and @xmath27 , but not in @xmath9",
    ". microscopic analysis @xcite of the `` hot spots '' model @xcite demonstrated that it can not explain the huge magnetoresistance and the magic angles effect . in all of these models ,",
    "resistivity was calculated by introducing a relaxation time @xmath68 phenomenologically and studying semiclassical electron trajectories in the momentum space .",
    "these theories assumed that relaxation mechanism does not change dramatically as the magnetic field is rotated . in view of experiment",
    "@xcite , this assumption is completely wrong , because it is the switching between metallic and insulating states and the corresponding change in the relaxation mechanism that causes the magic angles effect .",
    "another explanation of the magic angles was proposed on the basis of the luttinger liquid concept in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "this theory suggested that the magic angles effect reflects the change of the effective dimensionality of the system : the system is a 2d luttinger liquid at generic angles , and a 3d normal fermi liquid at the magic angles .",
    "the prediction of the theory that even a small * b*-component of the magnetic field would destroy coherence of the interchain hopping in the * c * direction was confirmed experimentally in ref .",
    "however , this theory focuses only on problem ( b ) , but does not address the issue of the temperature dependence of resistivity and does not explain how problem ( a ) may be solved .",
    "moreover , in the actual calculations @xcite , @xmath43 is treated as a perturbation to a 1d system , and the much greater tunneling amplitude @xmath47 is effectively neglected .",
    "for this reason , the theory @xcite actually studies the dimensionality crossover between 2d and 1d , not 2d and 3d , and the very important * c*-component of the magnetic field does not appear in these calculations .",
    "the very first calculation of the angular dependence of @xmath9 was done by lebed and bak @xcite before the experimental discovery of the magic angles . however , it predicted maxima , not minima , of resistance at the magic angles .",
    "this discrepancy was corrected in the subsequent work @xcite . in this theory , resistivity @xmath69",
    "is studied by calculating the rate of umklapp scattering @xmath70 in the lowest order of perturbation theory .",
    "this approach allows to study how resistivity depends on temperature and on the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the temperature dependence of the scattering rate changes with the magnetic field orientation : @xmath71 at the magic angles and @xmath72 at generic angles , because the electron dispersion law is 2d and 1d in these cases , respectively . at low enough temperatures , the difference between the @xmath73 and @xmath4 laws should result in sharp dips of resistance at the magic angles .",
    "however , the theory predicts that both temperature dependences are metallic ( @xmath14 ) , whereas experimentally the temperature dependence is insulating ( @xmath12 ) for nonmagic angles at @xmath13 and for all angles at @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "thus , the theory @xcite is not adequate either .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , lebed and bak considered also the scattering rate of electrons on impurities renormalized by the electron - electron interaction in the lowest order and noted that it grows with decreasing temperature , when a magnetic field is applied .",
    "it is easy to check analytically that this scattering rate is approximately constant without magnetic field and , if @xmath43 is neglected , grows as @xmath75 in a magnetic field at @xmath76 .",
    "we calculated this diagram numerically in the 2d case and found that it increases by only about 20% in the relevant range of fields and temperatures , which is insufficient to explain the experiment .",
    "( our numerical calculation of the umklapp electron - electron scattering diagram in the 2d case also confirmed that application of a magnetic field changes the temperature dependence of @xmath70 from @xmath73 to @xmath4 at @xmath76 , as discussed in the preceding paragraph . )",
    "after the magnetic - field - induced insulating temperature dependence of @xmath9 was discovered experimentally , theory started to address this problem specifically .",
    "@xcite suggested that resistance increases at @xmath13 , because the `` one - dimensionalization '' of @xmath1 by a magnetic field induces formation of a pseudogap in the charge channel .",
    "it is well known that charge and spin excitations are independent in a 1d system @xcite . in the presence of umklapp scattering and repulsive interactions , charge excitations may develop a pseudogap , whereas spin excitations may remain gapless .",
    "this results in insulating temperature dependence of resistivity coexisting with metallic behavior of spin susceptibility .",
    "this effect is observed experimentally in the sulfur - based compounds @xmath77 @xcite , which are more 1d than the selenium - based compounds @xmath1 ( see refs .",
    "induction of a charge pseudogap by a magnetic field would explain insulating behavior of all components of the resistivity tensor in @xmath6 @xcite and the nmr data in @xmath5 @xcite ( although the transverse resistivity in @xmath5 behaves differently @xcite ) .",
    "however , in order to achieve quantitative agreement with the experiment , this theory assumes that @xmath78 k @xcite or 1530 k @xcite , which is almost an order of magnitude smaller that the commonly accepted value @xmath79 k deduced from the * b*-axis plasma edge @xcite and the ( * a*,*b*)-plane angular magnetic oscillation @xcite . in this theory , the magnitude of the pseudogap is determined by the energy scale where the renormalization - group ( rg ) equations ( also called the parquet equations @xcite ) for the forward , backward , and umklapp scattering amplitudes of electron - electron interaction diverge .",
    "however , because the chains are strongly coupled , it is not correct to limit the rg equations to only those three amplitudes of interaction",
    ". it is necessary to include an infinite number of the amplitudes of interaction between different chains , which makes the rg equations integro - differential @xcite . for a q1d conductor in a magnetic field ,",
    "the integro - differential rg equations were derived and solved numerically without umklapp in refs .",
    "the temperature where a solution of the rg equations diverges was interpreted in the latter papers as the fisdw transition temperature @xmath80 . on the other hand , in a purely 1d case",
    ", the energy where a solution of the rg equations diverges is conventionally interpreted as a pseudogap energy , not as a transition temperature , because thermodynamic phase transitions are not possible in 1d systems @xcite .",
    "thus , the problem is whether the rg equations for a q1d conductor in a magnetic field can simultaneously describe formation of a pseudogap at a high temperature and the fisdw transition at a much lower temperature . in a purely 1d case this is possible , because the rg equations separate exactly into two independent sets of equations for the spin and charge channels @xcite .",
    "however , in a higher - dimensional case , all of the interaction amplitudes are coupled , and separation of the rg equations into independent channels does not seem feasible .",
    "it is not clear why a pseudogap energy and a fisdw transition temperature would differ by an order of magnitude in the rg approach , if both are produced by the same mechanism of `` one - dimensionalization '' and enhancement of the peierls susceptibility by a magnetic field .",
    "even after the rg equations are solved , the temperature dependence of resistivity still needs to be calculated .",
    "this issue was addressed in the theory by gorkov @xcite , which suggested that resistivity is given by the same diagram that was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , but with a renormalized , temperature - dependent umklapp scattering amplitude . in the standard model of the fisdw transition @xcite , where @xmath81 , and electron - electron interaction is repulsive",
    ", it is safe to neglect the superconducting channel contribution to the rg equations @xcite . in this case , the rg equations reduce to the conventional ladder - rpa equations .",
    "the umklapp scattering amplitude , renormalized according to these equations , grows when @xmath82 . because @xmath9 is proportional to the square of the umklapp amplitude",
    ", the insulating regime @xmath12 might be achieved if the umklapp amplitude grows faster than the phase space factor @xmath4 or @xmath73 decreases .",
    "one might expect , though , that resistivity would start to grow only in a narrow vicinity of the fisdw transition , not at the temperatures an order of magnitude higher than @xmath80 .",
    "whether this approach can quantitatively explain the experiment , particularly the role of a magnetic field , can be verified by numerical calculations . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we study this issue in detail .",

    "we studied the fisdw precursor scenario suggested by gorkov @xcite in detail both analytically and numerically ( sec .  [ sec : q1d][sec : nmr ] ) and found that it does not agree with the experimental observations . in the rest of this section",

    "\\1 . within the fisdw precursor scenario",
    ", we studied only the umklapp scattering rate @xmath70 . in the language of feynman diagrams ,",
    "@xmath70 is related to the imaginary part of the electron self - energy @xmath316 . via the kramers - kronig relations for @xmath316",
    ", any precursor effects in im@xmath316 should also affect re@xmath316 . because re@xmath316 is related to the electron density of states , a pseudogap may open in the single - electron spectral density as a precursor of fisdw .",
    "potentially , the pseudogap may affect transport properties of the system as strongly as the renormalization of scattering rate studied in this paper .",
    "re@xmath316 also determines the residue @xmath317 of the single - electron green function , which is finite for a fermi liquid and vanishes for a luttinger liquid .",
    "re@xmath316 can be straightforwardly calculated using the methods of this paper .",
    "on the other hand , relationship between the single - electron and transport properties is not straightforward .",
    "for example , the residue @xmath317 may cancel out from resistivity due to the ward identities @xcite .",
    "reliable calculations of resistivity require taking into account corrections to the vertex of interaction between electrons and electromagnetic field , which is a difficult problem for inelastic electron - electron interaction @xcite .",
    "the ladder approximation utilized in this paper does not take into account contributions from superconducting channel , which , on one hand , plays a very important role in one dimension and , on the other hand , is sensitive to a magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field may induce an insulating behavior by suppressing superconducting fluctuations , which compensate insulating fluctuations at zero magnetic field . including both density - wave and superconducting channels naturally leads to the parquet equations .",
    "if the parquet equations in a magnetic field @xcite are generalized to include the umklapp amplitude , one may try to find out whether they can be decomposed into two disconnected sets of equation analogously to the spin - charge separation in 1d case .",
    "this is a nontrivial possibility , because the number of coupled equations is infinite , and the equations are nonlinear .",
    "nevertheless , if the equations do decouple , the two sets of equations would diverge at two different temperatures , one of which could be identified with @xmath16 and another with @xmath80 .",
    "an additional technical problem is that the equations of refs .",
    "@xcite are applicable only at @xmath318 , whereas @xmath319 , so the parquet equations need to be derived in the difficult range @xmath320 .",
    "the parquet approach may require to assume a rather small effective value for @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "electron - electron scattering contributes to electrical resistivity only via the umklapp processes , which do not conserve the total electron momentum @xcite . for commensurate systems , such as @xmath1 , the umklapp scattering process that changes the total electron momentum by @xmath141 , where @xmath321 is the lattice spacing in the * a * direction ,",
    "is usually considered . however , in the presence of a magnetic field , the total electron momentum may also change by a multiple of @xmath124 , the wave vector of the magnetic field . since this kind of umklapp exists only in a magnetic field , it may be a natural source of magnetoresistance in a q1d system .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that this mechanism works effectively only at @xmath318 .",
    "this could generate @xmath319 without invoking pseudogaps originating from renormalization , whose values tend to be close to @xmath80 . on the other hand , this mechanism would not explain the insulating behavior of the transverse resistivities @xmath322 and @xmath323 and the nmr relaxation rate .",
    "however , the recent experiment @xcite , where metallic temperature dependence was found for @xmath323 and insulating for @xmath0 and @xmath322 , may be in favor of this or another kinetic mechanism and against a charge - gap scenario .    undoubtedly , the anomalous temperature dependence of resistivity in q1d conductors in a magnetic field poses a tough theoretical challenge and solving this difficult puzzle would greatly enrich the condensed - matter physics .",
