    "the violent density fluctuations caused by the sn shock wave can change the adiabaticity at the @xmath7 resonance in a time dependent manner , thus leaving their imprint on the time dependent neutrino spectra @xcite . in particular , the observations of the time dependent neutrino spectra can confirm the presence of forward as well as reverse shock wave through the `` double dip '' feature @xcite , and in addition can track the positions of the shocks as they pass through the @xmath7 resonance region .",
    "the feasibility of such a tracking at a water cherenkov detector has been explored in @xcite .",
    "our understanding of the sn explosion mechanism is still unsatisfactory @xcite , which makes it very important to extract as much information about the shock wave as possible . in this paper , we demonstrate how the neutrinos that pass through the shock wave near the @xmath7 resonance carry information about the density profile of the shock wave . in addition to making the @xmath7 resonance",
    "temporarily nonadiabatic , the shock wave also forces the neutrinos to encounter multiple @xmath7 resonances .",
    "the relative phases that the neutrino mass eigenstates gain between two or more of such @xmath7 resonances manifest themselves as oscillations in the neutrino flavor conversion probabilities as a function of the neutrino energy .",

    "such effects were pointed out in the context of solar neutrinos in @xcite and also observed in the numerical studies of supernova neutrinos in @xcite .",
    "we provide an analytical approximation to study these effects , relating them to the the density profile of the medium .",
    "we also provide criteria to decide when decoherence or finite energy resolution of detectors renders these effects unimportant .",
    "if the multiple resonances are semi - adiabatic , the phase effects may be strong and if the oscillations are indeed observed in the neutrino spectra , they can help us infer about the density profile of the shock wave , which in turn can provide us important clues about the shock wave propagation and the sn explosion .",
    "the observability of these effects is dependent on factors like neutrino fluxes at the source , possible coherent development of neutrinos due to neutrino - neutrino interactions , the different density profiles encountered by neutrinos coming from different regions of the neutrinosphere , stochastic fluctuations of density , effective luminosity of the supernova , detector capabilities , et cetera .",

    "comparing figure  [ pbarplot ] and figure  [ analpbarplot ] we see that for @xmath146 rad the approximation is resonably accurate for neutrino energies above @xmath147 mev .",
    "figure  [ pbarlargetheta ] shows the smeared @xmath115 calculated numerically and analytically for @xmath148 rad .",
    "it is clear that the approximation is valid above @xmath149 mev .",
    "the approximation fails at low energies where @xmath115 calculated analytically does not tend to zero . for higher energies , the oscillations due to the phase effect are predicted quite accurately .    in order to explore the observability of the phase effects , we use the parametrization for the primary fluxes given by @xcite : f^0__i= n()()^ , where @xmath150 . for illustration ,",
    "we choose two models of neutrino fluxes , the garching model @xcite that uses the parameters _ = _ |_x =3 ,   e_0 ( ) = 15   , + e_0(|_x ) = 18   ,  _ 0()/_0(|_x ) = 0.8 , and the livermore model @xcite that uses _",

    "0()/_0(|_x ) = 1.6 .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig - flux](a ) the quantity dn_/de _ & = & ( e _ ) f _ + & = & ( e _ ) [ f^0_|_x + |p ( f^0_-f^0_|_x ) ] [ sigma - e ] as a function of the neutrino energy @xmath151 , where we have normalized the spectrum such that the total number of events is @xmath133 .",
    "here we use the differential cross section as computed in @xcite .",
    "the phase effect is most prominent around @xmath152@xmath11 seconds postbounce when the tail t and reverse shock r pass through the @xmath7 resonance and the t - r resonance pair is about @xmath153 km apart .",
    "we expect from ( [ ener - crit ] ) that the extrema in the survival probability will occur at energies separated by about @xmath129@xmath130 mev .",
    "this is clearly visible in figure  [ fig - flux](a ) .",
    "moreover , the positions of the extrema are independent of the primary fluxes",
    ".    however , the spectrum shown in figure  [ fig - flux](a ) is not directly observable : one can only observe the energy spectrum of positrons produced by the inverse beta reaction .",
    "assuming quasielastic scattering , the positron energy is given by @xcite e_e= [ e - positron ] and p_e= , [ e - positron ] where @xmath154 is the angle of scattering , @xmath155 the proton mass , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 .",
    "for @xmath158 mev , we have @xmath159 , so that the positron energy is spread over a range of @xmath160 mev depending on the scattering angle .",
    "given that the successive maxima of the oscillation pattern are separated by only about @xmath21@xmath161 mev in this energy range , the oscillation pattern is significantly smeared out .",
    "a further smearing of the oscillation pattern is caused by the finite energy resolution of the detector .",
    "the energy resolution of a water cherenkov detector is typically @xmath162 and washes off the oscillations completely . for a scintillation detector ,",
    "the resolution is much better , @xmath163 .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig - flux](b ) the spectrum of the observed positron energy @xmath164 after taking ( [ e - positron ] ) and ( [ e - positron ] ) into account and using the energy resolution of a scintillation detector .",
    "it is observed that one or two extrema at high energies ( @xmath165 @xmath166@xmath167 mev ) may still survive for the livermore model where the spectrum extends to higher energies , but their clean identification would require @xmath168 events at a scintillation detector in a single time bin .",
    "figure  [ fig - flux](b ) also shows the positron energy spectrum for @xmath133 events , binned in @xmath169 mev energy intervals , which is approximately the energy resolution of a scintillation detector near @xmath170 mev .",
    "the total number of events expected even at a future 50 kt scintillation detector is @xmath171 for a sn at a distance of @xmath130 kpc @xcite .",
    "even with 1 sec time bins , the number of events in each bin will be @xmath172 .",
    "this is a number too small for our purposes .",
    "thus , the identification of the phase effects seems very unlikely , unless the sn is as close as a kpc .",
    "the density profiles in the shock wave are quite uncertain , and one may expect that some possible profiles give rise to oscillations with larger amplitudes and wavelengths , which would be easier to observe .",
    "the amplitude of oscillations is proportional to the ratio @xmath173 [ see ( [ a - def ] ) and ( [ master - eqn ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , larger amplitudes need a larger ratio @xmath173 whereas larger wavelengths need a sharp tail , i.e. a larger @xmath174 . at the same time",
    ", the adiabaticity parameter at the two resonances has to be @xmath175 for @xmath158 mev",
    ". however , we find that even with such finely tuned density profiles , the improvement in observability is not significant .",
    "when the neutrinos escaping from the core of a core collapse sn pass through the shock wave , they may encounter multiple `` @xmath7 '' resonances corresponding to @xmath176 and @xmath3 , when the shock wave is in the regions with densities around @xmath177@xmath14 g / cc .",
    "we have shown that this necessarily gives rise to oscillations in the neutrino survival probabilities , which we have calculated as a function of energy .",
    "we present an analytical approximation for small mixing angles and show that the oscillations are a significant effect : they can be of the same order as the non - oscillating terms .",
    "the typical values of @xmath3 that gives rise to the oscillation features are in the `` transition region '' of the neutrino mixing parameter space @xcite that is significant in range ( @xmath1 ) but is usually neglected in the sn analysis for the sake of simplicity .    the local maxima and minima in the survival probabilities of @xmath26 or @xmath2 are determined by the relative phase accumulated by the neutrino mass eigenstates between the multiple resonances .",
    "the positions of these extrema depend on the density profile and are independent of the primary neutrino spectra .",
    "if these extrema were identified they would reveal information on the propagation of the shock wave : its location as well as the density variation present around it . since neutrinos are the only particles that can carry information about the shock wave while it is still deep inside the exploding star , it is important to explore the observability of these phase effects .",
    "moreover , the mere identification of these effects in the @xmath2 spectrum would establish the inverted hierarchy and nonzero @xmath3 , which are two of the most important quantities in neutrino phenomenology , and even faint chances of their determination should be explored .",
    "it is interesting that for typical shock wave profiles , oscillations with `` wavelengths '' of @xmath21@xmath161 mev are indeed present in the neutrino survival probabilities in the energy range @xmath165 @xmath178@xmath167 mev .",
    "these wavelengths are tantalizingly close to the resolving power of the neutrino detectors",
    ". however , the inability of the detectors in reconstructing the energy of the incoming neutrino tends to wash out the oscillation pattern . for typical shock wave density profiles ,",
    "the energy resolution of water cherenkov detectors is insufficient to detect the oscillations .",
    "even a scintillation detector with a superior energy resolution will need @xmath168 events in the relevant time bin of @xmath152@xmath11 sec postbounce for identifying one or two extrema in the most optimistic scenario .",
    "therefore , we expect that neglecting the phase effects is a valid practical approximation except under extreme cases",
    ". note that it is still possible to observe other robust signatures of shock wave propagation like the dips in the time spectrum of number of events @xcite or the double dip feature in @xmath179  @xcite .",
    "some of these features survive even in the presence of somewhat extreme stochastic density fluctuations , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the oscillatory effects might contribute additional scatter to these signals but will not spoil the signatures .",
    "we must qualify the above conclusions by stating the effects ignored in our analysis to obtain the present results .",
    "we have assumed a smooth spherically symmetric density profile and ignored anisotropies that are likely to be present @xcite .",
    "this is a justified assumption only as long as the deviations from this assumed profile occur only on transverse distances larger than the size of the neutrinosphere so that the neutrinos in our line of sight do not experience the anisotropy .",
    "we have not included the recently discussed collective effects of coherent flavor development @xcite , which may be important in the inverted hierarchy .",
    "however , the extent and nature of its impact on flavor conversion has not been worked out in detail , which makes it difficult to be included in the present analysis .",
    "similarly , the effects of a realistic spectrum of stochastic fluctuations in the medium density or turbulent convections behind the shock wave are yet to be calculated for sn neutrinos @xcite . we think that with a better understanding of the collective effects and density fluctuations one could include their effect on the realistic observability of the phase effects .",
    "the phase effects pointed out here result from the interference between two or more msw resonances .",
    "this phenomenon is not restricted to the sn alone , but may occur whenever neutrinos pass through nonmonotonic matter densities and the resonances are semiadiabatic .",
    "the technique developed in this paper for treating coherent multiple resonances is applicable to such cases .",
