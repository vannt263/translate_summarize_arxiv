    "the universality of critical exponents is an important and remarkably elegant property of standard second order transitions , which has been explored in great detail through the renormalization group theory ( rgt ) .",
    "the universality hypothesis states that for all systems within a universality class the critical exponents are rigorously identical and do not depend on the microscopic parameters of the model",
    ". however , universality is not strictly universal ; there are known eccentricmodels which are exceptions and violate the universality rule in the sense that their critical exponents vary continuously as functions of a control variable .",
    "the most famous example is the eight vertex model solved exactly by baxter @xcite ; there are other scattered cases , all in dimension two as far as we are aware .    for ising spin glasses ( isgs ) ,",
    "the form of the interaction distribution is a microscopic control parameter .",
    "it has been assumed tacitly or explicitly that the members of the isg family of transitions obey standard universality rules , following the generally accepted statement that empirically , one finds that all systems in nature belong to one of a comparatively small number of universality classes@xcite .",
    "however , we know of no formal proof that universality must hold in isgs ; it was found thirty years ago that the @xmath3-expansion for the critical exponents @xcite in isgs is not predictive since the first few orders have a non - convergent behavior and higher orders are not known .",
    "this can be taken as an indication that a fundamentally different theoretical approach is required for spin glass transitions .",
    "indeed `` classical tools of rg analysis are not suitable for spin glasses '' @xcite .",
    "isg transition simulations are much more demanding numerically than are those on , say , pure ferromagnet transitions with no interaction disorder .",
    "the traditional approach in isgs has been to study the temperature and size dependence of observables in the near - transition region and to estimate the critical temperature and exponents through finite size scaling relations after taking means over large numbers of samples .",
    "finite size corrections to scaling should be allowed for explicitly which can be delicate . from numerical data , claims of universality",
    "have been made repeatedly for isgs @xcite even though the estimates of the critical exponents are very sensitive to the precise value of the critical temperature and have varied over the years ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a tabulation of historic estimates ) .",
    "we have estimated the critical exponents of the bimodal isg in dimension @xmath0 using complementary strategies .",
    "first we use the standard finite size crossing points of the binder cumulant and other phenomenological couplings to obtain estimates for the critical temperature @xmath4 through finite size scaling @xcite .",
    "we also register the size dependence of the peaks of thermodynamic derivatives which give independent estimates for @xmath5 and for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we finally measure the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic limit ( thl ) isg susceptibility @xmath6 and second moment correlation length @xmath7 over a wide temperature range . using the scaling variable and scaling expressions appropriate for isgs as cited below @xcite together with the optimal @xmath5 from the above measurements , we estimate the critical exponents and the confluent corrections to scaling @xcite from data taken over almost the entire paramagnetic temperature range .    the numerical data on different isgs in dimension @xmath0 show conclusively that the critical exponents depend on the form of the interaction distribution .",
    "it is relevant that it has been shown experimentally that in heisenberg spin glasses the critical exponents depend on the strength of the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is as usual @xmath8 with the near neighbor symmetric distributions normalized to @xmath9 .",
    "the ising spins live on simple hyper - cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we have studied bimodal ( @xmath10 ) , gaussian , and laplacian distributions in @xmath0d . here",
    "we will discuss the bimodal isg and will compare with published measurements on two other @xmath0d isgs @xcite .",
    "the simulations were carried out using the exchange monte - carlo method for equilibration , on @xmath11 individual samples at each size .",
    "data were registered after equilibration for the energy @xmath12 , correlation length @xmath13 , for the spin overlap moments @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and for the link overlap @xmath18 moments .",
    "in addition the correlations between the energy and certain observables @xmath19 were also registered so that thermodynamic derivatives could be evaluated using the relation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the energy @xcite .",
    "bootstrap analyses of the errors in the derivatives as well as in the observables themselves were carried out .    for the present analysis",
    "we have observed the behavior of various `` phenomenological couplings '' , not only the familiar binder cumulant and correlation length ratio @xmath22 but also other observables showing critical behavior such as the kurtosis of the spin overlap distribution , the kurtosis of the absolute spin overlap distribution , and the variance and kurtosis of the link overlap distribution",
    ". only part of these data are reported here .",
    "near criticality in a ferromagnet the heights of the peaks of the thermodynamic derivative of many observables @xmath23 scale for large @xmath24 as @xcite @xmath25 and the temperature location of the derivative peak @xmath26 scales as @xmath27 the observables used for @xmath28 @xcite can be for instance the binder cumulant @xmath29 , the logarithm of the finite size susceptibility @xmath30 , or the logarithm of the absolute value of the spin overlap @xmath31 .",
    "each of these data sets can give independent estimates of @xmath2 and @xmath4 without any initial knowledge of either parameter .",
    "for the present analysis we note that both the minimum of the inverse derivative @xmath32 and the temperature location difference @xmath33 are proportional to @xmath34 to leading order .",
    "hence @xmath32 plotted against @xmath35 with @xmath24 as an implicit variable must tend linearly to an intercept @xmath36 at @xmath37 for large @xmath24 .",
    "all @xmath32 against @xmath35 plots should extrapolate consistently to the true @xmath4 .    turning to spin glasses , for isgs with symmetric interaction distributions and a non - zero @xmath4",
    "a general natural scaling variable is @xmath38 ( @xmath39 is also suitable for the bimodal case ) @xcite .    in the isg context",
    "@xmath40 replaces @xmath41 in the thermodynamic derivative scaling rules but otherwise the same methodology can be used as in the ferromagnet .",
    "the thermodynamic derivative analysis , which as far as we are aware has not been used previously in spin glasses , provides reliable and precise estimates for @xmath42 .",
    "these @xmath42 estimates are consistent with those from the traditional crossing point approach ; which method has the least sensitivity to finite size corrections depends on the individual system .",
    "the thl sg susceptibility @xmath43 including the leading nonanalytic confluent correction term @xcite can be written @xmath44 where @xmath1 is the critical exponent and @xmath45 the wegner non - analytic correction exponent , both of which are characteristic of a universality class . following a protocol well - established in ferromagnets @xcite",
    "one can define a temperature dependent effective thl exponent @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 tends to the critical @xmath1 as @xmath48 and to @xmath49 as @xmath50 in simple [ hyper]-cubic lattices .",
    "as long as samples of finite size @xmath24 are in the thl regime , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and other observables are independent of @xmath24 . working in the thl has a number of advantages : the temperatures studied are higher than the critical temperature so equilibration is facilitated , the sample to sample variations are automatically much weaker than at criticality , and there are no finite size scaling corrections to take into account although the confluent correction terms must be allowed for . in ferromagnets the thl susceptibility and correlation length data can be fitted accurately over the entire paramagnetic temperature range @xcite by including just one further effective correction term @xmath53 beyond the leading non - analytic term , which bundles together all the higher order correction terms .",
    "we use this approximation also in the isgs .",
    "hence @xmath54    a very effective method for analysing the thl susceptibility data is to plot @xmath55 against @xmath56 . with the two correction terms",
    "the expression used to fit the thl regime data is : @xmath57 the critical intercept @xmath58 occurs when @xmath59 , and the initial slope starting at the intercept is @xmath60 .",
    "the analogous natural scaling expression for the isg second moment correlation length @xmath61 is @xcite @xmath62 with a temperature dependent effective exponent defined as @xmath63 .",
    "the reason for the factor @xmath64 arises from the generic form of the isg @xmath61 high temperature series @xcite .",
    "the @xmath65 limit in isgs in simple hyper - cubic lattices of dimension @xmath66 is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the kurtosis of the interaction distribution .",
    "the derivative corresponding to eq .   takes the form @xmath69 with the same @xmath70 and @xmath45 as for @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath58 intercept is again @xmath72 , with an initial slope at the intercept equal to @xmath73 .",

    "our present binder cumulant data up to @xmath79 show very similar results , figure 1 . in this figure",
    "crossing points for the largest @xmath24 can be seen to cluster around @xmath102 , which provides a lower limit on @xmath42 .",

    "@xcite is low .",
