    "<S> _    </S>",
    "<S> according to current observations it is believed that the universe is now experiencing a period of recent positive acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> a natural question to ask is how generic is this acceleration , and therefore the associated dark energy , in the context of string and m  theory compactifications . in particular , there has been a considerable amount of recent work showing that , provided the volume of the compact space is time  dependent , </S>",
    "<S> periods of acceleration can indeed occur [ 3][17 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these findings evaded the previous `` no  go theorem '' @xcite , which did not allow for such time  dependence .    </S>",
    "<S> let us then consider a four  dimensional frw spacetime , together with an internal space of dimension @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall assume that only the volume of the internal space depends on the time coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> then , both in flux and hyperbolic compactifications , the four - dimensional action reduces to @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a positive constant . </S>",
    "<S> this effective theory is thus defined by a family of potentials parametrized by a constant @xmath5 . for hyperbolic compactifications , with an internal space of dimension </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 , this constant is given by @xmath7 and therefore lies in the range @xmath8 on the other hand , for flux compactifications one has @xmath9 regardless of initial conditions , the late  time evolution of these cosmologies , including the particular solutions studied recently , can be analysed with generality following the work of halliwell @xcite .    in this note , we shall identify , for the above supergravity compactifications , every possible asymptotic behaviour for the cosmic acceleration . the exact solution for flat universes </S>",
    "<S> was found , for any constant @xmath5 , by townsend @xcite . for both compactifications , we shall see that an accelerating epoch is necessarily transient , which would lead to an eternally accelerating universe without a future event horizon @xcite , is not included in the above compactifications . ] . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , for closed cosmologies , an accelerating phase must be transient . in the case of open cosmologies </S>",
    "<S> , we shall see that one always has late  time periods of acceleration and/or deceleration which decay with proper time as a power law .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start by reviewing halliwell s work , which translates the above problem to that of finding the solutions of a two  dimensional dynamical system . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by introducing the lapse function @xmath10 in the frw metric : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 depending on whether @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> setting @xmath17 and denoting the derivatives with respect to @xmath18 by dots , the friedmann equation becomes @xmath19 therefore the hyperbola @xmath20 divides the regions where @xmath21 is positive or negative . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the equations of motion reduce to the following dynamical system @xmath22 which has fixed points in the @xmath23plane ( neglecting the ones obtained by @xmath24 , which correspond to a contracting universe ) @xmath25 note that @xmath26 is always on the @xmath27 hyperbola . </S>",
    "<S> the attractor solution is @xmath26 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 otherwise . for @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> the point @xmath26 no longer exists .    </S>",
    "<S> now that we wrote the basic equations derived by halliwell , let us analyse the behaviour of the acceleration . to check </S>",
    "<S> if the corresponding cosmological solution is accelerating , we must check the positivity of the second derivative of the scale factor @xmath31 with respect to proper time @xmath32 where in the last step we used the equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> a positive acceleration is therefore equivalent to @xmath33 it is convenient to define the quantity @xmath34 by the equation of state for the scalar pressure @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> then , it is straightforward to show that the equations of motion lead to @xmath36 hence vertical lines on the @xmath23plane are lines of constant @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath38axis corresponds to @xmath39 , and the stripe where the universe accelerates corresponds to @xmath40 . as a function of @xmath41 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 is a growing function whose maximum is 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 0,0)(0,0 )    let us analyse the various trajectories in the @xmath23plane drawn in @xcite , and check whether they correspond to an accelerating universe . </S>",
    "<S> consider first the case of a closed universe . </S>",
    "<S> then , for @xmath42 there are trajectories in the phase plane which exhibit late  time acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> these trajectories flow towards the attractor @xmath43 which is located inside the acceleration stripe . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in @xcite , the scale factor has the power law behaviour @xmath44 and therefore the geometry has a future event horizon . on the other hand , for @xmath45 , which includes m  theory compactifications </S>",
    "<S> , there is a runaway behaviour with a decelerating universe , as can be seen in both figures 1 and 2 .    </S>",
    "<S> next , let us consider the fixed point @xmath26 , by concentrating , for the moment , on a flat universe with @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the class of solutions for a flat universe and arbitrary constant @xmath5 were found explicitly in @xcite . for @xmath46 , the point </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 is always an attractor , _ if we restrict to the _ @xmath27 _ </S>",
    "<S> hyperbola_. for @xmath47 , and therefore not for hyperbolic nor flux compactifications , the fixed point has @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the asymptotic solution is _ accelerating_. the case @xmath49 has a solution which accelerates and a solution which decelerates , depending if one starts from @xmath50 . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the accelerating solution does not have a future event horizon @xcite . within the range @xmath51 , which includes hyperbolic compactifications , the asymptotic solution is always decelerating ( figure [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , following @xcite , consider the trajectory ( a ) in figure [ fig1 ] , starting with large negative @xmath52 ( the field rolling up the potential ) . then , as @xmath53 becomes less then @xmath54 , we enter into a period of _ transient acceleration _ </S>",
    "<S> , followed again by a period of deceleration . </S>",
    "<S> finally , for @xmath30 , the @xmath27 trajectory ( a ) of figure [ fig2 ] , associated to flux compactifications , has a runaway behaviour , going through a period of transient acceleration .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 0,0)(0,0 )    let us move to the case of @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , where there is always an attractor at @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath29 is on the boundary of the region @xmath57 of acceleration , because at late times curvature dominates and one has linear expansion . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , these geometries do not have a future event horizon . the behaviour of the trajectories converging to @xmath26 changes at @xmath58 ( see @xcite for details ) . for @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> the trajectories are as in figure [ fig1 ] , whereas for @xmath60 the trajectories spiral to @xmath29 , like in figure [ fig2 ] . whenever @xmath59 , we can arrange initial conditions to have a period of transient acceleration similar to the @xmath27 case , as in the trajectory ( b ) in figure [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> other initial conditions will give a cosmology with a late time decaying acceleration , as for the trajectory ( c ) in the same figure . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath60 ( so , in particular , for all flux compactifications and for hyperbolic compactifications with @xmath61 ) , _ independently of initial conditions _ , we have a cyclic behaviour , with the acceleration oscillating around zero , with decreasing magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now clear that , for flat universes , a positive acceleration is _ always _ transient for _ both _ type of compactifications and one _ always _ has late  time deceleration . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast with open cosmologies , where _ both _ compactifications can give , at late times , periods of positive acceleration . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we shall study the behaviour of this late  time acceleration as a function of proper time .    </S>",
    "<S> let us then analyse the dynamical system near the attractor @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> after the standard linearization , one obtains the asymptotic behaviour @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the eigenvectors , and the eigenvalues are @xmath66 it is then straightforward to determine the proper time as a function of the time coordinate @xmath18 which , to leading order , is @xmath67 integrating equation ( [ linear ] ) and replacing in the general formula for the acceleration ( [ accel ] ) , one obtains the following asymptotic behaviour as a function of proper time @xmath68 where @xmath69 are integration constants .    </S>",
    "<S> consider first @xmath70 , corresponding to real eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> then the asymptotic behaviour for the acceleration reads @xmath71 on the other hand , for @xmath60 the eigenvalues are complex , thus giving rise to the oscillatory behaviour @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a phase . </S>",
    "<S> hence the acceleration will oscillate with an amplitude decreasing as @xmath74 , falling faster then in the case with @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the periods of acceleration and deceleration become longer as @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , if the acceleration vanishes at @xmath76 , then the next zero will occur after an interval @xmath77 thus periods of acceleration or deceleration grow linearly with cosmological time .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is tempting to define an effective matter and an effective cosmological constant associated with the scalar field by writing the deceleration and total density parameters as @xmath78 where primes denote derivatives with respect to proper time @xmath79 . inverting this system of equations we conclude that lines of constant @xmath80 are straight lines and lines of constant @xmath81 are ellipses , respectively given by @xmath82 at the attractor , @xmath62 , one has @xmath83 while at the saddle point , @xmath43 </S>",
    "<S> , one has @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the present acceleration of the universe derived from supernovae measurements of the @xmath85 parameter , can then be generically reproduced by trajectories on their way to the attractor . for example , trajectories like ( b ) in both figures go through an accelerating phase compatible with supernovae observations . also , it is clear that the system evolves towards an attractor where @xmath86 , therefore it would not be surprising that both components were of the same order today . </S>",
    "<S> this fact could explain the cosmic coincidence problem if the late time dynamics of the universe is determined by the compactification scalar . </S>",
    "<S> notice that , usually one thinks of the quintessence field as the source of dark energy only . here one is naively assuming that both dark matter and dark energy are generated by the quintessence field alone . while this interpretation seems to resolve the coincidence problem it raises serious problems for small scale structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , even if it is possible to have acceptable growth of baryonic perturbations , it turns out that the perturbations on the newtonian potential caused by the coupling of the scalar field to gravity do not grow , and therefore can not explain the mysterious dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we could study the evolution of this model coupled to additional matter . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it would be interesting to investigate if it evolves to a period of eternal acceleration with @xmath86 . </S>"
