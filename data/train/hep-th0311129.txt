    "between the first and second superstring revolutions , there was another burst of excitement , based on the technology of large @xmath1 matrix techniques .",
    "this `` matrix revolution '' has generally been regarded as having delivered much less than it seemed to promise .",
    "occasionally it is still referred to as having taught us a few of the early lessons about important features of string theory beyond perturbation theory ( see _ e.g. , _",
    "ref.@xcite ) , but further than that not much else has been said . it has been suggested by some over recent years that there are more useful lessons to be learned from that period , some of which may be relevant to current issues ( see _ e.g. , _",
    "ref.@xcite ) . admittedly , most of the suggestions had not been bolstered by computational evidence in a definite framework of ideas , and so were largely ignored .",
    "this year has seen a number of key papers@xcite which have supplied both framework and computations renewing interest in connecting the old results to new ideas , and thereby refurbishing an old laboratory for the testing of more modern ideas . in short , one ",
    "dimensional @xmath2 matrix models have been identified as the world ",
    "volume theory of  @xmath1 of the d  branes the appropriate continuum theory@xcite ( liouville coupled to a scalar ) , thereby recasting the large  @xmath1 physics as another tractable example of holography since the string theory is two  dimensional . furthermore , since the matrix model potential is recognised as the open string world ",
    "volume tachyon potential , we have a powerful new setting within which to study tachyon condensation@xcite , the understanding of which is of considerable importance . for these and other reasons ( see below )",
    "it is very clear that the double scaled technology has delivered on many of its promises and may well continue to do so as we explore it with fresh eyes .",
    "one of the biggest promises on which the double  scaled matrix model technology is alleged to not have delivered was that of supplying a complete and well  defined non  perturbative definition of the stringy physics .",
    "this assertion has in fact been known to be untrue , but by only a few ( despite having been present in the literature for a dozen years ) .",
    "it is extremely simple and natural identification of a picture with two symmetric components .",
    "matrix models which appeared later ( in the @xmath3 matrix model context ) with such doubled distributions@xcite of eigenvalues , have recently been reinterpreted as type  0 string theories@xcite . ] to define string theories with exactly the same genus by genus expansion as that provided by the original matrix models@xcite , but with a perfectly well defined and unique non ",
    "perturbative completion@xcite .",
    "it is also often remarked that it is only recently that we have achieved understanding of dirichlet open string sectors ( _ i.e. , _ d  branes ) in the context of those early string models .",
    "actually , perfectly sensible perturbative definitions were derived at an early stage@xcite , and the non  perturbative definition of these closed string theories mentioned in the previous paragraph was extended in ref.@xcite to achieve the inclusion of world sheets with dirichlet boundaries .",
    "this was used to show@xcite that the double  scaled unitary matrix models@xcite were not supplying the physics of some mysterious continuum theory ( another misconception with surprising longevity ) , but were just a rewriting of string theories , albeit with the inclusion of open string sectors .",
    "it is worth noting that despite the excitement and remarkable successes of the second revolution , which gave us so much insight into strings beyond perturbation theory , the bulk of the non  perturbative information which we have is still phrased very much in terms of perturbative string theory or field theory , by invoking strong",
    " weak coupling dualities .",
    "it is still difficult to supply definitions of physics at intermediate values of the coupling , without restricting attention to elementary considerations such as the spectra of bps states .",
    "the @xmath4 physics supplied by the double  scaled matrix model techniques years ago was in terms of families of non  linear differential equations called `` string equations '' in the old literature@xcite .",
    "the solutions of these equations obtained by asymptotic expansion correspond to weak string coupling perturbation theory , but they encode physics at arbitrary values of the coupling in the full solutions .",
    "these systems may well contain useful lessons about string theory at intermediate coupling which may help address issues of current concern .",
    "the reason for recalling the various facts listed above is so that we may exhibit them as components of a possible series of further valuable lessons which the matrix revolution taught us which were missed the first time around .",
    "perhaps it was necessary for the field to depart and return to the results from another direction , enriched with the lessons learned elsewhere , such as the importance of branes in getting access to strongly coupled physics , the significance of large @xmath1 in other stringy contexts such as holography , _ etc_.",
    "quite a few of these features are evident in the double scaled matrix models , but of course they are hard to see because there is not much room for physics to happen in these low dimensional scenarios .",
    "a recent paper@xcite has gathered considerable evidence for a picture in which many of the aforementioned facts fit together in a way which is highly instructive , and quite exciting .",
    "first , the string theories for which the well  defined non  perturbative formulation was provided are not the simple bosonic string theories but in fact the type  0 string theories ( although there are key similarities ; see later ) .",
    "specifically , the type 0b string theories of the @xmath5 superconformal minimal models coupled to super  liouville theory are captured by unitary one  matrix models ( or equivalently two  cut hermitian one  matrix models ) , while the type 0a theories of the same worldsheet models are captured by the complex one  matrix models ( or symmetric two  cut hermitian one  matrix models , or equivalently the sector of even perturbations of the unitary one  matrix models ) .",
    "the physics of these models is captured by string equations which supply unique and sensible non  perturbative data . in this new context , some of the new lessons we might learn from matrix models immediately begin to become apparent . for example ,",
    "the interpretation of the inclusion of the open string sectors already supplied in the earlier work@xcite becomes extended to include ramond ",
    "ramond flux as well , and the non  perturbative physics supplied by the string equations connects the two , since they arise as different asymptotic expansions of the same equation .",
    "in fact , such an elegant non  perturbative encapsulation of geometric transitions@xcite between open string ( d  branes ) and closed string ( fluxes ) physics is highly sought after in the modern context , and for at least that reason it is worth revisiting the old models , now dressed in their new clothes .      the purpose of the work reported on in this paper is to begin to define and explore more models in this new context , and study new and more complicated examples .",
    "as stated above , the work of refs.@xcite in defining non  perturbative string physics for all the @xmath6 conformal models coupled to liouville theory , extended further in ref.@xcite to naturally include open string sectors in the non  perturbative discussion while also interpreting doubled unitary scaled matrix models in these terms , was recently recast in terms of type 0a string theories ( with maps to type  0b in ( at least ) one case , using the result of ref.@xcite ) , where the relevant conformal models are the @xmath5 superconformal series , where @xmath7 . in particular , for type  0a , the string equation is that of refs.@xcite : @xmath8and @xmath9 is a parameter related to the closed string coupling , since it is the renormalised @xmath10 which survives the double scaling limit of the ( @xmath2 ) matrix model .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 -z\\ ,    \\label{rdef}\\ ] ] where the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , are couplings to the gravitationally dressed conformal field theory operators , @xmath14 , in the theory and the @xmath15 $ ] are polynomials in @xmath16 and its derivatives with respect to  @xmath17 , given below in equation  ( [ eq : gelfanddikki ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath16 is the two point function of the operator @xmath18 , which couples to @xmath19 , and so the free energy can be obtained by integrating @xmath16 , as the precise relation is : @xmath20 in ref.@xcite , it was shown that the large positive  @xmath17 expansion of a solution to equation  ( [ nonperturbative ] ) has an interpretation in terms of string world  sheet perturbation theory in the presence of @xmath21 branes , since @xmath21 appears raised to the power @xmath22 , where @xmath22 is the number of boundaries in the genus expansion . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the perturbation expansion is identical to that of the string equations of refs.@xcite which have the ill  defined non  perturbative physics for @xmath24 even .",
    "indeed , those equations are simply contained in the above equation as the case @xmath25 .",
    "for example , in the case of pure gravity , the @xmath26 model , we have : @xmath27 on integrating to get the free energy , it is seen that the natural dimensionless topological expansion parameter ( closed string coupling ) is @xmath28 . worldsheets with @xmath29",
    "handles and  @xmath22 boundaries come with a factor @xmath30 , and so @xmath21 naturally has an interpretation as the number ( in some units does not matter too much .",
    "it is enough to know that @xmath21 simply counts the number of d  branes , or half r ",
    "r flux insertions ( see later ) , in some units .",
    "all that is important here is its exponent in various equations , which help organise perturbation theory .",
    "this was why @xmath21 was called the `` open string coupling '' in ref.@xcite . ] ) of d  branes to which each boundary couples ) , with the boundary conditions such that their expansion is of the form  ( [ eq : expand ] ) , for a specific value of @xmath21 . ] .    that the equation  ( [ nonperturbative ] ) , for @xmath23 , has a sensible large negative  @xmath17 expansion , in contrast to the case @xmath31 , was key to the realisation of refs.@xcite that there is sensible non  perturbative formulation",
    "in fact , for arbitrary @xmath21 , the @xmath32 expansion has a sensible world ",
    "sheet interpretation , and the regions of intermediate  @xmath17 connect smoothly through @xmath33 to each other in a unique , this equation can be mapped using the miura map to the family of solutions to the string equations of the double  scaled unitary matrix models with even potentials .",
    "these are known to be unique from analytic studies .",
    "see also the previous footnote . ] way , supplying a complete non  perturbative definition of the physics .",
    "for example , for @xmath26 again , we have :    @xmath34    in the interpretation in terms of open strings , it is strange that there are no world sheets with an odd number of boundaries , and no interpretation was given in the earlier work for the missing orders , although a connection with the `` topological '' solution @xmath35 was suggested , since for all @xmath24 this is the leading term in all the large negative @xmath17 expansions .",
    "in the new setting of ref.@xcite , this large negative  @xmath17 expansion has a new interpretation : the string theory is closed and @xmath21 represents an even number of insertions due to the presence of @xmath21 units of r  r flux . since the two expansions one with d  branes and one with r ",
    "r flux are connected smoothly through the strong coupling region by the full string equation  ( [ nonperturbative ] ) , this gives a complete and elegant example of geometric transitions between descriptions with d  branes and those with r ",
    "r fluxes .",
    "there is a large family of natural generalisations of the string equation ( [ nonperturbative ] ) .",
    "these were presented in refs.@xcite , where the context was the full family of @xmath36 conformal minimal models coupled to liouville theory .",
    "the principal techniques used there were the underlying structure of the generalised kdv hierarchy which organises the physics . the inclusion of open string sectors was derived in ref.@xcite , by exploiting further the underlying integrable system , and appealing to the elegant organisation of the key structures in terms of integrable systems and the modes of a twisted boson .",
    "lest fears arise that a loss of contact with a matrix model and hence a worldsheet description may have resulted from paying too much attention to the integrable system to derive these generalisations , it should be noted that the open  closed string equation of ref.@xcite for the case @xmath37 was reproduced in an explicit two  matrix model computation in ref.@xcite .    in this paper",
    "these more general equations , presented in section  [ proposal ] , will be explored somewhat further than they were when originally presented , in the light of the new setting .",
    "we will make a number of observations about the physics they contain .",
    "part of the goal is to make the natural suggestion that they are the equations defining the type  0a system of the full @xmath36 superconformal minimal models coupled to super  liouville theory . for this to work ,",
    "it is evident that there must be a striking coincidence between the spectrum of dressed operators in the superconformal theory and those in the bosonic theory , for which the string equations were originally presented .",
    "this coincidence was already made explicit for the @xmath6 ( bosonic ) _ vs. _",
    "the @xmath38 ( supersymmetric ) case presented in ref.@xcite , and it is natural to conjecture that it is more generally true . in section  [ superconformal ] we show how it works in general .    in section  [ examples ] , we study a specific example , which is in fact to be interpreted as the tricritical ising model not with the ordinary gravitational dressing , but _ super_gravitationally dressed .",
    "we observe some features of the perturbative expansions and anticipate that the full non  perturbative solution is well defined .",
    "our observations strongly suggest that there is a rich family of geometrical transitions between d  branes and r  r fluxes , all of which the model has a complete non  perturbative description .",
    "there also seem to be possible solutions with a novel interpretation in terms of r  r flux in _ both _",
    "weak coupling regimes for which d  branes can be switched on in one weak coupling region by switching on a further operator .",
    "this operator induces a flow to an open string generalisation of what is the ordinary ising model in the bosonic context .",
    "we note that more work is needed to study the non  perturbative solutions of the string equations , since our computations have been centered around exploring the possible weak coupling limits of the string equation , and anticipating that at least a subset of the behaviours that we find are connected to each other by the non  perturbative physics contained in the equation .",
    "such further study to explore the fate of the solutions we have found is likely to be highly instructive and fruitful .    finally , the non  trivial numbers appearing in the one  loop partition function of the @xmath39 series of models are noted , since they are clues to confirming the identity of the models .",
    "unfortunately , we can not conclude anything about them until the corresponding numbers for the type 0b model are known , since the contributions from the two sets of spin structures must be added to compare with known results . formulating the @xmath36 0b models is beyond the scope of this paper , and so a full comparison is left to the future .",
    "there is an interesting feature however , extending what was observed for the @xmath40 case long ago@xcite , and interpreted in the present context in ref.@xcite : a large class of solutions with flux interpretation in the large @xmath17 expansion all have vanishing contribution on the sphere , and the value of the torus contribution is universal to all models in the 3series .",
    "this is likely to be true in the general @xmath36 string models .",
    "the purely closed string @xmath36 generalisations of the @xmath6 string equation  ( [ nonperturbative ] ) were presented in ref.@xcite , although the fullest discussion of properties and structure of the entire family of equations and their associated matrix models can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "a summary follows , and then the open string generalisation , derived in ref.@xcite will be stated .      to appreciate the structure of the equations , it is most useful to have in mind the structure of the generalised kdv hierarchies .",
    "the reader not interested in this structure can simply skip to the bottom of this subsection .",
    "the @xmath41th kdv hierarchy can be formulated in terms of a @xmath41th order differential operator @xmath42 , of the form : @xmath43 where there are @xmath44 functions @xmath45 , and @xmath46 here denotes ( @xmath9 times ) the derivative with respect to  @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath47s are normalisation constants .",
    "the hierarchy is a family of flow equations : @xmath48\\ ,    \\label{eq : qflows}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is constructed using the elegant technology of pseudo ",
    "differential operators@xcite .",
    "briefly , @xmath50 is an infinite series : @xmath51 d^{-1-j}\\ ,    \\label{eq : qfrac}\\ ] ] where the operation @xmath52 is defined by : @xmath53 where @xmath54 means @xmath55 differentiated @xmath56 times with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "the functions @xmath57 in the above are polynomials in the @xmath45 and their  @xmath17derivatives . with the above definition ,",
    "is easy to raise @xmath58 to the desired integer power @xmath59 , and then @xmath60 denotes the truncation of the result by discarding terms containing odd powers of @xmath46 .    of course , if @xmath61 mod @xmath41 , the flows defined in equation  ( [ eq : qdiffy ] ) are trivial , and so we only consider the case when @xmath41 does not divide @xmath59 .",
    "hence , we write @xmath62 , where @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . the generalised times @xmath65",
    "will be written @xmath66 .    just for orientation ,",
    "the more familiar kdv hierarchy is the case @xmath40 , for which there is just one index to vary , @xmath24 , which gives the @xmath24th flow for the function @xmath67 : @xmath68 where the @xmath69 are given in equation  ( [ eq : gelfanddikki ] ) .",
    "so in the more general case of @xmath70 , one can think of  @xmath71 as parameterising @xmath72 different towers of flows , where @xmath24 denotes where one is on the tower .    after some work , one can write the general flow equations directly as differential equations for the @xmath45 : @xmath73 where there s no sum on @xmath56 intended , and the @xmath47 are constants .",
    "the derivative operators @xmath74 arise from the `` bi  hamiltonian '' poisson bracket structure of the the kdv systems , and define recursion relations between the differential polynomials @xmath75 _ via _ the second relation in equation  ( [ eq : qdiffytwo ] ) .",
    "these polynomials in the @xmath76 and their derivatives are generalisations of the famous gelfand ",
    "dikii@xcite polynomials which appear in the usual kdv system , where @xmath77 , and : @xmath78 and the derivative operators in this @xmath40 case are : @xmath79 so that @xmath80 . in general , the @xmath75 are fully determined by acting with the @xmath74 operators , once the seed constants are fixed . in our normalisation , @xmath81 .",
    "an explicit example of the case @xmath39 showing how the more general structure works , will be given shortly .    with all of the structures in place , it is quite simple to state the general form of the string equations .",
    "the following set of @xmath72 equations : @xmath82 where @xmath83 may be combined into a single equation by multiplying on the left by @xmath84 and summing .",
    "the result is in fact a total derivative .",
    "the equation resulting from integrating once and setting the constant to zero is the string equation case was formulated in terms of integrable hierarchies in ref.@xcite , can be written as the first integrals of the @xmath72 equations @xmath85 .",
    "the @xmath86 arise as integration constants , and so in our conventions those string equations are just @xmath87 .",
    "the non  perturbative problems of these equations are well  known . in the present formulation ,",
    "these equations are taken as only perturbatively true , the correct non  perturbative physics being supplied by equation  ( [ eq : stringequationfinal ] ) . ] : @xmath88    this elegant compact form may not be totally illuminating to the reader , so it is worthwhile to see how the @xmath40 string equation  ( [ nonperturbative ] ) arises",
    ". it can be done by eye , looking at @xmath89 defined in  ( [ eq : derivatives ] ) , with @xmath90 given in  ( [ rdef ] ) , one gets a total derivative , @xmath91 , which can be integrated once to give equation  ( [ nonperturbative ] ) . to match onto closed string perturbation theory , which is equivalent to @xmath25 ,",
    "the constant must be set to zero .      as might be guessed from an examination of the @xmath40 equations already stated , the generalisation to include some number , @xmath21 , of d ",
    "branes is straightforward .",
    "one must simply keep non ",
    "zero the integration constant at the last step of the previous subsection !",
    "so the general string equation , which includes world sheet boundaries in the @xmath92 perturbative expansion , is : @xmath93    the reader might find the above open string formulation a little brief , and thus find it hard to believe that it can be so simple to include d  brane sectors .",
    "there is in fact an elegant underlying structure to all of this which is being suppressed .",
    "first , from a direct matrix model computation , for the @xmath6 case the perturbative open string physics can be explicitly recovered by including a term @xmath94 in the one  matrix model of the @xmath95 matrix @xmath96 , as was carried out originally in ref.@xcite .",
    "the result is in fact : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the resolvent of the differential operator @xmath77 , defined as a formal inverse@xcite : @xmath99 in fact , the differential polynomials are simply coefficients in the expansion in the spectral parameter @xmath100 : @xmath101}{\\sigma^{k+\\frac{1}{2}}}\\ ,    \\label{eq : expandr}\\ ] ] and the resolvent itself satisfies a differential equation@xcite:@xmath102 which is in fact the first integral of the equation @xmath103 , and the integration constant is set by the normalisation of the @xmath104 . henceforth , we will set the spectral parameter @xmath100 to zero has considerable significance in this context , as it couples to a boundary operator .",
    "its effects are interesting@xcite , but we shall not explore them here . ] .",
    "so one can recover the full perturbation theory of solutions of equation  ( [ eq : openperturb ] ) by simply expanding the resolvent to the desired order in equation  ( [ eq : resolventdiffy ] ) .",
    "the non  perturbative physics comes from the full equation , obtained simply by solving equation  ( [ eq : openperturb ] ) for the resolvent and substituting into equation  ( [ eq : resolventdiffy ] ) .",
    "the result is of course our equation  ( [ nonperturbative ] ) , and can in fact be derived directly in an appropriately tuned complex matrix model or two  cut hermitian matrix model .",
    "the general structure was recognised in ref.@xcite and exploited to derive the full open string generalisation above",
    ". briefly explained , the relevant resolvent defines a family of `` jet coefficients '' , @xmath105 which are like @xmath72 generalisations of the single resolvent @xmath98 from before@xcite .",
    "there is a resolvent equation which is simply the first integral of @xmath106 , where the integration constant is in fact  @xmath107 in the normalisation we chose earlier .",
    "the open string generalisation of perturbation theory is simply @xmath108 , and the full non  perturbative physics follows again by using the larger equation after substituting for the resolvent , which is what we wrote in equation  ( [ eq : stringequationfinalfinal ] ) .",
    "much more about the structure of the equations can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "note also that an explicit two  matrix model realisation of an example of this more general formulation was derived explicitly in ref.@xcite .",
    "the proposal is simple .",
    "the string equations presented above are to be taken as a definition of the type 0a string theory in less than two dimensions , in a particular family of backgrounds .",
    "in particular the backgrounds are the @xmath36 superconformal minimal models , and the `` non  critical '' stringy physics is realised by coupling them to super  liouville theory .",
    "the liouville coupling is done through the lowest dimension operator in the theory , with coupling given by  @xmath17 . in the large positive  @xmath17 perturbative world  sheet expansion , there will be boundaries , and @xmath21 represents the number of background d  branes in the model .",
    "it is expected that large negative  @xmath17 will give a closed string expansion with insertions of @xmath21 units of r  r flux .",
    "the string equations have smooth ( and probably unique in general ) solutions which connect these asymptotic behaviours to each other through the non  perturbative region of small  @xmath17 .",
    "the bulk operators in the theory are readily identified in the @xmath41kdv formalism .",
    "one picks a particular theory by picking @xmath109 and @xmath110 such that @xmath111 and for this choice , set @xmath112 all higher @xmath113 are set to zero .",
    "all the lower ones will be couplings to operators .",
    "in particular , the family of @xmath72 operators @xmath114 are very natural in the theory , since @xmath115 is the coupling to the lowest dimension operator , and its cousins @xmath116 have an interpretation as a family of generalised fields such as the magnetic field ( see below ) .",
    "we shall study some examples below .",
    "the evidence for the case @xmath117 was already presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "this proposal extends that work further to all of the superconformal minimal models in a natural way , and it will certainly be interesting to study the role ( in this new context ) of the rich structures which determine the theory s internal organisation , such as the generalised @xmath41kdv flows , the @xmath118algebra of constraints , the language of twisted bosons , _",
    "in proposing that the non  perturbative string physics found in the string equation  ( [ nonperturbative ] ) actually pertains to the type  0a string theory , the operators of the bosonic string theory ( the @xmath6 conformal minimal models coupled to gravity ) had to be mapped onto the operator content of the @xmath38 superconformal minimal models , dressed with gravity .",
    "this was carried out in ref.@xcite .",
    "this is in itself an interesting fact , and if the proposal of this paper is to be believed , we must show that this is the case more generally since there is the danger that the correspondence stops with that sub  series .",
    "first , a brief reminder of the bosonic case is in order .",
    "( a review is given in ref.@xcite , for example . )",
    "consider the @xmath36 theory .",
    "it has central charge given by @xmath119 the bare operators are labelled by two integers , @xmath59 and @xmath120 , satisfying @xmath121 , @xmath122 , with @xmath123 , and shall be denoted @xmath124 .",
    "their dimensions in ordinary conformal field theory ( `` bare dimensions '' ) are : @xmath125 after coupling to gravity , the operator is dressed by the liouville field @xmath126 according to @xmath127 and conformal invariance determines the dressing to be : @xmath128 it turns out that the physics of the operators which arise from the doubled scaled approach is as follows : in unitary models ( @xmath129 ) , the liouville coupling is through the cosmological constant , which couples to the area while more generally , it is to the smallest dimension operator in the theory . from the above ,",
    "this is when @xmath130 , and so the liouville dressing of this operator is @xmath131 .",
    "the dimension which we really care about for the operator @xmath132 is its liouville scaling relative to the smallest dimension operator .",
    "this is : @xmath133    turning to the superconformal @xmath36 series , the operators are labelled in the same way as before .",
    "however , there are two sectors : if @xmath134 is even the operator is from the ns sector while it is from the r sector otherwise .",
    "the central charge is : @xmath135 and the bare weights of operators are : @xmath136 the liouville weights are @xmath137 note that the r sector operator with vanishing @xmath138 is in fact the r ground state , with the familiar weight @xmath139 . in identifying the lowest dimension operator for the next step ,",
    "it is important to distinguish between the two sectors , and to note the restrictions on the allowed @xmath36 .",
    "the point is that @xmath140 , and @xmath141 and @xmath41 are either both odd or both even . in the odd case",
    ", they must be coprime , while in the even case @xmath142 and @xmath143 must be coprime .",
    "so the lowest dimension operator in the case when they are even comes from the ns sector , with @xmath144 .",
    "this was the case identified in ref.@xcite , whence they further specialised to the case @xmath145 , and recovered the same spectrum as the @xmath6 bosonic minimal models .",
    "the general formula for even @xmath36 for the relative liouville weight of operator @xmath146 is : @xmath147 from which , after cancelling various factors of two , seeing that @xmath148 only , gives the familiar result for the scaling of the operator @xmath149 coupling to @xmath150 in the @xmath24th model : @xmath151 the formula of equation  ( [ eq : superliouvilledimension1 ] ) stands for all the even cases , and it should be clear that there will always be factors of two cancelling on the top and bottom lines to allow an embedding of the bosonic operator spectrum  ( [ eq : liouvilledimension ] ) into the supersymmetric one .",
    "there remains the case of odd @xmath36 . here",
    "the lowest dimension operator is in fact from the r sector , and we see that @xmath131 . therefore the relative liouville weight of operator @xmath132 is : @xmath152 there are no cancellations of factors of 2 required here , and we see that this has exactly the same form as the generic bosonic formula  ( [ eq : liouvilledimension ] ) .",
    "this is an interesting and fortuitous fact which gives weight to the main proposal of this paper .    in what follows",
    ", we shall focus on a particular set of examples to check our understanding , and the precise content of the proposal .",
    "we are now ready to unpack a particular example and play with it .",

    "the content of the @xmath84 will be determined by which model is chosen .",

    "we start with the ( 3,4 ) since it is a familiar example , and it will help us check a crucial normalisation we will need later . the basic model has fixed @xmath165 and all other higher @xmath166 , and : @xmath167 if this were a viable model in its own right ( it is not in this context ) , we can check the scalings of the operator content by working directly at the level of the sphere ( tree level ) .",

    "the numbers in equation  ( [ eq : operatorscalings ] ) are indeed the dressed dimensions relative to the cosmological constant @xmath173 in the model .",

    "these numbers are irrelevant .",
    "the operator dimensions will be recomputed in the next subsection once the model is subsumed into the ( 3,5 ) model , which in the context of the superconformal series , is indeed the unitary model .",
    "next , we check a normalisation .",
    "the basic equations in perturbation theory , for the case @xmath23 , can be chosen to be @xmath174 , where : @xmath175 on the sphere , we have : @xmath176 and we may solve the second equation , and substitute into the first , to get @xmath177 the second polynomial equation can solved for @xmath178 , and then using this the first equation then yields @xmath179 .",
    "a simple solution arises when @xmath180 , for which it is seen that @xmath181 .",
    "this is appropriate , since @xmath182 is actually the magnetic field , and @xmath183 is the response to it , _",
    "i.e. , _ the magnetisation .    staying in the sector where @xmath181 and @xmath180 , and keeping @xmath23 , we get ( writing @xmath184 ) : @xmath185 ( where the last equation is an identity ) , and the vanishing of @xmath186 will yield perturbation theory for the function @xmath55 . after a few lines of algebra , the first few terms of the solution are : @xmath187 and so if we use equation  ( [ partfun ] ) , we reproduce the standard result that the torus partition function for the gravitating ising model is : @xmath188 this sets our normalisation for the model of interest in the next subsection .",
    "let us now work with @xmath189 to see what we might learn .",
    "the expansion above in equation  ( [ eq : perturb ] ) can be taken for either large positive  @xmath17 or negative  @xmath17 .",
    "interestingly , switching on @xmath21 breaks this symmetry , in that the large positive  @xmath17 expansion picks up terms linear in @xmath21 which are imaginary .",
    "so if we wish for @xmath55 to be real , and to smoothly connect to non  zero @xmath21 ( which seems reasonable ) then we are forced to pick the expansion as being for the negative  @xmath17 direction .",
    "the fact that the other choice does not smoothly connect onto non ",
    "zero  @xmath21 , while keeping @xmath55 real , may well be an earmark of a branch of new physics to @xmath190 , which is interesting , but we shall keep a definite choice of @xmath21 in order to compare each member of the 3series with each other . ] , but we will not explore that here .",
    "so , for @xmath189 , expanding in large negative  @xmath17 , we find @xmath191 while expanding for large positive  @xmath17 we find @xmath192 based on our experience with these equations , it is entirely reasonable to expect the string equation supplies the means to uniquely connect these two expansions smoothly through the non  perturbative region",
    ". it would be interesting to prove this analytically .",
    "integrating up twice to get the free energy , we see that the natural dimensionless world  sheet expansion parameter ( _ i.e. _ , the string coupling ) is @xmath193 .",
    "the topological expansion is very interesting . for large negative  @xmath17",
    ", we see that the first two terms in equation  ( [ eq : perturbmore ] ) represent the sphere and the disc respectively , while the next term contains the torus and the cylinder , and the next the holey torus , and so forth .",
    "the interpretation is that there are @xmath21 d  branes ( in some units ) , and there is an appropriate factor of @xmath194 for every boundary , accompanying the usual @xmath195 in string perturbation theory .    for large positive  @xmath17 ,",
    "things are rather different . with the same identification of expansion parameters as before",
    ", the presence of only even powers of @xmath21 presents a puzzle .",
    "the first non  vanishing physics is at the level of the torus and the cylinder , but then nothing until higher orders .",
    "these orders are the four  torus ( sphere with four handles ) , holey sphere ( it has six holes ) , _ etc .",
    "_ there are no terms like the disc , _ etc .",
    ", _ with odd numbers of boundaries .",
    "a simpler explanation , following ref.@xcite , is to not attribute a brane interpretation to this regime at all . rather , there are all the correct surfaces present for purely _ closed string _ perturbation theory , and",
    "instead , each power of @xmath196 represents an insertion of r  r flux .",
    "it would be interesting to examine an underlying matrix model ( such as the one in ref.@xcite ) further to add evidence for this claim . in the present case",
    ", we shall take this as the simplest interpretation .",
    "we could invoke other more complicated reasons for the vanishing of the surfaces with odd numbers of boundaries , but none have occurred to us which seem as natural as this one .    with this interpretation ,",
    "it is tempting to declare that we have found our first new example of a transition between closed string physics with fluxes and physics with d  branes present . bear in mind however that this ( 3,4 ) model is not a complete 0a model in its own right , since it is not a member of the superconformal series ( since 3 is odd but 4 is not )",
    ". however , it will be ( with appropriate coupling to an operator ) naturally embedded within the prototype complete 0a model we study in the next subsection , and so the remarks here about r  r flux , and the possibility of a non  perturbative geometric transition from flux to d  branes , will become an honest interpretation within that context .",
    "it is quite amusing that the first complete non ",
    "trivial model of interest to us is the tricritical ising model .",
    "this model is fascinating in its own right since in ordinary conformal field theory ( _ i.e. , _ no dressing ) it is the unique minimal model which is both conformal and superconformal  @xcite . in the bosonic context",
    ", it appears gravitationally dressed as the @xmath197 model . in this context , it is supergravitationally dressed and is the @xmath162 .",
    "the model has fixed @xmath198 and all other higher @xmath166 , and : @xmath199 to compute the operator dimensions , we note that in addition to the sphere level behaviour listed in equation  ( [ eq : spherelevel ] ) , we have : @xmath200 from the second equation we see that @xmath201 and @xmath202 , and so a little algebra gives the  @xmath17 scaling of all of the operators : @xmath203 note that @xmath204 and can be absorbed into a boundary operator .",
    "the operator scalings in equation  ( [ eq : operatorscalingsmore ] ) are precisely the scalings required by the formula  ( [ eq : superliouvilledimension2 ] ) ( derived with continuum methods ) to work , and the model is to be interpreted as a type  0a background , as per our proposal .    again , let us study perturbation theory with @xmath23 first .",
    "then we have a choice @xmath205 where now ( switching off @xmath206 ) : @xmath207 and so on the sphere we have the equations @xmath208 we may solve the first equation and substitute into the second to get : @xmath209 again , this system can be used to solve for @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "notice that this time ( in contrast to the case in the previous section ) we can choose @xmath180 and still retain non ",
    "zero @xmath183 .",
    "in fact , after a bit of algebra , we find for this choice , writing ( @xmath67 ) : @xmath210 let us now go beyond tree level to uncover a bit more physics , staying with @xmath23 for now . more algebra yields from our equations the next few levels of closed string perturbation theory : @xmath211 we can readily integrate the above result for @xmath16 twice to get the expression for the free energy , using equation  ( [ partfun ] ) .",
    "we see that the dimensionless world sheet expansion parameter ( string coupling ) is @xmath212 .",
    "now we switch @xmath21 back on , and solve the full string equation  ( [ eq : thestringequation ] ) perturbatively , starting with the same sphere level solutions .",
    "we find that the next non  vanishing level of perturbation theory is of order @xmath9 , and denoting the contributions to @xmath16 and @xmath183 at this order by @xmath213 and @xmath214 , respectively , we have the following equation for them : @xmath215 this dreadful equation can be simplified by realising that the solution for @xmath216 must reduce to zero at @xmath23 , and similarly for @xmath217 , since we would like to match onto closed string perturbation theory in this limit .",
    "one way that we can achieve this is by setting the square root to zero , since @xmath218 for this choice , and we remark in passing that other choices of @xmath216 will given two other branches of solutions",
    ". it would be interesting to explore these further . in proceeding to develop the non ",
    "zero @xmath21 perturbation theory , we note that ( rather like happened in the case of the previous subsection ) in order to have real solutions for @xmath16 and @xmath183 , we must take our expansion as pertaining to negative @xmath17 . carrying on with the choice in equation  ( [ eq : mustsolve ] ) that makes the square root",
    "vanish , after going on to the next few levels of perturbation theory we have : @xmath219 it is very curious that there is no contribution to @xmath16 of surfaces with boundary beyond the disc , although this is not the case for @xmath183 .",
    "similarly interesting is the choice to make @xmath216 vanish in equation  ( [ eq : mustsolve ] ) . in that case , it is the @xmath183 perturbative series which fails to be afflicted by @xmath21 at higher orders , while the @xmath16 perturbative series has contributions from all orders .",
    "however , it is clear that for generic choices of @xmath216 , we will have contributions to the physics at all orders in perturbation theory from all types of surfaces with and without boundaries .",
    "the reader should not be concerned that these choices for @xmath216 correspond to non  perturbative ambiguities in the physics .",
    "there is nothing about the properties of the string equation which suggest that this is the case , as far as we know .",
    "it must be recalled that there are also constraints that can not be specified in the perturbative analysis , such as the nature of the asymptotic expansion in the other large @xmath17 regime .",
    "generically , we expect that the requirement of fixing to perturbation theory in _ both _ the @xmath92 and the @xmath32 regimes will fix things uniquely .",
    "the present analysis is simply a demonstration of the perturbative possibilities available to us .    turning to a wider range of choices ,",
    "note that we can start at sphere level with vanishing @xmath184 .",
    "this is now physics that the equations @xmath205 can not handle , but the full string equation can , since the sphere level condition is : @xmath220 where @xmath221 the choice @xmath222 leaves : @xmath223 we can choose @xmath182 to vanish , as a special case , resulting in vanishing @xmath183 on the sphere .",
    "there are no doubt solutions for which @xmath183 is non  zero beyond tree level , but we wo nt pursue those here .    it is also interesting to consider the case of @xmath183 vanishing to all orders and beyond . in such a case",
    ", we have in the string equation the functions : @xmath224    expanding , we have for example in the @xmath92 limit : @xmath225 the physics of this regime is again expected to be connected by smooth non  perturbative physics through the strong coupling region to other perturbative physics , such as that given in equation  ( [ eq : tricriticalperturbed ] ) , and it would be interesting to pursue this further .",
    "notice that we can also have a solution for which @xmath226 and @xmath181 at tree level , in the large negative @xmath17 regime , which is again something which is allowed by the sphere condition  ( [ eq : spherecondition ] ) of the full string equation , and not the restriction to the solutions of @xmath205 .",
    "the first few terms of the asymptotic expansion of the solution of our string equation are : @xmath227    examining this expression and the previous one , tentatively associating each power of @xmath21 with a boundary , we have the sphere , torus and cylinder from the first two terms , but no disc .",
    "the next term contains the double torus , torus with two holes and sphere with four holes . missing are any surfaces with an odd number of holes .",
    "following on from what we have already stated about the expansions observed in the previous subsections , ( and based on examples in ref.@xcite ) , this is highly suggestive of a r  r flux interpretation instead of boundaries .",
    "so tentatively , there are no world sheet boundaries in the expansion but fluxes : one insertion for every power of @xmath196 , however this needs to be explored more .",
    "it is our conjecture that it will _ always _ be the case that only even powers of @xmath21 appear in solutions for which the behaviour on the sphere is a solution of equation  ( [ eq : spherecondition ] ) but not @xmath205 , and further , that it extends to all of the string equations for the @xmath36 series",
    ". a proof of this would be useful to construct .",
    "so we have a number of possibilities , depending upon the boundary conditions .",
    "we remind the reader that the overall situation is necessarily more complicated that for the study of the equation  ( [ nonperturbative ] ) , for the @xmath38 series because there are two functions to solve for , @xmath228 and @xmath183 , in addition to a number of couplings , @xmath182 and @xmath229 .",
    "it is clear that we can have solutions which have d  branes in the large negative  @xmath17 regime , but only fluxes for positive  @xmath17 .",
    "these are new fully non ",
    "perturbative examples of geometrical transitions .",
    "we may well also have solutions which have fluxes in _ both _ regime , which is certainly novel",
    ". these would arise if we choose sphere behaviour in both asymptotic regions which are allowed by the tree level condition  ( [ eq : spherecondition ] ) of the full string equation , but not @xmath205 .",
    "we do not know if this is consistent non ",
    "perturbatively , but certainly seems like a possibility at the level of our current analysis .    for either the former or the latter case",
    ", we can always expect transition phenomena for another reason : we must not forget that we have switched off a number of operators in the theory .",
    "recall from the explorations in the last subsection of the ( 3,4 ) model , that the large negative  @xmath17 region contained branes , while the large positive  @xmath17 direction contained only fluxes .",
    "there was a geometric transition as one went through the strong coupling regime .",
    "if we switch on the operator @xmath230 by turning on @xmath229 it will mix the physics we have seen here with the physics of the ( 3,4 ) model .",
    "so in fact , we have a new way of generating transition phenomena , by turning on @xmath230 , even if we started with a solution in the ( 3,5 ) model with no transition .",
    "let us see how this must work , continuing to keep @xmath181 and @xmath231 .",
    "we must now solve the string equation with : @xmath232 unfortunately , this becomes a rather difficult problem to proceed with analytically . already at the sphere , after working to linear order in @xmath229 , we see that the physics is controlled by the solution to this equation : @xmath233 the next step will be to solve this for @xmath16 at linear order in @xmath229 and then proceed .",
    "it is not clear if the mixing with new world sheets with boundaries will ever be seen in the linear approximation however , or even to any order in perturbation in @xmath229 , so this approach may be doomed .",
    "however , we do know that ultimately , since @xmath229 is a good operator in the theory there will be a flow to the behaviour of the previous subsection givign a new handle with which to switch on transition phenomena .",
    "it is also possible that switching on the other coupling which we have set to zero ( @xmath182 ) , together with the function @xmath234 for large positive  @xmath17 , may also allow for odd powers of @xmath21 to appear , giving us even more directions in which we can move to find transitions .",
    "it is also likely that there is an interesting geometrical description of this moduli space of directions giving a nicer setting in which some of these transition phenomena might have a powerful description .",
    "the presence of an underlying supersymmetric model makes this seem worth seeking .",
    "further study of this @xmath162 example ought to be carried out .",
    "we ve looked at a range of perturbative solutions , and showed that examples of the interesting physics which we seek abound , but further analysis of how these asymptotes connect to each other non  perturbatively ought to be performed by studying the string equation further .",
    "finally , we note two more interesting pieces of data , the one  loop contribution to the partition function",
    ". this should give useful universal data which can be compared to the continuum theory .",
    "for large @xmath235 regime the torus contribution is : @xmath236 while in the @xmath237 regime it is : @xmath238    the latter result is particularly interesting .",
    "first of all , it appears to be a universal contribution yielded by all solutions in the @xmath153 series which begin with sphere contributions not satisfying @xmath239 , but satisfying  ( [ eq : spherecondition ] ) .",
    "the expected full result@xcite : @xmath240 would seem to require that the 0b contribution in this regime is non  vanishing .",
    "( interestingly , it vanishes exactly for the @xmath38 series@xcite , but this had better not happen here since the type  0b contribution is needed to restore the @xmath141 dependence of the formula .",
    "if our proposal is correct , this number serves as a prediction for the type  0b definition ( yet to be presented ) , in order to make contact with the continuum results .",
    "here , we shall be brief , since we have made the key technical observations along the way .",
    "it is hoped that it is apparent to the reader that the old double scaled large @xmath1 matrix technology , although failing to tell us anything directly about higher dimensional string theories , may still supply useful laboratories within which to study a range of phenomena of current interest .",
    "this should be definitely appreciated once it is realised that there are very many well  defined non  perturbative formulations of the physics .",
    "these models remain the only real examples we have in string theory where certain questions can be asked and answered at arbitrary values of the coupling . admittedly , given that the string theories which can be formulated with these methods do not admit a lot of room for a wide variety of physics , the range of questions is rather smaller than for higher dimensional string theory , but there is still scope for lessons to be learned .    here , we have proposed a natural formulation of the type 0a string in @xmath241 backgrounds , the superconformal minimal models coupled to supergravity , extending the work of ref.@xcite .",
    "this work is all based on non  perturbative formulations of string theory , including both closed and open sectors , which have existed in the literature for over a decade now , but have been recast in a new role as type  0a theories .",
    "the first non  trivial new model which we studied in this paper , the ( supergravitationally dressed ) tricritical ising model as it turns out , already supplied us with new physics which should be studied further , and presumably there is more to be found in other examples too .",
    "there is a lot more to learn about these models , and no doubt the remarkably rich underlying structures ( integrable hierarchies , w  algebra constraints and so forth ) may play an important role in this new context .",
