    "rich clusters of galaxies  families of hundreds of galaxies held together by the gravitational potential of the cluster  are the most massive bound objects known .",
    "cluster masses can be directly and reliably determined using three independent methods : 1 ) the motion ( velocity dispersion ) of galaxies within clusters reflect the dynamical cluster mass , within a given radius , assuming the clusters are in hydrostatic equilibrium ( 1 - 3 ) ; 2 ) the temperature of the hot intracluster gas , like the galaxy motion , traces the cluster mass ( 4 - 6 ) ; and 3 ) gravitational lensing distortions of background galaxies can be used to directly measure the intervening cluster mass that causes the distortions ( 7 - 10 ) .",
    "all three independent methods yield consistent cluster masses ( typically within radii of @xmath0 1 mpc @xmath2 light years ) , indicating that we can reliably determine cluster masses within the observed scatter ( @xmath3 30% ) .",
    "let us begin with the simplest argument for a low density universe .",
    "the masses of rich clusters of galaxies range from @xmath4 radius of the cluster center ( where @xmath5 denotes hubble s constant , representing the expansion rate of the universe ) .",
    "when normalized by the cluster luminosity , a median mass - to - light ratio of @xmath6 in solar units ( @xmath7 ) is observed for rich clusters , independent of the cluster luminosity , velocity dispersion , or other parameters ( 3,11 ) .",
    "( @xmath8 is the total luminosity of the cluster in the blue band , corrected for internal and galactic absorption . )",
    "when integrated over the entire observed luminosity density of the universe , this mass - to - light ratio yields a mass density of @xmath9 , or a mass density ratio of @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the critical density needed to close the universe ) .",
    "the inferred density assumes that all galaxies exhibit the same high m/@xmath8 ratio as clusters , and that mass follows light on large scales .",
    "thus , even if all galaxies have as much mass per unit luminosity as do massive clusters , the total mass of the universe is only @xmath0 20% of the critical density .",
    "if one insists on esthetic grounds that the universe has a critical density ( @xmath12 ) , then most of the mass of the universe has to be unassociated with galaxies ( i.e. , with light ) . on large scales ( @xmath13 )",
    "the mass has to reside in `` voids '' where there is no light .",
    "this would imply , for @xmath12 , a large bias in the distribution of mass versus light , with mass distributed considerably more diffusely than light .",
    "is there a strong bias in the universe , with most of the dark matter residing on large scales , well beyond galaxies and clusters ?",
    "a recent analysis of the mass - to - light ratio of galaxies , groups , and clusters by bahcall , lubin and dorman ( 11 ) suggests that there is not a large bias .",
    "the study shows that the m/@xmath8 ratio of galaxies increases with scale up to radii of @xmath14 mpc , due to very large dark halos around galaxies ( see also 12,13 ) .",
    "the m / l ratio , however , appears to flatten and remain approximately constant for groups and rich clusters from scales of @xmath0 0.2 to at least @xmath15 and possibly even beyond ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the flattening occurs at @xmath16 , corresponding to @xmath17 .",
    "( an @xmath18 is needed for a critical density universe , @xmath12 . )",
    "this observation contradicts the classical belief that the relative amount of dark matter increases continuously with scale , possibly reaching @xmath12 on large scales .",
    "the available data suggest that most of the dark matter may be associated with very large dark halos of galaxies and that clusters do not contain a substantial amount of additional dark matter , other than that associated with ( or torn - off from ) the galaxy halos , plus the hot intracluster gas .",
    "this flattening of m / l with scale , if confirmed by further larger - scale observations , suggests that the relative amount of dark matter does not increase significantly with scale above @xmath19 mpc . in that case ,",
    "the mass density of the universe is low , @xmath20 , with no significant bias ( i.e. , mass approximately following light on large scales ) .",
    "clusters contain many baryons , observed as gas and stars . within @xmath21 mpc of a rich cluster ,",
    "the x - ray emitting gas contributes @xmath22 % of the cluster virial mass ( 1416 ) .",
    "stars contribute another @xmath23 4% .",
    "the baryon fraction observed in clusters is thus : @xmath24 standard big bang nucleosynthesis limits the baryon density of the universe to ( 1718 ) : @xmath25 these facts suggest that the baryon fraction observed in rich clusters ( eq.1 ) exceeds that of an @xmath26 universe ( @xmath27 ; eq .",
    "2 ) by a factor of @xmath23 3 ( for h @xmath28 ) . since detailed hydrodynamic simulations ( 14,16 )",
    "show that baryons do not segregate into rich clusters , the above results imply that either the mean density of the universe is lower than the critical density by a factor of @xmath23 3 , or that the baryon density is much larger than predicted by nucleosynthesis .",
    "the observed high baryonic mass fraction in clusters ( eq.1 ) , combined with the nucleosynthesis limit ( eq.2 ) , suggest ( for h @xmath29 ) @xmath30",
    "in a recent study by bahcall , fan and cen ( 19,20 ) we show that the evolution of the number density of clusters as a function of cosmic time ( or redshift ) provides a powerful constraint on @xmath31 ( 19 - 22 ) .",
    "the growth of high - mass clusters from initial gaussian fluctuations depends strongly on the cosmological parameters @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the root - mean - square mass fluctuation on @xmath34 mpc scale ; 2327 ) . in low - density models ,",
    "density fluctuations evolve and freeze out at early times , thus producing only relatively little evolution at recent times ( @xmath35 ) . in an @xmath26 universe , the fluctuations start growing more recently thereby producing strong evolution in recent times ; a large increase in the abundance of massive clusters is expected from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "the evolution is so strong in @xmath12 models that finding even a few coma - like clusters at @xmath38 over @xmath39 of sky contradicts an @xmath12 model where only @xmath40 such clusters would be expected ( when normalized to the observed present - day cluster abundance ) .",
    "the evolution of the number density of coma - like clusters was recently determined from observations and compared with cosmological simulations ( 1921 ) .",
    "the data show only a slow evolution of the cluster abundance to @xmath41 , with @xmath42 times more clusters observed at these redshifts than expected for @xmath12 .",
    "the results yield @xmath43 .",
    "the evolutionary effects increase with cluster mass and with redshift . the existence of the three most massive clusters observed so far at @xmath44 places the strongest constraint yet on @xmath31 and @xmath33 . these clusters ( ms0016 + 016 at @xmath45 , ms0451 + 03 at @xmath46 , and ms105403 at @xmath47 , from the extended medium sensitivity survey , emss , 28 )",
    "are nearly twice as massive as the coma cluster , and have reliably measured masses ( including gravitational lensing masses , temperatures , and velocity dispersions ; 3,9,2932 ) .",
    "these clusters posses the highest masses ( @xmath48 within 1.5 @xmath49 comoving mpc radius ) , the highest velocity dispersions ( @xmath50 ) , and the highest temperatures ( @xmath51 kev ) in the @xmath52 emss survey . the existence of these three massive distant clusters , even just the existence of the single observed cluster at @xmath47 , rules out gaussian @xmath12 models for which only @xmath53 clusters are expected instead of the 1 cluster observed ( or @xmath54 clusters expected instead of the 3 observed ) .",
    "( see bahcall & fan ( 29 ) ) .    in figure 2",
    "we compare the observed versus expected evolution of the number density of such massive clusters .",
    "the expected evolution is based on the press - schechter ( 23 ) formalism that describes the growth of structure in a hierarchical universe with standard initial gaussian density fluctuations ; this formalism agrees well with direct numerical cosmological simulations ( 20,26 ) .",
    "the expected evolution is shown for different @xmath31 values ( each with the appropriate normalization @xmath33 that satisfies the observed present - day cluster abundance , @xmath55 ; 26,33 ) .",
    "the model curves range from @xmath56 ) at the top of the figure ( flattest , nearly no evolution ) to @xmath57 ) at the bottom ( steepest , strongest evolution ) .",
    "the difference between high and low @xmath31 models is dramatic for these high mass clusters : @xmath12 models predict @xmath58 times less clusters at @xmath59 than do @xmath60 models .",
    "the large magnitude of the effect is due to the fact that these are very massive clusters , on the exponential tail of the cluster mass function ; they are rare events and the evolution of their number density depends exponentially on their `` rarity '' , i.e. , depends exponentially on @xmath61 ( 20,23,29 ) .",
    "the number of clusters observed at @xmath62 is consistent with @xmath60 , and is highly inconsistent with the @xmath63 clusters expected if @xmath12 . the data exhibits only a slow , relatively flat evolution ; this is expected only in low @xmath31 models .",
    "@xmath12 models have a @xmath63 probability of producing the one observed cluster at @xmath62 , and , independently , a @xmath64 probability of producing the two observed clusters at @xmath65 .",
    "these results rule out @xmath12 gaussian models at a very high confidence level .",
    "the results are similar for models with or without a cosmological constant .",
    "the data provide powerful constraints on @xmath31 and @xmath33 : @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( 68% confidence level ) ( 29 ) .",
    "the high @xmath33 value for the mean mass fluctuations indicates a nearly unbiased universe , with mass approximately tracing light on large scales ( since the galaxy fluctuations , which represent the light , exhibit a similar value of @xmath33(galaxy ) @xmath68 ) .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the suggested flattening of the observed m / l ratio on large scales ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    in figure 3",
    "we summarize the four independent @xmath31 ( @xmath33 ) constraints obtained from the cluster results discussed above : 1 ) the present - day cluster abundance constraint ( 26 , 33 ) @xmath69 ; 2 ) the high - redshift ( @xmath70 ) cluster abundance constraint ( 29 ) ; [ the overlap of the @xmath37 and @xmath71 abundance constraints of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) yields the cluster evolution constraint discussed above ] ; 3 ) the @xmath31 derived from the high baryon fraction in clusters ; and 4 ) the @xmath31 obtained from cluster masses .",
