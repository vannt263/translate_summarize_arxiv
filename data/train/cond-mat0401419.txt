    "nucleation and growth of mono - disperse nanostructures is a challenging field both for theoretical modeling and practical applications due to their new magnetic , electric and catalytic properties .",
    "growth of regular islands has been achieved in various systems such as metal aggregates supported on insulator surfaces @xcite , hetero - epitaxial growth of semiconductors including self - assembled quantum dots @xcite , and metal on metals systems @xcite . although nucleation and growth models have been extensively developed and compared with experiments in the case of homogeneous substrates , growth on heterogeneous substrate has been considered only recently .",
    "the hetero - epitaxial growth of highly strain islands is still very difficult to modelize , but simple systems have been considered such as nucleation on substrates containing point - defects traps @xcite or spatial ordering of islands grown on patterned substrates @xcite . the use of spontaneously nanostructured substrates as templates for organized growth is a promising way as it allows to grow not only regular nanostructures but also to grow high density lattice of regular nanostructures over macroscopic scales .",
    "this opens up the way for new studies of both individual and collective physical properties by means of standard averaging technics .",
    "metal on metal systems provide model systems for ordered growth on well - defined nano - patterned substrates @xcite .",
    "experimentally , this phenomena has been successfully applied to the formation of nanostructures but very few studies are dealing with the atomistic mechanisms leading to the organization and the quantitative determination of the associated energies .",
    "the precise determination of the atomistic mechanisms for a given substrate should allow to make some prediction to get an ordered growth with various deposited material and to find out the conditions ( flux , temperature ) for the narrowest size distribution . indeed the use of a nanostructured template is not a sufficient condition to get an ordered growth .",
    "for example , the reason why fe , co , ni , cu @xcite display an ordered growth on au(111 ) at room temperature whereas ag , al @xcite do not is still under debate .    in this paper",
    "we study the nucleation and growth of co nanodots on a au(111 ) reconstructed , vicinal substrate .",
    "this system has been shown recently @xcite to display an improved long - range order and a narrower size distribution than on au(111 ) . using a variable temperature scanning tunneling microscope ( vt - stm ) , we have studied the evolution of the growth morphology with temperature . with a statistical analysis of the stm images combined with kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulation and molecular dynamics ( md ) calculation , we determine the mechanisms at the origin of the organization of co nanodots on au(788 ) .",
    "this result opens the way to make quantitative predictions about the ordered growth of other materials on au(788 ) like fe or ni .",

    "it was shown in earlier studies that this surface can be used as a template for the growth of cobalt nano - dots @xcite as the crossing of a discommensuration line and a step edge acts as a favored nucleation site .",
    "our au(788 ) sample is a au single crystal cut by spark erosion to produce a 4 mm diameter and 2 mm thick disk .",
    "it was prepared in a uhv chamber ( base pressure @xmath3 mbar ) using repeated argon sputtering ( @xmath4 mbar ar pressure , @xmath5 kev energy ) followed by 850 k annealing cycles .",

    "the uncertainty on the absolute cobalt coverage is about @xmath11 .",
    "deposition was achieved directly under a vt - stm . for temperatures below room temperature ,",
    "stm images were taken at the growth temperature in order to be sure that no change could be introduced by the annealing . for deposition temperatures above room temperature ,",
    "stm images were taken at room temperature as cooling down the sample does not change the result ( clusters density , size distribution and clusters morphology ) .",
    "in order to determine the atomistic mechanisms at the origin of the ordered growth of co on au(788 ) , we have performed stm images for different substrate temperatures and co coverage . in a first part , we present and describe the stm images for temperature ranging from 35 k to 430 k. in a second part",

    "we wonder which atomistic mechanisms are at the origin of the ordered growth on au(788 ) and explain such a large temperature range .",
    "what are the pertinent parameters , which explains the temperature range for an ordered growth regime ?    for low temperatures , the mean free path of adatoms on a surface is lower than the mean distance between favored sites ( or the density of cluster is higher than the density of favored sites as it can be seen on fig .",

    "the adatoms can not be influenced by the periodic patterning of the surface as its period is wider than the region explored by adatoms .",

    "a characteristic of such a regime is that the critical clusters density is constant with temperature and equals the density of favored sites . indeed",
    "the diffusion length of the adatoms is limited by the presence of the favored sites .",

    "we then need to consider the evolution of the population of trapped adatoms @xmath43 and trapped stable islands @xmath44 .",

    "the most important point is that in this temperature range , the order is still present on the surface ( see fig . [",
    "kmcfig]c ) but the number of defect ( empty favored site , coalesced neighbor dots ... ) is more important than in the previous regime .",
    "this fact is particularly evident for the simulation at @xmath92 k , i.e. the bimodal size distribution is pretty well reproduced .",
    "the origin of this size distribution is the weakness of the bonds between the co atoms . as a consequence ,",
    "the critical size ( biggest unstable cluster ) of a cluster on a favored site is 2 .",
    "this explains why the growth of the dots in the favored sites is strongly inhomogeneous : some dots grow faster an lead to big clusters when they coaless with the neighboring cluster .",
    "one may wonder why in the @xmath89 k - @xmath90 k temperature range there is an organization whereas in the simulation including only the exchange mechanism with the same parameters we do not find any organization in the same temperature range .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the evolution of the cluster density is not simply explained by the sum of two different mechanisms but a combination . above @xmath89",
    "k , even if the favored sites can not stabilize adatoms with just the favored adsorption mechanism , the residence time of the adatoms is increased in these sites , with respect to the normal sites . as a consequence , the exchange probability is increased in the same way .",
    "this interplay between the two mechanisms is a key which explains the large temperature range for the organized growth .",
    "indeed place exchange mechanism is not favorable for the organized growth due to the large place exchange barrier but provide a strong energy gain in the favored site . on the opposite ,",
    "the favored adsorption mechanism lead to the organization but the low energy gain can not maintain an organization in a large temperature range .",

    "we now discuss which relation are required for these parameters in order to obtain an ordered growth for a large temperature range .",
    "first of all , the width of the ordered growth regime is determined by @xmath22 for the temperature @xmath25 and by @xmath96 , the energy barrier for the removal process of the place exchange ( when a au adatom exchanges with a co inserted atom ) , for the temperature @xmath97 . a key to obtain a regular organization on the whole temperature range is the interplay between the two mechanisms . as a consequence , the removal process for the adsorption mechanism should not occur before the place exchange is possible . from an energetic point of view",
    "this means that the gain of the favored adsorption mechanism @xmath93 must be higher or of the same order than the place exchange barrier @xmath98 .",
    "however the absolute value of these energies is not a key as the temperature at which the interplay occurs is not very important . in the case of co on au(788 ) @xmath93 is just of the order of @xmath98 .",
    "that is why we only have a rough organization in the 170 k - 300 k temperature range .",
    "as the interplay between the two mechanisms is not perfect , we can see a small `` accident '' in the evolution of the critical clusters density with temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ kmc_glob ] ) .",
    "the ordered growth of co nanodots on the au(788 ) surface is proved to be due to the presence of favored site where two microscopic mechanisms occur : a favored adsorption and a place exchange mechanism .",
    "the combination of these two mechanisms leads to the organization of the co nanodots for a temperature that ranges from @xmath99 k to @xmath90 k. a rectangular array of mono - disperse cobalt nanodots is then yielded with a great regularity .",
    "these experimental results open the way to study the physical properties of nano - sized ferromagnetic particules with integrating technics like magneto - optical kerr effect .",
    "with such a mono - disperse array of nanodots integrating technics can be used to deduce the physical properties of a single particle .    the numerical simulations , in spite of many approximations ,",
    "provide us an accurate insight about the fundamental mechanisms of the growth of co / au(788 ) .",
    "a mechanism at the origin of the organized growth is a place exchange . for that kind of mechanism ,",
    "the removal process is very hard as it corresponds to an atomic rearrangement in the surface layer .",
    "it was found to be helped by a favored adsorption mechanism .",
    "indeed , due to the energy gain of the adatoms in these sites , the place - exchange probability is increased because the mean residence time of atoms is large .",
