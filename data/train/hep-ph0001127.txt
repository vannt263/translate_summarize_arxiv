    "the production of lepton pairs in hadron collisions @xmath3 proceeds through an intermediate virtual photon via @xmath4 , and the subsequent leptonic decay of the virtual photon .",
    "traditionally , interest in this drell - yan process has concentrated on lepton pairs with large mass @xmath0 which justifies the application of perturbative qcd and allows for the extraction of the antiquark density in hadrons @xcite .",
    "prompt photon production @xmath5 can be calculated in perturbative qcd if the transverse momentum @xmath1 of the photon is sufficiently large . because the quark - gluon compton subprocess is dominant , @xmath6 , this reaction provides essential information on the gluon density in the proton at large @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis suffers from fragmentation , isolation , and intrinsic transverse momentum uncertainties .",
    "alternatively , the gluon density can be constrained from the production of jets with large transverse momentum at hadron colliders @xcite , but the information from different experiments and colliders is ambiguous .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that , like prompt photon production , lepton pair production is dominated by quark - gluon scattering in the region @xmath2 .",
    "this realization means that new independent constraints on the gluon density may be derived from drell - yan data in kinematical regimes that are accessible in collider and fixed target experiments but without the theoretical and experimental uncertainties present in the prompt photon case .    in sec .",

    "in leading order ( lo ) qcd , two partonic subprocesses contribute to the production of virtual and real photons with non - zero transverse momentum : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the cross section for lepton pair production is related to the cross section for virtual photon production through the leptonic branching ratio of the virtual photon @xmath10 .",
    "the virtual photon cross section reduces to the real photon cross section in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections arise from virtual one - loop diagrams interfering with the lo diagrams and from real emission diagrams . at this order",
    "@xmath12 partonic processes with incident gluon pairs @xmath13 , quark pairs @xmath14 , and non - factorizable quark - antiquark @xmath15 processes contribute also .",
    "singular contributions are regulated in @xmath16=4 - 2@xmath17 dimensions and removed through @xmath18 renormalization , factorization , or cancellation between virtual and real contributions . an important difference between virtual and real photon production",
    "arises when a quark emits a collinear photon . whereas the collinear emission of a real photon leads to a @xmath19 singularity that has to be factored into a fragmentation function , the collinear emission of a virtual photon yields a finite logarithmic contribution since it is regulated naturally by the photon virtuality @xmath0 . in the limit",
    "@xmath11 the nlo virtual photon cross section reduces to the real photon cross section if this logarithm is replaced by a @xmath19 pole .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "the situation is completely analogous to hard photoproduction where the photon participates in the scattering in the initial state instead of the final state .",
    "for real photons , one encounters an initial - state singularity that is factored into a photon structure function . for virtual photons ,",
    "this singularity is replaced by a logarithmic dependence on the photon virtuality @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a remark is in order concerning the interval in @xmath1 in which our analysis is appropriate . in general , in two - scale situations , a series of logarithmic contributions will arise with terms of the type @xmath20 .",
    "thus , if either @xmath21 or @xmath22 , resummations of this series must be considered . for practical reasons , such as event rate , we do not venture into the domain @xmath21 , and our fixed - order calculation should be adequate . on the other hand , the cross section is large in the region @xmath22 . in previous papers  @xcite , we compared our cross sections with available fixed - target and collider data on massive lepton - pair production , and we were able to establish that fixed - order perturbative calculations , without resummation , should be reliable for @xmath23 . at smaller values of @xmath1 ,",
    "non - perturbative and matching complications introduce some level of phenomenological ambiguity . for the goal we have in mind ,",
    ", contraints on the gluon density , it would appear best to restrict attention to the region @xmath24 , but below @xmath21 .",
    "in this section we present numerical results for the production of lepton pairs in @xmath25 collisions at the tevatron with center - of mass energy @xmath26 and 2.0 tev .",
    "we analyze the invariant cross section @xmath27 averaged over the rapidity interval -1.0 @xmath28 1.0 .",
    "we integrate the cross section over various intervals of pair - mass @xmath0 and plot it as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath1 .",

    "in addition , for very large @xmath1 , the significant luminosity associated with the valence dominated @xmath46 density in @xmath25 reactions begins to raise the fraction of the cross section attributed to the @xmath44 subprocesses .",

    "in addition , the expected luminosity for run ii of 2 fb@xmath52 should make the cross section accessible to @xmath36 gev or @xmath53 . this extension would constrain the gluon density in the same regions as prompt photon production in run i.    next we present a study of the sensitivity of collider and fixed target experiments to the gluon density in the proton . the full uncertainty in the gluon density",
    "is not known . here",
    "we estimate this uncertainty from the variation of different recent parametrizations .",
    "we choose the latest global fit by the cteq collaboration ( 5 m ) as our point of reference @xcite and compare results to those based on their preceding analysis ( 4m@xcite ) and on a fit with a higher gluon density ( 5hj ) intended to describe the cdf and d0 jet data at large transverse momentum .",
