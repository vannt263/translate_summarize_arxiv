    "it is a prediction of the theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) that at hadron colliders the production of drell - yan pairs or weak gauge bosons ( @xmath9 and @xmath8 ) will generally be accompanied by gluon radiation .",
    "therefore , in order to test qcd theory or the electroweak properties of vector bosons , it is necessary to include the effects of multiple gluon emission . at the fermilab tevatron ( a @xmath10 collider )",
    ", we expect about @xmath11 @xmath9 and @xmath12 @xmath8 bosons produced at @xmath13tev , per @xmath14 of luminosity .",
    "this large sample of data is useful ( i ) for qcd studies ( with either single or multiple scales ) , ( ii ) as a tool for precision measurements of the @xmath15 boson mass and width , and ( iii ) as a probe for new physics ( e.g. , @xmath16 ) .",
    "achievement of these physics goals requires accurate predictions for the distributions of the rapidity and the transverse momentum of @xmath17 bosons and of their decay products .",
    "consider the production process @xmath18 .",
    "denote @xmath19 and @xmath20 to be the transverse momentum and the invariant mass of the vector boson @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath22 , there is only one hard scale and a fixed - order perturbation calculation is reliable . when @xmath23 , there are two hard scales and the convergence of the conventional perturbative expansion is impaired .",
    "hence , it is necessary to apply the technique of qcd resummation to combine the _ singular _ terms in each order of perturbative calculation , which yields : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath26 denotes @xmath27 and the explicit coefficients multiplying the logs are suppressed .",
    "resummation of large logarithms yields a sudakov form factor @xcite and cures divergences as @xmath28 .",
    "this resummation was pioneered by dokshitzer , dyakonov and troyan ( ddt ) who performed an analysis in @xmath19-space which led to a leading - log resummation formalism @xcite .",
    "later , parisi - petronzio showed @xcite that for large @xmath20 the @xmath28 region can be calculated perturbatively by imposing the condition of transverse momentum conservation , @xmath29 in @xmath0-space ( @xmath0 is the impact parameter , which is the fourier conjugate of @xmath19 ) .",
    "their improved formalism also sums some subleading - logs .",
    "they showed that as @xmath30 , events at @xmath31 may be obtained asymptotically by the emission of at least two gluons whose transverse momenta are not small and add to zero .",

    "collins and soper extended @xcite this work in @xmath0-space and applied the properties of the renormalization group invariance to create a formalism that resums all the large log terms to all orders in @xmath25 .    although various formalisms for resumming large @xmath39 terms have been proposed in the literature @xcite , we will concentrate in this paper on the formalism given by collins , soper and sterman ( css ) @xcite , which has been applied to studies of the production of single @xcite and double @xcite weak gauge bosons as well as higgs bosons @xcite at hadron colliders .",
    "in the css resummation formalism , the cross section is written in the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the rapidity of the vector boson @xmath21 , and the parton momentum fractions are defined as @xmath42 and @xmath43 with @xmath44 as the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy of the hadrons @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in eq .",

    "the perturbative calculation is no longer reliable . in order to account for",
    "non - perturbative contributions from the large @xmath0 region this formalism includes an additional multiplicative factor which contains measurable parameters .",
    "we refer the readers to ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion on how to apply the css resummation formalism to the phenomenology of hadron collider physics .",
    "as noted in the previous section , it is necessary to include an additional factor , usually referred to as the `` non - perturbative function '' , in the css resummation formalism in order to incorporate some long distance physics not accounted for by the perturbative derivation .",
    "collins and soper postulated @xcite @xmath73 with @xmath74 so that @xmath0 never exceeds @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be reliably calculated in perturbation theory .",
    "( in numerical calculations , @xmath75 is typically set to be of the order of @xmath77 . )",
    "based upon a renormalization group analysis , they found that the non - perturbative function can be generally written as @xmath78\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 must be extracted from data with the constraint that _ j|k^np(b=0)=1 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath79 only depends on @xmath20 , while @xmath80 and @xmath81 in general depend on @xmath51 or @xmath52 , and their values can depend on the flavor of the initial state partons ( @xmath60 and @xmath82 in this case ) .",
    "later , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the @xmath83 dependence is also suggested by infrared renormalon contributions to the @xmath19 distribution .",
    "the css resummation formalism suggests that the non - perturbative function should be universal .",
    "its role is analogous to that of the parton distribution function ( pdf ) in any fixed order perturbative calculation , as its value must be determined from data .",
    "the first attempt to determine such a universal non - perturbative function was made by davies , webber and stirling ( dws )  @xcite in 1985 who fit data available at that time to the resummed piece ( the @xmath85 term ) duke and owens parton distribution functions @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the dws results were combined with a nlo calculation @xcite by arnold and kauffman @xcite in 1991 to provide the first complete css prediction relevant to hadron collider drell - yan data . in 1994 ,",
    "ladinsky and yuan ( ly )  @xcite observed that the prediction of the dws set of @xmath84 deviates from r209 data ( @xmath86 at @xmath87gev ) using the cteq2 m pdf @xcite . in order to incorporate possible @xmath88 dependence , ly postulated a model for the non - perturbative term , which was different from that of dws , as @xmath89 , \\ ] ] where @xmath90 .",
    "a `` two - stage fit '' of the r209 , cdf-@xmath8 ( @xmath91 data ) and e288 ( @xmath92 ) data gave @xcite @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .. ] the purpose of the project described here is to update these non - perturbative parameters using modern , high - statistics samples of drell - yan data and to incorporate a fitting technique which will track the full error matrix for all fitted parameters .",
    "our results are given in the following sections .",
    "at the present time , the non - perturbative functions in the css resummation formalism can not be derived from qcd theory , so a variety of functional forms should be studied .",
    "the only necessary condition is that @xmath96 . for simplicity",

    ", , \\label{ly_form}\\ ] ] with a logarithamic @xmath101-dependent third term which is linear in @xmath0 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "both forms assume no flavor dependence for simplicity .",
    "in addition to fitting for the non - perturbative parameters , @xmath104 , the overall normalizations were allowed to float for some fits .",
    "one can also study another pure gaussian form with similar @xmath101 dependence such as b^2 .",
    "however , we find that current data are not yet precise enough to clearly separate the @xmath105 and @xmath106 parameters within this functional form and so it is not considered here .",
    "we also tested a few additional functions which did not incorporate additional parameters , but did not find any clear advantage to them when fitting the current drell - yan data .",
    "however , as to be shown later , the run  1 @xmath15/@xmath8 data at the tevatron are expected to determine the @xmath105 coefficient with good accuracy , and these data can be combined with the low energy drell - yan data to further test various scenarios for @xmath101 dependence and ultimately , universality .      in order to determine the non - perturbative functions discussed above , we need to choose experimental data sets for which the contribution to the non - perturbative piece dominates the transverse momentum distributions .",
    "this suggests using low energy fixed target or collider data in which the transverse momentum ( @xmath19 ) of the drell - yan pair is much less than its invariant mass ( @xmath20 ) . because the css resummation formalism better describes data in which the drell - yan pairs are produced in the central rapidity region ( as defined in the center - of - mass frame of the initial state hadrons ) we shall concentrate on data with those properties .",
    "based upon the above criteria we chose to consider data shown in table  [ data_table ] .",
    ".drell - yan data used in this analysis . here , @xmath107 is the published normalization uncertainty for each experiment .",
    "the cdf data were from tevatron collider run 0 of 4 pb@xmath7 . [",

    "values to be given below , the theory prediction for the e772 experiment is typically a factor of 2 smaller than the data . similarly , cteq fitting of pdf parameters are not well fit with these data @xcite . ] except where noted , all of the fits to @xmath110 were done using the cteq3 m pdf @xcite fits .",
    "as to be shown later , the e288 data have the smallest errors , and would be expected to dominate the result of a global fit .",
    "that is indeed the case .",
    "when including the e288 data in a global fit , we found that the resulting fit required the norm to be too large ( as compared to the experimental systematic error ) for either the e288 or the e605 data .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the r209 data can not be well described by the theory prediction based on such a fit .",
    "we therefore employed a different strategy for the global fit based on the statistical quality of the data .",
    "we included the first two mass bins ( @xmath112gev and @xmath113gev ) of the e605 data and all of the r209 and the cdf-@xmath8 boson data , in an initial global fit , referred to here as fit @xmath111 . in total , 31 data points were considered .",
    "we allowed the normalization of the r209 and e605 data to float within their overall systematic normalization errors , while fixing the normalization of the cdf-@xmath8 data to unity .",
    "( the point - to - point systematic error of 10% for the e605 data has also been included in the error bars of the data points shown in fig .",

    "in addition to the normalization factor for each experiment , the fitted parameters of our global fit include the coefficients @xmath114 and @xmath110 for the 2-parameter and 3-parameter fits , respectively .",
    "we found that , for @xmath99gev and @xmath115 , both the 2-parameter and the 3-parameter forms give good fits , with @xmath116 per degree of freedom about equal to 1.4 . and @xmath105 between 0 and 1 , and @xmath106 between @xmath117 and 3 . ]",
    "the best fitted central values for fit @xmath118 are : @xmath119 . while the central values for fit @xmath120 are @xmath121 .",

    "for the 3-parameter fit , the situation is more complicated , as the fitted values of @xmath123 s are highly correlated . in order to estimate the uncertainties of the fitted @xmath123 values",
    ", we fix the value ( at its best fit value ) of @xmath123 s , one at a time , and examine the uncertainties of the other two , in a way similar to studying the 2-parameter fit result .",
    "we found that @xmath127 constitute a conservative set of uncertainty ranges . with the understanding of the complexity discussed above",
    ", we characterize the uncertainties of the fitted @xmath123 s in the 3-parameter form conservatively by their maximal deviations , so that the best fitted @xmath123 values are : @xmath128 for the 2 and 3 parameter fits , respectively . in figs .",
    "[ fig : cont2 ] and [ fig : cont3 ] , we show the error ellipse projections from which we interpreted the errors of the above fits . in summary , fits @xmath118 and @xmath122 constitute the main results of this paper .",
    "given these values of @xmath123 s and the fitted normalization factors for the e605 data , we can calculate the two different predictions for the other three high mass bins not used in fits @xmath111 , and the results are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e605 ] . in order to compare with the e288 data ,",
    "we created fits @xmath129 in which we fix the @xmath123 s to those obtained from fit @xmath122 and fit for norm from the e288 data alone . fig .",
    "[ fig : e288 ] shows the resulting fits are acceptable , with values of norm close to the quoted 25% , namely , norm@xmath130 and @xmath131 for fits @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "it is encouraging that the quality of the fit for the e288 results is very similar to that for the e605 data and that the normalizations are now acceptably within the range quoted by the experiment .",
    "hence , we conclude that the fitted values of @xmath123 s reasonably describe the wide - ranging , complete set of data , as discussed above .",
    "we note that although the cdf-@xmath8 data , as shown in fig .

    "gives @xmath136 , which is in good agreement with the result of the global fit @xmath122 discussed above .",
    "hence , we conclude that the cdf-@xmath8 data already play an important role in constraining the @xmath105 parameter , which can be further improved with a large @xmath8 data samples from run  1 of the tevatron collider experiments",
    ". we shall defer its discussion to the next section .",
    "the run  1 @xmath15 and @xmath8 boson data at the tevatron can be useful as a test of universality and the @xmath101 dependence of the non - perturbative function @xmath97 .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdfz ] , where we give the predictions for the two different global fits ( 2-parameter and 3-parameter fits ) obtained in the previous section using the cteq3 m pdf parameterizations .",

    "@xcite , for @xmath137gev the non - perturbative function has little effect on the @xmath19 distribution , although in principle it affects the whole @xmath19 range ( up to @xmath22 ) .",
    "in order to study the resolving power of the full tevatron run  1 @xmath8 boson data in determining the non - perturbative function , we have performed a `` toy global fit '' , fit @xmath138 as follows .",
    "first , we generate a set of fake run  1 @xmath8 boson data ( assuming 5,500 reconstructed @xmath8 bosons in 24 @xmath19 bins between @xmath139  gev/@xmath140 ) using the original ly fit results ( @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) .",
    "then , we combine these fake-@xmath8 boson data with the r209 and e605 drell - yan data as discussed above to perform a global fit .",
    "the 3-parameter form results in @xmath144 with a @xmath145 per degree of freedom of approximately 1.3 .",
    "boson by about 5mev and 10mev , respectively @xcite . ]",
    "these fitted values for the @xmath123 s agree perfectly with those used to generate the fake-@xmath8 data except for the value of @xmath106 , which is smaller by a factor of 2 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this result agrees within @xmath146 with that of fit @xmath122 , using only the current low energy data , although the uncertainties on @xmath123 s are smaller by a factor of 2 .",
    "we have also performed the same fit for the 2-parameter form and obtained an equally good fit with @xmath147 while the new @xmath105 value ( @xmath148 ) obtained in fit @xmath149 is very different from that of @xmath118 ( @xmath150 ) given in the previous section , it is actually in good agreement with the @xmath105 value ( @xmath151 ) obtained from fit @xmath122 .",
    "this implies that the run  1 @xmath8 boson data , when combined with the low energy drell - yan data , can be extremely useful in determining the parameter @xmath105 . in figs .",

    "one interesting question is whether the result of this one - parameter fit alone can be used to also describe the @xmath19 distribution of the @xmath9 boson produced at the tevatron ( at the same energy ) .",
    "a quantitative estimate can be easily obtained by noting again that the difference between @xmath159 and @xmath160 with the @xmath15-boson mass @xmath161gev@xmath158 , is 0.08 , which are essentially the same , given the uncertainty of @xmath162 from @xmath153 .",
    "we conclude that it is indeed a good approximation to use the one - parameter fit result from fitting @xmath8 boson data in order to predict the @xmath19 distribution of the @xmath9 boson using the css resummation formalism . on the other hand , a single parameter without @xmath20 dependence ( i.e. the parameter @xmath163 alone ) does not give a reasonable global fit to all of the drell - yan data discussed above .",
