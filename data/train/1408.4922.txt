    "since the later part of nineteenth century , the field of chaos has attracted intense interest and active investigations .",
    "this may be attributed to the exciting applications that chaos finds in such diverse fields as engineering , communications , bio - medicine , chemical kinetics , neural networks , visual sensing , music , etc @xcite .",
    "research in this emerging field has been aided to a great extent by nonlinear electronic circuits , especially those having piecewise - linear nonlinearities .",
    "prominent among the piecewise - linear circuits are the chua s circuit family employing the well known chua s diode as their nonlinear element @xcite .",
    "the reason for the popularity of these circuits is that their nonlinear element , namely chua s diode can be realized easily using simple circuit elements while at the same time it is also mathematically tractable @xcite .",
    "different circuits in this chua s family exhibit different dynamical behaviours based on parameters as well as the configuration of the chua s diode in the circuit . however even among the chua s circuit family ,",
    "the canonical chua s circuit occupies a prime position .",
    "this is because the canonical chua s circuit can generate all possible phenomena associated with any three region symmetric piecewise - linear continuous vector field while at the same time it contains a minimum ( _ six _ ) number of circuit elements @xcite . yet in spite of their versatility , the applications of chua s circuit family are limited to low frequency ranges .",
    "also the presence of the discrete inductor makes them impossible for fabrication on ics . to overcome these difficulties as well as to improve the frequency performance ,",
    "two different approaches have been followed .",
    "first one is to redesign chua s diode using current feedback operational amplifiers ( cfoas ) @xcite .",
    "this is based on the fact that cfoas have high slew rate and high speed operations @xcite .",
    "high frequency operation of the chua s circuit , necessitates scaling down of inductance and capacitance values to impractically low levels . while very low levels of capacitor values can be realized , those of inductances are not possible .",
    "so the discrete inductor is to be replaced with synthetic inductance simulator .",
    "hence the second approach is to construct chua s circuit with both synthetic inductor and the chua s diode designed using cfoas @xcite .",
    "while these modifications for high frequency operation have been implemented for the chua s oscillator , to the best of our knowledge no such high frequency modifications for canonical chua s circuit is available till date .",
    "hence in this paper , we propose an improved realization of canonical chua s circuit with active elements and synthetic inductor using cfoas .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the classical chua s circuit and its cfoa based implementations , are discussed .",
    "the voltage operational amplifier based canonical chua s circuit is described briefly in section 3 along with the simulation results .",
    "the implementation of the improved canonical chua s circuit is described in section 4 .",
    "the realization of active elements used in this circuit are also explained in detail here .",
    "a theoretical estimation of the maximum frequency of operation of this circuit is made in section 5 .",
    "the results of multisim simulations , confirming the theoretical estimates of high frequency operations , are presented in section 6 .",
    "experimental realization of the circuit and the performance of the circuit at high frequencies are discussed in section 7 . finally in section 8 ,",
    "the importance of this circuit and scope for further developments are discussed .",
    "in this section and the next , we describe the realizations of the classical chua s circuit , the cfoa based chua s circuit and the canonical chua s circuit with the view to understand the differences in their topologies .",
    "the classical chua s circuit shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , is a three dimensional piecewise - linear autonomous circuit consisting of a linear resistor , three linear dynamic elements ( two capacitors and an inductor ) and the chua s diode as its nonlinear resistor ( @xmath0 ) . the chua s diode is realized experimentally using two operational amplifiers and six linear resistors as shown in fig .",
    "it is characterized by a five - segment odd symmetric piecewise - linear voltage - current ( _ v@xmath1i _ ) characteristic ( fig .",
    "1(c ) ) . from fig .",
    "1(b ) , we find that this chua s diode is a configuration of two negative impedance converters connected in parallel . for the standard values of resistors shown in fig.1(b ) , the slopes of the characteristic curve ( fig .",
    "1(c ) ) are @xmath2 ma / v , @xmath3 ma / v and @xmath4a / v .",
    "the breakpoints are @xmath5 v and @xmath6 v @xcite .",
    "however , it is to be noted that even though the chua s diode has a five segment characteristic , the circuit operation lies in the negative slope regions only @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of this classical chua s circuit have been studied extensively using numerical simulations and hardware experiments @xcite . the same classical chua s circuit has been modified by replacing the chua s diode and discrete inductor coil with cfoa based nonlinearity and synthetic inductor .",
    "the dynamics of this improved chua s circuit has been extensively studied experimentally in ref . @xcite .",
    "the canonical chua s circuit realized using voltage operational amplifiers ( voas ) is shown in fig .",
    "this is also a three dimensional piecewise - linear autonomous circuit , consisting of two capacitors and an inductor .",
    "it has two active elements namely a nonlinear resistor ( @xmath7 ) and a negative conductor ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the nonlinear resistor ( @xmath7 ) , shown in fig .",
    "2b(i ) is conceived by connecting a negative impedance converter in parallel with a linear resistor resulting in a voltage - current characteristic curve having three distinct regions separated by two symmetrically placed breakpoints ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the central region between the two breakpoints has a negative slope while the other two outer regions have positive slopes .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "2b(ii ) . for a given set of resistor values , ( @xmath10 k@xmath11 , @xmath12 k@xmath11 , @xmath13 k@xmath11 and @xmath14 ) the slopes of the characteristic curve are @xmath15 ma / v , @xmath16 ma / v and break points are @xmath17 v. the negative conductor is just a negative impedance converter designed using operational amplifier and three resistors as shown in fig .",
    "its characteristic curve is shown in fig .",
    "the slope of the negative conductance region is @xmath18 ma / v for the resistor values @xmath19 k@xmath11 .    by choosing the parameters of the canonical chua s circuit as @xmath20 nf , @xmath21 mh , @xmath22 and varying the @xmath23 from 100 nf to 40 nf",
    ", the circuit exhibits the standard period doubling route to chaos .",
    "intermittency and other dynamical phenomena are also observed for a different set of parametric values @xcite . keeping the parameters fixed as mentioned above and having @xmath24 nf , a double band chaotic attractor shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) is observed .",
    "the power spectrum of the variable @xmath25 for the double band chaotic attractor is shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) . from this power spectrum , the operating frequency of the circuit",
    "is estimated to be 2.69 khz .",
    "this low range of frequency of operation is further confirmed by implementing voa based canonical chua s circuit using state controlled cellular neural network ( sc - cnn ) . in this study , the operation frequency of the circuit was centered around 2 khz for single band chaos and 0.9 khz for double band chaos @xcite .",
    "though the canonical chua s circuit is truly canonical , in that it exhibits all the behaviours that are possible with any three region symmetric piecewise - linear continuous vector field , its main limitation is that of low maximal frequency of operation .",
    "this is attributed to the limitations of voas such as low slew rate , fixed gain - bandwidth product , etc @xcite .",
    "an improved canonical chua s circuit that overcomes these limitations can be had if two modifications are made .",
    "firstly , the two active elements , namely negative conductor ( @xmath8 ) and nonlinear resistor ( @xmath0 ) are realized using four terminal current feedback operational amplifiers ( cfoas ) .",
    "secondly , the inductance coil is replaced with a synthetic inductor ( @xmath26 ) realized using cfoas .",
    "the cfoas are chosen because of their high speed and high slew rate which resulting in high frequency of operation @xcite .",
    "this improved canonical chua s circuit so constructed is given in fig .",
    "4 .    in the following subsections",
    ", we describe the realization of the cfoa based active elements ( @xmath27 ) as well as synthetic inductor @xmath28 used in the circuit . during these circuit implementations ,",
    "ad844an type cfoas biased with @xmath29 v dc dual power supply were used .",
    "the negative conductance is obtained from the linear negative region of the negative impedance converter .  since , canonical chua s circuit operates only in the linear region of the nic , the cfoa used here are a cascade of second generation current conveyors ( ccii ) .",
    "this cciis are generally realized by effecting a direct current feedback to the non - inverting terminal of an operational amplifier and connecting a grounded resistor from its inverting terminal , as shown in fig .",
    "5a(i ) @xcite . in this negative conductor sub - circuit , output voltage terminal ( @xmath30 ) is kept open .",
    "this results in a direct flow of voltage across the non - inverting terminal .",
    "the characteristic curve that results in the ( _ v@xmath1i _ ) plane is given in fig .",
    "the negative slope of this sub - circuit can be depicted from the expression @xmath31 for the value of the resistance ( @xmath32 k@xmath11 ) , the value of slope , obtained through simulation experiment is @xmath18 ma / v .",
    "this agrees well with the theoretical prediction .",
    "this cfoa based design of negative conductor circuit results in a reduction in the number of passive resistors by two , when compared to the original voa based realizations which were used earlier .      the nonlinear resistor ( @xmath7 ) in fig .",
    "2b(i ) is designed using a conventional operational amplifier and four resistors .",
    "it operates as a voltage controlled negative impedance converter .",
    "this sub - circuit is reconstructed using current feedback operational amplifier . in this realization shown in fig .",
    "5b(i ) , the current terminal c is kept open or equivalently output current is equal to zero .",
    "this causes the current feedback operational amplifier to work as a voltage operational amplifier , whose characteristic has one negative and two positive slopes and two breakpoints as shown in fig 5b(ii ) .",
    "the expressions for the slopes and break points are given by @xcite , @xmath33    by choosing the values of the various resistors as , @xmath34 k@xmath11 , @xmath35 k@xmath11 , @xmath36 k@xmath11 and @xmath37 and using eqns .",
    "( 2 - 4 ) , the slopes and break points are given as @xmath38 ma / v , @xmath39 ma / v and @xmath40 v. the multisim simulation of the circuit with the above mentioned parametric values also results in an identical characteristic curve with slopes and break points given by @xmath41 ma / v , @xmath42 ma / v and @xmath43 v. as is to be expected , there is close matching between theoretical and circuit simulation results .",
    "though the inductor is an important passive device , it is a less desirable element @xcite , because of its inability to lend itself to integration .",
    "hence the spiral inductor is widely used during the implementation of the integrated circuits .",
    "even this has some drawbacks such as low tunability , large space , weight and high cost @xcite . hence to overcome these difficulties , inductance simulators",
    "are used as substitutes for inductor coils in many circuit applications .",
    "there are two major kinds of inductance simulators , namely ( _ i _ ) the grounded inductance simulator wherein one of its terminals is grounded and ( _ ii _ ) the floating inductance simulator wherein neither of the terminals are grounded .",
    "both of these are generally used in the realization of electrical circuits .",
    "a large number of circuit realizations for floating inductance simulators have been reported in the literature @xcite . in this present study ,",
    "the cfoa based floating inductance simulator developed by senani has been used @xcite .",
    "this is because the cfoas are proven to be quite useful in either current or voltage mode signal processing circuits @xcite . the inductance simulator so obtained is shown in fig . 5(c ) .",
    "it is a combination of three cfoas with two passive resistors and a capacitor connected in both voltage and current modes .",
    "it yields the equivalent inductance as @xmath44 the following elements value are chosen as @xmath45 k@xmath11 and @xmath46 nf/@xmath47 pf to simulate @xmath48 mh/@xmath49h .",
    "the incorporation of these cfoa based elements in the improved canonical chua s circuit has enhanced its frequency of operation .",
    "this has been estimated theoretically in next section as well as proved from multisim simulation in section 6 .",
    "as we are focusing on the enhancement of operating frequency of the canonical chua s circuit , it is desirable that we estimate the frequency of operation theoretically .",
    "this can be done by writing down the dynamical equations of the canonical chua s circuit ( fig .",
    "4 ) and obtaining its characteristic equation .",
    "the circuit equations can be obtained by applying kirchoff s laws @xcite .",
    "they are    @xmath50    where @xmath51 represents the simulated inductance ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath52 represents the characteristic of the nonlinear resistor ( @xmath7 ) whose mathematical form is , @xmath53 .",
    "\\label{eq : cano1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the inner negative and outer positive slopes of the three segment piecewise - linear characteristic of nonlinear resistor and @xmath56 represents the break points .",
    "the characteristic equation of the linearized canonical chua s circuit corresponding to the inner region can be written by @xmath57 where @xmath58 similarly , the characteristic equation for the two outer segments can be obtained as , @xmath59 the corresponding coefficients in these cases are given as , @xmath60 the condition for oscillation is @xmath61 for the central region and correspondingly @xmath62 for the outer regions .",
    "the radian frequency of oscillation is found to vary in the range ( @xmath63 ) . or",
    "alternatively , the linear frequency of oscillation is given as @xmath64    for the specific choice of parameters , @xmath65 nf , @xmath24 nf , @xmath48 mh , @xmath66 , @xmath18 ma / v and @xmath41 ma / v , for the inner region , the frequency of oscillation calculated using the eqn .",
    "( [ eq : real_fre ] ) is @xmath67 mhz .",
    "however for the outer region , as the slope takes on a positive value , namely @xmath42 ma / v , no oscillations will be generated @xcite .",
    "only an exponential decay of any oscillatory energy is seen .",
    "this means that the frequency of oscillations will be @xmath68 mhz in the outer regions .",
    "hence , the central operating frequency of the circuit is expected to be within these lower and upper bounds , that is , @xmath68 mhz @xmath69 mhz .",
    "to validate our theoretical predictions , we have also studied the circuit by simulating its behaviour using multisim - a popular spice based circuit simulation software .",
    "the multisim model of the proposed circuit is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath26 refer to the negative conductor , nonlinear resistor and synthetic inductor respectively .",
    "the voltage output terminal in the negative conductor is kept free .",
    "it is the direct buffered isolated output of the state variable @xmath71 of the circuit connected to the non - inverting input of the negative conductor @xmath8 .",
    "the circuit parameters @xmath72 , @xmath23 and @xmath26 are fixed as constant values and the series linear resistor @xmath73 is used as control parameter . in order to observe the performance of the circuit in low as well as high frequency regions , we have chosen two sets of parameters .    for the low frequency range ,",
    "the parameter values are fixed as @xmath65 nf , @xmath24 nf and @xmath48 mh as is the case for a conventional voa based circuit . by decreasing the control parameter value @xmath73 from @xmath74 , we observed the standard period doubling bifurcation route to chaos .",
    "the double band chaotic dynamics of the circuit obtained when @xmath75 was found to have an operating frequency centered around 760 hz .",
    "for the high frequency range , the parameters of the circuit was scaled down by the factor 1000 .",
    "this resulted in the reduction of the parameter values .",
    "the reduced values are @xmath65 pf , @xmath24 pf and @xmath76h .",
    "similar to the low frequency operation , here also when the control parameter @xmath73 was decreased in value from 1000@xmath77 , the circuit was found to exhibit the standard period doubling route to chaos .",
