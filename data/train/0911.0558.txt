    "the charge carriers in a pristine graphene show linear and isotropic energy dispersion relation and massless chiral behavior for the energy scales up to 1 ev .",
    "recently , graphene has revealed a variety of unusual transport phenomena characteristics of two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac fermions such as an anomalous integer quantum hall effect at room temperature , a minimum quantum conductivity , klein tunneling paradox , weak and anti - localization , an absence of wigner crystallization phase and shubnikov - dehaas oscillations that exhibit a phase shift of @xmath3 due to berry s phase .",
    "@xcite one important difference between conventional electron gas and dirac fermion particle is that the contribution of exchange and correlation to the chemical potential is an increasing rather than a decreasing function of carrier - density .",
    "this property implies that exchange and correlation increase the effectiveness of screening , in contrast to the usual case in which exchange and correlation weakens screening .",
    "this unusual property follows from the difference in sublattice pseudospin chirality between the dirac model s negative energy valence band states and its conduction band states .",
    "the massless dirac - like carriers in graphene have almost semi - ballistic transport behavior with small resistance due to the suppression of back - scattering process , and moreover graphene is a good thermal conductor .",
    "@xcite the mobility of carriers in graphene is quite high  @xcite which is much higher than the electron mobility revealed on the semiconductor hetrostructures .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , by measuring the stiffness of materials it is shown that graphene is the strongest material in two - dimension structures .",
    "@xcite these properties as well as capability to control of the type and density of charge carriers by gate voltage or the chemical doping  @xcite make graphene an ideal candidate for superior nano - electronic devices operating at high frequencies .",
    "most electronic applications are based on the presence of a gap between the valence and conduction bands in the conventional semiconductors .",
    "the band gap is a measure of the threshold voltage and on - off ratio of the field effect transistors ( fets ) .",
    "@xcite therefore , for integrating graphene into semiconductor technology , it is crucial to induce a band gap in dirac points to control the transport of carriers .",

    "moreover , based on the _ ab initio _ calculations , it is suggested that boron nitride substrate induced a gap of 53 mev .",
    "@xcite note that the gap value calculated within dft is in general underestimating the true band gap value .    in this paper",
    "we consider the sublattice symmetry breaking mechanism for a gap opening in a pristine doped graphene sheet and study the impact of gap upon some electronic properties of qps . to investigate the influence of gap in the many - body properties of qp in graphene we use the random phase approximation ( rpa ) and the g@xmath0w approximation .",

    "the electronic structure of graphene can be reasonably good described using a rather simple tight - binding hamiltonian , leading to analytical solutions for their energy dispersion and related eigenstates .",

    "the two eigenvalues of noninteracting hamiltonian are given by @xmath14 for conduction band ( + ) and valance band ( - ) which is a fully occupied .",
    "in addition , the model hamiltonian can be used as an approximated model for describing a graphene antidot lattice in the vicinity of a band gap with a small effective mass value  @xcite , or moreover used as an effective hamiltonian for the intrinsic spin - orbit interaction in graphene where @xmath15 is the strength of the spin - orbit interaction .",

    "we consider the long - range coulomb electron - electron interaction .",

    "sharp cutoffs in the imaginary part of @xmath46 are related to the rapid swing in the real part of @xmath46 .",
    "these behaviors are in result of the fact that the real and imaginary parts of the polarization function are related through the kramers - krnig relations .",
    "importantly , the sign change of the real part from negative to positive shows a sweep across the electron - hole continuum . at very large gap values , the polarization function of massive dirac fermions can be reduced to the polarization function ( the lindhard s function ) of conventional two dimensional electron gas systems , as they are determined in figs .  1 and 2 .",

    ".,width=264 ]    it is essential to note that the satellite band which is theoretically predicted  @xcite for gapless garphene has not been seen in experiments .",
    "there are several reasons that could wash out this feature .",
    "for example , the plasmon damping , disorder effects , electron interactions with the buffer layer and importantly the effect of gap at dirac point .",
    "one of the important information which can be extracted from arpes spectra is the renormalized fermi velocity @xmath153 .",
    "a consequence of the interaction is a fermi velocity renormalization from the backflow of the fluid around a moving particle .",
    "the density of states at the fermi energy is also changed . the qp energy measured from the chemical potential of interacting system @xmath154 ,",

    "@xcite    fig .",

    "the renormalized fermi velocity decreasing with increasing the gap value .",
    "@xmath153 is density independent after @xmath161 which is in good agreement with recent experiment observation .",

    "@xcite the bgr for conductance band is given by the qp self - energy at the band edge , namely @xmath162 . fig .",
    "10 shows the bgr for the various gap values as a function of the electron density .",
    "the bgr decreases by increasing of the electron density and in the small energy gap values , it is less density dependent respect to large energy gap values . in gapless case",

    "we have performed a systematic study is based on the many - body g@xmath0w approach that is established upon the random - phase - approximation and on graphene s massive dirac equation continuum model .",
    "we have carried out extensive calculations of both the real and the imaginary part of the qp self - energy and discussed about the interband and intraband contributions in the scattering process in the presence of gap value .",
    "we have also presented results for the effective velocity and for the band gap renormalization over a wide range of coupling strength .",
    "accordingly , we have critically examined the merits of the gap values in dynamical qp properties .",
    "most feature of mass generating in graphene is the washing out of the plasmaron peak in the spectral weight .",
    "increasing of the gap value makes density independent behavior of the renormalized fermi velocity .",
    "we have shown that the band gap renormalization in gapped graphene decreases by increasing the carrier density at large @xmath47 .",
    "this is in contrast with the gapless case in which many body electron - plasmon interactions induce a very small gap in band structure .",
    "these distinct features of the massive dirac s fermions are related to mixing of the chiralities and reduce of the interband transitions in graphene sheets .",
