    "research on mechanical systems in the quantum regime has reached several milestones in the past few years . a micromechanical oscillator in the quantum ground state was first observed in an experiment by oconnell _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the high - frequency dilational motion of a slab of dielectric material was coupled to a superconducting qubit .",
    "this enabled verifying that the mechanical oscillator was in the ground state , as well as the ability to controllably create single phonons .",
    "the very high mechanical resonance frequency of @xmath0  ghz ensured that the quantum ground state was reached simply by conventional refrigeration techniques .",
    "quantum behaviour of mechanical oscillators has later been achieved in cavity opto- or electromechanical systems , where the mechanical motion is coupled to light or microwaves .",
    "resolved sideband cooling of mechanical motion to the quantum ground state @xcite was achieved in an experiment by teufel _",
    "et al . _",
    "on an electromechanical system @xcite .",
    "this technique has also been successfully employed in the optical regime with silicon nanoscale resonators @xcite , where the quantization of mechanical motion has been directly measured @xcite . in a setup coupling light to the collective motion of cold atoms , quantization of motion @xcite and ponderomotive squeezing of the light @xcite have been reported .",
    "the optomechanical system of a thin silicon nitride membrane placed inside an optical fabry - prot cavity @xcite has also attracted considerable attention recently @xcite .",
    "the flexural modes of the membrane give rise to the same physics as a cavity with a movable end mirror .",
    "in addition , one can achieve coupling of the light to the square of the mechanical displacement @xcite , which could enable nondemolition measurements of the phonon number @xcite or of phonon shot noise @xcite .",
    "the idea of using such a membrane as a transducer between optical and electrical degrees of freedom has been proposed @xcite .",
    "finally , the membrane s coupling to light was recently exploited in an experiment to effectively couple the motion of the membrane and the motion of cold atoms @xcite .    while the membrane - in - the - middle setup is promising , laser cooling of the flexural modes to the ground state is a considerable challenge .",
    "one reason for this is the typically low resonance frequencies of these modes , usually in the range of 0.1 - 10 mhz , which corresponds to a very low effective temperature necessary to reach the ground state .",
    "however , in addition to the flexural modes , the membrane also experiences thickness oscillations , i.e.  a dilational mode similar to the motion studied in the experiment by oconnell _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . if the membrane is very thin , the thickness oscillation has a much higher frequency than the flexural modes .",
    "the frequency is approximately given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the speed of sound in the membrane and @xmath3 is the membrane thickness .",
    "note that thin - film dilational modes of this type have been detected in free - standing silicon membranes by using laser pulses @xcite . for silicon nitride membranes with thicknesses of a micrometer or less",
    ", the mechanical resonance frequencies will be on the order of ghz or tens of ghz .",
    "hence , provided that the coupling between this dilational mode and light is sufficiently strong , the membrane - in - the - middle setup could also give rise to an optomechanical system where the mechanical oscillator is in the ground state already at dilution refrigeration temperatures .",
    "another useful feature of the very high mechanical frequency is that it is of the same size as the free spectral range in standard optical cavities , so the dilational mode will effectively couple cavity modes at different frequencies .",
    "this type of frequency matching was recently exploited in a different type of optomechanics experiment @xcite .    in this article",
    "we investigate the coupling between the thickness variation of a thin dielectric membrane and an optical cavity field . in sections",
    "[ sec : optcavmodes ] and [ sec : mechmodes ] , we characterize the uncoupled optical and mechanical modes , respectively .",
    "the coupling comes about both due to the membrane thickness variation itself ( a boundary effect ) as well as the fact that elastic strain in the membrane leads to a change in the electric permittivity ( a bulk effect ) . in general",
    ", both effects must be taken into account when light interacts with the motion of dielectric objects @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : hamiltonian ] , we derive a second quantized hamiltonian and quantify the coupling strengths between the optical cavity modes and the mechanical oscillation . by inserting realistic parameters , we show in section [ sec : estimation ] that the coupling can be strong enough for optomechanical effects to be observable , provided that the as yet unknown mechanical quality factor exceeds a certain value . in section [ sec : amplifier ] , we show how this system can be used as a quantum limited optical amplifier , due to the vanishingly small thermal occupation of the mechanical mode .",
    "finally we study how one can produce quantum correlations between different cavity modes with this setup in section [ sec : correlations ] .",
    "we calculate a two - mode squeezing spectrum and find that one can achieve considerable squeezing for sufficiently large mechanical quality factors .",
    "in addition , we identify an explicit signature of radiation pressure shot noise .",
    "we will consider the setup of a thin dielectric membrane placed inside an optical fabry - prot cavity , depicted in fig .",

    ". thus , except for special values of the membrane position @xmath21 or the thickness @xmath3 for which the coupling vanishes , the dimensionless number @xmath136 is always of order 1 .",
    "the coupling strength is therefore determined by @xmath137 , which is the familiar coupling rate in the canonical optomechanical system of a cavity with a movable mirror .",

    "@xcite , where the calculation of coupling strengths to the flexural modes produce similar expressions .    the first term in the paranthesis in eq .",

    "we see that these terms are of opposite signs for @xmath143 and of the same sign for @xmath144 .",

    "finally , note that the photoelastic term vanishes when the membrane thickness becomes much larger than the optical wavelength .",
    "this is as expected , since this term is , roughly speaking , an integral of two orthogonal optical modes over the thickness of the membrane .",

    "indeed , the mechanical frequency can be matched to the free spectral range of the cavity .",
    "hence , we will consider two optical modes @xmath14 and @xmath44 that are separated by the mechanical frequency @xmath146 , such that the intermode terms proportional to @xmath148 and @xmath149 are resonant .",
    "this means that the annihilation ( creation ) of a phonon will convert a photon from mode @xmath14 ( @xmath44 ) to mode @xmath44 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "defining @xmath50 , note that the frequency shift ( [ eq : freqcorr ] ) ensures that @xmath150 whenever @xmath151 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : freqs ] ) .",
    "thus , by placing the membrane at a position where @xmath152 , we can focus on just two optical modes .",
    "furthermore , in the resolved sideband regime @xmath153 , we can neglect the intramode coupling @xmath138 as well as the counter - rotating terms in the intermode coupling .",
    "the maximal difference between @xmath154 and @xmath155 occurs when @xmath156 .",

    "normalized to the integral for the fundamental mode @xmath131 as a function of the cavity waist diameter @xmath178 .",
    "this shows that when the waist size becomes comparable to the membrane s transverse dimension @xmath18 , coupling of the light to the fundamental mode @xmath84 is significantly stronger than to the other vibrational modes . ]",
    "we see that when the cavity waist is comparable in size to the membrane s transverse dimensions , i.e.  @xmath179 , the optomechanical coupling to the fundamental mode is dominant , which is another reason for using a membrane with a small side length @xmath18 .",
    "the neglect of the other modes with @xmath173 or @xmath180 thus appears to be justifiable , although one should keep in mind that they are there and might influence experiments .      in section [ sec : estimation ]",
    ", we will show that the coupling strength @xmath181 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : twomodemodel ] ) is typically very small compared to the cavity and oscillator decay rates .",
    "we therefore consider the situation where one of the cavity modes is strongly driven .",
    "let us first assume that the upper mode ( mode 2 ) is strongly driven by a laser with frequency @xmath182 . transforming to the frame rotating at the drive frequency @xmath183 , and neglecting small nonlinear terms , we get the parametric amplification hamiltonian @xmath184 here , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the average number of photons in cavity mode 2 .",

    "it is well known that these hamiltonians can be realized in the resolved sideband regime in ordinary single - mode cavity optomechanics by driving at either the blue or red sideband frequency .",
    "the difference in this case is that the drive frequencies are on resonance with other cavity modes , similar to the situation in ref .",

    "in section [ sec : fullham ] , we saw that the optomechanical coupling strength is determined by the rate @xmath207 .",
    "for a cavity of length @xmath208  cm , this becomes @xmath209  hz .",
    "this is comparable to the coupling strength to the flexural modes of the membrane in experiments performed with longer cavities @xcite .",

    "<S> the interaction between a high - frequency dilational mode of a thin dielectric film and an optical cavity field is studied theoretically in the membrane - in - the - middle setup . </S>",
    "<S> a derivation from first principles leads to a multi - mode optomechanical hamiltonian where multiple cavity modes are coupled by the thickness variation of the membrane . for membrane thicknesses on the order of one micron , </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of this dilational mode is in the ghz range . </S>",
    "<S> this can be matched to the free spectral range of the optical cavity , such that the mechanical oscillator will resonantly couple cavity modes at different frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , such a large mechanical frequency also means that the quantum ground state of motion can be reached with conventional refrigeration techniques . </S>",
    "<S> estimation of the coupling strength with realistic parameters suggests that optomechanical effects can be observable with this dilational mode . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown how this system can be used as a quantum limited optical amplifier . </S>",
    "<S> the dilational motion can also lead to quantum correlations between cavity modes at different frequencies , which is quantified with an experimentally accessible two - mode squeezing spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> finally , an explicit signature of radiation pressure shot noise in this system is identified . </S>"
