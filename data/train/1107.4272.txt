    "in the last decades the searches for a dark matter ( dm ) signal from the sun were performed looking for possible excesses of neutrinos or gamma - rays associated with the sun s direction . however , as it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , several dm models that have been recently developed to explain various experimental results also imply an associated solar flux of high - energy cosmic - ray electrons and positrons ( cres ) . on the other hand ,",
    "no known astrophysical mechanisms are expected to generate a significant high - energy cre @xmath0 excess associated with the sun .    a class of models in which dm annihilates to cres through a new light intermediate state @xmath1 @xcite has been considered to explain the excesses in local cre fluxes reported by pamela  @xcite , atic  @xcite , and _ fermi _  @xcite .",
    "in these scenarios dm particles captured by the sun through elastic scattering interactions would annihilate to @xmath1 pairs in the sun s core , and if the @xmath1 could escape the surface of the sun before decaying to cres , these models could produce an observable cre flux .",
    "another class of models in which dm scatters off of nucleons predominantly via inelastic scattering has been proposed as a means of reconciling the results of dama and dama / libra  @xcite with cdms - ii  @xcite and other experiments ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite for a comprehensive discussion of experimental constraints ) . if dm is captured by the sun only through inelastic scattering ( idm ) , this could lead to a non - negligible fraction of dm annihilating outside of the sun s surface . for models in which idm annihilates to cres ,",
    "an observable flux at energies above a few tens of gev could be produced .    during its first year of operation , the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the _ fermi _ satellite  @xcite has collected a substantial number of cre events , which has allowed a precise measurement of the energy spectrum over a broad energy range from a few @xmath2 up to @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a directional analysis of the high - energy cre events was performed in the galactic reference frame  @xcite , and showed no evidence of anisotropies .    in this paper",
    "we use the high - energy cre data set to search for flux variations correlated with the sun s direction .",
    "since the sun is moving with respect to the galactic reference frame , the previously - reported absence of anisotropies in the cre flux observed in the galactic frame does not necessarily imply a negative result .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat is a pair - conversion telescope designed to detect gamma rays in the energy range from @xmath4 to more than @xmath5 .",
    "a full description of the apparatus is given in  @xcite . even though it is a photon detector ,",
    "it has been demonstrated that the lat is also an excellent cre detector  @xcite .",
    "for this analysis we used the cre data sample collected by the lat during its first year of operation , starting from august 4 , 2008 .",
    "the event selection was performed in the same way as in ref .",
    "@xcite ; approximately @xmath6 cre events with energies larger than @xmath7 passed the selection cuts . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the energy threshold of @xmath7 was chosen because it is higher than the geomagnetic cutoff in any part of _ fermi _ s orbit .",
    "unlike gamma rays , cres are deflected by interactions with magnetic fields encountered during their propagation in interstellar space .",
    "in particular , cres coming from the sun are deflected by both the sun s and the earth s magnetic fields .",
    "geomagnetic effects on cres have been studied using a code that reconstructs the trajectories of charged particles in the earth s magnetic field based on the international geomagnetic reference field ( igrf ) model  @xcite . since the _ fermi _ lat can not measure the sign of the electric charge , we associated both an electron and a positron track with each cre event detected by the lat .",
    "each track starts from the detection point with the same energy of the event and with a direction opposite to that of the event , and ends at a very large distance ( larger than 100 earth - radii from the earth s center ) .",
    "the distribution of deflection angles at different energies was analyzed .",
    "the simulation demonstrated that , at energies above @xmath8 , @xmath9 of the particles are deflected with respect to the original direction within an angle @xmath10 given by the approximate formula :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the particle energy .",
    "hence , due to the geomagnetic field , the reconstructed directions of cres with energies above @xmath13 detected by the lat and coming from any given direction of the sky will be spread over a cone with an angular radius of about @xmath14 centered on the original incoming direction .",
    "the directions of incoming cres are also affected by the heliospheric magnetic field . a detailed study of its effects on cres is beyond the scope of this work , however in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that cres with energies of several hundreds of @xmath2 can travel through the center of the solar system without experiencing significant deflections .",
    "cres travelling in the solar system may also suffer energy losses , mainly due to the inverse compton ( ic ) scatterings on the photons emitted by the sun and to the synchrotron radiation ( sr ) emitted in the interactions with the heliospheric magnetic field . to study the energy loss processes of cres travelling from the sun to the earth we implemented a simple toy model , in which we assumed that cres propagate from the sun s surface to the earth in straight lines and with velocity @xmath15 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we assumed that the sun can be modeled as a black body with a temperature of @xmath16 and with a photon density given by :    @xmath17\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the blackbody photon energy density ( planck s equation ) , @xmath19 is the solar radius and @xmath20 is the distance from the center of the sun .",
    "the ic energy loss rate of cres was then evaluated as in ref .  @xcite as :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the velocity and the lorentz factor of the cre , @xmath24 is the photon energy density evaluated from eq .",
    "[ eq : blackbody ] , @xmath25 is the thomson cross section and @xmath26 is given by :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the electron mass , @xmath29 is the boltzmann s constant and @xmath30 is the temperature of the sun s surface .",
    "the evaluation of the sr energy loss rate is not easy , because the structure of the heliospheric magnetic field is rather complex  @xcite .",
    "however , as a first approximation , we assumed that the strength of the heliospheric magnetic field drops from the sun s surface as :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the strength of the field on the sun s surface .",
    "we did not include the contribution of the geomagnetic field to synchrotron energy losses because , even though the field strength at the lat altitude is of the order of @xmath33 , the path length of cres in the geomagnetic field is of the order of a few earth radii , which is negligible with respect to the path length in the heliospheric magnetic field , which is of the order of a few solar radii .",
    "the synchrotron energy loss rate of cres was then calculated as  @xcite :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the magnetic field energy density that includes only the contribution from the heliospheric magnetic field and , in our model , results to be negliglible with respect to the ic energy loss rate . using eqs .",
    "[ eq : icloss ] and  [ eq : syncloss ] , we calculated that cres in the energy range from @xmath7 to @xmath3 travelling from the sun to the earth lose no more than @xmath36 of their initial energy . therefore , in the calculations of the following sections , we will neglect all energy loss processes .",
    "to study the cre flux from the sun s direction and to search for variations with respect to the average flux , we implemented two complementary analysis approaches : ( i ) flux asymmetry analysis and ( ii ) comparison of the solar flux with the isotropic flux .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]            the previous analyses excluded variations of the cre flux correlated from the sun s direction .",
    "however , due to the effects of the heliospheric magnetic field and the geomagnetic field , a cre signal from the sun could produce a flux excess from a direction shifted with respect to the sun s position .",
    "also , since cres from the sun are expected to be spread over a cone with a finite angular radius , an excess of cres from the sun could induce an anisotropy on a large angular scale .    to investigate this possibility we implemented a more general analysis method , based on spherical harmonics analysis of a fluctuation sky map .",
    "this method was applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to search for anisotropies in the cre flux in the galactic reference frame , while in this paper we adopted the custom coordinates in eq .",
    "[ eq : coord ] derived from the ecliptic reference frame .",
    "the fluctuation sky map was built starting from the real sky map and from the simulated one , which was generated using the randomized data sets .",
    "the analysis was performed on sky maps of the counts integrated above a given energy in order to retain sufficient statistics in each energy bin .",
    "the fluctuation in the @xmath37th pixel is :    @xmath38    the fluctuation sky map is then expanded in the basis of spherical harmonics to obtain the set of coefficients @xmath39 .",
    "the coefficients of the angular power spectrum are given by the variance of the @xmath40 @xmath39 coefficients at each multipole :    @xmath41    each coefficient @xmath42 characterizes the intensity of the fluctuations on an angular scale of @xmath43 . in the case of an isotropic flux ,",
    "each of the coefficients @xmath44 can be seen as a random variable with a true value ( white noise ) given by :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the total number of observed events .",
    "the confidence intervals for the @xmath42 can be evaluated by noting that the random variable @xmath47 follows a @xmath48 distribution .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : powspectra ] the angular power spectra after the subtraction of the white noise contribution @xmath49 are shown for four different minimum energies ( @xmath7 , @xmath13 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "the curves show the @xmath52 and @xmath53 probability intervals assuming the hypothesis of an isotropic cre flux .",
    "all the data points lie within the @xmath52 interval , indicating that the measurements are consistent with the hypothesis of an isotropic cre flux .",
    "hence , we conclude that no preferred cre arrival directions are observed .",
    "we now determine constraints on dm model parameters by comparing our upper limits on solar cre fluxes to the predicted fluxes of the two dm annihilation scenarios considered in ref .",
    "@xcite : ( 1 ) capture of dm particles by the sun via elastic scattering interactions and subsequent annihilation to @xmath54 through an intermediate state @xmath1 , and ( 2 ) capture of dm particles by the sun via inelastic scattering interactions and subsequent annihilation of the captured dm particles outside the sun directly to @xmath54 .",
    "in this case we assume the standard scenario for wimp capture by the sun , namely that dm particles @xmath55 are captured by the sun through elastic scattering interactions and then continue to lose energy through subsequent scatterings , eventually thermalizing and sinking to the core where they annihilate . in general , the only annihilation products which can escape the sun are neutrinos ; photons and charged particle final states are trapped by interactions with the dense matter in the sun .",
    "however , recently scenarios have been proposed in which dm particles annihilate into a light intermediate state @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath56 , with the @xmath1 subsequently decaying to standard model particles ; these models have been suggested to provide a means of explaining an excess in the cre spectrum reported by atic and _ fermi _ and in the positron fraction reported by pamela by dm annihilation or decay @xcite . for the case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath1 are assumed to be able to escape the sun without further interactions , with each @xmath1 decaying to an @xmath54 pair .",
    "if this decay happens outside the surface of the sun , the @xmath54 could reach the earth and may be detectable in the form of an observed excess of cres from the direction of the sun .",
    "the dm particles are assumed to annihilate at rest in the core of the sun , so in the lab frame the energy of the @xmath1 , @xmath57 , is equal to the dm particle mass @xmath58 .",
    "we assume @xmath1 to be a light scalar such that @xmath59 , hence the @xmath1 are relativistic .",
    "the energy of the @xmath1 is described by the parameter @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the relative velocity of the lab frame and the @xmath1 rest frame ( hereafter , the cm frame ) .",

    "both the @xmath62 and @xmath63 have the same energy in the cm frame , parameterized by @xmath64 , where @xmath28 is the electron mass and @xmath65 is the velocity of particle @xmath66 ( the electron or positron ) in the cm frame .",
    "however , in the lab frame the @xmath54 are boosted and so the angular distribution is no longer isotropic , and the energy of an @xmath54 in the lab frame depends on the angle at which it is emitted relative to the direction in which the @xmath1 is traveling . in the lab frame the angle at which the @xmath54 is emitted is denoted @xmath67 ; in the cm frame it is @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath54 are assumed to travel in straight lines and to suffer no energy losses before reaching the detector , i.e. , the effects of magnetic fields are assumed to be negligible .",
    "the flux of @xmath54 per time , area , and energy per cosine of the detector angle from the direction @xmath69 is given by integrating the differential rate of decay of @xmath1 along the line of sight in the direction of @xmath69 , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the distance from the detector in the line - of - sight direction defined by @xmath69 .",

    "that equilibrium is a valid assumption , although we discuss this issue in greater detail when presenting our constraints .",
    "we consider separately the cases of solar capture by spin - independent scattering and spin - dependent scattering .",

    "this only occurs for @xmath54 emitted with very small @xmath67 .",
    "this also leads to an energy dependence of the angular signal : for a given dm scenario , the angular extent of the flux at high energies is smaller than at lower energies .",

    "the jagged shape of the curve reflects the transitions between the energy bins setting the strongest limit .",
    "models above the curves exceed the @xmath106 cl solar cre flux upper limit for the @xmath14 roi in at least one energy bin .",
    "@xcite notes that due to the parker spiral shape of the sun s magnetic field , cres emitted from the sun may be deflected in such a way as to appear to originate from a source displaced by up to @xmath14 from the sun s position .",
    "if we instead consider larger rois centered on the sun in order to accommodate the expected angular distribution of the flux of a displaced source , the constraints derived on the scattering cross - sections would be weakened by @xmath107 using the flux upper limit for the @xmath108 roi , or by a factor of @xmath109 if the @xmath110 roi flux upper limit were used .",
    "the bounds on the scattering cross - sections we derive for @xmath54 final states are significantly below the typical constraints from direct detection experiments , and so we are prompted to examine more closely the validity of our assumption of equilibrium . for the limiting values",
    "we derive on elastic scattering cross - sections , capture and annihilation are effectively in equilibrium assuming an annihilation cross - section consistent with thermal relic dark matter @xmath111 for all values of the decay length @xmath103 considered here .",
    "in particular , for the limiting values of the scattering cross - sections the flux suppression relative to the equilibrium flux for any mass we consider is always less than 3% ( following the standard calculation implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and thus we work under the assumption of equilibrium , noting that there remain uncertainties in the capture rate calculation at the level of a factor of a few ( e.g. , @xcite )",

    "fermi_. however , the constraints we obtained on the elastic scattering cross - sections from the solar cre flux correspond to constraints on the annihilation rate roughly 2 - 4 orders of magnitude stronger than those placed by gamma - ray constraints on fsr .",
    "the strength of the cre limits relative to those from fsr increases for larger @xmath112 .",
    "the relative strength of the constraints derived from the cre flux limits compared to those from the gamma - ray measurements can be attributed in part to the fact that the fsr flux produced by annihilation to @xmath113 is @xmath109 - 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the cre flux .",

    "@xcite were derived using the preliminary _ fermi _ measurement of the solar spectrum which extends only to @xmath114 , while this analysis spans cre energies from @xmath115 to @xmath116 . since the fsr photon spectrum is harder than the measured solar gamma - ray spectrum , the strongest constraints are obtained from the highest energy bin in that analysis . due to the fact that the fsr spectrum associated with the dm mass range considered in this analysis extends substantially higher than @xmath114 , the existing fsr constraints are significantly less competitive than our cre constraints .",

    "@xcite ) , the captured particles will be unable to thermalize and settle to the core , and instead will remain on relatively large orbits . as a result , the density of captured dm particles outside the sun may not be negligible in an idm scenario , and the annihilation of those particles to @xmath54 could thus produce an observable flux of cres from the direction of the sun . while it is not necessary for dm to annihilate primarily to @xmath54 in order to explain the direct detection results ( since direct detection experiments are not sensitive to the dominant annihilation channels ) , leptophilic idm is strongly motivated since it could provide a consistent interpretation of multiple data sets @xcite .",

    "the factor of 2 accounts for the fact that 2 cres are emitted per annihilation of a pair of dm particles .",
    "however , it is also necessary to take into account that cres produced on the surface of the sun opposite to the earth are extremely unlikely to reach the detector , so we assume the flux of cres _",

    "since the region from which the dm - induced flux originates in this scenario is the angular extent of the sun , the @xmath14 roi is more than sufficient to encompass all of the dm signal .    .",
    "models above the curves produce a solar cre flux that exceeds the @xmath106 cl flux upper limit for a @xmath14 roi centered on the sun in one or more energy bins .",
    "[ fig : idmlim],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the predicted flux is mono - energetic , however the finite energy resolution of the lat will result in the observed events being assigned to more than one energy bin . since this may have a non - negligible impact on the derived scattering cross - section limits for dm masses near the energy bin edges , we convolve the predicted signal from each model with the energy resolution of the lat and calculate its flux in each energy bin used in the analysis .",
    "we approximate the energy dispersion of the lat as a gaussian with @xmath143 given by the half - width of the @xmath144 containment window ( see fig .",
    "9 of @xcite ) . for the energy range considered here the energy resolution ranges from @xmath145 to @xmath146 .",
    "the cross - section limit at each mass is obtained from the energy bin providing the strongest constraint .",
    "[ fig : idmlim ] shows the constraints from the solar cre flux upper limits on idm models in the @xmath58-@xmath137 parameter space for three values of @xmath132 .",
    "models in the regions above the curves exceed the @xmath106 cl flux upper limit for the @xmath14 roi in at least one energy bin .",
    "the rounded shape of the curves is due to accounting for the energy resolution of the lat .",
    "these limits exclude the regions of parameter space compatible with the results of dama / libra and cdms ( in addition to several other direct detection experiments ) as determined by ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath147 , for the range of masses accessible to our analysis ( @xmath148 ) , assuming the dominant annihilation channel is @xmath54 .",
    "models consistent with both dama / libra and cdms at 90% cl exist for values of @xmath132 ranging from @xmath149 to @xmath150  @xcite ; for masses from 70  gev to 250 gev the range of allowed scattering cross - sections is from @xmath151 to @xmath152 @xmath153  @xcite .",
    "although the uncertainties in the calculation of the dm fluxes in this scenario are significant , we emphasize that constraining @xmath154 is sufficient to exclude the cross - sections of models consistent with both data sets .",
    "the bounds we derive exclude the relevant cross - sections by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude , and hence we conclude that the parameter space of models preferred by dama / libra can be confidently ruled out for @xmath148 for annihilation to @xmath54 despite the uncertainties in the flux calculation .",
    "this analysis constrains dm models in which the primary annihilation channel is to @xmath54 .",
    "we emphasize that although other annihilation channels can be probed by gamma - ray @xcite or neutrino @xcite measurements , the upper limits on solar cre fluxes provide a uniquely strong constraint on the @xmath54 final state , which is inaccessible to neutrino telescopes since no neutrinos are produced for this annihilation channel .",
    "we used a sample of about @xmath155 cre events with energies above @xmath7 detected by the _ fermi _",
    "lat during its first year of data - taking to search for flux excesses or deficits correlated with the sun s direction .",
    "two analysis approaches were implemented , and neither yielded evidence of an enhancement in the cre flux from the direction of the sun .",
    "this result agrees with the more general one shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , where no evidence of anisotropies was found in cre arrival directions above @xmath7 in the galactic reference frame .",
    "we derived limits on dm models which generate a cre flux from the sun s direction for the two scenarios discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case of annihilation of dm through an intermediate state and subsequent decay to @xmath54 , the upper limits on solar cre fluxes provide significantly stronger constraints on the dm scattering cross - section than limits previously derived by constraining the fsr emission associated with this decay channel using solar gamma - ray measurements . for the idm scenario , the solar cre flux",
    "upper limits exclude the range of models which can reconcile the data from dama / libra and cdms for @xmath156 , assuming dm annihilates predominantly to @xmath54",
    ". since direct detection experiments are not sensitive to the dominant annihilation channels of the dm particles , other data , e.g. , solar gamma - ray measurements and neutrino searches , may be able to further constrain these models by excluding regions of parameter space for alternative annihilation channels .",
