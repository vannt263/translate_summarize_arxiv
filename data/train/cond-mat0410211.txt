    "more recently , a kind of artificial composite metamaterials ( so - called _ left - handed media _ or _ negative refractive index media _ ) having a frequency band where the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability are simultaneously negative attracts considerable attention of many researchers in various fields such as materials science , condensed matter physics , optics and classical applied electromagnetism @xcite . it can be readily verified that the left - handed media exhibit a number of peculiar electromagnetic and optical properties , including reversals of both the doppler shift and cherenkov radiation , anomalous refraction and amplification of evanescent wave . in experiments , a combination of two structures ( _ array of long metallic wires _ and _ split ring resonators _ @xcite ) yields such a type of artificial negative refractive index media @xcite .",
    "although veselago s original paper @xcite and most of the recent theoretical works investigated mainly the electromagnetic and optical properties in the _ isotropic _ left - handed media@xcite , up to now , the left - handed media that have been prepared successfully experimentally are actually _ anisotropic _ in nature , and it may be very difficult to prepare an isotropic left - handed medium @xcite . in the previous experimental and theoretical work , investigators used classical optical approaches to design and fabricate the negative refractive index materials@xcite . in the present paper , we will suggest an alternative method ( quantum optical approach ) to realize the negative refractive index : specifically , under certain conditions , the electric - dipole and magnetic - dipole transitions in a multilevel eit ( electromagnetically induced transparency ) atomic system will exhibit simultaneously negative permittivity and negative permeability . recently , many theoretical and experimental investigations show that the control of phase coherence in multilevel atomic ensembles will give rise to many novel and striking quantum optical phenomena in the wave propagation of near - resonant light@xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting phenomena is electromagnetically induced transparency@xcite .",
    "more recently , some unusual physical effects associated with eit observed experimentally include the ultraslow light pulse propagation , superluminal light propagation , light storage in atomic vapor and atomic ground state cooling , some of which are believed to be useful for the development of new techniques in quantum optics@xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will consider a new property of atomic media , _ i.e. _ , the possibility for the eit media to become the left - handed media under some conditions . consider a @xmath0-type three - level atomic ensemble with one upper level @xmath1 and two lower levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "such an atomic system interacts with two optical fields , _",
    "i.e. _ , the coupling laser and the probe laser , which couple the level pairs @xmath1-@xmath3 and @xmath1-@xmath2 , respectively . here",
    "we assume that the coupling laser is in resonance with the @xmath1-@xmath3 transition , while the probe laser has a frequency detuning @xmath4 that is defined by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the @xmath1-@xmath2 transition frequency and the probe mode frequency , respectively .",
    "note that since the level pairs @xmath1-@xmath3 and @xmath1-@xmath2 can be coupled to two laser fields , the parity of level @xmath1 is different from both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "if , for example , @xmath1 possess an odd parity , @xmath2 and @xmath3 will have even parity .",
    "thus , the electric dipole matrix elements @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and the magnetic dipole matrix elements @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the operators of the orbital angular momentum and spin of electrons , respectively .",
    "so , it is possible for the nearly resonant probe laser to cause the electric - dipole transition between levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the magnetic - dipole transition between levels @xmath3 and @xmath2 in the three - level atomic medium .",
    "the electric - dipole transition ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) and the magnetic - dipole transition ( @xmath3-@xmath2 ) will yield the electric polarizability and the magnetic susceptibility at probe frequency , respectively . in general , the dimensionless ratio @xmath14 in an atomic system , where @xmath15 denotes the speed of light in a vacuum . for this reason , the magnetic - dipole transition may not be considered in the treatment for the wave propagation in an artificially electromagnetic material . however , in a three - level eit medium where the intensity of coupling laser is much larger than that of the probe light , the population in level @xmath3 is much greater than that in the upper level @xmath1 . in other words , the stronger coupling laser enhances the probability amplitude of level @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the order of magnitude of the density matrix element @xmath16 may be larger than that of @xmath17 .",
    "this , therefore , means that the magnetic dipole moment ( @xmath18 ) may possibly have the same order of magnitude of the electric dipole moment ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "further analysis shows that such an eit medium may exhibit negative permittivity and permeability , and will therefore become an ideal candidate for realizing isotropic left - handed media .",
    "we should first consider the steady density matrix elements of this eit .",
    "the density matrix elements , @xmath17 and @xmath16 , of such a three - level system can be rewritten as @xmath20 and @xmath21 $ ] . here",
    ", we assume that the intensity of the probe laser is sufficiently weak and therefore nearly all the atoms remain in the ground state , _ i.e. _ , the atomic population in level @xmath2 is unity . under this assumption ,",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfy the following matrix equation @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the spontaneous decay rate of level @xmath1 and the dephasing rate ( nonradiative decay rate ) of @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the electric dipole matrix element , the probe field envelope and the rabi frequency of coupling laser ( @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the electric field strength of the coupling laser ) .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath33    as to the problem of local field correction , here , in the simplest case ( valid for gases ) , we can take the local field to be the same as the macroscopic field ( average field in the sample ) .",
    "so , we need not consider the clausius - mossotti - lorentz relation @xcite . in a three - level atomic system ,",
    "the electric polarizability @xmath34 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath35 are of the form @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , where @xmath38 denotes the atomic density ( total number of atoms per volume ) .",
    "thus , with the help of the steady solution ( [ steadysolution ] ) , one can obtain the relative permittivity @xmath39 and the relative permeability @xmath40 of the above atomic system . by using the relation @xmath41 between the envelopes of magnetic and electric fields",

    "\\label{expressions2}\\ ] ] in an eit left - handed medium , if @xmath34 has a very small imaginary part , the parameter @xmath44 will be an imaginary number .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ expressions2 ] ) that if @xmath45 , the magnetic permeability @xmath46 will have a negative real part and a nearly vanishing imaginary part .",
    "further analysis shows that both the negative and the positive roots ( @xmath47 ) of the magnetic susceptibility are valid for eqs .",
    "( [ expressions ] ) .    in the following section",
    ", we will find out a frequency band in which the three - level eit atomic gas will exhibit simultaneously negative electric permittivity and magnetic permeability .",
    "in order to find out the conditions for realizing the negative optical indices , we should first analyze the real and imaginary parts of the electric polarizability @xmath34 in eqs .",
    "( [ expressions2 ] ) . set @xmath48 . then by the aid of eq .",

    "this requires that the imaginary part @xmath50 is negligibly small ( or @xmath51 ) . in an ordinary eit experiment , the rabi frequency , @xmath29 , of the coupling laser",
    "often has the same order of magnitude of @xmath25 , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath52 s@xmath53@xcite .",
    "thus , it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ parts ] ) that for a low - absorption eit medium , the frequency detuning of the probe field should be much less than the rabi frequency of the coupling laser , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath54 . to achieve the negative electric permittivity , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath55 , according to eqs . (",
    "[ parts ] ) , the quantities @xmath4 , @xmath29 , @xmath25 , @xmath27 and @xmath38 should agree with the following restriction condition @xmath56 with @xmath57 . since @xmath58 , one can ignore the @xmath59 term in inequality ( [ inequality ] ) , and then obtain @xmath60 from the inequality ( [ inequality ] ) .",
    "thus , the requirement for the realization of negative permittivity ( @xmath61 ) near the probe frequency in a three - level atomic system is @xmath62 .",
    "it should be noted that the condition @xmath63 imposes a restriction on the atomic number density @xmath38 of the eit medium , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath64 .",
    "this , therefore , means that in order to realize the low - absorption negative permittivity , one should choose the dense - gas eit media .",
    "for a rough discussion , we choose the values for the dipole matrix elements and decay rates , which are typical for transitions in hyperfine - split na d lines@xcite : @xmath65 d , @xmath66 s@xmath53 . in this case , @xmath67 m@xmath68s@xmath53 .",
    "if the rabi frequency of coupling laser takes the value of @xmath69 s@xmath53@xcite , the detuning @xmath4 of the probe laser should be larger than @xmath70 m@xmath71s@xmath53 in accordance with the condition @xmath72 , and then the eit medium will exhibit a negative permittivity . as far as the low absorption is concerned , the atomic number density @xmath38 should be much larger than @xmath73 m@xmath71 , according to the requirement @xmath74 . as an illustrative example , here we are concerned only with the case of the large negative permittivity ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath75 ) . in this case , @xmath76 .",
    "this , therefore , means that the restriction for realizing the negative permeability can be rewritten as @xmath77 .",
    "note that in an atomic system , @xmath78 .",
    "if we choose @xmath79 , for a tentative consideration , the above condition can be rewritten as @xmath80 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath81 m@xmath68s@xmath53 .    in conclusion , for a typical eit experiment in which @xmath82 s@xmath53 , in order to obtain the negative permittivity , the frequency detuning @xmath4 of the probe laser should satisfy @xmath83 m@xmath71s@xmath53 ; in order to obtain the negative permeability , @xmath4 should satisfy @xmath84 m@xmath68s@xmath53 ; in order to obtain the low absorption for the probe light , the two requirements @xmath85 and @xmath86 m@xmath71 should be satisfied .",
    "thus , it is shown that only when the three - level atomic system is dense gas , the atomic density @xmath38 of which is larger than @xmath87 m@xmath71 and the frequency detuning @xmath4 is approximately or less than @xmath88 s@xmath53 will such a three - level eit medium exhibit a low - absorption negative optical refractive index .",
    "the behaviors of permittivity , permeability and absorption for the probe laser are shown in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "we proposed a novel scheme of eit - based realization of left - handed media .",
    "such a scenario of achieving the negative refractive index with eit atomic gas may have three main advantages : + ( i ) can realize the _ isotropic _",
    "left - handed media ; + ( ii ) can lead to a controllable manipulation of negative refractive index by an external field ( the coupling laser ) ; + ( iii ) can obtain the visible and infrared frequency band where the permittivity and the permeability are simultaneously negative .",
    "for these reasons , we think that the present scheme for realizing the eit left - handed media deserves further investigation both theoretically and experimentally .",
