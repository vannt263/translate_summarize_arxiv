    "knowledge of the stellar mass in galaxies is important for a wide range of science problems . the best way to determine",
    "the stellar mass is through examination of the stellar populations , from either a star - by - star census or spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting of luminosities and colors based on stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models .",
    "however , frequently , such data are not available , and we turn instead to a mass - to - light ratio , @xmath1 , coupled with information on the luminosity or surface brightness , to derive a stellar mass or mass density .",
    "many studies have explored various calibrations of @xmath1 to color relations ( mlcrs ) for johnson - cousins optical bands ( bell & de jong 2001 ; portinari et al.2004 , hereafter p+04 ; mcgaugh & schombert 2014 , hereafter ms14 ) , for sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) optical filters @xcite , and even some for both sets of filters ( bell et al.2003 , hereafter b+03 ; gallazzi & bell 2009 ; zibetti et al.2009 , hereafter z+09 ; into & portinari 2013 , hereafter ip13 ) . in particular , ms14 tested the self - consistency of mlcrs by applying relations from various studies ( b+03 , p+04 , z+09 , ip13 ) and various bands ( specifically @xmath1 in @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and 3.6  @xmath6 m all as functions of @xmath7 ) to estimate masses for a sample of disk galaxies spanning over 10 mag in luminosity .",
    "they found reasonable agreement between the four studies in @xmath3 , but determined revised mlcrs for @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and 3.6  @xmath6 m to improve self - consistency .    for a large sample of galaxies from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and the sdss ,",
    "b+03 used models to construct linear fits of @xmath8 and sdss colors as well as @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "the fits take the form : @xmath10 from there , one can go on , for example , to determine the stellar mass density profile , @xmath11 , from the surface brightness , @xmath6 , and color profiles using the following from @xcite : @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the absolute magnitude of the sun at wavelength @xmath14 and @xmath15 is measured in @xmath16  pc@xmath17 .    however , a reliable relation between some color and the @xmath1 is essential , and the mlcrs in the literature have largely been determined from models appropriate for spirals .",
    "it is questionable if any of these linear fits is suitable for dwarf galaxies , with lower metallicities and potentially different star formation histories ( sfhs ) than spirals .",
    "therefore , we have determined relations between @xmath1 and colors for dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxies .",
    "these relations , presented here , are based on empirical sed fitting of multi - wavelength surface photometry of a sample of 34 dirrs @xcite . in  [ sec - data ]",
    "we describe the data on which our new mlcrs are based . in  [ sec - formula ] we present our mlcrs between stellar @xmath1 from the sed fitting and @xmath18 colors and compare them to several mlcrs from the literature .",
    "we explore metallicity effects in  [ sec - zbins ] by breaking our data into four metallicity bins .",
    "the sample of galaxies is taken from little things ( local irregulars that trace luminosity extremes , the h@xmath19i  nearby galaxy survey , * ? ? ?",
    "this is a multi - wavelength survey of 41 nearby ( @xmath20 mpc ) dirr galaxies and blue compact dwarfs , which builds on the things project @xcite , whose emphasis was on nearby spirals .",
    "the little things galaxies were chosen to be gas - rich so they have the potential to form stars , although a few do not currently have h@xmath21  emission . they were also chosen to be fairly isolated , or at least not companions to a giant galaxy or obviously interacting with another system .",
    "the little things data set includes _ galaxy evolution explorer _ satellite ( _ galex _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) images at fuv ( 1516  ) and nuv ( 2267  ) wavelengths , @xmath0 and some @xmath22 images from @xcite , h@xmath21  images from @xcite , and _",
    "infrared array camera ( * ? ? ?",
    "* irac ) 3.6 @xmath6 m images .",
    "this yields 7 - 10 passbands for each galaxy from the fuv to the nir .",
    "@xcite used azimuthally averaged surface photometry in these passbands and performed a sed analysis of each annulus for a subsample of 34 of the little things dwarfs .",
    "they modeled the data with a library of four million different sfhs based on the unpublished 2007 version of galaxev ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) stellar population models and allowing dust extinction , metallicity , and relative star formation rate among different age bins to vary uniformly among physically reasonable ranges .",
    "they used the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) of @xcite and took into account h@xmath21 line emission , but not contamination from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon lines since nebular emission is arguably not important for the normal star - forming dirr galaxies in the optical broadband images that were used .    from the fits to the data , they derived stellar mass surface density distributions for the 34 dirr galaxies .",
    "@xcite used two slightly different methods to determine the mass profile values at outer radii : ( 1 ) applying the @xmath1 from the most distant point where the sed analysis is applicable and ( 2 ) using the 3.6  @xmath6 m light for some of the outermost points .",
    "we used the latter mass profiles for the 34 dwarfs in our averaging analysis .",
    "the sed fitting analysis yielded robust mass profiles as a function of radius in a large sample of dwarf galaxies . @xcite and @xcite have determined surface brightness and color profiles for these same galaxies , as well as 107 other dwarfs .",
    "with these data , we have the information we need to determine @xmath1 trends with @xmath23 and @xmath7 colors , as well as the transformed color @xmath24 ( using @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 from smith et al.2002 ) , that are appropriate specifically for dirrs .",

    "the relations between @xmath1 and colors were determined via a minimizing @xmath61 fitting routine @xcite iteratively reweighted to obtain a linear fit that was characteristic of as much of the data as possible , but not overly affected by outlying influential points .",
    "the weights were 1.0 for @xmath62 where @xmath63 was the residual and @xmath64 was the weighted standard deviation , both from each previous fit , and @xmath65 for more discrepant data , following an l1 procedure for non - gaussian residuals .",

    "stellar mass profiles are best calculated using the @xmath7 or @xmath24 relations ; the @xmath1 ratio is not correlated as strongly with @xmath23 or @xmath67 m as with @xmath7 or @xmath24 , as seen by the larger scatter in the two @xmath23 panels of figure  [ m_l ] and the @xmath67 m panel of figure  [ new ] .",
    "this makes sense because redder passbands generally trace the mass better than bluer passbands .",
    "fuv@xmath68nuv colors would not have been useful at all for estimating @xmath1 , though @xmath1 in 3.6  @xmath6 m is not as strongly correlated with @xmath7 as the @xmath1 in @xmath30 or @xmath3 .    since our relations",
    "( and those of z+09 ) are based on a @xcite stellar imf , we have applied zero - point offsets to raise or lower mlcrs determined using other imfs for a better comparison due to having one fewer variable between the different studies .",
    "@xcite ( and b+03 ) used a `` diet '' salpeter imf from 0.1 to 125 m_@xmath69  by modifying the @xmath1 by a factor of 0.7 .",
    "this global factor was equivalent to reducing the contribution from low - mass stars , and was done to bring the absolute normalization of their @xmath1 in line with observational constraints of maximum disks determined from rotation curves of spiral galaxies .",
    "b+03 noted that @xmath8 must be reduced by 0.15 dex to convert from their `` diet '' salpeter imf to a @xcite imf . @xcite specified a similar correction ( -0.093 dex ) to convert from the `` diet '' salpeter imf to a @xcite imf , which we applied to the mlcr of b+03 . since p+04 and ip13 both used kroupa imfs , we added 0.057 dex to adjust to a chabrier imf . to convert to a @xcite imf ,",
    "add a constant of + 0.243 to the right side of equation 1 .",
    "for a @xcite imf , with a shallower imf than salpeter for low mass stars , subtract 0.057 dex .",
    "with all the literature mlcrs adjusted ( as needed ) to a chabrier imf , the b+03 optical relations almost overlap our linear fits and the data , except our optical fits for the mlcrs of dirrs are consistently slightly shallower .",
    "actually , each cyan line ( the dwarf best fit ) in figure  [ m_l ] has the _ shallowest _ slope of all the colored lines in each panel , and correspondingly column  5 ( dwarf @xmath70 slopes ) of table  1 contains the smallest slope in each of the first six rows . the z+09 mlcrs provide a poor fit to our dirr galaxy data for all five bands in the comparison .",
    "the p+04 mlcrs are slightly high for all three @xmath7 panels whereas the ip13 mlcrs fit the dwarf data in the @xmath7 panels fairly well ( except for being too steep ) but fall below the dwarf data in both transformed @xmath24 panels .",
    "the dwarf fit values for @xmath71 as a function of @xmath24 ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) are similar to those used by @xcite for their spiral analysis ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) although the latter @xmath76 becomes @xmath49 after being adjusted from the `` diet '' salpeter imf to a chabrier imf .",
    "the magenta asterisks in the lower central ( @xmath7 , @xmath3 ) panel of figure  [ m_l ] show @xmath77 for a single starburst population of 0.1 - 100 @xmath16 stars @xcite reduced by 0.243  dex to adjust the data from their original salpeter imf to a chabrier imf .",
    "interestingly , the dwarf data fall somewhere between the 1  gyr ( @xmath789 ) and 10  gyr ( @xmath7810 ) points since the typical luminosity - weighted age of dirrs is @xmath791  gyr whereas spirals are generally older than dwarfs in terms of their luminosity - weighted ages .",
    "figure  [ fit_params ] displays the fit parameters ( @xmath80-intercepts , @xmath81 , and slopes , @xmath70 ) of the mlcrs from this work as well as those from b+03 , p+04 , z+09 , and ip13 .",
    "the left panel shows the fit parameters from each study with the b+03 data based on the `` diet '' salpeter imf , the p+04 and ip13 data based on a kroupa imf , and the data from this work and z+09 based on a chabrier imf .",
    "the non - dwarf @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 data are directly from table 2 of ms14 .",
    "the right panel shows the @xmath82 @xmath80-intercepts adjusted as needed to a chabrier imf ( the cyan and green data points are unchanged ) and the @xmath4 and 3.6  @xmath6 m fits from table 7 of ms14 , revised to be self - consistent with the @xmath3 band masses and corrected for @xmath83 as a second color term in addition to a 3.6  @xmath6 m data point for dwarfs .",
    "the @xmath84 and 3.6  @xmath6 m fits are all with respect to @xmath7 ; that is , they are of the form : @xmath85 whereas the @xmath86 fits are with respect to @xmath24 . in this work",
    "only , all @xmath86 data have been transformed from @xmath87 images . for completeness",
    ", we have included @xmath88 mlcrs from the literature in figure  [ fit_params ] even though the little things survey does not have enough observations in these bands for us to determine @xmath88 mlcrs for dwarfs .",
    "the optical bands ( but not the @xmath5 or 3.6  @xmath6 m data ) in both panels display a fairly smooth progression from steep slopes and most negative @xmath80-intercepts in @xmath30 ( triangles , lower right ) up to more shallow slopes and less negative @xmath80-intercepts in @xmath47 ( circles ) and @xmath4 ( open diamonds , both in the upper middle ) .",
    "however , in the right panel , the data points are more streamlined and the @xmath4-band points are all located in the upper middle instead of paralleling the @xmath30 to @xmath47 points in the left panel . furthermore , within each optical band , the shape obtained from connecting the data from lower right to upper left follows roughly the same pattern from z+09 ( green ) , ip13 ( lavender ) , b+03 ( pink ) , this work ( cyan ) , to p+04 ( gold ) .",
    "the differences between the various studies probably occur due to the variety of sample galaxy sfhs or assumed sfhs since sed masses and luminosities depend strongly on sfhs .",
    "why do the coefficients @xmath81 , the @xmath80-intercepts , and @xmath70 , the slopes , vary systematically with each other and with wavelength ?",
    "the fact that @xmath81 decreases ( the @xmath1 gets smaller ) when @xmath70 increases ( the color dependence gets stronger ) for bluer passbands means that younger regions with small @xmath1s have a greater dependence between @xmath1 and @xmath7 color than older regions .",
    "this must occur since all the mlcr lines in figure  1 have similar @xmath1 at the reddest colors .",
    "that is , if we think of @xmath1 versus @xmath7 as pinned at a particular @xmath1 for a particular large @xmath7 , and all the other curves varying as straight lines around that pinning point , then naturally the @xmath80-intercept @xmath81 will get smaller as the slope @xmath70 gets larger .",
    "physically this means that for red colors , the imf and sfhs do not matter much because only old red stars remain and the @xmath1 and colors are universal for very old populations .",
    "the variety of sed models and galaxy fits is generally due to different histories or assumptions about _ young _ stars .",
    "since our mlcrs for dwarfs are shallower than the mlcrs in the literature and a lower metallicity is one characteristic that separates dwarfs from spirals , we broke our dwarf data into four bins based on oxygen abundance ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 ) and fit the mlcr for each bin .",
    "figure  [ z_params ] shows the results , including an apparent steepening of the mlcrs with higher metallicity ( see table  [ tab - z ] for the fit parameters ) but little metallicity dependence of the @xmath80-intercepts , especially in @xmath42 and @xmath47 . since the @xmath42 and @xmath47 analyses are not based on images but instead on transformations of @xmath30 and @xmath3 , it is not surprising that the @xmath42 and @xmath47 fits have similar slopes to the @xmath30 and @xmath3 fits .",
    "unfortunately , the metallicities of the samples of spiral galaxies explored to determine existing mlcrs are not available for comparison .",
    "however , for our slope trends from the left panel of figure  [ z_params ] to match the b+03 mlcr slopes , the metallicity for the spiral sample would need to be somewhere between 8.5 and 8.8 , which might be reasonable for a galaxy - wide average considering that the solar value is 8.69 @xcite . perhaps the shallower slope with lower metallicity is caused by less line blanketing occurring at lower metallicity @xcite .",
    "the color changes with changing line blanketing ( bluer for less line blanketing ) _",
    "faster _ than the brightness ( brighter for less line blanketing ) of a population .",

    "we have used the stellar mass density radial profiles of @xcite produced from sed fitting to 7 - 10 passbands from the fuv to the nir and the surface brightness and color profiles of @xcite to determine relations between @xmath97 and @xmath23 and @xmath7 colors as well as the transformed color @xmath24 given by @xcite .",
    "these mlcrs are specifically for dirr type galaxies .",
    "the @xmath7 relationship in particular can be used to determine stellar masses in dirrs in situations where sed fitting of multi - wavelength photometry or a census of individual stars is not available .",
    "our mlcrs are consistently shallower than those reported in the literature and the differences could be due at least partly to a steepening of mlcrs with metallicity , perhaps from more line blanketing occurring at higher metallicity .",
