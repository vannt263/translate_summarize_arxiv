    "this is very nice since the squark and slepton masses turn out to be of the same order as the gaugino masses , however doing two - loop calculations is quite tedious .",
    "fortunately since we are only interested in the finite parts of two - loop graphs , there is a simple method for doing these calculations using the renormalization group ( rg ) and holomorphy @xcite .      below the mass scale of the messengers we can integrate them out and write the pure gauge part of the lagrangian as : _",
    "g = -i d^2 ( x , ) w^w _  , where the effects of the messengers are included through their effects on the one - loop running of the holomorphic gauge coupling .",
    "taylor expanding in the @xmath42 component of @xmath376 we find a gaugino mass given by m _ & = & i |_x = m f + & = & i |_x = m f  . the holomorphic coupling is given by ( x , ) = ( _ 0 ) + i b^ ( x ) + i b ( )  , where , as usual , @xmath497 is the @xmath184 function coefficient of the theory including the messenger fields and @xmath498 is the @xmath184 function coefficient in the effective theory ( i.e. the mssm ) below the mass scale of the messengers .",
    "these two coefficients are related by : b^= b -n_m  .",
    "so the gaugino mass is simply given by m_= n_m  .",
    "note that in the mssm , where we have three gauginos , the ratio of the gaugino mass to the gauge coupling is universal : = = = n_m  .",
    "this type of relation was originally found in supergravity mediation models and , at the time , was thought to be a signature of such models .",
    "next consider the wavefunction renormalization for the matter fields of the mssm : = d^4 z(x , x^ ) q^ q^  , where @xmath73 must be real and the superscript @xmath499 is meant to indicate that we have not yet canonically normalized the field .",
    "taylor expanding in the superspace coordinate @xmath41 we have & = & d^4 ( z+z f ^2 + z f^^2 + ^2 z f ^2 f^^2)|_x = mq^ q^  .",
    "+ & & canonically",
    "normalizing we have : q = z^1/2 ( 1+z f ^2)|_x = m q^  , so = d^4 |_x = m q^ q. thus we have a sfermion mass term : m_q^2 = - ^2 z|_x = m ff^  . rescaling the matter fields also introduces an @xmath75 term in the effective potential from taylor expanding the superpotential : z^-1/2 z |_x = m f q w  , which is suppressed by a yukawa coupling . to calculate @xmath73",
    ", we do a supersymmetric calculation and replace @xmath26 by @xmath500 . at @xmath501 loops an rg analysis gives z = ( _ 0)^l-1f((_0 ) l_0 , ( _ 0 ) l_x )  , where l_0 = ( ^2 )  , + l_x = ( ^2 )  , so = ( ) ^l+1h ( ( ) l_x )  .",
    "thus the two - loop scalar masses are determined by a one - loop rg equation .",
    "at one - loop we have = c_2(r ) ( )  , so z ( ) = z_0 ( ( _ 0))^2 c_2(r ) ( ( x))^2 c_2(r )  , where ^-1(x)= ^-1(_0 ) + b^ ( x x^ )  , + ^-1()= ^-1(x ) + b ( ^2 )  .",
    "so we finally obtain m_q^2 = 2 c_2(r ) n_m ( ^2 + ( 1-^2))()^2  , where = 1  .",
    "what is particularly impressive about this calculation @xcite is that a two - loop result is obtained from a one - loop calculation .",
    "recall that in order to obtain a viable mass spectrum for the electroweak sector in the mssm , the two higgs doublets , @xmath502 and @xmath503 , needed two types of masses terms : a supersymmetric @xmath1 term : w= h_u h_d  , and a soft susy - breaking @xmath498 term : v= b h_u h_d  , with a peculiar relation between these two seemingly unrelated parameters b ~^2  . in gauge mediated models",
    "we need to be of the same order as the squark and slepton masses : ~1 f  .",
    "if we introduce a coupling of the higgses to the susy breaking field @xmath376 , w= x h_u h_d  , + we get & = & m  , + b&= & f ~16 ^2 ^2  , so @xmath498 is much too large for this type of model to be viable .",
    "a more indirect coupling w= x ( _ 1 _ 1 _ 1 + _ 2 _ 2 _ 2 ) h_u _ 1 _ 2 + h_d  , yields a one - loop correction to the effective lagrangian : = d^4 f(_1/_2 ) h_u h_d x  .",
    "this unfortunately still gives the same , non - viable , ratio for @xmath504 .",
    "the correct ratio can be arranged with the introduction of two additional singlet fields @xmath62 and @xmath130 : w = s(_1 h_u h_d + _ 2 n^2 + -m_n^2 ) + x  , then = _ 1 s  , + b = _ 1 f_s  .",
    "a vev for @xmath62 is generated at one loop s ~1 f_x^2  , but @xmath505 is only generated at two loops : f_s ~1 f_x^2 ~ 1  .",
    "thus we can obtain @xmath506 provided that we arrange for @xmath507 .",
    "so it seems that somewhat elaborate models are needed to solve the @xmath1 problem in the gauge mediated scenario .",
    "non - perturbative susy techniques can be used to understand how to dynamically break gauge symmetries ( like the the gut symmetry of the electroweak gauge symmetry of the standard model ) , however the most important application is to break susy itself .",
    "we would like to have a theory of dynamical breaking so that the susy breaking scale can be naturally much smaller than the planck or string scale without fine - tuning the ratio of these scales by hand .",
    "this is what naturally happens in asymptotically free gauge theories since the coupling at high energies can be perturbative and slowly running and then get strong at some much lower scale .",
    "this is just what happens in qcd : the coupling is perturbative near the ( putative ) unification scale , but gets strong in the ir , producing a large but natural ratio between the gut scale and the proton mass .      a theory that has no flat directions and spontaneously breaks a continuous global symmetry generally breaks susy @xcite .",
    "this is because there must be a goldstone boson ( which has no interactions in the potential ) , and by susy it must have a scalar partner ( a modulus ) , but if there are no flat directions this is impossible .",
    "( unless the modulus is also a goldstone boson . ) in the early days people looked for theories that had no classical flat directions ( assuming that quantum corrections would not cancel the classical potential ) and tried to make them break global symmetries in the perturbative regime .",
    "this method produced a handful of dynamical susy breaking theories .",
    "with duality we can find many examples of dynamical susy breaking .",
    "an important twist is that we will find that non - perturbative quantum effects can lift flat directions both at the origin of moduli space as well as for large vevs .      in the mid 1980s , affleck ,",

    "since the vacuum is driven away from the point where the vevs vanish by the dynamical ads potential ( [ dsb : dynads32 ] ) , the global @xmath15 symmetries are broken and we expect ( by the rule of thumb described above ) that susy is broken .",
