    "one of the challenges of wireless systems is to establish communication under time - varying channel conditions experienced due to mobility and changing environment .",
    "one technique employed in practical systems to cope with this challenge is to periodically send training signals to estimate the channel .",
    "often , the channel estimate is considered as perfect , and transmission and reception is designed for a known channel .",
    "due to its practical significance , training schemes has been studied extensively .",
    "_ in @xcite present an overview of pilot - assisted wireless transmissions and discuss design issues from both information - theoretic and signal processing perspectives .",
    "the information - theoretic approach considers the optimization of training parameters to maximize the achievable data rates .",
    "for instance , hassibi and hochwald @xcite optimized the training data , power , and duration in multiple - antenna wireless links by maximizing a lower bound on the channel capacity .",
    "the general theme in information - theoretic approaches ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) is that training - based transmission schemes are close to being optimal at high signal - to - noise ( @xmath0 ) values but highly suboptimal in the low-@xmath0 regime due to poor channel estimates .",
    "another important concern in wireless communications is the efficient use of limited energy resources . in systems where energy is at a premium , minimizing the energy cost per unit transmitted information",
    "will improve the efficiency .",
    "hence , the energy required to reliably send one bit is a metric that can be adopted to measure the performance . generally , energy - per - bit requirement is minimized , and hence the energy efficiency is maximized , if the system operates in the low-@xmath0 regime @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since training - based schemes perform poorly at low @xmath0s especially if the channel estimate is presumed to be perfect , this immediately calls into question the energy - efficiency of pilot - assisted systems . with this motivation ,",
    "we present in this paper an energy - efficiency perspective on pilot - assisted wireless transmission schemes and seek to answer the question of how low should the @xmath0 be so that the energy efficiency is compromised .",
    "we consider rayleigh block - fading channels where the input - output relationship within a block of @xmath1 symbols is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is used to denote that @xmath4 is a complex gaussian random vector with mean @xmath5 and covariance @xmath6 is a zero - mean circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variable with variance @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a zero - mean , @xmath1 complex - dimensional gaussian random vector ) , @xmath9 , @xmath4 , and @xmath8 are column vectors . ] with covariance matrix @xmath10 . @xmath4 and @xmath9 are the @xmath1 complex - dimensional channel input and output vectors respectively . the input is subject to an average power constraint @xmath11 it is assumed that the fading coefficients stay constant for a block of @xmath1 symbols and have independent realizations for each block .",
    "it is further assumed that neither the transmitter nor the receiver has prior knowledge of the realizations of the fading coefficients .",
    "we assume that pilot symbols are employed in the system to facilitate channel estimation at the receiver .",
    "hence , the system operates in two phases , namely training and data transmission . in the training phase",
    ", pilot symbols known at the receiver are sent from the transmitter and the received signal is @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are @xmath16-dimensional vectors signifying the fact that @xmath16 out of @xmath1 input symbols are devoted to training .",
    "it is assumed that the receiver employs minimum mean - square error ( mmse ) estimation to obtain the estimate @xmath17 with this estimate , the fading coefficient can now be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 following the training phase , the transmitter sends the ( @xmath20)-dimensional data vector @xmath21 and the receiver equipped with the knowledge of the channel estimate operates on the received signal @xmath22 to recover the transmitted information .",
    "our overall goal is to identify the bit energy values that can be attained with optimized training parameters such as the power and duration of pilot symbols .",
    "the least amount of energy required to send one information bit reliably is given by is the bit energy normalized by the noise power spectral level @xmath23 . ]",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the channel capacity in bits / symbol . in general , it is difficult to obtain a closed - form expression for the capacity of the channel ( [ eq : dataphasemodel ] ) .",
    "therefore , we consider a lower bound on the channel capacity by assuming that @xmath26 is a gaussian noise vector that has a covariance of @xmath27 and is uncorrelated with the input signal @xmath21 . with this assumption ,",
    "the channel model becomes @xmath28 this model is called the worst - case scenario since the channel estimate is assumed to be perfect , and the noise is modeled as gaussian , which presents the worst case @xcite .",
    "the capacity of the channel in ( [ eq : worstcasemodel ] ) , which acts as a lower bound on the capacity of the channel in ( [ eq : dataphasemodel ] ) , is achieved by a gaussian input with @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the optimal fraction of the power allocated to the pilot symbol , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "the optimal value is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 note that @xmath0 in ( [ eq : eta+snr ] ) is the received signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "in the average power limited case , sending a single pilot is optimal because instead of increasing the number of pilot symbols , a single pilot with higher power can be used and a decrease in the duration of the data transmission can be avoided .",
    "hence , the optimal @xmath21 is an ( @xmath34)-dimensional gaussian vector . since the above results are indeed special cases of those in @xcite , the details are omitted . the resulting capacity expression . ]",
    "is @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note also that the expectation in ( [ eq : worstcap ] ) is with respect to the random variable @xmath37 .",
    "the bit energy values in this setting are given by @xmath38 @xmath39 provides the least amount of normalized bit energy values in the worst - case scenario and also serves as an upper bound on the achievable bit energy levels of channel ( [ eq : dataphasemodel ] ) .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that if the channel estimate is assumed to be perfect , and gaussian codebooks designed for known channels are used , and scaled nearest neighbor decoding is employed at the receiver , then the generalized mutual information has an expression similar to ( [ eq : worstcap ] ) ( see ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.0.1 ) ) .",
    "hence @xmath39 also gives a good indication of the energy requirements of a system operating in this fashion .",
    "the next result provides the asymptotic behavior of the bit energy as @xmath0 decreases to zero .",
    "the fact that @xmath49 decreases as @xmath50 as @xmath0 goes to zero has already been pointed out in @xcite .",
    "lemma [ lemma : bitenergylow ] shows the impact of this behavior on the energy - per - bit , and indicates that it is extremely energy - inefficient to operate at very low @xmath0 values .",
    "we further conclude that in a training - based scheme where the channel estimate is assumed to be perfect , the minimum energy per bit is achieved at a finite and nonzero @xmath0 value .",
    "this most energy - efficient operating point can be obtained by numerical analysis .",
    "we can easily compute @xmath51 in ( [ eq : worstcap ] ) , and hence the bit energy values , using the gauss - laguerre quadrature integration technique .",
    "figure [ fig : trainingbitenergy ] plots the normalized bit energy curves as a function of @xmath0 for block lengths of @xmath52 .",
    "as predicted , for each block length value , the minimum bit energy is achieved at nonzero @xmath0 , and the bit energy requirement increases as @xmath42 .",
    "it is been noted in @xcite that training - based schemes , which assume the channel estimate to be perfect , perform poorly at very low @xmath0 values , and the exact transition point below which one should not operate in this fashion is deemed as not clear .",
    "here , we propose the @xmath0 level at which the minimum bit energy is achieved as a transition point since operating below this point results in higher bit energy requirements .",
    "another observation from fig .",
    "[ fig : trainingbitenergy ] is that the minimum bit energy decreases with increasing @xmath1 and is achieved at a lower @xmath0 value .",
    "the following result sheds a light on the asymptotic behavior of the capacity as @xmath53 .",
    "_ proof _ : we have @xmath57 ( [ eq : asymp2 ] ) holds due to integrable upper bound @xmath58 and the dominated convergence theorem .",
    "( [ eq : derivative ] ) follows again from the application of the dominated convergence theorem and the fact that the derivative of @xmath59 with respect to @xmath55 at @xmath60 is @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath48    the first part of theorem [ prop : asympcap ] is not surprising and is expected because reference @xcite has already shown that as the block length grows , the perfect knowledge capacity is achieved even if no channel estimation is performed .",
    "this result agrees with our observation in fig .",
    "[ fig : trainingbitenergy ] that @xmath62 db is approached at lower snr values as @xmath1 increases . however , the rate of approach is very slow in terms of the block size , as proven in the second part of theorem [ prop : asympcap ] and evidenced in fig .",
    "[ fig : minbit_vs_m ] . due to the infinite slope implies that the slope of @xmath63 at @xmath64 is @xmath65 . ]",
    "observed in the figure , approaching @xmath62db is very demanding in block length .",
    "one approach to improve the energy efficiency in the low @xmath0 regime is to increase the peak power of the transmitted signals .",
    "this can be achieved by transmitting @xmath66 fraction of the time with power @xmath67 .",
    "note that training also needs to be performed only @xmath66 fraction of the time .",
    "this type of training and communication , called flash transmission scheme , is analyzed in @xcite where it is shown that the minimum bit energy of @xmath62db can be achieved if the block length @xmath1 increases at a certain rate as @xmath0 decreases . in the setting we consider ,",
    "flash transmission scheme achieves the following rate : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the duty cycle which in general is a function of the @xmath0 .",
    "first , we show that flash transmission using peaky gaussian signals does not improve the minimum bit energy .",
    "_ proof _ : note that for any @xmath0 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is defined as the new @xmath0 level .",
    "since the inequality in ( [ eq : flashineq ] ) holds for any @xmath0 and @xmath70 , it also holds for the infimum of the left - hand side of ( [ eq : flashineq ] ) , and hence the result follows .",
    "@xmath48            _ proof _ : we first note that by jensen s inequality , @xmath81 first , we consider category 1 . in this case , as @xmath42 , @xmath82 . as shown before",
    ", the logarithm in ( [ eq : cappercostupperbound ] ) scales as @xmath83 as @xmath42 , and hence @xmath84 scales as @xmath85 leading to @xmath86 in category 2 , @xmath85 grows to infinity as @xmath42 .",
    "since the @xmath87 function on the right hand side of ( [ eq : cappercostupperbound ] ) increases only logarithmically as @xmath88 , we can easily verify that @xmath86 in category 3 , @xmath72 decreases at the same rate as @xmath0 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath89 ( [ eq : categ12 ] ) is justified by invoking the dominated convergence theorem and noting the integrable upper bound @xmath90 the above upper bound is given in the proof of theorem [ prop : asympcap ] . finally , ( [ eq : categ13 ] ) follows from the continuity of the logarithm .",
    "@xmath48    theorem [ prop : flashbitenergy ] shows that if the rate of the decrease of the duty cycle is faster or slower than @xmath0 as @xmath42 , the bit energy requirement still increases without bound in the low-@xmath0 regime .",
    "this observation is tightly linked to the fact that the capacity curve @xmath49 has a zero slope as both @xmath42 and @xmath91 . for",
    "improved performance in the low-@xmath0 regime , it is required that the duty cycle scale as @xmath0 .",
    "a particularly interesting choice is @xmath92 where @xmath93 is equal to the @xmath0 level at which the minimum bit energy is achieved in a non - flashy transmission scheme .",
    "[ fig : flashbitenergy ] plots the normalized bit energy @xmath39 as a function of @xmath0 for block size @xmath94 .",
    "the minimum bit energy is achieved at @xmath95 . for @xmath96 ,",
    "flash transmission is employed with @xmath97 .",
    "as observed in the figure , the minimum bit energy level can be maintained for lower values of @xmath0 at the cost of increased peak - to - average power ratio .",
    "heretofore , we have assumed that there are no peak power constraints imposed on either the data or pilot symbols .",
    "recall that the power of the pilot symbol is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "we immediately observe from ( [ eq : pilotpower ] ) that the pilot power increases at least as @xmath100 as @xmath1 increases .",
    "for large block sizes , such an increase in the pilot power may be prohibitive in practical systems .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to impose a peak power constraint on the pilot in the following form : @xmath101 and is at most @xmath102 for any block size .",
    "therefore , @xmath103 can be seen as a limitation on the peak - to - average power ratio .",
    "note that we will allow gaussian signaling for data transmission .",
    "hence , there are no hard peak power limitations on data signals .",
    "this approach will enable us to work with a closed - form capacity expression .",
    "although gaussian signals can theoretically assume large values , the probability of such values is decreasing exponentially .",
    "if the optimal power allocated to a single pilot exceeds @xmath104 , i.e. , @xmath105 , the peak power constraint on the pilot becomes active . in this case , more than just a single pilot may be needed for optimal performance .    in this section",
    ", we address the optimization of the number of pilot symbols when each pilot symbol has fixed power @xmath106 .",
    "if the number of pilot symbols is @xmath107 , then @xmath108 and , as we know from section [ sec : trainingscheme ] , @xmath109 similarly as before , when the estimate error is assumed to be another source of additive noise and overall additive noise is assumed to be gaussian , the input - output mutual information achieved by gaussian signaling is given by @xmath110 where @xmath36 and @xmath111    the optimal value of the training duration @xmath16 that maximizes @xmath112 can be obtained through numerical optimization .",
    "[ fig : ptrainingbitenergy ] plots the normalized bit energy values @xmath113 in db obtained with optimal training duration for different block lengths .",
    "the peak power constraint imposed on a pilot symbol is @xmath114 .",
    "[ fig : noofpilots ] gives the optimal number of pilot symbols per block . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ptrainingbitenergy ] , we observe that the minimum bit energy , which is again achieved at a nonzero value of the @xmath0 , decreases with increasing block length and approaches to the fundamental limit of @xmath62db .",
    "we note from fig .",
    "[ fig : noofpilots ] that the number pilot symbols per block increases as the block length increases or as @xmath0 decreases to zero . when there are no peak constraints , @xmath115 as @xmath42 .",
    "hence , we need to allocate approximately half of the available total power @xmath116 to the single pilot signal in the low - power regime , increasing the peak - to - average power ratio . in the limited peak power case , this requirement is translated to the requirement of more pilot symbols per block at low @xmath0 values .",
    "table [ table : minbitenergy ] lists , for different values @xmath1 , the minimum bit energy values , the required number of pilot symbols at this level , and the @xmath0 at which minimum bit energy is achieved .",
