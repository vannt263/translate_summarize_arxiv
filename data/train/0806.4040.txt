    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite has measured the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , and parameters characterizing the standard big bang cosmology have been deduced  @xcite from these data . for the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath12 deduced from fits to the cmb , the bbn model predicts abundances of the light elements except for @xmath6li and @xmath7li which are more - or - less consistent with those inferred from astronomical observations .",
    "spectroscopic lithium abundances have been detected in the atmospheres of metal poor stars .",
    "nearly constant abundances of @xmath6li and @xmath7li in metal - poor population ii ( pop  ii ) stars have been inferred .",
    "there is about a factor of three under - abundance of @xmath7li in metal - poor halo stars ( mphss ) with respect to the sbbn prediction when using the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath12 .",
    "this is called the @xmath7li problem  @xcite . in addition ,",
    "spectroscopic measurements obtained with high resolution indicate that mphss have a very large abundance of @xmath6li , i.e.  at a level of about 3 orders of magnitude larger than the sbbn prediction of the @xmath6li abundance , which is called the @xmath6li problem  @xcite .",
    "cayrel et al .",
    "@xcite studied line asymmetries to be generated by convective doppler shifts in stellar atmospheres , and found that the convective asymmetry might mimic the presence of @xmath6li and an error of @xmath6li/@xmath7li amounts to a few percent that is roughly comparable to the values estimated from mphss .",
    "the @xmath6li problem , therefore , may not exist in fact , since the convective asymmetry could give a possible solution to the @xmath6li problem within the framework of sbbn .",
    "the possibility of @xmath6li production in non - standard bbn triggered by the decay of unstable relic neutral massive particles @xmath13 has been studied  @xcite .",
    "several critical constraints on the properties of @xmath13 particles were derived from the studies of radiative decay  @xcite , hadronic decay or annihilation  @xcite of @xmath13 particles along with the bbn constraints on the light elements .",
    "these particle decay induces electromagnetic and/or hadronic showers triggering the destruction of preexisting nuclei and the production of different nuclear species .",
    "a recent detailed study  @xcite of the radiative decay and its influence on the @xmath6li production has found a parameter region of lifetime @xmath14  s and abundance parameter @xmath15  gev where the non - thermal nucleosynthesis of @xmath6li can explain the observed abundance level in mphss .",
    "this parameter region satisfies the two observational constraints on the cmb energy spectrum and the primordial light element abundances .",

    "first , @xmath3he and @xmath16 are the seeds for @xmath6li in the processes @xmath0he(@xmath3he,@xmath2)@xmath6li and @xmath0he(@xmath16,@xmath4)@xmath6li .",
    "second , the excess of @xmath6li abundance is therefore regulated by the amounts of @xmath3he and @xmath16 which are produced by the non - thermal photodisintegration of @xmath0he , i.e. @xmath0he(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3h and @xmath0he(@xmath1,@xmath4)@xmath3he . hence , the radiative decay model which results in @xmath6li - production above the mphs abundance level is also reflected by an enhancement of the @xmath3he abundance with respect to the sbbn value .",
    "third , the radiative decay does not resolve the @xmath7li problem  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore concluded that other mechanisms such as the stellar depletion of the lithium isotopes in the atmosphere of mphss  @xcite or new burst of late - time bbn on the exotic @xmath13-bound nuclei in the case of negatively - charged leptonic particles @xmath17  @xcite must operate to lower the @xmath7li abundance .",

    "@xcite at the photon energies 20  mev @xmath18 30  mev .",
    "if these non - thermal photon energies dominate the destruction of @xmath0he , the production of @xmath3he and @xmath16 and also the subsequent production of @xmath6li via @xmath0he(@xmath3he,@xmath2)@xmath6li and @xmath0he(@xmath16,@xmath4)@xmath6li , this would change the parameter region of @xmath19 and @xmath20 of massive relic particles @xmath13 so that the resultant non - thermal nucleosynthesis of @xmath6li can explain the abundance level observed in mphss .",
    "the first purpose of this article is to study the sensitivity of non - thermal bbn of all light elements d , t , @xmath3he , @xmath0he , @xmath6li , @xmath7li and @xmath7be to the photodisintegration cross sections of @xmath0he .",

    "since the energies of the emitted particles are small due to high threshold energies of the photodisintegrations of @xmath21he , many efforts have been devoted to detect those particles clearly from the backgrounds caused by the incident high - energy @xmath1-rays . in the inverse experiments ,",

    "another recent focus of photodisintegration of @xmath0he is on the mechanism of the core - collapse sne .",
    "most sn simulations still do not succeed in the sn explosion in spite of detailed numerical studies of the neutrino transfer calculations inside the core .",
    "haxton  @xcite proposed that the neutrino - induced excitations of @xmath0he and heavier nuclei could deposit extra - energy to the ejected materials and revive the shock wave , which motivated a recent theoretical study on the role of @xmath0he spallation reactions in the core - collapse sne  @xcite .",
