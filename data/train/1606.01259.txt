    "the optical emission line doublet [ oiii]@xmath15  and the recombination line h@xmath0 are diagnostic lines that trace the properties of gas in star - forming regions .",

    "these two diagnostics allow us to measure the metallicity , electron temperature , ionization parameter , and hardness of the radiation field in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of a star - forming galaxy @xcite .",
    "[ oiii]/h@xmath0 is used in the baldwin - phillips - terlevich ( bpt ) diagram @xcite along with [ nii]/h@xmath16 to distinguish between star - forming galaxies , which lie along the hii abundance sequence , and galaxies powered by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) which inhabit a distinct region of bpt parameter space characterized by elevated emission line ratios .",
    "for star - forming galaxies , their exact position on the hii sequence is dependent on the galaxy s metallicity , ionizing radiation field , and ism conditions @xcite .    as rest - frame",
    "optical emission lines are being studied at higher redshifts , it appears that galaxies at @xmath1 exhibit different emission line properties than what is commonly seen in the local universe .",
    "increasingly , it appears that extreme emission line behavior , either very large equivalent widths @xcite or enhanced emission line ratios @xcite , are ubiquitous at higher redshifts .",
    "the physical mechanism driving the observed high emission line ratios remain unclear .",
    "possible culprits include increased electron densities @xcite , harder ionizing radiation fields @xcite , a larger ionization parameter @xcite , increased agn contributions @xcite , shocks @xcite , or a combination thereof .    recently , several studies have suggested that [ oiii]/h@xmath0 correlates with specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) at low and high redshifts .",
    "@xcite have found a correlation between ssfr , ionization parameter , and [ oiii]/h@xmath0 at @xmath17 , and @xcite have shown that star - forming galaxies at @xmath18 have similarly high ssfr and [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratios as a small subset of the sdss star - forming galaxy sample .",
    "additionally , @xcite found that at fixed h@xmath0 luminosity , strong emission line diagnostics in general are not shifted from sdss at high redshift .",
    "it may be possible that we are not witnessing an evolution of the [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratio with redshift , but rather that we are probing a population of galaxies with high ssfr which are rare in the local universe but common at higher redshifts .",
    "a limiting factor is that most @xmath1 surveys do not sample the low - ssfr regime where the majority of sdss galaxies lie ( e.g , * ? ? ?",

    "star formation rates were calculated from the uv+ir luminosities as described in @xcite . in brief , the ir luminosity for each galaxy was converted from the _ spitzer_/mips 24 @xmath28 m flux density with a luminosity - independent template .",

    "we use median rather than mean stacks because while the two methods produce similar ratios in all mass and ssfr bins ( within the derived errors ) , the mean stacks are noisier and badly fit by the continuum models .",

    "the same weighting scheme is applied to the continuum models .",
    "we have chosen this weighting threshold because the snr measurements are unreliable below snr @xmath41 , causing a mismatch between the continuum models and the stacked spectra .",
    "using a larger weighting threshold causes the brightest spectra to dominate the stacks , especially at low ssfr . the median stack and model for a single ssfr bin",

    "finally , the spectra and corresponding models are both normalized by the average continuum ( as measured in the wavelength range 4650 - 4800 and 5100 - 5200  ) and then the model is subtracted from the median spectrum .",
    "this is to account for the effects of stellar balmer absorption , which is especially significant at low ssfrs and high stellar masses .",
    "we find that normalizing by the continuum ( as opposed to [ oiii ] flux , for instance ) is necessary at the lowest ssfr and highest stellar masses , as these stacks have very low amounts of emission .",

    "our local comparison sample is the star - forming galaxy subset of the sdss dr7 dataset , classified as such by @xcite using the @xcite bpt diagram demarcations .",
    "we also show the median , 16th , and 84th percentile [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratios for the sdss sample for ease of comparison to the 3d - hst median stacks .    in agreement with previous studies",
    ", we find that individual galaxies in the 3d - hst sample have [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratios that are significantly elevated above their sdss counterparts at all stellar masses . on average ,",
    "these galaxies have ratios that are @xmath42 dex above the median sdss ratios , in agreement with extant studies ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* shown in figure 3 in blue ) .",
    "the median stacks of 3d - hst galaxies binned by stellar mass show similar behavior on a lesser scale .",
    "we calculate the average offset between the ratios of the stacked galaxies and the median sdss values to be @xmath9 dex .",
    "this offset , while significant , is much smaller than that observed with the individually detected emission line ratios alone , highlighting the important of stacking galaxies below individual detection limits .",
    "additionally , the stacked galaxies show a strong trend of increasing [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratio with decreasing stellar mass , similar to that seen in the local universe , while the individual galaxies display no such trend .",
    "there is a small jump in the median ratios of the 3d - hst stacks at @xmath43 . while we have removed irac - selected agn from our sample , we acknowledge that these results may still be affected by the presence of undetected agn and composite galaxies , which may account for the uptick in [ oiii]/h@xmath0 at @xmath43 .      in figure 4 ,",
    "we show [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratios as a function of the specific star formation rate .",
    "the sdss sample shows a tight correlation between ssfr and line ratio above ssfr @xmath44 .",
    "while the majority of high - redshift galaxies with individual detections do not lie within the 16th-84th percentile bounds of the sdss ratios , there is a subset at ssfr @xmath45 which do .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to figure 3 , where at fixed stellar mass , no @xmath10 galaxy in our sample lies within the same bounds .",
    "however , the individual galaxies in our sample span a very small amount of ssfr space . by median stacking , we are able to measure line ratios at ssfrs a full dex below those of the individual galaxies",
    ".    the line ratios of the median stacks binned by ssfr are strongly correlated with their ssfrs .",
    "most notably , the offset observed between ratios at @xmath12 and @xmath46 at fixed stellar mass is absent in ssfr - space .",
    "we measure the average offset between the median ratios of the two populations to be @xmath47 dex .",
    "the strong ssfr - [ oiii]/h@xmath0 correlation and the apparent lack of evolution in the relation between ssfr and [ oiii]/h@xmath0 across 10 gyr of cosmic time suggest that the ssfr of a star - forming galaxy is intimately connected to its excitation properties , and that this connection does not change significantly between @xmath46 and @xmath10 .",
    "we have investigated the dependence of the [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratio on stellar mass and specific star formation ( ssfr ) at @xmath10 , using stacked grism spectra from the 3d - hst survey . by median - stacking many galaxy spectra ,",
    "most of which have no detected emission on an individual basis , we are able to measure [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratios at unprecedentedly high stellar masses and low specific ssfrs in the high - redshift universe .",
    "we use the sdss dr7 star - forming galaxies as our local universe comparison sample and we find that the [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratios of individual high - redshift galaxies are offset from the average sdss ratios by @xmath42 dex .",
    "median stacking the 3d - hst sample in bins of stellar mass shows that the elevated line ratios at @xmath10 are less extreme but still significant , with an average offset of @xmath48 dex .",
    "median stacking galaxies in bins of ssfr highlights the power of stacking analyses to probe greater swathes of galaxy properties and to avoid the pitfalls of selecting galaxies via emission lines alone .",
    "we have shown that [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratios are strongly correlated with ssfr at @xmath10 and do not appear to be offset from the median ratios at @xmath11 at fixed ssfr .",
    "our results suggest that ssfr is connected to the excitation properties of star - forming galaxies across cosmic time and that elevated [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratios may be driven by high ssfr at @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in this context",
    ", the observed evolution of the stellar mass - [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratio relation with redshift may be a consequence of galaxies today having on average much lower ssfrs than galaxies at the peak of cosmic star formation @xcite .",
    "it has been previously shown that large ssfrs lead to increased ionization parameters and electron densities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which in turn can produce the observed large [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratios .",
    "there exists a population of local galaxies with similarly `` extreme '' star - formation conditions as to what has been inferred for individual galaxies with large [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ratios at high redshift @xcite .",
    "however , for the first time , we show that there also exists a population of galaxies at @xmath10 which are implied ( through their low ssfrs and low line ratios ) to have conditions similar to more typical local star - forming galaxies .",
    "the exact connection between the physical parameters that govern the [ oiii]/h@xmath0 emission line ratio and ssfr remains unclear .",
    "our data , while able to probe a wide swath of the galaxy population , can not provide insight into the true conditions of star formation in these galaxies , as we can not measure any of the additional emission lines ( e.g , [ oii]@xmath493727 , [ oiii]@xmath494363 , [ nii]/h@xmath16 ) which would break the degeneracies inherent in the [ oiii]/h@xmath0 measurement .",
    "additionally , contamination from undetected agn and composite galaxies remains a concern .",
    "our work highlights the need for spectroscopic surveys that probe the full extent of the galaxy population at high redshift .",
    "as has been previously shown by @xcite and @xcite , sample selection on the basis of luminosity leads to the erroneous conclusion that all galaxies at high redshift exhibit elevated [ oiii]/h@xmath0 and high ssfrs .",
    "the next generation of 30-meter class telescopes will open up previously inaccessible galaxy populations for spectroscopic surveys , which will be key to understanding the nature of star formation across cosmic time .",
