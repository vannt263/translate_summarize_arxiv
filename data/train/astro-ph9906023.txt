    "a region of the sky that presents a significant number of groups and clusters is the so called centaurus concentration ( lynden - bell et al . 1989 ) which is a collection of about 20 groups and poor clusters which could be associated with the great attractor ( lynden - bell et al .",

    "only a few of these groups have been studied in detail ( e.g. , a3574 by richter 1984 ; 1987 ; willmer et al .",

    "another reason for the paucity of studies of individual groups of galaxies in the region ( as well as elsewhere ) are the biases to which this kind of system is susceptible . in general , when analysing groups identified from the wide - angle redshift surveys ( e.g. , huchra & geller 1982 ; maia et al .",

    "the first is the variable limiting absolute magnitude of the group - finding algorithms ( which is a function of redshift ) , so that typically only the brightest components are sampled .",
    "the second is the possibility that some of these groups are only chance projections along the line of sight rather than true physical associations , as only a few galaxies at most are assigned to the groups .",
    "the most effective means of overcoming these limitations is to probe the luminosity function of the groups to much fainter limits ( e.g. , zabludoff & mulchaey 1998a ; mulchaey & zabludoff 1998a ; koranyi et al . 1998 ; mahdavi et al .",
    "1999 ) , which allows not only establishing which galaxies are group members , but also ensures a more robust estimation of the group s physical parameters ( e.g. , zabludoff & mulchaey 1998a ) .    in this work we present a redshift survey of a @xmath0 4 square degrees region centered on ic  4296 , which is the brightest galaxy of the cluster a3565 , one of the groups belonging to the centaurus concentration .",

    "this paper is organized as follows : the acquisition and observations of the galaxy sample are described in section 2 , followed by the analyses in section 3 .",
    "a summary of the main results follows in section 4 .",
    "the sample of galaxies was defined from scans of an on - film copy of the eso / uppsala survey field 383 in the @xmath17 band ( iiiaf emulsion + gg630 filter , lauberts & valentijn 1989 , hereafter eso  lv ) using the observatrio nacional pds 1010a microdensitometer . a square slit of 20@xmath18 size",
    "was used , corresponding to 1.35@xmath19 @xmath2 1.35@xmath19 projected on the sky , about 0.251 @xmath2 0.251 kpc at the cluster distance , where @xmath6 = @xmath20/100 mpc@xmath8 .",
    "we scanned an area of 2.17@xmath2 2.17(1.41 mpc @xmath2 1.4 1 mpc ) centered close to the position of ic  4296 .",
    "the scanned area was divided into a mosaic of 9 scans each of 2000 @xmath2 2000 pixels , with 100 pixels overlap between contiguous scans .",
    "this was done to minimize possible variations of the instrument focus due to the fact that we were not scanning a plate , while the overlap ensured that few objects on the border between scans , if any , would be lost , and would also allow a verification of the photometric stability .",
    "the scans were transformed into intensities in a procedure entirely analogous to that of marston ( 1988 ) where the characteristic curve is derived comparing the surface brightness profiles of galaxies measured from the scans and ccd photometry .",
    "after the transformation into intensities , the scans were processed with focas ( jarvis & tyson 1981 ; valdes 1982 ) , and a possible candidate object was considered whenever it contained more than 9 contiguous pixels above the threshold , which we took as being 3 @xmath3 above the sky level . objects in common to one or more scans",
    "were later used to shift the scans into the same instrumental magnitude system ( e.g. , maddox et al . 1990 ) .    the astrometric solution for each of the 9 individual scans",
    "was obtained independently .",
    "the first step was to identify in the object catalogue stars contained in the hst guide star catalogue ( lasker et al .",
    "1990 , hereafter hstgc ) .",
    "the positions of these stars were redetermined following the procedure of assafin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using the ppm ( rser & bastian 1991 ) and acrs ( corbin & urban 1988 ) catalogues . basically , we selected ppm and acrs stars in a 2wide region centered on the individual scan , which were used to refine the hstgc star positions , therefore defining the secondary reference frame with a rms error of @xmath0 0.5@xmath19 .",
    "the secondary frame was then used to transform the scan @xmath21 and @xmath22 positions into right ascension and declination .",
    "we estimate that positional uncertainties should be smaller than 1@xmath19 .",
    "the calibration used ccd photometry for 15 galaxies obtained during two observing runs at the lna , the details of which are described in table 1 .",
    "the magnitudes were measured at three different isophotal levels , as described by alonso et al .",
    "the calibrating galaxies are presented in table 2 which shows in column ( 1 ) the galaxy identification used in this work , followed in column ( 2 ) by the previous identification when known ; the @xmath17 magnitudes and errors for each of the surface brightness levels 24 , 25 and 26 @xmath23 are presented in columns ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , and column ( 6 ) identifies the observing run described in table 1 .",
    "the magnitudes used in our catalogue , which we will denominate , were obtained through a linear fit between the @xmath24 and the instrumental photographic magnitudes .",
    "an estimate of the uncertainty of our magnitudes was obtained by comparing our measurements with @xmath24 of the eso - lv catalogue for 25 galaxies in common .",
    "the comparison presented in figure 1 shows that there is a mean difference    @xmath25 = 0.05 @xmath26 0.24 @xmath1 .",

    "both comparisons suggest that our magnitudes have an average probable uncertainty of @xmath0 0.18  @xmath1 if the errors are similar for each of the data sets .    the final catalog used to define the spectroscopic observations was limited at = 15.5 @xmath1 before making reddening corrections . in the analyses in section 3 , galaxy magnitudes were corrected for extinction using the dirbe  iras maps of schlegel ( 1998 ) interpolated for the position of each galaxy , where we have assumed that @xmath28 = @xmath29 . in general",
    "the average reddening in the @xmath17 band for this region is @xmath0 0.15 @xmath1 .",
    "the spectroscopic data used in this work were obtained at different telescopes , which are summarized in table 3 , where we identify the site ( column 1 ) , the telescope size ( column 2 ) , while the detector is identified in column ( 3 ) and its size in column ( 4 ) ; column ( 5 ) shows the grating rule , followed by the dispersion ( column 6 ) , resolution ( column 7 ) and wavelength coverage ( column 8) .",
    "the data were reduced in exactly the same manner as the ssrs2 data ( da costa et al .",
    "1998 ) , following the usual procedures of removing bias images , correcting by flatfield and making illumination corrections ( e.g. , massey 1992 ) , all within iraf .",
    "radial velocities were measured using the rvsao package ( kurtz et al .",
    "1992 ; kurtz & mink 1998 ) .",
    "in addition to the standard templates supplied with rvsao , we used composite spectra of stars of various spectral types , a composite spectrum of galaxies measured for the ssrs ( da costa et al .",

    "1998 ) , which shared the same instrumental setups of the majority of observing runs reported herein , and was processed with the same software , the estimated velocity error for most spectra should be of the order of @xmath0 40 .",

    "( 1999 ) for their measurements ( 67 ) this implies in an uncertainty of 55 for our radial velocities .",
    "there are 6 galaxies in common with quintana et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for which we also measured radial velocities .",
    "we find a mean difference of @xmath30  ",
    "@xmath32 = 125 @xmath26 83 .",
    "the origin of this fairly large offset is unclear .",
    "the final sample of galaxies is presented in table 4 ] where we give in column ( 1 ) our object identification ; in column ( 2 ) the previous identification obtained by matching galaxy positions with objects in the ned database , and for a few cases with the hstgc , the original reference being identified in the footnotes ; the right ascension and declination for epoch b1950.0 in columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) respectively and the magnitudes in column ( 5 ) .",
    "a rough morphological classification is shown in column ( 6 ) , in a system consistent with that of da costa et al .",

    "we should note that for fainter galaxies these classifications are uncertain because of the small apparent sizes .",
    "this is followed in column ( 7 ) by the heliocentric radial velocity ; the estimated internal error ( column 8) ; the number of emission lines used in the redshift determination ( column 9 ) and the source code for the radial velocity ( column 10 ) , where s1 , s2 , etc .",
    "refer to the run number in table 3 , or the references shown in the table notes . in the table we have included all galaxies identified in this region to about @xmath0 16.4 @xmath1 .",
    "a total of 166 new observations are reported in this work , including the outer region discussed in appendix a.",
    "the sample of galaxies brighter than = 15.5 @xmath1 considered in this work is shown in figure 2 , where the symbols represent galaxies in different redshift intervals , as noted in the caption , while the symbol size is a function of the object magnitude .",
    "the most prominent features in this plot are a3560 at approximately 13@xmath12 30@xmath13 and 3250@xmath14 , at the upper right , and a3565 at 13@xmath12 33@xmath13 3340@xmath14 , close to the center of the surveyed region . to the adopted magnitude limit , there are 111 galaxies , of which 110 ( 99% ) have measured radial velocities . the distribution in radial velocities bins of 250",
    "is shown in figure 3 , where all velocities were corrected for galactic rotation through @xmath33 .",
    "the two main peaks correspond to a3565 at @xmath0 3600 and galaxies associated with a3560 and the shapley concentration at @xmath0 15000 kms@xmath8 .",
    "the smaller peak at @xmath0 7000 is due to a group of 3 galaxies close to the position of ic  4296 , plus a few other galaxies distributed over the whole field .",
    "this loose distribution of galaxies at @xmath0 7000 has also been detected by drinkwater et al .",
    "in contrast , the structure at @xmath0 11000 found by those authors in the foreground of the shapley concentration is not very prominent in our sample ; an inspection of their redshift maps suggests that most of the galaxies in that structure are located to the south of our survey .",
    "the peak corresponding to a3565 in figure 3 contains 30 galaxies which are well separated in velocity space from the foreground galaxies at @xmath0 2000 and the background at @xmath0 7000 kms@xmath8 . because the surveyed area is rather small ( @xmath34 1 mpc ) , it is possible that some outlying galaxies are being lost ( e.g. , mahdavi et al .",
    "this in fact is suggested when comparing the present catalogue with that derived by garcia ( 1993 ) using the leda database ( paturel et al .",
    "1991 ) , which contains three galaxies beyond the survey boundaries .",
    "however , in order to keep our sample homogeneous and well defined , we have not considered in the analysis these possible member galaxies . in this work",
    "we will consider as group members only those galaxies that are within the surveyed area and with radial velocities within 3 @xmath3 of the cluster mean ( yahil & vidal 1977 ) , where @xmath3 is the cluster velocity dispersion uncorrected for velocity errors .",
    "this eliminates wmma 219 ( @xmath35=4494 ) from the sample .",
    "the spatial distribution of likely member galaxies of a3565 is shown in figure 4 , where again we have coded the symbol size as a function of the apparent magnitude of the galaxy , while crosses represent galaxies with emission lines in the spectra , and open squares galaxies only presenting absorption line spectra .    in table 5",
    "we present the dynamical properties of a3565 , most of which were calculated using the `` classical estimators '' ( mean radial velocity , velocity dispersion and mass ) , while the cluster centroid was estimated using an unweighted average .",
    "the velocity dispersion and errors were derived following danese et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , where the radial velocity uncertainty is accounted for , while for the other parameters we used the `` jacknife '' technique ( e.g. , bothun et al .",
    "in the table we also show the values of the central location and scale estimates calculated using rostat ( beers et al .",
    "1990 ) , the errors for the latter being estimated by means of 1000 bootstrap simulations . as may be seen in the table , the values of both classical and robust estimators agree very well .",
    "all these parameters were calculated without weighting by luminosity .",
    "the mean harmonic radius ( r@xmath36 ) , the mean pairwise separation ( r@xmath37 ) and the virial mass ( m@xmath38 ) were calculated using the expressions of ramella , geller & huchra ( 1989 ) .",
    "the uncertainty for the latter was estimated using standard error propagation , which takes into account the uncertainty in @xmath3 and the jacknife error for r@xmath36 .",
    "we also calculate the projected mass ( m@xmath37 ) which is an estimator proposed by heisler , tremaine & bahcall ( 1985 ) that is less sensitive to the presence of interlopers .",
    "both m@xmath38 and m@xmath37 were shown by west , oemler & dekel ( 1988 ) to give reliable measures of the cluster mass .",
    "the velocity dispersion of a3565 ( 228 ) is marginally higher than the typical value for groups of galaxies @xmath0 194 ( ramella et al .",
    "1999 ) , yet in the lower range of velocity dispersions measured by zabludoff & mulchaey ( 1998a ) in their sample of 12 poor clusters with x - ray emission .",

    "the uncertainties for m@xmath38 are of the order of 30% , a value which is consistent with that measured for simulated clusters by west et al .",
    "the estimated uncertainty measured for m@xmath37 is probably too small , as the latter authors found that it presents comparable errors to those of m@xmath38 .",
    "the dynamics of a3565 is significantly influenced by the presence of ic  4296 , which , although not classified as a cd , does present an extended profile quantified by a value of n=11.8 for a sersic law ( graham et al .",

    "the large extent of this galaxy was also noted by saglia et al .",

    "the internal velocity dispersion profile of this galaxy is greater than 200 and has a rather flat appearance , indicating the presence of a massive dark halo ( saglia et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the velocity histogram of group members ( corrected to the local group centroid ) is shown in figure 5 where the dashed line indicates the radial velocity of ic  4296 ( @xmath40 = 3593 ) .",
    "this is almost identical to the value of the bi - weight estimate for the central location velocity of the cluster ( 3586 ) .",
    "this result differs from the conclusion of kemp ( 1994 ) , who found that a difference of @xmath0 150 between ic  4296 and the group s mean radial velocity , though the reason for this discrepancy is unclear .",
    "the projected separation of ic  4296 to the group s centroid about 0.14 1 mpc . in order to check whether this could be due to the presence of interlopers at large angular separations",
    ", we also determined the dynamical parameters in the case where only galaxies within a radius of @xmath0 0.5 ( 0.31 1 mpc ) from ic  4296 were considered .",
    "this radius excludes galaxies such as ngc  5193 and ngc  5193a which , as mentioned in the introduction , have been assigned to another system by abell et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and lauer et al .",
    "this smaller sample contains 21 galaxies , and reduces the projected separation between the group center and ic  4296 to 0.07 1 mpc , while the radial velocity difference is slightly larger , increasing from 7 to 39 , still within the measurement errors .",

    "for the 19 absorption line systems we find 231 ( + 51 , 32 ) using the classical estimator , and 242 @xmath26 42 using the bi - weight rostat estimator , while for the 10 emission line systems these are 232 ( + 82 , 41 ) and 235 @xmath26 66 , respectively .",

    "as noted above , ic  4296 has an internal velocity dispersion @xmath0 200 , which reaches up to @xmath0 300 in its central regions ( wegner et al .",
    "1999 ; kemp 1994 ) .",
    "this value is comparable to the velocity dispersion of a3565 , and it is interesting to note that of the sample of 12 clusters studied by zabludoff & mulchaey ( 1998a ) , only 2 present a similar feature , although the significance of this result is unclear . the high value of the velocity dispersion could imply that at least some of the x - ray emiting gas is more influenced by the galaxy rather than the cluster ( e.g. , david & blumenthal 1992 ) .",
    "the scenario where gas is bound by the central galaxy as well as by the cluster potential is consistent with the conclusions of mulchaey & zabludoff ( 1998a ) , who obtained better fits to the observed x - ray distribution when a two - component model was considered : one component would be due to the central galaxy and the second component due to the diffuse gas .",
    "such a scenario was considered by mulchaey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , to explain the rather low value of @xmath46 they measured for a3565 .      in figure 7",
    "we show the distribution of galaxies with radial velocities between 13000 @xmath49 16000 kms@xmath8 , which roughly corresponds to the redshift interval of the shapley concentration .",
    "in addition to a3560 there is a dispersed distribution of galaxies which belong to the shapley supercluster , but are not part of the cluster . even though a3560 is close to the nw border of the surveyed region , enough galaxies",
    "are contained in the survey that an estimate of the dynamical parameters of the cluster is possible . in this analysis",
    "we will consider the galaxies within the range of 13@xmath12 28@xmath50 13@xmath12 33@xmath13 and -3235@xmath51 -3320@xmath19 as likely members . within these limits and",
    "the radial velocity range above , there are 33 galaxies .",
    "their distribution seen in figure 7 suggests that a3560 could be composed of two concentrations of galaxies .",
    "this is also suggested by the histogram of radial velocities in figure 8 , where two velocity peaks are seen : one at @xmath0 13600 and the other at @xmath0 14800 kms@xmath8 . in order to confirm",
    "whether both the spatial and redshift distribution could be due to subclustering , we applied the statistical tests described by pinkney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to the sample . only the lee 2-d and lee 3-d statistics detect any significant level of subclustering . the dressler & shectman ( 1988 ) @xmath52 statistic in particular , which is the most sensitive test ( pinkney et al .",
    "1996 ) , detects no significant evidence of subclustering .",
    "therefore , in the determination of the physical parameters for a3560 , shown in the last column of table 5 , we will assume that there is no subclustering .",
    "in the analysis that follows we also applied the 3 @xmath3 clipping algorith ( yahil & vidal 1977 ) , which removes one galaxy from the sample ( wmma 076 , @xmath35 = 13361 ) .    the velocity dispersion we measure for this cluster , ( 588 kms@xmath8 ) is smaller than that measured by melnick & moles ( 1987 ) , 838 kms@xmath8 which was based on 10 galaxies .",
    "our mass estimate using the virial theorem ( @xmath0 2 @xmath2 10@xmath9 m@xmath5 ) is close to the value estimated by ettori et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from x - ray data ( @xmath0 2.3 @xmath2 10@xmath9 m@xmath5 ) .",
    "the projected mass is a factor of 2 larger than the virial estimator , and this could be due to the combination of the small sample size with a somewhat complex distribution of galaxies , which is seen not only in the optical data , but also in the x - ray maps for this cluster of pierre et al .",
    "as may be seen in their figure 6 , there are four x - ray peaks in the direction of a3560 , and excepting for the most extended source , they are not well correlated with the distribution of galaxies down to the limiting magnitude used in this work .",
    "we should note that the centroid we determine here for a3560 differs from the position of melnick & moles ( 1987 ) , probably because of the larger range in right ascension we are considering . the range used here corresponds to @xmath0 1.6 1 mpc at the mean cluster distance .",
    "the centroid in table 5 is about 0.13 , or 0.32 1 mpc away from the position of galaxies wmma 032 and wmma 033 in table 4 , which form a dumbbell system ( gregorini et al .",
    "the fact that this type of system is typically found in the central regions of clusters ( valentijn & casertano 1988 ) , suggests that the centroid of a3560 may be close to this position .",
    "further support for this interpretation is the presence of the main component of the diffuse x - ray emission detected by pierre et al .",
    "( 1994 ) which also peaks close to the position of the dumbbell galaxy .",
    "in particular , if one considers the sample of galaxies to = 16.0 @xmath1 , which has 80% radial velocity completeness , the distribution of galaxies with redshifts centered on the dumbbell becomes much more pronounced .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the mass - to - light ratio is large ( @xmath0 760 ( m / l@xmath53)@xmath5 ) is also suggestive that the cluster membership as considered in this work is uncertain .",
    "all these results suggest that our conclusions regarding a3560 should only be considered as preliminary , since a larger and fainter sample will be required to describe more accurately the distribution of galaxies in this region .",
    "the radial velocities of the dumbbell components differ by 10 , while their projected separation is of the order of 9 1 kpc .",
    "both values are somewhat smaller that the typical values for this kind of system quoted by valentijn & casertano ( 1988 ) .",
    "both nuclei have absorption line spectra , neither presenting any significant evidence of having undergone recent episodes of star formation .",
    "the mean radial velocity of these systems is shown in figure 8 as a dotted line , which is about 60 away from the mean radial velocity of the group in table 5 .",
    "in this paper we have presented the redshift survey of a 2.17@xmath2 2.17region centered on the galaxy ic  4296 , which is the brightest galaxy in the a3565 cluster .",
    "the present work extends the coverage of galaxies of a3565 to a limit of @xmath54 + 3 , within a radius of @xmath0 0.7 1 mpc .",
    "both the radial extent and the number of members for this cluster are comparable to what was found for similar systems by zabludoff & mulchaey ( 1998a ) and mulchaey & zabludoff ( 1998a ) in their study of the optical and x - ray properties of 12 poor clusters of galaxies . the velocity dispersion , as well as the mass we measure for a3565 are within the range of values quoted in those works , and a3565 has dynamical properties typical of x - ray emitting poor clusters .",
    "this cluster contains galaxies undergoing interactions ( ngc  5215a and ngc  5215b ; kemp & meaburn 1991 ) , and with common haloes ( ic  4296 and ic  4299 ; kemp 1994 ) .",
    "this evidence coupled to the small value of the velocity dispersion of the system suggests that bright galaxies could still be forming in a3565 through mergers .",
    "such a scenario has been suggested in recent works by mulchaey & zabludoff ( 1998b ) and zabludoff & mulchaey ( 1998b ) who find that the brightest galaxies in groups as well as the groups themselves could still be forming through the accretion of smaller systems , and that the merger rate is most efficient in groups with @xmath55 200 , which is the case of a3565 .    as in other poor clusters with diffuse x - ray emission , ( e.g. , zabludoff & mulchaey 1998a ; mahdavi et al .",
    "1999 ) , a3565 also shows radial segregation between galaxies presenting emission lines , mainly found in the outer parts of the cluster , while absorption line systems are concentrated towards the cluster center .",
    "this radial segregation together with the bending of the radio jets of ic  4296 noted by killeen & bicknell ( 1988 ) , and the presence of several galaxies with distorted morphologies ( kemp & meaburn 1993 ) , suggest that the intergalactic medium of a3565 could also play an important role in the dynamical evolution of this system .",
    "we also measured redshifts of galaxies belonging to the a3560 cluster , a background system that belongs to the shapley concentration .",
    "although the velocity dispersion we measure for a3560 ( @xmath0 580 ) is typical of rich galaxy clusters , our results for this cluster should only be taken as preliminary .",
    "this is suggested by the relatively bright limiting absolute magnitude of our work at the distance of a3560 ( m@xmath56 m@xmath57 ) ; the relatively complex distribution of galaxies and x - ray emission ; the discrepancies between the mass estimators , and the large m / l ratio we measure .",
    "therefore , to characterize the membership and dynamics of this cluster , a larger and fainter sample will be needed .",
    "a more extensive though shallower survey in a larger ( 5@xmath2 5 ) region in the general direction of a3565 shows no significant increase in the number of cluster members .",
    "a further 51 galaxies were observed , and are listed in table 6 where column ( 1 ) shows the hstgc identification , and in column ( 2 ) other identifications if known ; columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) the right ascension and declination for epoch b1950.0 followed by the new radial velocity and the internal estimated error , respectively in columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . in this table",
    "we also include three serendipitous objects that were observed in the course of the survey , which are noted in the table .",
    "the coordinates for these three objects were estimated from the dss . because most objects in table 6 were defined from a blue selected sample with @xmath58  15.5 @xmath1 , where @xmath59 is the blue magnitude at the 26 @xmath23 ( alonso et al .",
    "1993 ; da costa et al .",
    "1998 ) , we did not include them in the analysis of the group .",
    "however , the distribution of galaxies may be seen in figure 9 , where we code galaxies in different redshift intervals as in figure 4 .",
    "the main feature to note is that very few galaxies in the redshift interval of a3565 are added in the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "we would like to thank marcelo assafin for his help on the astrometric calibration , jason pinkney for providing the code to calculate significance levels of subclustering , and ricardo schiavon for the observations in the s11 run .",
