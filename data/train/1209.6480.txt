    "neutrino astronomy is a powerful tool both for the astrophysics and the particle physics fields .",
    "neutrinos have specific advantages to study the universe compared to other more traditional probes , like photons or cosmic rays .",
    "photons , in particular at high energies , are absorbed by matter and radiation , which severely limits their range in the @xmath01 tev region .",
    "cosmic rays ( crs ) also interact with matter and radiation and in addition to this , they are deflected by galactic and extra - galactic magnetic fields .",
    "neutrinos , on the other hand , are neutral and only interact weakly , which makes them unique sources of information of the high energy universe .",
    "the price to pay , given that they only interact weakly and that the expected fluxes are low , is that large detection volumes are needed .",
    "the scientific scope for neutrino telescopes is very wide .",
    "one of the main goals is to understand the origin of crs .",
    "a century has past since v. hess showed that they are produced outside the earth .",
    "since they are deflected by magnetic fields , as mentioned above , it is not clear which sources are producing them , in particular for high energies .",
    "however , in the interactions of high energy crs mentioned above , high energy neutrinos are also produced :    @xmath1    therefore , the observation of neutrinos , which are neutral and therefore not deflected , can help to pinpoint the sources producing crs  @xcite .",
    "another important question that neutrino telescopes can help to solve concerns the origin of the high energy photons observed in many astrophysical sources .",
    "there are two basic mechanisms through which these photons can be produced .",
    "one is based on the so - called leptonic scenarios , in which the photons are produced via processes like inverse compton scattering . in some of the sources ,",
    "this mechanism can explain well the observations .",
    "however , this is not the case in many sources , like supernova remnant rx1713.7 3946  @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "hadronic mechanisms can be invoked in which the observed high energy gammas are due to the decay of neutral pions produced in the interactions of nucleons with matter or radiation .",
    "these neutral pions will decay and produce high energy photons .",
    "therefore , the observation of neutrinos from the decay of charged pions also produced in these interactions would support the hadronic scenarios .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the detection principle and the antares neutrino detector will be described in section  [ sec : antares ] .",
    "section  [ sec : ps ] presents the results of the search for steady point sources .",
    "the studies made on transient sources are explained in section  [ sec : transients ] . the search for diffuse cosmic fluxes",
    "are described in section  [ sec : diffuse ] .",
    "the analysis looking for dark matter is presented in section  [ sec : dm ] .",
    "section  [ sec : other ] summarizes other searches performed by the collaboration .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the detection principle of neutrino telescopes is as follows .",
    "the detector is a three - dimensional array of photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) which collect the cherenkov light induced by relativistic muons produced in the charged - current interactions of high energy muon neutrinos in the surroundings of the detector .",
    "other signatures are also possible : cascade events produced in the neutral current interactions of all the neutrino flavors or in the charged - current interactions of electron and tau neutrinos .    antares  @xcite is installed in the mediterranean sea at a depth of 2475 m and at about 40 km from toulon ( france ) .",
    "it is made of 885 pmts distributed along 12 mooring lines anchored in the bottom of the sea .",
    "the pmts are enclosed in glass spheres ( oms ) .",
    "the oms are grouped in triplets , being the separation between triplets ( or floors ) 14.5  m. the separation between lines is 60 - 75  m. the lines are connected to a `` junction - box '' which is linked to the shore station through an electro - optical cable .",
    "a system of hydrophones and compasses installed in the detector keeps track of the line movements , allowing for a resolution of about 15  cm in the position of the line elements  @xcite . in order to achieve sub - degree angular resolution",
    ", it is also important the time calibration  @xcite of the detector .",
    "this is done by several complementary systems , like the set of led - based devices called optical beacons . a schematic view of the detector is shown in figure  [ fig : detector ] .",
    "the search for cosmic point sources is one of the main goals of neutrino telescopes .",
    "the basic strategy for this analysis is to look for an accumulation of events in the sky , so that the probability that the background ( atmospheric neutrinos and muons ) has produced it by chance is very low .",
    "we also use the fact that the energy spectrum for cosmic signal is harder than for the background , so the typical energy for signal events is higher .",
    "the cluster search is made by means of a likelihood procedure .",
    "the background is estimated directly from data ( by randomizing the events in right ascension ) in order to reduce systematic effects . for the signal ,",
    "monte carlo simulations provide the point - spread function , which depends on the energy of the event .",
    "a first analysis was done with data of 2007 - 2008  @xcite . for the analysis presented here ,",
    "data from 29 - 1 - 2007 to 14 - 11 - 2010 are used  @xcite .",
    "the integrated live - time is 813 days , out of which 183 correspond to the period when only five lines where installed .",
    "the selection of the events is based on several criteria .",
    "first , only up - going events are selected .",
    "this condition rejects most of the atmospheric muon background , since muons can not traverse the earth .",
    "this is not enough to reject the atmospheric muon background at an acceptable level , since a fraction of them ( small , but given the fact that the flux is very large , not negligible ) are mis - reconstructed as up - going events .",
    "however , the quality of the fit for these misreconstructed events is bad , so a parameter describing such reconstruction quality is used to further reject this background .",
    "finally , the estimated error in the reconstructed track direction is required to be @xmath2 .",
    "the final sample contains 3058 neutrino candidates .",
    "simulations predict 358@xmath3179 atmospheric muons and 2040@xmath3722 atmospheric neutrinos , consistent with observation .",
    "the angular resolution for this sample , assuming an e@xmath4 spectrum , is estimated in 0.46@xmath30.10 degrees .",
    "two different strategies have been followed for this analysis .",
    "first , an all - sky search , where the whole sky is scanned looking for accumulations of events . figure  [ fig : skymap ] shows the sky map of the p - values before trial factor corrections . the most signal - like cluster",
    "is found in @xmath5 , where there are five events within one degree around this position . by generating pseudo - experiments for the only - background assumption",
    ", it is estimated that the post - trial p - values is 2.6% , equivalent to 2.2@xmath6 significance ( two - sided sigma convention ) .",
    "secondly , a search in the direction of 51 sources which are good candidates for neutrino emission . no excess has been found in any of these searches ( see table  [ tab : list ] ) , being the most significant cluster found in hess j1023 - 575 , with a p - value of 0.41 .",
    "upper limits in the neutrino flux are set , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : limits ] .",

    "this is not the case of observations of gamma - ray or positron excess observed by other indirect searches . moreover , though the sensitivities for spin - independent cross sections can not compete with those of direct search experiments ( since it is proportional to the square of the atomic number of the target and in the sun there are mostly protons and helium ) , this is not the case for spin - dependent cross section , where neutrino telescopes offer the best limits .",

    "a on / off source search has found 75 events in the on - source region , whereas 90@xmath35(stat)@xmath33(sys ) were expected from background .",
