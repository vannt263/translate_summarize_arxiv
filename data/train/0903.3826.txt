    "in the last decade the neutron - rich nuclei in the @xmath3 region have attracted both theoretical and experimental attention .",
    "they were extensively studied via spontaneous or induced fission reactions .",
    "nuclei from this region of segr chart exhibit vibrational , transitional , and rotational types of collectivity .",
    "the neutron - rich palladium and ruthenium nuclei , for example , show a typical transitional behavior while molybdenum isotopes exhibit a vibrational to near - rotational evolution  @xcite .",
    "such changes in the degree of collectivity are even stronger in the zirconium isotopic chain  @xcite where the structure evolves from near - vibrational in @xmath4zr to rotational - like in @xmath5zr , the latter being the most deformed nucleus of the neutron - rich @xmath6 isotopes . as the next zirconium isotope",
    "@xmath2zr is an @xmath0 mid - shell nucleus , an even larger deformation can be expected .",
    "a detailed analysis of some spectroscopic observables , such as the ratio @xmath7 of excitation energies of the first @xmath8 and @xmath9 levels  @xcite or the amplitude of even - odd staggering in the @xmath10 band  @xcite , shows that mid - shell effects in palladium isotopes occur in @xmath11pd , _",
    "i.e. _ two and four neutrons beyond @xmath0 . in",
    "the ruthenium isotopes these effects arise precisely at @xmath0 while in the molybdenum chain they occur in @xmath2mo , _",
    "i.e. _ two neutrons before mid - shell .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the degree of collectivity decreases in the heavier @xmath12 molybdenum isotopes @xmath13mo . in spite of the fact that the experimental information on the heavy zirconium nuclei is poor ,",
    "it is clear that the degree of collectivity increases towards @xmath5zr  @xcite which has 64 neutrons and is the heaviest zirconium isotope known to date .",
    "the shift of the mid - shell in the various isotopic chains was explained in ref .",
    "@xcite as resulting from the filling of the neutron @xmath14 and proton @xmath15 intruder orbitals .",
    "self - consistent calculations show that in the region of neutron - rich nuclei approaching the neutron - drip line , the single - particle shell structure may significantly change due to the diffuseness of the neutron density  @xcite .",
    "also , as widely discussed in the literature , due to a predicted weakening of the spin - orbit force , new magic numbers may be expected in neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "for instance , in a study of @xmath16 isotones , evidence for shell quenching was presented in ref .",
    "on the other hand , jungclaus _ et al . _",
    "@xcite argued that from the isomeric decay study in @xmath17cd there is no direct evidence for the shell quenching in the region of the heavy cadmium nuclei .    the lower-@xmath18 @xmath16 nuclei , however ,",
    "have not yet been studied experimentally and the suppression of the shell effects in this region is still an open question .",
    "properties of these nuclei were predicted within a relativistic hartree - fock bogoliubov ( hfb ) approach  @xcite .",
    "the calculations , performed with different parametrizations , show that the @xmath16 shell gap persists in the heavy palladium and ruthenium nuclei but that a weakening of this gap is expected in the zirconium isotopes .",
    "for example , the two - neutron separation energies from @xmath19zr to @xmath20zr , obtained via hfb calculations with the skp interaction , show no discontinuity at @xmath16 but a rather smooth behavior .",
    "as discussed above , nuclear collective behavior is expected to enhance towards the mid - shell as a result of the increase in valence particle number . if , however , the hfb+skp scenario for the zirconium isotopes turns out to be valid and @xmath16 vanishes or is weakened in the neutron - rich region , then the determination of valence - particle number is fraught with ambiguity , leading to a different behavior of nuclear collectivity in this isotopic chain .",
    "the aim of the present paper , therefore , is to predict the spectroscopic properties concerning the @xmath0 mid - shell zirconium nucleus @xmath2zr , based on the assumption that @xmath16 remains a magic number in the heavy zirconium isotopes .",
    "comparison with results of future experiments on this nucleus will then reveal whether this hypothesis is borne out or not .",
    "often the only available information about neutron - rich nuclei comes from prompt @xmath10-ray spectroscopy .",
    "the observed levels are grouped into @xmath21 sequences , corresponding to the ground - state band , and/or into @xmath22 sequences , based on a @xmath23 level which usually is interpreted as a quasi-@xmath10 band  @xcite . such structures naturally appear in the framework of the interacting boson model ( ibm )  @xcite which has been shown to be successful in the description of nuclear collective properties .",
    "the ibm in its first version , known as , is based on the assumption that nuclear collectivity can be expressed in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath25 bosons  @xcite .",
    "the model hamiltonian is constructed from a set of 36 operators , bilinear in the boson creation and annihilation operators and generating the u(6 ) lie algebra .",
    "dynamical symmetries occur if the hamiltonian can be written as a combination of invariant ( or casimir ) operators of specific subalgebras of u(6 )  @xcite and three such cases occur , namely the spherical vibrational limit u(5 ) , the deformed limit su(3 ) , and @xmath10-soft limit so(6 ) .",
    "these dynamical symmetries generate energy spectra with states that are labeled by the irreducible representations of the algebras in the respective chains that reduce the dynamical algebra u(6 ) into the symmetry algebra so(3 ) of rotations in three - dimensional space .",
    "the different limits thus correspond to nuclei with distinct collective properties .",
    "for example , in the so(6 ) limit the ground - state and @xmath10 bands lie in the same representation while in the su(3 ) limit they are in different ones , leading to forbidden or weaker inter - band transitions in the latter case .    in the @xmath26 nuclei of interest here strong transitions between the two bands are observed indicating that none of these nuclei can be interpreted in the exact su(3 ) limit , but rather a transitional behavior should be expected .",
    "this can be achieved in the by the use of the full hamiltonian which reads  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29^{(1)}_\\mu$ ] are the @xmath25-boson number and the angular momentum operators , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the quadrupole operator is defined as @xmath30^{(2)}_\\mu+\\chi[d^\\dag\\times\\tilde d]^{(2)}_\\mu$ ] , while the last two terms in the hamiltonian involve the operators @xmath31^{(3)}_\\mu$ ] and @xmath32^{(4)}_\\mu$ ] . in the present work",
    "there is no need for the rotational term @xmath33 and we take @xmath34 throughout .",
    "the total number of bosons @xmath35 is taken as half the number of valence particles or holes , counted from the nearest closed - shell configuration , following the prescription of ref .  @xcite .",
    "as such , calculations are indirectly related to the underlying shell structure .",
    "finally , in the consistent-@xmath36 formalism  @xcite the operator for electric quadrupole transitions is introduced as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the boson effective charge and @xmath39 is the quadrupole operator with the same parameter @xmath40 as in the hamiltonian  ( [ e_ham ] ) .",
    "since the addition or subtraction of a few nucleons may change significantly a nuclear spectrum , two nuclei with different numbers of valence neutrons and protons but with the same _ total _ number of valence nucleons  and hence the same number of bosons  may display different types of collectivity . in adjusting the parameters of the hamiltonian  ( [ e_ham ] ) to spectra observed in a given region of the nuclear chart ,",
    "it is therefore not sufficient to assume them to be constant for all nuclei since that would lead to identical spectra for nuclei with the same @xmath41 . instead",
    ", some dependence of the parameters on the _ separate _ neutron and proton boson numbers @xmath42 and @xmath43 should be imposed . to avoid the complexity of determining the correct functional dependence on @xmath42 and @xmath43 for each of the hamiltonian parameters",
    ", we have followed the simpler procedure of separately considering chains of isotopes , isotones , or isobars that end with the nucleus of interest , @xmath2zr , and fitting each chain with an independent set of parameters .",
    "this method avoids the problem of having identical spectra for constant boson number @xmath41 ( such nuclei belong to different chains ) and , in addition , since the extrapolation to @xmath2zr obtained from the different chains may vary , it gives an idea on the possible error of the prediction .        in the present application to @xmath2zr ,",
    "the @xmath0 isotonic chain includes @xmath10-unstable @xmath44pd , more triaxial @xmath45ru , and near - rotational @xmath46mo .",
    "the second set of nuclei belongs to the @xmath1 isobaric chain  @xcite extending from vibrational - like @xmath2pd to near - rotational @xmath2mo .",
    "unfortunately , the zirconium isotopic chain does not allow the determination of a unique set of model parameters since only yrast data are available for the neutron - rich isotopes @xmath47zr .",
    "consequently , only the isotonic and isobaric chains are considered in the fit .",
    "nuclei in a given chain are distinguished by the number of bosons ( _ i.e. _ , particle or hole pairs ) , counted from the nearest closed - shell configurations which are @xmath48 or @xmath49 for the protons , and @xmath50 or @xmath16 for the neutrons .",
    "figure  [ f_chart ] summarizes known nuclei in the neighbourhood of @xmath2zr .",
    "nuclei with known excited levels are distinguished ( full lines ) from those of which only ground - state properties are known ( dashed lines ) .",
    "furthermore , the nuclei used in the fit are high - lighted with thick lines .",
    "the model parameters @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , listed in table  [ t_param ] , are obtained after a least - squares fit to the experimental level energies .    .",
    "parameters and rms deviation ( in kev ) for the @xmath0 isotones and the @xmath1 isobars . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     also electric quadrupole transition probabilities have been considered for the neutron - rich nuclei belonging to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 chains .",
    "the calculated values are listed in tables  [ t_e2n66 ] and  [ t_e2a106 ] along with the few known experimental values  @xcite .",
    "the boson effective charge @xmath55  eb is obtained after a least - squares fit to the @xmath56(e2 ) values measured in @xmath2pd and this value is used for all other nuclei .",
    "the results show an increase of the @xmath57 value from the near - vibrational @xmath2pd towards the near - rotational @xmath46mo .",
    "this @xmath58 value is predicted highest for @xmath2zr and the calculations for the two different chains give a consistent value of @xmath590.55  e@xmath60b@xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , we note from table  [ t_e2a106 ] the behavior predicted for the @xmath61 value which is small in @xmath2pd and @xmath2zr but becomes large for the isotopes in between , a characteristic feature of transitional nuclei .",
    "the aim of this paper was to illustrate the usefulness of the interacting boson model in its simplest version , the , for predicting properties of exotic nuclei .",
    "the usual difficulty that arises with such attempts is that the variations of the model s parameters with the valence neutron and proton numbers are not known , precluding a reliable extrapolation to unknown regions of the nuclear chart .",
    "our method proposes to circumvent this problem by studying the structural evolution in three different chains of nuclei , namely isotopic , isotonic , and isobaric ones , which cross at the nucleus of interest at the outskirts of the region of stable nuclei .",
    "predictions are obtained by extrapolating the different chains to the exotic nucleus in question , and , in addition , a comparison of these extrapolations gives an idea of the errors involved .",
    "this method was applied to the neutron - rich members of the @xmath0 isotonic and @xmath1 isobaric chains of which level energies and electric quadrupole transition probabilities were fitted with .",
    "the two chains intersect at @xmath2zr which allowed the prediction of this nucleus excitation energies and electric quadrupole transition properties .    as a final remark",
    "we emphasize that the is a valence - nucleon model and that the extrapolations as described here crucially depend on the definition of neighboring closed - shell configurations .",
    "thus , the results on @xmath2zr indirectly involve the assumption of the persistence of magic numbers in this region of neutron - rich nuclei .",
