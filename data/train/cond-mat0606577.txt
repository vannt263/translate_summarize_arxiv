    "random two - phase heterogeneous media abound in synthetic products and nature .",
    "examples include composite materials , colloidal dispersions , gels , foams , wood , geologic media , and animal and plant tissue.@xcite the effective transport , mechanical and electromagnetic properties of such heteroegeneous materials are known to depend on correlation functions that statistically characterize the microstructure.@xcite it has recently been suggested that microstructure reconstruction problems can be posed as optimization problems.@xcite a set of _ target _ correlation functions are prescribed based upon experiments or theoretical models . starting from some initial realization of the random two - phase medium , the reconstruction method proceeds to find a realization by evolving the microstructure such that the calculated correlation functions best match the target functions .",
    "this intriguing inverse problem is solved by minimizing an _ error _ based upon the distance between the target and calculated correlation functions .",
    "the two - phase medium can be a dispersion of particles in some matrix ( liquid or solid ) @xcite or , more generally , a digitized image of a two - phase material.@xcite    an effective reconstruction procedure enables one to generate accurate structures at will , and subsequent analysis can be performed on the image to obtain desired macroscopic properties ( e.g. , transport , electromagnetic and mechanical properties ) of the media .",
    "this becomes especially useful in generating three - dimensional structures from planar information when three - dimensional imaging techniques are not available : a `` poor man s '' tomography experiment.@xcite    interestingly , the same procedure has been used to  construct \" realizations of two - phase media from a hypothetical target correlation function.@xcite in this mode , the procedure is referred to as a _ construction _ algorithm .",
    "there are mnay different types of statistical descriptors of two - phase media , @xcite but the most basic one is the two - point correlation function , which gives the probability of finding two points in one of the phases ( see definition below ) and is obtainable from small - angle x - ray scattering.@xcite the construction algorithm can be employed to determine if a prescribed two - point correlation function is in fact realizable . if such a two - point correlation function is realizable , then the procedure could be used to categorize classes of random microstructures , which would be a valuable accomplishment . however",
    ", not every hypothetical two - point correlation function corresponds to a realizable two - phase medium @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of great fundamental and practical importance to determine the necessary conditions that realizable two - point correlation functions must possess.@xcite we note in passing that this question is closely related to realizability issues of pair - correlation functions of many - particle systems.@xcite    one aim of this paper is to gather all of the known necessary conditions on the two - point correlation function of two - phase random media , also known as  random closed sets \" in the field of stochastic geometry.@xcite some of these conditions are well - known in the physical sciences literature , but others are more arcane and are contained in obscure mathematical technical reports and/or proceedings .",
    "we also derive a new but simple positivity condition on the two - point correlation function .",
    "we consider some illustrative examples of proposed correlation functions and test whether they can correspond to realizable two - phase random media .",
    "here we collect all of the known necessary conditions on the two - point correlation function of random media that are scattered throughout a diverse literature .",
    "we also derive a new positivity condition .",
    "each realization @xmath0 of the two - phase random medium occupies the region of @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space @xmath2 of volume @xmath3 that is partitioned into two _ random _ sets or _ phases _ whose interiors are disjoint : phase  1 , a region @xmath4 of volume fraction @xmath5 , and phase  2 , a region @xmath6 of volume fraction @xmath7 . for a given realization @xmath0 , the _ indicator function _",
    "@xmath8 for phase  @xmath9 at any position vector @xmath10 is defined by @xmath11 thus , a two - phase random medium is described by a binary stochastic process @xmath12 .",
    "for statistically homogeneous but anisotropic media , the first two correlation functions are given by@xcite @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 or @xmath16 , angular brackets denote an ensemble average , @xmath17 , and the symbol @xmath0 is henceforth dropped for brevity .",
    "( the generalization to @xmath18-point correlation functions for @xmath19 is straightforward.@xcite ) clearly , @xmath20 lies in the closed interval @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22 .",
    "the two - point or autocorrelation function @xmath23 for statistically homogeneous media gives the probability of finding the end points of a vector @xmath24 in phase @xmath9 .",
    "debye and bueche @xcite showed that the two - point correlation function of a porous medium can be obtained experimentally via small x - ray scattering .",
    "note that the two - point function for phase 2 is simply related to the corresponding function for phase 1 via the expression @xmath25 and thus the _ autocovariance _",
    "function @xmath26 for phase 1 is equal to that for phase 2 .",
    "generally , for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and in the absence of no _ long - range _ order , @xmath29    an important necessary condition for the existence of a two - point correlation function @xmath23 for a two - phase statistically homogeneous medium @xmath1 dimensions is that the @xmath1-dimensional fourier transform of autocovariance @xmath30 , denoted by @xmath31 , must be nonnegative for all wave vectors,@xcite i.e. , @xmath32 where @xmath30 is given by ( [ covariance ] ) .",
    "physically , this nonnegativity condition arises because @xmath31 is proportional to the scattered intensity , which must be positive.@xcite this is sometimes called the wiener ",
    "khintchine condition,@xcite which is necessary but not sufficient for the class @xmath33 of correlation functions that come from binary stochastic processes @xmath12 .",
    "the wiener  khintchine condition is easily proved by exploiting a well - known theorem that states any continuous function @xmath34 must be positive semi - definite in the sense that for any finite number of spatial locations @xmath35 in @xmath36 and arbitrary real numbers @xmath37 , @xmath38 if and only if it has a nonnegative fourier transform @xmath31 .",
    "note that this property does not prevent @xmath30 from being pointwise negative for certain @xmath24 .",
    "importantly , whereas the real - space condition is difficult to check , the spectral version ( [ th - wiener ] ) is straightforward to test .",
    "it is noteworthy that if the medium in @xmath1 dimensions is both statistically homogeneous and isotropic , then the one- , two- , @xmath39 and @xmath1-dimensional fourier transforms of @xmath30 must all be nonnegative.@xcite this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath30 for such a random medium is an invariant in any @xmath40-dimensional subspace , where @xmath41 .",
    "the task of determining the necessary and sufficient conditions that @xmath33 must possess is very complex .",
    "it has been shown that autocovariance functions in @xmath33 must not only meet the condition of ( [ th - wiener ] ) but another condition on `` corner - positive '' matrices.@xcite since little is known about corner - positive matrices , this theorem is very difficult to apply in practice .",
    "thus , a meaningful characterization of @xmath33 remains an open and interesting problem , especially in the context of @xmath1-dimensional two - phase random media .",
    "no attempt will be made to address the complete characterization of @xmath33 here but instead we summarize the known necessary conditions , in addition to condition ( [ th - wiener ] ) , that characterize @xmath33 , most of which are described in ref .",
    "the two - point correlation function must satisfy the bounds @xmath42 the lower bound states that @xmath43 must be nonnegative for all @xmath24 , but we show below that either @xmath44 or @xmath45 must strictly be positive for @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding bounds on the autocovariance function is given by @xcite @xmath47 another consequence of the binary nature of the process in the case of statistically homogeneous and isotropic media , i.e. , when @xmath43 only depends on the distance @xmath48 , is that its derivative at @xmath49 is strictly negative or @xmath50 this is a consequence of the fact that slope at @xmath49 is proportional to the negative of the specific surface.@xcite this means that @xmath51 has a cusp at the origin , implying that the two - point function is nonanalytic at the origin .",
    "it is a property of binary processes that if @xmath52 and @xmath53 are in @xmath33 , then @xmath54 and @xmath55 for every @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "this was proved by shepp@xcite in one dimension , but the proof should extend trivially to @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "a little known necessary condition for statistically homogeneous media is the so - called  triangular inequality \" first derived by shepp @xcite and later rediscovered by matheron:@xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "the derivation of the triangular inequality ( [ tri ] ) is straightforward .",
    "following shepp , we introduce the random variable @xmath59 the mean of @xmath60 is @xmath61 , which is equal to zero if @xmath62 .",

    "@xcite the triangular inequality implies a number of pointwise conditions on the two - point correlation function .",
    "for example , for statistically homogeneous and isotropic media , the triangular inequality implies condition ( [ chi - slope ] ) , the fact that the steepest descent of the two - point correlation function occurs at the origin,@xcite i.e. , @xmath70 and the fact that @xmath51 must convex at the origin,@xcite i.e. , @xmath71 from the  stochastic continuity \" theorem for general stochastic processes,@xcite it follows that if @xmath51 is continuous at @xmath49 , then it is continuous for all @xmath72",
    ". this continuity condition can also be proved using the triangular inequality .",
    "note that @xmath51 can be discontinuous at the origin if the specific surface @xmath73 is infinitely large .",
    "the triangular inequality is actually a special case of the more general condition @xcite @xmath74 this necessary condition is much stronger than ( [ chi - pos ] ) , implying that there are other necessary conditions beyond the ones identified so far .",
    "however , the condition ( [ chi - pos-2 ] ) is difficult to check in practice because it does not have a simple spectral analog in contrast to ( [ chi - pos ] ) [ cf .",
    "( [ th - wiener ] ) ] .",
    "note that the integers @xmath75 in ( [ chi - pos-2 ] ) can be replaced with general integers , which would lead to an even more general condition on @xmath30 .    here",
    "we report a new simple consequence of the lower bound of expression ( [ chi-1 ] ) .",
    "because the autocovariance is the same for phase 1 and phase 2 , then it immediately follows from the lower bound of ( [ chi-1 ] ) that @xmath76 thus , for @xmath77 , @xmath23 is strictly positive such that it must be greater than @xmath78 .",
    "interestingly , the lower bound of ( [ chi-1 ] ) for the autocovariance @xmath34 , first obtained in ref .",
    "3 , was derived from the trivial pointwise nonnegativity condition @xmath79 .",
    "however , the consequences of going back to the two - point correlation function @xmath23 were heretofore not examined . the nontrivial positivity condition ( [ positive ] )",
    "arises because the statistics of phase 1 are not independent of the statistics of phase 2 .",
    "since @xmath80 is the large - distance asymptotic limit of @xmath23 , its globally minimum value or , more precisely , its infimum ( greatest lower bound ) must be less than or equal to @xmath80 .",
    "( technically , one must consider the infimum and not the minimum because the minimum may not actually be achieved , e.g. , a monotonically decreasing function that only asymptotically approaches its minimum value of @xmath80 . ) clearly , the lower bound ( [ positive ] ) holds for the infimum of @xmath23 , which will be denoted by @xmath81 $ ] . in summary",

    "it is convenient to introduce the scaled autocovariance function @xmath83 defined as @xmath84 from ( [ positive ] ) , we obtain the triangular inequality for @xmath85 to be @xmath86 moreover , the bounds ( [ chi-1 ] ) become @xmath87   \\le f({\\bf r } ) \\le 1 \\qquad \\mbox{for all } \\;\\ ; { \\bf r}. \\label{positive-2}\\ ] ]    our focus in this paper will be hypothetical continuous functions @xmath88 that depend on the distance @xmath89 and could potentially correspond to statistically homogeneous and isotropic media without long - range order such that @xmath90 and @xmath88 tends to zero as @xmath91 sufficiently fast so that the fourier transform of @xmath92 exists .",
    "the latter two properties of @xmath88 ensure that @xmath51 obeys its proper asymptotic limiting behaviors as specified by ( [ 0 ] ) and ( [ infty ] ) , respectively .",
    "when the scaled autocovariance @xmath88 depends only on the magnitude @xmath93 , then the fourier transform condition ( [ th - wiener ] ) on @xmath94 can be written in any space dimension @xmath1 as@xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the bessel function of order @xmath98 .",
    "the bounds ( [ min ] ) are equivalent to @xmath87 \\le f_{inf } \\le 0 , \\label{min-2}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the infimum of @xmath88 .",
    "note that when function @xmath88 is independent of the volume fraction @xmath5 , it would correspond , if realizable , to a two - phase medium with _ phase - inversion symmetry_.@xcite a two - phase random medium possesses phase - inversion symmetry if the geometry of phase 1 at volume fraction @xmath5 is statistically identical to that of phase 2 in the system where the volume fraction of phase 1 is @xmath7 and hence @xmath100 by construction , the upper bound of ( [ min-2 ] ) is always satisfied .",
    "all of the functions @xmath88 considered below are taken to be independent of the volume fraction @xmath5 and therefore any violation of the lower bound of ( [ min-2 ] ) implies that a two - phase statistically homogeneous and isotropic medium can not exist for the following volume - fraction intervals @xmath101 figure [ fmin ] depicts the bounds ( [ min-2 ] ) on @xmath99 for @xmath88 that are independent of volume fraction .",
    "first we note that for any @xmath88 that monotonically decreases in @xmath72 to its long - range value of zero , the pointwise nonnegativity condition ( [ positive-2 ] ) is obeyed for @xmath102 .",
    "however , as some examples below will demonstrate , such an @xmath88 does not necessarily obey the triangular inequality ( [ tri-2 ] ) .",
    "a natural example of a monotonic scaled autocovariance function @xmath88 is the simple exponentially decaying function , i.e. , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a positive parameter that we call the  correlation length . \"",
    "this function was first proposed by debye and coworkers,@xcite who intuited that it should correspond to structures in which one phase consists of  random shapes and sizes , \" but presented no proof that such was the case .",
    "the function ( [ debye ] ) obeys the necessary nonnegativity condition ( [ necess ] ) on the spectral function @xmath94 for any @xmath1 as well as the triangular inequality ( [ tri-2 ] ) .",
    "the satisfaction of these necessary conditions does not ensure that such a correlation is realizable .",
    "however , the aforementioned inverse optimization construction technique @xcite was applied to generate a two - dimensional digitized realization corresponding to ( [ debye ] ) ( see figure  [ debye - medium ] ) .",
    "this leads one to believe that ( [ debye ] ) is exactly realizable . indeed , there are specific two - phase microstructures that achieve the `` debye '' random - medium function ( [ debye ] ) in the plane .",
    "@xcite the function ( [ debye ] ) is a special case of a more general realizable subclass of @xmath33 given by the _ completely monotonic",

    "we see that if @xmath110 , then @xmath111 and ( [ debye ] ) is recovered , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the heaviside and dirac delta functions , respectively .",
    "another natural monotonic scaled autocovariance function @xmath88 to consider is the gaussian function , i.e. , @xmath114 . \\label{gaussian}\\ ] ] although any such gaussian function has a nonnegative spectral function @xmath94 , it can not correspond to a two - phase random medium in @xmath36 because the slope of @xmath51 at @xmath49 is zero ( i.e. , the specific surface is zero ) and therefore violates condition ( [ chi - slope ] ) or , more generally , the triangular inequality ( [ tri-2 ] ) . for precisely the same reasons , the class of monotonic functions @xmath115 .",

    "these specific examples , some of which are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ impossible ] , show that the nonnegativity condition ( [ necess ] ) and triangular inequality ( [ tri ] ) are independent necessary conditions .",
    "the final monotone function that we test is the simple linear function @xmath117 shepp @xcite proved that such a scaled autocovariance is realizable by a statistically homogeneous two - phase medium in one dimension .",
    "however , this autocovariance is not realizable in higher dimensions because its spectral function @xmath94 can take on negative values for certain values of @xmath118 .",
    "it is noteworthy that it has been shown that for any positive definite @xmath88 in one dimension , the function @xmath119 as well as @xmath120 are in @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite    a generalization of the debye random - medium function ( [ debye ] ) that is nonmonotone and would be characterized by short - range order is the following expression : @xcite @xmath121 where @xmath122 is an inverse length scale that controls oscillations in the term @xmath123 .",
    "the spectral function @xmath94 of ( [ e10 ] ) in one , two , and three dimensions obeys the nonnegativity condition ( [ necess ] ) .",
    "interestingly , torquato @xcite observed that although ( [ e10 ] ) satisfies the upper bound of binary condition ( [ chi-1 ] ) , it does not necessarily satisfy the lower bound of ( [ chi-1 ] ) or , equivalently , the lower bound of ( [ positive-2 ] ) for all @xmath5 , depending on the values of @xmath104 and @xmath122 .",
    "in other words , there are values of the infimum @xmath99 , which in this case is a true global minimum , that violate the lower bound of ( [ min-2 ] ) .",

    "[ damped - sine ] ) , and therefore , according to ( [ intervals ] ) , ( [ e10 ] ) is not realizable for the volume - fraction intervals @xmath132 interestingly , two realizations of digitized two - dimensional two - phase media were previously constructed @xcite that putatively correspond to the scaled autocovariance function ( [ e10 ] ) for @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively , and the aforementioned choice of @xmath104 and @xmath122 are shown in figure  [ dinko ] . at @xmath133 , the system resembles a _ dilute particle suspension _ with `` particle '' diameters of order @xmath135 . at @xmath136 ,",
    "the resulting pattern is _ labyrinthine _ such that the characteristic sizes of the `` patches '' and `` walls '' are of order @xmath104 and @xmath137 , respectively . for these sets of parameters ,",
    "all of the aforementioned necessary conditions on the function are met , except for the triangular inequality .",
    "although ( [ e10 ] ) satisfies the negative slope condition ( [ chi - slope ] ) at the origin , it only satisfies the convexity condition ( [ convex ] ) for @xmath138 , which we see is violated in these instances , implying that the triangular inequality must be violated .",
    "as it turned out , the construction procedure matched the target function ( [ e10 ] ) for almost all @xmath72 , but it could not yield convex behavior in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "since the triangular inequality was not known at the time , it was difficult to ascertain whether the slight discrepancy in the curvature of the function at the origin was numerical imprecision .",
    "we now know in retrospect that the construction technique was revealing that a two - phase medium with a scaled autocovariance function ( [ e10 ] ) can not be exactly realized , which is a testament to the power of this method .",
    "we have identified all of the known necessary conditions on the two - point correlation function @xmath23 of statistically homogeneous two - phase media and have derived a new but simple positivity condition that it must satisfy . using these conditions",
    ", we were able to ascertain the realizability of certain classes of proposed correlation functions .",
    "in future work , it will be important to identify other checkable necessary conditions .",
    "the stochastic optimization construction technique @xcite appears to be a very powerful numerical tool in guiding such a search . finally , we note that the analogous realizability problem for the pair correlation function @xmath139 of point processes@xcite offers many interesting challenges .",
    "it has recently been conjectured that the known standard non - negativity conditions on @xmath139 are sufficient to ensure the existence of point processes at and above some sufficiently high space dimension@xcite .",
    "application of this conjecture implies the possibility that the densest sphere packings in sufficiently high dimensions are disordered rather than periodic , implying the existence of disordered classical ground states for some continuous potentials . in future work",
    ", it would be interesting to investigate whether an analogous conjecture applies to binary stochastic processes .",
