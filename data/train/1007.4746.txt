    "the mathematical framework underpinning spin chains can be applied to various physical devices ; these could be made of any components whose states can be mapped onto spin @xmath0 particles interacting with their neighbors .",

    "an important question to ask is how and to what extent a time delay in input operations would alter the transmission fidelity .",
    "this question is particularly important for multiple excitations : for a single excitation a delayed injection would not alter the overall state evolution , but there would be merely an overall time shift . for multiple excitations",
    "however , it may occur that during the preparation of a state @xmath124 , with @xmath125 , not all input sites are accessed at exactly the same time . as a consequence",
    "a system which is supposed to be prepared in a two - excitation state may start evolving as a one excitation system if the two required excitations are not injected in synchrony .",
    "+ let us focus on the latter case .",
    "when considering such a delayed input there is a finite probability that the second spin @xmath38 we want to inject an excitation into is already occupied .",
    "the result of this scenario is dependent on the injection mechanism , so we will consider the two main possibilities : ( i ) spin excitation via a rabi - flopping control pulse on spin @xmath38 ",
    "applicable for example to systems in which excitations correspond to ground state excitons confined within a quantum dot chain or to flipping the spin of an electron already confined within the chain  and ( ii ) injection via swap operation or injection of an additional particle in the chain .",
    "the latter may correspond e.g. to the scenario in which the state in the qubit of register @xmath38 closest to the spin chain ( see fig . [ diag ] ) is swapped with the state in the chain site @xmath38 ",
    "e.g. via a train of laser pulses in the case of exciton qubits ( see @xcite )  or to the scenario in which the main computation occurs via coherent electron transport in quantum wires ( such as in @xcite ) , each connected to a spin chain site .    in case ( i )",
    "injecting an excitation corresponds to applying a @xmath126-pulse using the hamiltonian @xmath127 with @xmath128 the rabi frequency ( we assume that qubits can be manipulated on an individual basis ) .",
    "accordingly , at the delayed injection of the second excitation , the system state will evolve as @xmath129 with @xmath130 for @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "fig : delay_6_rs](a ) ) .",
    "if the desired dynamics is such that a certain site @xmath121 has unit probability to contain an excitation at a later time @xmath134 though , the system can be refocused by measuring site @xmath121 at @xmath134 : a result of  excitation present \" would collapse the system state into two - excitation dynamics , which is the closer to the desired dynamics the smaller the delay ; a result of  no - excitation present \" would imply that the chain contains indeed no excitation at all .",
    "we underline that the latter result could be used as a protocol to reinitialize the chain itself .    in case ( ii )",
    "the scenario is very different .",
    "should the first excitation already have a non - zero probability of occupying site @xmath38 , the second excitation will have a related probability of remaining in the register .",
    "the register would then become entangled with the spin chain . the injection process can in fact",
    "be described as follows ( where we assume that the presence of the excitation in site @xmath38 is the only cause of failed injection ) @xmath135 with @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",

    "[ fig:6spin2exdelays ] , we give an overview of various possible delay scenarios , assuming input by swap operation with error correction by measurement of the injecting register or wire performed immediately after the attempted injection of the second excitation . in panel ( a ) , the delay of the second excitation is equal to @xmath138 .",
    "even with the error correction measurement we see an impact on the system as the delay between the two injections puts a cap on the fidelity of the revivals of the desired two - excitation input state .",
    "the larger the delay ( up to the mirror time @xmath88 ) , the more serious the impact .",
    "frame ( b ) demonstrates that even if timely simultaneous injection were not possible , the ability to inject the second excitation an integer number of periods @xmath137 after the first one would allow for perfect revivals .",
    "in contrast , the third frame ( c ) shows that a second injection exactly @xmath88 away from the ideal case would result in the total decay of the desired state .",
    "however , we have to keep in mind that at @xmath55 where @xmath139 has the lowest fidelity , the corresponding twin state will be achieving perfect fidelity and that therefore a new state will emerge , we illustrate this in fig .",

    "this state then continues to evolve with its twin state @xmath143 , both of them alternately reaching perfect fidelity .",
    "the additional features on the plots of vectors with two excitations , as well as the narrowing of the main peak are due to excitation of the particular superpositions of energy eigenstates in the two - excitation subspace that correspond to our initial state .",
    "this shows how we can use delayed input to transfer states which are different from the `` twin '' sites of the input sites while still assuring pst",

    "the peak of @xmath148 at @xmath149 reaches unity.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      imperfect injection can occur even without delays between different excitations injections due to other device imperfections .",
    "a typical example could be the possibility that in the swap injection scenario one of the two excitations is partially reflected into the wire .",
    "this may occur in a device in which the spin chain is formed by gate - defined quantum dots where electrons are injected via ( computational ) wires , with the reflection being caused by imperfect lowering of a potential barrier between the wire and the selected spin chain site @xmath38 . in this case the injection would be described by @xmath150 where the first spin has been perfectly injected at site @xmath121 , while there is a reflection probability @xmath151 associated with spin @xmath38 . in this scenario measuring the absence ( presence ) of excitation in the register after injection would ensure that the chain is undergoing exactly the desired dynamics ( or that the chain is ready for re - injecting the second excitation at the closest suitable time ) .",
    "the above scenario can be straightforwardly extended to the case in which a finite probability of reflection is associated with both injection sites .",
    "+ while in this paper we are only discussing delays at the input stage , similar problems may arise of course at read - out , should the extraction of a state covering multiple sites not be as timely as we would hope it to be .",
    "it is also worth noting that any peak following delayed input is shifted forward in time linearly with increasing delay .      when considering imperfect or non - synchronous input and entanglement transfer , we see a similar effect to that on unentangled states .",
    "again , as the overall desired system state is more complicated , we monitor the evolution of the amount of entanglement in the relevant sub - system , instead of individual vectors . in fig .",

    "as long as the second injection is only delayed by a small fraction of @xmath88 , the first excitation will not have spread out far enough yet to affect the second injection site .",
    "we see that even for delays as large as @xmath152 , the system retains over 90% of its possible entanglement .     vs. input delay for an 8-spin chain with initial input state @xmath101 for both rabi flopping and swap operation type of injections.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "when we consider two adjacent injection sites , there is instead a clear discrepancy between the decay in entanglement of formation in a chain with input via rabi flopping or swap operation ( fig [ fig:0110delay ] ) .",
    "again , we assume that there is an instantaneous swap correction protocol applied , while refocussing after the rabi - flopping is not possible . as in the case of non - synchronous input in unentangled states , a delay in a swap type injection perturbs the system far less than using rabi flopping , and shows virtually no loss in the amount of entanglement in the system , even for delays as large as @xmath153 .",
    "if instead rabi flopping is used , the decay in eof is similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : gatedelay ] .     for both swap operation and rabi flopping type injections.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in this paper we have considered a variety of physically relevant perturbative factors in spin chains .",
    "we have investigated in detail their effects on information transfer and entanglement generation and transfer . for different forms of perturbation , the results of our extensive numerical studies on the quality of transfer can be captured with a straightforward analytic expression that demonstrates exponential damping with the number of spins on the chain and gaussian dependence on the relevant perturbation parameter .",
    "this expression provides a simple tool for estimating the efficiency of a chain under the action of perturbations .",
    "we have also related our dimensionless perturbation parameter scales to actual parameters for candidate spin chain realizations such as quantum dots with exciton qubits and graphene dots with spin qubits , providing a calibration of our estimator tool for these experimental systems .",
    "we have considered the transport of both unentangled states as well as entangled states via spin chains , subject to various forms of perturbation , and a general conclusion is that next - nearest neighbor interactions are the most damaging to transfer fidelity or eof .",
    "the reason for this can be traced back to the fact that the next - nearest neighbor interaction is the only perturbation that effectively opens up new ` channels ' for the system dynamics . by connecting sites which would otherwise be disconnected ( at the same order in perturbation )",
    ", it allows a more efficient ( in a detrimental sense ) ` spread ' of excitations , and consequently drastically diminishes the occurrence of quantum coherent effects such as revivals and pst . in particular",
    ", we have seen that the introduction of next - nearest neighbor coupling may lead to non - negligible quality loss after only a few periods .",
    "systems with simpler input states are generally slightly less affected than those of a slightly more complex nature but as different perturbation factors affect different excitation subspaces , there is no clear advantage of one particular type of state in terms of robustness . however , for all fabrication defects considered we have found that the transport during the first period remains of high quality for perturbation amplitudes of the order of few percent , while the periodicity itself may be destroyed for next - nearest neighbor couplings above about @xmath154 .",
    "this is of particular concern for schemes based on dipole - dipole interactions , where , for roughly equidistant sites , the next - nearest neighbor interactions are of the order of @xmath155 .",
    "nevertheless , due to the gaussian dependence of transport efficiency on perturbation amplitudes , provided that the perturbations are kept below these few percent thresholds , spin chains are demonstrated to be very good candidates for the implementation of solid state quantum information processing devices , robust against various forms of perturbation .",
    "additionally , we have seen that the effect of imperfect input or injection operations leads to a permanent ( but constant ) loss in information transport quality and entanglement generation . for input delayed by a time",
    "approaching the mirroring time @xmath88 the transport of the intended state is replaced by a new input state , which is then subject to the system dynamics as per usual .",
    "furthermore , there is a fundamental difference between the two input methods we have considered .",
    "if rabi flopping is used and the injection of the second excitation is delayed , the error induced by the imperfect input remains in the system , except if a site is expected to be in state @xmath156 at a known time , when measurement of this site can recover dynamics close to the ideal case . in the case of input by swap operation",
    ", the error can be dramatically reduced by subsequent measuring of the environment .",
    "when considering swap type injection , unentangled states and type ( i ) entanglement states are remarkably robust against non - synchronous injection , with hardly any loss in fidelity even for large delays . type ( ii )",
    "dynamically - generated entangled states are instead more affected due to their more complex set - up . even so the loss in eof remains less than 10% for delay values up to 10% of the mirroring time @xmath88 .",
    "our studies demonstrate quantitatively the criteria that need to be met , in terms of perturbation scales and injection errors , for imperfect spin chains to work efficiently as quantum information transfer and entanglement transfer / generation devices . with modest errors at or below the few percent level , spin chains prove to be good and robust devices , which is very encouraging for future experiments on these systems .",
