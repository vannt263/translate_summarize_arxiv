    "transport phenomena in unconventional superconductors have attracted considerable interst in recent years because high-@xmath0 superconductors may have the @xmath1 wave pairing symmetry .",
    "@xcite the unconventional pairing symmetry causes the anisotropy in transport properties such as the electric conductance and the thermal conductivity .",
    "@xcite in normal - metal / high-@xmath0 superconductor junctions , for instance , the shape of the differential conductance reflects the density of states when the @xmath2 axis of high-@xmath0 materials is perpendicular to the junction interface .",
    "when @xmath2 axis deviates from the interface normal , on the other hand , the conductance shows a large peak at the zero bias - voltage .",
    "@xcite such anisotropy in the conductance is now explained by the formation of a zero - energy state ( zes )  @xcite at the interface of junctions .",
    "since the zes appears just on the fermi energy , it drastically affects transport properties through the interface of unconventional superconductor junctions .",
    "the low - temperature anomaly of the josephson current between the two unconventional superconductors is explained in terms of the resonant tunneling of cooper pairs via the zes .",
    "@xcite so far a considerable number of studies have been made on the zes itself and related phenomena of transport properties in both spin - singlet and spin - triplet unconventional superconductor junctions .",
    "@xcite    the conductance in normal - metal / superconductor ( ns ) junctions is calculated from the normal and the andreev reflection  @xcite coefficients which are obtained by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation  @xcite under appropriate boundary conditions at the junction interface .",
    "consequently we easily find the zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) in ns junctions of high-@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "@xcite although the algebra itself is straightforward , it is not easy to understand the physics behind the calculation . in a previous paper ,",
    "@xcite we briefly discussed reasons for the appearance of the zbcp by a phenomenological argument .",
    "the phenomenological analysis has several advantages .",
    "for instance , it shows the importance of the unconventional pairing symmetry for the formation of the zes without directly solving the bdg equation .",
    "moreover we easily understand that the zes is a result of the interference effect of a quasiparticle .",
    "the applicability of the analysis in the previous paper , however , is very limited because of its simplicity .    in this paper",
    ", we reconstruct the phenomenological theory of the andreev reflection to meet the mathematical accuracy .",
    "we calculate the reflection coefficients of an electronlike quasiparticle incident from a normal metal into a ns interface . near the junction interface ,",
    "a quasiparticle suffers two kinds of reflection : ( i ) the normal reflection by the barrier potential at the ns interface and ( ii ) the andreev reflection by the pair potential in the superconductor . in the present theory",

    "the andreev reflection coefficient is decomposed into a series expansion with respect to the normal reflection probability of ns junctions .",
    "the expression of the andreev reflection probability enables us to understand the importance of the unconventional pairing symmetry for the formation of the zes . in unconventional superconductors ,",
    "the pair potential in the electron branch ( @xmath3 ) differs from that in the hole branch ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the andreev reflection probability at the zero - energy is expressed as the summation of the alternating series when @xmath3 and @xmath4 have the same sign with each other . in this case",
    ", the zero - bias conductance becomes a small value proportional to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the normal transmission probability of junctions . on the other hand",
    "when @xmath7 , all the expansion series have the same sign and the conductance has a large peak at the zero - bias .",
