    "this paper is concerned with reed - frost epidemics modified to take place on random networks . introduced in 1928 by two medical researchers , lowell reed and wade frost , the reed - frost model is one of the simplest stochastic epidemic models .",
    "the spread of the infection takes place in generations : each individual that is infective at time @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) independently makes contacts with all other individuals in the population with some probability @xmath2 , and if a contacted individual is susceptible , it becomes infected at time @xmath3 .",
    "also at time @xmath3 , the infective individuals from time @xmath0 are removed from the epidemic process .",
    "the behavior of the reed - frost model is well understood , see e.g.von bahr and martin - lf ( 1980 ) . a crucial assumption which simplifies",
    "the analysis of the model is that the population in which the epidemic takes place is taken to be homogeneously mixing , that is , an infective individual is assumed to make contacts with all other individuals in the population with the same probability .",
    "this assumption is of course very unrealistic , since , in a real - life epidemic , an infective individual is much more likely to infect individuals with whom he / she has some kind of social connection .",
    "the reed - frost model can easily be adapted to incorporate this type of heterogeneity by introducing a graph to represent the social structure in the population and then stipulating that infective individuals can only infect their neighbors in the social network ; see section 3 .",
    "this modification makes the analysis of the model two - fold .",
    "firstly , one wants to find a realistic model for the underlying social network , and , secondly , one wants to study the behavior of the epidemic on this graph .",
    "large complex networks such as social contact structures , the internet and various types of collaboration networks have received a lot of attention during the last few years ; see e.g.dorogovtsev and mendes ( 2003 ) and newman et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and the references therein . as for social networks ,",
    "one of their most striking features is that they are highly clustered , meaning roughly that there is a large number of triangles and other short cycles ; see e.g.  newman ( 2003 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that friendship circles are typically strongly overlapping so that many of our friends are also friends of each other .",
    "a model that captures this in a natural way is the so called random intersection graph , which is described in section 2 .",
    "roughly , the idea of the model is that people are members of groups  families , schools , workplaces etc .",
    " and an edge is drawn between two individuals if they share at least one group . if the relation between the number of individuals and the number of groups is chosen appropriately , this leads to a graph where the amount of clustering can be tuned by adjusting the parameters of the model .",
    "an important goal of network modelling is to investigate how the structure of the network affects the behavior of various types of dynamic processes on the network ; see durrett ( 2006 ) for an overview . when it comes to epidemics , andersson ( 1999 )",
    "is a comprehensible introduction , in which expressions for the epidemic threshold , the probability of a large outbreak and the final size of the epidemic are derived in a heuristic way for a number of underlying graphs . here",
    ", the epidemic threshold , commonly denoted by @xmath4 , is defined as a function of the parameters of the model such that a large outbreak in the epidemic has positive probability if and only if @xmath5 . in epidemic modelling ,",
    "a common technique for deriving expressions for the epidemic threshold and the probability of a large outbreak is to use branching process approximations of the early stages of the epidemic .",
    "however , when studying epidemics on networks , dependencies between the edges in the graph tend to make branching process approximations more complicated .",
    "results for epidemics on graphs with arbitrary degree distribution can be found in andersson ( 1998 ) , and erds - rnyi graphs and some extensions thereof are dealt with in neal ( 2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "there is however very little work done on more complicated graph structures .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a rigorous analysis of how clustering in a network affects the spread of an epidemic .",
    "the network is modelled by a random intersection graph with tunable clustering and we then let a reed - frost epidemic propagate on this graph .",
    "comparing the epidemic with a certain branching process yields ( implicit ) expressions for the epidemic threshold and the probability of a large outbreak .",
    "numerical evaluations reveal that , as the clustering increases , the epidemic threshold decreases  that is , large outbreaks are possible for larger parts of the parameter space  but also that the actual value of the probability of a large outbreak decreases as the clustering approaches its maximal value . to our knowledge , this is the first rigorous investigation of how the spread of an epidemic is affected by clustering .    in newman ( 2003:2 )",
    ", the effect of clustering on epidemics is studied by heuristic means , and calculations therein indicate that indeed the epidemic threshold should decrease as the clustering increase .",
    "furthermore , trapman ( 2007 ) studies epidemics on graphs with a given expected number of triangles , but the construction of the graph is more involved there .",
    "we mention also the work by ball et al .",
    "( 1997 ) on the so called household model , which describes the spread of an epidemic in a population with group structure .",
    "the model there however is not formulated in terms of an underlying graph and the concept of clustering is not considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , random intersection graphs and their properties",
    "are described in more detail .",
    "section 3 contains the main result  a comparison of a reed - frost epidemic on a random intersection graph with a branching process  and its proof . in section 4 , the final size of the epidemic",
    "is commented on .",
    "it is observed that a thinned random intersection graph is in fact not a random intersection graph , implying that results concerning the component structure in a random intersection graph can not be used to draw conclusions about the final size of the epidemic . in section 5 ,",
    "numerical results are presented and , finally , section 6 contains a short discussion .",
    "random intersection graphs were introduced in singer ( 1995 ) and karoski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in its simplest form",
    ", the model is defined as follows : given a set @xmath6 of @xmath7 vertices and a set @xmath8 of @xmath9 auxiliary vertices , construct a bipartite graph @xmath10 by letting each edge between vertices @xmath11 and @xmath12 exist independently with probability @xmath13 . the random intersection graph @xmath14 with vertex set @xmath6 is obtained by connecting two vertices @xmath15 if and only if there is a vertex @xmath12 such that @xmath16 is linked to both @xmath17 and @xmath18 in @xmath10 .",
    "this construction can be generalized in various ways  see e.g.  godehardt and jaworski ( 2002 ) and deijfen and kets ( 2007 )  but in this paper we will stick to the above formulation .",
    "we will also specialize to the case when @xmath19 for some constants @xmath20 ; see karoski et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) for a motivation of this choice of @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , to get a graph with tunable clustering , we will soon take @xmath21 .",
    "if the vertices in @xmath6 and @xmath8 are thought of as individuals and groups respectively , then the random intersection graph provides a model for a social network where individuals are connected if there is at least one group where they are both members .",
    "the probability that two individuals do not share any group is @xmath22 , implying that the edge probability in the random intersection graph is @xmath23 , and hence the expected degree of a fixed vertex is @xmath24 to keep this expression bounded as @xmath25 , we let @xmath26 for some @xmath27 .",
    "the expected degree then tends to @xmath28 as @xmath25 .    as for the asymptotic distribution of the vertex degree with the above choices of @xmath9 and @xmath13 , it is shown in stark ( 2004 ) to be a point mass at 0 for @xmath29 , a compound poisson distribution , describing the law of a sum of a poisson(@xmath30 ) distributed number of independent poisson(@xmath31 ) variables for @xmath21 , and a poisson(@xmath28 ) distribution for @xmath32 . to see this , note that the number of groups that an individual belongs to is binomially distributed with mean @xmath33 . for @xmath29 ,",
    "this goes to 0 as @xmath25 , explaining the point mass at 0 . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the number of group memberships per individual is asymptotically poisson(@xmath30 ) distributed , and the sizes of the groups are poisson(@xmath31 ) , with overlaps between groups being very unlikely if @xmath7 is large , indicating that the degree distribution should indeed be compound poisson . when @xmath32 , each individual belongs to infinitely many groups as @xmath25",
    "this means that the edge indicators are asymptotically independent , which suggests a poisson distribution for the vertex degree .",
    "in fact , for @xmath32 , the random intersection graph is similar to the standard erds - rnyi random graph ; see fill et al.(2000 ) .    moving on to the clustering in the graph , for two vertices @xmath15 , let @xmath34 denote the edge indicator for the edge between @xmath17 and @xmath18 in @xmath14 , and write @xmath35 for the probability measure of @xmath14 .",
    "we then define the clustering as @xmath36 that is , @xmath37 is the limiting conditional probability that there is an edge between two vertices @xmath17 and @xmath18 , given that they have a common neighbor @xmath38 .",
    "the expected number of groups that individual @xmath38 belongs to is @xmath39 , which goes to 0 , @xmath30 or infinity , depending on whether @xmath29 , @xmath21 or @xmath32 . as a consequence ,",
    "the limiting probability that two individuals @xmath17 and @xmath18 who both share a group with @xmath38 in fact share the _ same _ group with @xmath38  thus being connected to each other  will behave differently depending on the value of @xmath40 .",
    "more specifically , it is shown in deijfen and kets ( 2007 ) that @xmath41 in view of the result from stark ( 2004 ) concerning the degree distribution and the characterization of the clustering from deijfen and kets ( 2007 ) , the best choice if we want to use a random intersection graph to describe a social network seems to be @xmath21 .",
    "this gives rise to a model where both the mean degree and the clustering can be tuned by adjusting the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath31 .",
    "more precisely , with @xmath43 denoting the limiting degree of a fixed vertex , we have that @xmath44=\\beta\\gamma^2\\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad c=(1+\\beta\\gamma)^{-1}.\\ ] ] for the remainder of this paper we fix @xmath21 and write @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the corresponding random intersection graph and its underlying bipartite graph ( omitting the subscripts when the dependence on @xmath42 and @xmath31 does not need to be emphasized ) .",
    "consider a closed homogeneous population consisting of @xmath7 individuals , labelled @xmath47 , with a social structure represented by a random intersection graph @xmath48 .",
    "we will use the reed - frost dynamics to describe the spread of an infection in this population .",
    "the social graph @xmath48 is assumed to be fixed throughout the spread of the infection .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity , we start with one single randomly selected infective individual at time 0 , the rest of the population being susceptible . without loss of generality , we assume that the initial infective , which will be referred to as the index case , is individual @xmath49 .",
    "an individual that is infective at time @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) contacts each one of its neighbors in @xmath48 independently with some probability @xmath2 , and if a contacted neighbor is susceptible , it becomes infective at time @xmath3 .",
    "the individuals that were infective at time @xmath0 are removed from the epidemic process at time @xmath3 ( by immunity or death ) and take no further part in the spread of the infection .",
    "we will be concerned with the set @xmath50 of individuals that are ultimately affected by the above epidemic .",
    "more precisely , we will construct a branching process that can be used to determine whether @xmath50 is finite or infinite in the limit as @xmath25 .",
    "to this end , first note that @xmath50 can be identified with the cluster containing the index case in an edge percolation process on @xmath48 in which each edge is open independently with probability @xmath2 .",
    "open edges in the percolation process are interpreted as possible transmission links for the disease , that is , if one of the vertices of an edge is infective at time @xmath0 and the other one is not , then the uninfected vertex becomes infective at time @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , if we consider the percolation cluster of a particular vertex restricted to a subgraph of @xmath48 , then the size of this cluster has the same distribution as the final size of a reed - frost epidemic on the subgraph . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath51 is the size of the percolation cluster of a given vertex belonging to a complete subgraph with @xmath52 nodes , then the distribution of @xmath51 , denoted by @xmath53 , is that of a reed - frost epidemic initiated by one single individual in a homogeneously mixing population of size @xmath52 .",
    "the distribution @xmath53 can be computed recursively ; see andersson and britton ( 2000 : section 1.2 ) .",
    "we now define the branching process that will be used to approximate the epidemic process . to begin with ,",
    "note that the groups in a random intersection graph generate complete subgraphs with sizes that are asymptotically poisson(@xmath31 ) distributed .",
    "hence , in the limit as @xmath25 , the size of an outbreak started by a given individual in a given group is    @xmath54    recall that the number of groups that a given individual is a member of is asymptotically poisson(@xmath30 ) distributed .",
    "let @xmath55 be the generating function of a sum of a poisson(@xmath30 ) number of i.i.d .",

    "this proves the theorem .",
    "the branching process approach from the previous section gives basically no information on the behavior of the epidemic in the case of explosion . in this section",
    "we will elaborate a bit on this problem .    as already described , one way of getting a grip of the final outcome of the epidemic , is to consider an edge percolation process on the underlying graph , where each edge in the graph is independently removed with probability @xmath172 and kept with probability @xmath2 .",
    "the vertices that belong to the component of the initial infective in the graph so obtained correspond to the individuals that have experienced the infection at the end of the epidemic .",
    "if the structure of the thinned graph is known , then this observation might be useful in investigating the final size of the epidemic .",
    "for instance , if there is a unique giant component in the thinned graph  that is , if the outcome of the percolation process contains a unique cluster of order @xmath7  then the relative size of this component gives the probability of an outbreak of order @xmath7 in the epidemic .",
    "such an outbreak is often referred to as a major outbreak , and , in most epidemic models , the probability of such an outbreak coincides with the probability of explosion in the branching process describing the initial stages of the epidemic ( denoted by @xmath73 in this paper ) .",
    "this however require additional arguments .    in our case ,",
    "the social network is a random intersection graph with @xmath21 .",
    "unfortunately , to date there are no rigorous results concerning the component structure in a random intersection graph with @xmath21 , but see behrisch ( 2007 ) for results when @xmath173 .",
    "also , in newman ( 2003:2 ) , ( implicit ) expressions for the size of the largest component in a random graph construction which is similar to the random intersection graph are derived by heuristic means and it is observed that the relative final size of the giant component seems to decrease as the clustering in the graph increases . an argument in support of the claim that high clustering in a graph causes the components to be small is the following : consider an arbitrary graph with @xmath7 vertices and @xmath174 edges and assume that the clustering equals 1 .",
    "this implies that all subgraphs are complete .",
    "hence , with @xmath175 denoting the size of the largest subgraph , we have that the number of edges in the maximal subgraph is @xmath176",
    ". it follows that @xmath177 , that is , the relative size of the largest component tends to zero ,    indeed , the lack of rigorous results concerning the components in a random intersection graph with @xmath21 makes it harder to study the final size of an epidemic on such a graph .",
    "a second complicating circumstance is that thinning a random intersection graph gives rise to a graph that no longer belongs to the class of random intersection graphs ; see the below proposition .",
    "this means that , even if there would be results for the component structure , these would not be applicable to a thinned graph . hence it remains an open problem to quantify the final outcome of the epidemic .",
    "let @xmath178 denote the graph generated by removing edges in @xmath179 independently with probability @xmath172 .",
    "it does not exist @xmath180 and @xmath181 such that @xmath182 for every @xmath7 .",
    "* the idea of the proof is to observe that certain types of subgraphs will appear with different frequency in @xmath178 as compared to @xmath179 .",
    "the subgraph that we will consider consists of four vertices and five edges : @xmath183 \\ar@{-}[dr ] \\ar@{-}[r ] & { \\bullet } \\ar@{-}[d]\\\\ { \\bullet } \\ar@{-}[r ] & { \\bullet } } \\ ] ] write @xmath184 for this graph type , and note that it can be obtained for instance by removing one edge from a complete subgraph with four vertices , a graph type that we denote by @xmath185 .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the term _ vertex - induced _ subgraph , for a subgraph of some given graph such that the subgraph consists of a subset of the vertices in the original graph together with all edges between these vertices that are present in the original graph .    the number @xmath186 of vertex - induced subgraphs of type @xmath187 in the random intersection graph @xmath179 dominates the number of groups of size four in the construction of the random intersection graph . since the size of a fixed group is @xmath188 distributed ,",
    "the number of groups of size four is @xmath189 distributed , and hence @xmath190 \\geq o(n)$ ] .",
    "it follows that the number @xmath191 of vertex - induced subgraphs of type @xmath184 in the thinned graph @xmath192 is also at least of the order @xmath7 , since , as mentioned , one way of obtaining graphs of type @xmath184 is to remove one edge in graphs of type @xmath187 , that is , @xmath193 \\ge ( 1-p)p^{5}\\e[x_4 ] \\geq o(n)$ ] .",

    "this number is related to the number of ways that four individuals @xmath196 can be assigned to different groups so that a graph of type @xmath184 is obtained .",
    "consider for instance the following graph of type @xmath184 : @xmath197 \\ar@{-}[dr ] \\ar@{-}[r ] & { \\bullet } \\ar@{-}[d ] & \\hspace{-18 mm } { } ^{v_{2}}\\\\ { } _ { v_{3}}\\hspace{-18 mm } & { \\bullet } \\ar@{-}[r ] & { \\bullet } & \\hspace{-18 mm } { } _ { v_{4 } } } \\ ] ] write @xmath198 for the event that @xmath199 and @xmath200 share a group , that @xmath201 and @xmath202 share _ another _ group and that @xmath203 and @xmath204 share yet another group .",
    "then , for the above graph to arise , the individuals @xmath205 and @xmath206 can not share any group  the probability that they avoid doing so goes to 1 as @xmath25  and , in addition , one of the following events must occur : @xmath207 it follows that @xmath208 & \\le n^4\\binom{\\lfloor \\beta n \\rfloor}{2}(\\gamma / n)^{6 } + 2n^4\\binom{\\lfloor \\beta n \\rfloor}{3}(\\gamma / n)^{7 } \\\\ & + n^4\\binom{\\lfloor \\beta n \\rfloor}{5}(\\gamma / n)^{10 } = o(1).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the number of vertex - induced subgraphs of type @xmath184 in a random intersection graph is hence finite , while , in a thinned random intersection graph , it is of order @xmath7 .",

    " see e.g.  andersson and britton ( 2000 : section 1.2 )  numerical values of @xmath4 and @xmath73 are easily obtained for fixed values of @xmath42 and @xmath31 .",
    "we are particularly interested in how @xmath65 and @xmath217 are affected when the ( asymptotic ) clustering @xmath218 is varied , and , to be able to compare results for different values of @xmath37 , the mean degree @xmath219 in the graph is kept fixed . in figure 1 , the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath73 are plotted against @xmath37 for three different values of the infection probability @xmath2 .",
    "let us comment a bit on these plots .",
    "first we investigate the value of @xmath4 in the limit as @xmath220 . since @xmath221 is fixed , we have that @xmath222 implies that @xmath223 as well .",
    "asymptotically , the degree distribution in our random intersection graph is compound poisson with generating function @xmath224 which converges to @xmath225 as @xmath226 .",
    "the limiting degree distribution as @xmath220 is hence poisson(@xmath221 ) , and , after thinning the graph , removing each edge independently with probability @xmath172 , the degrees are poisson distributed with mean @xmath227 . since the graph obtained by such a thinning",
    "can be thought of as representing the outcome of the epidemic , it is reasonable to suspect that @xmath228 in the limit as @xmath220 .",
    "indeed , it can be seen in the top plot in figure [ figuren ] that @xmath229 as @xmath230 .    in the top plot in figure 1",
    ", it can also be seen that @xmath4 increases with @xmath37 , that is , higher clustering makes it easier for epidemics to take off .",
    "this is in line with findings in newman ( 2003:2 ) .",
    "let us give a heuristic explanation of why this should be the case : first note that , since the mean degree @xmath221 in the graph is fixed , an increase in @xmath231 is equivalent to an increase in @xmath31 and a decrease in @xmath42 of the order @xmath232 . also , recall that the mean number of groups that an individual is a member of is @xmath30 and the mean group size is @xmath31 . hence , increased clustering with fixed mean degree means that individuals are members of fewer but larger groups . combining this with the observation that the probability for an individual to avoid infection from some index case with whom he / she shares a group decreases geometrically with the group size , it follows that it should be easier for an epidemic to take off when the clustering is large .",
    "in fact , we have that @xmath233 as @xmath234 , that is , in the limit of large clustering , the infection probability @xmath2 does not matter ( as long as it is positive ) for the value of @xmath4 .",
    "the bottom plot in figure 1 shows how the probability @xmath73 of explosion in the epidemic varies with @xmath37 .",
    "for instance , it can be seen that @xmath235 as @xmath236 . in section 4 ,",
    "we argued that the relative size of the largest component in a graph with maximal clustering is 0 in the limit of large graph size .",
    "if the probability of explosion in the epidemic coincides with the relative size of the largest component in the graph representing the outcome of the epidemic , then indeed it follows from this that @xmath235 as @xmath236 .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to note that the decrease of @xmath73 towards 0 is not monotone for all values of @xmath2 . clearly , if a low value of @xmath37 prevents explosion , while explosion is possible for a larger value of @xmath37",
    " this is the case for instance for @xmath237  then we will see an increase in @xmath73 from 0 to a positive value when the threshold is passed .",
    "but , as the curve for @xmath238 reveals , even if @xmath73 is positive already at @xmath239 , it can be the case that it increases with @xmath37 in some interval before it starts to decrease .",
    "in the present paper , we have analyzed how the clustering in a random network affects how an infectious disease propagates in the network , assuming the size of the network to be large .",
    "in particular , using a random intersection graph construction , we have rigorously derived the limiting probability of an explosion in the epidemic and a threshold parameter indicating if this probability is 0 or positive .",
    "the motivation for analyzing an epidemic on a random network with positive clustering is of course that most empirical social networks manifest positive clustering , so predictions based on epidemic models neglecting such clustering , i.e.  most epidemic models , must be interpreted with caution .",
    "there are of course several other features in empirical networks , not considered in the present paper , that should also be taken into account for predictions to be reliable .",
    "one such feature is the degree distribution , which in many social networks has been observed to follow a power - law distribution .",
    "the graph model used in this paper gives compound poisson distributions for the degrees , but the model is generalized in deijfen and kets ( 2007 ) to allow for power - law degree distributions .",
    "it would be interesting to study how an epidemic on such a generalized graph is affected by the exponent in the power - law .",
    "another feature that has been observed in many social networks is positive degree correlation , that is , individuals with high ( low ) degree tend to be connected to other individuals with high ( low ) degree .",
    "because of the group structure , this is likely to be the case in a random intersection graph , but it remains to quantify the correlation .    a possible generalization of the studied model would be to distinguish between different types of individuals , and to assume that both network characteristics as well as transmission probabilities depend on the type of an individual ; see e.g.  ball and clancy ( 1993 ) .",
    "another extension , motivated by real - world epidemics , is to leave the reed - frost paradigm , in which the events that different neighbors of a given infective becomes infected are independent .",
    "if for example the infectious period is taken to be random , then these events are positively correlated ; see e.g.  andersson and britton ( 2000 ) .",
    "unfortunately , by relaxing the independence assumption the analysis of the model becomes much more complicated .",
    "perhaps the most obvious continuation of the present work is however to derive fully rigorous results about the final size of the epidemic in case of explosion .",
    "the ( relative ) final _ size _ of the epidemic then most likely coincides with the _ probability _ of explosion , a quantity derived in the present paper , but a proof of this is still missing .",
