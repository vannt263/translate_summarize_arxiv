    "the one confirmed transiting planet discovered to date , hd209458b @xcite , lies only @xmath5 from its host g star , and therefore well inside the so - called `` habitable zone '' , where water could exist in its liquid state .",
    "all ongoing transit surveys are primarily sensitive to such `` hot jupiters '' because their large diameters give rise to relatively strong @xmath6 signals , while their proximity to their host increases the probability of transits occurring @xcite .",
    "while gas giants are not expected to themselves be habitable regardless of their location , they could have water - laden moons like europa , ganymede , and callisto , which could support life if the planet lay in the habitable zone .",
    "future ground - based surveys could be sensitive to such habitable - zone giant planets . moreover , the planned _ kepler _ mission has as its primary goal the detection of planets down to earth size in or near the habitable zone .",
    "the _ kepler _ targets would be even more direct analogs of the earth .    here",
    "we investigate the sensitivity of transit surveys to planets in the habitable zone as a function of stellar type .",
    "we derive two remarkable conclusions .",
    "first , transit surveys are most sensitive to habitable planets orbiting middle m stars ( @xmath7 ) , despite the fact that they are most sensitive overall to planets orbiting early g stars ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "second , to achieve this sensitivity to dim stars , the survey s magnitude limit must be an extremely strong function of spectral type .",
    "specifically , it must be about 7 magnitudes fainter for middle m stars than g stars . since such variable requirements can significantly affect survey design",
    ", they deserve careful analysis and consideration .",
    "for example , we show that unless the _ kepler _ mission extends its magnitude limit for m stars well beyond its current ( type independent ) limit of @xmath9 , it will lose most of its potential sensitivity to habitable planets .",
    "@xcite showed that if every star of luminosity @xmath10 and radius @xmath11 has a planet of radius @xmath12 in a circular orbit of semi - major axis @xmath13 , then a photon - noise limited transit survey will detect @xmath14 planets . here",
    "@xmath15 is the number density of stars of the specified type , @xmath16 is the angular area of the survey , and @xmath17 is the distance out to which an equatorial transit can just be reliably detected for the fiducial parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath22 arises because the volume probed by the survey is smaller by a factor @xmath23 for non - equatorial transits , where @xmath24 is the ratio of the transit chord to the stellar diameter . for the most part we will be comparing the detectability of planets of the same size around different stars .",
    "hence , except when we are evaluating the normalization of equation ( [ eqn : ndetect ] ) for a specific example , we will ignore the last factor .",
    "the equilibrium temperature of a planet ( and thus whether or not water can exist in liquid phase on the planet surface ) is the same if @xmath25 , where the bolometric luminosity @xmath26 is to be distinguished from @xmath10 , the luminosity in the band of observation .",
    "hence , the relative sensitivity of a transit survey to habitable planets is @xmath27 here we assume that all planets have the same albedo and neglect atmospheric effects . if we compare , for example , g stars ( @xmath28 ) with middle m stars ( @xmath4 ) , the ratios of the various factors are @xmath29 .",
    "note that if we were comparing detectability at the _ same semi - major axis _ rather than the _ same habitability _ , the last factor would not have entered , and the ratio would have been 0.05 .",
    "hence , while the sensitivity to planets in general is completely dominated by g stars , the sensitivity to habitable planets is completely dominated by m stars .",
    "that is , the lower luminosities ( and so smaller semi - major axes ) combined with the smaller radii and greater numerical density of m stars more than compensate for the reduced photon counts .    in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we show the sensitivity to habitable `` earths '' and to earths all at the same semi - major axis ( taken to be 1 au ) .",
    "that is , the histograms show the total number of planets @xmath30 that will be detected as a function of @xmath31 assuming that each star in the field has one earth - size planet in the habitable zone or , respectively , one such planet at 1 au .",
    "( the two histograms cross at @xmath28 because the habitable zone is then at 1 au ) .",
    "the absolute normalization of this plot is set according to the characteristics of the _ kepler _ mission ( @xmath32 at @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , mission - total s / n=8 required for detection ) , but the form of the histogram would be the same for any photon - limited survey .",
    "the normalization for any other planet size should be multiplied by a factor @xmath36 , and the normalization for any other fixed semi - major axis should be multiplied by @xmath37 ( see eq .  [ [ eqn : ndetect ] ] ) .",
    "the figure is constructed assuming that detection is in @xmath0 band .",
    "the effect of substituting other bands is approximately to change the slope of the histogram .",
    "for example , since the slope of the main sequence is @xmath38 @xcite , substitution of @xmath1 band would lead to an increase of slope @xmath39 .",
    "that is , middle m stars would gain relative to g stars by an additional factor of @xmath40 .    to compute these histograms , we follow the procedure of @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the color - magnitude diagram is that while the main sequence is fairly narrow for @xmath41 , it broadens for brighter stars ( due to faster stellar evolution ) , so that a star of a given @xmath31 can have a large range of colors .",
    "thus , for the well - defined lower main sequence , @xmath41 , we consider the luminosity function @xcite in 1 mag bins , and evaluate the stellar radius at the center of each bin using the linear color - magnitude relation of @xcite , the color / surface - brightness relation of @xcite , and the @xmath42 color - color relations from @xcite .    on the other hand , for the upper main sequence @xmath43",
    "we evaluate the histograms directly using the hipparcos catalog @xcite .",
    "for example , the luminosity function for @xmath44 is computed by summing @xmath45^{-1}$ ] over all stars within the hipparcos completeness limit , @xmath46 , having @xmath47 , and lying within 50 pc .",
    "the distance @xmath48 is the minimum of 50 pc and the distance at which the star would have @xmath49 .",
    "then , the constant - semi - major - axis histogram is computed by summing ( and appropriately normalizing ) @xmath50^{-1}$ ] , while the habitable - zone histogram is found by summing @xmath51^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the stellar radii are determined from hipparcos / tycho @xmath52 photometry and the color / surface - brightness relation of @xcite , ultimately derived from @xcite .",
    "we evaluate @xmath26 using bolometric corrections as a function of @xmath53 color derived from @xcite and @xcite at the bright end and @xcite at the faint end .",
    "to achieve the sensitivities calculated in ",
    "[ sec : sensitivity ] , one must analyze the light curves of all the stars being probed .",
    "this statement would appear so obvious as not to be worth mentioning .",
    "however , as we now show , dim stars are being probed at substantially fainter apparent magnitudes than are their more luminous cousins . hence , to avoid losing most of the sensitivity of a transit experiment one must set different magnitude limits for stars of different @xmath31",
    "let @xmath54 be the apparent magnitude at which the survey achieves the minimum acceptable signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for a planet of radius @xmath12 and semi - major axis @xmath13 circling an @xmath28 star .",
    "consider an identical planet circling an @xmath4 star in the same orbit and at the same apparent magnitude .",
    "since the star s radius is a factor 4 smaller , the s / n will be a factor @xmath55 times larger .",
    "the first factor comes from the fact that the planet occults a larger fraction of the stellar surface , the second from the reduced total time spent in transit ( `` duty cycle '' ) due to the smaller radius .",
    "now , the bolometric luminosity of the dimmer star is down by a factor 80 , so to keep in the habitable zone , the planet must be moved closer by a factor @xmath56 .",
    "this increases the transit duty cycle by the same factor and so increases the s / n by @xmath57 . combining these two effects with the usual dependence of s /",
    "n on flux implies s / n @xmath58 .",
    "hence , to maintain the same s / n , one must increase the magnitude limit by , @xmath59 for the example just given , @xmath60 , i.e. , a factor 570 in flux .",
    "note that @xmath61 does not depend on the passband of observation .",
    "the dashed curve in figure [ fig : one ] shows the difference in the maximum distance modulus relative to the sun at which a habitable planet ( of given radius ) can be detected .",
    "specifically , @xmath62 . for @xmath0 band observations , this offset is roughly constant over 10 magnitudes .",
    "that is , the limiting magnitude required to achieve the sensitivities shown by the bold histogram increases approximately in lock step with @xmath31 .",
    "this behavior can have major consequences for the design of transit experiments .",
    "photon - limited observations are not routinely achievable over very large dynamic ranges",
    ". a number of effects can intervene at fainter magnitudes .",
    "first , once the stars fall below the sky , the number of detected systems no longer falls as @xmath63 ( see eq .  [ [ eqn : ndetect ] ] ) but as @xmath64 .",
    "that is , once the sky is reached , detections would fall off by a factor @xmath65 per magnitude relative to the bold histogram in figure [ fig : one ] .",
    "second , if the exposure times are set so as not to saturate the brightest target stars ( say 2 mag brighter than the mag limit appropriate for @xmath28 ) , then the flux levels will be a factor @xmath66 times lower at the mag limit appropriate for @xmath4 . for many observing setups , this would render the flux levels comparable to the read noise .",
    "third , a field that is very uncrowded at one magnitude may well be extremely crowded 7 magnitudes fainter , and this may interfere with doing photon - limited photometry . hence , it is unlikely that all of the potential shown in figure [ fig : one ] can be achieved in any given practical experiment . nevertheless , this potential is so great that it is worth thinking about how to achieve as much as possible .",
    "we illustrate the type of trade - offs involved by considering the _ kepler _ mission , the only transit experiment proposed to date whose primary target is planets in the habitable zone .",
    "the _ kepler _ design calls for recording only stars @xmath67 , presumably in order to minimize data transmission .",
    "the mag limit required to detect earth - like planets around sun - like stars at s / n=8 is @xmath68 .",
    "hence , from the dashed curve in figure [ fig : one ] , the required mag limit at @xmath2 is @xmath69 , i.e. , already somewhat fainter than the @xmath70 limit adopted by _",
    "kepler_. the volume probed , and hence the detections , fall relative to the bold histogram by a factor @xmath71 for each magnitude beyond @xmath2 . see figure [ fig : two ] .",
    "hence , assuming that every star has one planet in the habitable zone , only a total of 20 will be detected .    keeping the photometry information for stars to @xmath72 ,",
    "for example , should increase the number of habitable - planet detections by almost a factor 3 , while keeping stars with @xmath73 would increase this number by a factor 9 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : two ] .",
    "of course , there are many obstacles to keeping information on stars this faint .",
    "for example , there would be an enormous number of giant stars contaminating such a deep sample .",
    "in fact , however , distinguishing the later - type dwarfs from the much more numerous giants of similar colors is straightforward .",
    "as shown by @xcite , they can easily be identified on a reduced proper motion ( rpm ) diagram constructed using data from usno - a @xcite and 2mass @xcite . with usno - b @xcite it should be possible to extend coverage to fainter magnitudes and to achieve higher precision as well .",
    "the total number of such stars @xmath74 is only @xmath75 , far fewer than the @xmath76 giants in the field that could be eliminated using the same rpm diagram @xcite .",
    "a more difficult problem is crowding .",
    "the _ kepler _ point spread function ( psf ) is deliberately defocused to @xmath77 , meaning that the crowding limit is about @xmath78 .",
    "at the adopted _ kepler _ sight line , @xmath79 , this limit is reached at @xmath80 ( as determined by a query of the usno - a catalog ) . if _",
    "kepler _ were redirected to @xmath81 , the density of stars down to @xmath82 would be @xmath83 , approximately 3 times lower .",
    "hence , recovery of faint stars would be much easier . presumably , _",
    "kepler _ has chosen to look right in the galactic plane because of the higher overall star density . however , since the stars useful for transits mostly lie within 500 pc , a field at @xmath84 would lie only 130 pc above the plane , where the density of such target stars is only slightly lower than at the plane .",
    "hence , the crowding problem could be substantially ameliorated at small cost .",
    "the last problem is sky . at high ecliptic latitude ,",
    "the sky in space is @xmath85 , or @xmath86 in a @xmath77 psf .",
    "hence , _ kepler _ completeness appears to be fundamentally limited to stars @xmath87 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : two ] , detections from stars at @xmath88 would be highly suppressed . only contracting the psf ( which has been deliberately defocused to improve the photometry )",
    "could overcome this difficulty .",
    "( note that at @xmath86 , crowding would not be a serious problem even for the current galactic - plane line of sight . )      finally , we note that the results reported here are a strong function of planet size . as remarked in ",
    "[ sec : sensitivity ] , the absolute normalizations in figure [ fig : one ] scale as @xmath89 . by an argument similar to the one given in ",
    "[ sec : maglims ] , @xmath90 .",
    "for example , for @xmath91 , the normalizations in figure [ fig : one ] would be reduced by a factor 16 , while the required @xmath92 at each @xmath31 would be brighter by 2 mag .",
    "hence , in _ kepler _ s current configuration , it would retain full sensitivity to @xmath93 stars , and so would be able to detect @xmath94 planets ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] ) , while if its coverage were extended 3 mag to @xmath95 , it could probe the m - dwarf peak , and so detect @xmath96 planets .",
