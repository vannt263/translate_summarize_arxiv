    "the ability to create and detect single - cycle pulses of coherent terahertz ( thz ) radiation has enabled diverse studies in condensed matter physics .",
    "recent examples include a study of how surface plasmon polaritons propagate on semiconductor gratings,@xcite determining the low - energy vibrational modes of oligomers,@xcite and measuring the time - dependent intersubband absorption in semiconductor quantum wells.@xcite such studies have become possible using high power , broadband thz radiation emitters based on the ultrafast separation of photoexcited carriers in a photoconductive switch.@xcite in this communication we investigate how the choice of semiconductor alters thz emission , by employing a carrier dynamics simulation to model ingaas and inp photoconductive switches .",
    "the use of a low - bandgap semiconductor ( such as @xmath1 with an alloy fraction x  @xmath2 ) would enable cheaper , more stable , turnkey thz spectroscopy setups based on erbium fibre ( er : fibre ) lasers , which can produce pulses as short as @xmath3fs at a central wavelength @xmath4m.@xcite combining a compact system of this type with communications wavelength optical fibres would enable thz pulses to be generated and detected in small , extreme , or otherwise inaccessible environments ( e.g.  in an endoscope or in the cavity of a pulsed magnet ) .",
    "while gaas - based photoconductive switch technology is well developed@xcite , there are fewer inp and ingaas - based thz emitters described in the literature,@xcite .",
    "@xcite reported thz emission up to 3thz from a low - temperature ( lt ) grown @xmath5 photoconductive switch , using a nd glass laser .",
    "additionally , suzuki and tonouchi@xcite have measured the thz emission from photoconductive switches made from @xmath6 implanted by 340kev , @xmath7@xmath8 fe ions .",
    "they used an er : fibre laser with central wavelength 1.56@xmath9 m and pulse duration 300fs , and measured thz power up to @xmath10thz .",
    "finally , mangeney _ et .",
    "@xcite performed a similar experiment on @xmath6 implanted by au@xmath11 ions , with a carrier lifetime of 0.9ps .    in order to investigate suitable semiconductors for photoconductive switch thz",
    "emitters it is beneficial to adopt a modelling approach .",
    "the effect of altering one parameter ( or more ) of the semiconductor material or laser can be investigated rapidly , and an optimum combination sought . while analytical models of thz emission are relatively straightforward to interpret , they often require phenomological assumptions ( e.g.  about carrier mobilities ) . in this paper",
    "we therefore employ a three - dimensional semi - classical carrier dynamics simulation to model @xmath1 and inp photoconductive switch thz emitters .",
    "the carrier dynamics model used herein is an extension of one used previously to model the thz emission from inas and gaas surfaces under a magnetic field,@xcite ion - implanted gaas surfaces@xcite and gaas photoconductive switches.@xcite a set of @xmath12 pseudoparticles comprising extrinsic and photogenerated carriers and fixed ions are used to simulate the semiconductor . at each 5fs step in time",
    "the model numerically finds the three - dimensional potential due to the charge density , subject to the appropriate boundary conditions for the surface and schottky photoconductive switch contacts .",
    "carrier - carrier , carrier - phonon and carrier - impurity scattering mechanisms are included.@xcite the simulated particles are within a box of size @xmath13m@xmath14 , subdivided into a grid of @xmath15 .",
    "the contacts of the photoconductive switch are at @xmath16 m and @xmath17 m .",
    "a constant bias voltage of 5v between electrodes was used throughout this work , which corresponds to typical experimental field strengths .",
    "the simulation starts at a time @xmath18ps , to allow the extrinsic carriers to equilibrate before the arrival of the incident pulse , which has peak intensity at time @xmath19ps , and is centred at @xmath20 .",
    "although the simulation assumes a parabolic band structure for simplicity , in the modelling of thz emission from narrow band - gap semiconductor surfaces the inclusion of the l - valley was found to create a more realistic distribution of carrier energies.@xcite in photoconductive switches the average carrier energy is greater than for surface emitters , and intervalley ( e.g.@xmath21 ) scattering by absorption or emission of an optical phonon becomes more significant .",
    "further , in the range @xmath22 the x - valley energy gap of @xmath1 falls below that of the l - valley .",
    "the simulation was therefore extended to include the @xmath23 valley in addition to the @xmath0 and @xmath24 valleys .",
    "values of semiconductor parameters for @xmath1 at a particular alloy fraction @xmath25 were generated automatically within the simulation from the bowing parameter@xcite .",
    "when no bowing parameter was found in the literature , linear interpolation between inas and gaas was used . the two - mode to phonon energies for ingaas of ref .",
    "@xcite were employed . for consistency",
    "the intervalley deformation potentials were taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , the only reference found with values for gaas , inas and inp .",
    "an inspection of the properties of ingaas suggests potential advantages and disadvantages as a thz emitter when compared with gaas .",
    "firstly , a lower @xmath0-valley effective mass should result in a higher electron mobility , and greater thz power .",
    "secondly , the intervalley deformation potential d@xmath26 is greater for inas than gaas@xcite , resulting in a larger intervalley scattering rate . when electrons scatter to the l or x valley they lose kinetic energy , contributing to the deceleration of carriers that produces the negative peak in @xmath27 .",
    "the lower absorption coefficient of ingaas at @xmath28 m compared with gaas at 800 nm ( @xmath29m@xmath30 ) is a disadvantage , because a lower @xmath31 results in a lower bandwidth for defect - laden semiconductors , owing to the photogeneration of fewer carriers within the damaged depth .",
    "in addition , with a smaller @xmath31 the emitted thz radiation will on average travel further through the semiconductor ( when the reflection geometry@xcite is used ) , and will be more significantly affected by absorption and dispersion .    finally , since @xmath1 exhibits two - mode to phonon behaviour@xcite the thz emission spectra should exhibit strong absorption peaks near the to phonon energies ( e.g.  for x=0.47 the two modes have frequencies of 6.8 and 7.6thz ) . this will limit the spectroscopic use of @xmath1 photoconductive emitters in the frequency range near and between the to phonon modes of inas and gaas ( 6.4 and 8.1thz ) .",
    "the following section describes how the two - mode to phonon - polariton dispersion of ingaas was included in the simulation .",
    "the radiated thz electric field @xmath27  was calculated in the far - field approximation from the simulated current density @xmath32 using the relation @xmath33,@xcite where the dielectric function @xmath34 was modelled using the well - known drude - lorentz formula for to phonon - polaritons,@xcite which for two to phonon modes is given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 are the low and high frequency dielectric constants at alloy fraction x. the angular frequency of the gaas - like ( inas - like ) to phonon is @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) . the damping rate was assumed to be @xmath40ps@xmath30 for both inas - like and gaas - like to phonon modes.@xcite in order to estimate the thickness of semiconductor through which the emitted thz must propagate we calculated the maximum thz electric field from each ` slice ' parallel to the surface .",
    "taking the mean of this distribution results in a weighted propagation thickness of @xmath41 m . assuming that the emitted thz radiation is collected in the reflection geometry ( to minimise absorption and dispersion in the semiconductor material@xcite ) @xmath42 m is a reasonable estimate of the propagation distance of thz radiation in an ingaas photoconductive switch .",
    "we therefore propagate @xmath27  through this thickness of semiconductor , and into free space , resulting in a characteristic reduction in spectral amplitude of emitted thz radiation close to a to phonon mode , and an enhancement just above the frequency of an lo phonon ( as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : comparison]-[fig : varegap ] ) .",
    "the simulation uses incident pulse parameters characteristic of current ultra - short mode - locked lasers ( i.e.  a gaussian spatial and temporal shape , and a transform - limited gaussian energy distribution ) . for the case of a 10fs ti : sapphire laser ( with central wavelength @xmath43 nm , @xmath44 nm , typical beam power @xmath45mw and a repetition rate @xmath46mhz ) we use a simulation power of @xmath47w and a gaussian spot of standard deviation @xmath48 m in order to obtain the same photon flux as experimentally achievable . while amplified er : fibre lasers have been demonstrated with pulse durations of 65fs ( @xmath49 nm , @xmath50 nm , @xmath51mw , @xmath52mhz),@xcite sub-30fs pulses widely tunable over the wavelength range 1130 to 1950 nm may be generated by coupling such er : fibre laser light into a highly non - linear fibre.@xcite for excitation around @xmath28 m we use @xmath53w and @xmath48 m , chosen to give the same photon flux as for the ti : sapphire , so that a comparison between @xmath6 switches excited by @xmath28 m radiation , and gaas excited by 800 nm can be made in section [ sec : results ] . with the aim of providing a quick reference to the laser parameters used we refer below to the 10fs , @xmath43 nm ti : sapphire just described as laser a , and the 65fs @xmath4 m er : fibre as laser b.",
    "in fig .  [ fig : comparison ] we compare the simulated @xmath27  for inp and gaas photoconductive switches excited by 10fs pulses from laser a with that obtained for inas excited by 65fs pulses from laser b. these parameters were chosen to enable a comparison between thz systems based on current state - of - the - art lasers . in order to enable a comparison between the results presented we normalize @xmath27  in the time and frequency domains to the peak simulated values for a gaas photoconductive switch excited by laser a ( with carrier trapping time @xmath54",
    "@xmath55ps ) , denoted @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "similarly the emitted thz power ( defined as the square of @xmath58 integrated over all times ) is normalized to @xmath59 , the power for the gaas emitter .",
    "the peak value of @xmath27  for inas is larger than for gaas , despite the er : fibre laser s power being lower than that of the ti : sapphire ( the photon flux is the same for both lasers ) .",
    "this can be attributed in part to a higher fraction of incident photons having above - bandgap energy . as the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] indicates , almost @xmath60 of photons from laser b have energy greater than @xmath61ev , while the above - bandgap fraction for laser a is smaller ( @xmath6280% ) . the fact that inas has a lower effective mass in the @xmath0-valley than gaas also contributes to the power increase .",
    "qualitatively , a smaller effective mass produces a larger mobility @xmath63 , which should result in a larger transient current and therefore power .",
    "however , this argument neglects changes in the carrier scattering time @xmath64 , and we return to this point in section [ sec : constdelta ] .",
    "turning now to @xmath27  for inp , we observe a slightly greater peak time - domain and spectral amplitude than for gaas , despite the larger @xmath65 ( lower mobility ) of inp .",

    "[ fig : varxvart](a ) shows , the emitted thz power increases towards x=0 , as found in section [ sec : constlam ] . by extracting the total carrier momentum scattering time @xmath64 from the simulation ( summed over all scattering mechanisms , averaged over all electrons in the @xmath0 valley , and taken at @xmath78ps ) we estimate the high - field electron mobility @xmath96 .",
    "the relative increase in @xmath97 towards inas is comparable with the enhancement in experimental low - field mobility ( fig .",
    "[ fig : varxvart](b ) ) , and results from a decrease in both the carrier - carrier and carrier - lo phonon scattering rates .    shortly after the peak intensity of the incident pulse the electric field applied across a photoconductive switch",
    "is completely screened by the build - up of the thz - emitting dipole .",
    "this occurs in a characteristic screening time @xmath98fs for a semi - insulating gaas photoconductive switch.@xcite by calculating the electric field at the incident spot position ( @xmath99 m ) as a function of time , it is possible to extract the screening time @xmath100 , defined as the time at which the electric field becomes zero .",
    "figure [ fig : varxvart](b ) indicates that @xmath100 increases as the ga alloy fraction @xmath83 , as a result of the lower electron mobility .",
    "it should be noted that a shorter screening time does not necessarily mean a reduction in the thz power emitted : a higher mobility can produce both a lower @xmath100 and a greater power .",
    "this simulation set was repeated for incident pulse durations of 10fs and 100fs . in the 10fs case the total power emitted ( fig .",
    "[ fig : varxvart](a ) ) is smaller than for 65fs across the entire range of x , as fewer carriers are photoexcited . however , for 100fs the power is again lower than the 65fs case , because when the later carriers are photoexcited the electric field is already partly screened .",
    "how the thz power and bandwidth alter as a function of incident pulse duration was discussed for semi - insulating gaas in ref .",
    "the fwhm of the 100fs spectra are lower than those of the 10fs and 65fs simulations , owing to the slow rise in @xmath27 .",
    "somewhat counterintuitively , the 10fs spectra do not have greater fwhm than the 65fs over the whole range of x. this can be explained by noting that the fwhm measures the width of the spectrum , and not the high - frequency spectral tail .",
    "thus while greater spectral amplitude is obtained at high frequencies for 10fs excitation ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison](b ) ) , the amplitude at low - frequency ( which dominates the fwhm ) is larger at incident pulse durations of 65fs .",

    "in summary , we have simulated the terahertz emission from @xmath1 photoconductive switches over the entire alloy fraction range @xmath102 .",
    "two methods for increasing the thz power from photoconductive switches were identified .",
    "firstly , a larger electron mobility resulted in a larger thz power as the ga alloy fraction was decreased .",
    "this suggests that semiconductors with high mobility / low effective mass may be used to improve thz power , for example inas ( @xmath103 ) or insb ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "experimentally , a high resistivity or semi - insulating inas may be required to produce a photoconductive switch with a low dark current .",
    "secondly , increased thz power can be obtained by judicious choice of incident pulse energy , so that the majority of photons are absorbed .",
    "the spectra calculated from the simulation indicate that inas photoconductive switches have greater power than gaas over the frequency range @xmath105thz . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the initial rise in @xmath27  ( dominated by the incident pulse duration ) governs the amplitude .",
