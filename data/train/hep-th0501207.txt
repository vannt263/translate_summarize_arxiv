    "we saw from equation ( [ finalbog ] ) that we are left with three such terms : the wall charge , the vortex charge and the monopole charge .",
    "the binding energy is associated with the latter ; more specifically , and rather curiously , it is one half of a negative mass bps monopole .",

    "the latter has already been accounted for in the topological charge @xmath258 , but this is overcounting ; the binding energy remedies this . to see that the parametric scaling agrees , note that the vortex tube stretched across the inner layer would have energy e_vortex~t_vortex~ while the actual energy from the flux can be readily estimated .",
    "if , for some value of @xmath54 , the flux spreads over an area @xmath259 then the magnetic field scales as @xmath260 . the effective tension ( energy density per unit @xmath54 length ) of the flux tube in that region is _",

    "the advantage of working with the transpose matrices is that our two equations may now be combined into a single matrix equation , (          ) .",
    "the operator @xmath337 acts by adjoint action , while the operator @xmath338 acts by right multiplication ( as indeed it must by simply examining the indices ) .",
    "the operator @xmath335 acts on a vector space of @xmath339 matrices @xmath340 where the inner product between @xmath340 and @xmath341 is defined by ( , ) & & tr ( , ) + ( , ) + & & dx^3 ( tr + tr ) .",
    "[ eq : innerprod ] therefore the adjoint operator @xmath342 is given by ^= (            ) |^2 & = & |_3+[,]+h^|^2 + |_3+^-m+h|^2 [ nozero ] + & = & |_3+[,]|^2 + |h^|^2 + |_3+^-m|^2 + |h|^2 + where the cross terms are given by , & = & ( _ 3 + [ , ] , h^ ) + ( h^ , _ 3 + [ , ] ) + & & + ( _ 3+^-m , h ) + ( h , _ 3+^-",

    "the equations in the parentheses are simply the transpose of the domain wall equations ( [ vort2 ] ) and therefore vanish on the background soliton .",
    "since these cross - terms vanish , the action of @xmath342 can be written as a sum of total squares as in ( [ nozero ] ) , which includes the term @xmath344 and , for @xmath345 of maximal rank ensures that any zero mode of @xmath342 must have @xmath346 . to show that the zero mode also requires @xmath347",
    "is only slightly more involved .",
    "the term @xmath348 can vanish for @xmath349 , where @xmath350 is a hermitian @xmath325 matrix . with this ansatz",
    ", one can show that the matrix @xmath350 must solve something akin to a lax equation : @xmath351 $ ] which , imposing the boundary condition @xmath352 at @xmath210 requires @xmath352 .",
    "we conclude @xmath342 has no zero modes .",
    "the number of complex zero modes of @xmath335 is defined by @xmath353 where the regulated index @xmath354 is ( m^2 ) = tr ( ) -tr ( ) clearly @xmath355 counts the number of zero modes of @xmath335 minus the number of zero modes of @xmath342 .",
    "but since , as we have seen , the latter operator has vanishing kernel , @xmath355 counts the number of parameters of the domain wall equations as required . using standard callias index theorem techniques ( see for example @xcite for application to monopoles , and @xcite for application to domain walls ) , we can rewrite the index as ( m^2)=-12^x=+_x=- where the current @xmath356 is defined as j(x , m^2 ) = -trx |   + ^  |xhere @xmath357 denotes the trace over colour and flavour indices , as well as over the @xmath358 entries of @xmath335 .",
    "we first need to compute @xmath359 and @xmath360 . in general these",
    "are somewhat complicated matrices , but our task is made a little simpler by the fact that we only need to evaluate them in a vacuum state .",
    "this means that we may set @xmath361 or , in our current notation , @xmath362 .",
    "we can also insist that derivatives of the background field vanish : @xmath363 .",
    "finally , from the f - term condition , we also have that @xmath364 . with these constraints ,",
    "the two matrix products may be easily evaluated to give .^|_vacuo = .^|_vacuo= (      ) .",
    "[ dddagger]let s firstly examine the current with the expressions we derived above , neglecting the trace over flavour indices and the integral over space .",
    "we have & & tr_2tr_n_c = tr_n_c where , for simplicity of notation , we have defined the operators @xmath365 and @xmath366 arising in the expression ( [ dddagger ] ) for @xmath360 and @xmath359 .^|_vacuo=.^|_vacuo =(      ) we see that the @xmath367 derivatives in the numerator explicitly cancel , while the adjoint action @xmath368 vanishes upon taking the trace over the gauge group . recalling that @xmath369 in vacuo ,",
    "we re left with , tr_2tr_n_c=-2tr_n_cnow we can evaluate the differential operator @xmath370 in momentum space to obtain j(x , m^2)=tr_n_ctr_n_f which , in turn , yields an expression for the number of zero modes : = i_-i_-= -_n_ctr_n_f^+_- where @xmath371 denotes the expression in the bracket evaluated at @xmath372 .",
    "we are nearly there .",
    "all that is left is some algebraic manipulation .",
    "recall from ( [ vacuum ] ) that as @xmath234 , we have @xmath373 and @xmath374 .",
    "the combination of @xmath14 that appears in the expression for the index is hh^=q^t(q^t)^=v^2i _ where the @xmath325 matrix @xmath375 has only non - zero diagonal entries which are given by @xmath376 if @xmath157 .",
    "we therefore have -2i_+&=&tr_n_ctr_n_f .",
    "|_x=+ + & = & _ a=1^n_c_i=1^n_f + & = & _ a=1^n_c(_isign(m_(a)-m_i)+_i ) + & = & _ a=1^n_c_isign(m_(a)-m_i)+_a , b=1^n_c + & = & _ a=1^n_c_isign(m_(a)-m_i ) where in the final equality , we have noticed that the term involving sums over @xmath150 and @xmath377 vanishes by anti - symmetry .",
    "in fact , this same trick also allows us to rewrite the final term as a sum over all @xmath87 , rather than the complement of @xmath30 .",
    "so , including the contribution from @xmath378 as well , we finally get the following expressions for the index = -12_i=1^n_f_a=1^n_c(sign(m_(a)-m_i)- sign(m_(a)-m_i ) ) = -_a=1^n_c((a)-(a ) ) [ index]finally , we want to massage this expression to write it in terms of the root vector @xmath77 .",
    "we ll rewrite the topological charge as @xmath379 where @xmath380 and @xmath381 .",
    "since the vacuum set @xmath30 consists of @xmath382 copies of @xmath383 and @xmath384 copies of @xmath385 , we can write @xmath386 which , defining @xmath387 , allows us to rewrite the index as & = & -_k=1^n_fkp_k = -_k=1^n_fk(n_k - n_k-1 ) = _ a=1^n_f-1n_a as advertised .",
