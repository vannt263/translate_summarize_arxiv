    "interacting quantum many - particle systems in the presence of disorder are of great interest not only in condensed matter physics @xcite but recently also in the field of cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "in particular , ultracold gases have quickly developed into a fascinating new laboratory for the study of quantum many - body physics .",
    "a major advantage of cold atoms in optical lattices is the high degree of controlability of experimental parameters such as the interaction and the disorder strength , which allows for a detailed comparison between experiment and theory . indeed",
    ", advanced techniques developed for experiments with ultracold gases in optical lattices facilitate the realization and explicit study of model situations which are not accessible in solid state physics .",
    "for example , it was recently demonstrated that it is possible to prepare optical lattices with a _ spin - dependent _ hopping of the quantum particles @xcite .",
    "corresponding theoretical models had already been proposed earlier @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the thermodynamic properties of interacting spin-1/2 lattice fermions with a repulsive , local interaction in the presence of a spin - dependent random potential .",
    "in particular , we will compute the spin - dependent densities , the magnetization , the magnetic susceptibility , the compressibility , and the spin - dependent densities of states . when the interaction is taken to be attractive the model has a superfluid phase , which was recently investigated by scalettar and collaborators @xcite .",
    "it may be realized experimentally in the following way : in an off - resonant electric field atoms experience stark shift of their ground state energies , which is proportional to the light intensity .",
    "the optical lattice is formed by superimposing laser waves propagating in different spatial directions .",
    "this effectively leads to a periodic dependence of the electric field intensity and thereby to a periodic potential .",
    "disorder can be introduced by focusing a light beam on the optical lattice , which is scattered from a diffusive plate .",
    "such an effective random potential ( speckle - type disorder ) is characterized by a very short correlation length and a pronounced statistical independence @xcite . using laser beams with different polarization it is possible to generate a random potential which acts differently on particles with different spin - orientation in the ground state @xcite .",
    "the spin - dependent speckle disorder affects the local one - particle energies , hopping amplitudes , and interparticle interaction potentials .",
    "since ultracold atoms in optical lattices can be experimentally prepared in quite different ways , two model situations are of particular interest : ( a ) the total number of fermions is conserved , and ( b ) the number of fermions with different spin projection is individually conserved ; the latter case is refered to as a `` spin - imbalanced '' system .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed case ( b ) for an attractive interaction between the fermions , which leads to a pairing instability .",
    "employing bogoliubov - de gennes mean - field theory they found that spin - dependent disorder leads to a suppression of the pairing state .    in the first part of this paper",
    "we investigate the case when the total number of fermions is conserved ( i.e. , when the two spin populations have a common chemical potential ) for a repulsive local interaction .",
    "in particular , we will focus on fillings off half - filling , since in this case spin - dependent disorder induces a finite magnetization through the broadening of the spin sub - band on which the disorder acts . at the same time antiferromagnetism and characteristic correlation features which occur only at half - filling , such as",
    "the mott metal - insulator transition @xcite , will be absent @xcite .",
    "the spin - dependent randomness is introduced through local , random , and spin - dependent potentials .",
    "such a model is closely related to electronic models investigated in solid state physics @xcite , in particular correlated lattice electrons in random potentials ; see , for example , refs .",
    "however , in solid state systems it is not possible ( or , at least , not yet possible ) to tune and manipulate spin - dependent potentials experimentally .",
    "by contrast , as discussed above , optical lattices with ultracold atoms do offer such possibilities .",
    "in particular , the model where the total number of fermions is conserved is applicable to systems with atoms characterized by a fast dipolar relaxation , such as cr or rare elements with large magnetic dipole moments @xcite .",
    "similarly , by employing double - shot phase contrast imaging for atoms in an external parabolic potential trap it is possible to determine spin - dependent densities , the spin susceptibility , and the compressibility of particles @xcite .",
    "hence systematic studies of the disorder induced spin - asymmetric changes of the thermodynamic properties of such system are possible . in the second part of the paper we report results for spin - imbalanced systems , i.e. , when each spin population has an individual chemical potential .",
    "spin - imbalanced fermionic systems have been investigated experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite either in optical lattices or in the case of a trap without disorder .",
    "spin - dependent disorder adds a new tool to the examination of correlation effects in spin - imbalanced fermionic systems .",
    "in the following we will study interacting fermions in a random environment , modeled by the anderson - hubbard hamiltonian with local , spin - dependent disorder @xmath0 here @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the anihilation ( creation ) fermionic operator , @xmath3 is the particle number operator , @xmath4 is the hopping matrix element , @xmath5 is the local interaction , and @xmath6 is the chemical potential for particles with spin @xmath7 . in the model",
    "where the total number of fermions is conserved the chemical potentials of the two species obey @xmath8 . in the model",
    "where the numbers of fermions with different spin are individually conserved the chemical potentials @xmath9 can differ .",
    "the disorder is represented by random local potentials @xmath10 which are distributed according to a box probability density @xmath11 for @xmath12 , and zero otherwise ( `` continuous disorder '' ) . here",
    "@xmath13 is the maximal energy difference between the local energies for a given spin direction and thus provides a measure of the disorder strength .",
    "averages over the disorder are calculated by @xmath14 , whereby the study of anderson localization within the one - particle green function formalism is excluded @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note @xcite that by introducing the @xmath15-component of the magnetization operator @xmath16 and the local particle number operator @xmath17 , the anderson - hubbard hamiltonian for the model where the total number of fermions is conserved takes the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) has a natural interpretation : it describes fermionic atoms moving in a random chemical potential @xmath21 and a random zeeman magnetic field @xmath22 which are correlated , since @xmath23 when @xmath24 we arrive at the anderson - hubbard model with spin - independent disorder @xcite .",
    "we solve the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) within dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite .",
    "hence all local dynamical correlations due to the local interaction are fully taken into account .",
    "however , non - local correlations in position space are absent .",

    "@xmath47 is a measure of the disorder strength .",

    "intermediate cases can be studied in the same way .    in the model",
    "where the total number of fermions is conserved the chemical potential @xmath48 is fixed to keep the total number of fermions per site constant : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the number of lattice sites .",

    "the increase of @xmath63 is slightly stronger for larger values of the interaction @xmath5 .",
    "it should be noted that the origin of the magnetization is not due to electronic correlations , but is a pure one - particle effect , which for a symmetric dos , occurs only away from half filling ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "namely , spin - dependent disorder leads to a symmetric broadening of the spin subband on which it acts ( here the down - spins ) , whereby the number of spin - down particles _ increases _ while the number of spin - up particles _ decreases _ since the total number of particles remains constant ( that is , the two spin populations have a common chemical potential as shown in the lower part of fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this then leads to a finite magnetization .",
