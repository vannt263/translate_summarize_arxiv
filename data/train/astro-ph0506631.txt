    "since the discovery of the first lensed quasar , q0957 + 561 @xcite , approximately 80 lensed quasars have been discovered to date .",
    "gravitationally lensed quasars are now known to be an useful tool for cosmology and astrophysics , such as measurements of dark energy @xcite , direct probes of the hubble constant @xcite , and the study of lensing galaxies @xcite . in order to use lensed quasars as these cosmological and astrophysical tests , large and homogeneous samples of gravitational lenses are necessary , either to ensure good statistical precisions and to provide sufficient number of lensing systems which are suitable for measurements of time delays and/or for studies of the lensing galaxies .",
    "although several previous large and homogeneous lensed quasar surveys , e.g. , jodrell / vla astrometric survey and the cosmic lens all - sky survey @xcite and the _ hubble space telescope _ snapshot survey @xcite , are of considerable value , discoveries of more lensed quasars in larger surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will greatly improve the accuracy of these cosmological and astrophysical tests .",
    "the final number of spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the sdss is expected to be about @xmath4 , thus , if we assume the lensing rate of 0.1% @xcite , the expected number of gravitationally lensed quasars in the sdss will be approximately @xmath5 ; the sdss could double the number of lensed quasars .",
    "indeed , several newly discovered lensed quasars in the sdss data have already been reported @xcite .    in this paper , we report the discovery of another lensed quasar , sdss  j024634.11@xmath0082536.3 ( sdss  j0246@xmath00825 ) .",
    "this object was selected as a lensed quasar candidate ( an `` extended '' quasar ) from about 50,000 sdss quasars using the algorithm described in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . since the sdss imaging and spectroscopic data of sdss  j0246@xmath00825 are unresolved , we conducted additional observations using the w. m. keck observatory s keck ii telescope , the magellan consortium s walter baade 6.5-m telescope ( wb6.5 m ) , and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "these observations demonstrate that sdss  j0246@xmath00825 is a two - image lens ( the image separation is 104 ) of a source quasar at @xmath2 , and that the likely lensing galaxy has been detected .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : obs ] describes both the photometric and spectroscopic follow - up observations . in  [ sec : model ] , we show mass modeling of this lensing system .",
    "finally , we present a summary and give a conclusion in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we assume a lambda - dominate cosmology ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ; matter density @xmath6 , cosmological constant @xmath7 , and the hubble constant @xmath8 km sec@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 ) , and we use ab magnitude system @xcite throughout the paper .",
    "the sdss is a project to conduct in parallel a photometric survey @xcite and a spectroscopic survey @xcite of 10,000 square degrees of the sky centered approximately on the north galactic pole , using dedicated wide - field ( @xmath10 field of view ) 2.5-m telescope at apache point observatory in new mexico , usa . the astrometric positions are accurate to better than about @xmath11 rms per coordinate @xcite and the photometric errors are less than about 0.03 magnitude @xcite .",
    "photometric observations are conducted using five optical broad bands @xcite .",
    "after automated data processing by the photometric pipeline @xcite , quasar , galaxy and luminous red galaxy candidates are selected by the target selection pipelines @xcite .",
    "spectra of these candidates are obtained with a multi - fiber spectrograph covering 3800 to 9200 ( resolution r @xmath12 1800 ) .",
    "the @xmath13 sdss images of sdss  j0246@xmath00825 ( sky and bias subtracted and flat - field corrected ) are shown in figure  [ fig : sdss ] .",
    "two stellar components are marginally - resolved / unresolved in the sdss images ; total magnitudes ( in @xmath1220 aperture radius ) of the two quasar components and the lensing galaxy ( and an unknown extended object , see below ) are 18.21@xmath140.02 , 17.99@xmath140.01 , 17.95@xmath140.01 , 17.60@xmath140.01 , and 17.58@xmath140.02 in @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "these errors in the magnitudes are statistical errors .",
    "we show the field image ( sdss @xmath18 band image ) around sdss  j0246@xmath00825 , including a nearby star ( star s ) which is seen in both the wb6.5 m images and the sdss images , in figure [ fig : field ] .",
    "we use star s to estimate a point spread function ( psf ) and to calibrate magnitudes .",
    "sdss  j0246@xmath00825 was targeted as a quasar candidate by the target selection pipelines , and the spectrum was taken by the sdss spectrograph .",
    "the spectrum data are also unresolved due to the spatial resolution of the sdss spectroscopy , but it clearly shows the quasar emission lines at @xmath20 .",
    "high - resolution images of sdss  j0246@xmath00825 in the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 filters were obtained with the magellan instant camera ( magic , a 2048@xmath212048 ccd camera ; pixel scale is 0069 ) on the wb6.5 m telescope , on 2002 february 13 .",
    "the seeing ( fwhm ) was @xmath220506 , and the exposure time was 120 sec in each band .",
    "the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 magic images of sdss  j0246@xmath00825 are shown in figure [ fig : mag_all ] .",
    "two stellar components are clearly seen in all these images ; we named the two stellar components a and b , with a being the brighter component .",
    "the flux ratios between components b and a ( estimated by the single gaussian fit ) are 0.32 , 0.31 , 0.33 , and 0.34 in @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the psfs derived from star s were subtracted from the original @xmath18 band magic image . the peak flux and",
    "the center coordinates of components a and b in the magic @xmath18 band image were calculated by the single gaussian fit .",
    "the results agree with those obtained by the imexamine task in iraf . the @xmath18 band psf - subtracted image is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : mag_i ] .",
    "although it is not obvious in figure [ fig : mag_i ] , we find a faint , extended object ( @xmath22 21.8 mag in 05 aperture radius ) between the two stellar components after the psf subtraction . for further discussion of this object , see the keck results in  [ sec : keck ] and/or the _ hst _ results in  [ sec : hst ] . the angular separation ( in the @xmath18 band image ) between components a and b is 1042@xmath140003 .",
    "the @xmath23 band psf magnitudes of components a and b and the @xmath18 band aperture magnitude of the extended objects between components a and b ( component g , see below ) are summarized in table [ table : pos ] . here",
    "we used star s ( see figure [ fig : field ] ) as a photometric star .",
    "we conducted a near - infrared imaging observation of sdss  j0246@xmath00825 using the keck i telescope , on 2002 august 21 .",
    "although the night was not photometric , we obtained @xmath24 band data with the near infrared camera ( nirc ; * ? ? ?",
    "the seeing ( fwhm ) was variable , averaging about 04 , and the total exposure time was 900 sec .",
    "the deconvolved @xmath24 band image is shown in figure [ fig : keck - k ] ; the deconvolution was done using the method which is described in @xcite .",
    "the pixel size is half that of the raw image , 0075 . in figure",
    "[ fig : keck - k ] , we can clearly see an extended object ( named component g ) at the same position of the extended object found in the psf - subtracted magic @xmath18 band image ( we can see component g more clearly in the psf - subtracted images , the inset of figure [ fig : keck - k ] ) .",
    "this object is probably the lensing galaxy of this lensed quasar system ; this hypothesis is further supported by the spectroscopic observation of the two stellar components using the keck telescope and the high - resolution imaging observation using the _ hst _ ( see  [ sec : hst ] ) . the flux ratio between components b and a is 0.29 in the @xmath24 band image ; this is consistent with the mean flux ratio of the optical bands .",
    "spectra of the two components of sdss  j0246@xmath00825 were acquired using the keck ii telescope on 2002 december 4 .",
    "we conducted a spectroscopic follow - up observation using the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the mit - ll 2048@xmath214096 ccd camera .",
    "we used the echellette mode .",
    "the spectral range covers 3900 to 11,000 , and the spectral resolution is r @xmath25 27000 .",
    "we set the slit width 10 and the slit orientation so that the two stellar components ( components a and b ; see figure [ fig : mag_all ] ) were on the slit ( thus , component g should be also on the slit , but we were not able to extract the spectrum of component g because it is much fainter than the quasar components ) .",
    "the exposure time was 900 sec .",
    "since the seeing ( fwhm ) was about 07 and the angular separation between the two components is only 104 , we can clearly see there are two objects on the slit but these are not well resolved .",
    "therefore we extracted the spectra using a method of summing the fluxes in a window around the position of the brighter component and in another window shifted by 104 .",
    "sky was subtracted using neighboring windows on either side of the trace .",
    "there are bad columns on the esi chip between 4460  and 4560  , and therefore , we excluded the data of this bad region from the spectra .",
    "the binned spectra of components a and b taken with esi on keck ii are shown in figure [ fig : spec ] . in both spectra , , , and emission lines",
    "are clearly seen at the same wavelength positions .",
    "the redshifts of components a and b are 1.6820@xmath140.0001 and 1.6816@xmath140.0004 , which were calculated by fitting the voigt functions with the emission lines .",
    "the velocity difference between the two quasar components is 20 km sec@xmath26 km sec@xmath9 .",
    "the redshifts and the widths of the emission lines are summarized in table [ table : line ] .",
    "in addition to the identical redshift , the spectral energy distributions themselves are also quite similar .",
    "the bottom line in figure [ fig : spec ] shows the spectral flux ratio between components b and a. we find that this is almost constant for a wide range of wavelengths and this is almost consistent with the mean flux ratio ( 0.33 ) of the @xmath23 images .",
    "a large difference is seen around the emission line ; this might be caused by microlensing of the broad emission line region @xcite .",
    "in addition to the emission lines , we found a / absorption system redshifted to @xmath3 , as shown in figure [ fig : abs ] .",
    "this absorption system probably arises from a lensing galaxy , both because galaxies can produce such absorption systems @xcite and because the / absorption system ( @xmath3 ) is not so far from the half of the angular diameter distance to the quasar components ( @xmath27 ) that has the maximum lensing efficiency @xcite .",
    "this prediction is further supported by the comparison of the expected magnitude by the mass models with the observed magnitude of the lensing galaxy ( see  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we found two absorption systems , whose redshifts are 1.537 and 1.531 ( both at @xmath12 7100  ) , with their absorption lines ( at @xmath12 6600  , @xmath12 6000  , and so on ) and weaker absorption lines of other elements .",
    "moreover , at @xmath12 7100  , we found two possible absorption systems whose redshifts are 1.540 and 1.533 , although their absorption lines and other element absorption lines were not detected in the spectra .",
    "however these 4 absorption systems are unlikely to be associated with the lensing system , because the difference between the redshift of the source quasar and that of the absorption systems is small .",
    "our final observation of sdss  j0246@xmath00825 was conducted using the _ hubble space telescope _",
    ", under the `` _ hst _ imaging of gravitational lenses '' program ( principal investigator : c.  s. kochanek , proposal i d : cycle129744 ) .",
    "we used the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; * ? ? ? * ) and the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , installed on the _ hst_. the acs and nicmos observations were conducted on 2003 october 13 and 2003 december 18 , respectively .",
    "we used f555w filter ( @xmath28-band ) and the f814w filter ( @xmath29-band ) in the acs observation and the f160w filter ( @xmath30-band ) in the nicmos observation .",
    "the acs imaging observation consists of two dithered exposures taken in accum mode .",
    "total exposure time of each dithered exposure for the f555w filter was 1094 sec and that for the f814w filter was 1144 sec .",
    "the reduced ( drizzled and calibrated ) images were extracted using the calacs calibration pipeline which includes the pydrizzle algorithm . the combined image of the f555w filter and that of the f814w filter are shown in the left panels of figure  [ fig : acs ] . as well as the nirc @xmath24 band image ( figure [ fig : keck - k ] )",
    ", we find the extended object ( component g ) between the two quasar components in the acs images , particularly in the f814w image .",
    "the extended nature and the red color of component g suggest that this object is a galaxy .",
    "in addition to the identical nature of the spectral energy distributions of components a and b ( described in  [ sec : keck ] ) , the existence of the galaxy strongly supports the lensing hypothesis ; we conclude that sdss  0246@xmath00825 is certainly a lensed quasar system .",
    "although the spectrum of component g has not been obtained yet , the color of component g ( @xmath31 , estimated from the psf - subtracted images , the right panels of figure  [ fig : acs ] ) is consistent with it being a galaxy at @xmath3 @xcite , which is the redshift of / absorption system seen in the spectra of components a and b ( see figure  [ fig : abs ] ) .",
    "in addition to the central extended object ( component g ) , we find a highly distorted object ( named component c ) in the upper left of component a. similar `` ring '' features of lensed ( host ) galaxies have been found in the optical and/or near - infrared band images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore this object is probably the lensed host galaxy of the source quasar of sdss  0246@xmath00825 . to improve the visibility of this distorted feature , we subtract components a and b using the quasar psfs produced by the tiny tim software ( version 6.1a ; * ? ? ?",
    "the psfs of quasars were constructed with the keck spectra of components a and b. the result is shown in the right panels of figure  [ fig : acs ] .",
    "component c is bright even in the f555w filter image as well as the f814w filter image ( see figure [ fig : acs ] ) ; the blue color of component c indicates that the host galaxy might be a starburst galaxy .",
    "the ( magnification ) center of component c is 050 away from that of component a in the image plane , but the similar phenomenon have been observed in another lensed quasar system @xcite . see  [ sec : model ] for the comparison of this `` ring '' and mass models .",
    "the nicmos imaging observation consists of four dithered exposures taken in multiaccum mode , through the f160w filter ( @xmath30-band ) .",
    "the exposure time was 640 sec for three dithered exposures and 704 sec for one dithered exposure .",
    "the reduced ( calibrated ) images were extracted using the calnica pipeline .",
    "the central bad columns of each dithered image were corrected by linear interpolation .",
    "the combined image is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : nicmos ] .",
    "first , we confirm the existence of the central extended object ( component g ) between components a and b , and the highly distorted object ( component c ) near component a. in addition , we find a further highly distorted object , which is similar to component c , near component b in the f160w image .",
    "to improve the visibility of them , we subtract components a and b using the quasar psfs produced by the tiny tim software . the psf of a quasar was constructed with an @xmath32 power law spectrum .",
    "the peak flux and the center coordinates of components a and b in the nicmos f160w image were calculated using the imexamine task in iraf .",
    "the result is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : nicmos ] ; one can clearly see the distorted objects form a nearly perfect ring .",
    "this prefect ring feature can be also seen in the psf - subtracted nirc @xmath24 band image ( figure [ fig : keck - k ] ) .",
    "the psf magnitudes of components a and b and the aperture magnitude of component g in f160w filter ( @xmath30-band ) are summarized in table [ table : pos ] . in estimating the aperture magnitude of component g",
    ", we used the aperture radius of 0375 in the psf subtracted image .",
    "we model the lensed quasar system using two mass models .",
    "one is the singular isothermal sphere with external shear ( sis+shear ) model , with a projected potential of @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the einstein radius in arcseconds , @xmath17 and @xmath35 are the radial and the angular parts of the angular position on the sky , respectively , and @xmath36 is the position angle of the shear , measured east of north . the other is the singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) model , with a projected potential of @xmath37^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the lens axis ratio and the @xmath39 is the position angle of the ellipse , measured east of north . since component a is saturated in both the acs f555w image and the f814w image , we adopted the positions and flux of components a and b in the magic image and the position of component g in the acs ( f814w ) image . in order to obtain the position of g relative to a",
    ", we used the positions of components b and g in the acs f814w image and the position angle of the acs image , 120.37 degree .",
    "these observables are summarized in table [ table : pos ] .",
    "we use the _ lensmodel _ software @xcite to model the lensed quasar system .",
    "both mass models have eight parameters ; @xmath34 , @xmath40 , @xmath36 , the lensing galaxy position , the source quasar position , and the source quasar flux for the sis+shear model ; @xmath34 , ellipticity @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath39 , the lensing galaxy position , the source quasar position , and the source quasar flux for the sie model .",
    "since we have only eight constraints ( positions of two lensed components and the lensing galaxy , and the fluxes of lensed components ) , the number of degrees of freedom is zero .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ table : model1 ] and table [ table : model2 ] .",
    "the critical curve in the image plane and the caustics in the source plane of the sis+shear model are shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : model1 ] , and those of the sie model are shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : model1 ] , respectively .",
    "the best - fit models predict the time delay between the two lensed images to be @xmath43 day for the sis+shear model and @xmath44 day for the sie model ( @xmath45 km sec@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 ) , assuming that the redshift of the lensing galaxy is 0.724 .",
    "both the mass models predict the einstein radius @xmath34 of about 055 , which corresponds to the velocity dispersion ( in one direction ) of the lensing galaxy of @xmath46 km sec@xmath9 at @xmath3 . using the faber - jackson law @xcite , @xmath47 and @xmath48 km sec@xmath9 @xcite , and k- and evolution - correction for elliptical galaxies ( inada 2004 ; 1.0 and @xmath00.1 , respectively , derived from the model of poggianti 1997 and the sdss filter response function ) , the @xmath18-band magnitude of the lensing galaxy is predicted to be 22.1 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the @xmath18-band magnitude of component g , 21.8 .",
    "thus these mass models further support that the redshift of the lensing galaxy is 0.724 .",
    "although the number of degrees of freedom is zero in the above mass models , we were not able to reproduce the observables perfectly . the observed flux ratio between components b and a are @xmath49 , while the predicted flux ratios are 0.58 for the sis+shear model and 0.54 for the sie model ( see table [ table : model1 ] ) . the differences between the observed flux ratio and the predicted flux ratios are very large and therefore can not be explained by the observed data errors . to explore the discrepancy",
    ", we speculate that an unknown object near component g ( we named this _ hypothetical _ second lensing object `` g@xmath50 '' ) causes the discrepancy . in order to minimize the difference between the numbers of constraints and parameters",
    ", we simply applied the sis model for both g and g@xmath50 ( i.e. , we did not consider the shear and the ellipticity ) .",
    "this model , however , has nine parameters and is under - constrained ( the number of the difference between the constraints and the parameters is 1 ) , thus we required that the einstein radius of g@xmath50 should not be so large , smaller than @xmath12 020 ; this is natural since g@xmath50 should not be the dominant contribution .",
    "we varied @xmath51 of g@xmath50 between 001 and 020 , and search for the best - fit models for each value of @xmath51 of g@xmath50 .",
    "we found that well - fitted models ( @xmath52 ) exist for each @xmath51 of g@xmath50 between @xmath53 and @xmath54 . a result for the case that the einstein radius of g@xmath50 is 007 is summarized in table [ table : model1 ] and table [ table : model2 ] ; the predicted flux ratio between components b and a is 0.33 .",
    "if we simply apply the faber - jackson law , the einstein radius of the sis model is proportional to @xmath55 ; thus that the einstein radius of g@xmath50 is 007 corresponds to g@xmath50 @xmath56 mag fainter than g if we assume that g@xmath50 is at the same redshift of g. this is consistent with the fact that we can not see any objects at the predicted position of g@xmath50 in the acs images even after the pfs subtraction . the critical curve in the image plane and the caustics in the source plane of this model ( 2 sis lens model for @xmath57(g@xmath50)@xmath58007 )",
    "are shown in figure [ fig : model2 ] , and the predicted time delay of this model is @xmath59 day .",
    "we note that the total magnification factors of all mass models ( especially 2 sis lens model ) are much higher than those of the previously known two - image lensed quasars , e.g. , he1104@xmath01805 @xcite .    in the above lens models",
    ", it is expected that the shape of the lensed host galaxy , if it exists , is similar to that of the critical curve , because the quadruple moments are negligible and the source is close to the center of the lens system @xcite . to compare the ring feature observed in the nicmos image and the critical curve of the best - fit mass model , we overplot the critical curve predicted by the 2 sis lens model on the nicmos ring , after subtracting the central lensing galaxy and excluding the pixels around components a and b. the result is shown in figure [ fig : ring ] .",
    "the red dot - dashed line in figure [ fig : ring ] connects the pixels that have the maximum count rate in each column ; thus it almost corresponds to the structure of the observed ring .",
    "in addition to the 2 sis lens model , we also find that the critical curves of the sis+shear model and the sie model are in good agreement with the observed ring .",
    "a possible objection of this interpretation is that the magnification center of the observed ring is largely different from the center of component a in both the acs and the nicmos images ; the ring might not be associated to the source quasar but be a background galaxy lensed by the same lensing galaxy .",
    "we have reported the discovery of the doubly - imaged gravitationally lensed quasar at @xmath2 with the separation angle 104 , sdss  j0246@xmath00825 , which was selected from the sdss data .",
    "the redshift of the lensing galaxy is likely to be @xmath3 , judged from the absorption lines in the spectra of the quasar components and the apparent magnitude of the galaxy combined with the expected absolute magnitude from the faber - jackson relation .",
    "we found that the simple mass models ( sis+shear and sie ) with reasonable parameters well reproduce the lensing geometry of sdss  j0246@xmath00825 but do not reproduce the flux ratio between the lensed quasar components .",
    "thus , we speculated that there is another lensing object near the lensed quasar system ; we found possible lens models which can reproduce both the lensing geometry and the flux ratio , by introducing a faint second lensing object .",
    "all of the best fit models ( including the sis + shear model and the sie model ) predicts the time delay between the two lensed images to be @xmath60 days .",
    "in addition to the two lensed images , we have found a highly distorted object in the _ hst _ acs and nicmos images .",
    "in particular , in the near infrared ( nicmos ) image this object forms a nearly perfect ring .",
    "since the critical curves of the best fit models show a good agreement with the ring , this is likely to be the lensed host galaxy of the source quasar .",
