    "in recent years techniques of computational commutative algebra found applications in many fields , such as optimization @xcite , computational biology @xcite , and statistics @xcite .",
    "particularly , the algebraic view of discrete statistical models has been applied in many statistical problems , including conditional inference @xcite , disclosure limitation @xcite , the maximum likelihood estimation @xcite , and parametric inference @xcite .",
    "_ algebraic statistics _ is a new field , less than a decade old , and its term was coined by pistone , riccomagno and wynn , by the title of their book @xcite .",
    "computational algebraic statistics has been very actively developed by both algebraists and statisticians since the pioneering work of diaconis and sturmfels @xcite .",
    "for sampling from a finite sample space using markov chain monte carlo methods , diaconis and sturmfels @xcite defined the notion of markov bases and showed that a markov basis is equivalent to a system of binomial generators of a toric ideal .    in statistical applications ,",
    "the number of indeterminates is often large , and at the same time , there exists some inherent symmetry in the toric ideal .",
    "for this reason , we encounter computational difficulty in applying grbner bases to statistical problems . in particular , even the reduced grbner basis of a toric ideal may contain more than several thousands elements , but one might be able to describe the basis concisely using symmetry .",
    "for example , @xcite shows that the unique minimal markov bases for @xmath0 contingency tables with fixed two - dimensional marginals contain only @xmath1 orbits with respect to the group actions of permuting levels for each axis of contingency tables , while there are @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 elements in reduced grbner bases for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "furthermore in this example the reduced grbner basis contains dispensable binomials and is not minimal .",
    "because of the difficulty mentioned above , the first two authors of this paper have been investigating the question of minimality of markov bases . in @xcite , we defined the notion of indispensable moves , which belong to every markov basis .",
    "we showed that there exists a unique minimal markov basis if and only if the set of indispensable moves forms a markov basis .",
    "shortly after , ohsugi and hibi investigated indispensable binomials .",
    "they showed that the set of indispensable binomials coincides with the intersection of all reduced grbner basis with respect to lexicographic term orders in @xcite .",
    "thus , we are interested in enumerating indispensable binomials of a given toric ideal . however , in general",
    ", the enumeration itself is a difficult problem .",
    "this paper proposes the notion of indispensable monomials and investigate some of their properties .",
    "the set of indispensable monomials contains all terms of indispensable binomials",
    ". therefore if we could enumerate indispensable monomials , then it would be straightforward to enumerate indispensable binomials . here",
    "it may seem that we are replacing a hard problem by a harder one .",
    "computationally this may well be the case , but we believe that the notion of indispensable monomials may be useful for understanding indispensable binomials and finding the existence of the unique minimal markov basis .    in section [ sec : preliminaries ] we will set notation and summarize relevant results from @xcite . in section [ sec : definition ] we will define indispensable monomials and prove some basic properties of the indispensable monomials .",
    "further characterizations of indispensable monomials are given in section [ sec : more - properties ] and some nontrivial examples are given in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "we will conclude with some discussions in section [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "in this section we will set appropriate notation and then summarize main results from @xcite . because of the fundamental equivalence mentioned in @xcite , we use `` system of binomial generators '' and `` markov basis '' synonymously",
    ". other pairs of synonyms used in this paper are ( `` binomial'',``move '' ) , ( `` monomial '' , `` frequency vector '' ) and ( `` indeterminate '' , `` cell '' ) , as explained below .",
    "because this paper is based on @xcite , we follow its notation and terminology in statistical context .",
    "also we adapt some notation in @xcite .",
    "vectors , through this paper , are column vectors and @xmath7 denotes the transpose of the vector @xmath8 .    let @xmath9 be a finite set of @xmath10 elements .",
    "each element of @xmath9 is called a _ cell_. by ordering cells , we write @xmath11 hereafter .",
    "a nonnegative integer @xmath12 is a _ frequency _ of a cell @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a _ frequency vector _",
    "( nonnegative integer vector ) .",
    "we write @xmath15 to denote the _ sample size _ of @xmath8 . in a framework of similar tests in statistical theory ( see chapter 4 of @xcite ) ,",
    "we consider a @xmath16-dimensional sufficient statistic defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a @xmath16-dimensional fixed integral column vector for @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 denote a @xmath21 integral matrix , where @xmath22 is the @xmath23-th element of @xmath24 .",
    "then the _ sufficient statistic _",
    "@xmath25 is written as @xmath26 .",
    "the set of frequency vectors for a given sufficient statistic @xmath25 is called a _ @xmath25-fiber _ defined by @xmath27 a frequency vector @xmath8 @xmath28 belongs to the fiber @xmath29 by definition .",
    "we assume that a toric ideal is homogeneous , i.e.  there exists @xmath30 such that @xmath31 , @xmath32 . in this case the sample size of @xmath25 is well defined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",

    "let @xmath51=k[t_1,\\ldots , t_d , t_1^{-1},\\ldots , t_d^{-1}]$ ] denote the laurent polynomial ring .",

    "if adding @xmath62 to @xmath8 does not produce negative elements , we see that @xmath70 is moved to another element @xmath71 by @xmath62 . in this case",

    "a markov basis @xmath82 is _ minimal _ if no proper subset of @xmath82 is a markov basis .",
    "a minimal markov basis always exists , because from any markov basis , we can remove redundant elements one by one until none of the remaining elements can be removed any further . in defining minimality of markov basis",

    ", we immediately have a necessarily and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique minimal markov basis .",
    "a minimal markov basis is unique if and only if for each @xmath25 , @xmath109 itself forms one @xmath104-equivalence class or @xmath113 is a two - element fiber .",
    "this condition is explicitly expressed by _",
    "indispensable moves_.    a move @xmath64 is called indispensable if @xmath65 and @xmath66 form a two - element fiber , i.e. , the fiber @xmath114 is written as @xmath115 .    from the above definition and the structure of a minimal markov basis",
    ", one can show that every indispensable move belongs to each markov basis ( lemma 2.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , by the correspondence between moves and binomials , we define an _",

    "a set of indispensable moves plays an important role to determine the uniqueness of a minimal markov basis :    [ lemmamb ] the unique minimal markov basis exists if and only if the set of indispensable moves forms a markov basis . in this case",

    "in this section we will define indispensable monomials .",
    "then we will show two other equivalent conditions for a monomial to be indispensable .",

    ", any markov basis contains all indispensable monomials .",
    "therefore the set of indispensable monomials is finite .",
    "note that both terms of an indispensable binomial @xmath122 are indispensable monomials , but the converse does not hold in general .",
    "now we will present an alternative definition .",
    "@xmath8 is a minimal multi - element if @xmath123 and @xmath124 for every @xmath125 .",

    "we now have shown that each minimal multi - element has to be contained in each markov basis , i.e. , a minimal multi - element is an indispensable monomial .",

    "this is the same difficulty mentioned in section 2.2 in @xcite .",
