    "core - dominated quasar 3c  273 is one of the most confirmed objects on account of high optical luminosity and low redshift ( @xmath2 ; bridle & perley 1984 ) .",
    "the image obtained with the refurbished _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) revealed that the narrow optical jet consists of discrete knots ( bahcall et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter b95 ) associated with shocks . in radio bands the high linear polarization and featureless spectra",
    "imply that the observed emission from the knots is originated in the synchrotron radiation of electrons ( and possibly positrons ) .",
    "if the optical emission is also of the synchrotron origin , _ in situ _ acceleration of electrons must be just taking place , as they are compatible with the synchrotron lifetime inferred from magnetic field strength ( meisenheimer et al .",
    "1989 : m89 ) .",
    "polarization data in optical bands are similar to those in radio ones , and suggest that the optical emission is attributed to the synchrotron losses of accelerated electrons ( rser & meisenheimer 1991 : rm91 ; conway et al .",
    "1993 : c93 ; rser et al . 1996 ) . in the brightest knot",
    "a , the observed power - law spectrum ( @xmath3 ) can be fitted by the index of @xmath4 ( m89 ) , close to the canonical value of @xmath5 for the electron spectral index @xmath6 , expected for fermi acceleration at strong nonrelativistic shocks .    as far as such an acceleration mechanism works for electrons ,",
    "the same mechanism will operate for acceleration of ions likewise , providing their abundance in the jet is finite ( e.g. , rawlings & saunders 1991 ) .",
    "one of the most promising mechanisms is the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) involving resonant scattering of injected particles , in which the particles trapped in a mean magnetic field are resonantly scattered by the alfvn waves superposed on the mean field ( for review , drury 1983 ; blandford & eichler 1987 ; jones & ellison 1991 ; longair 1992 : l92 ) , so as to migrate back and forth between the upstream and downstream region of the shock . as a consequence ,",
    "the particles are accelerated , receiving energy from the shock . in this context",
    ", biermann & strittmatter ( 1987 ) have discussed the possibility of ultrahigh energy acceleration of protons .",
    "however , their description was limited to a simple case for parallel shock propagating along magnetic field lines .",
    "rachen & biermann ( 1993 ) estimated the highest proton energy as @xmath7 , but it seems to be rather optimistic .    for precise evaluation of the highest energy , it is important to consider the actual magnetic field geometry in the acceleration site . with regard to this point ,",
    "a helical pattern of the magnetized jet has recently been observed by the faraday rotation measures in the _ highly advanced laboratory for communications and astronomy _ vlbi space observatory programme ( asada et al .",
    "2002 ) , and it appears to self - organize _",
    "double helical _ structure ( lobanov & zensus 2001 : lz01 ) .",
    "in such a filamentary jet , expected is that huge current ( @xmath8 : c93 ) generates substantial magnetic fields transverse to the filaments ( honda , meyer - ter - vehn & pukhov 2000 ; honda & honda 2002 : hh02 ) .",
    "anyhow , when allowing shock propagation along the jet concomitant with _",
    "non_-parallel components of the magnetic fields , the shock likely crosses the field lines .",
    "this corresponds to the configuration of the `` _ oblique shock _ '' , for which acceleration efficiency is higher than that for the parallel shock , owing to the effects of mirror - reflection of particles at the shock front ( jokipii 1987 ; ostrowski 1988 : o88 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we report a result of the numerical analysis for the highest energy of proton diffusively accelerated by the oblique shock in knot  a1 of 3c  273 jet .",
    "the present model of the oblique dsa is on the basis of the first - order fermi mechanism including the resonant scattering of particles by the kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "concerning quench of acceleration and energy loss processes , more solid argument is expanded .",
    "we demonstrate that for an expected range of radiation energy density , the maximum proton energy exceeding @xmath1 is _ safely _ achieved , especially for quasiperpendicular shock acceleration .",
    "below we outline the physical properties and parameters at the knot in the leading edge of the jet of 3c  273 , which is specified as `` knot a1 '' ( b95 ) , or `` knot a '' in earlier literatures .",
    "the knot  a1 is well - resolved in optical wavelengths ( @xmath9 for hst ) , and its radius is about @xmath10 ( rser et al . 2000 :",
    "this optical core is encased in the larger radio cocoon whose half - width is @xmath11 ( b95 ) ; and the overall structure seems to correspond to the `` hot spot '' ( in the nomenclature for fanaroff - riley ii sources ; rachen & biermann 1993 ) , which may be related to the upper limit of the size of shocks .",
    "the key feature of this knot is that x - ray flux is more prominent than that observed in the other knots ( marshall et al .",
    "2001 : m01 ) . extrapolating the radio - to - optical spectrum to high - energy region approximately reproduces the observed x - ray continuum ( r00 ) .",
    "accordingly , for the x - ray as well , the power - law spectrum ( with index @xmath12 ; m01 ) can be explained by the electron - synchrotron model ( sambruna et al .",
    "2001 ) , rather than the other models invoking the inverse compton scattering of electrons .",
    "the size of the x - ray halo , where a large amount of energetic particles is probably drifting , appears to larger than that of the radio hot spot ( r00 ; m01 ) , implying that the spatioscale of confinement region of accelerated particles tends to be larger than that of shock accelerator .    in the knot distant more than @xmath13 from core ( b95 ) ,",
    "the flow is decelerated to the weak relativistic speed of @xmath14 ( m89 ) , where @xmath15 is the speed of light , although in the vicinity of core , superluminal motion of ejecta is observed",
    ". the flow may be collimated by magnetic fields ( hh02 ) , resulting in no significant radial expansion .",
    "polarization measurements suggest the ordered magnetic field , and its strength is of the order of sub - milligauss at this knot ( m89 ; r00 ) .",
    "the degree of polarization increases toward the direction of the bending extended structure , called `` inner extension '' ( rm91 ) , indicating that the field lines are inclined with respect to the jet axis .      for knot  a1 , presuming the shock speed to be nonrelativistic is adequate for modeling the dsa based on the fermi - i mechanism ( gaisser 1990 : g90 ) .",
    "we consider the fast - mode oblique shock , for which magnetic field strength is boosted to @xmath16 , where the subscripts @xmath171 and 2 indicate the upstream and downstream region , @xmath18 denotes the inclination angle of mean magnetic field line with respect to the direction normal to shock surface , and @xmath19 is the shock compression ratio .",
    "in contrast with the case of the parallel shock with @xmath20 in which particles are deflected due solely to scattering by magnetic field fluctuations , in the @xmath21 case a fraction of the particles is directly reflected at the shock front by the boosted field in the region 2 , conforming to the conservation of magnetic moment .",
    "expected here is that effect of this mirror - reflection leads to significant reduction of acceleration time , _",
    "viz_. , increase of acceleration efficiency ( e.g. , kirk & heavens 1989 : kh89 ) .",
    "indeed , this effect has been confirmed by the monte carlo simulations for a nonrelativistic shock ( naito & takahara 1995 ; ellison , baring & jones 1995 ) .",
    "for calculation of energy gain of particles , we transfer from plasma rest frames of the regions 1 and 2 to a proper frame where electric field vanishes ( de hoffmann & teller 1950 : ht50 ) ; then , transform physical variables back to those in the original frame ( o88 ) .",
    "the mean acceleration time can be defined as the cycle time for one back - and - forth between the region 1 and 2 divided by the energy gain per encounter with the shock ( g90 ) .",
    "an improved calculation including the mirror - reflection effects yields the following resultant of the mean acceleration time ( kobayakawa , honda & samura 2002 : khs02 ) : @xmath22}{(\\cos^{2}\\theta_{1}+r^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{1})^{3/2 } } \\right\\},\\ ] ] for arbitrary species of particle @xmath23. here , @xmath24 is the shock speed , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 the speed of the particle , and furthermore , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 the mean free - path ( m.f.p . ) along the magnetic field line , @xmath29 the gyroradius in the region 1 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 the rest mass and charge of the particle , respectively .",
    "note the allowable range of the field inclination angle of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is called the de hoffmann - teller ( ht ) limit for oblique shocks ( ht50 ; kh89 ; khs02 ) .    in equation  ( 1 ) , the shock compression ratio is fixed to @xmath35 for a strong nonrelativistic shock .",
    "we compare the magnetic fluctuations involved in the shock to the kolmogorov turbulence establishing the spectral intensity of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the wavenumber of the alfvn waves ( e.g. , biermann & strittmatter 1987 : bs87 ) . in the circumstances that when the wave - particle resonance condition , @xmath38 , is satisfied , the pitch - angle scattering of particles becomes effective , the m.f.p . can be denoted as @xmath39(r_{\\rm g , max}/r_{{\\rm g},a})^{2/3}$ ] . here",
    ", @xmath40 defines the maximum resonant gyroradius , and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) the ratio of turbulent to mean magnetic energy density .",
    "notice that setting to @xmath43 makes the local inclination angle fluctuate around the average @xmath18 . nevertheless , this choice is feasible , as long as the trajectory of the guiding center drift of the particles bounded by the mean field is not disturbed , that is , the characteristic timescale of the drift in the shock vicinity is shorter than the coherence time for the resonant scattering .",
    "as shown later , this condition turns out to be fairly satisfied in the allowable range of @xmath44 . in this aspect ,",
    "let us set to the critical value , @xmath45 , adequate for simple estimation of the _ achievable highest _ energy of accelerated particles , and convenient for making a direct comparison with a previous result in the special case for parallel shock [ bs87 , expecting @xmath46 .    as the jet seems to be _",
    "nonuniformly filled _ , having helical filaments ( lz01 ) , we allow the hot spot with its radius @xmath47 to contain _ multipartite _ shock disks , whose radial size each is associated with the order of maximum turbulent wavelength , @xmath48 . in order for the resonance to be locked in phase , the gyroradius can not exceed @xmath48 , which is limited by @xmath47 .",
    "that is , we have the relation of @xmath49 . in a specific case that the knot feature is identified with a _",
    "shock , we reproduce @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51 , referred to as the hillas criterion ( hillas 1984 : h84 ) . below we regard , in equation  ( 1 ) , @xmath40 as a variable in the range of @xmath52 .      by equating the mean acceleration time ( 1 ) with the shortest timescale for the most severe energy restriction , we can derive the maximum possible energy of particles , defined as @xmath53 .",
    "for proton ( @xmath23=p ) , the time - balance equation can be expressed as @xmath54.\\ ] ] here , @xmath55 defines the cooling time for synchrotron radiation by the accelerated protons ( l92 ) , where @xmath56 is the thomson cross section .",
    "the loss timescale may be rewritten as @xmath57 .",
    "also , the inelastic collision with photons involving photopionization can be a competitive energy loss process .",
    "for the present purpose , we employ an approximate expression of the loss timescale , @xmath58 $ ] ( for 3c  273 ; bs87 ) , where @xmath59 stands for average energy density of target radiation fields .",
    "the above expression scales as @xmath60 .",
    "in addition to the loss due to such elementary processes , the particle escape itself quenches the acceleration .",
    "the escape time can be estimated as @xmath61 $ ] ( h84 ) , where @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) represents the radius of the x - ray halo confining energetic particles ( see sec .",
    "the timescale can be expressed as @xmath64 . furthermore , the propagation time of shock through the jet possibly limits the acceleration , while the radial adiabatic expansion is _ less _ effective for the self - collimating jet ( hh02 ) , in contrast with spherically expanding supernova remnant shocks ( khs02 ) .",
    "the shock propagation time @xmath65 may be interpreted as the age of the knot , which is crudely estimated as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 represents a distance from core to the knot and @xmath68 the speed of proper motion of the knot ; to give the scaling of @xmath69 .",
    "now , given @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath59 , we self - consistently solve equation  ( 2 ) for @xmath72 .",
    "along the explanations mentioned above , at the moment we choose the physical parameters of 3c  273/a1 as @xmath73 ( m89 ) , @xmath74 ( r00 ) , @xmath75 ( b95 ) , @xmath76 ( m01 ) , and @xmath77 ( b95 ) .",
    "it is noted that the maximum inclination angle of magnetic field lines reaches @xmath78 , and @xmath79 for @xmath35 , appropriate for referring to as `` quasiperpendicular shock '' .    in figure  1 for @xmath80 (",
    "left panel ) and @xmath81 ( right panel ) , we show @xmath82 as a function of @xmath40 ( @xmath48 ) , for some given values of @xmath59 as a parameter . in a wide range of smaller @xmath40 and larger @xmath59 ,",
    "@xmath83 is determined by the balance of @xmath84 in equation  ( 2 ) ( dotted curves / lines ) . for much smaller @xmath59 , @xmath83 saturates ,",
    "being determined by @xmath85 in a large-@xmath40 region ( soild curve / line ) , whereas in a small-@xmath40 region , by @xmath86 for @xmath87 ( dot - dashed curve / line ) .",
    "even for the chosen ( rather small ) value of @xmath67 , @xmath65 can not be the shortest timescale in right - hand side of equation  ( 2 ) . in the both panels , bottom side of short - dashed line : @xmath88 and left side of long - dashed line : @xmath89 indicate the allowable and plausible region , respectively .",
    "note that a point of intersection of these two lines , which represents the hillas criterion , @xmath90 , is in a marginal region above the solid curve / line .",
    "the region of @xmath91 far above the short - dashed line , i.e. , @xmath92 for @xmath45 , can be compared to the `` diffusive limit '' ( o88 ) which violates equation  ( 1 ) .    in the case of @xmath93 ,",
    "the values of @xmath83 monotonically decrease as @xmath40 increases , to exhibit the scaling of @xmath94 for the cases of @xmath95 and @xmath86 , and @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "these tendencies reflect the resonant scattering theory in which longer coherence time ( i.e. , longer gyroperiod ) leads to lower acceleration efficiency . for @xmath21 , however , @xmath83 is found to be significantly enhanced . as seen in the case of @xmath80 , the resulting boost of @xmath83",
    "is prominent in the region below the short - dashed line .",
    "this property suggests a picture that larger value of @xmath98 in equation  ( 1 ) effectively represents larger anisotropy of diffusion coefficients , i.e. , for @xmath99 ( corresponding to the `` free crossing limit '' ; o88 ) , @xmath100 , where the subscripts refer to the direction of the magnetic field line ; they largely assist the mirror - reflection of particles ( see also figure  2 below ) .    we are particularly concerned with the _ actual _ maximum energy of accelerated proton exceeding @xmath1 . in the left panel ,",
    "hatched domain indicates the window where @xmath83 exceeds @xmath1 for the condition of @xmath101 . in this domain",
    ", it is found that @xmath83 depends largely on the value of @xmath59 , which involves a large uncertainty responsible for observation . at this juncture",
    ", we infer the value of @xmath59 from comparing the observed highest frequency of radiation with the synchrotron cut - off frequency deduced from the calculated maximum energy of electron .",
    "this is feasible , because the x - ray from knot  a1 is arguably ascribed to the simple synchrotron emission due to accelerated electrons ( sec .",

    ", @xmath103 denotes the familiar electron synchrotron timescale , and @xmath104 the timescale for the inverse compton scattering ( bs87 ; l92 ) , where @xmath105 the klein - nishina cross section . for @xmath80 ,",
    "we have numerically calculated at @xmath106 , and the synchrotron cut - off frequency by using the expression of @xmath107 ( bs87 ) . as a consequence , consistency of the calculated @xmath108 with the observed result @xmath109 ( r00 ) is found to require @xmath110 in the region of @xmath111 ( not shown in figure ) .",
    "note that the upper limit of @xmath59 is close to the value inferred from the energy equipartition , @xmath112 . on the other hand , for @xmath93 we get @xmath113 ( bs87 ) in the same region of @xmath40 , such that @xmath114 .",
    "for the expected value of @xmath115 , we see in figure  1 that at @xmath116 , the actual maximum energies of proton are @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively . for the @xmath80 case ,",
