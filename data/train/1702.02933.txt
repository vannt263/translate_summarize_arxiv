    "after the tremendous success of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity @xcite interest quickly turned towards the possibility of other more exotic forms of superconductivity ( or fermionic superfluidity ) .",
    "one of the first theoretical proposals for a novel superconductor was the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) @xcite state , predicted to occur in systems with mismatched fermi energies , i.e. ,  a spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 population imbalance .",
    "the fflo state is predicted to occur , for a conventional three - dimensional @xmath2-wave superconductor , very close to the so - called chandrasekhar - clogston ( cc ) limit @xcite , which is the point where the energy penalty due to the fermi energy mismatch is larger than the energy gained from pairing .",
    "the resulting first order phase transition from the bcs phase to an imbalanced normal phase that occurs at the cc limit has been well established experimentally in both electronic superconductors in an externally applied magnetic field and also cold fermionic atomic gases under an imposed population imbalance . however , the fflo state , which is theoretically predicted to occupy a region of the phase diagram close to the cc limit , has never been observed .    unlike the bcs state , the cooper pairs of the fflo state exhibit a spatial variation in the local pair amplitude . in a homogeneous system",
    "the corresponding fflo wavevector @xmath3 is approximately equal to the difference of the fermi surface wave vectors @xmath4 for the majority ( denoted by spin-@xmath0 ) and minority ( spin-@xmath1 ) fermion species .",
    "the pairing amplitude takes the form @xmath5 in the ff phase and @xmath6 in the lo phase , with the latter believed to be more stable than the former .",
    "unfortunately , experimental verification has been lacking , and although some evidence of the fflo state has been seen in cold atom  @xcite and condensed matter  @xcite settings , no signature of the periodic modulation of the order parameter has been observed to date .",
    "the regime of stability of the fflo state , as a function of parameters such as interaction strength and population imbalance , is theoretically predicted to be strongly dependent on dimensionality , with the regime of stability smallest in three dimensions  @xcite , becoming larger for two spatial dimensions  @xcite and largest in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "although many experiments on imbalanced fermi gases have investigated the three - dimensional regime  @xcite ( finding no evidence of the fflo state ) , recent experiments have explored fermi gases in one  @xcite or two spatial dimensions  @xcite using an appropriate trapping potential .",
    "schematic of the fflo wave function for a trapped one - dimensional gas eq .   with a population imbalance given by @xmath7 .",
    "spin-@xmath0 fermions at harmonic oscillator level @xmath8 are paired with spin-@xmath1 fermions at level @xmath9 ( our illustration is for the case of @xmath10 . )",
    "the excess spins-@xmath0 occupy low - energy levels with @xmath11 . ]    here , our major interest in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) regime , which has been the subject of extensive recent theoretical work .",
    "the theoretical work investigating the fflo state in 1d has ranged from applying bethe ansatz @xcite , density - matrix renormalization group @xcite , quantum monte carlo  @xcite , tight binding models @xcite , and self - consistent mean - field solutions to the gap equation @xcite .",
    "many of these methods only strictly apply to infinite 1d systems , further relying on the uncontrolled local density approximation ( lda ) to account for the effects of the trapping potential that is omnipresent in ultracold atomic experiments .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that a simple variational bcs - type wave function that involved pairing of harmonic - oscillator states could account for pairing correlations in a balanced trapped 1d gas without the necessity of invoking the lda . here , we propose a similar wave function for the imbalanced case that incorporates fflo pairing correlations in a natural way .",
    "the wave function is : @xmath12 where the quantum numbers @xmath13 label the discrete energy levels of the trapped gas and the arrow ( @xmath14 ) represents the atomic hyperfine state . in the following",
    ", the trapping potential will be taken to be harmonic .",
    "this wave function consists of two product factors acting on the vacuum , with the rightmost factor corresponding , physically , to the presence of imbalanced pairing correlations ( characterized by the variational parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) between a spin-@xmath0 fermion at level @xmath8 and a spin-@xmath1 fermion at level @xmath9 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the left most factor corresponds to a central filled core of unpaired spin-@xmath0 fermions .",
    "this variational wave function has a fixed total population imbalance ( or magnetization ) equal to @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , as we shall show below , the real - space local pairing amplitude associated with @xmath18 exhibits the oscillatory real - space pairing correlations expected for an fflo state . for these reasons ,",
    "we propose that this is a natural variational wave function to study the fflo state of a 1d trapped fermi system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : vare ] , we derive the variational energy equation using eq .   in the harmonic oscillator basis of the trapping potential .",
    "note that we work only in the zero - temperature limit , studying ground - state properties .",
    "we further discuss the necessity of allowing the oscillator length scales associated with the single - particle basis to differ from that of the harmonic potential .",
    "the energy is then directly minimized numerically , without resorting to explicitly finding the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "the results of this minimization are presented and analyzed in sec .",
    "[ results ] , in which the density profiles and pairing amplitude are shown , as well as density - density correlations . in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] we make brief concluding remarks .    before proceeding to our calculations",
    ", we conclude this section by describing our main results .",
    "we find that an fflo state of imbalanced fermi gases , described by eq .",
    "( [ fflo wave function ] ) , is stable for sufficiently small magnetization ( @xmath19 ) , with a spatially modulated local pairing amplitude that is analogous to the lo phase of an infinite imbalanced gas , possessing nodes at which @xmath20 vanishes .",
    "however , we find that the oscillatory pairing amplitude does not leave any appreciable signature in the local density or local magnetization ( density difference , @xmath21 ) , such as a local increase in @xmath22 near the nodes of @xmath20 .",
    "our results for these densities agree qualitatively with experiment and theory based on combining the bethe ansatz with the lda  @xcite , showing an imbalanced central region and a paired ( balanced ) outer region at the edges of the cloud . with increasing @xmath19 ,",
    "the fflo phase becomes unstable ( as in three - dimensional imbalanced fermi gases ) to an unpaired fermi gas phase .",

    "the field operators can be expanded in terms of mode operators @xmath28 as @xmath29 and similarly for @xmath30 .",
    "the single - particle states are taken to be harmonic oscillator wave functions : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the hermite polynomials and @xmath33 are effective oscillator length scales .",
    "crucially , we include @xmath33 in the set of variational parameters .",
    "thus , in the presence of interactions , they are in general different from the natural oscillator length @xmath34 , which is determined by the trapping potential . in ref .",
    "@xcite the balanced case was studied using a similar variational wave function .",
    "it was found that including this additional variational parameter was necessary to allow the cloud size to decrease with increasing strength of attraction ( which is what is expected on physical grounds and is observed experimentally ) .",
    "similarly , in the imbalanced case , we allow the oscillator lengths to be variational parameters to obtain realistic density profiles . as discussed below , we find , in the imbalanced regime , that the optimal ( minimal energy ) values of the spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 oscillator lengths generally satisfy ( for attractive interactions ) @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this imples that interaction effects cause the two fermion species to each feel an effective trapping potential with a frequency that is larger than the actual trap frequency , with the majority species trap frequency slightly larger than that of the minority species .                    with @xmath37 the single - particle states , eq .",
    ", are no longer eigenstates of the kinetic energy term of the hamiltonian , eq .  .",
    "however , it is still straightforward to use the properties of the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions to express the hamiltonian in terms of the mode operators @xmath28 . in performing this step ,",
    "it is convenient to express the trapping potential as @xmath38 with @xmath39 the effective trap associated with the variational oscillator lengths . in terms of mode operators the hamiltonian can then be expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 with @xmath42 , and @xmath43 in eq .",

    "<S> we propose and analyze a variational wave function for a population - imbalanced one - dimensional fermi gas that allows for fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) type pairing correlations among the two fermion species , while also accounting for the harmonic confining potential . in the strongly interacting regime </S>",
    "<S> , we find large spatial oscillations of the order parameter , indicative of an fflo state . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained density profiles versus imbalance are consistent with recent experimental results as well as with theoretical calculations based on combining bethe ansatz with the local density approximation . </S>",
    "<S> although we find no signature of the fflo state in the densities of the two fermion species , we show that the oscillations of the order parameter appear in density - density correlations , both in - situ and after free expansion . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , above a critical polarization , the value of which depends on the interaction , we find the unpaired fermi - gas state to be energetically more favorable . </S>"
