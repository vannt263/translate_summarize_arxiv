    "after the discovery of super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) at the center of every massive galaxy in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the issue of how these smbhs formed and evolved over cosmic history has become one of the major unanswered questions in observational cosmology .",
    "luminosities of agns reflect the mass accretion rates of their smbhs , therefore the luminosity function of agns and its cosmological evolution reflects the growth history of smbhs through accretion .",
    "hard x - ray selection is an effective selection method for agns , it can detect obscured agns without serious bias , except for compton - thick agns , and can efficiently sample agns without contamination by a large number of star - forming galaxies . the hard x - ray luminosity function of agns and its evolution as a function of redshift have been examined with combining x - ray selected agn samples with various survey depths and areas @xcite .",
    "based on the cosmological evolution of the hard x - ray luminosity function , the average accretion growth curves of smbhs are inferred @xcite .    in order to construct a large sample of x - ray - selected agns , we have conducted deep multi - wavelength imaging observations covering the fuv to mir and deep optical and nir multi - object spectroscopic observations of the x - ray sources found in the subaru _ xmm - newton _ deep survey ( sxds ) @xcite .",
    "the x - ray images obtained with _ xmm - newton _ cover a 1.3 deg@xmath6 area down to @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 @xmath9 in the 0.52  kev band and @xmath10 erg s@xmath8 @xmath9 in the 210  kev band @xcite .",

    "several hard x - ray surveys covering @xmath13deg@xmath6 area in this flux range have been conducted @xcite . among the x - ray surveys with similar depth and area ,",

    "we have been conducting a large campaign of spectroscopic observations in the nir as well as in the optical wavelength range . because obscured agns at @xmath16 can be significant contributor to the x - ray source population , nir spectroscopy is effective in revealing their nature by detecting strong rest - frame optical emission lines .",

    "<S> we select a primary counterpart of each x - ray source by applying the likelihood ratio method to @xmath1-band , 3.6 , near - uv , and 24 source catalogs as well as matching catalogs of agn candidates selected in 1.4ghz radio and @xmath2-band variability surveys . </S>",
    "<S> once candidates of galactic stars , ultra - luminous x - ray sources in a nearby galaxy , and clusters of galaxies are removed there are 896 agn candidates in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> we conduct spectroscopic observations of the primary counterparts with multi - object spectrographs in the optical and nir ; 65% of the x - ray agn candidates are spectroscopically - identified . for the remaining x - ray agn candidates , we evaluate their photometric redshift with photometric data in 15 bands . utilising the multi - wavelength photometric data of the large sample of x - ray selected agns </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate the stellar masses , @xmath3 , of the host galaxies of the narrow - line agns . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the stellar mass is remarkably constant from @xmath4 to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between @xmath3 and 210  kev luminosity can be explained with strong cosmological evolution of the relationship between the black hole mass and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluate the scatter of the uv - mir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the x - ray agns as a function of x - ray luminosity and absorption to the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter is compared with galaxies which have redshift and stellar mass distribution matched with the x - ray agn . </S>",
    "<S> the uv - nir seds of obscured x - ray agns are similar to those of the galaxies in the matched sample . in the nir - mir range , the median seds of x - ray agns are redder , but the scatter of the seds of the x - ray agn broadly overlaps that of the galaxies in the matched sample . </S>"
