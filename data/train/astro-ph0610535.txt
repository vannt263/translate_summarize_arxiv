    "double - barred ( s2b ) galaxies , consisting of a small scale nuclear / secondary bar ( b2 ) embedded within a large scale primary bar ( b1 ) , have been known for over thirty years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite carefully compiled statistics for early - type optically - barred galaxies from images by both the wiyn telescope and the _ hubble space telescope _ , and concluded that at least one quarter of them are double - barred .",
    "the facts that inner bars are also seen in near - infrared ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that gas - poor s0s often contain inner bars indicate that most of them are stellar structures .",
    "s2bs may play an important role in the formation and nurture of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "s2b galaxies have been hypothesized to be a possible mechanism for driving gas past the inner lindblad resonance of b1s , feeding smbhs and powering agn @xcite . s2bs",
    "have also been suggested as a mechanism for forming smbhs directly @xcite .",
    "such fueling requires that the b2 and the b1 are dynamically decoupled . , where ( ) is the pattern speed of the b2 ( b1 ) . ]",
    "the random apparent orientations of b1s and b2s in nearly face - on galaxies points to dynamical decoupling @xcite . but images alone can not reveal how the two bars rotate through each other .",
    "kinematic evidence of decoupling , using either gas or stars , is harder to obtain @xcite .",
    "indirect evidence for decoupling was suggested by @xcite based on rotation velocity peaks inside the b2s in three s2b galaxies .",
    "conclusive direct kinematic evidence for a decoupled b2 was obtained for ngc 2950 by @xcite who showed , using the method of @xcite , that its b1 and b2 can not be rotating at the same rate .    an important advance in understanding",
    "s2b galaxies came from the development by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ms00 ) of the formalism necessary for studying their orbits .",
    "they introduced the concept of loops , families of orbits in which particles return to the same curve , but not the same position , after the two bars return to the same relative orientation .",
    "ms00 considered two models assuming that the b2 is more rapidly rotating than the b1 : the b2 in their model 1 ended near its corotation radius , while in their model 2 it ended well inside this radius .",
    "ms00 were unable to find loop orbits supporting the outer parts of the b2 in model 1 but succeeded in doing so in the more slowly rotating model 2 .",
    "using hydrodynamical simulations of such slowly rotating rigid b2s @xcite found them to be inefficient at driving gas to small radii .",
    "such models are not fully self - consistent since , in general , nested bars can not rotate rigidly through each other @xcite .",
    "in fact non - solid body rotation was hinted at by the loop orbit calculations of ms00 .",
    "@xmath0-body simulations provide one route to more self - consistent models of s2bs , but until now there existed a paucity of such models .",
    "most numerical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) required gas to form b2s ; for example , @xcite formed them via viscosity - driven instabilities in nuclear gas rings , which lead to b2s rotating slower than b1s .",
    "but the presence of b2s in a large fraction of gas - poor early - type galaxies @xcite indicates that b2s are not an exclusively gas dynamical phenomenon .",
    "counter - rotation in stellar disks can lead to decoupled counter - rotating bars @xcite , but such counter - rotation is infrequent @xcite . only rautiainen and collaborators @xcite have succeeded in forming long - lived b2s rotating in the same sense as the b1 in purely collisionless studies .",
    "the mechanism by which the b2s formed in these however simulations remains unclear .    in light of the increasing evidence that smbh feedback may play an important role in galaxy formation @xcite and the possibility that s2bs may provoke agns",
    ", the paucity of self - consistent @xmath0-body models of s2bs is a major hindrance to further theoretical development .",
    "the time is ripe , therefore , to examine whether unambiguous and independently rotating nested bars can form in high resolution collisionless simulations .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a nuclear bar constitutes strong evidence of a pseudo - bulge , i.e. , a bulge with a disky character .",
    "such pseudo - bulges form through the secular evolution of disks , via both gas and stellar dynamical processes ( see the review of * ? ? ?",
    "one of the main characteristics of pseudo - bulges is that they rotate rapidly , a property which favors them to become bar unstable . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate that a rapidly rotating bulge can develop a long - lived b2 in collisionless @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we focus on two examples of simulations which formed long - lasting double - barred systems taken from a large survey of such simulations .",
    "our high - resolution simulations consist of live disk and bulge components in a rigid halo potential .",
    "we restrict ourselves to rigid halos to afford high mass resolution in the nuclear regions , to study the complicated co - evolution of the two bars without the additional evolution introduced by the halo , and to compare with the models of ms00 .",
    "we defer the study of s2b systems in live halos to a future publication .",
    "the rigid halos used in this study are all logarithmic potentials @xmath1 .",
    "we set @xmath2 in both runs and @xmath3 in run 1 and @xmath4 in run 2 . both initial disks in our simulations have exponential surface densities with scale - length @xmath5 , mass @xmath6 and toomre-@xmath7 .",
    "the bulge was generated using the method of @xcite as described in @xcite , where a distribution function is integrated iteratively in the global potential , until convergence . in both cases",
    "the bulge has mass @xmath8 and we used an isotropic king model distribution function .",
    "the bulge truncation radius is @xmath9 in run 1 and @xmath10 in run 2 .",
    "the bulge set up this way is non - rotating .",
    "we introduce bulge rotation by simply reversing the velocities of bulge particles with negative angular momenta , which is still a valid solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "the bulge in run 1 is flattened by the disk potential to an edge - on projected ellipticity of @xmath11 . the ratio @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the peak velocity and @xmath14 is the average velocity dispersion inside the half mass radius . in run 2 ,",
    "the corresponding values are @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the kinematic values relative to the oblate isotropic rotators are @xmath17 for run 1 and @xmath18 for run 2 .",
    "thus both pseudo - bulges are above or close to the locus of oblate isotropic rotators .",
    "these pseudo - bulges are less tangentially biased and more pressure supported than rotationally - supported pseudo - bulges which would form out of gas driven to small radii . our simulations therefore probably under - estimate the tendency for pseudo - bulges to form nuclear bars .",
    "we use @xmath5 and @xmath6 as the units of length and mass , respectively , and the time unit is @xmath19 . if we scale these units to the physical values @xmath20 and @xmath21 kpc , then a unit of time is @xmath22 myr .",
    "we use a force resolution ( softening ) of @xmath23 , which scaled to the above physical units corresponds to 25 pc .",
    "both models had @xmath24 equal mass particles , with @xmath25 in the disk .",
    "these simulations were evolved with a 3-d cylindrical polar grid code @xcite .",
    "this code expands the potential in a fourier series in the cylindrical polar angle @xmath26 ; we truncated the expansion at @xmath27 .",
    "forces in the radial direction are solved for by direct convolution with the greens function while the vertical forces are obtained by fast fourier transform .",
    "we used grids measuring @xmath28 .",
    "the vertical spacing of the grid planes was @xmath29 .",
    "time integration used a leapfrog integrator with a fixed time - step @xmath30 .",
    "figure  [ fig : snapshots ] gives a general view of the evolution of run 1 over 750 time units ( @xmath31 gyr in our standard scaling ) .",
    "a nuclear bar forms rapidly ( before @xmath32 ) , as the dynamical times in the inner galaxy are much shorter than in the outer part .",
    "the pattern speed , , of this nuclear bar is large at this stage , and it extends to nearly its corotation radius , , indicating that it forms by the usual bar instability @xcite .",
    "the b1 forms at a later stage , between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the evolution of the amplitudes of the b1 and b2 ( and respectively ) , defined as the fourier @xmath35 amplitude over the radial ranges @xmath36 and @xmath37 , is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : barampl ] .",
    "the b2 is strong initially , but it weakens once the b1 forms . at the same time @xmath38 also decreases and ,",
    "since its semi - major axis does not change substantially , it no longer extends to .",
    "the transition to a stable s2b state is accomplished during a seemingly chaotic period during which both bars undergo phases when they are rather weak .",
    "after @xmath39 , however , the b2 settles into an oscillatory steady state with exhibiting regular oscillations .",
    "the double - barred state persists to the end of the simulation , lasting for @xmath40 gyr .",
    "the b2 shows up in both the disk and bulge particles .",
    "the b2 is stronger when the bars are perpendicular , and weaker when they are parallel to each other ( figure [ fig : barampl ] ) .",
    "note that this behavior is exactly opposite to the variations of gaseous rings in @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the primary bar instead varies in the opposite sense with respect to the relative phase of the two bars , although the amplitude of this oscillation is smaller . also decreases slowly after @xmath39 , possibly because orbits supporting the b1 are gradually disrupted by the relatively strong inner bar . as a consequence , the oscillations in decrease as the b1 weakens .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : barampl ] shows the evolution of and in run 2 .",
    "the main difference between run 2 and run 1 is that the initial bulge is larger in run 2 , allowing the b2 to dominate the global dynamics . as a result",
    ", the b1 oscillates more strongly than the b2 .",
    "this probably represents an extreme case of the dynamical influence of a b2 on a b1 .    the long - lived b2 rotates faster than the b1 : between @xmath41 and @xmath42 the average rotation period of the b2 in run 1 is about @xmath43 , and for the b1 @xmath44 .",
    "the pattern speed of the b2 , , also varies with the relative phase of the two bars : it is larger when the two bars align , and smaller when they are orthogonal .",
    "we plot in figure [ fig : crframe ] the system in the corotating frame of the b1 .",
    "the variations of both and are readily visible . the variation of  can be @xmath45 but is much less significant for ( figure [ fig : barphase ] ) . defining @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) as the average pattern speed of the b2 ( b1 ) over one relative rotation , we plot in the inset of figure [ fig : barphase ] the phase difference between @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) and the phase of the b2 ( b1 ) .",
    "the b1 is seen to rotate with a rather constant  but the b2 experiences a large variation in over one relative rotation .",
    "figure [ fig : ellipsefit ] presents ellipse fits using iraf for times when the b2 and b1 are perpendicular and at @xmath50 to each other . in both cases the phase of the b2 is constant to within @xmath51 and there is little sense of spirality in it .",
    "this is distinctly a nuclear bar rather than a nuclear spiral .",
    "we measured the sizes of the two bars , for two different relative orientations at @xmath52 and at @xmath53 , as the larger radius where the bar phase deviates by more than @xmath51 from a constant value .",
    "we find a semi - major axis ratio @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) at @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , in good agreement with the typical size ratio of local s2b systems @xcite .",
    "our self - consistent simulations of s2b systems can be compared to the models of ms00 .",
    "the simulations all exhibited oscillating pattern speeds and amplitudes for one or both bars .",
    "similarly ms00 found that the @xmath56 loops supporting the b2 change axis ratios and lead or trail the rigid figure of the b2 , as the bars rotate .",
    "the loop orbits of ms00 were more elongated in the b2 region when the two bars were orthogonal than when they were parallel .",
    "the pulsating character of the self - consistent b2 in the simulations provides strong evidence that @xmath56 loops are the backbone of the double bars in these simulations .",
    "this behavior is also in good agreement with the earlier prediction by @xcite that independent rigid rotation of two bars is not possible .",
    "the @xmath56 loop orbits of ms00 also suggested that would be largest when the two bars are parallel , which is also borne out by the simulations .",
    "furthermore , ms00 were unable to find supporting @xmath56 orbits when the b2 extended to about , while we found that had to decrease once the b1 formed and the b2 did not extend to , again in good agreement with ms00 .",
    "our simulations also suggest that observationally there should be a slight excess of close - to - perpendicular double bars , as the secondary bar tends to rotate slower when two bars are perpendicular .",
    "the main objective of this work is to create s2b systems and show how the two bars form spontaneously , interact and evolve .",
    "our simulations all form b2s before they form b1s .",
    "however this is not a prediction of our model and it occurs only because , for simplicity , we introduced our rotating pseudo - bulge from @xmath57 .",
    "it is more likely that a pseudo - bulge would form after gas is driven to the center by a pre - existing b1 .",
    "our pseudo - bulges all had rotation ; b2s did not form in simulations without pseudo - bulge rotation ( these results will be presented elsewhere , but see for example * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , @xcite produced b2s even though their bulges were analytic .",
    "we are able to form well - resolved , long - lived b2s in purely collisionless @xmath0-body simulations . the nuclear bars are distinctly barred , not spiral , and reach to the center .",
    "these simulations demonstrate that b2s do not need to be gaseous .",
    "we confirm that pseudo - bulge rotation may be an important ingredient for the formation of double - barred galaxies @xcite .",
    "the required degree of rotation is modest and not greater than that associated with pseudo - bulges @xcite .",
    "the b2s in these simulations rotate faster than the b1s .",
    "the implications of the pulsating nature of b1s on central gas inflow are unclear at present .",
    "this new method for forming s2b models reliably and repeatedly should prove a boon to exploring their dynamics and evolution , their observational properties , their effect on gas , etc .",
