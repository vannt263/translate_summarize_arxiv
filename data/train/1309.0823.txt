    "brown dwarfs ( bds ) are an ubiquitous outcome of the star formation process .",
    "all young regions investigated so far with sufficient depth host a population of bds with masses down to 0.01@xmath2 or even below . the mechanism that governs their formation",
    ", however , remains unknown .",
    "it is clear that additional physics needs to be included in the models for the cloud fragmentation and subsequent evolution , to allow for the formation of a sizable number of bds @xcite .",
    "plausible options for these processes include fragmentation driven by turbulence , dynamical ejection of embryonic bds from multiple systems , fragmentation of filaments falling into a cluster potential , or fragmentation of protoplanetary disks , again combined with ejection @xcite .",
    "young brown dwarfs are a critical population to test the relevance of these processes .",
    "the standard diagnostic to distinguish between theoretical scenarios is the distribution of stellar and substellar masses after star formation is finished , or the initial mass function ( imf ) . in the literature several parameterisations for the imf are used , for example a series of power laws @xcite or a lognormal form @xcite . for our goal of determining the abundance of brown dwarfs ,",
    "an often used parameterisation of the imf is the star / bd ratio @xmath0 , the ratio of the number of objects in the two mass bins from 0.08 to 1.0@xmath2 and from 0.03 to 0.08@xmath2 , where the low mass cutoff as 0.03@xmath2 is chosen to assure completeness .",
    "the upper mass limit for the stars of 1.0@xmath2 is to some extent an arbitrary definition , but the relatively small number of higher - mass stars in the nearby star forming region assures that this particular choice does not affect the result much .",
    "the star / bd ratio as a metric has the advantage of maximising the sample size in the substellar regime and thus minimizing the statistical errors .",
    "because the stellar side of the imf is well - determined for the nearby star forming regions and shows , in the overwhelming majority of regions , no evidence for environmental differences , any variation in the star / bd ratio from one region to another would indicate a change in the bd abundance .    measuring the substellar mass function and the star /",
    "bd ratio is a challenging task .",
    "it needs a consistent survey procedure and a careful analysis of possible incompleteness , but the core problem is to estimate the masses .",
    "this requires one to make assumptions about the distance to and age of the region , as well as the extinction law used to deredden the photometry or spectra .",
    "furthermore , the conversion from observed quantities to masses can only be done in the framework of a given theoretical isochrone and thus depends on the status of the evolutionary models for young stars and brown dwarfs .    in previous work within the project sonyc ( substellar objects in nearby young clusters )",
    "we have presented tentative evidence for regional differences in the star / bd ratio .",
    "in particular , for the young cluster ngc1333 in the perseus star forming complex we find @xmath3 based on a very deep survey with comprehensive spectroscopic follow - up ( @xcite , hereafter sonyc - i ; @xcite , hereafter sonyc - iv ) . for other regions",
    "we and other groups have published r - values ranging from 2 to 8 ( see sonyc - iv ) .",
    "one of the most extreme cases in the literature is the cluster ic348 , the second embedded cluster in perseus and a slightly older sibling to ngc1333 @xcite , with a star / bd ratio of @xmath4 @xcite . at face value , this indicates changes in the bd abundance by a factor of 4 occuring within the same star forming association .",
    "so far , however , the uncertainties for the star / bd ratio have not been assessed accurately .",
    "the goal of this paper is to carry out a benchmark test for the two extreme cases ngc1333 and ic348 to verify their discrepant star / bd ratios .",
    "the core idea of this paper is to determine the mass distribution and the star / bd ratio for two young clusters in perseus and to assess the associated uncertainties",
    ". we will start with consistently selected samples for the two clusters , i.e. samples which have been put together in a homogeneous way , to minimize the influence of selection biases and incompleteness .",
    "for these samples , we will then define a consistent way of estimating object masses by comparing photometry with a given model isochrone .",
    "in addition to the choice of the isochrone , the distance to the cluster , the extinction law , and the age of the region enter as free parameters into this procedure .",
    "we will define a set of scenarios with plausible choices for these parameters and different isochrones .",
    "we will then estimate object masses and calculate the star / bd ratio and other indicators of the mass distribution for each of these scenarios .",
    "this will yield a useful dataset to discuss the uncertainties in these indicators and assess whether there is evidence for regional differences in the substellar imf between ngc1333 and ic348 .",
    "we use the spitzer - selected sample of young stellar / substellar objects presented by @xcite which includes our two target regions . for each of the regions , a region of @xmath5 centered on the core of the cluster was observed .",
    "the selection in @xcite is based on colours and magnitudes in spitzer and 2mass bands from 1 to 24@xmath6 .",
    "their multi - colour selection process uses a series of criteria designed to exclude background stars , non - stellar emission features and extragalactic objects . according to their analysis",
    ", this process yields only minimal contamination ( a few percent ) .",
    "an earlier version of this process was used in @xcite in a survey of ngc1333 .",
    "assuming that the distances to the clusters are similar , the identical selection procedure also ensures that the depth and completeness in terms of magnitudes in the two samples is comparable .",
    "this removes a major obstacle for an accurate comparison of the bd abundance .",
    "since the primary selection criterion is excess emission in the infrared , this sample only contains objects with emission from circumstellar material , i.e. either disks or envelopes .",
    "it does not include disk - less young stars and brown dwarfs ( class iii objects ) .",
    "therefore , to infer star / bd ratios , we have to make the assumption that the fraction of objects with disks does not change with object mass in the low - mass regime .",
    "as recently shown in @xcite , this is a plausible assumption for many star forming regions , including ic348 . for ngc1333 , there might be a slight mass dependence , as the disk fraction in the total spitzer - selected sample is found to be @xmath7% @xcite , whereas the value for the very low mass objects is only 55 - 66% ( sonyc - iv ) .",
    "this indicates that the star / bd ratio in this cluster could be slightly overestimated .",
    "the entire perseus cloud , including the two target clusters have also been observed as part of the spitzer legacy program from cores to disks ( c2d , pi : n. evans ) . their perseus yso catalogue derived from irac photometry",
    "is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we prefer to use the @xcite selection , because it is slightly deeper , which is beneficial for our purposes .",
    "the downside of the @xcite sample is the limited spatial coverage . here",
    "the c2d catalogue is useful to check the spatial completeness of our samples .     +    in fig .",
    "[ f0 ] we show the spatial distribution of the selected objects in ngc1333 and ic348 . with red squares we plot the samples from @xcite , with black crosses the c2d sample that covers the entire perseus region .",
    "the figure shows that the number of yso candidates outside the region covered by @xcite is small compared with the total population .",
    "this is particularly true for ngc1333 which shows a very compact profile and can be considered to be spatially complete ( see also sonyc - iv ) . for ic348",
    ", there is a tail of a yso population towards the south - west , which represents the transition region to another densely populated area in the perseus star forming region .",
    "in addition , there are about 10 objects outside the coverage of the @xcite survey . however , there is also a large number of additional yso candidates only contained in the c2d sample within the cluster core .",
    "we checked the objects only in c2d and found that they do not show an obvious magnitude or extinction bias with respect to the sample we are using , thus , even in case we are missing members in the outskirts of the cluster , this is not going to affect our analysis in any significant way . while @xcite do find a difference in the imf between the core and the halo in ic348 , both regions ( in their definitions ) are within the survey area of @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the samples we are using are not affected by a spatial bias .",
    "[ f0 ] also illustrates one major difference between ic348 and ngc1333 .",
    "the core of ic348 has about twice the diameter of the core of ngc1333 ( 2.1 vs. 1.2pc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. the cluster volume in ic348 is about 8 times larger than in ngc1333 . on the other hand",
    ", ic348 has only about 20% more ysos than ngc1333 , according to the spitzer surveys @xcite .",
    "the fraction of diskless class iii objects is higher in ic348 , taken that into account the total the yso population in ic348 could be up to twice as large as in ngc1333 .",
    "this still implies that the object density in ngc1333 is 4 - 7 times higher than in ngc1333 .",
    "given the age , size , and number of members in these clusters , this difference is likely to be primordial , and not caused by dynamical evolution ( see fig . 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "hence , these two clusters constitute an excellent test case to probe the effects of dynamical interactions and cluster potential on the formation of bds .      for the overwhelming majority of young objects , masses can only be estimated indirectly by comparing an observed quantity with predictions from theoretical isochrones for a given age .",
    "for the observed quantity , there are two options , either the effective temperature or the luminosity ( or a photometric proxy ) .",
    "the luminosity has the problem that model derivations are sensitive to the age for pre - main sequence objects that are still contracting .",
    "in addition , measurements can be affected by extinction as well as excess emission from disk and/or accretion .",
    "the effective temperature is problematic for other reasons ; it depends on atmosphere models and can be altered by magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "this can lead us to underestimate object masses by up to a factor of two .    for our chosen samples ,",
    "accurate multi - band photometry is available , while the spectroscopic follow - up is not complete .",
    "therefore , we will rely on photometry in the optical and near - infrared to estimate masses .",
    "we complement the 2mass photometry provided by @xcite with optical photometry from @xcite and @xcite for ic348 ( landolt r- and i - band ) and from sonyc - i for ngc1333 ( sloan i- and z - band ) .",
    "for some objects without 2mass near - infrared magnitudes , we were able to complement the dataset using the photometry from @xcite for ic348 and sonyc - i for ngc1333 . in total , the samples contain 142 ( for ic348 ) and 95 ( for ngc1333 ) objects with photometry in jhk , with smaller subsets of 86 ( ic348 ) and 23 ( ngc1333 ) with additional optical magnitudes available .    for the objects with 2mass photometry , we also obtain the error as listed in the database ( mostly between 0.03 and 0.05mag ) .",
    "similarly , the photometry from @xcite provides errors for all measurements . for the remaining photometry , errors for individual objects",
    "are not reported in the literature .",
    "for the optical magnitudes in ic348 , we adopt a generic and conservative uncertainty of 0.1mag . for the sonyc magnitudes in ngc1333",
    ", we adopt errors of 0.1mag for the optical bands and 0.05mag for the near - infrared bands .    based on the information given in the papers listed above , the error values adopted for",
    "the optical photometry should be typical for the samples .",
    "however , some objects might be affected by additional uncertainties introduced to calibration imperfections .",
    "since the z- and i - bands are located at the long - wavelength edge of the sensitivity of the optical ccds , they are highly susceptible to colour terms in the calibration , which are difficult to measure with the usual photometric standard stars .",
    "this can introduce errors larger than 0.1mag in individual sources , which can not be quantified accurately .",
    "this issue is a particular problem for very red sources , since most of their optical flux is emitted in the part of the spectrum where the ccd sensitivity declines .",
    "we derive masses using three different sets of isochrones from the lyon group , bt - settl ( with agss2009 opacities ) , bt - dusty ( with agss2009 opacities ) , and bt - nextgen ( with gnc93 opacities ) .",
    "the latter two are updated versions from the standard ames - dusty and nextgen models .",
    "the main difference between the three sets is the treatment of dust .",
    "in contrast to nextgen , dusty includes dust opacities .",
    "settl includes a full dust cloud model . for more information on the isochrones ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "note that atmospheric dust becomes a major source of opacity for @xmath8k @xcite , corresponding to @xmath9 for young brown dwarfs , which is the low - mass limit in our analysis , thus , the treatment of dust should not have a major effect on our results .",
    "the isochrones predict absolute magnitudes as a function of object mass in all photometric bands for which observations are available .",
    "they cover the range from 0.02@xmath2 or below to 1.4@xmath10 and are available for ages starting from 1myr , which is adequate for our purposes .    to compare the observed with the predicted magnitudes , we first shift the isochrones from absolute magnitude to the distance of our target regions , which enters here as a free parameter ( see sect .",
    "[ s23 ] ) .",
    "we also re - bin the isochrones to a uniform stepsize of 0.01@xmath2 , using a linear interpolation over a small portion of the isochrone .",
    "we then calculate a series of reddened isochrones for @xmath11mag in steps of 1mag . for this step ,",
    "the choice of the extinction law is important ( see sect . [ s23 ] ) .",
    "the upper limit is chosen to be 20mag , for two reasons .",
    "first , independent studies indicate that only a small fraction in the perseus star forming complex exceeds this extinction value .",
    "second , beyond this value the samples are biased towards bright sources , thus , incompleteness becomes an issue .    after these preparations , the best fit for mass and @xmath12 is determined with a @xmath13 minimization .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom in this process is the number of photometric bands for which data is available ( @xmath14 to @xmath15 ) minus the number of free parameters ( mass and @xmath12 , i.e. 2 ) . for each object",
    ", we saved the combination of mass and @xmath12 that results in the minimum value for @xmath13 , the corresponding reduced @xmath13 ( @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath13 divided by the number of degrees of freedom ) and the number of available bands @xmath17 .",
    "objects with best fit value of @xmath18 are discarded from the analysis  since this is the upper limit in our grid of isochrones , their mass estimate is not reliable .",
    "a typical example of the resulting @xmath16 plotted vs. the best mass estimate is shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , left panel .",
    "this figure reveals that the procedure produces similar fitting results for high- and low - mass objects and for objects with and without optical photometry .",
    "we also show a typical @xmath12 vs. mass plot from this procedure ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , right panel ) .",
    "the upper limit in @xmath12 is not changing significantly with mass , i.e. there is no evidence for an extinction bias in these samples ( apart from the @xmath19 cutoff ) .",
    "the distribution of reduced @xmath13 can in principle be used to assess the goodness - of fit for our mass estimates . for a good fit",
    ", we expect @xmath16 to have an average of 1.0 and a standard deviation of @xmath20 . however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , our procedure yields significantly higher values in @xmath16 .",
    "this indicates that either the model does not reflect the data well or that the errors are underestimated . in our case , the high values for @xmath16 are mostly explained by the fact that our model is discretely sampled in mass-@xmath12 space .",
    "the stepsize in mass and @xmath12 results in magnitude steps that are often larger than the typical photometric error .",
    "in addition , in some cases the errors of the optical photometry may be underestimated , see above .",
    "therefore , we only use the procedure to select the best fit solution .      in our estimation of masses from photometry , the distance , age , as well as the extinction law , expressed in the quantity @xmath21 ,",
    "are considered free parameters .",
    "in addition , we have to choose the theoretical isochrone .",
    "what we call scenarios in the following are combinations of isochrone , distance , age , and extinction law for which we estimate masses .",
    "these scenarios have been chosen to cover the plausible range of these parameters and to give insight into the impact of the specific choice of a parameter or an isochrone on the mass estimates . in the following ,",
    "we justify the choice of the range of the parameters .    for the extinction , we use the parameterised law by @xcite , with @xmath22 , the canonical value used for the ism . this law yields extinction offsets that are consistent with the often - used extinction values published by @xcite . in reality , @xmath23 depends on the grain properties and is not the same for every line of sight ; @xcite report values ranging from 2.6 to 5.6 , with the overwhelming majority ( 22 out of 27 cases ) below 4.5 .",
    "we therefore use @xmath24 as an alternative value to be able to assess the impact of the choice of @xmath23 on the mass estimates .",
    "the distances to the two clusters are not well constrained .",
    "the entire perseus cloud is usually assumed to have an average distance of @xmath25pc , which we use as a default value .",
    "based on the hipparcos parallaxes for the early - type stars @xcite estimate @xmath26pc for the cloud .",
    "based on a kinematical analysis of a much larger sample of a stars , infer 300pc ( 270 - 330pc ) . however , there are indications that ngc1333 is located at a shorter distance .",
    "@xcite report a distance of 235pc for ngc1333 based on interferometry of the maser emission from a source that may be associated with the cluster .",
    "this is also consistent with an earlier photometric estimate of the distance of ngc1333 ( 220pc ) by .",
    "in addition , suggest , based on extinction map analysis , that the northern part of the perseus region ( where ic348 is located ) is slightly more distant than the southern part ( where ngc1333 is located ) . to take this into account",
    ", we use a distance of 230pc as an alternative value , noting that this is only a viable option for ngc1333 .",
    "the ages that are typically quoted are 2 - 4myr for ic348 and 1 - 3myr for ngc1333 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "judging from model - independent indicators of evolutionary state ( fraction of objects with disks , fraction of objects in class i stage , luminosity function ) , ngc1333 is definitely younger than ic348 , and both are clearly younger than star forming regions with established ages of 5 - 10myr like upper scorpius and the tw hydrae association ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the context of our study ,",
    "the relevant quantity is not the age of the cluster , but the average age of the objects contained in our samples , which may not include the youngest , embedded population because we require a near - infrared detection . in fact , we showed in sonyc - iv that most of the very low mass objects in ngc1333 are consistent with an age of 1 - 5myr , based on their position in the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "therefore , we use a default value of 3myr , which is plausible for both clusters . to assess the influence of the age on the mass estimates , we additionally estimate masses for an age of 1myr .    to evaluate the impact of the choice of the parameters , we define 6 scenarios for which we estimate object masses .",
    "these scenarios are listed in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the default scenario # 1 uses a distance of 300pc , an age of 3myr , @xmath23 of 3.1 , and the bt - settl model , which has the most recent opacities and the most advanced treatment of dust . in scenarios # 2 to # 4",
    "we vary the cluster parameters .",

    "2 ) models : * masses are only defined in relation to evolutionary models , and at young ages the deficiencies of the available tracks are well documented . however , at the moment no tracks with self - consistent treatment of the collapse and infall are available to the community .",
    "based on a dynamical mass estimate for the very low mass pre - main sequence object ab dor c , which is older than our target regions , @xcite claim that the existing mass - luminosity relations underestimate masses by a factor of about two for young objects , but this claim has been questioned @xcite . at young ages and very low masses ,",

    "3 ) cluster parameters : * as discussed in sect .",
    "[ s22 ] , several properties of the clusters affect the mass estimates , in particular the distance , the age , and the extinction law . from our set of scenarios documented in table [ t1 ] ( scenarios 1 - 4 ) we can assess how the uncertainties in these parameters propagate through the procedure . in general , changes in age and distance cause significant changes in the estimated mass distribution , while a change in the extinction does not . for ngc1333 , the induced variations in the star / bd ratios are small ; @xmath0 varies from 2.0 to 2.4 , smaller than the statistical uncertainties . for ic348 ,",
    "the scatter is larger , from 1.9 to 3.6 , but excluding the implausible scenarios with age of 1myr and distance of 230pc this range shrinks to 3.2 - 3.6 .",

    "for example , for ic348 and an ( unlikely ) age of 5myr we obtain @xmath34 .",
    "this is easy to understand  as the objects evolve , they become fainter i.e. the same magnitude corresponds to a larger mass . as a result ,",
    "objects move from the substellar to the stellar domain , and the star / bd ratio increases .",

    "however , in terms of object masses the depth of the survey depends on the assumed distance and age .",
    "assuming a shorter distance , as well as a younger age , will produce lower masses for the same magnitudes , i.e. the entire mass distribution would be shifted to lower masses , including the limits for completeness . for our default scenario with age of 3myr and distance of 300pc , the magnitude limit of the samples",
    "correponds to @xmath35 .",

    "the alternative age of 1myr ( scenario # 2 ) yields a new mass limit of 0.012 - 0.015@xmath2 .",
    "thus , in these scenarios we would be sensitive to slightly lower mass objects , but since the object density is very low in this mass domain , this has only a minuscule effect on the mass distibution .",

    "however , the mass distribution in ic348 gives almost exactly the same knee when assuming an age of 1myr ( upper left panel in fig .",
    "this effect is best explained by the knee in the mass - luminosity relation at this age , which is predicted to become weaker with age .",

    "+    in summary , his comparison shows that the choice of the cluster parameters and the choice of the isochrone can have noticable effects on the estimated distribution of object masses .",
    "we find that there could be significant differences in the mass distributions between the two clusters , if ngc1333 is at a shorter distance than ic348 . in this case",

    "see table [ t1 ] for the results . for the cluster ngc1333 ,",
    "our 6 scenarios give star / bd ratios of 1.9 - 2.4 , which is a range comparable to the statistical uncertainties ( see sect .",
    "[ s33 ] ) .",
    "this means that our previous estimate for this cluster from sonyc - iv ( @xmath44 ) is confirmed .    for ic348",
    ", we find a wider range of values between 1.9 and 4.0 .",
    "these values imply that star / bd ratios reported in the literature for ic348 of @xmath45 @xcite are overestimated .",
    "a possible reason for these large values is survey incompleteness or low number statistics .",
    "as explained in sect .",
    "[ s33 ] , the star / bd ratio depends on age , therefore these large star / bd ratios in the literature would become viable if ic348 is in fact significantly older than 3myr .",
    "this is unlikely , as age - dependent observable quantities like the disk fraction are comparable to other 2 - 3myr old clusters @xcite .    for ic348 an age of 1myr and a distance of 230pc",
    "are not plausible ( sect .",
    "[ s23 ] ) . excluding the scenarios using these parameters",
    "gives a range for @xmath0 between 2.9 and 4.0 , which is our best estimate for this cluster .",
    "these values are somewhat larger than in ngc1333 , although still within the margin of error . for example ,",
    "for the default case the star / bd ratio is 3.6 for ic348 with a lower limit of 2.6 , and 2.2 for ngc1333 with an upper limit of 2.5 .",
    "this is before taking into account the statistical uncertainties .",
    "thus , based on the star / bd ratio the evidence for regional differences in the mass distribution of ic348 and ngc1333 is tentative .      in table",
    "[ t1 ] we also report two other quantities that are used in the literature to describe the imf .",
    "the power - law slope of the mass function @xmath29 is directly determined from the star / bd ratio and thus reflects the same trends reported in sect .",
    "[ s34 ] . for ngc1333",
    ", @xmath29 is 0.9 - 1.0 ; for ic349 0.7 - 1.0 , or 0.7 - 0.8 after excluding the implausible scenarios .",
    "note that the slope is an average value for the mass range 0.03 to 1.0@xmath2 ; therefore it is not unexpected to find values somewhere between the tyipcal slope of 1.3 in the regime of low - mass stars @xcite and the typical value of @xmath46 in the very low mass regime ( see sonyc - iv ) .",
    "independent from the star / bd ratio , we determine the median mass for each scenario .",
    "these values vary between 0.13 and 0.30@xmath2 , again indicating that the choice of the cluster parameters and the choice of the isochrone affect the results considerably . for a given scenario ,",
    "the two clusters have very similar median masses ( maximum difference is 0.04@xmath2 for scenario 4 ) . increasing age and distance will also increase the median mass .",
    "note that have recently determined the mass function for ic348 from a different survey and find a characteristic mass ( in the lognormal mass function ) of 0.21 - 0.22@xmath2 consistent with the values derived here .",
    "in sect . [ s3 ] we established that differences in the mass distributions of the two clusters are significant , if ngc1333 is closer than ic348 . in addition , there is tentative evidence that the star / bd ratio in ic348 is slightly larger than in ngc1333 . given that our two target regions differ in object density by a factor of 4 - 7 ( sect .",
    "[ s22 ] ) , this finding can in principle be used to put constraints on theories for bd formation in which the stellar density is a critical parameter for the yield .",
    "one popular scenario to form bds is as part of dynamical cluster formation . here",
    ", very low mass objects are removed from their accretion reservoir by dynamical ejections and thus stop their growth ; the final mass is set by the competition between accretion and ejection @xcite . in this model the efficiency of bd formation is partly controlled by the likelihood for dynamical encounters which is related to the object density .",
    "the most recent radiation - hydrodynamical simulations by bate ( see their table 1 ) are comparable to the clusters studied here in terms of initial cloud mass and number of objects produced .",
    "the simulations yield star / bd ratios ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) and median masses ( 0.21 , 0.24@xmath2 ) that are consistent with our empirical results . however , the impact of object density is difficult to judge , since the simulations have only been carried out for a very limited set of initial conditions .",
    "another way to form bds that has been suggested in the literature is gravitational fragmentation of infalling gas into a stellar cluster @xcite . here",
    "the potential well , and thus the object density in the cluster , is a critical parameter for the efficiency of bd formation .",
    "the bds and very low mass objects are expected to be formed preferentially in regions with high stellar density .",
    "qualitatively the predictions from this scenario are confirmed by our analysis : under plausible assumptions , the denser cluster ngc1333 has indeed a larger fraction of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs ( see sect .",
    "[ s34 ] ) .",
    "their figure 7 shows the bd fraction as a function of object density from their simulations .",
    "the two regions investigated in the current paper are both at the low end of the considered densities ( 1 - 100pc@xmath49 ) . for these densities ,",
    "the predicted bd fractions are between 7 and 13% . in their paper the bd fraction is calculated as the number of bds divided by the total number of objects . from our mass distributions , this quantity is @xmath50% in ic348 and @xmath51% in ngc1333 , i.e. the predicted values are lower than the observed one .",
    "if this formation mechanism plays a role and the predictions are realistic , it could only contribute about one third to half of the bds in the clusters . other mechanisms , for example disk fragmentation followed by the ejection of embryonic or proto - brown dwarfs @xcite , could contribute to the final tally of substellar objects in the young clusters",
    ".    judged by their figure 7 , an increase in the object density by one order of magnitudes would result in an increase in the bd fraction by a factor of about 2 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed difference between ic348 and ngc1333 , although such a difference is , as explained in sect .",
    "[ s34 ] , still within the uncertainties .",
    "therefore , the scenario remains viable , but can not be rigorously verified with the current surveys .",
    "an important test for the theory would be the measurement of the bd fraction in a cluster that is significantly denser than ngc1333 , such as rcw38 @xcite or the orion nebula cluster .",
    "so far , the survey results in the onc give inconsistent answers regarding the frequency of very low mass objects .    the aforementioned scenario for brown dwarf formation via disk fragmentation could also result in a star / bd ratio that depends on stellar density , if some of the fragmentation processes are driven by stellar encounters @xcite or disk - disk collisions @xcite .",
    "stellar encounters could also facilitate the ejection of bound brown dwarf companions from their host stars . with these additional mechanisms",
    ", disk fragmentation models would again produce more brown dwarfs in a region with higher stellar density , which is qualitatively what we find to be the case .",
    "however , the expected magnitude of this effect has not been estimated yet .    as pointed out in sect .",
    "[ s21 ] , the current stellar densities in ic348 and ngc1333 are probably representative of their primordial densities @xcite .",
    "with constant star formation rate , these should scale with the gas density in the original cloud . under these assumptions ,",
    "we can also put limits on scenarios for brown dwarf formation through turbulent fragmentation . according to the model presented by @xcite ,",
    "a factor of 5 in density enhancement should amount to a very large increase ( about an order of magnitude , see their fig .",
    "1 ) in the number of brown dwarfs . in the gravoturbulent picture @xcite",
    "the effect seems to be similar .",
    "qualitatively the result is as seen in the perseus clusters ( i.e. the denser cluster produces more brown dwarfs ) , but the magnitude of the effect is much larger than what we derive .",
    "however , differences in other cluster parameters , for example in the mach number , could partially erase the predicted effect .",
    "since their predictions depend heavily on initial conditions , it is doubtful whether empirically derived imfs can provide a meaningful test for these models .",
    "an important caveat in our analysis is the fact that what we derive is a snapshot of the mass distribution , which may not necessarily represent the imf .",
    "this is particularly relevant because ngc1333 is at an earlier evolutionary state than ic348 and might become as rich as its sibling at the other side of the perseus star forming complex @xcite . in the typical picture of cluster formation , however , lower mass objects form later ( e.g. * ? ? ? * their fig .",
    "8) , thus , if additional formation processes in ngc1333 have any effect on the mass distribution , they are expected to amplify the observed discrepancy with ic348 . for the comparison with the models quoted above , which typically only predict a mass distribution of cores , not an imf ,",
    "this issue is not of practical relevance .",
    "we present a systematic study of the mass distribution in the two young open clusters ic348 and ngc1333 , with specific emphasis on the substellar regime .",
    "these two regions are of specific interest because ngc1333 has a higher spatial density ( by a factor of 4 - 7 ) . in the following we list our most important findings .    1 .   the mass distribution as well as the parameters derived from it , e.g. , the star / bd ratio @xmath0 or the median mass , is significantly affected by the choice of the isochrone used to estimated masses and the choice of the cluster parameters .",
    "therefore , we caution against comparing imf parameters derived using different assumptions .",
    "if ngc1333 is in fact closer to the sun than ic348 , as indicated by several independent studies , there is a significant difference in the mass distributions of these two clusters , in the sense that ngc1333 harbours a larger fraction of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "the star / bd ratio in ngc1333 is 1.9 - 2.4 in ngc1333 , consistent with previous estimates , and 2.9 - 4.0 in ic348 , significantly lower than in previous estimates .",
    "the combined uncertainty in these values is approximately @xmath36 , but can be lowered with more accurate distance estimates and age estimates .",
    "if confirmed , these values would point to a larger fraction of brown dwarfs in ngc1333 .",
    "these results ( 2 and 3 ) indicate that the relative number of very low mass objects in a star forming regions may depend on the stellar density , in the sense that regions with higher density ( such as ngc1333 ) produce more very low mass objects . at this point , this conclusion is only based on two clusters and needs to be verified in other regions .",
