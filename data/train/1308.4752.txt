    "the majorana fermions were predicted to emerge as the edge quasi - particle excitations of the topological superconductors  @xcite .",

    "@xcite proposed a method for detecting the majorana bound states in topological superconductors by the effect of the resonant andreev reflection across a junction between a normal metal and a topological superconductor , which contributes a quantized conductance of @xmath5 .",
    "recent experimental results  @xcite are qualitatively consistent with the existence of majorana bound states in these systems .",

    "<S> we study the transport through the kitaev chain with incommensurate potentials coupled to two normal leads by the numerical operator method . </S>",
    "<S> we find a quantized linear conductance of @xmath0 , which is independent to the disorder strength and the gate voltage in a wide range , signaling the majorana bound states . while the incommensurate disorder suppresses the current at finite voltage bias , and then narrows the linear response regime of the @xmath1 curve which exhibits two plateaus corresponding to the superconducting gap and the band edge respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the linear conductance abruptly drops to zero as the disorder strength reaches the critical value @xmath2 with @xmath3 the p - wave pairing amplitude and @xmath4 the hopping between neighbor sites , corresponding to the transition from the topological superconducting phase to the anderson localized phase . </S>",
    "<S> changing the gate voltage also causes an abrupt drop of the linear conductance by driving the chain into the topologically trivial superconducting phase , whose @xmath1 curve exhibits an exponential shape . </S>"
