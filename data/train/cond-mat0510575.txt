    "rare earth pyrochlore magnets r@xmath0m@xmath0o@xmath1 ( r  rare earth ion , m  transition metal ) have attracted recently a lot of attention due to the specific geometry of exchange bonds .",
    "rare earth ions in a pyrochlore structure form a network of corner - sharing tetrahedra .",
    "the nearest - neighbors antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange interaction is strongly frustrated in this lattice ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and the classical ground state of this system should remain macroscopically degenerate down to t=0 .",
    "selection of a unique ground state in the real magnets should occur due to other interactions like further neighbor exchange interactions , dipole interactions , single - ion anisotropy or due to the lifting of degeneracy by fluctuations .",
    "single - ion anisotropy is known to have a strong effect on the formation of the ground state : strong axial anisotropy favors an unusual spin - ice state in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite while in the case of a strong easy - plane anisotropy in er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 a nel state is formed by the quantum order - by - disorder mechanism @xcite .",
    "gd - based pyrochlore magnets gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and gd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 were considered to be real examples of an af heisenberg pyrochlore .",
    "both compounds demonstrate a magnetic ordering at a temperature near 1k , but their spin structures are quite different . in the case of gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , two successive transitions are observed at 1.02k and 0.74k @xcite .",
    "the low - temperature magnetic structure is a complicated noncollinear multiple-@xmath3 structure @xcite . in the case of gd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "a unique phase transition is observed @xcite and the magnetic structure is a non - collinear with @xmath4 @xcite .    up to now",
    ", single - ion anisotropy effects were not considered for these compounds since the gd@xmath5 ion is an s - state ion with @xmath6=0 @xcite . however , a considerable anisotropy was found in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a crystal field splitting of the ionic levels occurs because of a strong spin - orbit coupling among @xmath7-electrons , which breaks the simple @xmath8-scheme of the energy levels and leads to the admixture of the @xmath9 states into the ground state of the gd@xmath5 ion .",
    "the main anisotropy constant @xmath10 was found to be equal to 74mk in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , which makes the overall crystal field splitting @xmath112.7k comparable with the exchange energy @xmath123.7k .",
    "thus , it is important to determine the values of the single - ion anisotropy constants in gd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 as well .",
    "a difference in the single - ion anisotropy could be important for understanding the above mentioned difference of the magnetic ground states in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and gd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 .    to study single - ion effects",
    ", we used the non - magnetic isostructural compound y@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 with a small amount ( nominally 0.5% ) of gadolinium substituting for yttrium .",
    "this enables one to determine the single ion anisotropy parameters since magnetic ions are in the same surrounding @xcite as in the concentrated magnet .",
    "we found the presence of a single - ion anisotropy , evidenced by the obvious splitting of the esr absorption spectrum , and we determined the values of the main anisotropy constants .",
    "polycrystalline samples of ( y@xmath13gd@xmath14)@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 were prepared by heating a stoichiometric mixture of y@xmath0o@xmath15 ( 99.99% ) , gd@xmath0o@xmath15 ( 99.999% ) and sno@xmath0 ( 99.9% ) in air .",
    "the samples were heated between 1400@xmath16c and 1450@xmath16c for several hours with intermediate regrindings .",
    "the x - ray diffraction pattern obtained at room temperature with a bruker d8 diffractometer corresponds to the pure phase with a small amount ( @xmath171% ) of sno@xmath0 .",
    "a magnetic susceptibility curve was measured with a field of 80oe in the temperature range 20k-250k .",
    "sample magnetization corresponds to the curie law with the effective moment of 7.9@xmath18 per gd@xmath5 ion , assuming the nominal gd concentration of 0.5% .",
    "the esr study was performed at frequencies 18 - 100ghz using a set of home - made transmission - type esr spectrometers equipped with a he - cooled cryomagnet .",
    "the esr absorption spectra were recorded as field dependences of the transmitted microwave signal .",
    "electron spin resonance is a sensitive method for the determination of the spin - hamiltonian constants ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the microwave absorption power per spin is :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the microwave field of the frequency @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the energies of the corresponding spin states , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    the microwave field is polarized perpendicular to the external magnetic field in our experiments .",
    "thus , only dipolar transitions with @xmath26 are observed ( @xmath27 is the spin projection onto the magnetic field direction ) . in the absence of single - ion anisotropy",
    ", a single resonance line should be observed at the resonance frequency @xmath28 .",
    "the presence of a single - ion anisotropy results in a multi - component absorption spectrum .",
    "the amplitudes and the signs of the spin - hamiltonian parameters may be determined from the positions and the relative intensities of these components .",
    "esr absorption spectra measured at different microwave frequencies and at different temperatures are shown in figures [ fig : lines - f ] , [ fig : lines - t ] .",
    "the absorption spectrum is clearly multi - component , which indicates the presence of crystal field splitting of the single - ion energy levels .",

    "the point symmetry of the gd ion surroundings is @xmath29 , and the main term in the anisotropy energy is the second order axial term with the anisotropy axis along the @xmath30 direction .",
    "measurements on the single crystals of the pyrochlore titanate have shown that this term is the most important @xcite . as a first step of the present analysis",
    ", we will consider a simplified model restricted to this term only :    @xmath31    treating the anisotropy term in the first order of perturbation theory , for the magnetic field applied at the angle @xmath32 with respect to the anisotropy axis @xmath33 , we obtain for the energies , up to a constant term :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the spin projection on the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the resonance field corresponding to the @xmath36 dipolar transition is    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is a free spin resonance field .",
    "when averaging over the orientation , grains with the anisotropy axis perpendicular to the field direction enter with the higher weight . for the case of a narrow resonance line ,",
    "this averaging yields :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the magnetic fields , at which the resonance absorption is observed , are limited by the values @xmath42 and @xmath43 , corresponding to grains with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "thus , the averaged esr absorption line corresponding to a given @xmath36 transition should demonstrate sharp edges both at the left and at the right of the paramagnetic resonance position . at the end corresponding to grains with @xmath44",
    "it should have a step - like edge , while at the other end ( @xmath46 grains ) , it should demonstrate a sharp increase of absorption corresponding to the square root divergency in . whether this increase in absorption is to the left or to the right from the free spin resonance position @xmath47 depends , for a given @xmath35 , on the sign of the @xmath2 constant only .",
    "we have studied the esr absorption at different temperatures ( see ) . at low temperatures , the contributions to the absorption arising from the states with a large negative @xmath35 ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 )",
    "dominate . in one",
    "can clearly see that an intense absorption at low temperatures occurs on the left edge of the esr spectra , while on the right edge there are several step - like features of smaller amplitude .",
    "this distribution of the intensities corresponds to a positive sign for the @xmath2 constant , i.e. to an easy - plane anisotropy .",
    "the above considerations suggest a way to identify the esr absorption spectrum features corresponding to @xmath50 .",
    "intense slightly asymmetric peaks observed at the left of the paramagnetic resonance position at low temperatures and peaks of similar shape that become more intense on heating correspond to @xmath46 .",
    "step - like changes of the absorption observed at the left and at the right of the paramagnetic resonance position , and intense features observed at low temperatures at the right of the paramagnetic resonance position correspond to grains with @xmath44 .",
    "the frequency - field diagram of the observed transitions is shown in .",
    "note that the @xmath44 components do not form equidistant lines .",
    "this indicates the presence of higher order contributions to the anisotropy energy .",
    "the general form of the spin - hamiltonian for the s=7/2 gd@xmath5 ion in the surroundings of @xmath29 symmetry is : @xmath51 where the stevens operators @xcite @xmath52 are functions of the components of the total angular momentum @xmath53 , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the notations of : @xmath56 .    , with @xmath572.0 , has been subtracted .",
    "@xmath44 features ( circles ) ; @xmath46 features ( squares ) ; features of the esr absorption which were hard to identify ( triangles ) ; calculated frequency - field dependences for @xmath46 ( solid lines ) ; calculated frequency - field dependences for @xmath44 ( dashed lines ) . ]",
    "we will consider only the second and fourth order axial terms , and we will suppose @xmath58 in the further analysis .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath59 constants can be found from the positions of the well - defined @xmath44 components corresponding to the @xmath60 and @xmath61 transitions ( two lowermost lines in ) . deviations of these transitions frequencies from the paramagnetic resonance position are @xmath62ghz and @xmath63ghz correspondingly .",
    "this gives the following values for the spin - hamiltonian constants : @xmath64mk and @xmath65mk .",
    "the amplitude of the second order anisotropy constant ( @xmath66=140mk ) is 35% smaller than the corresponding value in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath67mk ) .",
    "the frequency - field dependences for @xmath50 calculated for these parameter values are shown in .",
    "additionally , we have modeled the esr absorption line using . the simulation was performed by exact numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix combined with the averaging over the orientations of the grains crystallographic axes .",
    "the results are presented in .",
    "the calculated frequency - field dependences are in a good agreement with the observed ones .",
    "the simulated absorption spectra also demonstrate good agreement with the experimental data  they correctly reproduce the details of the line shape as well as the tendencies of the line shape change with the temperature .",
    "note that the correspondence between the simulated and observed absorption spectra can be improved by adding a broad absorption line located near the paramagnetic resonance position ( see ) .",
    "this additional contribution can not be attributed to isolated gd@xmath5 spins in the crystal field .",
    "the intensity of this additional absorption component increases with increasing temperature at low temperatures : the integral intensity of this broad line at 4.2k is twice as large as its integral intensity at 1.3k .",
    "the ratio of the intensities of the suggested broad absorption line and of the crystal - field split absorption is also temperature dependent : at 1.3k the most of the integral intensity is due to the crystal - field split absorption lines , while at 20k the broad absorption line dominates .",
    "a possible origin of this broad absorption line is the formation of antiferromagnetically coupled pairs of gd ions .",
    "the ground state of a pair is a nonmagnetic singlet , the total splitting between the s=0 ground state and the highest energy state ( s=7 ) is about @xmath68k .",
    "the dominating intensity of the broad line at 20k suggests a high concentration of these pairs , which indicates a tendency toward formation of gd clusters in y@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 matrix .",
    "however , the characteristic multi - component signal corresponding to the isolated s=7/2 gd@xmath5 ions can be distinguished and analyzed at low temperatures .",
    "the presence of exchange coupled pairs has also been observed by @xmath69yb mssbauer spectroscopy in y@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 doped with yb @xcite .",
    "we report on the esr in powder samples of ( y@xmath13gd@xmath14)@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 . the observed splitting of the esr absorption line allows to determine the values of the single - ion anisotropy constant for the gd ion .",
    "we find the value of the main anisotropy constant is about 35% smaller than that in titanate gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "possibly , this change of the anisotropy energy is responsible for the strong difference of the ordered state formed in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and gd@xmath0sn@xmath0o@xmath1 at low temperatures ."
