    "t tauri was initially identified as a single optical star , with unusual variability and peculiar emission lines ( barnard 1895 , joy 1945 and references therein ) .",
    "early infrared observations then revealed the existence of a heavily obscured companion ( hereafter t tau s ) located about @xmath4 to the south of the visible star ( dyck , simon & zuckerman 1982 ) , and most likely gravitationally bound to it ( ghez et al .",
    "recently , this infrared companion was itself found to contain two sources ( t tau sa and t tau sb koresko 2000 ; khler , kasper & herbst 2000 ) in rapid relative motion ( duchne , ghez & mccabe 2002 ; furlan et al .",
    "thus , t tau is now acknowledged to be at least a triple stellar system . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "t tau has long been known to be a double source ( schwartz , simon & campbell 1986 ) .",
    "the northern radio component is associated with the optical star , and mostly traces the base of its thermal jet ( e.g.  johnston et al .",
    "2003 ) , whereas the southern radio source is related to the infrared companion , and is thought to be the superposition of a compact component of magnetic origin and an extended halo , presumably related to stellar winds ( johnston et al .",
    "2003 , loinard et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the relative motions between the various components of the t tau system have recently been under enhanced scrutiny , following the suggestion , based on multi - epoch vla observations , that one of the components might have seen its path dramatically altered by a recent chaotic encounter ( loinard et al .",
    "this interpretation was disputed by johnston et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004b ) and tamazian ( 2004 ) , who fitted the same vla data with stable orbits .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that the residuals between their best fits and the actual radio positions ( @xmath5  @xmath6 ) are often significantly larger than the nominal observational errors ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) , especially at recent epochs ( see tab .",
    "6 in johnston et al .",
    "2004b ) . to resolve this discrepancy , johnston et al .",
    "( 2004a , 2004b ) proposed that the structure of t tau s at radio wavelengths was affected by erratic internal variations , which made the centroid of the vla source dither around the position of the underlying pms star . to reconcile the radio observations obtained in the last few years with the orbital fits , the vla source centroid needs to have moved about 25 mas yr@xmath0 faster than the associated pms star .",
    "clearly , this would render the existing 20 years of vla observations useless as tracers of the stellar trajectories , in spite of the high quality astrometry naturally provided by radio interferometry .",

    "specifically , the emission is expected to be either gyrosynchrotron radiation associated with reconnection flares in the stellar magnetosphere and at the star - disk interface ; or coherently amplified cyclotron emission from magnetized accretion funnels connecting the disk to the star ( dulk 1985 , feigelson & montmerle 1999 , smith et al .",
    "2003 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the emission is produced within less than about 10 stellar radii ( roughly 30 r@xmath15 ) of the star itself .",
    "indeed , 3.6 cm vlbi observations recently revealed the existence , near the expected position of t tau sb , of a source with an angular size less than about 15 r@xmath15  ( smith et al .",
    "because it is so small , any structural changes in this compact radio component would occur on such small scales that the effects on the astrometry would be very limited .",
    "thus , observations focusing on it should accurately trace the path of the underlying pms star .",
    "here , we present the results of a series of seven continuum 3.6 cm ( 8.42 ghz ) observations of t tau s obtained every two months between september 2003 and september 2004 with the 10-element very long baseline array ( vlba ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ; tab .  1 ) .",
    "since the vlba is only sensitive to compact emission structures with high surface brightness , it will effectively filter out the extended radio halo of t tau s , and provide images of the non - thermal source alone .",
    "our phase center was at @xmath16 = @xmath17 , @xmath18 = + @xmath19 , the position of the compact source detected by smith et al .",
    "each observation consisted of a series of cycles with two minutes spent on source , and one minute spent on the phase - referencing quasar j0428 + 1732 ( @xmath16 = @xmath20 , @xmath18 = + @xmath21 ) , located @xmath22 away .",
    "the secondary quasar j0431 + 1731 ( @xmath16 = @xmath23 , @xmath18 = + @xmath24 ) was also observed periodically ( about every 30 minutes ) ; it was not used in the phase calibration process , but served as a check on the final astrometry . based on the dispersion on the measured position of that quasar",
    ", we estimate our astrometric uncertainties to be about 0.25 mas in both @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "data editing , amplitude calibration , and fringe fitting ( carried out only on the calibrators , since the target is much too weak ) were made in a standard way using nrao s aips software .",
    "once calibrated , the visibilities were imaged with a pixel size of 0.25 mas after weights intermediate between natural and uniform were applied .",
    "the compact radio source associated with t tau s was detected at all seven epochs with high signal - to - noise ratio ( tab .  1 ) .",
    "its flux density varies significantly , from a maximum of nearly 1.8 mjy , down to a minimum of just over 1.0 mjy .",
    "moreover , its peak brightness in mjy beam@xmath0 is found to be always significantly smaller than its flux density in mjy ( on average by 35 % tab .  1 ) .",
    "this suggests that the emission is somewhat extended since equal numerical values are expected for a point source .",
    "this possibility gains further credibility when one considers the restored images ( fig .",
    "1a - c ) , where the emission is consistently found to be composed of a compact source ( most certainly associated with a stellar magnetosphere ) and a low brightness `` spur '' extending eastwards .",
    "although this latter component was not reported by smith et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , inspection of their published image ( their fig .",
    "1 ) reveals a source structure quite similar to that found here , with a weak spur extending towards the north - east of a compact component .",
    "when our seven observations are combined , the low brightness spur becomes even more evident ( fig .",
    "1d ) ; its position angle is between + 70@xmath27 and + 80@xmath27 , and its deconvolved extent in that direction is about 1 mas . since the measured parallactic and proper motions ( sect .",
    "3.2 ) imply a maximum displacement of about 0.02 mas during any one of our 6-hour observing runs , the measured size is not affected by smearing effects .",
    "the observed spur is also very unlikely to be a consequence of random errors in the phase calibration , since its characteristics repeat themselves from one epoch to the next .",
    "t tau s contains two infrared sources , so one might be tempted to associate the eastern spur to this preferred direction of the system .",
    "however , extrapolating from the latest published infrared observations ( furlan et al .  2003 ; duchne et al . , in prep . )",
    ", we estimate that the position angle between t tau sb and t tau sa at the median epoch of our vlba observations must have been about 110@xmath27 , significantly larger than the position angle of the spur .",
    "another unlikely possibility is that it would trace a weak secondary component . given the short distance which would then separate the two vlba sources , orbital motions should have been easily detected over the course of our observations .",
    "interestingly , the spur is nearly exactly perpendicular to the jet acknowledged to be powered by t tau s ( solf & bhm 1999 ) .",
    "this might suggest that the low brightness extension is associated with an accretion disk , and results from reconnection flares at the star - disk interface . indeed , duchne et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported the detection of a wavelength - dependent infrared excess around t tau sb , which strongly suggests the existence of an accretion disk there .",
    "typically , the inner edge of that disk is expected to be at a radius of about @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the stellar radius ( ostriker & shu 1995 ) . a low - mass pms star such as t tau sb is expected to have a radius of about 3 r@xmath15  ( siess , dufour & forestini 2000 ) .",
    "hence , the inner disk edge is expected to be at 15 r@xmath15  ( 0.07 au ) . at a distance of 141.5 pc ( see sect .",
    "3.2 ) , this corresponds to an angular scale of about 0.5 mas .",
    "after convolution with our beam size in @xmath25 ( on average 0.82 mas ) , we obtain an expected observed extent of 0.9 mas for the spur .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the measured extent . in this scheme ,",
    "it is , however , somewhat puzzling that we only see structure on one side of the star .",
    "as figs .",
    "1a to 1c readily show , the absolute position of the source changes significantly from one epoch to the next .",
    "these displacements most certainly result from parallactic and proper motions , and can be modeled in terms of the source position at epoch j2000.0 ( @xmath16 and @xmath18 ) , its proper motion in right ascension and declination ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , and its parallax @xmath1 .",
    "these five astrometric elements were deduced from the measured positions of the source by minimizing the @xmath32 associated with this description using an iterative scheme ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the results for the five astrometric parameters are :    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     the excellent agreement between the infrared and the radio proper motions confirms that the magnetically active pms star generating the compact radio emission is t tau sb , and that the radio data ( from both vla and vlba ) can be used to trace its trajectory .",
    "the vlba data presented here have allowed a detailed study of the structure and astrometry of the compact radio source associated with t tau s. the emission is found to be composed of a compact core most certainly originating from a stellar magnetosphere , and a low - brightness extension which may result from reconnection flares at the star - disk interface .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute astrometry offered by the vlba has made it possible for us to demonstrate that the infrared , the vla , and the vlba observations all trace the same underlying star ( t tau sb ) .",
    "this implies , in particular , that any orbital fit to the t tau system must be able to reproduce the positions measured by the vla in the last 20 years .",
    "finally , the vlba data have allowed us to measure the distance to t tau with unprecedented accuracy : @xmath33 = 141.5@xmath3 pc .",
    "this is in good agreement with the traditionally accepted value for taurus ( @xmath33 = 140 @xmath2 10 pc kenyon , dobrzycka & hartmann 1994 ) , and seemingly rules out the possibility of large distance gradients across taurus .",
