    "density jumps have been recently pinpointed by x - ray imaging of the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) that pervades galaxy groups and clusters with average densities around @xmath0 @xmath1 and temperatures @xmath2 in the kev range .",
    "these jumps have been interpreted in terms of shock fronts propagating into the icm out to radial distances @xmath3 mpc , with mach numbers around @xmath4 , and involving energies up to @xmath5 ergs ( mazzotta et al .",
    "2004 ; mc namara et al .",

    "2005a , b ) .",
    "shocks over large scales with such _ intermediate _ strengths were specifically expected by cavaliere , lapi & menci ( 2002 ) as marks of the energy being fed back into the icm by active galactic nuclei ( agns ) when they flare up in member galaxies of a group or cluster .",
    "such events occur when a central supermassive black hole ( bh ) accretes an additional mass @xmath6 ; with standard efficiency @xmath7 for mass - energy conversion , this yields over times @xmath8 yr energies of order @xmath9 ergs .",
    "if these outputs couple at levels @xmath10 a few percents to the surrounding icm , they constitute impulsive , considerable additions @xmath11 ergs to its binding energy .",
    "in fact , the latter comes to @xmath12 ergs in the central @xmath13 mpcs of a cluster , that encompass a dark matter ( dm ) mass @xmath14 and an icm mass fraction @xmath15 . with such appreciable ratios @xmath16",
    ", we expect in the icm a large - scale _ blastwave _ bounded by a leading _ shock _ that starts from the host galaxy and moves into the surrounding icm out to several @xmath17 mpc .",
    "in fact , the shock mach numbers are provided in the simple form @xmath18 by the hydrodynamics of the icm ( see lapi , cavaliere & menci 2005 ) , a good electron - proton plasma which in thermal equilibrium ( see   4 ) constitutes a single  monoatomic \" fluid with pressure @xmath19 . for bh masses bounded by @xmath20 ( ferrarese 2002 ;",
    "tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) relative energy inputs @xmath21 obtain and yield just @xmath4 ; they also yield standard rankine - hugoniot jumps of the post- to the pre - shock density @xmath22 , consistent with the x - ray analyses .",
    "what other marks will establish such shocks and blasts ?",
    "one is constituted by the temperature .",
    "this rises sharply across a shock but then falls down in the blast , if nothing else by adiabatic cooling . in any case , resolved spectroscopic measurements of the electron @xmath2 require many x - ray photons , more than currently available from distant clusters or groups .",
    "pressure provides another , independent mark ; the electron pressure is _ directly _ sensed with the sz effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) . the pressure at the shock is to jump up from the unperturbed level @xmath23 by the factor @xmath24 , which marks a shock from a cold front ; moreover , @xmath25 must retain sufficiently high levels throughout the blast as to propel forward the icm it sweeps up .",
    "we will see that the radial pressure run @xmath26 actually _ rises _ from the leading shock to an inner `` cavity '' , as long as the blast is driven on by a central agn .",
    "power must be transmitted from it to the surrounding icm blast by means of an intervening medium .",
    "this may be constituted either by relativistic particles filling up a radiovolume energized by jets ( scheuer 1974 ; heinz , reynolds , & begelman 1998 ) ; or by another and hotter plasma heated up by the impact of radiation - driven superwinds ( see lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) .",
    "thus sz pressure probing will have direct implications for the kind and the time - cycle of the agn outputs , in particular of the radio - loud components .",
    "in predicting pressure distributions , a divide is set by the source time scale @xmath27 compared to the blast crossing time @xmath28 yr ; here @xmath29 is the shock radial position , and @xmath30 its velocity in terms of the sound speed @xmath31 .    the impact on the icm of a short lived agn source may be modeled as an instantaneous central explosion launching the classic self - similar blasts of sedov ( 1959 ) and parker ( 1963 ) ; these propagate freely at high if decreasing mach numbers @xmath32 ( which make @xmath23 and gravity irrelevant ) into an initial density run @xmath33 . when the latter is provided in the form @xmath34 by the standard atmosphere in isothermal equilibrium , the pressure @xmath25 in the blast declines toward the center .",
    "steeper density runs yield an even stronger decline , whilst flatter ones still imply @xmath35 .    but in some sources the observations recalled in   1 show proximity of the shocks to the edge of the radiovolumes .",
    "this indicates blasts being currently _ driven _ by the relativistic particles associated with the radiosource , and calls for considering agn outputs sustained during the propagation . a similar indication is provided by the evidence at redshifts @xmath36 of superwinds driven by shining quasars ( see stockton et al .",
    "the moderate values observed for @xmath32 require including the effects of _ gravity _ and _ finite _ initial pressure @xmath23 .",
    "these conditions are aptly modeled with the self - similar blasts derived and discussed by lapi et al .",
    "a significant testbed is again provided by the isothermal distribution of both the dm and the unperturbed icm in the gravitational field of the former ; their cumulative masses out to @xmath37 scale like @xmath38 , and the icm pressure like @xmath39 .",
    "the overall parameters of the perturbing blast may be derived from the simple `` shell approximation '' , long known to be effective and precise ( see cavaliere & messina 1976 ; ostriker & mckee 1988 ) .",
    "this treats the blast as a shell containing the mass @xmath40 swept up out to the radius @xmath41 , and propelled outward by the volume - averaged pressure @xmath42 against , we add , the upstream pressure @xmath23 and the dm gravity @xmath43 .",
    "it leads to the momentum equation @xmath44 = 4 \\pi\\ , r^2_s \\ , [ \\langle p \\rangle - p_1 ] - { g\\ , m(<r_s)\\over r^2_s}\\ , m(<r_s)\\ ] ] in terms of the postshock speed @xmath45 . here",
    "the pressure terms scale following @xmath46 const , as does the gravitational term .",
    "self - similar solutions require also the l.h.s . to remain constant as the blast moves out ; since @xmath47 holds ( with @xmath48 const ) , the only consistent solution must satisfy @xmath49 .",
    "thus the shock moves outward following @xmath50 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the gravitational energy in the dm potential well scales like @xmath51 , and so do all energies including the binding @xmath52 ; this implies for the energy injection @xmath53 to hold , that is , the power @xmath54 const is _ sustained _ over a crossing time .",
    "then the blast runs unattenuated with @xmath55)$ ] and @xmath56 independent of time and position .",
    "the actual existence of the self - similar solutions is proven from the full hydro equations . by self - similarity",
    "these reduce to a set of three ordinary differential equations in the normalized variable @xmath57 , that can be integrated inward of the shock where rankine - hugoniot boundary conditions hold , see lapi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . here",
    "we focus on the shape of @xmath58 that is plotted in detail in fig .  1 ( _ left _ panel ) .    the point to stress is that @xmath58 _ rises _ from the shock to the blast inner boundary , namely , the `` piston '' .",
    "this is the contact discontinuity separating the icm from the inner medium in the cavity ; the mass @xmath59 of swept - up gas piles up there , causing the density to diverge mildly whereas the temperature @xmath60 vanishes . in the blast",
    "the two combine to yield a rising @xmath58 ; at the piston this attains a value @xmath61 exceeding @xmath62 by factors @xmath63 ( see fig .  1 ) , larger at lower @xmath64 .",
    "the rising trend is best understood in the shell approximation on computing the coefficients of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , given the scalings above ; simple algebra and some labor yield @xmath65 = { 5 \\,{\\mathcal m}^2 + 7 \\over 5 \\,{\\mathcal m}^2 - 1}~.\\ ] ] the first additive term in the middle expression embodies the contribution to @xmath66 from the shell momentum ; the second , those from the initial pressure ( contributing @xmath67 ) plus gravitation ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the final expression shows that @xmath69 and hence the monotonic @xmath70 go to unity for @xmath71 , the result known from sedov blasts launched into a density gradient with negligible gravity and initial pressure . on the other hand , @xmath66 and @xmath70 increase as @xmath72 ; this concurs with the lowering jump @xmath73 to yield an overall value @xmath61 which decreases slowly with @xmath32 , as shown by fig .  1 .    in sum , a driving source excavates in the icm a cavity with very low inner x - ray emission ;",
    "this is bounded by the blast ( from a rim at the piston to the leading shock ) in a cocoon - like topology .",
    "enhanced values @xmath74 relate mainly to gravity , important to the icm as long as all velocities do not exceed @xmath75 , or the dm velocity dispersion ; so at lower @xmath32 a relatively stronger push is required to propel the cocoon on .    from the energy standpoint , high values of @xmath61 may be viewed as necessary for soaking up  in the form of work @xmath76 done at the piston  the power fraction transferred from the source via the inner medium filling the cavity .",
    "the fraction is @xmath77 when the medium is constituted by relativistic particles , see cavaliere & messina ( 1976 ) , and @xmath78 in the case of a thermalized superwind .",
    "the enhanced pressures in the blast can be _ directly _ probed with the sz effect .",
    "this arises when photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) crossing a cluster are compton upscattered by the hot icm electrons ; then the black body spectrum of the cmb is tilted slightly toward higher energies .    the resulting intensity change @xmath79 of the cmb radiation at a normalized frequency @xmath80",
    "is given in the thermal , non - relativistic case ( rephaeli 1995 ) by @xmath81 the effect strength is set by the comptonization parameter @xmath82 just proportional to the electron _ pressure _ @xmath83 integrated along the line of sight ( l.o.s . ) at a projected distance @xmath84 from the cluster center ; @xmath85 applies if the icm boundary is set at the virial radius @xmath86 .",
    "the spectral shape is encoded in the factor @xmath87 .",
    "this has a crossover point at @xmath88 ghz ; it is positive for larger @xmath89 with a peak at @xmath90 ghz , and negative for lower @xmath89 with a minimum at @xmath91 ghz .",
    "the approximation @xmath92 applies at the rayleigh - jeans end of the cmb spectrum .",
    "as @xmath93 holds , we expect that in an agn - driven blast the sz signal is _ enhanced _ from shock to piston , relative to the equilibrium value @xmath94 on the l.o.s . grazing the shock . in fig .  1 ( _ right _ panels ) we show the outcome of our computations based on eq .  ( 3 ) and on @xmath58 given on the left .",
    "we describe our results beginning with @xmath95 ghz .",
    "the rise of @xmath96 shown in the _ top right _ panel starts up at the shock position @xmath97 with a high derivative arising from the contribution of the pressure jump @xmath73 to the l.o.s .",
    "the subsequent rise toward the piston reflects the further pressure increase into the blast .",
    "inward of the piston @xmath96 rises still _ further _ when the inner medium is constituted by a very hot thermal plasma with constant pressure @xmath61 ( _ dashed _ lines ) ; this is closely the case with a thermalized superwind , where @xmath75 is high owing to the high pressure @xmath98 and the low density @xmath99 .    on the contrary , @xmath96 _",
    "declines _ for @xmath100 ( _ solid _ lines ) when the cavity within @xmath101 is filled with relativistic electrons ( with @xmath102 ) .",
    "in fact , these provide the pressure @xmath103 but contribute little to the overall sz signal on two grounds .",
    "first , relativistic pressures @xmath104 imply low electron densities even with minimal lorentz factors of a few ( see pfrommer , enlin & sarazin 2005 ; colafrancesco 2005 ) .",
    "second , relativistic electrons are generally inefficient contributors at a given @xmath89 since the tilt they cause in the cmb spectrum is stretched toward high frequencies .    for comparison",
    ", we also show the thermal sz effect produced by free sedov - taylor blastwaves launched by a strong but short explosion ( _ dotted _ lines ) . here",
    "the pressure declines below @xmath62 after the shock jump , so @xmath96 rises modestly inward of @xmath97 and soon decreases .",
    "in fact , the _ right _ panels of fig .  1 show the shapes of @xmath96 expected with sz instruments having two angular resolutions ; in the _ top _ panel we show our results smoothed with a gaussian window of @xmath105 ( about @xmath106 kpc at @xmath107 ) , and in the _ bottom _ panel with @xmath108 ( about @xmath109 kpc ) .",
    "the latter resolution is currently achieved , while the former will be attained in the near future , see   4 .    for frequencies above @xmath110 ghz , similar shapes obtain for @xmath111 , except that the non - thermal contribution is generally lower than plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "the thermal / non - thermal ratio is maximized at @xmath112 ghz , to decline only at much larger @xmath89 . at @xmath88 ghz only the non - thermal component survives ; here the spatial shape of the sz signal differs significantly on two accounts .",
    "first , the rise begins at the piston position @xmath113 with a sharp transition of @xmath114 up to @xmath61 ; second , saturation occurs at low levels .",
    "finally , we discuss why the initial isothermal atmosphere , where @xmath115 applies with @xmath116 , provides reliable evaluations of the sz signals from driven blasts .",
    "flatter runs with @xmath117 occur in a cluster at @xmath118 kpc ; here the gravity is weaker but the mass @xmath119 swept up by the blast increases faster , and in the shell approximation eq .",
    "( 2 ) yields for @xmath120 a value @xmath121 of the isothermal case .",
    "steeper atmospheres corresponding to @xmath122 occur for @xmath123 kpc ; these also yield self - similar blasts propagating at constant @xmath32 when acted upon by a fading agn with integrated energy @xmath124 .",
    "the outcomes include larger pressure jumps but also flatter runs of @xmath26 at equal values of @xmath16 ( see lapi et al .",
    "2005 ) ; overall , somewhat higher levels of @xmath61 obtain .",
    "sz signals are widely measured in clusters at levels @xmath125 , see reese et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and birkinshaw ( 2004 ) ; lapi , cavaliere & de zotti ( 2003 ) discuss sub - arcmin resolutions to detect the integrated effects of agn outbursts on the icm of clusters and groups . here",
    "we have focused on sz signals _ resolved _ at levels of @xmath108 or better , to probe the structure and the dynamics of the shocks and blasts so produced .",
    "the sz probe is best used in scanning the icm around density jumps selected in x - rays .",
    "in fact , the bremsstrahlung surface brightness proportional to @xmath126 is well suited for pinpointing density jumps and providing positions and mach numbers of candidate shocks . but measuring @xmath2 from x - ray spectroscopy must contend with paucity of photons and the narrow post - shock range where @xmath2 exceeds the unperturbed value .    so in conditions of low surface brightness ( outskirts or distant structures ) the sz effect will lend a strong hand by unveiling the other key observable , namely , the overpressures behind the shocks ; this is due to three circumstances .",
    "first , pressures are sensed _ directly _ through the parameter @xmath127 .",
    "second , @xmath128 is independent of @xmath129 for sources wider than the instrumental beamwidth .",
    "third , we expect ( see fig .",
    "1 ) thermal pressures to rise throughout a blast continuously _ driven _ over a crossing time ; from shock to piston at radii @xmath130 smaller , @xmath26 rises up to values @xmath131 , considerably larger than the shock jump @xmath132 for @xmath133 ; this is due to the dynamical stress in running blasts .",
    "this rising behavior of @xmath26 is just opposite to the run down from shock to center expected for _ free _ blasts launched by short - lived agn activity .",
    "we compare in fig .",
    "1 the results we expect ; they constitute an aim particularly interesting for shocks of intermediate @xmath32 pinpointed in close proximity to a radiovolume or around a currently shining agn .",
    "clear study cases will be provided by clusters or groups in quiet conditions , with no sign of outer merger induced dynamics .",
    "what is needed for sz probing at @xmath107 is a resolution around @xmath108 in the upper @xmath134wave band , already approached with the nobeyama radiotelescope ( kitayama et al .",
    "2004 , also http://www.nro.nao.ac.jp/index-e.html/ ) .",
    "upcoming instruments such as carma ( http://www.mmarray.org/ ) will do better ; at resolutions of a few arcsecs , blasts in clusters at @xmath135 may be probed at levels comparable to the _ top right _ panel of fig .  1 .",
    "alma ( http://www.alma.nrao.edu/ ) with its planned resolutions around @xmath105 and sensitivities down to @xmath136k , will do better yet both in the @xmath134wave and in the submm band . following the noise analysis by pfrommer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , a @xmath137 detection with alma of the thermal sz signal we focus on will require scanning a limited area in the vicinity of an x - ray preselected position for a few hours per cluster .",
    "we add that once kpc scales will be resolved , two - fluid effects will be interesting as may arise from disequilibrium between the electrons and ions ( see ettori & fabian 1998 ; fabian et al .",
    "2006 ) . they may cause a gradual rise of the electron pressure in front of the shock , to converge behind it with the declining ion pressure toward the equilibrium values considered above .    here",
    "we stress three issues .",
    "first , how common are shocks in clusters ?",
    "the frequent occurrence of quenched cooling flows argues for widespread shocks driven over some gyrs by central agns injecting energies @xmath138 in excess of the cooling losses ( see brzan et al .",
    "2004 ; nulsen et al .",
    "2005a , b ) .",
    "second , in what prevailing mode does an agn release the driving energy @xmath138 , in mechanical form and radio jets or in radiation - driven superwinds ? to a first approximation",
    "the mode little affects the total energy injected , based on the simple rule @xmath139 const that we extract from churazov et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; that is , mechanical energy and jets gain on grounds of coupling efficiency ( @xmath140 vs. a few @xmath141 ) what they lose to radiation on grounds of @xmath142 .",
    "conversely , the shock energetics alone will not distinguish the mode .",
    "third , what other probe may help ?",
    "the specific sz probing we propose can trace the distinguishing features of the injection : its timescale ( past or ongoing ) , and its prevailing content ( relativistic particles or photons ) .",
    "the sz effect resolved at levels of @xmath108 or better will directly detect the mark of a blast launched or driven by a powerful agn , namely , the hydro overpressure _ jumping _ up at the shock and _ sustained _ throughout the blast .",
    "but when the radiosource drive persists over the transit time the pressure actually _ rises _ in the blast , and the sz signal is enhanced ; it is boosted up by plasma in the cavity if the drive is helped by agn superwinds .",
    "these outcomes are independent of model details , rather they depend on a few overall parameters : the relative injection energy @xmath143 , evaluated from @xmath32 ; the active time of the agn compared with the blast crossing time ; the injection mode , whether dominantly in mechanical or radiative energy .",
    "we conclude that sz measurements concurring with the x - ray imaging can effectively probe the injection mode , the dynamics of the blasts , and the history of the driving agn sources ."
