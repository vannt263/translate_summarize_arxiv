    "the blazar pks 0420@xmath0014 ( z=0.915 ) is active and strongly variable at all wavelengths .",
    "it is a rosat source @xcite and has been identified as an egret gamma - ray source @xcite .",
    "the total flux density of pks 0420@xmath0014 has been monitored extensively at many wavelengths .",
    "the routine monitoring at 4.8 , 8.0 , and 14.5ghz was carried out by the 26 m paraboloid in the university of michigan @xcite . the millimeter and submillimeter observations at 22 , 37 , 90 , 150 , 230 , 270 , and 375ghz were taken at the 15-m james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , sest(swedish - eso submillimetre telescope ) , the iram 30 m telescope @xcite and mrrs(metshovi radio research station)@xcite . simultaneous optical and gamma - ray flare was detected in 1992 @xcite .",
    "the blazar pks 0420@xmath0014 has been observed with vlbi at 43ghz , 8.4ghz , 5ghz and 2.3ghz since 1986 .",
    "five images at 8.4ghz and the results from model fitting are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "images at 5 ghz are presented in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who observed the source in 1986 , 1992 and 1995 respectively .",
    "these observations show that the jet components move along a bending trajectory .",
    "superluminal proper motion was found in this source @xcite .    some properties of the radio flares",
    "were successfully explained by a model incorporating an adiabatically expanding shocked region @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the spectral evolution of the radio flares occurred in 1991 and 1992 in pks 0420 - 014 .    in this paper",
    "we present two 5ghz vlbi observations , carried out in 1996 june and 1997 november .",
    "an analysis of our data and former vlbi results , combined with the study of the total flux density variations , led us to identify the location of the emitting regions of these flares , which we classify according to the properties of their light curves . throughout this paper , the values @xmath1",
    "@xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 will be used .",
    "the long term light curves at 4.8 , 8.0 , and 14.5ghz are shown in figure [ fig1 ] . in order to compare the flare flux density , we subtracted the quiescent core flux density at each frequency , assuming a flat quiescent core spectrum .",
    "the quiescent core flux density , about 1.2 jy , was estimated from 8.4ghz vlbi observation at epoch 1994.52 , when the source was in its lowest state . from the data plotted in figure 1 we can identify six strong flares(represented by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) , which occurred in 1983 , 1985 , 1990 , 1992 , 1995 , and 1998 .",
    "some minor flares may also exist , but they are not very significant at these three frequencies .",
    "we classified the flares according to the time lags of the maximums at the various frequencies .",
    "flare 2 and 5 are characterized by large lags between the peaks of light curves at different frequencies .",
    "we use polynomials to fit the un - averaged flux data and then determine the peaks of the light curves(see table [ tbl-0 ] ) . for flare 2 , the lags @xmath6 t between 14.5 and 8.0 ghz and between 8.0 and 4.8 ghz are @xmath6t@xmath7 yr and @xmath6t@xmath8 yr respectively .",
    "the corresponding lags for flare 5 are @xmath6t@xmath9 yr and @xmath6t@xmath10 yr respectively .",
    "we named these as _ core flares _ , or _",
    "class i flares _ ( @xmath6t@xmath11 yr ) .",
    "the remaining strong flares show no or small lags and can be grouped together .",
    "the prototype of this class is flare 4 .",
    "its light curves reach their peak simultaneously at epoch @xmath12 .",
    "we named these _ jet flares _ or _ class ii flares _",
    "( @xmath6t@xmath13 yr ) .",
    "this classification still holds when we add 37 ghz and 90 ghz data ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "large time lags exist between the millimeter and centimeter light curves of flare 5 , while flare 4 peaks simultaneously in the whole range of frequencies from 4.8 ghz to 90 ghz .",
    "a new remarkable feature is a strong millimeter flare occurred at the end of 1991(represented by g in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding centimeter flare was much weaker .",
    "since it shows lags between high and low frequencies , we classify it as a class i flare",
    ". we will discuss it in detail in section 4 .",
    "our two 5ghz vlbi observations were carried out on 1996 june 17 , and on 1997 november 07 with evn(european vlbi network ) .",
    "eight telescopes took part in the 1996 observations , i.e. shanghai , crimea , noto , hartebeesthoek(affiliated ) , urumqi , onsala , wsrt , and torun .",
    "the nine telescopes participating in the 1997 observations are effelsberg , jodrell bank , medicina , shanghai , noto , hartebeesthoek , urumqi , wsrt , and torun .",
    "the recording modes were mkiii mode e ( bandwidth 14mhz ) and mkiii mode b ( bandwidth 28mhz ) for the 1996 and 1997 epochs respectively .",
    "the data were correlated at mpifr mk iii correlator in bonn .    a - priori amplitude calibration and fringe - fitting",
    "were carried out using the standard routines in the aips package .",
    "imaging was done using the difmap difference mapping software @xcite .",
    "the 1996 and 1997 final images are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "for the map of 1996 , the noise is 1.68mjy / beam , the map peak is 1.41jy / beam , and the fwhm is 1.08x0.85(mas ) at @xmath14 . for the map of 1997 ,",
    "the noise is 1.85mjy / beam , the map peak is 1.37jy / beam , and the fwhm is 1.17x0.79(mas ) at @xmath15 . in order to carry out the image analysis",
    ", we used the program ` modelfit ' in difmap to fit the final self - calibrated uv data with gaussian components . the model fitting results are given in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "we estimate that the errors of the parameters are : @xmath6flux = @xmath16 20@xmath17 , @xmath6radius = @xmath18 mas , @xmath6p.a .",
    "= @xmath19 , @xmath20 10@xmath17 , @xmath6rat .",
    "= @xmath16 15@xmath17 and @xmath6 p.a .",
    "= @xmath21 .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig2 ] and table [ tbl-1 ] that the two images differ considerably .",
    "the size and flux of the core are very similar in the two epochs",
    ". however the position of the first jet component ( a ) with respect to the core changed from 1.1 mas to 1.3 mas going from 1996 to 1997 .",
    "its position angle also changed , and the flux decreased from 0.39 to 0.15 jy .",
    "the result of our model fitting shows that component b is stationary .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we plotted the relative positions of the jet components with respect to the core from 1990.38 to 1997.85 . in this",
    "figure positions 1 , 2 , 3 , 4@xcite , and 6@xcite are from 8.4ghz images ; positions 5@xcite , 7@xcite , 8 , and 9 are from 5ghz images .",
    "the observing epochs are listed in legend . for each epoch",
    "we identified the component closest to the core with component a in our images , and the more distant component with b. from figure 3 , it is clear that component a emerges from the core in the south - west direction . at radius",
    "@xmath22 mas and p.a .",
    "@xmath23 , the jet bends abruptly and turns from south - west to south - east , and then slowly curves to south , which is in agreement with the large scale vlbi map at 18 cm @xcite and vla ( very large array ) map at 20 cm @xcite .    the position of component a changes smoothly from 1990.38 to 1995.82 , suggesting a proper motion @xmath24 mas yr@xmath25 , which corresponds to a liner velocity of @xmath26 .",
    "this jet component probably emerged from the core at @xmath27 1985.5 when strong flare 2 visible in figure [ fig1 ] began . while the position of a in 1997.85 is in good agreement with this proper motion , its location in 1996.46 is difficult to understand , both because of the large motion from 1995.82 to 1996.46 , i.e. @xmath28 mas @xmath29 and because of the abrupt change in position angle .",
    "it is possible that we mis - identified component a in 1996.46 .",
    "we also note that the location of component a in 1996.46 is in much better agreement with the location of component b at the epochs labelled 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "another remarkable feature in figure 3 is the different kinematical behaviour of component a , within 1.3 mas from the core , and component b , beyond this distance .",
    "component b does not appear continuously along the jet path",
    ". gaps where the jet is undetected are clearly visible . this can be easily explained assuming that the jet component ( or knot ) moves along a helical jet path and rotates around the jet axis . under this assumption",
    "the viewing angle of the jet component changes continuously . when the viewing angle near its minimum value , the corresponding doppler factor is large and the component is visible ; when the viewing angle near its maximum value , the corresponding doppler factor is small , and the component may disappear .    in order to locate the origin of the radio flares ,",
    "we add the total vlbi flux density , the core flux density and the flux density of component a of ten vlbi observations in figure 1 .",
    "both the total vlbi flux density and the core flux density were subtracted by 1.2 jy of quiescent core flux . as we can see from figure 1 , the class 1 flares , such as the 1985 one , are dominated by a core flux density increase ,",
    "while the flux density variations of jet component are much less and can be neglected .",
    "on the other hand , class 2 flares are dominated by jet flares .",
    "a typical such flare happened in 1992 .",
    "near the peak of this flare , vlbi observation @xcite showed that the flux of the component a was 1.7 jy , much greater than the 0.8 jy core flare flux .",
    "the core flare flux density is comparable with the flux of the component a during the intervals between 1990 and 1992 and between 1995 and 1997 .",
    "we conclude that pks 0420@xmath0014 is characterized by two different classes of flares , originating in different source regions : class 1 radio flares originate in the core , while class 2 flares come from jet components .",
    "optical depth is essential to explain the observed phenomena . in vlbi",
    ", core actually refers to the optically thick inner jet with flat spectrum , while jet refers to the optically thin outer jet with steep spectrum .",
    "as a new flare component generates in the core region , its emission will gradually become optically thin from high frequencies to low frequencies . as a results ,",
    "we see the time - lagged core flares .",
    "the jet flares , however , probably happens in the optically thin jet region .",
    "the classification of radio flares depends on their light curves as well as vlbi results",
    ". however , the core size in vlbi maps depends on the observing frequency and resolution .",
    "a flare component might be resolved as a jet component in a 43ghz high resolution vlbi map but still in the core in a 5ghz low resolution vlbi map .",
    "so , here , we need to point out that core flare happens within the core region based on 5ghz or 8.4ghz vlbi observations , usually with one milliarcsec resolutions .",
    "we propose that jet flares are due to the doppler boosting effect of knots moving along a helical jet .",
    "all the vlbi observations available show that the proper motion of the jet component emerged at 1985.5 is nearly constant .",
    "this implies that the variation of the lorentz factor and of the viewing angle are small .",
    "small variation of lorenz factor would not cause large variation of flux .",
    "however , because the average viewing angle of the jet in pks 0420@xmath0014 is small ( about @xmath30 @xcite ) , even a small change in the viewing angle would cause a great change of doppler factor as well as the flux of jet component @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the doppler factor is independent of the observing wavelength , which can naturally explain the simultaneous jet flares at different wavelengths .",
    "the intrinsic variation of the parameters of jet components may also cause flux variation , but can not fully explain the observed facts .",
    "the flare which took place at the end of 1991 was classified as core flare on the basis of a 5 months lag between the peak at 90ghz and at 14.5ghz .",
    "furthermore , @xcite detected a new jet component in a 43ghz vlbi observation at epoch 1992.40 .",
    "this component was about 0.2mas ( private communication ) away from the core , and was probably ejected during the late 1991 flare .",
    "however , the core flare in 1991 differs from the other core flares .",
    "it was much stronger at millimeter than at centimeter frequencies ; its flux density increase was very sharply at the beginning and faded away quickly ; last but not least it was accompanied by a simultaneous gamma - ray flare .",
    "thus , more work is needed to study the mechanism of this flare .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for his / her helpful comments .",
    "this research has made use of data from the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory which is supported by funds from the university of michigan .",
    "zhou thanks merja tornikoski for generously presenting the 37ghz and 90ghz sest observed flux data of pks 0420 - 014 .",
