    "our goal is to study the unitary subgroup @xmath13 and the group of symmetric units @xmath14 .",
    "the problem of determining the invariants and the basis of @xmath15 had been raised by s. p.  novikov .",
    "its solution for the canonical involution was given in @xcite ; here this result extended to arbitrary involutory involution .",
    "we start with some remarks about the invariants of unitary and symmetric subgroups to give a bases .",
    "since @xmath16 has an odd order and every @xmath17 can be written as @xmath18 , so @xmath19 where @xmath20 is unitary and @xmath21 is a symmetric unit . but every @xmath22 is such that @xmath23 ; since @xmath24 is odd order it follows @xmath25 and we have @xmath26 define the mappings @xmath27 given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively for @xmath30 .",

    "the subsets @xmath33 with @xmath34 form a partition of the set @xmath35 and let @xmath36 be the system of representatives of these subsets .",
    "clearly , @xmath37 can be uniquely written as @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , so the order of the group of symmetric units @xmath14 equals @xmath41 . by ( 3)@xmath42 , so as before , the order of @xmath43 is @xmath44 .",

    "( 1 ) it yields that the @xmath0-rank of @xmath53 equals @xmath54 it immediately follows that the number of components of order @xmath48 in the decomposition of the group @xmath13 into a direct product of cyclic groups is equal to @xmath55",
    "we will use the following well - known generators of @xmath16 ( see @xcite ) :    let @xmath2 be a finite abelian @xmath0-group , @xmath56 the augmentation ideal of @xmath3 and assume that @xmath57 . if @xmath58 is a basis for @xmath59 , then the units @xmath60 @xmath61 ; @xmath62 generate @xmath63 .",

    "the cardinality of @xmath79 is @xmath82 , and it is the @xmath0-rank of @xmath83 and the cardinality of @xmath84 is @xmath85 , which is the @xmath0-rank of @xmath86 .        * the invariants of the unitary subgroup @xmath13 are indicated in ( 5 ) and the set @xmath89 is basis for it , that is @xmath90 . * the invariants of the group of symmetric units",

    "@xcite asserts that @xmath129 is the order of @xmath16 and this gives that @xmath130 , so @xmath131 is a basis .",
    "it follows from the definition of the @xmath123 with @xmath88 that each of them is either fixed or inverted by the involution @xmath132 .",
