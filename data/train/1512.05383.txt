    "the next generation of galaxy surveys will map the distribution of matter in the universe with unprecedented accuracy over large cosmic volumes .",
    "surveys such as the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) and the euclid mission are designed to detect millions of galaxies over a wide range of scales and redshifts , potentially providing measurements of the clustering of matter to few per - cent statistical uncertainty . in order to infer unbiased cosmological parameter constraints",
    "the analysis of these data will require theoretical model predictions that account for the non - linearities of the late time gravitational collapse of matter .",
    "as an example , on the scales of the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) deviations from linear predictions are at a few per - cent level ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , even the availability of such accurate predictions may not suffice to correctly analyse the data , since non - linearities induce mode - couplings which cause errors on band powers to become increasingly correlated @xcite .",
    "because of this , future galaxy survey measurements will require accurate estimation of covariance matrices .    in the case of the matter power spectrum",
    "the covariance matrix can be estimated from large ensembles of n - body simulations @xcite . however , due to finite sampling , the estimation of the covariance is affected by statistical errors that propagates into the cosmological parameter uncertainties .",
    "the impact of such errors has been evaluated in a number of studies assuming gaussian distributed data ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , as shown by @xcite deviations from the linear clustering regime induce increasingly larger non - gaussian errors already at the bao scale . in principle",
    "the use of analytical models of the covariance avoids sampling errors ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for work in this direction ) .",
    "nonetheless , such models still need to match numerical simulation results and as shown by @xcite in the context of the halo model , model calibration uncertainties will propagate in the estimation of parameter errors .    in this work we set to assess what is the impact of non - linearities on the statistical errors associated with the sample covariance estimator and what are the effects on the cosmological parameter uncertainties expected from future galaxy surveys . to this purpose",
    "we use a large ensemble of n - body simulations to compare covariance matrix estimation errors against model predictions for gaussian distributed data .",
    "then , assuming euclid - like survey characteristics , we perform a fisher matrix analysis to forecast the impact of non - gaussian errors on cosmological parameter constraints .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec1 ] we introduce the n - body simulation ensemble used in the analysis ; in section  [ sec2 ] we discuss gaussian prediction of the sample covariance and precision matrix errors and present the comparison with estimates from the n - body simulation ensemble ; in section  [ sec_fisher ] we present the results of the fisher analysis and finally we discuss the conclusion in section  [ conclu ] .",

    "the spectra have been corrected for mass resolution errors as described in @xcite using simulation set b consisting of 96 n - body simulations of identical volume with @xmath16 particles corresponding to a mass resolution of @xmath17 m@xmath10 h@xmath11 at coarse level .",

    "thus , to be conservative from now on we set @xmath22 @xmath14 mpc@xmath11 unless otherwise specified .    using this ensemble of spectra we compute the covariance matrix at each redshift with the sample covariance estimator : @xmath23[\\hat{p}_n(k_j)-\\bar{p}(k_j)],\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the number of independent realisations and @xmath25 is the sample mean , with @xmath26 the matter power spectrum of the @xmath27-th realisation .",

    "a standard likelihood analysis will use these measurements to infer constraints on a set of parameters @xmath30 given a model prediction of the power spectrum @xmath31 . assuming that the density contrast in fourier space is gaussian distributed ,",
