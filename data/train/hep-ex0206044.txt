    "nucleon elastic scattering a very attractive tool for the exchange mechanism investigation .",
    "so far , the elastic proton  proton scattering was studied up to the highest isr energies ( @xmath9 gev ) while for @xmath10 the measurements reached @xmath11 tev .",
    "the isr data confirmed earlier prediction @xcite of the total cross section rise with energy .",
    "also pomeranchuk s prediction @xcite on the asymptotic behaviour of the total cross sections for @xmath12 and @xmath10 scattering was extensively tested .",
    "summary of elastic scattering measurements and phenomenological models can be found in @xcite .    with advent of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory",
    "a new energy domain opens for a study of the proton - proton scattering .",
    "the accelerator is capable of delivering proton beams @xcite polarized up to 70% with luminosities reaching @xmath13 .",
    "this offers a unique opportunity for a systematic study of the spin dependent and spin independent elastic scattering in a new , mostly unexplored centre - of - mass energy range of @xmath1 gev and for the four - momentum transfer @xmath2 @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the colliding of polarized beams allows for the measurement of the proton helicity structure in wide range of @xmath4 and energy within a single experiment .",
    "the polarization studies will shed a light onto emerging new picture of diffraction and its spin dependence @xcite .",
    "the qcd proved to be very successful in describing hadronic interactions at large @xmath4 where perturbative methods are applicable .",
    "however , for small and medium @xmath4 values in elastic and diffractive scattering , in a the long - range domain , the qcd has not yet provided accurate predictions .",
    "this regime of soft hadronic interactions is a field of phenomenological models constrained with asymptotic theorems .",
    "the regge - gribov theory @xcite is based on the analycity , unitarity and crossing symmetry of the scattering amplitude and describes the interaction via exchange of trajectories related to the poles ( or cuts ) in the complex angular momentum plane .",
    "the elastic channel is treated as a shadow of many inelastic channels .",
    "the elastic amplitude is considered to be mainly imaginary and helicity conserving .",
    "phenomenological fits @xcite based on regge theory are able to describe all the hadronic and photoproduction total cross sections in the full energy range .",
    "the data are well described by the exchange of the pomeron ( @xmath14 ) and lower - lying regge meson , the reggon , trajectories .",
    "the pomeron is described in the qcd language @xcite in terms of multi - gluon exchange and point - like coupling to quarks : a color singlet two - gluon exchange with @xmath15 corresponds to the pomeron while the color singlet three - gluon @xmath16 state corresponds to the odderon @xcite . in spite of its successes",
    ", the regge theory still lacks a firm explanation on the qcd grounds .",

    "the energy range of the @xmath0 experiment is also shown .",

    "[ fig : sigel ] together with the phenomenological model @xcite predictions .",
    "the data show characteristic features : a forward peak followed by an exponential fall , a local minimum above @xmath22 @xmath6  and a secondary maximum or a broad shoulder .",
    "the position of the minimum moves toward smaller @xmath4 values with increasing energy .",
    "a similar trend is observed for @xmath10 data .",
    "however , the depth of the minimum is smaller than that seen for @xmath12 .",
    "the data are well described by the model predictions .",
    "the @xmath4 coverage of @xmath0 includes the `` diffraction dip '' region .",
    "this local minimum was explained @xcite by the interference of the exchange amplitudes .",
    "in particular , the three - gluon exchange gives a negative contribution in case of @xmath12 interaction while for @xmath10 scattering it is positive .",
    "in the small @xmath4 region the @xmath0 experiment covers also the coulomb amplitude dominated domain . since the coulomb amplitude is absolutely known then a very small @xmath4 measurement will give an absolute measurement of the accelerator luminosity and an absolute normalization of the hadronic amplitude .",
    "the understanding of the spin dependence of the scattering amplitudes at high energies and small @xmath4 is very important .",
    "it challenges the qcd since it involves its applications in the long - range , non - perturbative regime .",
    "new measurements coming from rhic will test the qcd prediction at a new level of accuracy and detail .",

    "these parameters were used to calculate the medium-@xmath4 acceptance shown in fig . [",
    "fig : medtacc ] .    the acceptance is larger than 20% for @xmath31 @xmath3  this is the interval which covers the `` diffractive dip '' region at @xmath27 gev . at larger @xmath4 values the acceptance",

    "the expected cross section is 0.001 mb/@xmath3  the detector acceptance is about 35% . at rhic luminosity @xmath33",
    "about 10@xmath34 elastic events per @xmath4-bin of 0.05 @xmath6  per day is expected which shows that running time is not a limitation .",
    "the data collection will be staged due to the experimental setup staging and the accelerator operation mode requirements .    in 2002 ,",
    "the experimental apparatus will consists of the two fully equipped stations .",
    "these stations will be placed in the rhic tunnel about 57 meters away from the interaction region . in january , it is planned to collect the data at @xmath35 gev .",

    "the useful range of the four - momentum transfer will be : @xmath36 @xmath3  with collected data it will be possible to measure the nuclear slope parameter and possibly the single spin asymmetry @xmath37 .    in 2003 , there will be four fully equipped stations used for the data taking .",
    "it is planned to run at @xmath35 gev for @xmath38 @xmath3  this run will be devoted to the study of the cni region and the energy dependence of @xmath17 , @xmath39 , @xmath19 and spin asymmetries : @xmath37 , @xmath40 .",
    "about one day of stable running is necessary to obtain the error on analysing power of @xmath41 for @xmath42 value @xmath43 .    for 2004 ,",
    "a major update of the experimental setup is foreseen .",
    "additional roman pot stations will be placed in the straight sections connecting the @xmath44 and @xmath45 magnets , see fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] .",
    "this will enable the measurements for @xmath46 @xmath3  the energy dependence of the nuclear slope , elastic differential cross section and spin observables will be investigated . also the diffractive minimum region will be studied . at luminosity @xmath47 about 200 hours of the data",
    "taking will be needed to acquire 1000 events per 0.02 @xmath6  bin around @xmath48@xmath3     investigation of the very small @xmath4 region will require a special , @xmath0 dedicated tune of the accelerator , @xmath49 m .",
    "therefore precision measurements of ratio of the real - to - imaginary part of the forward amplitude , of the total cross section for @xmath50 @xmath6   will be postponed until after 2004 .",
    "it is worth noting that the same experimental setup can be used to measure the elastic scattering of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it is also possible to extend the four - momentum region beyond 1.3 @xmath6  by adding rp stations in front of the @xmath44 magnets .",
    "the @xmath0 experiment at rhic collider has been introduced .",
    "the physics programme includes a systematic study of the spin dependent and spin independent features of the elastic proton  proton scattering in wide and mostly unexplored energy domain @xmath1 gev and for the four - momentum transfer @xmath2 @xmath6  within a single experiment",
    ". the use of the same apparatus will play a crucial role in understanding and reduction of systematic errors .",
    "elastically scattered protons will be measured with silicon detectors placed in the roman pots .",
    "new and precise measurements coming from the @xmath0 experiment will help to test the qcd in a non - perturbative regime .",
