    "the study of interconnected systems plays a significant role in the stability analysis of complex dynamics , as it allows one to establish stability of the interconnection based on properties of the less complex components . in this approach ,",
    "small - gain theorems prove to be general and advantageous tools in the study of feedback interconnections , which appear frequently in the control literature .",
    "a comprehensive overview of classical small - gain theorems involving input - output gains of linear systems can be found in @xcite .",
    "this technique was then generalized to nonlinear feedback systems in @xcite within the input - output context .",
    "the next peak level in the stability analysis of interconnections was reached based on the input - to - state stability ( iss ) framework proposed in @xcite , which unified the notions of internal and external stability .",
    "nonlinear small - gain theorems for interconnections of two iss systems were established in @xcite , and then generalized to arbitrary networks of @xmath1 dynamic systems in @xcite .",
    "a variety of nonlinear small - gain theorems were summarized in @xcite .",
    "the results described above have been developed for systems of ordinary differential equations .",
    "however , in modeling real - world phenomena one often has to consider systems consisting of both continuous and discrete dynamics .",
    "a general framework for modeling such behaviors is the hybrid systems theory @xcite . in this work",
    "we adopt the modeling framework proposed in @xcite , which proves to be general and natural from the viewpoint of lyapunov stability theory @xcite .    during recent years",
    "great efforts have been devoted to the development of small - gain theorems for interconnected hybrid systems .",
    "trajectory - based small - gain theorems for interconnections of two hybrid systems were derived in @xcite , while lyapunov - based formulations were proposed in @xcite .",
    "some of these results were extended to interconnections of @xmath1 hybrid iss systems in @xcite .",
    "a more challenging problem is the study of hybrid systems in which either the continuous or the discrete dynamics is non - iss . in this case , input - to - state stability is usually achieved under restrictions on the density of jumps ( discrete events ) such as dwell - time @xcite , average dwell - time ( adt ) @xcite and reverse average dwell - time ( radt ) @xcite . for interconnections of such hybrid systems , the small - gain theorems derived in @xcite can not be directly applied . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that one can modify the destabilizing dynamics of subsystems by adding auxiliary clocks and constructing iss lyapunov functions for the augmented subsystems that decrease both during flows and at jumps .",
    "one advantage of this method is that it can be applied even if the destabilizing dynamics are of different types ( i.e. , if in some subsystems the continuous dynamics are non - iss , while in some other ones the discrete dynamics are non - iss ) .",
    "however , due to the modification the lyapunov gains would increase exponentially w.r.t .",
    "constants in the adt / radt conditions , which restricts the applicability of this method as the enlarged gains may no longer satisfy the small - gain condition .",
    "another type of small - gain theorems has been proposed in @xcite for iss of interconnected impulsive systems with destabilizing continuous or discrete dynamics .",
    "the first step in this approach is to construct a candidate exponential iss lyapunov function for the interconnection . when the destabilizing dynamics of subsystems are of the same type ( i.e. , when the continuous dynamics of all subsystems or the discrete ones of all subsystems are iss ) , the candidate exponential iss lyapunov function obtained above can be used to establish iss of the interconnection under suitable adt / radt conditions .",
    "compared with the previous method , this construction does nt require modifications of subsystems , and hence preserves the lyapunov gains and small - gain conditions .",
    "however , this method has been developed only for impulsive systems and requires candidate exponential iss lyapunov functions for subsystems .",
    "moreover , it can not be applied to interconnections of subsystems with different types of destabilizing dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we unify the two methods above . in section  [ sec : intro_and_lyapunov ] we introduce the modeling framework and main definitions , followed by a lyapunov sufficient condition for iss of hybrid systems . in section  [ sec : interconnections_sgt ] we first prove a general small - gain theorem for @xmath1 interconnected hybrid systems based on the construction of a candidate iss lyapunov function for the interconnection , which generalizes the lyapunov small - gain theorems from @xcite . in the same section",
    "we also derive several implications of the general result , in particular , a small - gain theorem for interconnections of subsystems with the same type of destabilizing dynamics and with candidate exponential iss lyapunov functions with linear lyapunov gains . in section  [ sec : modifications ] we propose a version of the method of modifying iss lyapunov functions for subsystems from @xcite in which a smaller number of subsystems are affected ( and hence fewer lyapunov gains are enlarged ) . in section  [ sec : the_whole_perspective ] we combine the results of this work into a unified method for establishing iss of interconnected hybrid systems and conclude the paper with an outlook on future research .",
