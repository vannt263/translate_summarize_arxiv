    "in order to enhance the realism of the model , we have suggested several modifications .",
    "the primarily inspiration for this originates from the evolutionary formulation of minority game that allows agents to adapt strategy according to past experience  ref.@xcite . as a result",
    ", the co - evolutionary spin market model is proposed that imposes the self - organized formation of the stationary distributions of _ strategic variables _ constituted by the set of _ inherent fields _ and _",
    "couplings_.    the static regular lattice geometry represents perhaps one of the most unrealistic aspects of aforementioned spin model . to overcome this problem in our approach",
    "we take advantage of directed network ( graph ) of labeled nodes @xmath33 , where node @xmath34 attaches via @xmath35 directed links to its neighbors @xmath36 , @xmath37 , i.e. the graph is @xmath35-regular .",
    "the links mediate non - symmetric spin - exchange couplings @xmath38 through which the agents may exchange the game - relevant information .",
    "two outgoing links @xmath39 , @xmath40 of node @xmath34 are fixed to guarantee the network connectedness at any stage of its evolution .",
    "the dynamics of reconnections of the links @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( defined below ) then develops on the background of the quenched bidirectional loop ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "in addition , the dynamics is constrained to forbid the self - connections ( @xmath44 ) as well as the multiple connections [ @xmath45 .",
    "an important information about the network statistics can be obtained by sampling the distribution of the node degrees . for our purposes here , we redefine _ node degree _ @xmath46 as a number that accounts exceptionally for the incoming links of the node @xmath47 .    with the above topology in mind",
    ", the spin interaction is introduced via modified local field @xmath48 we see that the strategic variable @xmath49 is reminiscent to the previously introduced global term . the inclusion of the node bias @xmath50 closely resembles a random field model .",
    "it should be noted that preliminary simulations have confirmed qualitatively that the set of generated distributions is irrespective to variations in functional form of the local field .    as usual , the principles of the co - evolution are simply implementable in the frame of the local fitness as a phenotype . here , the recurrently defined local fitness @xmath51 is considered as an integrated history of the agent s spin orientations with respect to the minority @xmath52 the idea of the slowly ( strategic ) changing parameters  ref.@xcite as a background of the spin dynamics is not a new within the family of spin market models . in order to optimize the local fitness , the co - evolutionary dynamics including the hebbian and anti - hebbian learning rule , respectively , has been proposed in  ref.@xcite .",
    "the approach proposed here follows similar lines , however , the principal distinctions exist that are summarized in below :    * ( a ) * the strategies are subordinated to bak - sneppen extremal dynamics refs.@xcite ;    * ( b ) * in the present formulation we have @xmath53 instead of @xmath54 m^{(t)}$ ] suggested in  ref.@xcite .",
    "the effect of the term involving the spin difference is that agent benefits from majority / minority jumps , while the abidance in minority is paradoxically penalized .    *",
    "( c ) * the dynamical network of spin couplings is permanently rewired which mimics the social effects , where emphasis is putted on the links to the fittest nodes . generally , our approach resembles the concept of preferential attachments that comes from the core of the proposal of the barabsi and albert  ref.@xcite .",
    "recently , the interest in complex networks has been extended to the search for local rules governing to dynamics of social networks .",
    "several principles have been exploited for this purpose . as an example",
    "let us mention the network transformation due to node aging and time - dependent attachment probability  ref.@xcite .",
    "the model proposed here is however closer to paradigm of inter - agent communication across net  refs.@xcite .",
    "we have considered slow motion of _ strategic variables _ defined by the recursive cycles over the following steps :    1 .",
    "the information that leader agent labeled as @xmath55 has achieved the highest fitness @xmath56 , @xmath57 is available to all agents",
    ". clearly , the idealized and unbounded access to information resources monitoring the instant fitness of all agents is assumed .",
    "the assumption of the model is that the strategic transfer from _ leader _ to the crowd of @xmath58 followers @xmath34 , @xmath59 is carried out independently of the local network structure .",
    "the supposition about the collective action of the crowd expresses the _ bounded rationality _ of the _ followers_. in essence , all the followers believe that imitation of strategy that has been applied in the aforegoing cycle ( i.e. after 1  visit per node ) by the most successful trader @xmath55 would bring a future benefit to them .",
    "we postulated that each follower @xmath4 adapts the strategy of leader according to prescription @xmath60 the formula expresses the individual adaption differences .",
    "they are reflected by the plasticity parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 @xmath64 , @xmath65 uniformly distributed over the range @xmath66 , where @xmath67 .",

    "hereafter we summarize the main findings of simulation .",
    "the self - organization process of intermittent fluctuations of the log - price returns has been obtained by the simulation .",
    "the punctuated equilibrium of selected strategic variable is monitored in fig [ fig1 ] .",
    "the relevance of the approach for the economic modeling is demonstrated by the fat tail probability density function ( pdf ) of the log - price returns  ref.@xcite .",
    "it can be roughly characterized by the exponent @xmath0 ( fig.[fig2 ] ) . at this moment , it is rather illustrative to mention the empirical value @xmath106 corresponding to 1-day period of taq database  ref.@xcite .",
    "it has been checked numerically that distribution may vary with the bounding of strategic space and chosen topology ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the generalization proposed herein covers not only power - law but also nearly exponential or gaussian - like distributions .    in fig.[fig3 ] the emergence of the long market memory",
    "is demonstrated by calculating the autocorrelation of volatility of the log - price returns .",
    "the empirical slopes @xmath107  ref.@xcite and @xmath108  ref.@xcite should be mentioned in this context .",
    "as it turns out from our simulation , the co - evolution represents one of the potential mechanisms responsible for the power - law decay .",
    "more specifically , we have shown the inclusion of _ extremal dynamics and adaptivity _ can cure the notorious exponential decay problem of the spin market models .",
    "even more interestingly , only the _ simultaneous exploiting of both mentioned dynamical principles can result in nontrivial autocorrelations_. within the spin market models , an alternative explanation to our has been proposed only recently  ref.@xcite . in the quoted work ,",
    "the power - law decay is kept for three - state potts model where zero spin state encodes the inactive ( waiting ) state of the trader .    in the stationary regime",
    "the self - organized reconstruction yields network of the broad - scale distributed degrees of nodes  ( see fig.[fig5 ] ) . for the upper part of the power - law range we have estimated an exponent @xmath109 .",
    "the result is quite encouraging since the exponent falls within the range typical for the social networks .",
    "here we report on a comparison the exponents of several cooperative social networks : the value @xmath110 ref .",
    "@xcite is obtained by collecting the e - mal addresses , the exponent @xmath111 belongs to the coauthorship network ref .",
    "@xcite whereas @xmath112 characterizes the phone - call network ref .",
    "similarly as in  ref.@xcite , the network topology can be characterized by the clustering coefficient @xmath113 or its spatial - temporal mean @xmath114 . for",
    "directed network we have used slightly modified formula @xmath115 , where @xmath116 stands for the number of links between the neighbors of some node @xmath4 . in this formula , @xmath117 represents the maximum number of links going from @xmath118 to @xmath119 and vice versa .",
    "it should be noted that the conventional factor @xmath120 absents in the definition since the links are directed . as usual , it is meaningful to compare the mean clustering coefficients of two simulated network regimes . for randomly attached nodes [ instead of selection declared by eq.([rulenetw1 ] ) ] the simulation results in @xmath121 , while @xmath122 stems from the preference of @xmath55 , and thus the enhancement of clustering is confirmed by the ratio @xmath123 .",
    "the generalized version of the spin market model has been suggested and investigated numerically . in the approach we used the static couplings",
    "are adjusted by an instant local fitness that drives the co - evolutionary competitive changes .",
    "the socially relevant feature of the approach is slowly evolving topology of the spin - spin interaction network as a substrate for fast buy - sell spin decisions .",
    "the power - law distributions have been uncovered as an attributes of the universality caused by the extremal dynamics .",
    "our results suggest hypothesis that slowly varying strategic variables can cause an emergence of the long memory effect that is symptomatic for the real markets .",
    "the universality manifests itself in a broad - scale node degree distribution , however , _",
    "the network evolution does not necessary imply the power - law decay of volatility_. even the static net enough to gain the power - law decay or flat - tailed pdf s .",
    "numerous examples of the model applicability can be found outside the field of econophysics .",
    "for instance , the coevolutionary model opens the possibility of the optimization of the spin lattice and related systems in the manner of  ref.@xcite .",
    "the finite - size scaling analysis , the small world behaviour and the aspect of modularity are only a few examples of issues that remain to be analyzed in the complementary studies ."
