    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) is confirmed by a lot of astrophysical observations . however , there is no candidate in the standard model ( sm ) particle content .",
    "one of properties required for dm is a long lifetime which should be longer than the age of our universe . to realize this stability",
    ", an additional symmetry should be exist .",
    "for example , when the dm particle has odd parity and others do even parity under a @xmath4 symmetry , the dm particle can be stable .",
    "recent analyses of the observation of x - ray from the perseus galaxy clusters and the andromeda galaxy by the xmm - newton observatory reported an unknown x - ray line spectrum around @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the origin of this line can not be explained by astrophysical phenomena so far .",
    "therefore , we try to explain the x - ray line spectrum in the particle physics . an interesting explanation is given by decay of a light dm particle .",
    "after these announcements , a lot of articles @xcite-@xcite in which dm decays into a photon have been researched .",
    "one attractive candidate for a decaying dm is the right - handed neutrino , @xmath5 , with mass around @xmath6 . in this scenario ,",
    "the experiments show the mixing angle between left- and right - handed neutrinos , @xmath7 , to be @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that the right - handed neutrinos can generate the tiny neutrino masses through the type - i seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian for the seesaw mechanism is described as @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are lepton and higgs doublets , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath13 is the majorana mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos . @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the flavor of left - handed leptons and right - handed neutrinos , respectively .",
    "if the right - handed neutrinos have a large mass hierarchy , it can explain several issues such as the tiny neutrino masses , dm , and baryon asymmetry of the universe simultaneously ( _ e.g. _ see  @xcite ) .",
    "such a hierarchical structure among the majorana masses can be realized by _",
    "e.g. , _ the froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite , the split seesaw mechanism @xcite , a lepton flavor symmetry  @xcite , an extra - dimensional extension  @xcite and an extended b - l structure  @xcite , and so on .",
    "however , once the right - handed neutrino with the mass of order kev gives the solar or atmospheric neutrino mass scale through the type - i seesaw mechanism , the size of left - right mixing angle can not be explained .",
    "after breaking the electroweak symmetry , we have the dirac mass term , @xmath16 with @xmath17 , and the majorana mass term .",
    "the seesaw mechanism can explain the tiny neutrino masses as @xmath18 with @xmath19 even under hierarchical mass spectra of majorana masses .",
    "the mixing angle between the left- and right - handed neutrinos is given by @xmath20 .",
    "when the lightest majorana mass is of order @xmath21 , the seesaw relation induces the left - right mixing angle as @xmath22 it is worth noting that the suitable magnitude of the mixing angle , @xmath23 , never achieves unless giving up the seesaw relation .",
    "it is because a tiny neutrino yukawa couplings only for the first generation with the left - right mixing angle , @xmath23 induces the mass scale of @xmath24 , which is much smaller than the atmospheric neutrino mass scale , @xmath19 .    in this work , we suggest a new possibility to realize the suitable left - right mixing due to the deviation from the seesaw relation by an extending sm .",
    "we introduce a dm - philic higgs field , @xmath25 , which constitutes a yukawa interaction of dm with ordinary sm fields .",
    "the results from x - ray observation experiments indicate the existence of an unknown particle which has a mass around @xmath6 .",
    "if it is a right - handed neutrino , it should not contribute to the active neutrino mass scale through the seesaw relation due to its tiny mass and the suitable mixing angle as discussed above .",
    "such property could imply the right - handed neutrino dm ( rh@xmath26 dm ) has a different interaction from other particles .",
    "we introduce an extra field : a rh@xmath26dm - philic higgs boson , @xmath25 .    by introducing @xmath25 ,",
    "the relevant lagrangian is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and we suppose that @xmath29 at this moment .",
    "therefore , we can realize a small mixing of @xmath30 by taking small vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath31 . under this simple setup",
    ", the mixing angle can be represented as @xmath32 where the third and fourth equalities are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fn ] ) .",
    "one can see that when @xmath33 is @xmath34 , the observed x - ray flux can be explained . therefore , @xmath31 is needed to be @xmath35 .",
    "instinctively , the deviation from the seesaw formula is realized by the small value of @xmath31 rather than a fine - tuning of coupling constants .",
    "this is our main idea and this possibility is really simple .      here",
    ", we show an example of realistic model .",
    "the charge assignment of each field is summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : assign ] .",
    ".the charge assignments for each field .",
    "@xmath36 is an arbitrary natural number . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also introduce gauged @xmath37 which is responsible not only for the generation of the majorana masses of rh@xmath26s but also the dm production .",
    "two global symmetries @xmath38 and @xmath4 provide the sufficient mass hierarchy and couplings between @xmath30 and others . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are spontaneously broken by a b@xmath39l higgs boson , @xmath40 and another higgs boson , @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "those breaking scales are denoted as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the lagrangian under these symmetries are given as @xmath44 where @xmath45 contains the terms under the sm gauge symmetries , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are dimension - less coupling constants , and @xmath48 represents a cutoff scale .",
    "next , we consider the higgs potential . for the realistic model ,",
    "the small magnitude of @xmath31 is essential .",
    "we show the validity of this point below .",
    "the corresponding higgs potential of this model is @xmath49 \\,,\\label{v}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 terms break @xmath4 symmetry softly .",
    "thus , the lightest rh@xmath26 becomes dm which can decay .",
    "a stationary condition @xmath51 gives @xmath52 where we assume @xmath53 .",
    "note that a tiny value of @xmath31 can be realized when @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vdm ] ) .    after",
    "each scalar field takes its vev , the dirac and majorana mass matrices can be written as @xmath55 the hierarchical structure of the majorana masses as @xmath29 and the different coupling property in the dirac mass term are realized .",
    "the seesaw mechanism provides the mass matrix for the active neutrinos , @xmath56 , as @xmath57 where @xmath58 are obtained by the diagonalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : majorana ] ) .",
    "@xmath56 can be diagonalized by the so - called mns matrix , @xmath59 , as @xmath60 . roughly speaking",
    ", the order of @xmath61 can be estimated in the normal mass ordering case as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is of @xmath64 which corresponds to the atmospheric neutrino mass scale and the squared difference between @xmath65 and @xmath66 explains the solar mass - squared difference .",
    "thus , the @xmath37 breaking scale can be determined as @xmath67 .",
    "note that we can reproduce the observed mixing angles in the mns matrix by taking proper values of neutrino yukawa couplings , @xmath68 .",
    "we are at the position to investigate suitable model parameters by cosmological observations .",
    "we assume that all of the dimension - less couping constants are unity just for simplicity and the cutoff scale is the reduced planck scale , @xmath69 .",
    "firstly , we estimate the breaking scale of the extra symmetries by the lightest right - handed neutrino mass , @xmath70 , which is given by eq.([eq : majorana ] ) as @xmath71 the left - right mixing angle of the neutrinos is estimated as @xmath72 from the observations , each value is constrained as @xcite @xmath73 and here , we fix these as @xmath74 and @xmath75 which are the best fit values of the experiments .",
    "we first mention to the scale of @xmath31 .",
    "one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixing ] ) by the seesaw neutrino mass , @xmath76 , as @xmath77 this relation is free from the scale of @xmath43 and the charge @xmath36 . and , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixing ] ) determines @xmath31 as @xmath78 this value can be obtained when @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vdm ] ) .    meanwhile , the remaining ambiguities of this model are the values of @xmath43 and @xmath36 .",
    "these values are also determined by the constraint of the dm mass .",
    "the correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath36 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n - vfn ] .    for example , when @xmath80 , the breaking scale of @xmath38 should be @xmath81 to explain dm properties .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath36 becomes large , the ordinary froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite can work for generating the fermion mass hierarchy without any fine - tuning of the coupling constants .",
    "we would like to give a brief comment on the production mechanism of dm .",
    "one simple production mechanism is the so - called dodelson - widrow mechanism @xcite in which rh@xmath26 dm is produced via the mixing after the big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , the required magnitude of the mixing angle for this mechanism is much larger than the experimental bound .",
    "thus , we need to consider other possibilities .",
    "one possibility is the production via the b - l gauge boson s - channel exchange @xcite . in this case , the relic abundance is evaluated as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the dimensionless hubble parameter , and @xmath84 denotes the reheating temperature of the universe .",
    "when we adopt the thermal production , the data from the lyman-@xmath85 forest @xcite-@xcite should be taken into account .",
    "however , this bound is relaxed by the late time entropy dilution  @xcite .",
    "the total amount of thermal abundance seems to be smaller than eq .",
    "( [ eq : dm_abun ] ) , but we can adjust the abundance by controlling the reheating temperature . although the sufficient amount of dm can also be explained in our setup , we skip the detailed estimation here . moreover , in this setup",
    ", we can also explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via the so - called leptogenesis scenario @xcite by non - thermal decay of the second lightest right - handed neutrino , @xmath86 .",
    "the lightest one is a candidate for dm as discussed above and the other right - handed neutrinos can not decay into this lightest right - handed neutrino due to the difference of the @xmath4 charge shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : assign ] .",
    "such setup is the same as the split seesaw case @xcite .",
    "lastly , we would like to add a comment on the detectability of rh@xmath26dm - philic higgs boson , @xmath25 . @xmath25",
    "pair production through the decay of @xmath12 is possible when the mass of @xmath25 is less than the half of the sm higgs boson mass . in this case",
    ", the invisible decay of the higgs boson might be seen in the collider experiment depending on the strength of the portal couplings @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath25 is hardly produced because of its odd parity under @xmath4 symmetry with @xmath87 .",
    "detailed quantitative estimation is the future works at the moment .",
    "we have suggested a new model in which the right - handed neutrino dark matter is naturally included .",
    "it can explain the recently observed @xmath1 x - ray signal by the xmm - newton observatory .",
    "one of the most impressive features of our model is the existence of the dark matter - philic higgs field , @xmath25 .",
    "the smallness of the left - right mixing angle of the lightest neutrinos is ensured by the smallness of the vacuum expectation value of this dark matter - philic higgs field . on the other hand ,",
    "the smallness of the mass of the dark matter can be clearly understood by the froggatt - nielsen mechanism .",
    "we have shown that the cosmological observations fix the scale of @xmath31 as @xmath2 and the intriguing point is that the uncertainty of this model to realize the dm mass is not essential to determine this scale .",
