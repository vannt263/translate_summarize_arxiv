    "the smallest gauge group which implements the hypothesis of the left - right symmetry of weak interactions is @xcite    @xmath1    this gauge group can be understood as a second step ( after the sm ) in unifying fundamental interactions .",
    "the main feature of the model is the restoration of both the quark - lepton and parity symmetry . at the same time",
    "the @xmath2 generator gets its physical interpretation as the b - l quantum number .",
    "other phenomena which are investigated are connected with small masses of light neutrinos , charge quantization , understanding of cp violation in the quark sector , the strong cp problem , baryogenesis , etc . until present days",
    "literally hundreds of papers have been devoted to these concepts and their theoretical and phenomenological consequences .",
    "an extended literature on the subject can be found e.g. in the introduction of @xcite .",
    "the model is baroque with many new particles of different types .",
    "new neutral leptons , charged and neutral gauge bosons , neutral and charged higgs particles appear .",
    "there are many different versions of the lr models with the same or different left and right gauge couplings @xmath3 and specific higgs - sector representations .",
    "we chose the model with @xmath4 and a higgs representation with a bidoublet @xmath5 and two ( left and right ) triplets @xmath6 .",
    "we also assume that the vev of the left - handed triplet @xmath7 vanishes , @xmath8 and the cp symmetry is violated only by complex phases in quark and lepton mixing matrices .",
    "we call this model the minimal left - right symmetric model ( mlrm ) .",
    "our aim is to show that constraints on the heavy sector of the model from muon decay at tree and one loop levels are completely different .",
    "first we will discuss tree - level muon decay .",
    "bounds on @xmath9 ( the additional charged gauge boson mass ) from this tree level process are cited permanently by pdg @xcite .",
    "we view the situation in the following way : a consistent model gives very weak limits on charged current parameters from the tree level muon decay .",
    "as quite impressive bounds derived from muon decay still persist through the succeeding pdg journals , we found it worth to clarify the case .",
    "then we go to the one - loop level results .",
    "we end up with conclusions and outlook .      as a low energy process , with a momentum transfer small relative to the involved gauge boson mass",
    ", the muon decay can be conveniently described by a four - fermion interaction .",
    "for very small neutrino masses , neglecting the mixing between them , the lagrangian can be written in the form    @xmath10    where ( @xmath11 ) : @xmath12 @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the mixing between the charged gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "obviously , the @xmath15 , @xmath16 limit leads to the sm result , with a purely left - handed interaction .",
    "to have neutrino mixings properly included , we have to write : @xmath17 where : @xmath18    the matrices @xmath19 build up the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath20 , which can be approximated to be @xcite    @xmath21    @xmath22 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix which emerges from vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) in the bidoublet higgs - sector and @xmath23 stands for diagonal elements of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath24 connected with the right handed triplet higgs representation ( for details see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the sum over @xmath25 and @xmath26 is understood , with both states light .",
    "@xmath27 contains the sum over at least one heavy neutrino and for our purposes is irrelevant .",
    "we can see that apart from a pure left - handed term @xmath28 , all others get extra damping factors connected with the @xmath29 mixing matrix of light - heavy neutrinos being at most @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the lightest of heavy neutrinos ( @xmath32 ) . in what follows",
    "we consider @xmath33 gev .",
    "in terms of the four - fermion interaction we can find @xcite : @xmath34    using relations @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we have :    @xmath37    to make the fitting procedure of the @xmath14 and @xmath38 parameters possible at all at the tree - level , we have to naively rely on sm corrections , we thus take @xcite @xmath39 gev , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the result of the fit is plotted in fig .  [ beta ] .    although @xmath42 looks fine , with the most optimistic bound on @xmath14 below 0.1 @xcite , we get @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 gev .",
    "let us finally note that if we only had light neutrinos ( eq .  [ 1l ] ) then much better bounds on @xmath9 would be available @xcite .",
    "let us summarize . in a realistic lr model ( i.e. when the mixing of heavy majorana neutrinos is taken into account ) ,",
    "the tree - level diagrams for the muon decay give no interesting bounds on @xmath38 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , as it will be clear in the next section , the procedure we have used , where the sm values @xmath45 and @xmath46 have been taken into account , is wrong .",
    "oblique radiative corrections to this process have been considered in the frame of the mlrm in @xcite .",
    "further analysis has been given in @xcite .",
    "though the model has more free parameters ( see e.g. @xcite ) , namely two gauge coplings @xmath47 and @xmath48 altogether with three vevs : @xmath49 ( connected with the bidoublet @xmath5 ) and @xmath50 ( connected with the right handed triplet @xmath51 ) , there are simultaneously more physical quantities ( @xmath52 , ) and unambiguous relations among them can be found ( @xmath53 mapping ) .",
    "this enables us to find ( analogous to the sm ) the counterterm of the sine squared of the weinberg angle as function of masses and their counterterms ) the situation would be quite different : @xmath46 would not be predictable in terms of gauge boson masses and their counter terms ) , but would have to be tuned to experimental data ) . ]",
    "@xmath54    let us note that the denominator @xmath55 is proportional to the scale of the right sector @xmath50",
    "@xmath56 + @xmath57 exhibits a different structure from the sm case .    in figs .",
    "[ delta_r]-[top ] the contributions to the @xmath45 parameter defined as , @xmath45 is modified to account for a different definition of the weinberg angle in both models @xcite and the relation @xmath58 is used .",
    "let us add that not only @xmath59 is different in lr and sm models , @xmath60 has turned out to be a finite quantity @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath61    are given .",
    "@xmath62 denotes the complete vertex , box and external line corrections within the mlrm .",
    "if we parametrize the higgs scalar masses by ( no fine - tuning in the higgs potential @xcite ) @xmath63    then we can observe from fig .",
    "[ delta_r ] that the experimental data on the muon decay lifetime can not be accomodated .",
    "it is possible , however , if all heavy higgs particle masses are equal ( see fig .  [ mn ] ) .",
    "line ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ delta_r ] shows the results when heavy neutrino masses follow from the maximal yukawa coupling connected with right - handed triplet representation @xmath64 , @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath66 the perturbative theory breaks , which can be seen if the box diagrams are considered @xcite . in the model under investigation",
    "the light - heavy neutrino mixing has been neglected and the light - heavy gauge boson mixing angle @xmath14 is neglected .",
    "these assumptions are well motivated phenomenologically @xcite . fig .",
    "[ top ] shows explicitly that @xmath45 strongly depends on the relation between @xmath67 and @xmath50 .",
    "this means that @xmath67 can not be predicted in the mlrm model without knowledge of the @xmath50 scale and furthermore that for larger @xmath50 the dependence will lead only to a very crude bound .",
    "the results shown here ( for details , see @xcite ) justify again our statements considered in @xcite .",
    "it has been concluded there , that the only sensible way to confront a model beyond the sm with the experimental data is to renormalize it self - consistently as it does not necessarily embed the sm structure of radiative corrections .",
    "if this is not done , parameters which depend strongly on quantum effects should be left free in fits , though essential physics is lost in this way .",
    "in lr models there are several new extra parameters ( e.g. mixing angles in the gauge sector , the @xmath68 gauge coupling ) along with quite a lot of new particles and interactions .",
    "these cause that the model is a very good theoretical lab for examining many phenomenological problems and issues of fundamental interactions .",
    "however , the freedom of parameter space connected with the extra sector is not unlimited , moreover , sometimes the model can be even more restricted than the sm alone .",
    "this seems to be particularly true when processes are considered at the loop level . though we have restricted ourselves to the case of the minimal lr model ,",
    "the results already show that fine - tuning of the heavy sector parameters must be done to recover experimental data .",
    "this is in our opinion the main direction of future investigations which has certainly not been fully exploited in the past @xcite .",
