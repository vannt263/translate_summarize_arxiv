    "we obtained @xmath101 from the gate capacitance extracted from the coulomb diamond at the base temperature and the coulomb peak ( cp ) spacing at a temperature sufficiently high that the kondo effect is so weak that the renormalization of the charging energy is negligible .",

    "figure [ fig : comp ] shows transmission phase and amplitude calculated numerically by a two - level anderson model at @xmath42 for different signs of @xmath103 . for @xmath95 , a singular point called _ transmission zero _ @xcite appears , which leads to a @xmath3-phase lapse and zero transmission amplitude when the fermi level lies symmetrically between the two different levels [ fig .",
    "[ fig : comp](a ) ] . on the other hand for @xmath104",
    ", there is no such singular point and the phase smoothly evolves between two different levels [ fig . [ fig : comp](b ) ] .",
    "we assume from the current around the cps shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) of the main paper the relative sign between the kondo level ( governing the kondo valley in the conductance ) and the next - higher ( next - lower ) levels at more positive ( negative ) @xmath72 is @xmath105 . for our two - level anderson model calculations ,",
    "we therefore focus on the phase evolution of either a lower kondo level with @xmath95 , or an upper kondo level with @xmath104 for comparison with the experimental data .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the asymmetry of the phase evolution in the weak kondo regime of the experiment [ fig .",
    "3(d ) in the main paper ] .    here",
    "we describe the fitting procedure for @xmath95 , whose results are presented in the main paper . to determine the parameters used in fig .",
    "3(f ) , we first fitted the data of fig .",
    "3(c ) , where we can safely assume that the electron temperature is comparable to the fridge temperature of 110 mk , i.e. @xmath106 .",
    "we then tune only fitting parameters , @xmath41 and @xmath44 .",
    "to capture the most important feature of the phase evolution , we compared experimental data and calculations for the phase slope around the middle of the kondo valley , @xmath107 . to fit the experimental data , @xmath44 has to be large enough compared to @xmath41 ( i.e. @xmath108 ) and we confirmed numerically that the precise value of @xmath44 only plays a minor role for the phase behavior , as long as @xmath109 .",
    "we therefore fixed @xmath44 to @xmath110 .",
    "note that experimentally @xmath44 can be evaluated via the excitation spectra .",
    "however when @xmath41 is large enough to observe the kondo effect , it is hard to find excited states and a precise evaluation of @xmath44 is not possible . by varying @xmath41 as a single fitting parameter , we obtained @xmath111 . with these parameters , @xmath1 is determined to be approximately @xmath112 mk @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize that a different choice of @xmath44 does not lead to a significant change in @xmath1 , instead , it leads to a slightly different value of @xmath41 .",
    "in such a way a very similar @xmath1 value is obtained .",
    "the phase evolution at this temperature therefore allows for a precise evaluation of @xmath1 , with an uncertainty of @xmath113 .",
    "to determine the parameters used in fig .",
    "3(e ) , we proceeded as follows : with @xmath114 and @xmath115 , temperature is then lowered as a fitting parameter to fit the phase curve in fig .",
    "we note that for these @xmath116 values the @xmath0 plateau has still a finite and temperature dependent slope , even at zero temperature .",
    "this allows for a relatively precise determination of the electron temperature of about 40 mk , somewhat higher than the fridge base temperature , but in good agreement with former measurements on 2degs in the same electromagnetic environment @xcite .",
    "finally , to determine the parameters used in fig .",
    "3(g ) , we proceeded as follows : with @xmath117 and @xmath115 , @xmath41 is varied to fit the data in fig .",
    "the data is fit best for @xmath118 .",
    "the determination of the exact kondo temperature in this weak kondo regime is more delicate as the exponential dependence on @xmath116 leads to relatively large uncertainties .",
    "nevertheless we estimate @xmath1 to be more than 30 times smaller than the actual electron temperature .",
    "finally let us mention that the values for @xmath41 extracted from the nrg fitting are much smaller than if one would take simply the width of the cps ( in our case @xmath119 compared to @xmath120 ) .",
    "the asymmetry in the phase evolution in fig .",
    "3(g ) around @xmath121 originates from the influence of the nearby level and reflects the orbital parity , @xmath122 .",
    "we also performed the same fitting procedure with the other choice of sign , @xmath123 , which led to very similar parameters .",
    "for both fitting procedures we get remarkable agreement between the experimental data and the nrg calculations for the phase evolution .",
    "the @xmath0-phase shift persisting up to @xmath1 [ fig .",
    "3(b ) ] clearly indicates that coherent current flows through the kondo resonance once a localized spin is formed in the quantum dot for @xmath124 .",
    "compared to the phase , agreement between the current @xmath17 in the experiment and the conductance @xmath125 in the calculations is not as good .",
    "this may arise from several reasons : one possibility is that in our calculation we did not include left - right asymmetry of the tunnel coupling between the leads and the quantum dot whereas for the actual quantum dot this asymmetry exists .",
    "another possible reason is that in the experiment there is a linear background from the upper path of the interferometer whereas the calculated conductance @xmath125 does not contain such a contribution .    in the gate voltage region ( @xmath72 )",
    "in which the current @xmath17 shows the coulomb blockade peak on the right , the phase increases towards one with increasing @xmath72 occurs somewhat sooner ( relative to the position of the cp ) for the experimental data in fig .",
    "3(b ) and 3(c ) than for the nrg calculations in fig .",
    "3(e ) and 3(f ) .",
    "this deviation between experiment and theory in the tails of the phase curves may be due to the fact that we experimentally extract the phase from the _ coherent _ part of the current whereas the _ total _ current @xmath17 that is plotted in figs .",
    "3(b ) - 3(d ) also contains the incoherent part . in this context , further theoretical studies are necessary .",
    "as briefly pointed out in the introductory paragraph , earlier measurements have attempted to observe the theoretically predicted transmission phase shift of @xmath0 in the kondo regime when scanning through two successive cps . in the pioneering experiment of ji et al .",
    "@xcite , however , _",
    " the total accumulated phase as the two spin - degenerate levels cross the fermi energy in the leads is nearly 2@xmath3 with a phase shift @xmath3 in the kondo valley \" _ in contradiction with kondo theory . in a followup experiment @xcite , where the quantum dot was tuned into the unitary limit , an _  even more peculiar and unexpected behavior \" _ was found . _",
    " the transmission phase was observed to evolve almost linearly over a range of about @xmath4 when the fermi energy was scanned through a spin degenerate energy level of the qd \" _ and from these results it was suggested _  that a full explanation of the kondo effect may go beyond the framework of the anderson model.\"_.    in a more recent experiment , the same group @xcite claim to have observed the theoretically predicted @xmath0-phase shift in the kondo regime @xcite .",
    "however , in our opinion the published data do not support this claim , as we now explain .",
    "the puzzling feature of this experiment is the fact , that the transmission phase shift of @xmath0 is observed in the kondo valley for temperatures much larger than the kondo temperature and that this @xmath0 transmission phase shift persists over the entire kondo valley , that is when moving away from the center of the kondo valley towards the cps , the @xmath0 phase shift is unchanged as seen in fig . 3 of ref .",
    "both of these observations are in contradiction with theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , kondo theory predicts that the total phase shift across two cps is @xmath3 and the appearance of a @xmath0 plateau around the center of the kondo valley for @xmath6 .",
    "this @xmath0 plateau is a property of the strong - coupling fixed point and the accompanying fermi - liquid regime of the kondo model , i.e. of the regime @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , the fermi - liquid regime is limited to @xmath127 , but the @xmath0 plateau was found to persist to about @xmath128 @xcite . on the other hand , the plateau will disappear for @xmath129 as expected within kondo theory and demonstrated in the present work . for temperatures above the kondo temperature , the phase shift is enhanced on one side of the center of the coulomb valley while it is decreased on the other side of the coulomb valley .",
    "such a feature is indeed observed in fig .",
    "4 of ref @xcite .",
    "when changing @xmath41 ( which is equivalent to changing the kondo temperature ) , the phase shift very close to the left cp starts to climb well above @xmath0 while it starts to fall well below @xmath0 close to the right cp . in the center between the two cps",
    "no data is shown due to too small signal to noise ratio . carefully inspecting fig .",
    "@xcite , one actually sees a very similar tendency : the phase very close to the left cp climbs above @xmath0 just before the conductance drops close to zero . a similar , but",
    "opposite tendency is seen close to the right cp where the phase drops below @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the almost unchanged @xmath0 plateau in the entire region between the two cps is very surprising as the data of ref .",
    "@xcite does not show any kondo signature near the center of the kondo valley such as the zero bias anomaly or a logarithmic increase of the conductance when decreasing temperature .",
    "also the fact that the conductance is close to zero in the _ entire _ kondo valley makes a reliable evaluation of the phase impossible . comparing the phase data of fig .",
    "@xcite with fig .",
    "3d of our manuscript , one has the impression that the phase data outside the cps , where still a good signal noise ratio is achieved due to sufficient conductance , is in line with our findings .",
    "the phase climbs above @xmath0 close to the left cp while it falls below @xmath0 close to the right cp .",
    "such a behavior is indeed expected for a temperature regime ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "only the unchanged @xmath0 plateau in the kondo valley of ref .",
    "@xcite seems to be inconsistent with kondo theory .",
    "the difficulty of such transmission phase measurements lies in the fact that the contribution of multipath interferences is very hard to determine .",
    "usually this is done by checking whether the phase shifts smoothly when moving one of the side gates of the interferometer .",
    "this indeed verifies whether the phase rigidity is lifted but does not tell whether multi path contribution are suppressed . for standard",
    "ab interferometers , this can only be checked from the harmonic content of the fourier spectrum , which however is a very insensitive method .",
    "the important advantage of our interferometer is that we can directly evaluate the contribution of multiple paths .",
    "this can be done by verifying the antiphase oscillations of the two output currents .",
    "our experiment therefore constitutes a _ true _ two - path interferometer .",
    "the high quality data in the kondo regime allows us to perform a detailed and quantitative analysis that covers a temperature range from @xmath126 to @xmath129 and is consistent with theory , providing a direct evidence of the @xmath0-phase shift and the screened singlet ground state ."

    "<S> as we do not reach the unitary limit , @xmath1 can not be determined with high precision from this temperature dependence of the conductance , but we find an upper bound of approximately @xmath36 for the kondo temperature at the valley center . </S>",

    "<S> was then measured by opening the left tunnel gate @xmath12 , and recording the ab oscillations for different plunger gate voltages @xmath13 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kondophase](a ) . in this experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the energy scale of the magnetic field was lower than that of the temperature , so that spin was not resolved @xcite ; however , we see clear signatures of the kondo effect . </S>",
    "<S> the visibility of our ab oscillations is sufficiently large to reveal , even in the raw data , a clear phase shift of approximately @xmath0 in the kondo valley , as indicated by the dotted lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kondophase](a ) . to reveal the phase shift across the cps </S>",
    "<S> even more clearly , we performed a complex fft as described above . the obtained transmission phase is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kondophase](b ) , together with @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> a total phase shift of @xmath3 when scanning through the two successive cps is observed and a clear plateau appears at @xmath0 in the kondo valley . </S>",
    "<S> this result contrasts with the phase shift across a cp without kondo correlation . </S>",
    "<S> although the conductance does not reach the unitary limit , the transmission phase shift in the kondo valley already shows the @xmath0-phase shift , which is consistent with theoretical predictions that the @xmath0-phase shift survives for temperature as large as @xmath37 @xcite .    when increasing the temperature to approximately @xmath38 mk , the kondo correlations are reduced ( @xmath39 ) and the behavior of the transmission phase is slightly altered . </S>",
    "<S> the phase climbs slightly above @xmath0 before decreasing slightly , forming an @xmath40-shape [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kondophase](c ) ] in the kondo valley . to further reduce the kondo correlations , we reduced the coupling energy @xmath41 by suitably tuning @xmath33 , @xmath13 , @xmath34 , which lowers the kondo temperature [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kondophase](d ) ] , thus reaching a regime where @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> in this regime , the @xmath40-shaped structure of the phase evolution is more pronounced and becomes asymmetric with respect to the valley center and the value @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that by further reducing the kondo correlations the phase behavior across each cp would approach that observed for cps without kondo correlation . </S>",
    "<S> these results differ strikingly from the observation of ref .  , where a @xmath0-phase shift has been reported for a regime where @xmath42 ( see ref .  ) .    to further corroborate our findings we performed numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculations of the conductance as well as of the transmission phase . </S>",
    "<S> we found that even when the single level spacing @xmath44 is larger than the coupling energy @xmath41 , the contribution from multiple levels in the dot plays an important role for the phase behavior at @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account only a single level results in a phase evolution , which is symmetric with respect to the center of the kondo valley , contrary to our experimental findings [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kondophase](d ) ] . in order to accurately reproduce the experimental phase data </S>",
    "<S> , we therefore employed a two - level anderson model ( see ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is crucial to choose correctly the relative sign of the tunnel - coupling coefficients [ i.e. ,  @xmath45 for fitting the data of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kondophase](d ) , since this sign characterizes the influence of the nearby orbital level on the phase evolution . </S>",
    "<S> fitting the predicted phase evolution to the one observed experimentally ( see ref .  ) </S>",
    "<S> allows us to estimate the qd parameters , such as @xmath41 and @xmath44 , with good precision ( note that these are not easily accessible only from the measured conductance data , due to renormalization of the cps by the kondo effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the slope of the phase in the kondo valley in fig .  [ fig : kondophase](c ) allows us to precisely evaluate the kondo temperature at the valley center to @xmath46 mk for figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kondophase](b ) and [ fig : kondophase](c ) . from the temperature evolution of the @xmath0 plateau , which is most prominent close to @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to evaluate the actual electron temperature to @xmath47 mk , consistent with previous measurements in the same electromagnetic environment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most important finding , however , is the fact that the @xmath0-phase shift persists up to a temperature of @xmath1 and then evolves into an @xmath40 shape at higher temperatures , which is extremely well captured by the nrg calculations .    in summary , our measurements show that the transmission phase through a kondo qd is @xmath0 up to temperatures of the order of @xmath1 , in full agreement with theoretical expectations . </S>",
    "<S> the key new ingredient underlying this result is the use of a novel ab interferometer design that can be fine - tuned to reliably exclude the contributions of paths traversing the interferometer multiple times . </S>",
    "<S> this new design , in combination with detailed theoretical calculations for a two - level anderson model , allowed us to obtain a detailed and consistent understanding of the behavior of the kondo phase shift .    </S>",
