    "the multifractal properties associated with the infinite percolation clusters at the percolation threshold @xmath1 is considered in this paper . in ordinary percolation ( op)@xcite ,",
    "a cluster is generated by occupying a lattice site randomly with a probability @xmath2 or remains empty with a probability @xmath3 .",
    "each site of a percolation cluster then has two states , occupied or empty .",
    "the average @xmath4 moments of the cluster size distribution of percolation clusters are linearly dependent on the moment @xmath4 and described by a single fractal dimension @xmath5@xcite . in order to study the multifractal aspects of percolation clusters , usually",
    ", a current distribution@xcite or a random walker@xcite is introduced . however , in the presence of rotational constraint on the percolation model , an occupied site has always a direction associated with it and a site can be re - occupied from different directions",
    ". a site can be occupied at most @xmath6 times from @xmath6 different directions on a given lattice with coordination number @xmath6 .",
    "there are two such well studied rotational percolation models exists , spiral percolation sp@xcite and directed spiral percolation@xcite . in these models , a state variable @xmath0 then can be assigned to each lattice site and whose value will correspond to the number of times a site is visited during the growth of the cluster .",
    "the value of @xmath0 then can change from @xmath7 to @xmath8 on a square lattice and @xmath7 to @xmath9 on a triangular lattice for sp and dsp models whereas it has only two states @xmath10 and @xmath7 in case of op . in this paper , a new methodology",
    "is proposed to study the percolation transition in terms of the state variable @xmath0 .",
    "studying the physical properties associated with the state variable @xmath0 , the percolation transition is possible to establish at the same percolation threshold @xmath1 defined geometrically .",
    "the spanning clusters at @xmath11 are fractal .",
    "distribution of @xmath0 on the fractal substrate is very similar to mass distribution on a geometrical support usually taken for multifractal study@xcite . in order to explore the multifractal aspects of the spanning percolation clusters in these rotationally constrained percolation models at @xmath11",
    ", it is now possible to define a suitable multifractal measure in terms of @xmath0 . in this way , one does not need to introduce any other external agency like electric current or random walker in the model as it is usually done in the case of op clusters .",
    "the variable @xmath0 is inbuilt in the rotational models and represents an inherent property of sp and dsp .",
    "it is found that the exponents associated with the @xmath4 moments of the measure defined in terms of @xmath0 are not limited by any linear dependence on the moment @xmath4 for the rotational percolation models .",
    "it then indicates that the measure has multifractal character .    below",
    ", description of the rotational percolation models will be given and the multifractal aspects of the spanning clusters will be investigated .",
    "there are two well studied rotationally constrained percolation models , spiral percolation ( sp)@xcite and directed spiral percolation ( dsp)@xcite . in these models , clusters are grown following single cluster growth monte carlo ( mc ) algorithms . in these algorithms , the central site of the lattice",
    "is occupied with unit probability .",
    "the nearest neighbors of the central site is occupied with equal probability @xmath2 in the first time step .",
    "as soon as a site is occupied , the direction from which it was occupied is assigned to it .",
    "lists of eligible sites for occupation in the next mc time steps are identified and they are occupied with probability @xmath2 . in these algorithms",
    ", an occupied site can be reoccupied from a different direction but it is forbidden for occupation from the same direction .",
    "once a site is rejected for occupation it is forbidden for occupation throughout the simulation from any possible direction .",
    "each mc time step can be considered as parallel update of nearest neighbours of already occupied sites .",
    "the growth of a cluster stops if there is no eligible site available for occupation .",
    "identification of eligible sites for occupation in a mc step for sp and dsp are given below .",
    "in sp , only a rotational field @xmath12 is applied perpendicular to the plane ( @xmath13 ) of the lattice and directed along the negative @xmath6-axis ( of a right handed coordinate system ) . as an effect of the @xmath12 field , empty sites in the forward direction and in the clockwisely rotational direction are eligible for occupation .",
    "the forward direction is the direction from which the present site is occupied and the sense of rotational direction is defined with respect to the forward direction .",
    "the selection of eligible sites for occupation in sp model is demonstrated in fig.[demo](@xmath14 ) for both the square and triangular lattices .",
    "there are two eligible sites on the square lattice and three eligible sites on the triangular lattice due to higher coordination number .",
    "the eligible sites are then occupied with probability @xmath2 and the clusters grow isotropically on the lattice@xcite .    in case of dsp , a crossed directional field @xmath15 is also applied in addition to the rotational field @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath15 field is applied from left to right in the plane of the lattice and @xmath12 is , as usual , directed along the negative @xmath6 axis . due to @xmath15 field , empty site on the right of an occupied site",
    "is eligible for occupation along with the eligible sites for occupation due to @xmath12 field .",
    "the selection of eligible sites for occupation in dsp model is demonstrated in fig.[demo](@xmath16 ) for both the square and triangular lattices .",
    "the components of the directional constraint remain the same on both the lattices whereas there is an extra component of rotational constraint on the triangular lattice as in sp .",
    "the eligible sites are then occupied with probability @xmath2 . once a site is rejected for occupation it is forbidden for occupation throughout the simulation from any possible direction due to both @xmath15 and @xmath12 fields .",
    "because of the simultaneous presence of both the @xmath15 and @xmath12 fields crossed to each other , a hall field @xmath17 appears in the system perpendicular to both @xmath15 and @xmath12 . as a result , an effective directional constraint @xmath18 acts on the system along the diagonal from left upper to right lower corner of the lattice . here , the clusters grow anisotropically along the effective field @xmath19@xcite .",
    "the coordinate of an occupied site in a cluster is denoted by @xmath20,@xmath21 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in both directions and the coordinates of the occupied sites are adjusted accordingly whenever the boundary is crossed . at each time step the span of the cluster in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 directions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are determined .",
    "if @xmath26 or @xmath27 , the system size , then the cluster is considered to be a spanning cluster .    since",
    "an occupied site can be reoccupied from different directions due to the presence of rotational constraint in both the models , a site then can be occupied at most @xmath6 times from @xmath6 possible directions on a given lattice where @xmath6 is the coordination number of the lattice .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is @xmath8 on the square lattice and it is @xmath9 on the triangular lattice .",
    "this is unlike in the case of the ordinary percolation where a site is occupied only once .",
    "it is an essential and a special feature of sp and dsp models .",
    "it is thus possible to assign a state variable @xmath0 to each site and the value of @xmath0 will represent the number of times a site is occupied or visited .",
    "initially the values of @xmath0 are all set to zero .",
    "as soon as a site is occupied from any direction , the value of @xmath0 is increased by @xmath10 .",
    "the values of the state variable is then given by @xmath28 on a given lattice .",
    "@xmath29 corresponds to unoccupied site .",
    "the state variable @xmath0 here is similar to the ising spins with @xmath30 states . in case of op",
    ", @xmath0 could have values only @xmath7 and @xmath10 corresponding to unoccupied and occupied sites .",
    "percolation clusters are generated here in the presence of rotational constraint on the square and triangular lattices of size @xmath31 for both sp and dsp models .",
    "the percolation transition will be established first at the original @xmath1 by calculating `` spontaneous magnetization '' in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "the multifractal aspects of the measure distribution on the spanning clusters , defined in terms of @xmath0 , are then investigated for both isotropic sp and anisotropic dsp clusters at @xmath11 .",
    "the cluster properties are averaged over @xmath32 spanning clusters .",
    "geometrically , the critical percolation probability @xmath1 is the maximum probability below which no spanning cluster appears . at @xmath11 ,",
    "a spanning cluster appears for the first time in the system . in single cluster growth approach ,",
    "the threshold @xmath1 is generally identified by measuring the probability to have a spanning cluster ( @xmath33 ) as a function of @xmath2 , the occupation probability .",
    "@xmath33 goes to zero continuously as @xmath2 tends to @xmath1 from above . in the state variable formalism",
    ", the value of @xmath1 can be identified in terms of `` spontaneous magnetization '' @xmath34 defined in terms of the state variable @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the lattice size and @xmath37 is the total number of spanning clusters generated .",
    "@xmath38 represents the magnetization per site for the @xmath39th spanning cluster generated using single cluster growth method . at @xmath40 , all the sites of an infinite cluster are expected to be occupied @xmath6 times where @xmath6 is the coordination number of the lattice and the size of the infinite cluster will be of the order of @xmath41 , square of the system size .",
    "thus , @xmath42 is equal to @xmath6 . as @xmath2 tends to the percolation threshold @xmath1 from above",
    ", @xmath34 is expected to go to zero continuously from its maximum value @xmath6 at @xmath40 not only because the sites will be occupied less number of times but also the spanning cluster will disappear .",
    "@xmath34 is measured on the square lattice ( @xmath43 ) for dsp model and it is plotted against @xmath2 in fig.[orderp ] .",
    "it can be seen that it is going to zero at @xmath11 as expected and the value of @xmath1 is the same as that determined by geometrical approach @xmath44@xcite .",
    "it is also expected that @xmath34 becomes singular at @xmath11 with an exponent @xmath45 as @xmath46 . in the inset of fig.[orderp ] , the power law has been verified and the exponent @xmath45 is determined approximately as @xmath47 , close to the already obtained value ( @xmath48)@xcite . the state variable formalism of the rotationally constrained percolation models is then consistent with that of the usual geometrical approach . the value of @xmath1 has also been recovered within error bar in the case of sp .",
    "other critical properties of the models can also be identified in terms of the state variable @xmath0 and a scaling theory is possible to develop .",
    "typical spanning clusters at @xmath11 generated on the square lattice of size @xmath49 are shown in fig.[cluster](@xmath14 ) for sp and in fig.[cluster](@xmath16 ) for dsp .",
    "different values of the state variable @xmath0 is represented by different symbols as @xmath29 ( white space ) , @xmath50 ( filled circle ) , @xmath51 ( plus ) , @xmath52 ( filled triangle ) and @xmath53 ( filled square ) .",
    "it can be seen that not only the state variables @xmath0 are randomly distribution of over the spanning cluster but also the higher states form small islands allover the spanning cluster .",
    "this is similar to the situation of mass distribution on a geometrical support generally taken for multifractal study@xcite .",
    "however , the state distribution over the spanning cluster is not a simple iterative process of mass distribution over a geometrical support .",
    "the spanning clusters consist of subsets of sites occupied once , twice upto a subset of sites occupied @xmath6 times where @xmath6 is the coordination number of the lattice considered .",
    "a particular subset may appear several times in a spanning cluster at different stages of growth of the cluster during a large number of mc steps . a multiplicative cascade of these subsets is then formed in a complicated manner during the growth of the cluster .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution on the spanning cluster is then expected to have many folds .",
    "it is then interesting to investigate the moments of the @xmath0 distribution over fractal objects , the spanning clusters here .",
    "it could also be noted that the sp cluster is compact and isotropic but the dsp cluster is highly rarefied and anisotropic .",
    "the elongation of the dsp cluster is along the effective field @xmath19 appeared in the system .",
    "however , the clusters are not merely dp clusters along @xmath19 .",
    "it has already been found that both sp and dsp belong to new universality classes than that of dp or op@xcite . the fractal dimension @xmath5 of the spanning clusters",
    "were found as @xmath54@xcite for dsp and @xmath55@xcite for sp .",
    "geometrical properties of the percolation clusters are governed by this single exponent @xmath5 .",
    "however , in the following it will be demonstrated that a measure defined in terms of the state variable @xmath0 is not restricted by a single exponent rather needs a sequence of fractal dimensions to characterize the measure .",
    "in order to study multifractality a suitable measure has to be defined . in general , a multifractal measure is related to the distribution of a physical quantity on a geometrical support @xcite .",
    "the geometrical support here is the spanning percolation cluster at @xmath11 for the rotationally constrained percolation models .",
    "the distribution of the relative probability of a state over fractal substrates is a possible multifractal measure here .",
    "it is similar to the mass distribution on a geometrical support .",
    "the multifractal measure @xmath56 is then defined as @xmath57 where @xmath0 is the state variable associated with each lattice site .",
    "@xmath56 can be called as relative state variable .",
    "note that the measure @xmath56 is normalized to unity when summed over the whole lattice .",
    "the maximum value of the measure is @xmath58 and the minimum non - zero measure is @xmath59 where @xmath6 is the coordination number of the lattice . to obtain the multifractal nature of the distribution @xmath56 ,",
    "it is necessary to study the scaling of the @xmath4-moments of the measure over different length scales on the geometrical support .",
    "if the measure @xmath56 is multifractal and the support is divided into @xmath60 boxes of size @xmath61 , then the weighted number of boxes @xmath62,@xmath63 is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the sum of the relative state variable in the @xmath39th box . here @xmath66 can be called as `` state exponent '' .",
    "the weighted number of box @xmath67 is determined as a function of the box size @xmath61 using box counting method for a given @xmath4 .",
    "the boxes with at least one occupied site are only considered . the weighted number of boxes @xmath67 are plotted against the box size @xmath61 for @xmath68 to @xmath69 for sp in fig.[tauq1](@xmath14 ) and for dsp in fig.[tauq1](@xmath16 ) generating spanning clusters on the square lattice of size @xmath70 .",
    "it can be seen that the slopes of the plots change continuously for positive @xmath4 up to @xmath71 . for @xmath72",
    ", it seems that the usual box counting method adopted here is not working .",
    "the values of @xmath67 remain unchanged over several box sizes @xmath61 starting from the smallest box size for a given @xmath4 in both the models .",
    "it is expected that the plot should follow a straight line passing through the points at @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the system size , in log - log scale since these two extreme points are not effected by the box size .",
    "it is shown by dashed lines for @xmath68 in both the plots .",
    "it is observed that the value of @xmath67 jumps suddenly when the box size is reduced less than one quarter of the system size .",
    "this is due to the fact that at this box size there is at least one box appearing with a small measure and consequently the sum in eq.[neq ] diverges due to negative moment .",
    "the appearance of large box sizes with small measures is because of the fact that the spanning percolation clusters contain holes of all possible sizes .",
    "difficulties in determining weighted number of boxes for @xmath72 for the measure distribution on random structures are already reported in the literature@xcite .",
    "the slopes of the plots in fig.[tauq1 ] also remain almost unchanged with the moment @xmath4 for @xmath72 .",
    "the weighted number of boxes has increased proportionally with higher negative moments .",
    "it has been verified that the estimation of @xmath66 by fitting only through the smaller box sizes leads to a discontinuity in the plot of @xmath66 versus @xmath4 which is expected to be a smooth function of @xmath4 .",
    "discontinuity in the plot of @xmath66 versus @xmath4 was also observed in the cases of resistance fluctuations in randomly diluted networks @xcite and in diffusion limited aggregation @xcite . in these cases , there are breakdown of multifractal characters for negative moments due to exponential decay of the smallest measures .",
    "multifractal characteristics of the spanning clusters of rotationally constrained percolation models are then analyzed here taking large positive moments , changing @xmath4 from @xmath7 to @xmath75 .",
    "analysis has been made on the square and triangular lattices of size @xmath70 for both sp and dsp models and the results are compared with that of the op model . in fig.[tauq2 ] , @xmath66 is plotted against @xmath4 , ( @xmath14 ) for sp model and ( @xmath16)for dsp model . in both the plots",
    "the squares represent the square lattice data and the triangles represent the triangular lattice data .",
    "circles represent the data obtained for op model .",
    "it is found that @xmath76 is @xmath77 , the fractal dimension of the corresponding spanning clusters and @xmath78 is @xmath79 here for all three models , op , sp and dsp .",
    "@xmath76 corresponds to the dimension of the support which are the spanning percolation clusters of different models considered here and @xmath78 is zero because @xmath80 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the values of @xmath66 for dsp and sp model depend on the moment @xmath4 in a nonlinear way for positive moments .",
    "if the measure @xmath56 is characterized by a single fractal dimension @xmath5 , the state exponent @xmath66 should have a constant gap between two consecutive exponents@xcite and consequently should have a linear dependence on @xmath4 . in that case",
    ", a relationship between @xmath66 and @xmath4 in terms of @xmath5 can be obtained as @xmath81 this relation is shown in fig.[tauq2 ] by a solid line for op taking @xmath82 .",
    "the values of @xmath66 obtained numerically for op ( circles ) considering a two state model for which @xmath29 and @xmath10 are in good agreement with with eq.[tqdf ] .",
    "there are few more things to notice .",
    "first , the state exponents of op obey the constant gap equation given in eq.[tqdf ] as expected .",
    "the constant gap scaling was also observed for the mean number of distinct sites visited by a random walker on spanning percolation cluster by murthy",
    "_ et al_@xcite . as a consequence , the measure distribution is mono - fractal .",
    "second , the values of @xmath66 for sp and dsp are deviated form straight line behaviour and have non - linear dependence on the moment @xmath4 .",
    "thus , each moment of the measure @xmath56 needs a new exponent to characterize in these models .",
    "third , the functional dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath4 is found different for all three models .",
    "this is expected because the models , op , sp and dsp , belong to different universality classes .",
    "fourth , the @xmath66 values on the square and triangular lattices are almost the same for the sp model whereas they are considerably different for the dsp model .",
    "this is also in agreement with the fact that the critical properties hold universality in the sp model whereas there is a breakdown of universality in dsp model between the square and triangular lattices in two dimensions@xcite .",
    "finally , the fact that a sequence of exponents is required to characterize the moments of the measure confirms the multifractal nature of @xmath56 distribution in sp and dsp models .",
    "it should be noted here that in sp and dsp the spanning clusters consist of four or six subsets depending on the number of nearest neighbours on a given lattice .",
    "the values of @xmath66 then may be possible to obtain in terms of the fractal dimensions of the subsets consisting the spanning cluster coupled with a nonlinear dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine the fractal dimensions of the individual subsets as they are generally small isolated islands in a spanning cluster as well as the nonlinear nature of @xmath66 .",
    "the associated fractal dimensions @xmath83 with the measure and the corresponding lipschitz - hlder exponent @xmath84 can be obtained through a legendre transformation @xcite of the sequence @xmath66 .",
    "the legendre transformation is given below @xmath85 the fractal dimensions @xmath83 are plotted against @xmath84 in fig.[falfa ] .",
    "the values of @xmath83 obtained for sp clusters are shown in fig.[falfa ] ( @xmath14 ) and that of the dsp clusters are shown in fig.[falfa ] ( @xmath16 ) . since in the case of op",
    ", the state exponent follows a constant gap equation ( eq.[tqdf ] ) it is expected that @xmath83 versus @xmath84 will be represented by a point @xmath86 . it is shown by an open circle in fig.[falfa ] .",
    "it has been verified measuring slopes at different regions of @xmath66 versus @xmath4 for op that the slopes remain within the error bar of the point shown . in the cases of sp and dsp , spectra of @xmath83 against @xmath84",
    "are obtained because @xmath66 has a non linear dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "the symbols square and triangle correspond to the square lattice and the triangular lattice data respectively .",
    "there are few things to observe .",
    "first , @xmath87 corresponds to @xmath5 of the respective models .",
    "second , the @xmath83 curves are always @xmath88 since the supports are spanning percolation clusters of fractal dimension @xmath5 .",
    "third , the spectrum of fractal dimensions @xmath83 for sp and dsp are found different .",
    "it means that not only the mass fractal dimension @xmath5 is different but also the whole set fractal dimensions @xmath83s are different .",
    "it is expected because sp and dsp belong to different universality classes .",
    "fourth , in case of sp , the spectrum of @xmath83 for the square lattice is identical with that of the triangular lattice for lower moments ( starting from the same mass fractal dimension ) and slightly different at large positive moments . in case of dsp , the spectra of @xmath83 on the two lattices are considerably different over the full range of positive moments considered here , starting from two different mass fractal dimensions .",
    "this again confirms the universality of critical exponents in sp and breakdown of universality of critical exponents in dsp between square and triangular lattices in two dimensions@xcite .",
    "fifth , the values of @xmath89 for both sp and dsp clusters are not equal to zero .",
    "this means that in these cases , the rarest regions of measure @xmath90 distribution are still fractal in the limit @xmath91 .",
    "it is evident from the spanning clusters configurations given in fig.[cluster ] that the @xmath90 distribution appears in small islands allover the spanning clusters and not as a point distribution .",
    "the fractal dimension of @xmath90 distribution of sp clusters is found little higher than that of dsp clusters .",
    "this is due to the presence of an extra directional constraint in the dsp model which takes the growth of the cluster away from a @xmath90 point whereas due to pure rotational constraint in the sp model the probability of growth around a @xmath90 point is little higher in comparison to dsp .",
    "it can also be noticed that , in case of dsp , the whole @xmath83 spectrum is shifted upward in order to match with the mass fractal dimension of the spanning dsp clusters on the triangular lattice .",
    "however this is not the case in sp model .",
    "finally , the values of @xmath83 converges at a minimum of lipschitz - hlder exponent @xmath92 .",
    "the lipschitz - hlder exponent @xmath93 is defined as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the increment in the measure over a length @xmath96 to @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath92 value corresponds to the minimum of @xmath96 , the length scale associated with @xmath90 clusters in this case .",
    "it could also be noticed that in both sp and dsp , the values of @xmath92 on the triangular lattice is found little higher than that of the square lattice .",
    "this is due to the fact that the number of @xmath90 points are generally higher on the triangular lattice than that on the square lattice .",
    "using the concept of state variable , the percolation transition in rotationally constrained models is established at the same percolation threshold @xmath1 defined geometrically .",
    "a relative state variable is defined to study the multifractal aspects of the spanning clusters at @xmath11 .",
    "it is found that the @xmath4-moments of the measure is characterized by a sequence of `` state exponents '' @xmath66 for both sp and dsp .",
    "the existence of a sequence of state exponents confirms the multifractal character of the distribution of relative state variable on the infinite clusters of sp and dsp .",
    "the op spanning clusters are not found multifractal in this measure .",
    "taking legendre transformation of @xmath66 , different spectra of associated fractal dimensions @xmath83 as a function of lipschitz - hlder exponents @xmath84 are obtained .",
    "the universality of critical exponents in sp and breakdown of universality in dsp are also confirmed by the multifractal spectrum of fractal dimensions .",
    "the formalism of state variable is thus found suitable for studying percolation transition and multifractal aspects of certain percolation models .",
