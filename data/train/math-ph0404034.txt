    "it is well known that in quantum field theory under external conditions , quantities like vacuum energies and effective actions , which describe the influence of boundaries or external fields on the physical system , are generically divergent and require a renormalization to get a physical meaning .    in this context , a powerful and elegant regularization scheme to deal with these problems is based on the use of the @xmath1-function @xcite or the heat - kernel ( for recent reviews see , for example , @xcite ) associated to the relevant differential operators appearing in the quadratic part of the actions . in this way , ground state energies , heat - kernel coefficients , functional determinants and partition functions for quantum fields can be given in terms of the corresponding @xmath1-function , where the ultraviolet divergent pieces of the one - loop contributions are encoded as poles of its holomorphic extension .",
    "thus , it is of major interest in physics to determine the singularity structure of @xmath1-functions associated with these physical models .    in particular @xcite , for an elliptic boundary value problem in a @xmath3-dimensional compact manifold with boundary , described by a differential operator @xmath4 of order @xmath5 , with smooth coefficients and a ray of minimal growth , defined on a domain of functions subject to local boundary conditions",
    ", the @xmath1-function @xmath6 has a meromorphic extension to the complex @xmath7-plane whose singularities are isolated simple poles at @xmath8 , with @xmath9    in the case of positive definite operators , the @xmath1-function is related , via mellin transform , to the trace of the heat - kernel of the problem , and the pole structure of @xmath10 determines the small-@xmath2 asymptotic expansion of this trace @xcite : @xmath11 where the coefficients are related to the residues by @xmath12    for operators of the form @xmath13 with a singular potential @xmath14 asymptotic to @xmath15 as @xmath16 , this expansion is substantially different . if @xmath17 , the operator is essentially self - adjoint .",
    "this case has been treated in @xcite , where log terms are found , as well as terms with coefficients which are distributions concentrated at the singular point @xmath18 . for the case",
    "@xmath19 , the friedrichs extension has been treated in @xcite for operators in @xmath20 , and in @xcite for operators in @xmath21 , making use of the scale invariance of the operator domain and explicit representations of the resolvent .",
    "moreover , as a particular case of a manifold with an isolated conic singularity , reference @xcite gave a description of the boundary behavior of the friedrichs heat - kernel which does not make use of the resolvent , and showed va boundary maps how it can be used to construct the heat - kernel for other self - adjoint extensions of these operators , showing explicitly the first two terms in the asymptotic expansion of the trace of their difference .",
    "on the other hand , reference @xcite gave the pole structure of the @xmath1-function of a second order differential operator defined on the ( non compact ) half - line @xmath22 , having a singular zero - th order term @xmath23 .",
    "it showed that , for a certain range of real values of @xmath24 , this operator admits nontrivial self - adjoint extensions in @xmath21 , for which the associated @xmath1-function ( given by an integral representation ) presents isolated simple poles which ( in general ) do not lie at @xmath25 for @xmath26 ( as would be the case for a regular @xmath14 ) , and can even take irrational values .",
    "a similar structure has been noticed in @xcite for the singularities of the @xmath1 and @xmath27-functions of a system of first order differential operators with a singular zero - th order term @xmath28 , which also admits a family of self - adjoint extensions for real @xmath29 taking values in certain range .",
    "it has been shown that , in the general case , the asymptotic expansion of the resolvent contains @xmath30dependent powers of @xmath0 which make the @xmath1 and @xmath27-functions to present poles lying at points which depend on the singularity , with residues depending on the self - adjoint extension .",
    "let us mention that singular potentials @xmath31 have been considered in the description of several physical systems , like the calogero model @xcite , conformal invariant quantum mechanical models @xcite and , more recently , the dynamics of quantum particles in the asymptotic near - horizon region of black - holes @xcite .",
    "the self - adjoint extensions of these operators have also been considered in @xcite . moreover , singular superpotentials has been considered as possible agents of supersymmetry breaking in models of supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .    it is the aim of the present article to analyze the behavior of the resolvent , the @xmath1-function and the trace of the heat - kernel of a second order differential operator with a regular singularity in a compact segment , @xmath32 , for those values of @xmath29 for which it admits a family of self - adjoint extensions .    following the scheme developed in @xcite",
    ", we will show that the asymptotic expansion for the resolvent in the general case presents powers of @xmath0 which depend on the singularity , and can even take irrational values .",
    "the consequence of this behavior on the corresponding @xmath1-function is the presence of simple poles lying at points which also depend on the singularity , with residues depending on the self - adjoint extension considered .",
    "we first construct the resolvents for two particular extensions , for which the boundary condition at the singular point @xmath18 is invariant under the scaling @xmath33 .",
    "the resolvent expansion for these special extensions displays the usual powers , leading to the usual poles for the @xmath1-function ( and the usual structure for the asymptotic expansion of the heat - kernel trace ) .",
    "the resolvents of the remaining extensions are convex linear combinations of these special extensions , but the coefficients in the convex combination depend on the eigenvalue parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this dependence leads to unusual powers in the resolvent expansion , and hence to unusual poles for the zeta - function ( and unusual powers in the asymptotic expansion of the heat - kernel trace ) .",
    "these self - adjoint extensions are not invariant under the scaling @xmath34 .",
    "as @xmath35 they tend ( at least formally ) to one of the invariant extensions , and as @xmath36 they tend to the other .",
    "as @xmath35 the residues at the anomalous poles tend to zero , whereas as @xmath36 these residues become infinite . the way these residues depend on the boundary condition",
    "is explained by a scaling argument in section 7 .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows : in section [ the - operator ] we define the operator and determine its self - adjoint extensions for @xmath37 , and in section [ the - spectrum ] we study their spectra . in section [ the - resolvent ]",
    "we construct the resolvent for a general extension as a linear combination of the resolvent of two limiting cases , and in section [ trace - resolvent ] we consider the traces of these operators .",
