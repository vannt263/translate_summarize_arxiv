    "starting with the kramers paper @xcite much work has been put into calculating @xmath3 and the prefactor in the escape rate for various physical systems . from this point of view , it is particularly important to reveal generic features of the activation energy @xmath3 , such as scaling behavior with the system parameters .",
    "the onset of the scaling behavior was noticed first for systems close to thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "scaling occurs also for systems far from thermal equilibrium , which generally do not have detailed balance .",
    "nonequilibrium systems may display several types of scaling behaviors and crossovers between different scalings with varying system parameters .",
    "a nonequilibrium system that has attracted much attention recently is a duffing oscillator modulated by a periodic force @xmath4 with high quality factor @xmath5 .",
    "the term @xmath6 is white noise with property @xmath7 . as a result of the modulation",
    "the oscillator may have two or more coexisting states of forced vibrations .",
    "noise leads to switching between these states . in this paper",

    "therefore the problem of transition rates between two stable attractors is a _ non - equilibrium _ problem !",
    "several types of scaling behavior of the switching activation energy have been seen for such different systems as modulated nanoelectromechanical ( nems ) @xcite , and microelectromechanical ( mems ) oscillators @xcite ( various sources of noise in the nanomechanical systems have been thoroughly described in @xcite ) , josephson junctions @xcite , optically trapped atoms @xcite , and superconducting resonators @xcite - all of these systems are modelled as duffing oscillators . not only is this scaling interesting on its own , but it also underlies various applications , an important example being quantum measurements @xcite .",

    "[ fig : s - shaped figure ] .",
    "the separatrix between the basins of attraction of each of the two attractors is a set of initial conditions that flows into the saddle fp via its attractive eigen - direction .    in the presence of noise ,",

    "let s note that there are infinitely many _",
    "optimal _ trajectories from attractor to the saddle - they all differ by their initial momenta , but only paths that have zero energy give the _ stationary _ @xmath64 . one way to see this is to substitute @xmath65 into the _ stationary _ fpe , and obtain @xcite @xmath66 = 0 .",
    "this is just a hamilton - jacobi equation , @xmath67 , and it describes dynamics on the @xmath68 manifold .",

    "this separation of time scales breaks down very close to a bifurcation point , so as long as @xmath15 , there will always be a small fraction of the hysteresis displaying a @xmath26 scaling . aside from this very narrow region ,",

    "dss considered two scenarios which may happen when @xmath11 _ equals _ zero .",

    "therefore , assuming smooth dependence upon @xmath73 , it must be that @xmath122 .",
    "in other words , the @xmath24 power law in this situation holds beyond where it was expected to hold due to a soft mode theory ! in the duffing system , a nonlocal bifurcation takes place at @xmath14 . in the numerical experiments described below",

    "is given by @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is independent of @xmath73 and has a local minimum and maximum .",
    "the homoclinic loop of such systems has the property that only its size in the @xmath126-direction shrinks to zero as @xmath113 , while the distance between the center and the saddle inside the loop remains finite .",
    "introduction of damping into these types of systems will not change the separation between the saddle and the attractor until the system has come close enough to the bifurcation : @xmath127 .",
    "dss proved that given this form of the hamiltonian @xmath62 , addition of noise and damping leads @xmath128 ( in the underdamped regime ) .",
    "therefore , at finite @xmath11 we expect a @xmath111 scaling moderately close to the bifurcation , but further away then the region of over - damped @xmath26 scaling . in the duffing system , a nonlocal bifurcation takes place at @xmath112 .",
    "it is important to stress that all saddle - node bifurcations at _ finite _ @xmath11 are local in the sense that the attractor and the saddle merge as @xmath113 .",
    "the terms `` local '' or `` nonlocal '' only make sense at zero @xmath11 . we must also mention that a nonlocal bifurcations may take place in many forms . for example , in a duffing oscillator , the homoclinic loop has a horse - shoe shape at @xmath129 which becomes thinner while remaining extended as @xmath113 .",
    "dss found a change of variables which maps from @xmath62 to @xmath130 .",
    "numerical calculations of escape rate are based on direct evaluation of @xmath58 .",
    "the algorithm for doing so is as follows .",
    "( 1 ) choose parameters @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "( 2 ) calculate repulsive eigenvectors ( i.e. those whose eigenvalues have positive real part ) of the fp @xmath131 of the auxiliary system .",
    "these eigenvectors span the tangent plane to the unstable manifold of this attractor .",

    "[ eq : h ] ) .",
    "the angle around this circle , @xmath132 , serves as a parameter that enumerates a trajectory .",
    "( 4 ) from this set of trajectories , find the one which leads into the saddle , with a special trajectory parameter @xmath133 . because the method involves `` shooting '' many trajectories to see which one hits the saddle , this method is occasionally called `` the shooting method '' . ( 5 ) evaluate the action along this trajectory .",
    "for each @xmath11 , this procedure would be repeated for many values of @xmath10 between @xmath112 and @xmath14 .    in practice ,",
    "step ( 4 ) may require several rounds of bracketing . in each round",
    ", for each trajectory , we calculate the distance between the saddle and the point of intersection of that trajectory with the separatrix , measured along the separatrix .",
    "we identify a @xmath132 for which the trajectory came closest to the saddle and then evolve another set of trajectories in a small range of trajectory parameters around this @xmath132 .",
    "after more and more rounds of such procedure , we would obtain a trajectory that hits the separatrix closer and closer to the saddle .",
    "in general , finding a trajectory that connects an attractor with the saddle is difficult because it lies on the intersection of the unstable manifold of the attractor and the stable manifold of the saddle in the 4d auxiliary space @xcite , .",
    "a small deviation of @xmath132 on opposite side of @xmath133 will produce trajectories that lie on opposite sides of this intersection and will diverge from each other .",
    "this effect is most pronounced closer to bifurcations because the motion along the optimal trajectory becomes much slower then the diverging motion away from it - such is the structure of eigenvalues of both attractor and saddle close to the bifurcation .",
    "this polarity takes place only close to bifurcation points , but it persists further away from bifurcation points when @xmath11 is larger .",
    "therefore , in the small-@xmath11 regime , finding a trajectory between an attractor and the saddle is difficult only very close to bifurcation points , but in the large-@xmath11 regime , finding such a trajectory is difficult over a larger part of the hysteresis",
