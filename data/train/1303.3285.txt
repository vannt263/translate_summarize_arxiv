    "the core structure of galaxy clusters is of fundamental importance not only for astrophysics , but for physics as a whole .",
    "the essential reason for this statement is that the properties of the yet hypothetical dark - matter particles , and the dominance of not electromagnetically interacting dark matter itself , can be tested in the cores of galaxy clusters .    due to the virial theorem ,",
    "self - gravitating systems have a negative heat capacity .",
    "this is easily seen as follows . in its scalar version ,",
    "the virial theorem demands that the total kinetic energy @xmath1 and the potential energy @xmath2 be related by @xmath3 the factors multiplying the two forms of energy are due to the fact that the kinetic energy is a homogeneous function of degree @xmath4 of velocity , while the potential energy is a homogeneous function of degree @xmath5 of position .",
    "the total energy is thus @xmath6 self - gravitating systems can lose energy in various ways .",
    "for example , particles can become unbound and be ejected from the system in three - body encounters , or baryonic gas mixed with the dark matter can radiate energy and adiabatically contract the dark matter .",
    "if a self - gravitating system loses energy , no matter how , the system s total energy decreases . since it is negative for a bound system , its absolute value increases thereby and , following the virial theorem ( [ eq : c-2 ] ) , its kinetic energy must also increase .",
    "cooling of the system by any kind of energy loss thus leads to heating of the system by contraction , which defines a negative heat capacity .",
    "this in turn implies that self - gravitating systems can not reach a stable equilibrium state where a suitable thermodynamical potential could attain a minimum .",
    "nonetheless , numerical simulations of dissipation - less dark matter under the exclusive influence of gravity unanimously show that long - lived , gravitationally bound systems form in a wide range of masses , the so - called dark - matter haloes .",
    "quite independent of various initial conditions such as the power spectrum of the dark matter fluctuations , these haloes turn out to have a universal density profile @xmath7 , characterised by two radii . within the outer radius , the virial radius @xmath8 to be defined below",
    ", virial equilibrium is supposed to be achieved .",
    "qualitatively speaking , the density profile is steep from an inner radius , the scale radius @xmath9 , to the virial radius , and flat from the halo centre to the scale radius . while simulations agree that the double - logarithmic slope @xmath10 reaches the asymptotic value @xmath11 near the virial radius , inner slopes between @xmath5 and @xmath12 are typically measured in simulated haloes . introducing the dimension - less radius @xmath13 , density profiles of the functional form @xmath14 fit the numerically simulated dark - matter haloes very well , with @xmath15 . for @xmath16 , the profile ( [ eq:2 ] )",
    "was first suggested by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter abbreviated by nfw ) , while @xcite favoured steeper central profiles with @xmath17 .",
    "more recent , highly resolved numerical studies find that the density - profile slope decreases gently from the scale radius inward @xcite in a way that may depend on the halo mass @xcite . a density profile with an alternative functional form , @xmath18\\ ; , \\label{eq:2a}\\ ] ] was suggested by einasto ( see * ? ? ? * ) and found to fit density profiles of numerically simulated dark - matter haloes very well @xcite with @xmath19 . in ( [ eq:2a ] ) , the scale radius @xmath9 was introduced such that the profile slope is @xmath20 at @xmath21 , which is also the case for the nfw profile at @xmath22 .",
    "the slope of the einasto profile , @xmath23 decreases continuously towards the centre and reaches zero there .",
    "one important difference between the generalised nfw profile ( [ eq:2 ] ) and the einasto profile ( [ eq:2a ] ) , shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] , is the central density cusp in the former , but not in the latter .",
    "if the dark - matter particles decay or annihilate , the annihilation rates in both types of density profile may be substantially different . as two - body processes ,",
    "annihilation rates are proportional to the squared particle density , hence cusped density profiles may predict higher rates than profiles with a finite - density core .",
    "more important than the central cusp , however , seems to be the level of substructure in cluster haloes , as we shall discuss later .",
    "we shall return further below to the issue of the slope @xmath24 near the centre of cluster haloes .",
    "for the purpose of our present discussion , the exact value of @xmath24 is less important , however .",
    "since stable final states of self - gravitating systems can not be expected for the reasons given above , the mere fact that long - lived transient states like dark - matter haloes do exist at all and form a universal density profile is a most remarkable finding on its own .",
    "the ratio between the two radii , the concentration parameter @xmath25 is found to be closely related to the masses and the formation times of the haloes . generally , the earlier a halo forms , the larger the concentration parameter is .",
    "this is commonly attributed to the higher cosmic background density at the time of halo formation .",
    "we shall discuss the concentrations in more detail below .",
    "the global properties of a dark - matter halo , i.e.  its radius @xmath8 and its mass @xmath26 , are commonly related to each other and to the parameters of the cosmic background through the spherical collapse model . specifically , the model states that the mean matter density enclosed by the virial radius should be higher than the mean cosmic density @xmath27 by the virial overdensity @xmath28 , thus @xmath29 the virial overdensity @xmath28 depends on redshift and on cosmology . in terms of the matter - density parameter @xmath30 at the present epoch or of the matter - density @xmath31 as a function of redshift , the mean cosmic matter density is @xmath32 for an einstein - de sitter universe with critical matter density and without a cosmological constant , the mean overdensity is analytically found to be @xmath33 . for",
    "the standard cosmological model , @xmath34 ( relative to the mean cosmic density ) is substantially higher and changes with redshift , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "often , @xmath34 is instead given relative to the critical cosmic density and thus reduced by a factor @xmath31 compared to the values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "the considerations so far show that the formation and in particular the existence of long - lived transient states of dark - matter haloes , at least in numerical simulations of collision - less dark matter , seems to be a remarkably well - determined process without much freedom .",
    "the collapse dynamics sets the virial overdensity @xmath28 which , together with the cosmic mean matter density @xmath27 , relates the virial radius to the mass .",
    "the concentration , which itself seems to be defined by the formation redshift , then sets the scale radius .",
    "given that , the density profile is defined .",
    "if the dark matter is cold , the power spectrum @xmath35 of the initial density fluctuations from which the haloes ultimately form has a characteristic shape that is again fully determined by few cosmological conditions . for small @xmath36",
    ", it increases as a power law in @xmath36 , @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "for very large @xmath36 , it decreases asymptotically like @xmath39 .",
    "the power - law index @xmath40 is set by cosmological inflation very early during the evolution of the universe .",
    "if inflation had lasted eternally , the power spectrum would be precisely scale - free , @xmath41 .",
    "since inflation must have ended after a finite time , @xmath40 should be slightly smaller .",
    "it belongs to the most exciting results of the wmap satellite mission that @xmath40 is indeed slightly , but significantly smaller than unity , @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the decrease of the slope by @xmath43 is also entirely defined by the inhibition of growth of dark - matter fluctuations inside the horizon during the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "the maximum of the power spectrum is thus set by the horizon size at the epoch of matter - radiation equality , which is in turn defined by the cosmic matter - density parameter .",
    "it is essential for our purposes to note that the dark - matter fluctuation power spectrum has no free parameters except for its overall normalisation .",
    "traditionally , this normalisation is fixed by the parameter @xmath44 , generally defined by specialising the scale - dependent variance @xmath45 to the radius @xmath46 . in ( [ eq:6 ] )",
    ", @xmath47 is a fourier - transformed window function introduced to smooth fluctuations on scales smaller than @xmath48 .",
    "the specific setting of this length scale to @xmath49 has historical reasons : first measurements of @xmath44 based on the galaxy distribution found that variance of the density contrast was approximately unity on a scale of @xmath49 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* for an example ) .",
    "the power in the dark - matter fluctuations is proportional to the volume in @xmath36-space times the power spectrum , or @xmath50 , which asymptotically tends to @xmath51 for large @xmath36 . since @xmath38 , the power keeps rising with @xmath36 until it gently flattens off asymptotically for very large @xmath36 .",
    "this means that the largest power is in the smallest fluctuations , giving rise to the bottom - up scenario of cosmological structure formation in cold dark matter : those fluctuations with the largest power form first , hence structures in cold dark matter start forming at the smallest scales .",
    "it is thus expected that cold dark matter clumps on all scales . moreover",
    ", the largest structures will form the latest . depending on the normalisation parameter @xmath44 ,",
    "a maximum mass is expected which could just have formed in the cosmic present .",
    "the statistics of cosmological structures is characterised by the assumption that they form from an initially gaussian random field with a low amplitude . during the linear phase of structure growth ,",
    "this amplitude increased proportional to the linear growth factor @xmath52 without any interaction between different fourier modes of the density field .",
    "the spherical - collapse model predicts that non - linear collapse concludes when the linear density contrast has reached a critical value @xmath53 which is @xmath54 in an einstein - de sitter universe and not much different in other model universes .",
    "the abundance of cosmological objects of a certain mass can then be derived directly from the peak statistics in a gaussian random field .",
    "the result is the press - schechter mass function , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mean cosmic matter density today .",
    "the radius @xmath48 and the mass @xmath26 are related by requiring that a sphere with radius @xmath48 filled with the mean cosmic matter density should contain the mass @xmath26 , @xmath57 again , the details of this mass function and its possible modifications are not relevant for our discussion .",
    "it is important , however , that the mass function cuts off exponentially at a mass scale defined by @xmath58 the larger @xmath48 is , and therefore the larger the masses are that are being considered , the lower is the variance @xmath59 and the larger @xmath52 has to become for ( [ eq:10 ] ) to be satisfied .",

    "its fourier transform @xmath65 inserted into ( [ eq:6 ] ) , returns the variance @xmath66 on the scale @xmath48 .",

    "numerical simulations at high resolution , assuming cold dark matter , find strongly substructured haloes .",
    "numerous different simulation runs undertaken during recent years arrive at the following statements on the substructure level :    the amount of substructure in a halo increases with the mass of the host halo . at fixed host - halo mass",
    ", it decreases with the concentration of the host halo and with its formation redshift .",
    "these trends are noticeable , but of comparable amplitude as the scatter in the subhalo abundance between similar host haloes .",
    "the abundance of low - mass substructures per unit host - halo mass reflects that of the surrounding universe as a whole .",
    "the subhaloes are substantially less spatially concentrated than the dark matter .",
    "different approaches to the identification of subhaloes within host haloes lead to similar substructure abundance functions @xcite .",
    "taking into account baryons in addition to the dark matter , @xcite find that the diffuse hot gas is efficiently removed from subhaloes when they enter their host haloes .",
    "compared to simulations with purely dark matter , stripping of the gas may decrease the subhalo mass function . however , if radiative cooling of the baryons is taken into account , baryons condense towards the centre of the subhaloes and form compact stellar cores , thus mitigating the effect of stripping . in all variants of the simulations including baryons ,",
    "only about @xmath69 of the subhaloes within the virial radii of their host haloes preserve a gravitationally bound hot gaseous atmosphere .",
    "based on the millennium - ii simulation data , @xcite proposed a fitting formula for the abundance function of subhaloes , @xmath70\\ ; , \\label{eq:6b}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the ratio between the masses of subhaloes and the virial mass of their host halo .",
    "@xcite confirm that the fractional mass in subhaloes , @xmath72 , gently increases until @xmath73 and falls steeply above .",
    "the peak in the fractional mass increases from @xmath74 to @xmath75 from galaxy- to cluster - sized host haloes .",
    "recent observations and surveys of high - energy gamma rays with imaging cherenkov telescopes and with the large area telescope ( lat ) on - board the fermi satellite have resulted in a variety of theoretical investigations of galaxy clusters and interesting inferences .",
    "so far , galaxy clusters have escaped detection both by cherenkov imaging and by fermi - lat . both types of telescope cover very wide ranges of gamma energies . while the high - energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) is sensitive to gamma photons with energies between @xmath76 to @xmath77 , fermi - lat shows the highest response at smaller gamma energies between @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "after one year of operation , the non - detection with fermi - lat of a gamma signal from nearby galaxy clusters led @xcite to conclude that cluster substructures should have masses of at least @xmath80 .",
    "the argument behind this conclusion is straightforward : substructures in clusters are expected to be substantially denser than the surrounding , smoothly distributed cluster matter , and are thus expected to emit a good fraction , if not most of a cluster s hypothetical gamma signal .",
    "the non - detections of gamma rays from nearby clusters then imply an upper limit to the lumpiness of cluster matter . assuming a mass function for the cluster substructures",
    ", this upper limit translates to a lower limit of substructure masses , since the mass function should increase quite steeply towards decreasing mass .",
    "@xcite used essentially the same line of reasoning to argue that nearby galaxy clusters may be more efficient probes of dark - matter annihilation than local dwarf galaxies when viewed with imaging cherenkov telescopes .",
    "conversely , @xcite argued that , should clusters contain substructures down to the earth s mass , models of dark - matter annihilation through leptonic channels ( so - called leptophilic models ) would be ruled out by the lack of detections .",
    "similarly , the cross section for dark - matter annihilation was constrained from above by the gamma non - detections .",
    "@xcite used 2.8 years of fermi - lat data taken from 49 nearby clusters to derive @xmath81 at @xmath82 for the velocity - averaged annihilation cross section without taking into account that baryonic energy dissipation may contract the dark - matter distribution , and argued that baryonic contraction could lower this upper limit by about an order of magnitude . from three years of fermi - lat data and gamma non - detection from eight nearby galaxy clusters , @xcite derived a lower limit on the dark - matter decay time of @xmath83 and an upper limit on the dark - matter annihilation cross section of @xmath81 at gamma energies near @xmath82 .",
    "these constraints tighten by @xmath84 orders of magnitude once cluster substructures are taken into account .",
    "@xcite placed an upper limit on the dark - matter annihilation cross section of @xmath85 at @xmath82 , possibly lowering by @xmath86 orders of magnitude due to substructure , from the non - detection of the nearby fornax cluster in 14.5 hours of observation with h.e.s.s .",
    "these conclusions are well consistent with each other and show that upper limits on the annihilation cross section as tight as @xmath87 can be inferred at gamma energies near @xmath88 from the gamma non - detections if galaxy clusters are substructured as expected from simulations .",
    "interestingly , @xcite deduce from highly resolved simulations not only that the dark - matter annihilation signal from galaxy clusters should be stronger than from galaxies because of the substructures , but also that it should emerge preferentially from large cluster - centric radii since substructures are likely to be tidally destroyed near cluster cores .",
    "they identify the coma and fornax clusters as most promising candidates for gamma detections in future observations .",
    "these results should be read with some caution , however .",
    "firm predictions of the gamma emission expected from galaxy clusters require that the abundance and the central density of substructures with very low masses be accurately known , possibly down to stellar- or even lower - mass structures .",
    "this is well outside the reach of even the best - resolved numerical simulations today .",
    "current inferences from the non - detection of gamma rays from clusters are thus based on substantial extrapolations of simulation results towards masses well below their resolution limit .",
    "summarising the discussion so far , we see that galaxy clusters , which are at the massive end of the spectrum of gravitationally bound cosmic structures , formed latest during the cosmic evolution if structure formation proceeded in a bottom - up way , as expected if the dark matter is cold .",
    "in such a scenario , the most massive objects must always be a dynamically active population since they are the most recent to have formed and did at least in part not have the time to relax .",
    "small , lower - mass structures formed earlier , which means that the more massive objects must at least partially have been assembled by merging smaller units .",
    "even though it is expected that part of the small structures that finally end up as parts of a galaxy cluster get disrupted , clusters should host sublumps with a broad continuum of masses . the mass fraction contained in the sublumps",
    "is expected to reach the per cent level , with subhaloes of approximately one per cent of the cluster mass contributing most .",
    "tidal disruption of subhaloes near cluster cores renders the spatial subhalo distribution substantially flatter than that of the dark matter .",
    "the non - detection of gamma rays from clusters puts firm upper limits on the dark - matter annihilation cross section and on the decay time of the dark - matter particles .",
    "as we have described in some detail above , clusters as well as their substructures are expected to have universal density profiles according to numerical simulations . despite many attempts to understand which physical processes shape this profile in absence of an equilibrium state , it is probably fair to say that a fundamental reason has not been found yet .",
    "two main theoretical concepts have so far been discussed as possible explanations .",
    "one relies on the assembly of haloes from smaller haloes and the importance of the merging processes and rates involved @xcite .",
    "if @xmath40 is the slope of the dark - matter power spectrum near the scale corresponding to the halo mass considered , then halo density profiles should be power laws with slope @xmath89 .",
    "for @xmath90 as appropriate for cluster - sized haloes , slopes near @xmath5 can be achieved , as simulations find them near the cores of dark - matter haloes .",
    "since the universal profile is found for haloes with masses spanning several orders of magnitude , haloes of galaxy mass for which @xmath40 approaches @xmath11 should have flatter cores than haloes of cluster mass , which is contrary to other claims based on simulations @xcite .",
    "moreover , halo mergers are important for this scenario , which are frequent in any bottom - up hierarchical scenario of structure formation such as cold dark matter ( see fig .  [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "simulations undertaken with hot dark matter , in which structure formation proceeds from the top down and mergers are rare , however , produce haloes with the same universal density profile , but with an inverted concentration - mass relation .",
    "mergers can therefore not be essential for the formation of the universal profile @xcite .",
    "another extensively discussed concept relies on the secondary - infall model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent example ) , which essentially rests on the fact that the so - called radial action is an adiabatic invariant . generally , for a mechanical system with a hamiltonian function varying slowly compared to the orbital time , the quantity @xmath91 is invariant in the adiabatic approximation , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the vectors of the generalised coordinates and their conjugate momenta .",
    "particles of mass @xmath94 on circular orbits in the potential of a spherically - symmetric mass @xmath95 , for example , have circular velocities @xmath96 for their orbits , therefore , the quantity @xmath97 is invariant while the potential changes adiabatically . for matter orbiting in existing potential wells that deepen slowly by accreting matter from their environment ,",
    "the square root of the radius times the mass is adiabatically invariant .",
    "while this assumption yields density profiles approximating the universal profile , the scatter due to varying initial conditions and angular momenta is large . besides , orbital times are of order @xmath98 while the time scale for changes in the potential may be as fast as the free - fall time scale , @xmath99 which is of the same order as the orbital time .",
    "this sheds doubt on the adiabatic assumption at least in such circumstances when rapid mergers change the potential on a short time scale comparable to the free - fall time scale .",
    "other discussions begin by postulating a certain phase - space structure of the dark - matter halo particles , for example a power law in the ratio @xmath100 between the density and the velocity dispersion @xmath101 @xcite . among others ,",
    "the jeans equation then admits constrained solutions which may come near the universal profile , but then the origin of the initial phase - space structure remains unexplained .    of course , this brief discussion can not do justice to the many efforts to explain the fundamental problem why a physical process without an equilibrium state should reveal universal behaviour , but it may serve to illustrate why the mere existence of a universal profile , quite irrespective of its details , raises conceptually important questions that have so far escaped a fundamental explanation .",
    "comparably fundamental may be the concentration parameter which controls the shape of the universal profile .",
    "simulations show that it should decrease with mass quite slowly , @xmath102 or similar , and more steeply on redshift .",
    "it should be mentioned that there is at least one simulation @xcite claiming that the concentration - mass relation be non - monotonic , increasing towards high masses . at the time of writing of this review , it is yet unclear why this result disagrees with virtually all other simulations of dark - matter haloes , and whether it may be seen as an artefact of interpretation .     with redshift according to the same algorithms .",
    "( @xcite ; see @xcite for some other examples),title=\"fig : \" ]   with redshift according to the same algorithms .",
    "( @xcite ; see @xcite for some other examples),title=\"fig : \" ]    the decrease of the concentration with mass is generally explained as a reflection of halo formation time .",
    "as mentioned above , it is assumed that halo cores preserve the mean cosmic density at the time of their formation , which at least qualitatively reproduces the trend seen in simulations of hierarchical models of structure formation such as cold dark matter : massive haloes form later and should thus have lower concentrations .",
    "this is supported by the finding that the concentration - mass relation is inverted in top - down formation scenarios occurring in warm dark - matter models @xcite .    as is detailed elsewhere ( see the review by ettori et al . in this volume ) , some measured concentrations disagree strongly with those expected from the concentrations - mass relations found in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "in particular , concentrations derived from strong gravitational lensing tend to be substantially and significantly higher for massive clusters , sometimes more than twice as high . for massive clusters , concentrations around @xmath103",
    "should be found , as fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] shows . at fixed mass ,",
    "concentrations of simulated haloes have a log - normal distribution with a standard deviation of @xmath104 , corresponding to typical relative concentration fluctuations of @xmath105 per cent around the mean .",
    "concentrations as high as those routinely found in strongly - lensing clusters are difficult to understand since they can hardly be accommodated with the standard @xmath60cdm cosmological model .",
    "baryonic physics and feedback processes in cluster cores may affect the expected concentrations , though , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "they find that higher concentrations occur if baryonic cooling is taken into account , while agn feedback brings the concentrations back near the range expected without baryons .",
    "however , a substantial concentration bias can be expected in galaxy - cluster samples selected for their strong - lensing effects .",
    "selecting strongly gravitationally lensing cluster - sized haloes in simulations , @xcite find that such clusters have concentrations tend to have concentrations higher by @xmath106 than average . taking this bias into account",
    ", @xcite find that their high concentrations derived from strong and weak lensing in four similar clusters maybe compatible with theoretical expectations",
    ".    however , high concentrations in clusters are not an unanimous result .",
    "some strong - lensing studies , sometimes even of the same clusters from which high concentrations had been inferred , find concentrations in the expected range @xcite . in a strong - lensing analysis of 12 clusters at redshift @xmath107 from the massive clusters survey ( macs ) ,",
    "@xcite find good agreement of the measured concentrations with theoretical expectations if the possible triaxiality of the cluster mass distribution is taken into account , even though their effective einstein radii are still substantially higher than expected for @xmath60cdm . to further complicate the picture ,",
    "concentrations inferred from weak gravitational lensing generally seem to reproduce the expected concentrations well .",
    "to give just two recent and possibly extreme examples , @xcite find a concentration of @xmath108 from a weak - lensing analysis of the cluster xmmu j1230.3@xmath1091339 at @xmath110 .",
    "@xcite analyse the concentration - mass relation with weak gravitational lensing in 30 x - ray luminous clusters .",
    "they find a fairly steep dependence of the concentrations on mass , @xmath111 , but the inferred concentration of @xmath112 for clusters with a virial mass near @xmath113 are just as expected .",
    "yet another result is found by @xcite , who find concentrations lower than expected in a large sample of haloes from a wide mass range analysed by weak lensing . using numerical simulations ,",
    "@xcite find that the concentrations expected to be measured from weak lensing should be slightly biased low .",
    "in contrast to gravitational lensing , x - ray observations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and interpretations of galaxy kinematics in clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) typically find good agreement between measured and expected concentrations , in particular for clusters considered relaxed , albeit with considerable scatter .",
    "detailed analyses of cluster cores based on x - ray data or on lensing data combined with the stellar dynamics in the central cluster galaxy find a large spread of density profiles , ranging from noticeably steeper than nfw @xcite to considerably flatter @xcite .",
    "clearly , no final word can yet be said on the central density profiles of clusters .",
    "an outstanding example of a cluster showing an nfw density profile is abell  2261 @xcite , observed within the clash programme @xcite .",
    "many recipes exist giving empirical descriptions of the concentration - mass relation . a selection of them is displayed in fig .  [ fig:6 ] .",
    "typically , they define a halo - formation redshift as the redshift when a certain fraction of the final halo mass was assembled , and relate the halo core density to the mean cosmic density at that redshift .",
    "several of these recipes @xcite are found to fit the mass - concentration relations of simulated haloes quite well , at least in certain wide mass and redshift ranges .",
    "however , the formation redshifts defined that way have to be very high for the simulated concentration - mass relation to be explained .",
    "apparently , not more than a few per cent of the final halo mass need to be assembled when the final core density of the forming halo is imprinted . at the very least ,",
    "this is an astonishing finding that should ultimately be understood .",
    "another difficulty related to the halo concentrations has to do with the so - called halo model of non - linear cosmic structure formation .",
    "it assumes that all cosmic structures are composed of haloes whose two - point correlation defines the power spectrum on large scales , while the small - scale power spectrum is given by the mass auto - correlation inside individual haloes .",
    "this being so , the internal density structure of individual haloes is an important ingredient of the halo model .",
    "however , for reproducing the non - linear , small - scale power spectrum found in numerical simulations , concentration - mass relations typically have to be assumed which are substantially steeper functions of mass than found by direct measurement in the very same simulation data .",
    "it seems that this substantial discrepancy can be solved by taking into account that haloes are substructured and thus contain a hierarchy of lower - mass haloes @xcite .",
    "it can be shown analytically @xcite that cosmic structure formation by gravitational collapse from an initially gaussian random field has to proceed in an anisotropic way .",
    "the probability for any pair of eigenvalues of the so - called zeldovich deformation tensor to be equal vanishes identically , hence structures have to evolve towards triaxial bodies at least well into the mildly non - linear regime .",
    "it is thus natural to expect that the shape of dark - matter haloes should approximate triaxial ellipsoids characterised by two axis ratios , called the ellipticity and the prolaticity , for the statistical distribution of which any structure - formation scenario based on an gaussian initial conditions makes specific predictions .",
    "modelling of strong gravitational lensing ( see there ) shows that triaxial haloes can better fit the gravitational - lensing effects simultaneously with the x - ray emission of galaxy clusters , and the axis ratios found that way are generally in a reasonable range .",
    "the brief review given so far shows that the core structure of galaxy clusters poses a number of substantial problems , some of which are likely to reach far into fundamental physics .",

( 2 ) do the density profiles of galaxy clusters adopt the shape found in numerical simulations ? ( 3 ) how concentrated is the dark matter in their cores ? ( 4 ) are galaxy clusters as substructured as expected for haloes formed from cold dark matter ? ( 5 ) are clusters as triaxial as they are expected to be ?    questions ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and possibly ( 3 ) address the fundamentally unsolved problem of what controls the non - equilibrium dynamics in of self - gravitating systems .",
    "question ( 3 ) may be , question ( 4 ) certainly is related to the properties of the yet hypothetical , presumably weakly interacting , possibly annihilating dark - matter particle .",
    "question ( 5 ) pertains our understanding of cosmic structure formation as being due to gravitational collapse from a gaussian random field of density fluctuations .",
    "in the centres of galaxy clusters , the mass fraction of baryons becomes significant .",
    "whether it is large enough to substantially alter the properties of the dark matter `` backbone '' we do not know , but it is clear that one has to consider the influence of processes such as radiative cooling , heating and other feedback processes from baryons to dark matter when simulating cluster physics .",
    "various processes act on scales that are orders of magnitude apart , which renders the simulation of the physics in cluster cores complicated .",
    "this is the reason why currently only approximate simulations of the conditions in cluster centres are available .    similarly , the interpretation of observations is not easy .",
    "an outstanding example of the complications encountered in cluster centres is the perseus cluster ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "the final section of this review sketches a possible approach based not on the mass or the mass density , but on the gravitational potential .      in the approximation relevant for our purposes , gravitational lensing",
    "is not affected by the physical state of the matter and energy distribution inside the lensing object .",
    "it thus provides perhaps the most reliable techniques for analysing the actual mass distribution in clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "problems are generated by ambiguities due to _ a priori _ unknown degrees of asymmetry , line - of - sight projection effects and the limited range of constraints in particular by strong gravitational lensing .",
    "strong lensing is being exposed in detail elsewhere in this volume .",
    "the main statements explained there are as follows : strong lensing occurs with sources close to caustic curves , their images occur near critical curves .",
    "two types of critical curve can be distinguished by the direction into which images are preferentially stretched .",
    "tangential critical curves constrain the total projected amount of mass enclosed by them , albeit that mass is scaled by the critical surface mass density which depends on cosmology and sometimes unknown redshifts",
    ". radial critical curves , which are typically surrounded by the tangential critical curves , constrain the local slope of the density profile .",
    "the most prominent phenomena of strong gravitational lensing are tangential and radial arcs .",
    "the latter are difficult to find since they occur near cluster cores , where they may be overshone by the central cluster galaxies .",
    "arcs trace or straddle the critical curves they are caused by .",
    "multiple images , which are much more frequent than arcs , also constrain the locations of the critical curves .",
    "one might think that strong lensing should constrain the core structure of galaxy clusters quite well .",
    "however , this is not the case if model - independent constraints are sought . since all phenomena of strong lensing rely in some way or another on the occurrence and the locations of critical curves , all the information they provide concern the local curvature of the effective lensing potential .",
    "strong - lensing observables can fix parametric mass models quite tightly , but they rarely allow model - independent statements on their own .    weak gravitational lensing ( cf .",
    "* ) weakly distorts the images of background galaxies .",
    "to lowest order , weak lensing imprints an ellipticity on background sources characterised by the local strength of the gravitational tidal field or shear @xmath124 and the scaled surface - mass density or convergence @xmath125 .",
    "both @xmath125 and @xmath124 are linear combinations of the effective gravitational potential @xmath126 .",
    "the shear has two components , @xmath127 which can conveniently be combined to form the real and imaginary parts of the complex shear @xmath128 .",
    "the convergence @xmath125 is half the laplacian of @xmath126 , @xmath129 to lowest - order approximation of weak lensing , idealised , circular sources appear as elliptical images .",
    "let @xmath130 and @xmath131 be the semi - major and semi - minor axes of such an ellipse , then its ellipticity @xmath132 is approximately given by the so - called reduced shear @xmath133 rather than the shear itself , @xmath134    circular sources are rare if they exist at all , but can be approximately created by averaging over sufficiently many background sources if their intrinsic shapes are random and uncorrelated .",
    "thus , weak - lensing effects have to be inferred in a statistical way by measuring the net ellipticity after averaging over images .",
    "this immediately implies that weak lensing has an intrinsic resolution limit set by the mean number density @xmath40 per solid angle of background sources . if @xmath135 galaxies should be averaged over , they need to be collected within a finite solid angle whose radius @xmath136 defines the angular resolution",
    ". the condition @xmath137 requires @xmath138 typical numbers are @xmath139 and @xmath140 , giving @xmath141 .",
    "the resolution limit of weak - lensing observations thus turns out to be of the same order as the typical angular extent of the critical curves .",
    "strong - lensing observables thus constrain effective cluster potentials on scales at or below the angular resolution provided by weak - lensing observables . if they are to be combined , and they need to be in order to constrain the core structure of galaxy clusters in a model - independent way , a multi - scale approach is required .",
    "such multi - scale approaches have been developed and applied @xcite .",
    "in essence , they map the effective lensing potential on a grid with a resolution adapted to the observed constraints , derive its lensing properties by discrete differentiation and vary the gridded potential values such that a suitable total likelihood is minimised .",
    "this likelihood contains terms from strong and weak lensing .",
    "it expresses the expectation that the reconstructed lensing potential should recover the measured mean ellipticities and the location of the critical curves traced by any strong - lensing phenomena .",
    "simulations show that such parameter - free , adaptive - grid methods recover the density profiles and the total cluster masses very well @xcite .",
    "multiple images constrain the deflection angle near critical curves , and thus the gradient of the lensing potential .",
    "as described elsewhere , critical curves are located where the determinant of the jacobian matrix vanishes , which essentially provides a constraint on the matrix of second derivatives ( the hessian matrix ) of the lensing potential .",
    "the gravitational shear measured from elliptical distortions constrains another combination of second - order derivatives of @xmath126 .",
    "the different degrees of derivatives entering these constraints are conceptually important since the trace the lensing potential on different scales : the higher the derivative of the potential is that underlies an observable , the smaller are the scales that the respective observable is sensitive to . aiming at the core structure and the amount of substructures in clusters , combining observables which are sensitive on different scales is conceptually important .",
    "can third - order derivatives of the lensing potential be used ?",
    "their effect can straightforwardly be derived in the following way @xcite .",
    "combine the derivatives with respect to the two spatial directions into one complex - valued differentiation operator @xmath142 and its complex conjugate @xmath143 , @xmath144 the convergence and the shear can then simply be written as @xmath145 further differentiation defines the two flexion components @xmath146 and @xmath147 , @xmath148 with both @xmath146 and @xmath147 being complex numbers .",
    "expressed in components , we have @xmath149 and @xmath150 from the construction of the flexion components , it is quite easily seen that @xmath146 and @xmath147 create images with one- and three - fold rotational symmetry from circular sources , respectively .",
    "such images are said to have spin-1 and spin-3 . while the spin-1 image distortion due to the @xmath146 flexion causes a centroid shift which may be hard to recognise observationally , the spin-3 distortion due to the @xmath147 flexion imprints a characteristic triangular shape .",
    "faint galaxies tend to appear intrinsically elliptical .",
    "the gravitational shear , adding elliptical distortion , thus has to be detected on top of the intrinsic galaxy ellipticity .",
    "in contrast , since there should be little or no intrinsic triangular morphology in galaxies , the triangular distortion due to the @xmath147 flexion should be measurable with much lower intrinsic noise than the shear , and much less systematic uncertainty than the centroid shift caused by the @xmath146 flexion .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio specifically of the @xmath147 flexion may thus be comparable to that of the shear , even though the signal itself is expected to be weaker .    to give an order of magnitude , consider the simple lens model of an isothermal sphere , whose intrinsic , three - dimensional density profile is proportional to @xmath151 .",
    "its convergence and the absolute value of the shear are given by @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the einstein radius .",
    "clearly , @xmath125 and @xmath124 are dimension - less .",
    "the @xmath146 and @xmath147 flexions have the amplitude @xmath154 and the dimension of an inverse angle .",
    "their signal , measured across an image of characteristic angular scale @xmath155 , is thus estimated to be @xmath156 lower by a factor @xmath157 than the shear signal .",
    "this factor is should fall between @xmath158 and @xmath159 for typical weakly - lensed images .",
    "it is not clear yet whether it will be possible to reliably measure flexion in galaxy clusters .",
    "some pioneering attempts have been made which found hints at @xmath146 rather than @xmath147 flexion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , flexion can only be measured if a reliable estimate for the shear already exists because any spin-1 or spin-3 quantity that can be derived from observations of galaxies not only picks up the flexion signal , but combinations of flexion and shear @xcite",
    ". considerable work on shape measurements of galaxies and their interpretation still needs to be done before flexion can be considered measurable .",
    "if flexion can be determined , however , it promises to add small - scale information on the internal structure of galaxy clusters that the shear alone can not resolve .",
    "the essential message from this subsection is two - fold : gravitational lensing primarily provides information on the second - order derivatives of the gravitational potential .",
    "this is necessarily so because of the equivalence principle : it is not the gravitational field that can be invariantly measured , but the gravitational tidal field , which is in the weak - field limit represented by the hessian of the newtonian potential . should flexion become reliably measurable , it would allow quantifying changes in the tidal field , supplying smaller - scale information than the gravitational shear , the magnification and critical curves can provide .",
    "lensing observables thus constrain the projected gravitational potential by its curvature and possibly higher - order derivatives .",
    "gravitational lensing returns an estimate for the projected newtonian potential up to harmonic functions .",
    "x - ray emission by thermal bremsstrahlung can also be analysed in terms of the gravitational potential . to illustrate this statement ,",

    "the relation ( [ eq:34 ] ) that we have derived between the x - ray emissivity by thermal bremsstrahlung and the newtonian potential suggests a path from the x - ray surface brightness @xmath177 to the projected gravitational potential , thus connecting x - ray emission and gravitational lensing on a common ground . by means of richardson - lucy deprojection",
    ", an iterative scheme can be constructed allowing to recover the three - dimensional x - ray emissivity @xmath178 from @xmath177 .",
    "the richardson - lucy deprojection rests on bayes theorem and returns , usually with a regularisation term suppressing noise overfitting , a three - dimensional function from its two - dimensional projection , provided a known projection kernel .",
    "notice that we have not applied any symmetry assumptions on the x - ray emissiting cluster so far .",
    "the integration of the hydrostatic equation leading to ( [ eq:32 ] ) and thus also to ( [ eq:33 ] ) is possible without adopting a particular symmetry .",
    "this has to be given up now before richardson - lucy deprojection can be applied because the projection kernel depends on the symmetry of the three - dimensional shape assumed for the body of the hot intracluster gas . assuming a reasonable symmetry ( which by no means has to be spherical )",
    ", richardson - lucy deprojection returns an estimate for @xmath178 from the observed @xmath177 .",

    "notice that the expression on the left - hand side of ( [ eq:36 ] ) is dimension - less since the potential is scaled by the squared thermal velocity @xmath181 , which can again be estimated from the measured temperature and an assumed mean gas - particle mass .",

    "the main result of the last two subsections is that the observables provided by the hot intracluster gas can directly be converted to constrain the projected newtonian potential .",
    "this allows combining all related observables ",
    "strong lensing , weak lensing possibly including flexion , x - ray emission and the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect  into one @xmath189 function returning a joint estimate for the projected cluster potential .",
    "one observable remains , which is related to the kinematics of the cluster galaxies .",
    "assuming spherical symmetry in the jeans equation , we can write @xmath190 where @xmath40 is the spatial number density of the galaxies , @xmath191 is their radial velocity dispersion , and @xmath192 is the usual anisotropy parameter of the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "we shall later assume for simplicity that the number density @xmath40 is proportional to the matter density @xmath160 .    instead of the usual approach , which would consist in solving ( [ eq:41 ] ) to arrive at a fairly involved integral relation between @xmath193 and @xmath194 for given @xmath195",

    "now , the line - of - sight integrated `` galaxy pressure '' is the observable line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath202 , weighted by the galaxy number density .",
    "again , by means of richardson - lucy deprojection , this observable can be converted to the three - dimensional `` galaxy pressure '' @xmath203 , thus providing the measureable source term in the volterra integral equation for the gravitational potential @xmath162 .",
    "this can then be solved by a standard , iterative procedure .",
    "the three - dimensional potential obtained this way can finally also be projected along the line - of - sight to return the projected gravitational potential @xmath126 .",
