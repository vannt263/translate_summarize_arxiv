    "the underlying assumption of the marshallian model is that the @xmath0  firm in a competitive industry does not react strategically to the hypothetical actions of other firms . in an @xmath1 firm industry where the output of the @xmath0 firm is @xmath2 , this assumption , known as",
    "atomism  or price - taking,@xcite means that @xmath3  @xmath4 .",
    "this model then claims that the market demand function @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 ) has the dual properties that @xmath7 and @xmath8 for large @xmath1 .",
    "elementary calculus shows this is false : @xmath9    where @xmath10 given @xmath11  @xmath4 .",
    "therefore @xmath12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this false belief is essential to the marshallian derivation of the model of perfect competition , which occurs when @xmath5the marginal benefit to society  equals the marginal cost of production @xmath13.@xcite the derivation starts from the proposition that a profit maximizing firm will produce where its marginal cost @xmath14 equals its marginal  revenue @xmath15 : @xmath16    given this alleged profit - maximization rule and the assumption  that @xmath17 , it followed that for perfect competition , price equalled marginal cost .",
    "since the assumption is logically incompatible with @xmath7 , the marshallian derivation of perfect competition fails .",
    "the cournot - nash model is not dependent on this fallacy , arguing instead that strategic interactions lead to a nash equilibrium in which market price converges to marginal cost as the number of firms increases ( @xcite ; @xcite)though this process is , at best , highly conditional at best ( see @xcite ) .",
    "standard neoclassical analysis assumes that firms _ will _ strategically interact , and calculates the @xmath0 firm s best response on this basis under various conditions .",
    "we instead treat @xmath18 , the response of the @xmath0 firm to a hypothetical change in output by the @xmath19 , as a decision variable , and consider what is its optimal value of @xmath18 for a profit - maximizing firm . as a preliminary ,",
    "we show that the proposition that ( [ profitmaxcournot ] ) maximizes profits for the @xmath0 firm is false .",
    "in a multi - firm industry , the profit maximum is given by the zero , not of its _ partial _ derivative , but its _ total _ derivative  since the actions of other firms affect the profitability of any given firm , even though ( or rather , especially because ) the @xmath0 firm can not control what the other firms in the industry do",
    ". maximizing profit while ignoring what other firms do is rather like rowing a boat to a specific location while ignoring the wind and tides .",
    "the profit maximum for the @xmath0 firm is therefore given by : @xmath20    since @xmath21 , ( [ profitmaxcondition ] ) can be expanded to @xmath22    converting ( [ profitmaxconditionexpanded ] ) into an expression in terms of reaction coefficients @xmath18 yields : @xmath23 with the marshallian assumption of atomism , @xmath24 @xmath4 , and equation ( [ generalprofitmaximum ] ) reduces to @xmath25    this contradicts the neoclassical belief , epitomized by ( [ profitmaxcournot ] ) ,  that , in the context of atomistic behavior , profit is maximized by equating marginal revenue and marginal cost .",
    "( [ profitmaximumthetazero ] )  can be rearranged to yield : @xmath26    this equals zero only in the case of a monopoly  which is the one time that the accepted marshallian formula is correct . at all other times ,",
    "the profit maximum for an individual firm will occur where marginal revenue  _ exceeds _ marginal cost . as a consequence",
    ", the marshallian model leads to industry output being independent of the number of firms in it .    in cournot - nash game",
    "theoretic analysis , firms decide their own actions on the basis of the expected reactions of other firms , in such a way that each firm s best response  is to set @xmath27 . in our terms , this is equivalent to setting @xmath28where e is the market elasticity of demand ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "our equation ( [ generalprofitmaximum ] ) lets us combine marshallian and cournot - nash analysis , by treating @xmath18 as a decision variable whose optimum value can be identified by the firm . in this paper , we consider an industry of @xmath1 identical firms ( a common heuristic device in economic theory ) so that @xmath30  @xmath4 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32  can take on any value",
    ". then ( [ generalprofitmaximum ] ) reduces to : @xmath33    this defines the maximum profit achievable by the individual firm in the context of strategic behavior  if each firm reacts to output changes by other firms with a reaction coefficient of @xmath32 .",
    "we can now consider what value of @xmath32  would be chosen by a profit - maximizing firm .",
    "it transpires that the optimum value of this parameter is in fact zero .",
    "the optimum value for @xmath32 for the @xmath0 firm occurs where @xmath34 .",
    "this condition reduces to : @xmath35    since it can be shown that @xmath36 , ( [ profitmaxwrttheta ] ) equals zero iff @xmath37 .",
    "as established above , this requires that @xmath38 .",
    "firms thus achieve higher profits if they _ do not _ react strategically to each other . in the classic words of the movie _ war  games _",
    ", firms may conclude that cournot - nash strategic interaction is a curious game .",
    "the only winning strategy is not to play .",
    "we consider this question using a multi - agent model of instrumentally rational profit maximizers facing comparable marginal cost functions .",

    "firm @xmath40 chooses an initial output level @xmath41 and a fixed amount by which to vary output at each step @xmath42 .",

    "[ ptbh ]    keenfig01.eps    however , as @xmath55 rises from 1% to 20% of the cournot prediction , the outcome shifts from the keen to the cournot level ( figure [ dispersalrisingmc ] ) .",
    "aggregate and individual agent behavior also becomes much more unstable , as figure [ comparison_dq_firms ] indicates .",
    "we surmise that the emergent collusion  we identified in @xcite  breaks down as @xmath56 rises ; perhaps the increasing size of unpredictable output changes by other firms makes the overall market environment more chaotic , forcing each firm to rely more on feedback from its own output.changes .",

    "contrary to the beliefs of the vast majority of economists , equating marginal revenue and marginal cost is not profit - maximizing behavior , the number of firms in an industry has no discernible impact on the quantity produced , the deadweight loss of welfare  exists regardless of how many firms there are in the industry , and instrumentally rational profit - maximizers do not play cournot - nash games . moving from hollywood to the bard , it appears that the dominant theory of the firm is much ado about nothing .",
