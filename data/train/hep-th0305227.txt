    "many of the great successes of modern field theory , classical and quantum , are undoubtedly due to the use of topological methods . indeed , these methods did not only help classifying and subdividing the set of solutions of the field equations , as e.g. in monopole @xcite and instanton @xcite theory , but they also generated unexpected new relationships between apparently unrelated branches in particle theory ; e.g. it has been observed within the framework of the string theories that the chern - simons theory , as a quantum field theory in three dimensions , is intimately related to the invariants of knots and links @xcite which first had been discussed from a purely mathematical point of view @xcite . the list of examples of a fruitful cooperation of topology and physics could easily be continued but may be sufficient here in order to demonstrate the significance of topological investigations of physical theories .",
    "the present paper is also concerned with such a topological goal , namely to elaborate the topological invariants which are encoded into the hamiltonian of the @xmath2 realization of _ relativistic schrdinger theory ( rst ) _ , a recently established alternative approach to relativistic many - particle quantum mechanics @xcite ( for a critical discussion of some of the deficiencies of the conventional bethe - salpeter equation see ref .",
    "the present new approach works for an arbitrary number of scalar @xcite and spin particles @xcite , but for the present purposes we restrict ourselves to a scalar two - particle system which requires the @xmath2 realization of rst .",
    "this means that the rst wave functions @xmath3 constitute a section of a complex vector - bundle over space - time as the base space and the two - dimensional complex plane @xmath2 as the typical fibre .",
    "such a construction clearly displays the main difference to the conventional approach where the hilbert space of a two - particle system is taken as the tensor product of the one - particle spaces , whereas in rst one takes the whitney sum of the single - particle bundles .",
    "thus the latter construction suggests a fluid - dynamic interpretation of the formalism in contrast to the conventional approach whose tensor - product construction rather meets with born s probabilistic interpretation",
    ".    now it should be evident that such differences in the mathematical formalism necessarily will imply also different descriptions of the physical phenomena .",
    "for the present topological context , the phenomenon of _ entanglement _ becomes important . in the conventional theory ,",
    "an entangled @xmath4-particle system requires the use of either the symmetric or anti - symmetric wave functions @xmath5 , see e.g. equation ( [ e3:3 ] ) below . for the relativisitic treatment ,",
    "this automatically would introduce @xmath4 time variables @xmath6 for such a quantum state @xmath7 which makes its physical interpretation somewhat obscure ( however in the non - relativistic limit , there are no such problems and one may interpret the ( anti-)symmetrization postulate simply as a modification of the topology of the configuration space @xcite ) . naturally , for the whitney sum construction such a process of ( anti-)symmetrization is not feasible because the @xmath4-particle wave function @xmath3 remains an object defined at any event @xmath8 of the underlying space - time .",
    "consequently the conventional matter dichotomy of ( anti-)symmetric states must be incorporated into rst in a different way , namely in form of the positive and negative _",
    "mixtures_. it has already been observed that the physical properties of positive rst mixtures resemble the symmetrized states of the conventional theory whereas the negative mixtures appear as the rst counterpart of the anti - symmetrized conventional states @xcite .",
    "thus , in view of such a physical and mathematical dichotomy of the rst solutions , one naturally asks whether perhaps those positive and negative rst mixtures carry different topological features in analogy to the topological modification of the conventional configuration space @xcite .",
    "subsequently these questions are studied in detail and the results are the following : the positive mixtures carry a pair of topological quantum numbers ( `` winding numbers '' ) which are either even or odd , whereas the negative mixtures have always trivial winding numbers .",
    "this comes about because the positive mixtures induce a map from space - time onto the ( compact ) group @xmath0 whereas the corresponding map of the negative mixtures refers to the ( non - compact ) group @xmath1 .",
    "clearly the winding number of negative mixtures , as the value of the pullback of the invariant volume form over @xmath1 upon some three - cycle @xmath9 of space - time , must necessarily produce a trivial result ; whereas for the compact case @xmath0 one observes the emergence of a pair of even or odd winding numbers .",
    "the procedure to obtain these results is the following : in * sect .",
    "ii * , the general theory is briefly sketched for the sake of sufficient self - containment of the paper .",
    "iii * then presents the specialization of the general formalism to the two - particle case to be treated during the remainder of the paper . here",
    ", the emphasis lies on the right parametrization of the theory : it is true , the wave function parametrization reveals the fact that the general two - particle mixture may be described in terms of four single - particle klein - gordon wave functions @xmath10 , @xmath11 ; @xmath12 , @xmath13 cf .",
    "equations ( [ e3:70 ] ) .",
    "these four wave functions undergo ( @xmath14)-pairing such that either pair @xmath10 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath13 builds up a four - current @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 $ ] as the sources of some vector potential @xmath19 and @xmath20 which then enters the covariant derivatives for the members of the other pair , ( [ e3:66])-([e3:67 ] ) .",
    "however such a wave function parametrization is extremely ineffective for the purpose of detecting the topological peculiarities of the theory , and therefore one resorts to the parametrization in terms of _ exchange fields_. the point here is that either of the two particle degrees of freedom can be equipped by its own triplet of exchange fields @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) so that the corresponding dynamical equations become decoupled , see the source equations ( [ e3:36 ] ) and the curl equations ( [ e3:37 ] ) .",
    "the entanglement of both particles arises now as an _ algebraic _ constraint upon the two sets of exchange fields , cf .",
    "( [ e3:40])-([e3:41 ] ) .",
    "the advantage of such a parametrization in terms of exchange fields is made evident in * sect .",
    "iv * , where the curl equations for the exchange fields are identified with the maurer - cartan structure equations over the `` exchange groups '' , namely the compact @xmath25 for the positive mixtures and the non - compact @xmath26 for the negative mixtures .",
    "consequently the rst exchange fields can be thought to be generated by some map from space - time to the corresponding exchange group so that their curl equations ( [ e3:37 ] ) are automatically satisfied and it remains to obey the source equations ( [ e3:36 ] ) together with the exchange coupling conditions ( [ e3:20])-([e3:21 ] ) .",
    "the latter condition can be satisfied by coupling the group elements @xmath27 for both particles ( @xmath24 ) in the right way . for this purpose",
    "one has to look for a convenient parametrization of the exchange groups so that the exchange coupling condition adopts a simple form in terms of the selected group parameters . in this context , the optimal parametrization is achieved in terms of the well - known euler angles @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 relative to which the exchange coupling condition is expressed in an almost trivial way , cf .",
    "equation ( [ e4:28 ] ) .",
    "however for the purpose of attaining a concrete geometric picture of the emergence of topological quantum numbers ( * sect .",
    "v * ) , it is more instructive to resort to the universal covering groups , i.e. @xmath0 for the positive mixtures ( and @xmath1 for the negative mixtures ) .",
    "the reason is that the group @xmath0 is topologically equivalent to the 3-sphere @xmath31 and therefore also to the 3-cycles @xmath9 of space - time . on the other hand ,",
    "both sets of exchange fields induce a map @xmath32 from space - time into the exchange group , i.e. @xmath33 for the positive mixtures , and thereby associate two winding numbers @xmath34 ( @xmath24 ) ( [ e5:14 ] ) to any three - cycle @xmath9 as the number of times this cycle is wound onto the exchange group . since the exchange fields are constituents of the hamiltonian @xmath35 , the pair of winding numbers @xmath34 are a topological characteristic of the hamiltonian .",
    "as expected , the exchange coupling condition between both particle degrees of freedom should establish some correlation between the winding numbers , but this correlation turns out to be so weak that it simply results in the property of both winding numbers being either odd or even . as an example of a non - trivial exchange field configuration , with unit winding numbers , the method of stereographic projection is applied ( * sect .",
    "vi * ) which compactifies the euclidean 3-space @xmath36 ( as a time - slice of space - time ) to @xmath31 by one - point compactification .",
    "one of the crucial points for the subsequent topological discussions refers to an adequate parametrization of the rst field system .",
    "the reason for this is that the topological characteristics of the solutions become manifest only through an adequate choice of the field variables , whereas the general rst dynamics ( in operator form ) does itself not suggest such a preferred choice .",
    "therefore we briefly list the key features of the general rst dynamics and then concentrate upon a certain parametrization being most helpful for the present topological purposes .",
    "the basic building blocks of the theory consist of ( i ) the matter dynamics , ( ii ) hamiltonian dynamics , and ( iii ) gauge field dynamics @xcite . restricting ourselves here to a system of @xmath4 scalar particles",
    ", one uses an @xmath4-component wave function @xmath37 when the particles are `` disentangled '' but one resorts to an hermitian @xmath38 matrix @xmath39 for the `` entangled '' ( i.e. mixture ) situation .",
    "the motion of matter is then governed by the relativistic schrdinger equation ( rse ) for the wave function @xmath37 @xmath40 or by the relativistic von neumann equation ( rne ) for the `` _ intensity matix _ '' @xmath39 @xmath41\\;,\\ ] ] which constitutes the `` _ matter dynamics _ '' .",

    "observe here that these dynamically disconnected two types of rst mixtures ( @xmath121 ) are implied by the rst dynamics itself , whereas their conventional analogue ( i.e. the interdiction of transitions between the symmetric and anti - symmetric states ) is an extra postulate which `` _ can not be deduced from the other principles of quantum mechanics _ '' @xcite . in this sense , rst is of less postulative character than the conventional theory .",

    "for instance , imagine that we want to look for static solutions where all rst fields become time - independent , e.g. think of the bound solutions in an attractive potential .",
    "for such a situation one expects that all scalar fields , such as the euler angles , can not depend upon time @xmath283 but will exclusively depend on the space position @xmath284 .",

    "therefore it is instructive to consider the three - vector parametrization in some detail .    the adjoint transformation @xmath294 @xmath295    ( @xmath296 )    acts over the groups @xmath297 and @xmath298 in a somewhat different way .",
    "since the three - vector @xmath299 changes under the transformation ( [ e4:38 ] ) according to @xmath300 where the matrix @xmath301 is identical to @xmath302 , the three - vector @xmath293 can be rotated into any direction in group space for @xmath25 but not for @xmath26 .",
    "the reason is that the killing metric @xmath221 ( [ e4:4 ] ) is invariant with respect to these transformations i.e. @xmath303 and therefore the `` length '' of the three - vector is preserved @xmath304 this condition does not restrict the possible end configurations of @xmath293 for @xmath25 but it does for @xmath26 . more concretely , since the killing metric @xmath253 ( [ e4:16 ] ) is indefinite for the negative mixtures ( @xmath119 ) , the three - vector @xmath293 can never cross the `` light - cone '' @xmath305 and thus the adjoint transformation ( [ e4:38 ] ) leaves invariant two three - dimensional subspaces in @xmath26 , namely those which have @xmath306 and @xmath307 .",

    "the three - vector @xmath293 parametrizing the group element @xmath237 ( [ e4:37 ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath237 itself in the following way : first extract the `` length '' @xmath312 of the three - vector through ( @xmath118 ) @xmath314 and then find the unit vector @xmath315 ( [ e4:43 ] ) through @xmath316 thus , referring to the euler parametrization of @xmath237 ( [ e4:19])-([e4:20 ] ) , yields the length of the three - vector @xmath293 in terms of the euler angles as ( @xmath118 ) @xmath317 and then the unit vector @xmath315 is found from ( [ e4:46 ] ) as ( @xmath118 )    [ e4:48 ] @xmath318    the advantage of working with both parametrizations comes now into play when we transcribe the exchange coupling condition between both particles from the euler parametrizations ( [ e4:28 ] ) , where this condition looks very simple , to the three - vector parametrizations for which that coupling condition would have never been found directly .",
    "thus , for the positive mixtures we obtain the three - vector @xmath293 in terms of the average euler angles @xmath319 and exchange angle @xmath162 by combining the present result ( [ e4:47])-([e4:48 ] ) with the former coupling conditions ( [ e4:28 ] ) in order to find for the first particle ( @xmath118 )    [ e4:52 ] @xmath320    and similarly for the second particle    [ e4:53 ] @xmath321",

    "this map induces identical winding numbers ( @xmath337 , say ) for both particles , as may be seen from the exchange coupling ( [ e4:28 ] ) .",

    "clearly , this goal can be achieved by eliminating the average euler angles @xmath336 , @xmath392 , @xmath393 from the three - vector parametrizations ( [ e4:52])-([e4:53 ] ) .",
    "the point of departure is here again a convenient reparametrization of the four - vector components @xmath391 so that the exchange coupling condition adopts a very simple shape when expressed in these new parameters .",
    "the key point is here a ( @xmath14)-splitting of the group space , i.e. we put for either particle ( @xmath24 )    [ e5:25 ] @xmath394    and thus consider the projections of the four - vectors @xmath391 into the ( @xmath395)-plane and the ( @xmath396)-plane . now for these projections one easily finds from the three - vector parametrization ( [ e4:52])-([e4:53 ] ) the following cross relations    [ e5:26 ] @xmath397    this means that when the projection of @xmath387 into the ( @xmath396)-plane is maximal , the corresponding projection of @xmath388 is minimal and vice versa .",
    "such an effect suggests to parametrize those projections in the following way ( first particle , @xmath398 )    [ e5:27 ] @xmath399    and similarly for the second particle ( @xmath400 )    [ e5:28 ] @xmath401    thus the remaining task is to reveal the exchange coupling condition upon the angles @xmath402 and @xmath403 in the corresponding two - planes .    in the next step ,",
    "the remaining two euler angles @xmath336 and @xmath393 are expressed by the four - vector components @xmath391 in the following way    [ e5:29 ] @xmath404    from here one recognizes immediately that the angles @xmath402 in the ( @xmath396)-plane are linked to the euler angles @xmath336 , @xmath393 as follows    [ e5:30 ] @xmath405    finally , the last step consists in eliminating one of the euler angles @xmath336 or @xmath393 from the first and second components",
    "@xmath406 , @xmath407 of both particles .",
    "thus , eliminating @xmath336 yields by use of ( [ e5:30 ] ) the following two equations    [ e5:31 ] @xmath408    and , similarly , eliminating @xmath393 yields    [ e5:32 ] @xmath409    clearly , both sets of equations ( [ e5:31 ] ) and ( [ e5:32 ] ) must be consistent when the former relationships are to be respected , which provides us with the final form of exchange coupling :    [ e5:33 ] @xmath410    this pleasant result allows us now to explicitly construct pairs of exchange fields which obey _ both _ the required curl relations _ and _ the exchange coupling conditions ! obviously we simply can _ choose _ one of both four - vectors @xmath411 over space time , say @xmath387 , and then the second four - vector @xmath388 is immediately given by equations ( [ e5:28 ] ) together with ( [ e5:33 ] ) . clearly the passage from the chosen @xmath387 to the second vector @xmath388",
    "is still parametrized by the exchange angle @xmath162 which however can also be chosen arbitrarily !",
    "this may be seen more explicitly by recasting the transition from the first particle ( [ e5:27 ] ) to the second particle ( [ e5:28 ] ) into the form of an @xmath412 rotation @xmath413 here the rotation matrix @xmath414 is given by two @xmath415 elements @xmath416 through @xmath417 with the @xmath415 element @xmath416 being given by @xmath418",
    "as the simplest demonstration of the present results , one may put to zero the exchange angle @xmath162 which then turns the @xmath412 matrix @xmath302 ( [ e5:34])-([e5:36 ] ) into a constant matrix @xmath419 @xmath420 for such a situation , both winding numbers @xmath34 ( [ e5:14 ] ) must necessarily coincide with the average winding number @xmath338 because the winding number @xmath337 ( [ e5:16]b ) is trivially zero .",
    "the coincidence of @xmath34 and @xmath338 may also be seen from the four - vector version ( [ e5:24 ] ) of the volume three - forms @xmath365 since the constant @xmath412 element @xmath419 escapes the exterior differentiation and just reproduces the @xmath412 invariant permutation tensor @xmath421 clearly @xmath422 because @xmath419 is an element of the proper rotation group .",
    "thus we are left with the problem of determining some differentiable four - vector field @xmath387 over space - time from which the second four - vector @xmath388 can then be simply constructed by means of the @xmath412 rotation @xmath419 ( [ e6:1 ] ) , cf .",
    "( [ e5:34 ] ) . here ,",
    "it is well - known that euclidean 3-space ( as a time slice of space - time @xmath423 ) can be compactified to the 3-sphere @xmath31 by stereographic projection @xcite .",
    "this procedure yields the following differentiable four - vector field @xmath411 over @xmath36 :      this immediately yields for the average euler angle @xmath392 ( [ e5:27 ] ) @xmath425 where spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath426 , @xmath427 , @xmath428 ) have been used in place of the cartesian parameters @xmath429 .",
    "hence for spatial infinity ( @xmath430 ) the four - vector @xmath387 points to the north pole of @xmath31 ( @xmath431 ) , and for the origin ( @xmath432 ) of @xmath36 to the south pole ( @xmath433 ) , see fig .",
    "2 .        observe here that the second four - vector @xmath388 ( [ e6:5 ] ) can not be made identical to the first one @xmath387 ( [ e6:3 ] ) , because the exchange coupling condition always requires a _ non - trivial _",
    "@xmath412 rotation @xmath302 ( [ e5:35 ] ) !      since for the present exchange configuration",
    "both winding numbers coincide with the average winding number @xmath338(@xmath435 ) , it may be sufficient here to consider only the first number @xmath436 . the corresponding volume three - form",
    "@xmath437 ( [ e5:23 ] ) reads @xmath438 where the three - vector length @xmath439 is obtained from the four - vector @xmath387 ( [ e5:18 ] ) through @xmath440 thus , when the four - vector @xmath387 is generated by stereographic projection as shown by equations ( [ e6:3 ] ) , one finds for @xmath439      i.e. we put @xmath442 for @xmath432 and @xmath443 for @xmath430 .",
    "furthermore , the unit three - vector @xmath444 simply becomes the normalized position vector of the euclidean three - plane ( @xmath423 ) @xmath445    consequently , the general volume form : @xmath437 ( [ e6:6 ] ) becomes specialized here to @xmath446 and obviously contains as its angular part the volume two - form over the sphere @xmath447 .",
    "the integrations can therefore be done in a straightforward way and yield the expected result for the winding number @xmath436 ( @xmath448 ) @xmath449 clearly the euclidean 3-space @xmath36 is wound up to the 3-sphere @xmath31 just once by the stereographic projection , whereby spatial infinity ( @xmath430 ) is mapped to the north pole ( which reverses the conventional orientation and gives a minus sign for the winding number ) .",
    "once the generating group elements @xmath27 of the @xmath0 form ( [ e5:19 ] ) have been determined with the corresponding four - vector parametrizations @xmath391 being displayed through equations ( [ e6:3 ] ) and ( [ e6:5 ] ) , it is an easy matter to compute the associated maurer - cartan forms @xmath281 .",
    "here it is convenient to resort to the three - vector parametrization ( [ e4:42 ] ) of the maurer - cartan forms where the length @xmath439 of the first three - vector @xmath450 ( [ e4:43 ] ) has been specified through equations ( [ e6:8 ] ) and the unit three - vector @xmath444 is given by ( [ e6:9 ] ) . with these prerequisites",
    "the maurer - cartan forms for the first particle are found to be of the following form @xmath451    concerning the maurer - cartan forms of the second particle @xmath452 , one can refer to their link ( [ e4:28_2 ] ) to the first particle s expressions @xmath453 with the present specialization of putting the exchange angle to zero .",

    "iii it has been made clear that the total set of rst variables can be subdivided into the subset of single - particle fields @xmath459 , @xmath460 and exchange fields @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath127 such that both sets become coupled through the specific nature of the rst dynamics .",
    "now that the exchange fields have been determined by hand in order to clearly display their topological features , one can face the problem of determining the dynamically associated single - particle fields @xmath461 , @xmath462 by solving the single - particle dynamics on the background of the given exchange fields .",
    "however , since the rst field equations constitute a very complicated dynamical system , one can not hope to attain here an exact solution where the single - particle fields would be of a comparably simple form as the present exchange fields ( [ e6:12 ] ) or ( [ e6:14 ] ) .",
    "rather , we will be satisfied with convincing ourselves of the consistency of the rst dynamics so that one can be sure that the desired single - particle solution , to be associated to our construction of the exchange field system , does exist in principle .",
    "first , consider the dynamical equations for the kinetic fields @xmath143 which must consist of a source equation and of a curl equation in order to fix these vector fields , apart from certain boundary conditions .",
    "the source equations consist of both equations ( [ e3:36]a ) , where however the coupling conditions ( [ e6:15])-([e6:16 ] ) are to be taken into account :      furthermore , the curl equations for the kinetic fields have already been specified by equations ( [ e3:35a ] ) where the gauge fields @xmath187 emerging there couple back to the rst currents @xmath67 ( [ e3:28 ] ) via the maxwell equations ( [ e2:16 ] ) , i.e. for the present two - particle situation @xmath464 observe here that the rst currents @xmath67 themselves are to be constructed by means of the single - particle and exchange fields according to @xmath465    evidently even if the exchange fields @xmath285 , @xmath22 , @xmath142 are known ( e.g. by our procedure of stereographic projection ( [ e6:12])-([e6:14 ] ) ) , the kinetic fields still couple through their sources ( [ e6:17 ] ) to the unknown amplitude fields @xmath466 .",
    "therefore the single - particle dynamics must be closed by specifying the field equations for the amplitudes @xmath466 which are of course given by the wave equations ( [ e3:32 ] ) where the known exchange fields have to be inserted : @xmath467 the right - hand side may be interpreted as the effect of an `` exchange potential '' @xmath468 @xmath469 where however both potentials are identical ( @xmath470 ) because of the general quadratic exchange coupling ( [ e3:40 ] ) .",
    "there is no doubt that the present single - particle dynamics will admit non - trivial solutions which are however too difficult to be constructed analytically ( for constructing _ approximate _ static solutions see ref .",
