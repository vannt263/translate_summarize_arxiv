    "various tracks through the color - magnitude distribution have been proposed , most of which consider that blue galaxies are the building blocks for most red - sequence galaxies , with evolution _ along _ the red sequence also necessary to produce the most massive galaxies , which have insufficient blue counterparts of similar mass .",

    "* ( conroy & van dokkum , 2012 ) ) .",
    "this allows the full information content of the spectrum to be used , and avoids changing the observed data to accommodate the specific model framework by instead adapting the models to the data .",
    "a number of approaches have been employed to use such models and spectral fitting to derive the star formation histories of galaxies , typically either selecting a fixed functional form ( such as an exponential ) , and solving for the function s free parameters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( e.g. pforr et al . 2012 ) ) ; or selecting the best fitting scenario from a large library of different trial histories , which can take arbitrary forms ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ( ocvirk et al . , 2006 ) ) .",
    "as well as being instructive from a galaxy evolution perspective , knowing the distribution of population parameters within a galaxy can have a large impact in how we interpret the stellar light in terms of mass , via the stellar mass to light ratio .",
    "for example , a galaxy may have absorption line strengths that are fully consistent with a single stellar population ( ssp ) age of 3  gyr .",
    "the same combination of indices may be equally well fitted by combination of two different ssps , say 95% by mass of 13gyr and 5% of 1gyr .",
    "these two scenarios would differ in inferred mass by almost a factor of 3 .",
    "this effect was shown in @xcite where the population and dynamical m / l properties of 24 early - type galaxies , all with high - quality integral - field spectroscopy from the survey , were compared .",
    "younger galaxies deviated systematically from the identity line towards lower population - based m / l . by modeling these younger galaxies using two population components , one older ( 12  gyr , 90% by mass ) , and one younger , the dynamical- and population - based m / l values came into agreement .",
    "an analogous study was recently made by ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* cappellari et al.(2012a , 2012b ) ) using the atlas@xmath0 survey of 260 early - type galaxies , again modeling the stellar dynamics and populations derived from integral - field spectroscopy covering to around one effective radius for each galaxy .",
    "star - formation histories were derived for each galaxy using the regularized spectral fitting method of @xcite , fitting for the age and metallicity distribution in each object . from these distributions of mass contributions in each age and metallicity bin , it is possible to compute the mass in stars , as well as the light output , giving effectively the mass - weighted m / l .    for the dynamical m / l estimates , it is first necessary to describe the stellar light distribution .",
    "it is important to do this as accurately as possible , as it will determine the assumed stellar mass distribution , which will in turn affect the spatially resolved kinematics predicted for a given m / l .",
    "early - type galaxies show a wealth of detailed structure in their spatially resolved surface brightness distributions , even though they are often assumed to follow computationally convenient , spherically - symmetric profiles . instead",
    ", the 260 sdss r - band galaxy images were fitted in detail using the multi - gaussian expansion ( mge ) approach ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( monet et al . , 1992 ; emsellem et al . , 1994 ) ) .",
    "even imposing the constraint of axisymmetry , the light distribution is fitted to high precision , matching substructures such as disks , boxiness , and variations in radial profile shapes that are missed in simpler models .",
    "the dynamical m / l estimates were computed using the jeans anisotropic mge ( jam ) approach of @xcite , which extends the semi - isotropic ( @xmath7 , two integral ) formalism of @xcite to the case where the velocity ellipsoid is aligned with the cylindrical coordinates @xmath8 , and the anisotropy is parameterised as @xmath9 .",
    "the free parameters are the m / l , @xmath10 , and the inclination of the system , @xmath11 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the jeans equations are solved to produce an estimate of the projected second velocity moment @xmath12 as a function of position , which is compared to the observed kinematics , and the best - fit case found .",
    "the resulting fits to the high - quality kinematic data tightly constrain the m / l .",
    "in addition to the effects of young stellar populations on the inferred m / l , @xcite also showed that , adopting a universal form of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , it is not possible to have the m / l from populations and dynamics agree for all galaxies . specifically , there was a weak trend that higher - mass galaxies showed increasing dynamical m / l with no corresponding increase in population m / l - i.e. the stellar kinematics showed a mass component in these galaxies that is unaccounted for in the light . two possibilities",
    "are : ( 1 ) that the dark matter fraction is different in the central parts of these galaxies ; or ( 2 ) the initial mass function of the stellar populations is different . however , the effects of these two possibilities are degenerate for the data and modeling employed .",
    "interestingly , this same finding was later confirmed using different data and an independent approach , via gravitational lensing ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( treu et al . , 2010 ) ) .    with atlas@xmath0",
    ", the sample size increases ten - fold over the study , with comparable 2d kinematic and imaging data .",
    "the jam modeling approach is computationally much more efficient compared with more general methods , and is readily applied to large samples .",
    "integral field data are also essential here , as the inclination and anisotropy vary the _ shape _ of the @xmath13 distribution away from the principle axes , which would not be seen with major- or minor - axis long slit data .    the fit to the stellar light and 2d @xmath13 is sufficiently constraining that , for the first time , it is possible to break the degeneracy between the stellar mass distribution and the dark matter component , thus allowing trends in these properties to be tracked across the galaxy sample .",
    "this was done by assuming several different models for the distribution of the dark matter , each motivated by current theoretical models .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the results .",
    "if the estimates from both methods were consistent , the points would all lie horizontally . since the dark matter variations are accounted for , this variation must come from the initial mass function of the stellar population ( which is held fixed in this diagram ) .",
    "this finding supports recent claims ( van dokkum & conroy , 2010 , conroy & van dokkum 2012 ) that show spectral evidence for large numbers of faint , low - mass dwarf stars in the centers of early - type galaxies .",
    "this claim has been generally supported by numerous other similar studies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( e.g. spiniello et al . , 2012 ; ferreras et al . , 2012 ; smith et al . , 2012b ) ) .",
    "we note that these spectral studies are required to distinguish the slope of the imf , as gravitational studies alone can not distinguish between dark mass from faint low - mass stars , or remnants from massive star evolution .",
    "the variations of stellar populations _ within _ massive galaxies indicate the diversity of processes in their evolution , and are consistent with a number of possible formation scenarios .",
    "once again , the power of integral - field spectroscopy gives a unique view of these properties , allowing spatial structures in the populations to be unambiguously associated to other features , such as kinematic components , dust lanes , gas disks , etc . in this way",
    ", @xcite showed that the presence of young stars is often accompanied by the presence of a rapidly - rotating disk component in the kinematics . in some cases",
    ", these components also show disks of molecular gas that are co - spatial with the young stellar disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( young et al . , 2008 ) ) , showing that gas has settled onto the equatorial plane of the system and is forming new stars .",
    "metallicity gradients are essentially ubiquitous in early - type galaxies of all masses , and occur in the sense that metallicity decreases in the outskirts , falling approximately as a power law with radius .",
    "a more physical interpretation of these gradients comes from considering that the metallicity is tracing a change in the gravitational potential , which can be characterized by the escape velocity .",
    "a recent study by @xcite has shown that early - type galaxies collectively follow trends in there local stellar population ",
    "escape velocity relations .",
    "this is suggestive that the formation of metals does not care about the specific galaxy as much as what the local potential is . in a situation where stellar winds control the star - formation process",
    ", deeper potentials could retain more enriched gas , leading to a strong connection between the metallicity and the local potential .",
    "dry galaxy merging would disrupt this connection , and so the tightness of the local - global trends limits the number of major dry mergers to approximately 1.5 over a hubble time ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( scott et al . 2009 ) ) .",
    "a somewhat different scenario for building metallicity gradients in was proposed by @xcite , based on simulations . here",
    "the central regions of the most massive galaxies form very early on , through rapid gas inflow and subsequent collapse , quickly forming a moderately massive , compact object .",
    "these then proceeded to accrete lower mass galaxies .",
    "the merging process is such that most of the stars of an accreted satellite infall only as far as where the satellite s binding energy equates that of the parent potential .",
    "thus stars from lower - mass galaxies ( which in turn have lower metallicity due to the effect of stellar winds ) remain at larger radii , naturally creating a metallicity gradient .",
    "studies of metallicity profiles at very large radii are difficult , as the galaxy surface brightness becomes very low - orders of magnitude below the sky level .",
    "nevertheless , innovative observations , such as deep long - slit integrations ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ( arnold et al . , 2011 ) ) , can measure line - strengths out to 3 - 4 effective radii ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "in general , changes from the central gradient are subtle , and current small samples preclude general conclusions .",
    "colour profiles offer a promising technique to study these extremely faint outer regions .",
    "deep imaging of massive galaxies often reveals direct signs of interactions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( duc et al . , 2011 ) ) .",
    "stacking carefully selected shallower data can also probe depths out to 8 effective radii ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( la barbera et al . , 2012 ) ) - much further out than is possible with current spectroscopic instruments .",
    "in addition to the difficulties of accurate sky subtraction and flat fielding at these very low surface brightnesses , the effects of chromatic psf differences is very important , as the faint halo of the psf spreads low - level light across large scales , and varies with each filter .",
    "secondly , the stellar population models suffer degeneracy between age and metallicity in broad - band photometry , and generally lack sensitivity to subtle metallicity changes .",
    "however , the extensive baseline in radius , and rich spatial information make deep imaging an important complement to spectroscopy .",
    "much has been written on the role of environment in influencing galaxy evolution , and , in particular , the star - formation process within galaxies .",
    "rich clusters are the largest over - densities of baryonic matter in the universe , and in a hierarchical framework , assembled mass more quickly than their surroundings . but does the act of being in a cluster impose intrinsic stellar population differences on member galaxies compared to the field ?    the influential study of @xcite found a difference in the mean ages of massive galaxies in high - density and low - density regions independent of galaxy velocity dispersion . in a more recent study , using similar methods for a much larger sample of galaxies but with lower quality data , @xcite revised this picture to one where the more massive population has stellar ages that are independent of environment .",
    "instead , the difference is attributed to the significance of the low mass ` rejuvenated ' population , which are more common in low - density environments .        a recent study by @xcite addressed the question of environment using sdss spectroscopy of the coma cluster .",
    "this study found that , at high masses , the galaxy ssp - equivalent ages are only weakly sensitive to their position in the cluster , in the sense that all the most massive objects are old regardless of their position in the cluster .",
    "by contrast , the age of low - mass galaxies vary strongly with radius from the cluster centre .",
    "the combined effect is a reduction in the mean stellar age of galaxies with increasing distance from the cluster centre , which is mostly driven by the dependence of the lower - mass objects to the cluster - centric radius .",
    "we show in figure 4 that this picture is similar in essence to that of the apparent ` separability ' of mass and environment with respect to the quenching of star formation , proposed by @xcite . whereas the specific mechanism for ` mass quenching ' is rather unclear ,",
    "the fact that environment has an effect preferentially on lower mass systems is expected , given the clear signs of interactions and stripping that characterize the experience of a gas - rich galaxy falling into a larger parent or cluster halo ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( e.g. vollmer et al . , 2010 ) ) .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , the radial age dependence in coma , driven by lower mass galaxies , can be understood when one considers that clusters are not well mixed and relaxed dynamical systems in the hierarchical paradigm .",
    "indeed , for fixed halo mass , simulations show that the present - day position within the cluster is closely related ( on average ) to the infall epoch in the past ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( e.g. smith et al . , 2012a ; de lucia et al . , 2012",
    "; mcgee et al . , 2012 ) ) .",
    "thus environmental quenching associated to a galaxy transitioning from a ` central ' to a ` satellite ' object naturally imposes a temporal and spatial signature on the stellar population properties of cluster galaxies .",
    "mass assembly is closely connected to this process via accretion and merging , and @xcite therefore argue that the ` history bias ' inherent in the observational snapshot we see at any epoch may render the question of mass versus environment ill - posed .",
    "the main conclusions i wished to convey with this contribution are    * the ` massive ' galaxy population has a significant contribution from late - type spiral galaxies at all but the very highest masses . * compelling circumstantial evidence connects agn activity with the transition of galaxies from the star - forming blue cloud to the passive red sequence .",
    "however , detailed studies of objects ` caught in the act ' of reducing their star - formation are needed to progress from correlation to causation . * cold gas , young stars , and ongoing low - level star formation are frequently observed in early - type galaxies , and must be considered as part of their formation / evolution * the imf varies systematically between low- and high - mass early - type galaxies . *",
    "spatially - resolved observations are a unique way to accurately connect observational features across widely different datasets .",
    "spatial distributions and kinematic orientations also offer unique constraints on the origins of galaxy components . *",
    "the outer envelopes of galaxies are new frontiers for testing galaxy formation models * environment plays a key role in our picture of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "insights from galaxy formation models help us to see these trends as part of a complete formation path , which may not easily be inferred from instantaneous view we have .",

    "<S> i present a brief review of the stellar population properties of massive galaxies , focusing on early - type galaxies in particular , with emphasis on recent results from the atlas@xmath0 survey . </S>",
    "<S> i discuss the occurrence of young stellar ages , cold gas , and ongoing star formation in early - type galaxies , the presence of which gives important clues to the evolutionary path of these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> consideration of empirical star formation histories gives a meaningful picture of galaxy stellar population properties , and allows accurate comparison of mass estimates from populations and dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this has recently provided strong evidence of a non - universal imf , as supported by other recent evidences . </S>",
    "<S> spatially - resolved studies of stellar populations are also crucial to connect distinct components within galaxies to spatial structures seen in other wavelengths or parameters . </S>",
    "<S> stellar populations in the faint outer envelopes of early - type galaxies are a formidable frontier for observers , but promise to put constraints on the ratio of accreted stellar mass versus that formed ` in situ ' - a key feature of recent galaxy formation models . </S>",
    "<S> galaxy environment appears to play a key role in controlling the stellar population properties of low mass galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> simulations remind us , however , that current day galaxies are the product of a complex assembly and environment history , which gives rise to the trends we see . </S>",
    "<S> this has strong implications for our interpretation of environmental trends . </S>"
