    "compounds with a negative linear ( or surface ) compressibility have recently attracted an interest@xcite because of their specific properties ( stretch - induced densification and auxetic behavior ) , which might have promising applications . in the case of pure materials",
    "only `` rare '' crystal phases exhibit these effects , while for composite structures@xcite it seems to be rather common .",
    "recent experimental studies on insertion into organic@xcite and non - organic@xcite matrices reveal the negative compressibility effects due to the host - guest coupling . conceptually similar",
    "escape transition@xcite occurs when a polymer chain is compressed between two pistons .",
    "charge separation in confined fluids has also been accompanied@xcite with the negative compressibility .",
    "these examples suggest that the insertion systems with confinement and swelling ( dilatation ) should exhibit this generic effect at appropriate conditions .",
    "in particular , two - particle systems confined to two - dimensional finite - size boxes of different geometry have been studied@xcite in this context .",
    "it has been found that the isotherms exhibit a van der waals - type ( vdw ) instability ( loop ) as the box size passes through a critical value .",
    "the instability has been associated with a prototype of a liquid - gas or a liquid - solid transition in many - body systems .",
    "a quite similar instability appears in two - dimensional granular media@xcite , whose effective temperature decreases with the density , leading to a phase separation .",
    "similar features have been detected@xcite in hard discs confined to a narrow channel .",
    "nevertheless , the non - monotonic behavior has been attributed to a sharp change in the accessible phase space , without any connection to collective effects typical for the conventional phase transitions .",
    "it is well - known , however , that a liquid - gas transition in finite systems@xcite manifests itself through the negative compressibility states due to the surface effects .",
    "thus , it is quite interesting to find out if such a loop could exist in three - dimensional many - body systems and what is the physics behind . in particular",
    ", we focus on a prototype of an insertion system .",
    "one of the key features of such systems is a host dilatation ( or contraction ) upon a guest accommodation .",
    "this is evident from experiments with high - porosity materials , like aerogels@xcite . upon adsorption",
    "such matrices change in volume and their pore size distribution depends on the adsorbate pressure ( or density ) .",
    "this effect is not exclusive to relatively soft gel - like matrices , it is quite common for carbon nanotubes@xcite and various intercalation compounds@xcite . in anisotropic cases ( e.g. layered compounds ) one deals with a competition of two effects .",
    "an increase of the lateral dimension ( stretching ) at constant number of particles tends to decrease the guest density .",
    "this usually induces a transversal shrink , leading to a densification in this direction .",
    "since we have a composite host - guest system , the shrink does not obey the linear elasticity rules and , depending on the shrink intensity , one might expect the negative compressibility .",
    "in particular , it has been shown@xcite that a nonlinear increase of the host size with the guest concentration may induce a liquid - gas coexistence for the guest fluid even if the bulk liquid phase does not exist ( e.g. a hard - sphere fluid ) .",
    "this means that the negative compressibility states were indeed present , but they were unstable under the conditions imposed .",
    "therefore , the objective of this paper is to find the conditions at which a coupling of the host dilatation and the guest confinement can stabilize the negative compressibility states . for this purpose",
    "we start with a quite simple model - the hard spheres , adsorbed in a softly - repulsing planar slit with a density - dependent width .",
    "the model contains all the relevant features : confinement , dilatation and spatial anisotropy .",
    "the latter is important because it offers a possibility of observing negative linear and positive tangential compressibilities , preserving the overall thermodynamic stability . on the other hand , in the absence of the dilatation ( fixed slit width )",
    ", the model is phenomenologically simple@xcite . in particular",
    ", there is no a liquid - vapor transition ( both in the bulk and in confined geometries ) .",
    "such that the new aspects are not masked by the internal complexity .",
    "the system is analyzed by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulation and a first - order perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "qualitative reliability of this approach has been tested in application to the liquid - vapor coexistence@xcite and phase separation@xcite in confined geometries .",
    "consider @xmath0 hard spheres of diameter @xmath1 in a planar slit with the surface area @xmath2 .",
    "the slit itself is a part of a hosting system , whose coupling to the guest species changes the slit geometry .",
    "therefore , the slit width @xmath3 is not fixed , it fluctuates according to the fluid density ( see below ) . for any @xmath3",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hard sphere hamiltonian , @xmath6 is the slit potential @xmath7 ; \\qquad 1/2 \\le z_i \\le h-1/2.\\ ] ] we do not take into account a short - ranged fluid - wall attraction , responsible for the surface adsorption or layering effects .",
    "the inverse - power shape for @xmath6 is chosen as a generic form of a soft repulsion , with @xmath8 controlling the softness .",
    "for technical purposes we are working with @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , our results are qualitatively insensitive to a particular choice of @xmath8 .    it should be noted that we do not discuss an adsorption mechanism or the equilibrium between the pore and the bulk fluids . in our case",
    "@xmath0 is fixed and we focus on the pressure variation due to the changes in the slit geometry .",
    "in practice the evolution of the matrix morphology is much slower than the fluid equilibration process .",
    "then for a given width @xmath3 we can calculate the fluid thermodynamics conditional to @xmath3 .      at any pore width @xmath3",
    "the free energy can be represented as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the free energy of a reference system , and @xmath12 is the average over the reference state . taking a spatially confined hard sphere system ( the one with @xmath13 ) as a reference , we consider a first order perturbation@xcite for the conditional free energy @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the pore density in the `` slab '' approximation @xmath17 ignoring a non - monotonic behavior of the density profile with increasing pore density .",
    "this is reasonable for wide pores and low fluid densities .",
    "the reference part is estimated in the excluded volume approximation , while the perturbation contribution is @xmath18 , such that the total conditional free energy is @xmath19   } -n + n\\beta\\psi(h)\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the excluded volume factor , @xmath21 is the thermal de broglie length and @xmath22 tangential @xmath23 and normal @xmath24 pressures can be found as @xmath25 this leads to @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "equation ( [ rh ] ) allows us to eliminate the surface density @xmath28 in the favor of @xmath16 and we obtain the following equation of state @xmath29 therefore , for a fixed @xmath3 , our result is clear and simple .",
    "the tangential pressure has the bulk form , with the bulk density being replaced by the pore density . as a consequence of the first - order perturbative approach ,",
    "@xmath23 does not depend on the slit - fluid interaction . as we will see later ,",
    "the simulation results demonstrate that this dependence is indeed quite weak . if necessary",
    "this effect can be reproduced theoretically taking into account the second - order perturbation term .",
    "the normal pressure increases due to the repulsion @xmath30 and decreases with increasing pore width @xmath3 , such that @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",
    "recall that we are dealing with a fixed @xmath0 .",
    "the insertion process can be considered in the same framework .",
    "just instead of the pressure components one would calculate the system response to increasing @xmath0 the insertion isotherm @xmath33   } + \\frac{b\\rho(h)}{1-b\\rho(h ) } + \\beta\\psi(h)\\ ] ] which relates the fluid density and the chemical potential @xmath34 .      as is discussed above , the pore dilatation can be taken into account , assuming that the width @xmath3 is density - dependent .",
    "real insertion materials are usually rather complex ( multicomponent and heterogeneous ) . for that reason one usually deals with a distribution of pore sizes or with an average size . in this context",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is known only statistically and the probability distribution @xmath35 is conditional@xcite to the guest density @xmath36 , which should be selfconsistently found from @xmath37 then , taking our results for @xmath24 and @xmath23 , we can focus on the equation of state averaged over the width fluctuations .",
    "@xmath38    this , however , requires a knowledge on the distribution @xmath35 . even without resorting to a concrete form for @xmath35 ,",
    "it is clear that the matrix reaction can be manifested as a change in the distribution width or / and the mean value .",
    "one of the simplest forms reflecting at least one of these features is a @xmath39-like distribution , ignoring a non - zero width .",
    "@xmath40\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the dirac @xmath39-function and the mean pore width @xmath42 is density - dependent .",
    "\\rho_0])\\ ] ] this form mimics a non - vegard behavior , typical for layered intercalation compounds@xcite . at low densities ( @xmath44 )",
    "the dilatation is weak .",
    "the most intensive response is at @xmath45 , and then the pore reaches a saturation , corresponding to its mechanical stability limit . here",
    "@xmath46 is the matrix response constant or dilatation rate , controlling the slope near @xmath45 .    from eq .",
    "( [ rp ] ) the average density is found to be @xmath47 changing the surface density @xmath28 we vary the average pore density @xmath36 .",
    "this allows us to eliminate @xmath28 in the favor of @xmath36 in all thermodynamic functions .",
    "combining eqs  ( [ excluded ] ) and ( [ p ] ) we obtain @xmath48 it is convenient to introduce the compressibility function @xmath49 which vanishes in a non - swelling limit ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that @xmath51 could be singular either if the swelling is discontinuous , or if @xmath52 exhibits an inflection point . in what follows we focus on the second option .    in the case of a wide and weakly reacting",
    "pore we expand in terms of @xmath53 and @xmath46 , obtaining a generic van der waals form @xmath54 therefore , we have an interplay of several effects  the packing ( first term ) , the fluid - matrix interaction ( linear in density ) , and the matrix reaction ( quadratic term ) .",
    "it is seen that a coupling of the fluid - slit repulsion ( @xmath55 ) , spatial confinement ( @xmath56 ) and the matrix response ( @xmath46 ) acts as an effective infinite - range fluid - fluid attraction ( but just in one direction ) . introducing a dimensionless temperature @xmath57 , and solving @xmath58",
    "we find the `` critical '' parameters @xmath59 at which the normal compressibility @xmath51 diverges .",
    "it is seen that a physically meaningful ( with @xmath60 ) pseudo - criticality appears only at @xmath61 . in other words , the matrix reaction @xmath46 should dominate the packing effects .",
    "in addition , @xmath62 decreases with increasing pore width @xmath56 .",
    "it is well known that for bulk systems the vdw loop appearing at @xmath63 is unphysical and one usually invokes the maxwell construction , determining the liquid - vapor coexistence . as we will see below , in our case",
    "the loop is a physically justified effect .",
    "it appears as a competition between the packing , which tends to increase the pressure with increasing @xmath36 and the slit dilatation , decreasing @xmath52 with increasing @xmath36 . as a result",
    "the states with negative linear compressibility are stabilized .",
    "note that this behavior is not sensitive to the particular form ( [ hr ] ) of @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , the dilatation rate @xmath46 is essential , while the dilatation magnitude @xmath64 plays only a marginal role .",
    "as it should be , this effect disappears in the bulk limit @xmath65 or in the case of insensitive matrices @xmath66 .    in order to be more accurate in comparison to the mc data",
    "the reference part is replaced by the carnahan - starling form @xmath67 ^ 3}+ 16 a^ * \\rho\\frac{(2h(\\rho)+1)(h(\\rho)-1)}{(2h(\\rho)-1)^3 } ; \\qquad \\eta=\\pi \\rho/6.\\ ] ] this allows us to avoid the unphysical behavior at high densities .",
    "in order to verify the existence of the loop predicted by the perturbation theory as well as to get more insight into the phenomenon the mc simulation of the model has been carried out .",
    "we applied the canonical nvt mc simulations of a confined hard sphere fluid to calculate the density profiles and pressure components .",
    "the simulation cell was parallelepiped in shape , with parallel walls at surface separation @xmath3 , and surface area @xmath68 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions were applied to the @xmath69 and @xmath70 directions of the simulation box ; the box length in the @xmath71 direction is fixed by the pore width . for a given pore width",
    "the adsorbed fluid density is chosen according to the eq.([rh ] ) .",
    "there was constant number of particles , @xmath72 , and a desired fluid density has been get by adjusting the value of area , @xmath2 .",
    "we repeated our simulation runs with bigger number of particles , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , but no significant differences were found .",
    "the density profiles , @xmath75 , were calculated in the usual way by counting the number of particles , @xmath76 in the slabs of thickness @xmath77 parallel to the plane @xmath78 by using @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the slab volume @xmath81 .",
    "the definition of irving and kirkwood @xcite has been used to calculate the components of the pressure .",
    "the normal component of the pressure for the fluid - fluid interaction is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the total density profile and @xmath84 denotes the average over the mc configurations .",
    "the tangential component , @xmath85 , has been calculated by substitution of @xmath86 by @xmath87 in equation ( [ pn ] ) . for hard spheres",
    "the derivative of the potential is @xmath88    the dirac @xmath39 function in our simulation was approximated as @xmath89 as @xmath90 . in eq .",
    "( [ lam ] ) @xmath91 is used to define the region where two particles collides .",
    "a collision between particles occurs if @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , for the particular case of hard spheres the averaged normal component of the pressure tensor for fluid - fluid interactions can be reduced to @xmath93 the wall - fluid interaction is a function of @xmath94 and affects only @xmath52 while the tangential component remains the same .",
    "the normal pressure in this case is @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the fluid - wall contributions from surfaces located at @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "these contributions are defined as @xmath100 @xmath101    these definitions of the pressure tensor treat the wall - particle interaction as a contribution to the intermolecular forces in a system consisting of the fluid and solid , rather than as an external field acting on the fluid .",
    "thus the normal component of the pressure tensor must be independent of @xmath94 as a condition of mechanical equilibrium and for a system containing bulk fluid must be equal to the pressure at the bulk density .",
    "tangential components should approach the bulk pressure for sufficiently large @xmath3 .    in this work we have taken parameter @xmath102 equal to @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 to make the extrapolation .",
    "the average normal component , includes the fluid - fluid and fluid - wall contributions given by equations ( [ pnav ] ) and ( [ pnw1 ] ) .",
    "each simulation runs @xmath106 mc cycles , with the first half for the system to reach equilibrium whereas the second half for evaluating the ensemble averages .",
    "in agreement with our theoretical prediction , the simulation results confirm that the negative compressibility states ( the loop ) appear only if the slit reaction @xmath46 reaches some threshold value @xmath107 which involves a combination of @xmath56 , @xmath108 and @xmath55 .",
    "the variation of the average density @xmath36 due to the dilatation should dominate its variation , induced by the changes in the surface density @xmath28",
    ".    pressure as a function of the average pore density is plotted in figure  1 .",
    "it is seen that the normal component @xmath52 develops the loop with increasing pore - fluid repulsion @xmath55 .",
    "the simulation results confirm that this feature is not an artefact of our theoretical approximations . as expected@xcite ,",
    "the perturbation theory systematically underestimates the magnitude of the fluid - wall repulsion , @xmath55 , ( overestimates the temperature @xmath109 ) at which this effect takes place .",
    "the tangential component @xmath110 is much less sensitive to the slit dilatation .",
    "this is coherent with our theoretical estimation . interestingly , that @xmath110 can be reasonably fitted by the expression for @xmath52 taken at much lower @xmath55 ( see the insets ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that at sufficiently strong repulsion ( low temperatures ) @xmath110 could also be non - monotonic .",
    "this would correspond to a fluid - solid transformation , which is not considered here .",
    "the loop becomes more pronounced with increasing dilatation rate @xmath46 .",
    "since only one pressure component exhibits this behavior , there is no rational basis to suspect a vdw instability ( of liquid - vapor type ) .",
    "moreover , we are dealing with rather wide pores ( @xmath111 ) in order to avoid the narrow channel effects@xcite .",
    "this makes us to search for an alternative explanation .    with this purpose",
    "we have analyzed the fluid structure at different densities .",
    "the density profiles are presented in figure  2 .",
    "it is obvious that the system does not exhibit strong density oscillations .",
    "it is worth noting , that our perturbation theory results are obtained in the slab approximation , eq.([rh ] ) , which does not take them into account . on the other hand ,",
    "analysis of the density profiles indicates a sudden change of the packing regime in the negative compressibility region ( in between the points @xmath55 and @xmath112 , marked in the figure  1  ( b ) ) .",
    "the fluid film becomes more dilute with decreasing ( e. g. due to a lateral stretching ) density up to the point @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "this process goes uniformly in the middle of the film and at the periphery . passing from @xmath113 to @xmath114 does not change the middle density , while the rarefaction takes place only near the slit walls . upon reaching @xmath115",
    "the film suddenly densifies in the middle .",
    "this corresponds to the inflection point in figure  1  ( b ) .",
    "up to the point @xmath55 with @xmath116 the film dilutes only at its periphery .",
    "then we return to the usual uniform dilution with further decrease in the density",
    ". therefore , there is a clear correlation between the negative compressibility states and the packing mechanism .    in order to study the redistribution of the fluid density",
    "we have calculated the average density @xmath117 in slabs of different thickness @xmath94 @xmath118 the obtained results are presented in figure  3 .",
    "as seen , @xmath117 exhibits the same loop as the normal pressure does .",
    "going towards the middle of the pore makes this effect more pronounced .",
    "such similarity permits us to conclude that the fluid - wall soft repulsion ( coupled to the dilatation @xmath46 ) is a main reason of the fluid reordering inside the pore , and as a consequence the states with negative compressibility can occur .",
    "this is clearly seen from eq .",
    "( [ cs ] ) , that gives a monotonic isotherm as @xmath119 or @xmath66 .",
    "it is interesting to mention that a similar trend has been described recently in the studies of mineral clays swelling @xcite .",
    "namely , smith et al .",
    "@xcite reported the simulation results of hydrated na - smectites with variable layer charge .",
    "they found that the tendency to swell increases with increasing layer charge ( increasing repulsion ) , which is consistent with our conclusions .",
    "we have found that a coupling of the fluid - slit repulsion , spatial confinement and the slit dilatation acts as an anisotropic fluid - fluid attraction , inducing negative linear compressibility states .",
    "these states are shown to be related to an abrupt change in the packing regime , including a local densification in the middle with decreasing surface density .",
    "this resembles the stretch - densification effects@xcite in negative compressibility materials . in the context of our model",
    "the mechanism is the following . stretching in the lateral direction decreases the surface @xmath28 and the pore @xmath36 densities .",
    "this leads to a transversal shrink @xmath42 at the rate @xmath46 .",
    "this stabilizes the negative transversal compressibility when the rate passes some threshould value .",
    "this mechanism is quite different from that explored in the low - dimensional systems@xcite , where the loops appeared essentially due to the small - size effects restricting the phase space accessibility when the box length became comparable with the particle size . as a result , the vdw feature is found@xcite to be very sensitive to the box geometry ( rectangular or spherical ) . in our case",
    "we deal with a three - dimensional system where the particles can exchange their positions almost freely ( @xmath120 ) , although the phase space is somewhat restricted by the slit - fluid repulsion .",
    "nevertheless , our model shares some of the low - dimensional features@xcite and we recover the usual monotonic behavior in the bulk limit @xmath65 .",
    "since the tangential pressure component does not exhibit this effect , the system does not undergo a phase transition ( at least in its traditional sense ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the absence of strong density fluctuations ( in both directions ) . on the other hand",
    ", the loop appears in the direction , along which our system is finite ( finite @xmath3 ) and , therefore , the negative compressibility can be considered as a finite - size effect@xcite , vanishing in the bulk limit .",
    "nevertheless , an inclusion of an attractive fluid - fluid interaction would result@xcite in the pore condensation . in this respect",
    "it would be quite interesting to analyze how the above stretch - densification coexists with the true critical behavior .",
    "the role of more isotropic geometries ( e.g. spherical pores ) as well as that of a non - zero distribution width ( @xmath35 ) and the potential softness @xmath8 could also be discussed .",
    "another interesting point is to describe the sorption behavior , that is , changing @xmath36 by varying @xmath0 at fixed @xmath2 . in this way we can mimic a `` dosen '' adsorption@xcite or the equilibrium with an infinite bulk reservoir .",
    "we plan to analyze these issues in a future work .",
