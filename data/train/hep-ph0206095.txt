    "the results obtained in the last few years by the na48  @xcite and the ktev  @xcite collaborations have marked a great experimental achievement , establishing some 35 years after the discovery of cp violation in the neutral kaon system  @xcite the existence of a much smaller violation acting directly in the decays : [ eoenew ] ( / ) = \\ {    ll ( 15.3 2.6)10 ^ -4 & ( na48 ) + ( 20.7 2.8)10 ^ -4 & ( ktev ) .    .",
    "the average of these results with the previous measurements by the na31 collaboration at cern and by the e731 experiment at fermilab gives [ eoewa ] ( / ) = ( 17.2 1.8)10 ^ -4 .",
    "while the standard model ( sm ) of strong and electroweak interactions provides an economical and elegant understanding of indirect  ( @xmath1 ) and direct  ( @xmath2 ) cp violation in term of a single phase , the detailed calculation of the size of these effects implies mastering strong interactions at a scale where perturbative methods break down .",
    "in addition , direct cp violation in @xmath3 decays arises from a detailed balance of two competing sets of contributions , which may hopelessly inflate the uncertainties related to the relevant hadronic matrix elements in the final outcome .",
    "all that makes predicting a complex and challenging task  @xcite .    just from the onset of the calculation",
    "the presence in the definition of , written as = \\ { - }  , [ eoedef ] of given ratios of isospin amplitudes warns us of a longstanding and still unsolved theoretical `` problem '' : the explanation of the @xmath0 selection rule .",
    "the @xmath0 selection rule in @xmath3 decays is known since 45 years  @xcite and it states the experimental evidence that kaons are 400 times more likely to decay in the @xmath4 two - pion state than in the @xmath5 component ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this rule is not justified by any symmetry argument and , although it is common understanding that its explanation must be rooted in the dynamics of strong interactions , there is up to date no derivation of this effect from first principle qcd .",
    "given the possibility that common systematic uncertainties may a - priori affect the calculation of and the @xmath0 rule ( see for instance the present difficulties in calculating on the lattice the `` penguin contractions '' for cp violating as well as for cp conserving amplitudes  @xcite ) a convincing calculation of must involve at the same time a reliable explanation of the @xmath0 selection rule . both observables indicate the need of large corrections to factorization in the evaluation of the four - quark hadronic transitions . among these corrections",
    "final state interactions ( fsi ) play a substantial role .",
    "however , fsi alone are _ not _ enough to account for the large ratio of the @xmath4 over @xmath5 amplitudes .",
    "other sources of large non - factorizable corrections are therefore needed for the cp conserving amplitudes  @xcite , which might affect the determination of as well . as a consequence , a self - contained calculation of",
    "should also address the determination of the @xmath3 rates .",
    "the operator product expansion ( ope ) provides us with a very effective way to address the calculation of hadronic transitions in gauge theories .",
    "the integration of the `` heavy '' gauge and matter fields allows us to write the relevant amplitudes in terms of the hadronic matrix elements of effective quark operators and of the corresponding wilson coefficients ( at a scale @xmath7 ) , which encode the information about those dynamical degrees of freedom which are heavier than the chosen renormalization scale . according to the sm flavor structure the @xmath8 transitions are effectively described by _",

    "only the latter `` feel '' all three quark families via the virtual quark exchange and are therefore sensitive to the weak cp phase .",
    "current - current operators control instead the cp conserving transitions .",

    "is this just `` noise '' in the theoretical calculations ? without entering the many details on which the estimates are based , most of the aforementioned difference can be explained in terms of a single effect : the different size of the hadronic matrix element of the gluonic penguin @xmath48 as obtained in the various approaches . in turn , this can be understood in terms of sizeable higher order chiral contributions ( nlo in the @xmath53 expansion ) to the @xmath4 amplitudes .",
    "this effect was stigmatized well before the latest experimental round by the work of the trieste group  @xcite , and appears clearly in the comparison of the leading @xmath53 and lattice results with the chiral quark model analysis in fig .",
    "[ fig : pre ] . the chiral quark model approach , together with the fit of the cp conserving amplitudes which normalizes phenomenologically the matching and the model parameters , allows us to carry the calculation of the hadronic matrix elements beyond the leading order in the chiral expansion ( including the needed local counterterms ) .",
