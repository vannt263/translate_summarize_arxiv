    "note that @xmath1 is not necessarily connected , so eigenvalue @xmath7 might not be simple .",
    "that is the reason why we start our numeration with @xmath8 as opposed to @xmath9 .",

    ", there is a unique harmonic extension @xmath12 , i.e. there is a unique @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "then one defines @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is an outward unit normal vector to @xmath1 .",
    "similarly to the laplacian the operator @xmath10 is elliptic self - adjoint with discrete spectrum .",
    "we denote the corresponding sequence of eigenvalues by @xmath18 where eigenvalues are counted with multiplicities .",
    "note again that the numeration starts with @xmath19 as opposed to @xmath20 .",
    "the numbers @xmath21 and the sequence @xmath22 are sometimes refered to as steklov eigenvalues of @xmath23 and steklov spectrum of @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the study of steklov spectrum has become rather popular in the recent years , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that under certain curvature restrictions on @xmath23 and @xmath1 the sequence @xmath22 is majorated by the sequence @xmath24 .",
    "the precise statement is the following .",
    "[ maintheorem ] let @xmath0 be a riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath25 with boundary .",
    "suppose that the weitzenbck curvature on @xmath26-forms @xmath27}$ ] is nonnegative and the lowest @xmath28-curvature @xmath29 of @xmath1 is bounded from below by a positive constant @xmath30 .",

    "hence , for @xmath48 inequality  ( [ maininequality ] ) is strict .    for a fixed manifold @xmath23 bound of the type  ( [ maininequality ] ) , i.e. inequality bounding @xmath49 in terms of a linear function of @xmath50 ,",

    "a curious feature of the proof is that it uses the extension of the steklov operator to the differential forms of higher degree defined by raulot and savo  @xcite , whereas the final statement does not refer to differential forms .    in case @xmath23",
    "is a surface we have the following theorem .    [ th2 ] let @xmath0 be a connected oriented riemannian surface .",

    "assume that @xmath142 is strictly greater than @xmath143 .",
    "we will show that in that case @xmath23 is not a maximum .",

    "hence , for each @xmath102 the sequence @xmath123 has exactly @xmath154 entries less than @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , the sequence @xmath120 contains @xmath156 entries less than @xmath143 .",

    "note that the above proposition is purely algebraic .",
    "nevertheless , as a corollary we obtain theorem  [ th2 ] .",
    "the proof is obtained by an easy combination of theorem  [ thyy ] and theorem  [ thrs ] .",
    "first of all , let us make a couple of observations .",

    "taking into account @xmath171 , the application of theorem  [ thyy ] for @xmath172 yields the inequality @xmath173 combining this inequality with inequlities from observation 2 , one completes the proof of theorem  [ maintheorem ] for orientable manifolds .",
    "it is possible to generalize theorem  [ thyy ] to include the case of non - orientable manifolds in a way that allows us to apply the arguments of the previous section .",
    "below we give the statement and the short outline of the argument .",
    "let us pass to an orientable double cover @xmath174 and endow it with the metric @xmath175 such that the involution @xmath176 exchanging the leaves of @xmath177 is an isometry .",
    "then @xmath176 induces the decomposition of differential forms on @xmath178 into even and odd with respect to @xmath176 which is compatible with hodge - morrey decomposition ( for details on hodge - morrey decomposition see  @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the eigenvalues of dirichlet - to - neumann and laplace operators are divided into those corresponding to odd and even eigenforms respectively .",
    "if we denote by @xmath179 the @xmath102-th even eigenvalue of @xmath5 on @xmath180 and similarly by @xmath181 the @xmath182-th odd steklov eigenvalue on @xmath183 , then inequality  ( [ thyyeq ] ) for @xmath178 becomes @xmath184    in order to prove  ( [ nonorientable ] ) one follows the proof of theorem  [ thyy ] accounting for the presence of @xmath176 .",
    "the key points are the following :    * differential @xmath137 is compatible with the decomposition into odd and even forms ; * hodge star operator sends odd forms to even and vice versa ; * since the kernel of @xmath95 consists of neumann harmonic @xmath37-fields and even neumann harmonic fields on @xmath178 are the pullbacks of neumann harmonic fields on @xmath23 , then @xmath185 , @xmath186 .    to complete the proof of theorem  [ maintheorem ] one makes the following two observations .",
    "first , local curvature conditions on @xmath23 pass to @xmath178 , therefore betti numbers disappear from the inequality  ( [ nonorientable ] ) .",
    "second , there is an obvious inequality @xmath187 . since even eigenvalues of @xmath178 coincide with the eigenvalues of @xmath23 , the same arguments as in section  [ proof ] conclude the proof",
    "in this secton we compare results of theorem  [ maintheorem ] with the following statement .",
    "[ thwx ] let @xmath0 be an @xmath17-dimensional compact connected riemannian manifold with non - negative ricci curvature and boundary @xmath1 .",
    "assume that the principal curvatures of @xmath1 are bounded from below by a positive constant @xmath30 .",
    "then one has the inequality @xmath188    we start our comparison with the case @xmath34 , where conditions of our theorem coincide with conditions of theorem  [ thwx ] ( since @xmath189 } = * w^{[2 ] } * = ric$ ] ) . theorem  [ maintheorem ] yields for @xmath63 and @xmath34 @xmath190 while inequality  ( [ thwxeq ] ) for @xmath34 becomes @xmath191      let @xmath193 .",
    "then @xmath194 and @xmath23 is convex , i.e. it satisfies the conditions of the theorem .",
    "if @xmath195 the lower bound for principal curvatures is @xmath196 while the lower bound @xmath197 for gaussian curvature of @xmath1 is @xmath198 . using the classical bound @xmath199 ( see e.  g. p. 186 of  @xcite ) one sees that the bound given by theorem  [ maintheorem ] is better once @xmath200 , i.e. once the ellipsoid is oblong enough .    in case @xmath31",
    "our condition @xmath27}\\geqslant 0 $ ] implies condition @xmath201 of theorem  [ thwx ] . at the same time , the assumption `` principle curvatures are bounded from below by @xmath202 '' of theorem  [ thwx ] implies the the lowest @xmath28-curvature is bounded from below by @xmath203 .",
    "thus , while our condition on the interior curvature is stronger , the condition on the curvature of @xmath1 is weaker . now , suppose that @xmath31 and @xmath0 satisfies the conditions of both theorem  [ maintheorem ] and theorem  [ thwx ] , i.e. @xmath27}\\geqslant 0 $ ] and all principle curvatures of @xmath1 are bounded from below by @xmath202 , then the lowest @xmath28-curvature is bounded from below by @xmath203 .",

    "according to the results of xia  @xcite the latter happens only if @xmath23 is a euclidean ball of radius @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , our estimate yields a better bound for any convex bounded domain of the euclidean space other than a ball .",
