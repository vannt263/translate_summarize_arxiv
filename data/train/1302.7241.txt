    "the optical properties of direct band gap semiconductor quantum wells have been studied extensively over the past few decades , and semiconductor quantum well heterostructures are found in a number of commercial optoelectronic devices , including lasers and optical modulators .",
    "recently , the optoelectronic properties of ge / sige quantum well structures grown on silicon substrates have become the subject of growing research interest .",
    "the quantum - confined stark effect ( qcse ) was first reported in this system in 2005,@xcite where a multiple quantum well ( mqw ) structure was grown on an alloy _ virtual substrate _",
    ", within which strain relaxes via the insertion of misfit dislocations and where the virtual substrate composition was chosen to provide strain balance to the mqw layers so that no net strain accumulates in the mqw stack . in the following years",
    "the qcse has been reported using a variety of quantum well dimensions and virtual substrate compositions,@xcite and has been extended to configurations for modulator structures,@xcite as well as to investigations of the carrier dynamics@xcite and to photoluminescence studies.@xcite    in iii - v quantum well systems the @xmath2-valley electron lifetimes are relatively long ( @xmath51ps ) , and consequently the exciton lineshapes can be described by a gaussian profile.@xcite in ge / sige quantum wells however , @xmath2-valley electrons are able to scatter into the lower - lying indirect valleys , and this results in a reduction of the electron lifetimes .",
    "the scattering lifetime is significant , as it determines the strength of the indirect absorption as well as the amount of lifetime broadening of the excitonic peaks .",
    "two of the most important metrics of an optical modulator are the insertion loss and extinction ratio that can be achieved.@xcite the scattering lifetime becomes a fundamental limiting factor for the insertion loss of a ge / sige quantum well modulator because these broadening mechanisms introduce losses in the structure at the applied field which corresponds to the transmitting state of the modulator .",
    "this in turn affects the extinction ratio , since in the design of a practical device there is a trade - off to between the extinction ratio and the insertion loss that can be tolerated .",
    "typically , contrast in the absorption coefficient that has been achieved with ge / sige quantum wells has been at wavelengths around 1450nm;@xcite however , most telecommunications applications use wavelengths close to 1550 nm or 1310 nm . some progress has been made in getting absorption coefficient contrast at 1550nm,@xcite but this has required elevated temperatures to exploit the temperature - induced bandwidth narrowing .",
    "recently , operation at 1310 nm has been reported by exploiting compressive in - plane strain to induce a blue - shift of the direct band edge;@xcite however , it remains unclear what the impact of the strain is on the carrier dynamics , and hence on the indirect absorption and lifetime broadening of excitonic peaks . in this work , strain - balanced ge / si@xmath6ge@xmath7 multiple quantum",
    "well stacks were epitaxially grown on si@xmath0ge@xmath1 virtual substrates on ( 100 ) silicon wafers in order to investigate the absorption properties of ge quantum wells with large amounts of compressive in - plane strain .",
    "the measured absorption spectra are compared with simulated data for 7 , 8 , 9 and 14-nm - thick quantum well heterostructures to gain insight into the physics of the system .",
    "we find that there is considerable splitting of the @xmath8-valley conduction band edges , and scattering into four of the six strain - split @xmath8-valley states is energetically allowed .",
    "this results in a reduction of the @xmath2-valley lifetime compared with bulk unstrained ge ( and with ge quantum wells grown on sige virtual substrates with a smaller si fraction ) , and is manifest in the spectra as an increased lifetime broadening component of the excitonic peaks , as well as an increase in the indirect absorption .",
    "we study the excitonic broadening as a function of the applied electric field , allowing separation of the contributions due to lifetime broadening , which is attributed to phonon scattering , and to disorder broadening caused by fluctuations in the dimensions of the quantum wells throughout the structure .",
    "strain - balanced ge / si@xmath6ge@xmath7 multiple - quantum - well ( mqw ) heterostructures with ten wells and eleven barriers were grown at 450@xmath9c using reduced - pressure chemical vapour deposition ( rp - cvd ) on a relaxed si@xmath0ge@xmath1 virtual substrate , which was formed using a reverse linear grading technique.@xcite the bottom layer of the device was @xmath10-doped with boron at @xmath11@xmath12 , on which was grown a 100-nm - thick intrinsic sige spacer , the mqw layers , a second 100-nm - thick intrinsic spacer layer , an @xmath13-type sige layer doped with phosphorous at @xmath11@xmath12 , and finally a 2-nm - thick si cap layer .",
    "80-@xmath14m - diameter circular mesas were etched to form vertical @xmath10-@xmath15-@xmath13 diodes , and a ti / al metal stack was deposited and sintered at 400@xmath9c for 30  minutes to form electrical contacts .",
    "a 100-w xenon lamp was used as a light source , and a 3-nm - bandwidth monochromator was used to provide wavelength selectivity .",
    "the signal was optically - chopped and focussed onto an optical fibre to illuminate the reverse - biased diodes .",
    "lock - in detection was used to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , allowing the absorption spectra to be inferred from the wavelength - dependent photocurrent measured in the devices .",
    "the photocurrent spectra for the 7 , 8 , 9 and 14-nm - wide quantum well structures are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : measured - spectra](a  d ) . as expected",
    ", there was a systematic blue shift in the absorption edge as the width of the quantum wells is decreased .",
    "the stark shift at a given applied bias was also larger for the wider quantum wells , as was the reduction in the magnitude of the hh@xmath16 exciton peak that occurs at the absorption edge when a given bias is applied , which results from the larger spatial separation of the electron and hole wavefunctions .    when the dimensions of the quantum wells were decreased , the amount of excitonic broadening increased , as did the amount of indirect absorption ( at a given energy from the direct absorption edge ) .",
    "this suggests that the increased confinement energy of the @xmath2-valley electrons results in a decrease in the @xmath2-valley electron lifetime in the quantum well system . in the following section we describe the energy dependence of the @xmath3 and @xmath17 scattering lifetimes , and go on to relate this to observable features in the absorption spectra , resulting in the simulated spectra that are shown by the dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : measured - spectra ] .",
    "the bandstructure of the strained heterostructure system was calculated using model solid theory with the parameters given in table  [ tab : model - solid - parameters ] in the appendix using the method described in ref .  .",
    "all calculations were performed assuming room temperature conditions of 300k .",
    "the energy gaps between the highest of the strain - split valence band edges and the different conduction band valleys for epitaxially - grown strained ge are plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : bandstructure ] as a function of the composition of the virtual substrate composition .",
    "there is a considerable splitting between the in - plane ( @xmath18 ) and the growth axis ( @xmath19 ) @xmath8-valley states with increasing in - plane compressive strain , as well as an increase in the @xmath2-valley band gap .",
    "this means that scattering from the @xmath2-valley conduction band states into the @xmath18-valleys is allowed for bulk germanium epitaxially grown on a virtual substrate with a ge fraction of around 90% or less . for the ge / si@xmath6ge@xmath7 quantum wells on a si@xmath0ge@xmath1 virtual substrate , we find a @xmath2-valley conduction band offset of 985mev , and heavy- and light - hole band offsets of 306mev and 161mev , respectively .",
    "we used an effective mass model to calculate the confined state electron wavefunctions@xcite with box boundary conditions to contain the ge / sige finite quantum well structure .",
    "intervalley phonon scattering rates from the @xmath2-valley into the @xmath20 and @xmath8 conduction band valleys were evaluated using a zeroth order deformation potential approach using the longitudinal acoustic and optical phonon scattering parameters given in ref .  .",
    "in order to determine the significance of quantum confinement of the electronic states on the scattering rates we compare two approaches : one whereby we treat the initial and final states as subbands , with the variation along the growth - axis described by the confined state wavefunctions of the system , and one where we use the expressions for deformation potential scattering in bulk ge .    in the intersubband approach ,",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 scattering rates were determined from @xmath21 where the subscript @xmath22 refers to the destination valley ( i.e. , either @xmath20 , @xmath19 or @xmath18 ) , so that @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the deformation potentials , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the phonon frequencies , @xmath27 is the relevant bose - einstein phonon occupation number , @xmath28 is the mass density , @xmath29 is the phonon wavevector , @xmath30 is the lattice constant , @xmath31 is the kinetic energy in the @xmath32 destination subband , @xmath33 is the number of equivalent destination valleys , and @xmath34 is the density of states of the destination subband , where @xmath35 refers to emission or absorption of a phonon .",
    "the summation is over all energy - conserving destination subbands for a given process and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the initial ( @xmath2-valley ) and final ( @xmath20 , @xmath19 or @xmath18-valley ) confined - state wavefunctions , respectively .    in the continuum",
    "approach the scattering rates were calculated using the following relation , which describes the @xmath2-valley scattering rates in a bulk semiconductor,@xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the final - state kinetic energy of the destination valley for a given scattering process .",
    "note that here @xmath40 is the 3d density of states in the destination valleys .    in both approaches",
    "the @xmath2-valley inverse scattering lifetime was found by summing the three different rates , i.e. , @xmath41    -valley scattering lifetime components for intervalley scattering into @xmath20 , @xmath19 and @xmath18 as a function of the energy of the @xmath2-valley subband relative to the top of the valence band .",
    "the solid curves show the rates calculated according to the quantum - confined scattering model at zero field and the dashed curves show the rates calculated according to the continuum scattering model . also shown in the dotted curves",
    "are the scattering rates calculated according to the quantum - confined at 100kv / cm . the system is a 14-nm - thick ge quantum well with si@xmath6ge@xmath7 barriers on a si@xmath0ge@xmath1 virtual substrate , and the energy of the @xmath42 subband is indicated for reference.,width=302 ]    figure  [ fig : compare - rates ] shows the scattering rates obtained using both models .",
    "the effects of quantum confinement are reflected in the scattering rates , with the step - like features that result from the quantum - confined density of states of the destination subbands . at zero field the onset of phonon absorption into the first @xmath20-valley subband is seen at 641mev and phonon emission scattering into this subband at 696mev . with an applied field",
    "these features occur energies approximately 10mev smaller , reflecting the stark shift of the @xmath20-valley confined - state wavefunctions .",
    "the small step at 687mev results from the onset of phonon absorption into the second @xmath20-valley subband . at energies larger than @xmath43mev the quantum - confined nature of the scattering rates is no longer apparent , as multiple destination subbands are energetically allowed for the scattering processes .",
    "there is good agreement between the two models in terms of the overall magnitude of the rates ( less than 10% deviation across a range of quantum well dimensions and substrate alloy fractions ) ; the principal difference results from the density of final states , whilst the details of the wavefunctions themselves , as well as the overlaps between them , appear to be unimportant .",
    "therefore , due to the relative simplicity of implementing equation [ eqn : cont ] , we choose to use the continuum method for the subsequent investigation of the @xmath2-valley scattering lifetime .",
    "we model indirect absorption according to the method described in ref .",
    ", so that we have @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the coulomb enhancement factor , @xmath20 is the periodicity of the mqw system ( i.e. , the well width plus the barrier width ) .",
    "the term @xmath46 is the momentum matrix element between the @xmath2-valley electron and hole wavefunctions , which was evaluated using the formalism in ref .  ; at the brillouin zone centre , the reduces to @xmath47 where @xmath48ev is the optical transition matrix element for germanium@xcite and @xmath49 is the electron rest mass .",
    "( away from the zone centre the expression becomes more complex as the hole wavefunctions are given by a linear combination of light - hole , heavy - hole , and spin - orbit split - off basis states . )",
    "the terms @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the wavevectors in the growth plane , the factor of two accounts for spin degeneracy , and @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the angular frequency of the light and @xmath55 is the real part of the refractive index of the material .",
    "the term @xmath56 is the shortfall between the photon energy and the energy of the intermediate @xmath2-valley state , and @xmath57 is the lifetime of the intermediate @xmath2-valley state at that energy , i.e. , the energy corresponding to the absorption of light with a photon energy smaller than the direct absorption edge .",
    "it is for this reason that we determine the intervalley scattering rates as a function of the energy of the @xmath2-valley state relative to the top of the valence band for both the confined and continuum methods , i.e. , for a range of energies including those smaller than the @xmath2-valley band gap .",
    "the excitonic contribution to the spectra from each pair of electron and hole subbands was modelled according to @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the energy difference between a given pair of subband minima , @xmath60 is the exciton binding energy , @xmath61 is the exciton bohr radius , which was determined using a variational energy minimisation approach@xcite and @xmath62 is the voigt profile , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the lifetime and disorder broadening components .",
    "simulated absorption spectra for the four structures are shown by the dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : measured - spectra](a  d ) at zero applied bias and also at the maximum of the applied biases , @xmath65 .",
    "the simulated datasets were calculated based on the method described in ref .   and the parameters listed in the appendix ( table  [ tab : model - solid - parameters ] ) , together with the methodology described above , which were used to determine the lifetime broadening components of the exciton peaks as well as the indirect absorption .",
    "we find very good agreement in the wavelengths of the absorption edge caused by the hh@xmath16 exciton , and the small shifts from the experimentally - measured absorption edge are consistent with a deviation of around 1 from the target well width .",
    "we account for interdiffusion of the ge and sige layers by describing the alloy composition across the ge / sige interface using the gauss error function.@xcite there are a number of values available in the literature for most of the parameters listed in table  [ tab : model - solid - parameters ] , and it is possible to reproduce the measured absorption edge wavelength for the structures reported here using a number of different sets of data .",
    "however , in order to reproduce the light - hole / heavy - hole splitting and the absorption edge for our structures as well as other structures reported previously ( including those in refs .  , where both si@xmath66ge@xmath67 and si@xmath68ge@xmath69 virtual substrates have been used ) , the range of acceptable parameters is considerably reduced .",
    "we found that those parameters listed in table  [ tab : model - solid - parameters ] , together with an interdiffusion length of 2 nm for the structures reported here , gave agreement with the absorption edge of the available experimental data.@xcite    the magnitude of the measured sub - band - gap absorption shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : measured - spectra](a  d ) increased as the width of the quantum wells decreased .",
    "this trend is also present in the simulated indirect absorption in the four different structures , where the increase in the relative magnitude of the indirect absorption results from the increase in @xmath70 .",
    "this happens because the @xmath2-valley ground subband energy is larger in the smaller quantum wells , and hence there will be a larger density of final states in the @xmath20- and @xmath8-valleys available for electrons to scatter into .",
    "the magnitude of the measured sub - band - gap absorption was larger than in the simulated data , especially in the smaller quantum wells .",
    "this may result from the effect of threading dislocations , which have been shown to cause sub - band - gap absorption in highly - strained heteroepitaxial systems with large defect densities.@xcite there are two components of the excitonic broadening : one arising from structural disorder or inhomogeneities , and one arising from the finite lifetime of the @xmath2-valley states .",
    "when comparing to the simulated data it is not straightforward to separate the two , because the voigt profile used to model the excitonic broadening is a convolution of a gaussian with a lorentzian , and so the sum of linewidth broadening components does not equal the resulting linewidth .",
    "our approach to reproducing the measured broadening of the absorption edge was to determine the lifetime broadening contribution to the exciton linewidths using the calculated @xmath2-valley scattering lifetime , and then to adjust the disorder broadening component so that the resulting spectrum has the same lineshape as the measured spectra , giving the simulated datasets shown by the dashed lines in fig .
