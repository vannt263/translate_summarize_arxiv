    "frequency - nondegenerate photon pairs were generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) in a 1-mm - thick type ii bbo ( @xmath0-bab@xmath1o@xmath2 ) crystal pumped by the second harmonic light at 859.4  nm ( 1.5  mw ) of a cw ti : sapphire laser .",
    "the signal and idler photons of the spdc pairs were emitted conically from the focal waist where the pump light was focused on the bbo crystal by a lens of 1000-mm focal length ( l1 ) .",
    "an iris diaphragms ( iris ) was placed at the 100  mm behind the bbo crystal in order to select spatially the crossing point of the signal light cone and the idler light cone where the spdc photon pairs are entangled .",
    "these pairs passed through the iris were collimated by an off - axis parabolic mirror ( m ) of 25.4-mm focal length .",
    "a prism ( p1 ) was used to eliminate the remainder of the pump light , which can be a noise source in the experiments .",
    "another prism ( p2 ) was used to compensate frequency dependent angular dispersion induced by the prism p1 .",
    "when the light beam passes through the prism pairs , the beam height was lowered by a mirror ( m3 ) , and only the spdc pairs were picked out by another mirror ( m2 ) .",
    "the signal and idler photons were separated from each other by a non - polarizing beam splitter ( bs ) . a linear polarizer ( pol1 ) was placed in the light path of idler photons ( photons transmitted the bs ) .",
    "the polarizer was on a motorized continuous rotation stage , and its angle was computer - controlled .",
    "signal photons ( photons reflected by the bs ) were diffracted by a grating ( g ) ( 1400 grooves / mm ) .",
    "another linear polarizer ( pol2 ) was placed in the signal light path , and its angle was also computer - controlled .",
    "for simplification , the state of the spdc photon pair of signal ( @xmath3 ) and idler ( @xmath4 ) photons is assumed to be a pure biphoton state in this article as follows @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are single - photon states with horizontal and vertical polarizations , respectively .",

    "the parameter can be calculated from the coincidence counting rates of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the signal wavelength dependency of the coincidence counting rate of @xmath45 was measured by rotating the grating around the vertical axis crossing the incident point of the signal beam , setting the angles of the polarizers pol1 and pol2 were set to transmit vertically polarized idler photons and horizontally polarized signal photons , respectively .",
    "then , the idler wavelength dependency of the coincidence counting rate of @xmath46 was measured by rotating the grating around the vertical axis crossing the incident point of the idler beam .",
    "this was performed by letting horizontally polarized idler photons and vertically polarized signal photons transmit through pol1 and pol2 by selecting their angles , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "data - spectrum - both ] ) .",
    "( thick curve ) and @xmath46 ( thin curve ) . [ data - spectrum - both ] ]    the results show that the coincidence counting rate of @xmath45 was about three times larger than that of @xmath46 when the signal wavelength was 866  nm , and both rates were nearly balanced when the signal wavelength was 870  nm .",
    "experiment was performed under two conditions as follows .",
    "first , the angle of the grating was set to diffract 866  nm signal photons to the detector , and the diameter of the iris was set to be 1  mm .",
    "figure  [ data - unbalance ] shows the measured polarization correlation .",
    "the fact that @xmath22 and @xmath23 were shifted from @xmath25 by @xmath47 , indicates that even though the spdc photon pairs were entangled but they were not maximally entangled . as is mentioned in the section of theory , the angular rotation was less than @xmath24 if @xmath26",
    "actually , fig .",
    "[ data - spectrum - both ] shows that @xmath48 when the signal wavelength was 866  nm .     and",
    "@xmath46 were not balanced .",
    "marks in the figure show the results measured by rotating the angle of the polarizer pol2 , when the polarizer pol1 was fixed to @xmath49 ( filled circles ) , @xmath24 ( open circles ) , @xmath43 ( filled diamonds ) and @xmath39 ( open diamonds ) , respectively .",
    "curves show the results fitted by a function , @xmath40 with fitting parameters of @xmath41 and @xmath42.[data - unbalance ] ]    second , the angle of the grating was set to couple 870  nm signal photons to the detector , and the diameter of the iris was set to 1  mm .",
    "figure  [ data - balance ] shows the measured result of the polarization correlation .",
    "the shift of @xmath50 was larger than the case when the detector was coupled to 866  nm signal photons .",
    "it is because @xmath51 in this case . actually , the coincidence counting rate of @xmath45 was nearly equal to the rate of @xmath46 ( see fig .  [",
    "data - spectrum - both ] ) .     and @xmath46 were balanced .",
    "marks in the figure show the results measured by rotating the angle of the polarizer pol2 , when the polarizer pol1 was fixed to @xmath49 ( filled circles ) , @xmath24 ( open circles ) , @xmath43 ( filled diamonds ) and @xmath39 ( open diamonds ) , respectively .",
    "curves show the results fitted by a function , @xmath40 with fitting parameters of @xmath41 and @xmath42.[data - balance ] ]    the shift of @xmath50 has increased from about @xmath52 to @xmath27 .",
    "however the shift was still smaller than @xmath24 , and the visibility of the polarization correlation was less than one .",
    "it means the polarization entanglement was not maximized .",
    "it can be improved by compensating walk - off effect and group velocity dispersion in the non - linear crystal .",
    "the compensation can be performed by inserting a half - wave plate and a non - linear crystal of which thickness is half of the crystal which was used to generate spdc photon pairs  @xcite .",
    "there are two points which are necessary to implement an ideal source of wdm - qkd .",
    "one point is that the photon pairs should be broadband in the spectrum and entangled in frequency and polarization .",
    "the generation of the broadband frequency - entangled photon pairs has been succeeded in  @xcite , and the photon pairs can be entangled in polarization with a small modification in the setup as mentioned in  @xcite .",
    "the other point is that the coincidence counts of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are balanced in all over the spectral range of the spdc photon pairs .",
    "it can be accomplished by using optical components whose efficiencies have no polarization dependency . actually , the transmittance / reflectance of the real beam splitter and the diffraction efficiency of the grating have polarization dependency in the real experimental setup used in the present study , resulting in the unbalanced coincidence counts of @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    ". proper improvement of these two points , the spdc photon pairs will be performed in the implementation of wdm - qkd , which can send more information than the normal qkd , because each spectral channel in wdm - qkd can send same amount of information which the normal qkd can transfer .",
    "in conclusion , it was verified that the frequency resolved spdc photon pairs were polarization - entangled in appropriate configurations .",
    "when the iris transmits only photons passing through the crossing point of the signal light cone and the idler light cone , the spdc photon pairs were entangled in polarization .",
    "the shift of @xmath50 was @xmath52 when the coincidence counts of @xmath45 and @xmath46 were unbalanced , and the shift has increased to @xmath27 when they were balanced .",
    "however the observed shift was smaller than @xmath24 .",
    "it means that the polarization entanglement of the photon pairs was not maximized , because of the walk - off effect and group velocity dispersion in the non - linear crystal .",
    "these can be improved by utilizing a half - wave plate and a half - thickness non - linear crystal .",
    "requirements for the real applications of wdm - qkd have been discussed .",
