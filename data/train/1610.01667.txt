    "nearby , young stellar associations ( @xmath210myr ) are the perfect place to study the last stages of the formation of stars and planets . many young stars are surrounded by disks that are the sites of planet formation .",
    "nearby disks , such as the one around tw hydrae , provide ample opportunity to study this process in detail . but to put those observations in context , the ages of these stars must be accurately determined .    ages of young stellar associations can be more accurately determined than those of single stars @xcite . assuming the stars in the association are all born at around the same time",

    "more recently , parallaxes and proper motions of many more stars have been measured @xcite , allowing for more rigorous analyses of kinematics .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , however , disagreed over the traceback analysis ; @xcite claimed no convergence of the association , while @xcite obtained a traceback age of @xmath5myr .",
    "twa candidates are usually identified through a combination of proper motion , spectral signatures of youth , and radial velocities .",
    "the hardest parameter to measure is the parallax .",
    "stars can only truly be classified as members after their full kinematics have been measured . only after membership",
    "is confirmed , do they form a coherent sample in which to study disk evolution or with which to calibrate youth indicators such as li and na equivalent widths . in this paper , we present parallaxes and proper motions of 14 proposed twa members .",
    "this sample expands upon the survey done by @xcite , using the same instrument to double the number of measurements .",
    "we also include 7 parallaxes from the gaia data release 1 catalog @xcite .",

    "a description of the instrument and data taking are given in @xcite and @xcite , and only a few salient points are given here .",
    "the instrument makes use of an independently readable subarray ( the guide window ; gw ) . for our observations",
    "the gw is placed on the relatively bright target star in the center of the full array and read out more rapidly than the full field ( ff ) .",

    "for each image , a set of reference stars are matched to the template , and their positions are averaged together for each epoch .",
    "their apparent motion is then fed into an astrometric model to obtain positions , proper motions , and parallaxes for all stars .",
    "the reference frame is then adjusted to select only those stars with the smallest residuals , and the process is iterated a few more times .",
    "since the position of the target star is measured against the position of background stars , their motion must be taken into account as well .",

    "another star of note is twa 9a .",

    ", twa 9a has an age of @xmath32myr , typical for a twa member .",
    "but with the old hipparcos value , its age is 30myr , which would make it an outlier .",
    "gaia is more precise than hipparcos , but it is unclear why the parallax values for this particular star are so discrepant .",
    "surprisingly , the @xcite parallax value is consistent with the hipparcos value and more than 2@xmath33 higher than the gaia value .    .",

    "see section  [ sub : ages ] and table  [ tab : ages ] for more details . ]",
    "even if outliers are excluded , a spread is observed in the ages of twa stars of a few myr ( see fig .",
    "this could be an intrinsic spread in stellar ages , or it could be due to uncertainties in the calculations due to several factors .",
    "first , there is the uncertainty in the spectral typing , which propagates through to the age via the temperature .",
    "some of these uncertainties are quite large ( @xmath35300k ) , making the location on the pre - main sequence track highly uncertain .",
    "the spectral types were also not all taken from the same sample .",
    "for consistency , we took the spectral types from @xcite where available ( more than a third of our sample ) , but we had to search the literature to find the rest .",
    "the next uncertainty is the conversion from spectral type to effective temperature .",
    "we use the tabulated values of @xcite .",
    "other models are available that will give different values .",
    "the estimated temperature uncertainty between models is 100k .",
    "@xcite did a similar study of a subsample of the twa targets , and their ages for the same stars tend to be older .",
    "they used a different conversion from spectral type to effective temperature , @xcite tracks , and different spectral types for some of the stars .",
    "we use their parallaxes , but our temperatures are systematically cooler , making our resulting ages younger .",
    "@xcite also get a wider spread in ages with an older mean age .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "there is a disagreement between the methods of @xcite and @xcite for converting spectral types to temperature for stars m5 and later .",
    "we have thus looked at a subsample consisting only of stars with spectral types @xmath36 m4 to see if there is a better agreement in the estimated ages of twa members .",
    "we found an average age of @xmath37myr with a median age of 6.2myr .",
    "the picture is even more complicated when looking at the later spectral types .",
    "sources on the m / l boundary tend to show a sharp change in physical properties when moving to later spectral types @xcite .",
    "for these low temperature objects , we are likely probing the region where clouds start to dominate . these objects should be treated differently than the higher mass stars .    to determine if the spread in ages is due to an intrinsic spread or due to measurement uncertainties , we ran a monte carlo simulation of the association .",
    "we created 10,000 synthetics sets of stars , all with an age of 10myr .",
    "we then added a random noise component to each star , taken from a normal distribution centered around zero with the age uncertainty of each star as the standard deviation of the noise distribution .",
    "the measured spread is then the average of the spreads of each trial .",
    "an association with no intrinsic age spread would still have a measured distribution with a standard deviation of @xmath38myr given our uncertainty in the measurement .",
    "this is consistent with the spread seen in fig .",
    "in addition to the observational uncertainties , there are systematic uncertainties involved in modeling of pre - main sequence stars that can cause the spread in ages .",
    "first is the accretion history of the stars .",
    "stocastic accretion events early in a star s life can produce luminosity changes that can explain the spread in the color - magnitude diagrams of young stellar associations @xcite .",
    "this appears as an age spread even when none exists .",
    "various other factors also affect the modeling of pre - main sequence stars , including effects of changing surface gravity as the stars move onto the main sequence , the presence of disks and their impact on accretion and extinction , and stellar activity such as star spots @xcite .",
    "different stellar evolutionary models will produce different isochrones , a result that is much more pronounced for young , low mass stars , which describes much of our sample @xcite",
    ". additional factors such as transforming models to the observational plane and extinction corrections can also produce an observed age spread .",
    "at this point , it is not possible to conclude if there is an intrinsic age spread or not .",
    "the best way to determine if a candidate member of an association is a true member is to compare its properties to those of the core members . given the inability to find a convergence with any subset of stars , there is no good way to determine core members that is not somewhat arbitrary .",
    "we take the approach of starting with the full 38 candidates we have , and cut them down by applying thresholds .",
    "the first step is to cut out the stars that are more likely associated with the nearby lcc .",
    "@xcite defines the border with lcc to be at a distance of 85pc , and gagn  et  al .",
    "( submitted to apjs ) refines this to 80pc .",
    "so we start by excluding the most distant stars , twa 14 , 15a , 15b , 17 , 18 , 19a , 31 , and 2m102542 .",
    "next , to ensure accuracy in our twa core sample , we remove all stars with rv uncertainties great than 1.0kms@xmath25 .",
    "this criterion excludes twa 5 , 6 , 20 , 26 , 28 , 29 , 30a , and 43 .    uncertainty in parallax",
    "also affects the accuracy of the traceback , so we also eliminated sources with parallax uncertainties greater than 1.0mas .",
    "this removes many stars from our core group that are usually considered bona fide members .",
    "we are not implying these stars are not members of twa , we are simply trying to choose a core group that has the most precise measurements and whose members we are sure are related .",
    "lastly , we calculate a mean @xmath14 for the remaining stars and remove the sources with velocities more than 10@xmath16 from the mean in any direction .",
    "this leaves 14 stars that we define as the core members , twa 1 , 8a , 8b , 9a , 10 , 11a , 12 , 13a , 13b , 16 , 23 , 25 , 27 , 32 .",
