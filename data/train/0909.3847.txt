    "in the pre - jwst ( james webb space telescope ) era we depend strongly on the observation of ly@xmath1  emission for both spectroscopic confirmation and , often , the actual discovery of very high - redshift ( @xmath5 ) galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the evolution with redshift of the clustering properties and luminosity function of ly@xmath1  emitters could be used to infer important information about the re - ionization epoch , if the physics governing the ly@xmath1  escape were well understood . in the local universe , where the physical properties of galaxies can in principle be determined in great detail , the number of known ly@xmath1  emitting galaxies is extremely small ( on the order of a dozen objects , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerous theoretical works demonstrate how the observed ly@xmath1  emission and its equivalent width ( ew ) depend on different factors including not only the age of the stellar population , the stellar initial mass function , the metal and dust content @xcite , but also the relative geometries of interstellar h  i  and h  ii  regions and the kinematics of the neutral gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "all of these studies point to a preferential attenuation at resonant frequencies , although it is likely that the homogeneous interstellar medium ( ism ) model is a great over - simplification .",
    "in contrast to the homogeneous case , a multiphase ism in which the dust lies in cold neutral clouds ( which ly@xmath1  photons can not penetrate ) , would actually serve to preserve ly@xmath1  photons , leading to a relative enhancement of the ly@xmath1  ew and the ly@xmath1  / balmer line ratios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this latter mechanism has been proposed to explain the high ly@xmath1  ew sources observed at high redshift @xcite and the high ly@xmath1/h@xmath1  ratio inferred for low-@xmath6 dusty ly@xmath1  emitters @xcite .",

    "the exposure times rangedbetween @xmath15s and @xmath16s . during the observations seeing ranged from 1 to 15 .",
    "the galaxies were observed using a 15 wide slit , providing a spectral resolution of 8  ( i.e. , 280 km s@xmath14  at @xmath0 ) . this resolution is high enough to resolve the h@xmath1  from [ n  ii ]",

    ", we also observed 8 galaxies with the 50 wide slit .",
    "bias subtraction , flat - field normalization , wavelength calibration , and extraction of the 1d spectra were performed with standard iraf packages .",
    "the wavelength - dependent instrumental response was removed by normalizing each spectrum with the response curve derived from the spectrum of a standard star observed in one of our photometric nights .",

    "narrow line agn could not be identified since other diagnostic lines of agn activity were either too faint , or fell in a noisy part of the uv spectra .",
    "in order to identify the narrow line agn , we have used the classic ( * ? ? ? * bpt ) diagram of [ o  iii]/h@xmath3  versus [ n  ii]/h@xmath1(shown in figure  [ fig : agn ] ) .",
    "the theoretical maximum line ratios possible for pure stellar photoionization are shown as a dashed curve in figure  [ fig : agn ] @xcite . to be conservative , we use the @xcite empirical separation between active and star - forming galaxies ( solid line ) .",
    "we find that in 2 of our ly@xmath1emitters the gas is likely to be ionized by an active nucleus .",

    "in the absence of scattering , the ew of a line is by definition unaffected by dust extinction . for this reason , the ly@xmath1  ew",
    "has often been used to study the effect of scattering on the ly@xmath1  photons , by comparing the observed values with those expected theoretically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the intrinsic ly@xmath1  ew is , however , predicted to vary by more than 2 orders of magnitude within the first ten myrs of a star - burst @xcite , and depends on the imf of the stellar population .",
    "the observed line intensities depend only on the number of ionizing photons and the attenuation produced by dust along the line of sight . compared to ew , line ratios are a more direct probe of the obscuration of the line photons . for this reason ,",
    "the comparison of the ratios of resonant to non - resonant lines ( i.e. , ly@xmath1/h@xmath1 ) with the ratio of two non - resonant lines ( h@xmath1/h@xmath3 ) is optimal for quantifying the effects of dust extinction and resonant scattering on the escape of ly@xmath1  photons .    in figure",
    "[ fig : geometry ] we show the ly@xmath1/h@xmath1  ratio as a function of the observed h@xmath1/h@xmath3  ratio .",
    "both quantities are corrected for stellar absorption . in the absence of dust , for case",
    "b recombination , @xmath22 k , and @xmath23 @xmath24 , the expected line ratios are 2.86 and 8.7 , for h@xmath1/h@xmath3 , and ly@xmath1/h@xmath1  respectively @xcite .",
    "the galaxies show a broad range of h@xmath1/h@xmath3values going from the value predicted in case  b recombination theory , up to an h@xmath1/h@xmath3@xmath25 .",
    "apart from one galaxy , the ly@xmath1/h@xmath1  ratio is always smaller than @xmath26% of the value predicted for case  b.    in order to interpret the observed line ratios , we will first ignore the effects of resonant scattering on the ly@xmath1  photons , and consider only the effect of the dust extinction ( derived using the h@xmath1/h@xmath3ratio ) on the ly@xmath1/h@xmath1  ratio .",
    "traditionally , this analysis is carried out under the simplifying assumption that the dust is distributed uniformly in a screen far from the source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although valid for point like sources , this simple approximation is found not to hold in more complex systems , as shown by the analysis of galactic and extragalactic h  ii  regions , where the uniform dust screen approximation fails to reproduce the observed balmer line ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more complex geometries do predict different attenuation laws , with the net effect of removing the linearity between the dust optical depth and the logarithm of the observed line intensity .    in order to illustrate this effect",
    ", we consider here three different geometries of the dust around the line emitting regions : @xmath17 ) uniform dust screen in front of the emitting sources ; @xmath27 ) dust distributed in clumps ; @xmath28 ) sources uniformly mixed within uniform dust .",
    "the light attenuation , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the observed and intrinsic intensities at @xmath31 . ] has a different behavior in the three cases . in model @xmath17 ) the attenuation is given by the classical @xmath32 , where the optical depth @xmath33 follows the appropriate extinction curve , and depends only on the intrinsic grain properties .",
    "we assume that the dust / gas relative geometry does not affect the physical properties of the grains , and we adopt the extinction curve as parametrized by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath34 ) . in model @xmath27 ) @xcite calculate the attenuation assuming that the dust clumps are poissonian distributed , and that all clumps have the same optical depth , @xmath35 . within each clump , @xmath35 follows the @xcite extinction law . if @xmath36 is the average number of clumps along the line of sight , then they find that @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "for a large average number of clumps , and a moderate value of @xmath38 for each clump , the attenuation tends to the uniform dust screen .",
    "however , the two models differ greatly if the clumps have large optical depth . in the limit of opaque clumps",
    ", the attenuation tends towards the constant value of @xmath39 , i.e. , the extinction becomes independent of wavelength , because only the un - extinguished light can be seen . in the third case considered",
    ", @xmath40 goes as @xmath41 @xcite . in this model for @xmath42 ,",
    "the attenuation reaches the asymptotic value of @xmath43 .",
    "curves corresponding to the three models are shown in figure  [ fig : geometry ] with different line styles as indicated on top of the figure .",
    "we use @xmath38 to parametrize the observed line ratios in each of the three models .",
    "the black dots along the curve of the clumpy distribution with @xmath44 are labeled with the optical depth @xmath38 at that position .    in reality , ly@xmath1  photons will be scattered within the clumps , effectively enhancing their chances of being absorbed by dust .",
    "this effect can be folded in into the model by assuming that the optical depth for ly@xmath1  photons , @xmath45 , is higher than the corresponding continuum optical depth , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : geometry ] shows the same models described above , but computed accounting for the scattering of the ly@xmath1  photons , assuming , as an example , @xmath47 . as expected , the net effect of increasing the optical depth of the ly@xmath1photons results in lower values of the ly@xmath1/h@xmath1  ratios for small optical depth .",
    "however , for high values of the optical depth , the asymptotic behavior of the curves remains unchanged , and so do our conclusions .",
    "from figure  [ fig : geometry ] we can see that at h@xmath1/h@xmath3  @xmath48 the uniform dust screen model ( solid line ) predicts an observed ly@xmath1/h@xmath1  ratio of 10% of the case  b value .",
    "clearly , the observed values of ly@xmath1/h@xmath1  for h@xmath1/h@xmath3@xmath49 are much higher than the prediction of a simple dust screen . correcting the ly@xmath1luminosities using the attenuation derived for a uniform dust screen would result in a corrected line ratio hereafter ( ly@xmath1/h@xmath1)@xmath4 well above the predicted value of 8.7 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discuss a multi - phase geometry , where the dust is confined in cold clumps and immersed in ionized gas .",
    "a topology of this kind could serve to shield the ly@xmath1  photons from the effect of the dust absorption , because resonant photons would be scattered _ on the surface _ of the clumps , without crossing them .",
    "the balmer and continuum photons , not affected by the presence of the neutral hydrogen , would pass through the clumps , leading to a relative enhancement of the ly@xmath1  ew _ and _",
    "ly@xmath1  / balmer line ratios .",
    "given the stochastic nature of the ly@xmath1  scattering , this model should also result in some objects with uncorrected ly@xmath1/h@xmath1greater than the predicted case  b value . as noted above",
    ", we do not observe any galaxy with ly@xmath1/h@xmath1@xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , if the continuum is affected by the dust while the ly@xmath1  photons are not , then this should result in a correlation between the ly@xmath1  ew and the observed h@xmath1/h@xmath3  ratio .",
    "in fact the four most extreme cases ( with ly@xmath1/h@xmath1ratios more than 10 times higher the dust screen value ) have among the lowest ew .",
    "a model with the dust uniformly mixed with the sources is not able to reproduce the galaxies with high line ratios ( dashed line in figure  [ fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "this is due to the asymptotic behavior of the attenuation curve for large optical depth .",
    "while in a uniform dust screen the h@xmath1/h@xmath3  ( and ly@xmath1/h@xmath1 ) can reach arbitrarily high ( low ) values , in the uniformly mixed model the observed h@xmath1/h@xmath3  ratio reaches the asymptotic value of @xmath51 , and similarly a ly@xmath1/h@xmath1  of @xmath52 . in this model",
    "the light that is able to reach the observer must come through a thin superficial shell of the galaxy .",
    "figure  [ fig : geometry ] demonstrates that the clumpy dust screen can explain the observed data . by varying the average number of clumps along the line of sight , and the intrinsic optical depth of the clumps , the clumpy distribution of dust allows h@xmath1/h@xmath3  ratios as high as 6 while still allowing a ly@xmath1/h@xmath1  ratio of @xmath53",
    "this is due to the fact that for high values of @xmath38 only the fraction of light that is traveling along sight lines relatively clear of clumps is able to escape the galaxy .",
    "we consider an average number of clumps @xmath36 along the line of sight in the range from 2 to 10 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that galaxies may have different physical structure , depending on the orientation and size of the galaxies , and that they can be statistically described by different values of @xmath36 .    for",
    "three galaxies h@xmath1/h@xmath3  ratio is consistent with 2.86 ( case  b ) , while the ly@xmath1/h@xmath1  ratios are @xmath54% lower than case  b would predict .",
    "such galaxies require an additional mechanism to reduce ly@xmath1without affecting the balmer photons .",
    "possibly , the ly@xmath1  photons pass through a neutral hydrogen cloud , without scattering on its surface .",
    "this would not alter the observed balmer line ratios but could suppress part of the ly@xmath1  photons .",
    "kinematically resolved spectra might test this hypothesis , depending on the kinematics of the h  i  with respect to the h  ii  region .",
    "we have presented the analysis of optical spectra of a sample of 31 @xmath11 ly@xmath1  emitters , previously identified by @xcite .",
    "we find that in 17% of the ly@xmath1  emitters the line ratios require the hard ionizing continuum produced by an agn .",
    "this fraction is in agreement with the fraction of agn discovered in local samples of emission line galaxies , covering a similar range of luminosities .",
    "a uniform dust screen is not able to simultaneously reproduce the observed high values of ly@xmath1/h@xmath1  and h@xmath1/h@xmath3  line ratios .",
    "traditionally , these are explained with _",
    "ad hoc _ multiphase models in which ly@xmath1  photons are shielded from the dust , while non - resonant photons are not ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we consider alternative possibilities for the geometry of the dust around the emitting sources and find that the observed line ratios are well reproduced by a clumpy dust distribution .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that a combination of dusty and uniform medium is responsible for the observed line ratios .",
    "our analysis shows that there is no need to invoke models requiring a significant percentage of ly@xmath1  photons to escape from the galaxy through resonant scattering that avoids the dust .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of a uniform dust screen would result in an over - correction of the ly@xmath1  intensity .",
