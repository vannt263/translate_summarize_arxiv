    "the experimental discovery and investigation of the metastable antiprotonic states in helium have opened a new chapter in the study of antiprotonic atoms ( see comprehensive reviews @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the fundamental properties of the antiproton , these experiments give interesting insights into the interaction of antiprotonic helium with ordinary atoms and molecules .",
    "the data stimulated many theoretical papers on the mechanisms of antiprotonic helium formation , collisional quenching of the metastable states , effects of collisional ( density ) shift and broadening of e1-spectral lines , _ etc_. the detailed study of metastable states of antiprotonic helium by the asacusa collaboration at the ad beam ( cern ) brings further data that pose specific problems in the theory of collisional effects at low temperature ( @xmath16 k ) .",
    "thus , the measurements of hyperfine splitting of antiprotonic helium levels by a triple laser - microwave - laser resonance method @xcite and their interpretation require calculations of the rates of collisional transition between hfs sublevels as well as the density shifts and broadenings of the microwave m1 spectral lines @xcite .    among many experimental results obtained by asacusa collaboration , there is one very specific : the first observation of cold long - lived antiprotonic helium ions @xmath17 in the states with definite quantum numbers ( @xmath18 ) @xcite .",
    "it was observed that these states have lifetimes @xmath19 ns against annihilation , and rates of annihilation @xmath20 increased roughly as a linear function of target density at @xmath21 @xmath22 and temperature @xmath23 k. the antiproton annihilation occurs in the states with small angular momentum , therefore the observed lifetime has to be attributed to the time of transitions from the initial state ( @xmath24 ) to the @xmath25 states .",
    "radiative transitions from the circular orbits ( @xmath26 ) at large @xmath27 are strongly suppressed , therefore a main contribution to the effective rate of annihilation comes from collisional transitions . in this case",
    "the observed values of @xmath28 ( at the given @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) require to have an effective cross section for the initial states @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "this value is an order of magnitude larger than previous theoretical cross sections for collisional stark transitions @xcite relevant to higher kinetic energy corresponding to @xmath33 k. in addition to huge quenching cross sections , the experiment revealed an unexpected @xmath27-dependence and isotope effect ( @xmath34 ) for effective annihilation rates .",
    "these results also can not be explained by earlier considerations of collisional processes of @xmath17 .    in the papers @xcite collisions of cold @xmath35 ion with surrounding helium atoms at @xmath36",
    "k were considered in the framework of close coupling approach with account for the states with all angular momenta @xmath37 from @xmath38 to 0 at the fixed @xmath27 . a model interaction between two colliding subsystems",
    "was taken as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an adiabatic potential of the interaction between the ionic charge ( + 1 ) and he atom , @xmath3 and @xmath1 are distances from the ion center of mass to he atom and from @xmath41 nucleus to @xmath42 , respectively , and @xmath7 is the angle between vectors @xmath9 and @xmath8 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . second and third terms in eq .",
    "take into account interactions of electric dipole and quadrupole momenta of the ion with he atom polarized by the unit ionic charge , so @xmath43 factors @xmath44 and @xmath45 take into account a displacement of a center of charge with respect to center of mass in the @xmath46 system and , for @xmath47 , a difference of two masses too . a correction of order @xmath48 to the scalar term in is omitted .",
    "the dipole and quadrupole terms in can mix @xmath49 states of the ion and lead to stark transition . induced annihilation due to mixing with @xmath50 and @xmath51 states during collisions was also taken into account .",
    "the potential @xmath40 is , in fact , the same as the adiabatic potential of the interaction between proton and he atom .",
    "it was approximated by the sum of the morse potential @xmath52 and the long - range polarization potential cut off at an intermediate distance , @xmath53 -              2\\exp[-\\beta(r - r_e)]\\right\\ } , \\label{eq5 } \\\\",

    "we use atomic units ( @xmath59 ) unless otherwise specified .",
    "this model gives cross sections of stark transitions from circular orbits with @xmath60 at @xmath61 k that are of order or greater than effective quenching cross section @xmath62 .",
    "stark transition rates averaged over thermal motion correlate similarly with the observed effective annihilation rates . thus , the model allows to understand qualitatively the observed data .",
    "moreover , it gives also some isotope effect with correct sign and an increasing of the rates with @xmath27 .",
    "however , if to take into account a whole cascade of stark and radiative transitions from the initial circular orbit up to annihilation from @xmath50 and @xmath51 states , it turns out that the obtained stark cross sections have not enough high values .    a possible improvement of the theory can be to use an _ ab initio _ potential energy surface ( pes ) for three heavy particle in the @xmath63 system instead of the model potential - . in this paper",
    "we calculate the potential energy surface for the mentioned system in the framework of the restricted ( singlet spin state ) hartree - fock method with subsequent account of the electronic correlations within the second order perturbation method ( mp2 ) .",
    "there are very few publications on _ ab initio _ pes calculations for systems involving antiproton and two or three nuclei .",
    "as far as we know , potential energy surfaces for the @xmath64 and @xmath65 systems only were considered in the literature ( see papers @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "a system under consideration in this paper @xmath63 seems to be more simple because it has only two electrons instead of three electrons in the above mentioned systems . on the other hand ,",
    "our system has nonzero total charge that leads to a long - range polarization interaction between subsystem antiprotonic ion - he atom. so far as we know the publications on potential energy surface for the @xmath63 system are absent in the literature .",

    "we used the augmented correlation - consistent polarized valence sextuple zeta aug - cc - pv6z and , for a comparison , quintuple zeta aug - cc - pv5z molecular basis sets @xcite in the cartesian form .",
