    "the possibility of the existence of multiquark states was predicted by qcd inspired models @xcite .",
    "these works initiated a lot of experimental searches for six - quark states ( dibaryons ) .",
    "usually one looked for dibaryons in the @xmath2 channel ( see for review ref .",
    "such dibaryons have decay widths from a few up to hundred mev .",
    "their relative contributions are small enough and the background contribution is big and uncertain as a rule . all this often leads to contradictory results .    in the present work we consider six - quark states , a decay of which into two nucleons",
    "is forbidden by the pauli exclusion principle @xcite .",
    "such states satisfy the following condition : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the isospin , @xmath5 is the internal spin , and @xmath6 is the dibaryon parity . in the @xmath2 channel , these six - quark states would correspond to the following forbidden states : even singlets and odd triplets with the isotopic spin @xmath7 as well as odd singlets and even triplets with .",
    "these six - quark states with the masses ( @xmath8 ) is the nucleon ( pion ) mass ) can mainly decay by emitting a photon .",
    "this is a new class of metastable six - quark states with the decay widths .",
    "such states were called supernarrow dibaryons ( snd ) .",
    "the experimental discovery of the snds would have important consequences for particle and nuclear physics and astrophysics .    in the framework of the mit bag model , mulders et al .",
    "@xcite calculated the masses of different dibaryons , in particular , @xmath2-decoupled dibaryons .",
    "they predicted dibaryons @xmath9 gev )  and @xmath10 gev ) corresponding to the forbidden states @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the @xmath2 channel .",
    "however , the dibaryon masses obtained exceed the pion production threshold . therefore , these dibaryons preferentially decay into the @xmath13 channel and their decay widths are large than 1 mev .    using the chiral soliton model ,",
    "kopeliovich @xcite predicted that the masses of @xmath14 and @xmath15 snds exceeded the two nucleon mass by 60 and 90 mev , respectively .",
    "these values are lower than the pion production threshold .    in the framework of",
    "the canonically quantized biskyrmion model , krupnovnickas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained an indication on possibility of the existence of one dibaryon with j = t=0 and two dibaryons with j = t=1 with masses smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "unfortunately , all values obtained for the dibaryon masses are model dependent .",
    "therefore , only an experiment could answer the question about the existence of snds and determine their masses . in the following ,",
    "we summarize the experimental attempts to look for such snds so far .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the reaction @xmath17 and @xmath18 were studied with the aim of searching for snd .",
    "the experiment was carried out at the proton linear accelerator of inr with 305 mev proton beam using the two - arm mass spectrometer tams . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nucleons and the deuteron from the decay of snd into @xmath19 and @xmath20 have to be emitted into a narrow angle cone with respect to the direction of the dibaryon motion . on the other hand ,",
    "if a dibaryon decays mainly into two nucleons , then the expected angular cone of emitted nucleons must be more than @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , a detection of the scattered proton in coincidence with the proton ( or the deuteron ) from the decay of the dibaryon at correlated angles allows the suppression of the contribution of the background processes and increases the relative contribution of a possible snd production .",
    "several software cuts have been applied to the mass spectra in these works . in particular , the authors limited themselves by the consideration of an interval of the proton energy from the decay of the @xmath22 states , which was determined by the kinematics of the snd decay into @xmath19 channel .",
    "such a cut is very important as it provides a possibility to suppress the contribution from the background reactions and random coincidences essentially .    in the works @xcite , cd@xmath23 and @xmath24c",
    "were used as targets .",
    "the scattered proton was detected in the left arm of the spectrometer tams at the angle @xmath25 .",
    "the second charged particle ( either @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) was detected in the right arm by three telescopes located at @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .    as a result ,",
    "three narrow peaks in missing mass spectra have been observed ( fig .",
    "1a ) at @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 mev with widths equal to the experimental resolution ( @xmath34 mev ) and with numbers of standard deviations ( sd ) of 6.0 , 7.0 , and 6.3 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the dibaryon peaks at @xmath35 and 1926 mev had been observed earlier by same authors in ref .",
    "@xcite at somewhat different kinematical conditions . on the other hand",
    ", no noticeable signal of the dibaryons has been observed in the missing mass @xmath36 spectra of the reaction @xmath18 .",
    "the analysis of the angular distributions of the protons from the decay of @xmath22 states and the suppression observed of the snd decay into @xmath20 showed that the peaks found can be explained as a manifestation of the isovector snds , the decay of which into two nucleons is forbidden by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "an additional information about the nature of the observed states was obtained by studying the missing mass @xmath37 spectra of the reaction @xmath17 .",
    "if the state found is a dibaryon decaying mainly into two nucleons then @xmath38 is a neutron and the mass @xmath37 is equal to the neutron mass @xmath39 . if the value of @xmath37 , obtained from the experiment , differs essentially from @xmath39 then @xmath40 and we have the additional indication that the observed dibaryon is the snd .    the simulation of the missing mass @xmath37 spectra of the reaction @xmath41 has been performed @xcite assuming that the snd decays as @xmath42 through two nucleon singlet state @xmath43 @xcite . as a result , three narrow peaks at @xmath44 , 987 , and 1003 mev have been predicted .",
    "these peaks correspond to the decay of the isovector snds with masses 1904 , 1926 , and 1942 mev , respectively .    in the experimental missing mass @xmath37 spectrum besides the peak at the neutron mass caused by the process @xmath45",
    ", three peaks have been observed at @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 mev @xcite .",
    "these values of @xmath37 coincide with the ones obtained by the simulation and essentially differ from the value of the neutron mass ( 939.6 mev ) . hence , for all states under study , we have @xmath40 in support of the statement that the dibaryons found are snds",
    ".    on the other hand , the peak at @xmath49 mev corresponds to the peak found in ref .",
    "@xcite and was attributed to an exotic baryon state @xmath50 below the @xmath51 threshold . in that work",
    "the authors investigated the reaction @xmath52 and have found altogether three such states with masses 1004 , 1044 , and 1094 mev . therefore ,",
    "if the exotic baryons with anomalously small masses really exist , the observed peaks at 966 , 986 , and 1003 mev might be a manifestation of such states .",
    "the existence of such exotic states , if proved to be true , will fundamentally change our understanding of the quark structure of hadrons @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite these states were considered as possible candidates for pentaquark baryons consisted of @xmath53 and @xmath27 quarks .",
    "however , the experiments on single nucleon have not observed any significant structure @xcite .",
    "therefore , the question about a nature of peaks observed in @xcite is open at present .    in ref .",
    "@xcite dibaryons with exotic quantum numbers were searched for in the process @xmath54 .",
    "the experiment was performed with a proton beam from the jinr phasotron at an energy of about 216 mev .",
    "the energy spectrum of the photons emitted at @xmath55 was measured . as a result",
    ", two peaks have been observed in this spectrum .",
    "this behavior of the photon energy spectrum was interpreted as a signature of the exotic dibaryon resonance @xmath56 with a mass of about 1956 mev and possible isospin @xmath57 . however , the result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite makes the possibility of production of dibaryons with @xmath57 in this reaction questionable .",
    "so , additional careful studies of the reaction @xmath54 are needed to understand more correctly the nature of the observed state .    on the other hand , an analysis @xcite of the uppsala proton - proton bremsstrahlung data looking for the presence of a dibaryon in the mass range from 1900 to 1960 mev only gave the upper limits of 10 and 3 nb for the dibaryon production cross section at proton beam energies of 200 and 310 mev , respectively",
    "this result agrees with the estimates of the cross section obtained at the conditions of this experiment in the framework of the dibaryon production model suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and does not contradict the data of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "gerasimov @xcite suggested that a double radiative capture on the pionic deuterium @xmath58 is a candidate for the further investigation of the narrow dibaryons existence .",
    "the dibaryon in this reaction can be produced via the radiative capture @xmath59 and then it decays to @xmath60 .",
    "such an experiment has been carried out at the triumf cyclotron using the beam of negative pions with a central momentum of 81.5 mev / c @xcite .",
    "no evidence for narrow dibaryons has been found in this work and a branching ratio upper limit , @xmath61 @xmath62 , for narrow @xmath56 production in the mass region from 1920 to 1980 mev was obtained .",
    "this upper limit is several order of magnitude below the yield estimate of gerasimov @xmath63 obtained in a simple model @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath56 is snd , this model does not really take into account a very strong overlap of the baryons which is a necessary condition of the snd production @xcite .",
    "let us make a crude estimation of the branching ratio of snd @xmath64 production by a radiative capture on the pionic deuterium , @xmath65 , assuming that two neutrons in the reaction @xmath66 mainly are in @xmath43 state and using the model suggested in @xcite .",
    "then for the reaction @xmath67 we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 @xcite , @xmath70 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath71 is the probability of the full overlap of two neutrons in @xmath43 state . using the experimental value of the snd production cross section in the process @xmath17 @xcite , one has shown @xcite that the probability of such an overlap of two nucleons in the deuteron ( @xmath72 ) is equal to @xmath73 . supposing that also @xmath74 we obtain @xmath75 this value is one order of magnitude below the upper limit obtained in @xcite .",
    "the reactions @xmath76 and @xmath77 have been investigated also by tamii _",
    "@xcite at the research center for nuclear physics at the proton energy 295 mev in the mass region of 18961914 mev .",
    "they did not observe any narrow structure in this mass region and obtained the upper limit of the production cross section of a nn - decoupled dibaryon is equal to @xmath78 @xmath79b / sr if the dibaryon decay width @xmath80 mev . and if @xmath81 mev , the upper limit will be about @xmath82b / sr . these limits are smaller than the value of the cross section of @xmath83b / sr declared in ref . @xcite .",
    "however , the latter value was overestimated that was caused by not taking into account angle fluctuations related to a beam position displacement on the cd@xmath23 target during the run .",
    "the beam displacement during a run decreased the efficiency for the elastic scattering and practically did not do that for the dibaryon formation reaction because of a wider cone of outgoing particles for the latter .",
    "as was shown in the next experimental runs , the real value of the cross sections of the production of the snd with the mass 1904 mev must be smaller by 23 times than that was estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", simulation shows that the energy distribution of the protons from the decay of the snd with the mass of 1904 mev is rather narrow with the maximum at @xmath84 mev .",
    "this distribution occupies the energy region of 6090mev .",
    "the experiments @xcite confirmed the result of this simulation .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors considered the region 74130 mev .",
    "therefore , they could detect only a small part of the snd contribution .",
    "moreover , they used a very large angular acceptance of the spectrometer which detected these protons , while the protons under consideration have to fly in very narrow angle cone . as a result ,",
    "the effect - to - background ratio in this experiment was more than 10 times less than in ref .",
    "@xcite . very big errors and absence of proper proton energy and angular cuts in ref .",
    "@xcite did not allow authors to observe any structure in the @xmath22 mass spectrum .",
    "it is worth noting that the reaction @xmath85 was investigated in other works , too ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , in contrast to the ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors of these works did not study either the correlation between the parameters of the scattered proton and the second detected particle or the emission of the photon from the dibaryon decay .",
    "therefore , in these works the relative contribution of the dibaryons under consideration was small , which hampered their observation",
    ".    however , in order to argue more convincingly that the states found are really snds , an additional experimental investigation of the dibaryon production is needed .    on this point ,",
    "the search for the snds in processes of the pion photoproduction from the deuteron is of great interest . besides a decision of the question about an existence of the snds , an investigation of this process will allow the quantum numbers of the snds to be determined . and",
    "the experiment with the linear polarized photons will give possibility to determine other quantum numbers of the snds @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite narrow dibaryon resonances were searched for in the reaction @xmath86 in the photon energy region 140300 mev .",
    "no significant structure has been observed .",
    "upper limits for the production of narrow dibaryons in the range 25 @xmath79b averaged over the 0.8 mev resolution has been observed .",
    "however , the expected values of the snd production cross section are essentially less . the estimation of the total cross section of the snd production in this process in the photon energy region 200300 mev ( see sec .",
    "3 ) gives 0.010.03 @xmath79b for the dibaryon @xmath87 with the mass 1904 mev and it is less for the vector snd and the higher masses .",
    "essentially bigger cross sections are expected for the snd production in the processes of the charged pion photoproduction .",
    "we propose to search for the snds by studying the reactions @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 in the photon energy region 300800 mev at mami .",
    "the mass of the snds will be reconstructed by the measurement of the photon and two nucleons .",
    "the detection of the pions will permit the background to be suppressed additionally .",
    "using of a deuteron target allows avoiding uncertainties taken place in ref .",
    "@xcite where cd@xmath23 target was used .",
    "furthermore , use of the photon beam with the energies of 300800 mev and the crystal ball spectrometer and taps will give a possibility to suppress essentially background and to investigate a wide mass spectrum and , particular , check the possibility of existence of the snds at @xmath91 @xcite and 1982 mev .",
    "the latter one was predicted in @xcite .",
    "this experiment can also help to understand nature of the peaks in the @xmath37 mass spectra and clarify a possibility of existence of exotic baryons with small masses .",
    "we will consider the following snds : @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "it is worth noting that the state @xmath95 corresponds to the states @xmath12 and @xmath96 in the nn channel .",
    "the former is forbidden and the latter is allowed for a two - nucleon state . in our work",
    "we will study the dibaryon @xmath94 , a decay of which into two nucleons is forbidden by the pauli principle ( i.e. @xmath12 state ) .    in the process @xmath97",
    ", snds can be produced only if the nucleons in the deuteron overlap sufficiently , such that a 6-quark state with deuteron quantum numbers can be formed . in this case ,",
    "an interaction of a photon or a meson with this state can change its quantum numbers so that a metastable state is formed .",
    "therefore , the probability of the production of such dibaryons is proportional to the probability @xmath72 of the 6-quark state existing in the deuteron .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath72 can be estimated from the deuteron form factor at large @xmath98 ( see for example @xcite ) . however , the values obtained depend strongly on the model of the form factor of the 6-quark state over a broad region of @xmath98 . another way to estimate",
    "this parameter is to use the discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values of the deuteron magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "this method is free from the restrictions quoted above and gives @xmath99 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the magnitude of @xmath72 was estimated by an analysis of the mass formula for snds using the experimental value of the cross section of the snd production in the process @xmath17 obtained in @xcite . as a result , @xmath100 has been obtained .",
    "since the energy of nucleons , produced in the decay of the snds under study with @xmath101 , is small , it may be expected that the main contribution to a two nucleon system should come from the @xmath43 ( virtual singlet ) state ( fig .",
    "[ dec ] ) .",
    "the results of calculations of the decay widths of the dibaryons into @xmath102 on the basis of such assumptions at @xmath103 are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
