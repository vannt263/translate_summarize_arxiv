    "<S> discovered as early as 1964@xcite , the superconducting state of n - doped srtio@xmath2 occupies a singular place in the history of superconductivity . besides being the first oxide superconductor , it was one of the earliest `` semiconducting superconductors''@xcite , the first experimentally - detected multi - gap superconductor@xcite and the first case of a superconducting dome@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> half a century after its discovery , it remains the most dilute superconductor with its cooper pairs springing out of the tiniest fermi surface known to undergo such a transition@xcite .    in spite of this importance , and the intense attention devoted to the two - dimensional superconductivity discovered in srtio@xmath2 heterojunctions@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter of this system has remained a virgin field of exploration . besides the early report on two distinct superconducting gaps detected by planar tunneling experiments@xcite , little is known about the superconducting gap and its structure . in absence of any experimental data coming from bulk probes , the existence of nodes in the superconducting gap remains an open question . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in contrast to early tunneling experiments , a recent study on superconducting interfaces did not detect multiple superconducting gaps@xcite .    in the past two decades , </S>",
    "<S> thermal conductivity has emerged as a sensitive probe of nodal quasi - particles@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been used to detect nodal and nodeless gaps of a variety of unconventional superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the list includes heavy - fermion @xcite , cuprate@xcite , ruthenate@xcite , organic@xcite and iron - based@xcite superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> thermal conductivity has also been used to establish the multiplicity of superconducting gaps . beyond the emblematic case of mgb@xmath4@xcite , several other extensively - studied superconductors , including nbse@xmath4@xcite and cecoin@xmath5@xcite </S>",
    "<S> were identified as multi - band superconductors thanks to thermal conductivity measurements . in this paper , we present the first study of thermal conductivity in optimally - doped strontium titanate and find unambiguous evidence for the absence of nodal quasi - particles and for the multiplicity of superconducting gaps . </S>",
    "<S> this paves the way for the identification of the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter and the determination of the relative weight of interband and intraband pairing strength@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the srtio@xmath2:nb single crystals used in this study were commercial substrates like those used in previous studies on metal - insulator transition @xciteand fermiology@xcite in n - doped srtio@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1a presents the doping dependence of resistive superconducting transition in these samples . </S>",
    "<S> the carrier concentration was determined by measuring the hall coefficient and was found to be in good agreement with the expected value according to the nominal nb content . </S>",
    "<S> the latter was directly checked by secondary ion beam mass spectroscopy ( sims ) ( see the supplement ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the sample chosen for an extended study has a resistive critical temperature as high as 0.44 k ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to its relatively high carrier concentration , it has a predominant electronic contribution to its specific heat and thermal conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> this sample was cut into two pieces . </S>",
    "<S> one was used for a study of heat capacity and the other for transport . </S>",
    "<S> thermal conductivity , concomitant with electrical resistivity , was measured by a standard one - heater - two - thermometers set - up . </S>",
    "<S> measurements were also carried out on three other samples with different carrier concentration and led to similar results ( see the supplement ) . the focus here will be on the extended set of data obtained on one particular sample .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b presents the jump in specific heat caused by superconducting transition . </S>",
    "<S> an early measurement , limited downward to 0.3 k , detected the beginning of an upturn in specific heat@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our observation definitely confirms that this is a phase transition of bulk electrons . </S>",
    "<S> two other pieces of information can be extracted from the specific heat data . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the onset temperature of bulk superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in the figure , the jump starts at 0.33 k , significantly lower than the temperature at which resistivity vanishes ( @xmath6 0.35 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , the magnitude of the t - linear electronic specific heat in the normal state ( @xmath7 mj mol@xmath8 ) is remarkably large for a dilute metal with a carrier concentration of n@xmath9=2.6@xmath10 10@xmath11 @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> copper , with a carrier density 300 times larger has a @xmath13 twice lower . </S>",
    "<S> the large @xmath13 is a consequence of significant mass enhancement in doped srtio@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> if all electrons were in a single spherical fermi surface , using the expression @xmath14 , one would find an effective mass of m@xmath15=4.2 m@xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees with the conclusions of the study of quantum oscillations , according to which , when the carrier concentration exceeds 2@xmath1010@xmath17 @xmath12 , three bands are occupied with most carriers residing in the lowest and heaviest band with an effective mass as large as @xmath18@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , two distinct experimental probes converge in finding an effective mass twice as large as the band mass@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the thermal conductivity data is also shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in the figure , @xmath19 does not show any detectable feature at resistive t@xmath3 , but starts to deviate from its normal - state value as soon as the jump in specific heat starts . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk phase transition begins at a temperature , which is 20 mk lower than the end of the resistive transition . </S>",
    "<S> we will come back to this feature below .    </S>",
    "<S> the first experimental check on the accuracy of our thermal conductivity data is the verification of the wiedemann - franz ( wf ) law . as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a , the normal - state thermal conductivity extrapolates to slightly below 0.22 mwk@xmath20 at zero temperature . given the residual resistivity of the sample ( 110 @xmath21 cm ) , one finds a lorenz number close to the expected l@xmath22=2.44 @xmath1010@xmath23 v@xmath24k@xmath25 . as seen in the figure , at the onset of resistive superconducting transition , @xmath26 is nine - tenth of @xmath19 , implying an electron contribution roughly ten times the lattice component of heat transport . </S>",
    "<S> this simplifies the analysis and strengthen the conclusion .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2b presents the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity at different magnetic fields . at 0.6 t </S>",
    "<S> , superconductivity is destroyed and thermal conductivity yields a large linear term , very close to the zero - field value and the expected wf value . in the absence of magnetic field , in the superconducting state , thermal conductivity rapidly decreases with decreasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in the figure , in this case , a linear extrapolation of @xmath19 vs. @xmath27 to t=0 has no detectable intercept . </S>",
    "<S> this result , reproduced on other samples with different carrier concentration and mobilities ( see the supplement ) , is the first main result of this work . in presence of nodal quasi - particles </S>",
    "<S> , one would expect a residual t - linear term in thermal conduction , on top of phononic t@xmath28 term@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly not our case .    the t@xmath29 term of thermal conductivity sets an upper limit to the phonon conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> using the kinetic formula , @xmath30=1/3 c@xmath31v@xmath32 and the reported values for lattice heat capacity ( c@xmath31=@xmath33 t@xmath28 ; @xmath33=jk@xmath34m@xmath35@xcite ) and average sound velocity ( @xmath36v@xmath37=5300 ms@xmath38@xcite ) , one can estimate the upper limit to the phonon mean - free - path of phonons . if @xmath30=bt@xmath28 with b=3.8 mwk@xmath34cm@xmath38 one obtains a phonon mean - free - path of 0.35 mm , to be compared with sample thickness of 1 mm . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even at temperatures as low as 0.1 k , and in the absence of scattering by electrons , phonon transport may not be fully ballistic . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the structural transition at 105 k , in absence of strain , would create three equivalent tetragonal domains in a srtio@xmath2 single crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the domain boundaries , which are macroscopically long @xcite , may play a role in setting the ultimate low - temperature mean - free - path of phonons .    in presence of b=0.6 t , </S>",
    "<S> when the normal state survives down to the lowest temperature , one can use the wiedemann - franz to separate the electronic , @xmath40 , and lattice , @xmath41 , components of thermal conductivity . in the superconducting state , on the other hand , one can not separate @xmath42 and @xmath43 in a straightforward fashion . by vanishing in to the superconducting condensate </S>",
    "<S> , electrons open the road for an enhanced lattice conductivity of unknown magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> an upper bound to the lattice conductivity is given by the magnitude of the asymptotic t@xmath28 thermal conductivity . by assuming that the phonon mean - free - path linearly increases from t@xmath3 to its maximum value at 0.1 k , with @xmath43 accounting for half of the total thermal conductivity , we found a @xmath44 in excellent agreement to the bardeen , rickayzen and tewordt ( brt ) function with plausible parameters ( a t@xmath3 of 0.33 k and a gap of 0.74 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> this function is the cornerstone of the standard theory of heat transport in a conventional superconductor@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the decomposition of thermal conductivity to its lattice and electronic components , as well as the fit to the brt function are shown in the two panels of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . given the arbitrary assumption on @xmath45 mentioned above , this should only be taken as a qualitative sketch . </S>",
    "<S> a t@xmath3 of 0.33 k is in excellent agreement with the heat capacity data and a gap of 0.74 k ( = 64 @xmath46ev ) is close to what was seen by tunneling measurements close to this doping range(60 - 80@xmath47ev)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that these would yield a @xmath48 ratio of 2.2 , compared to the bcs value of 1.76 .    up to here , no feature of heat transport distinguishes this superconductor from aluminum , in which the brt function was experimentally checked decades ago@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as soon as one examines the effect of magnetic field , however , such a distinction becomes visible . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , the application of a small magnetic field , much lower than the upper critical field , h@xmath49 , substantially modifies the magnitude of thermal conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by sweeping the magnetic field from zero to h@xmath49 , a shoulder is detectable in @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> both these features , were detected in multi - band superconductors@xcite and were interpreted as the signatures of multi - gap superconductivity .    in a nodeless single - band superconductor , </S>",
    "<S> the application of magnetic field , as far as the distance between vortices keep the quasi - particles trapped inside the normal cores of vortices , does not affect heat transport . on the other hand , in a multi - band superconductor </S>",
    "<S> , a modest magnetic field can significantly enhance thermal conductivity by closing the smaller gap . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in the lower inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a , which compares our case with three other superconductors , this is the case of nb - doped srtio@xmath2 .    thermal conductivity becomes independent of magnetic field above a threshold magnetic field , which is 0.08 t at 0.097 k ( see the upper inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this field is the bulk upper critical field , h@xmath51 . below a second field scale , h@xmath15 , lower than h@xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> , thermal conductivity shows a steeper field dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this second field scale points to the existence of an additional superconducting coherence length set by a second superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> we did not detect a third scale of magnetic filed in this three - band system . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> our results are similar to those reported by binnig _ </S>",
    "<S> _ et al.__@xcite , who detected two [ and not three ] distinct superconducting gaps . </S>",
    "<S> two possibilities come to mind . </S>",
    "<S> either two of the bands have gaps of almost identical magnitudes , or the one associated with the third band ( and the corresponding field scale ) are too small to be easily detectable . </S>",
    "<S> the initial rise of thermal conductivity by a small magnetic field , much lower than h@xmath15 is either due to the existence of a third field scale much smaller than the other two , or a strong anisotropy of one of the two detected gaps .    as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4b , the bulk upper critical field is significantly lower than the resistive upper critical field . </S>",
    "<S> the result is confirmed by specific heat data in presence of magnetic field ( see the supplement ) . </S>",
    "<S> this brings us back to the shift observed at zero magnetic field between bulk transition temperature and vanishing resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> in a portion of the ( b , t ) plane , bulk electrons are still normal , but the system shows zero resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> this calls for an explanation . invoking sample inhomogeneity </S>",
    "<S> does not provide an answer . in a wide doping range , </S>",
    "<S> the critical temperature does not show a strong dependence on doping . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the observation of quantum oscillations with a well - defined frequency corresponding to the density of bulk carriers estimated from hall effect puts an upper limit to any macroscopic inhomogeneity .    one place for superconductivity to survive when bulk electrons are normal are boundaries between tetragonal domains . </S>",
    "<S> if the critical temperature happens to be higher in these twin boundaries than in the bulk , one can observe a vanishing resistivity at a temperature well above the bulk critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> recent near - field studies on the sto interfaces have detected enhanced electrical conductivity along twin boundaries @xcite , providing plausibility to this speculation .    in summary , we find that optimally - doped srtio@xmath2:nb is a multi - gap superconductor and none of its gaps has nodes </S>",
    "<S> . these are new pieces in this puzzle of exceptionally dilute superconductivity , for which several exotic pairing mechanisms ( such as a phonon soft mode @xcite , plasmons@xcite or ferroelectric quantum criticality@xcite ) have been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to all other known cases of multi - band superconductivity , one can here tune the fermi surface ( in sheer size as well as the number of its components ) across several orders of doping concentration . </S>",
    "<S> this provides new experimental opportunities and stronger constraints for theory .    </S>",
    "<S> this work is supported by agence nationale de la recherche as a part of quantherm and superfield projects .    </S>",
