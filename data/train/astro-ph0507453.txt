    "brown dwarfs ( bds ) are objects with masses intermediate between those of stars and planets . as such , studies of bds",
    "potentially can offer a unique link between theories of star formation and planet formation .",
    "several bd formation scenarios have been proposed , but current observational results indicate that the properties of bds , including their spatial distribution in star - forming regions @xcite , velocity dispersion @xcite , accretion and inner disk frequency @xcite , and evidence for an embedded phase @xcite , are consistent with those of low - mass stars .",
    "although this strongly supports the idea that bds form in a fashion similar to stars , via the dynamical collapse and fragmentation of a cloud core , there is emerging evidence that the binary properties of brown dwarfs are fundamentally different from those of low - mass stars .",
    "multiplicity surveys of field t dwarfs @xcite , l dwarfs @xcite , late m dwarfs @xcite and intermediate - age bds in the pleiades @xcite have found lower binary frequencies and smaller binary separations than for field g and early m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "it is unclear if these binary properties reflect differences in the formation mechanism or the dynamical disruption of wide substellar binaries .",
    "one way to distinguish between these scenarios is by studying the properties of young bd binaries , possibly before any significant dynamical evolution has occurred . in this paper",
    "we present the results of an imaging multiplicity survey of brown dwarfs in the nearest ( @xmath0145 pc ) young ( @xmath05 myr)@xcite ob association , upper scorpius .",
    "our targets were selected from the survey for low - mass members of upper sco by @xcite .",
    "they identified 15 candidate members with spectral types of m5.5 or cooler , based on either low resolution spectra ( 10 objects ) or @xmath18 colors ( 5 objects ) .",
    "three of these 15 ( usco 85 , 114 , 121 ) were determined to be likely non - members , based on low lithium abundance and radial velocities that are inconsistent with higher mass members @xcite .",
    "the remaining 12 were observed in this program .",
    "subsequently , membership for all but the faintest member of this sample , usco 137 , has been confirmed with additional high resolution spectra @xcite .",
    "usco 137 has not yet been observed spectroscopically .",
    "since our targets include both very low mass stars and brown dwarfs , we hereafter refer to them as very low mass objects , or vlmos .",
    "our images were obtained with the advanced camera for surveys / high resolution camera on the hubble space telescope , which has a field of view of 26x29and distortion - corrected pixel size of 27 mas pix@xmath19 .",
    "observations were made between july and september 2003 with the filters f555w ( v ) , f775w ( i ) , and f850lp ( z ) at two dither positions near the center of the detector and with two exposures per position .",
    "total integration times were 510 , 300 , and 200 seconds , respectively .",
    "the f555w exposure times for the brightest objects ( usco-55 , 66 , 67 , and 75 ) was reduced to 350 seconds to allow for additional short exposures in f775w and f850lp , which were close to the saturation limit in the full - length exposures .",
    "we chose the v band to maximize angular resolution ( diffraction limit @xmath20 mas ) and the i and z bands to maximize sensitivity to very low mass companions .",
    "the raw images were calibrated and distortion - corrected by the calacs pipeline during on - the - fly - reprocessing @xcite .",
    "some cosmic rays remained , but their morphologies were substantially different from stellar psfs , so they were easily identified by visual inspection .",
    "potential point sources were identified with the iraf task daophot / daofind , which found all local brightness maxima with a significance of @xmath21 and a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) near the expected value for the filter .",
    "we then measured aperture photometry and point - spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry for all objects in each field , and we report aperture photometry for all isolated objects and psf photometry for all close binaries .",
    "psf magnitudes were corrected to match aperture magnitudes based on results for the nine well - sampled objects that appeared isolated under visual inspection .",
    "aperture photometry was carried out with the iraf task daophot / phot with a 5-pixel aperture for faint objects and a 10-pixel aperture for bright objects , and our sky annulus had an inner radius of 200 pixels and width of 15 pixels .",
    "we used the finite aperture corrections of @xcite .",
    "point - spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry was carried out with the iraf task daophot / allstar @xcite .",
    "the psf for each filter was constructed from the 9 isolated vlmos .",
    "since all of the targets were located near the center of the chip and have similar temperatures and extinctions , location and color effects should not be important .",
    "there was some variation in the psf fwhm from target to target ( @xmath22 ) , which we attribute to small orbit - to - orbit changes in focus .",
    "however , the radial shape of the psf was very similar for all objects except usco-109 , which we will discuss in more detail in section 3.1 .",
    "transformations to ground - based magnitudes ( @xmath2 , sdss @xmath4 , and sdss @xmath6 ) were calculated with the iraf task synphot / calcphot , which convolves an input spectrum with transmission curves for hst s optics and filters or standard ground - based filters .",
    "since synphot does not include transmission curves for the i and z filters , which are defined at the united states naval observatory 40-in telescope , they were obtained from the website for the sloan digital sky survey and represent the filters and optics at the usno-40 observing at 1.3 airmasses @xcite .",
    "based on transformations determined for a set of m0-m8 dwarfs and m5-m8 giants from the bruzual - persson - gunn - stryker spectrophotometry atlas @xcite , we find constant corrections that do not depend significantly on temperature or surface gravity : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the uncertainties are estimated from the standard deviation between all tested objects .",
    "the transformed magnitudes are listed in table 1 .",
    "the statistical uncertainties correspond to either the photon noise ( for aperture photometry ; typically @xmath260.01 magnitudes ) or the goodness of fit ( for psf - fitting photometry ; 0.02 - 0.09 magnitudes ) .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the magnitude transformations and aperture corrections are @xmath00.03 magnitudes .",

    "in figure 1 , we present contour plots of three candidate binaries ( usco-55 , 66 , and 109 ) and the apparently single star usco-67 in the f555w , f775w , and f850lp filters .",
    "the usco-55 and usco-66 systems are clearly resolved .",
    "the usco-109 system is not obviously resolved and was not initially reported as a double - source by allstar , but the psf appears to be marginally elongated in the + x direction relative to the single vlmo usco-67 .",
    "one limitation in the allstar - based data reduction method is that binaries with very close ( @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30 ) separations are often not identified , even when their combined psf is elongated at a high confidence level .",
    "daofind , the task which identifies potential objects in the images , only identifies point sources based on the presence of a distinct peak .",
    "thus , automated photometry will be biased against the detection of very close binaries .",
    "this limitation can be overcome for known or suspected binaries by manually adding a second point source in approximately the correct location and letting allstar recenter it to optimize the fit ; if it does not produce a statistically significant fit , allstar then discards it .",
    "we have done this for usco-109 .    in figure 2 , we present plots for usco-109 and the next - brightest object in the same images , a likely background field star ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "the first three columns show usco-109 and the residuals from fitting with one and then two point sources , and the last two columns show the field star and its single - source fit .",
    "the maximum and minimum pixel values are also given to allow quantitative comparison of the residuals to the original images .",
    "the common position angle of the residuals in the single - source fit in all three filters seems to imply that this elongation is a real effect , and not simply noise .",
    "usco-109 appears elongated in the same direction relative to both its neighbor and usco-67 ; this extension is therefore unlikely to be an artifact due to excess jitter , which would affect the field star as well .",
    "usco-109 is better fit with two point sources in all three filters , and the fit reduces the residuals by factors of 2 - 8 .",
    "moreover , these fits independently find similar positions and flux ratios in all three filters , which further supports its classification as a binary system .",
    "since the similar two - source residuals in each filter imply some remaining uncertainty in the fit and the separation is only @xmath01.3 pixels , followup observation of this system to confirm its multiplicity and properties should be a priority .",

    "also shown are the average main sequence at the distance of upper sco @xcite and a 5 myr isochrone based on the evolutionary models of @xcite .",
    "the location of the isochrone is determined by converting the predicted @xmath33 and @xmath34 magnitudes to @xmath4 and @xmath6 magnitudes , using @xmath35 colors derived using the methods described in section 2 and @xmath36 colors found from the sdss field main sequence for older , more massive m dwarfs by @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath35 transformations should be accurate ( section 2 ) , the @xmath36 transformations may be more sensitive to surface gravity differences due to the larger difference in central wavelengths .",
    "consequently , the @xmath31 color of the 5 myr isochrone is somewhat uncertain .",
    "the three very close companions to usco-55 , usco-66 , and usco-109 are located above the sdss main sequence and well above the background population , so they are most likely association members . based on their close proximity and the low density of association members ,",
    "we conclude that these are physically associated companions .",
    "all other objects fall well below the empirical main sequence and are most likely background stars . the marginally resolved companion to usco-109 resides near the empirical ( but somewhat uncertain ) main sequence , but given the uncertainty in its @xmath31 color , its location is consistent with the broad luminosity distribution of low - mass upper sco members that we discuss in section 5 .",
    "we determined detection limits as a function of distance from the primary stars via a monte carlo simulation similar to that of @xcite .",
    "we used the iraf task daophot / addstar and our average psf to add artificial stars at a range of radial separations and magnitudes to the fields of usco-67 , usco-128 , and usco-137 , which represent the maximum , median , and minimum brightness sources in our sample .",
    "we then attempted to identify them with our allstar photometry pipeline . in figure 4 , we show the detection limits for the usco-67 and usco-128 fields in v and z , as a function of separation , at which we can detect @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 of the companions . at small separations ( @xmath2820 au ) , the 50% detection thresholds roughly scale with the brightness of the primary ; they are similar for all objects in terms of @xmath40@xmath41 .",
    "the detection limits converge to constant values at large separations where the background dominates the noise : @xmath6=23.40@xmath270.05 , @xmath4225.08@xmath270.05 , and @xmath2=26.01@xmath270.05 ( uncertainties are based on the standard deviation between the three fields ) .",
    "the simulations demonstrate that we potentially could identify bright pairs as close at 1 pixel ( 0.027 ; 4 au ) but none closer .",
    "we also show the locations ( in @xmath40@xmath41 and separation ) of the three companions to usco-55 , 66 , and 109 .",
    "these results indicate that the probability of detecting a system with the separation and flux ratio of usco-109 with automated photometry is between 10% and 50% for the brightest objects and becomes negligible for the fainter targets in our sample . however , as discussed in section 2 , these limits are conservative at small separations since allstar often reports only a single point source when the psf is still noticeably elongated and manual fitting can distinguish two point sources . the position angle of the binary can also play a role in the detection probability ; as can be seen in figure 1 , the blended psf of usco-109 is elongated along the axis where the psf is narrowest , providing the most significant possible detection .",
    "artificial star tests show that if the companion was near one of the extended lobes of the psf , it would have been much more difficult to identify .",
    "a similar monte carlo routine was used to test the uncertainties in the measurements of usco-109 .",
    "we used addstar and the average psf to construct 100 simulated images , given the positions and brightnesses reported for the primary and the secondary for the real images , and then used allstar to perform psf - fitting photometry on these simulated images .",
    "the standard deviation in separation ( @xmath01 mas ) from the simulated images is consistent with that calculated from the standard deviation in separation between the three filters ( @xmath02 mas ) , and the standard deviation in the flux ratio @xmath40@xmath41 ( 0.09 magnitudes in @xmath2 , 0.06 in @xmath4 and @xmath6 ) is consistent with that determined from the magnitudes reported by allstar for each object .",

    "we can estimate the number of undetected companions via a method based on that of @xcite where we convolve an assumed mass ratio distribution with the mass - magnitude relations of @xcite and the detection thresholds @xmath40@xmath41 as calculated in section 4.3 .",

    "if we adopt a mass ratio distribution that is uniform between 0.6 and 1.0 and zero for @xmath50 , then the detection thresholds in figure 4 can be used to predict the number of unidentified companions .",
    "the @xmath38 detection limit spans the full range of possible mass ratios at separations @xmath5110 au , and then approaches @xmath40@xmath52 at a separation of @xmath04 au .",
    "the average threshold of @xmath40@xmath53 in the separation range @xmath54 au corresponds to a detection threshold of @xmath55 .",
    "this implies that all companions outside 10 au and @xmath01/2 of all companions inside 10 au were detected .",

    "the implication is that the mass ratio distribution is not flat at low masses , but instead is biased toward binaries of nearly - equal mass .",

    "dividing the sample into spectral type bins reveals no spectral type dependence of the binary frequency , though the subsample sizes are not sufficient to completely rule out a gradual decline . specifically , the survey found a binary frequency of 26/50 = @xmath77 for upper sco members of spectral type m0-m5 ( @xmath78 ) for separations between 19 and 870 au , including several very wide companions to primaries in the m4-m5 range .",

    "they also found no decline in mean or maximum separation and no preference toward equal - mass companions with decreasing mass , though the mass ratio result could not be tested for the lowest - mass targets since unequal - mass companions would have fallen below the detection limit .",
    "our measurements in the mass range @xmath82 suggest a significant decrease in the number of wide binaries .",

    "we also note that resolving the newly - discovered binaries does not reduce the large scatter in the color - magnitude diagram at low masses that has been observed in previous surveys @xcite and is evident for the apparently single vlmos in figure 1 .",
    "@xcite argue for a consistent age of 5 myr based on the narrow locus seen on color - magnitude diagrams of more massive upper sco members , but the poor fit between our data and any single isochrone of @xcite indicates that the lowest - mass members of upper sco could have a significant range in ages or distances .",
    "the uncertainty introduced by transforming of the 5 myr isochrone into the sdss magnitude system makes it difficult to interpret other possibilities , such as the existence of additional unresolved binaries or preferential selection of older or younger systems in the original survey by ardila et al .    in summary ,",
    "the binary properties of the young vlmos observed here are the first convincing evidence that the small separations and equal mass ratios of vlmo binaries are established at young ages rather than as the result of subsequent dynamical evolution after the t tauri phase of evolution .",
    "the uncertainty in our total binary fraction is too large to directly test the suggestion that the binary fraction declines with declining mass , but if the total binary fraction of the field population is truly primordial , as the small separations and equal masses appear to be , then this provides powerful evidence in support of this assertion . however , complementary spectroscopic surveys are needed to determine if the apparent deficit of substellar binaries is a true absence or is due to a shift to smaller separations than can be detected with imaging alone .",
    "finally , the recent discovery of candidate wide binary systems in the low - density star - forming regions chamaeleon i @xcite and tw hydra @xcite indicate that there could be differences in the vlmo binary formation process and initial conditions in ob associations compared to low - density t associations .",

    "<S> we present the results of a high - resolution imaging survey of 12 brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the closest ( @xmath0145 pc ) young ( @xmath05 myr ) ob association , upper scorpius . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained images with the advanced camera for surveys / high resolution camera on hst through the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) filters . </S>",
    "<S> this survey discovered three new binary systems , including one marginally resolved pair with a projected separation of only 4.9 au , resulting in an observed binary fraction of @xmath7 at separations @xmath84 au . after correcting for detection biases assuming a uniform distribution of mass ratios for @xmath9 , </S>",
    "<S> the estimated binary fraction is @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the binary fraction is consistent with that inferred for higher - mass stars in upper sco , but the separation and mass ratio distributions appear to be different . </S>",
    "<S> all three low - mass binary systems in upper sco are tight ( @xmath11 au ) and of similar mass ( @xmath12 ) , consistent with expectations based on previous multiplicity studies of brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the field and in open clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the implication is that the distinct separation and mass ratio distributions of low - mass systems are set in the formation process or at very young ages , rather than by dynamical disruption of wide systems at ages @xmath85 myr . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we combine the survey detection limits with the models of burrows et al . ( 1997 ) to show that there are no planets or very low - mass brown dwarfs with masses @xmath13 at projected separations @xmath14 au , or masses @xmath15 at projected separations @xmath16 au orbiting any of the low - mass ( 0.04 - 0.10 @xmath17 ) objects in our sample . </S>"
