    "the gamma  ray burst ( grb ) of 1997 february 28 is the first for which a fading x ",
    "ray source ( costa et al . 1997a ; costa et al .",
    "1997b ; yoshida et al . 1997 ) and an optical transient ( groot et al . 1997a ; van paradijs et al . 1997 ) have been reported .",
    "the position of the optical transient is consistent with that of an extended object which may be a galaxy ( groot et al .",
    "1997b ; sahu et al . 1997 ) , leading to the possibility that this may be the first observation of a counterpart to a classical grb .",
    "the probability that the grb , the fading x  ray source , the optical transient , and the extended source / galaxy are related is in part a function of the position and size of the grb error box . in this paper",
    ", we present the annulus of possible arrival directions derived by triangulation between the ulysses , bepposax , and wind spacecraft , as well as the error box formed by the intersection of the annulus with the independently determined bepposax burst positions .",
    "we also present the time history , peak flux , and fluence of this burst , and derive a lower limit to its distance based only on the curvature of the wavefront .",
    "grb 970228 was observed by the ulysses grb ( hurley et al .",
    "1992 ) , wind konus ( aptekar et al . 1995 ) , and bepposax wide field camera ( wfc : jager et al . , 1997 ) and gamma  ray burst monitor ( grbm : this is part of the phoswich detection system - see frontera et al . 1997a ; costa et al . 1997c ; pamini et al .",
    "1990 ) experiments .",
    "the ulysses and grbm light curves are shown in figure 1 .",
    "ulysses , in heliocentric orbit , was 1988 light - seconds from earth ; wind , at the first lagrange point , was 4.6 light - seconds from earth , and bepposax is in low earth orbit .",
    "for the purposes of grb triangulation , this means that the ulysses / sax and ulysses / wind baselines are practically identical ; the two independent annuli of burst positions are consistent with one another , but redundant .",
    "figure 2 shows the ulysses / sax grbm triangulation annulus , the sax wfc position ( costa et al . 1997d ; frontera et al .",
    "1997b ) , and the position of the fading x  ray source determined by the sax low and medium energy concentrator/ spectrometers ( lecs / mecs : boella et al . 1997",
    "; parmar et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the position of the extended source / fading optical source is also indicated .",
    "this annulus is consistent with , but smaller than those previously determined ( hurley et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b ; cline et al .",
    "table 1 gives the details of the ulysses / sax grbm and ulysses / wind konus annuli , and table 2 gives the intersection points between the ulysses / sax grbm annulus , and the sax wfc and lecs / mecs error circles .",
    "the region defined by the sax wfc error circle and the ulysses / sax annulus has an area of approximately 4 square arcminutes , or 0.14 times the area of the sax wfc error circle ; the region defined by the sax lecs / mecs error circle and the ulysses / sax annulus has an area of approximately 1.5 square arcminutes , or 0.67 times the area of the sax lecs / mecs error circle .",
    "the combination of the two error circles and the annulus defines a region with an area of approximately 0.76 square arcminutes .",
    "finally , the extended source possibly associated with the optical transient lies approximately 22.5 from the center line of the ulysses / sax annulus .",
    "when the distance of the extended source is eventually determined , the total energy and peak luminosity of this burst will be important parameters for any models .",
    "although the ulysses spectral memory triggered late in the burst and resulted in too few counts for an accurate determination of the energy spectrum , we can calculate the fluence and peak flux of this burst under the assumption of a power law spectrum with index -1.07 , which is consistent with the spectral data that we have . for convenience , we have extrapolated these numbers to an energy range , and have used time intervals , which allow a comparison with cataloged batse bursts ( meegan et al .",
    "the 25100 kev fluence was approximately @xmath2 .",
    "the 25100 kev peak fluxes were approximately @xmath3 over 0.0625 s and @xmath4 over 0.25 s.    more accurate spectral measurements were made by the konus experiments aboard both the wind and kosmos-2326 spacecraft over the 13 kev10 mev range . an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung fit ( kt=150 kev ) gives 25 - 100 kev fluences and peak fluxes @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the latter was derived by scaling the average spectrum over @xmath7 to the 16 ms resolution time history .",
    "the sax grbm recorded @xmath8 , 40100 kev , @xmath9 , 100700 kev , and a peak flux @xmath10 ( over 1 s , 40600 kev ) .",
    "virtually all distance estimates for grb s involve models of matter distribution ( e.g. in the oort cloud , the galactic halo , or at cosmological distances ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider model - independent distance limits .",
    "if we assume that some source within the annulus ( say the optical transient ) is associated with this grb , we can derive a distance lower limit from the wavefront curvature . to do this",
    ", we imagine that the source is at a very large distance from earth , along the earth  source vector , and allow the distance to decrease . for each value of the assumed distance",
    ", we calculate the difference in arrival times at the ulysses and sax satellites and compare this with the arrival time difference for a source at infinity ( i.e. a plane wave ) .",
    "when these two times differ by an amount which corresponds to the measured timing uncertainty in the comparison of the two time histories in figure 1 ( 300 ms ) , we have a source distance lower limit . in this case , that limit is @xmath111000 au or about 0.05 pc ; a refined analysis , currently in progress , may raise this limit .",
    "the ipn localization for grb970228 is consistent with the sax error circles and the position of the optical transient and extended source .",
    "sax wfc localizations of grbs provide a strong confirmation of ipn accuracies .",
    "consistency between ipn annuli and sax error circles are in effect a rigorous `` end  to  end '' test of the spacecraft timing and the software used to derive burst positions by triangulation . in the case of grb970228",
    ", this consistency demonstrates that ipn uncertainties can not exceed approximately @xmath11 , the radius of the wfc error circle .",
    "a similar result was obtained for grb 970111 ( hurley et al .",
    "1997c ) . assuming that the fading x  ray source is associated with the grb , the uncertainty becomes approximately @xmath12 , and further assuming that the optical transient is associated with the grb leads to a maximum uncertainty of approximately @xmath13 .",
