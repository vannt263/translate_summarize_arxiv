    "compact stars , exotic stars , wormholes and black holes are astrophysical objects described by the einstein s field equations . for a perfect fluid and in case of spherical symmetry , these objects obey the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation ( in c.g.s .",

    "the function @xmath7 is the quasi - local mass , and is denoted as the mass function .",
    "it is clear that the knowledge of @xmath4 allows to understand the astrophysical structure under examination .",
    "if we fix our attention on compact stars , ordinary general relativity offers two kind of exact solutions for the isotropic tov equation :    \\a ) the constant energy density solution ,    \\b ) the misner - zapolsky energy density solution@xcite    or the combination of a ) and b ) , namely the dev - gleiser energy density profile@xcite .",
    "since compact stars are usually macroscopic objects , the quantum gravity contribution is expected to become important when the inner core of the star is considered , where the highest pressures and densities are reached .",
    "an attempt to include quantum gravitational effects in compact stars , besides those that are consequences of the standard fermi degeneracy pressure , can be found in@xcite , where planck scale modifications of the energy / momentum dispersion relations have been taken into the account , and in @xcite , where the tov equation and the equation of state of zero temperature ultra - relativistic fermi gas based on generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) have been used to see the quantum gravitational effects on the cores of compact stars .",
    "gravity s rainbow offers another opportunity to probe quantum gravitational effects into the core of a compact star . for simplicity",
    "we will fix our attention only on the isotropic case .",
    "basically , gravity s rainbow is a distortion of space - time induced by two arbitrary functions , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which have the following property@xmath11 it has been introduced for the first time by magueijo and smolin@xcite , who proposed that the energy - momentum tensor and the einstein s field equations were modified with the introduction of a one parameter family of equations @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an energy dependent newton s constant and @xmath14 is an energy dependent cosmological constant , defined so that @xmath15 is the low - energy newton s constant and @xmath16 is the low - energy cosmological constant .",
    "for instance , the _ rainbow _ version of the schwarzschild line element is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the line element of the unit sphere .",
    "it is immediate to generalize the metric @xmath19 for any spherically symmetric spacetime@xmath20 where @xmath7 is the mass of the star inside the radius @xmath8 and @xmath21 is the redshift function .",
    "of course , the line element @xmath22 has consequences on eq.@xmath23 . to see what are these consequences",
    ", we consider the energy - momentum stress tensor describing a perfect - fluid of the form@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the four - velocity normalized in such a way that @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the unit spacelike vector in the radial direction , i.e. @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath4 is the energy density , @xmath5 is the radial pressure measured in the direction of @xmath30 , and @xmath6 is the transverse pressure measured in the orthogonal direction to @xmath30 . because of gravity s rainbow , the normalization of @xmath25 is modified and becomes@xmath31 and for @xmath30 , one gets@xmath32 fixing our attention on the isotropic case , the stress - energy tensor becomes@xmath33 t_{00 } & = \\frac{\\rho\\left ( r\\right ) c^{2}e^{2\\phi(r)}}{g_{1}^{2}(e / e_{\\mathrm{pl}})}c^{2}\\\\ t_{22 } & = \\frac{pr^{2}}{g_{2}^{2}(e / e_{\\mathrm{pl}})}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\hspace { 2cm}% \\begin{aligned}[l ] t_{11 } & = \\frac{p(r)}{g_{2}^{2}(e / e_{\\mathrm{pl}})\\left [ 1 - 2gm\\left ( r\\right ) /rc^{2}\\right ] } \\\\ t_{33 } & = \\frac{pr^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta}{g_{2}^{2}(e / e_{\\mathrm{pl}})}.\\label{stress } \\end{aligned}%\\ ] ] and the component of the einstein tensor @xmath34 reduces to@xmath35 with the help of the first component of the stress - energy tensor @xmath36 and eq.@xmath37 , we can write the first einstein s field equation , namely @xmath38 which assumes the form@xmath39 while for the second one , namely @xmath40 , we get@xmath41   } .\\label{eq : pot-1}%\\ ] ] it is important to say that the equilibrium equation @xmath42 is not affected by gravity s rainbow . from eq.@xmath43",

    "eq.@xmath47 represents the tov equation modified by gravity s rainbow .",
    "we will fix our attention on the constant energy density case and to the variable case of the misner - zapolsky type .",
    "the constant energy density case , represents the simplest case to consider . with this assumption ,",
    "equation @xmath47 becomes @xmath48   } , \\label{rtov2}%\\ ] ] while eq.@xmath49 can be easily solved to give @xmath50 where we have used the boundary condition @xmath51 .",
    "it is important to observe that the mass density is constant in @xmath8 , but it is not constant in @xmath52 .",
    "it is also important to observe that eqs.@xmath53 and @xmath54 work for the whole star included the external boundary @xmath55 , where we can assume that the effects of gravity s rainbow have vanished . to this purpose",
    ", we analyze the problem into two fundamental regions@xcite :    * the boundary @xmath56 , namely the boundary is very large compared to the size of the inner core . * the boundary @xmath57 , that it means that we are exploring the possibility of the existence of stars of planckian size .",
    "it is interesting to note that both cases respect the buchdahl - bondi bound which states that@xcite @xmath58    the case @xmath59 can be interpreted as a star forming close to the planck scale and stabilized by gravity s rainbow .",
    "this means that it is the distorted space - time which supports the existence of a star of planckian size .",
    "the variable energy density case is represented by the misner - zapolsky solution@xcite . to discuss the modification induced by gravity s rainbow",
    ", we consider a density energy profile of the following form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a constant with dimensions of an energy density divided by a ( length)@xmath62 with @xmath63 to be determined .",
    "solving eq.@xmath49 leads to @xmath64 plugging @xmath65 into eq.@xmath66 , one finds @xmath67   c^{2}% g_{2}^{2}(e / e_{\\mathrm{pl}})}\\nonumber\\\\ \\downarrow\\\\ \\alpha=-\\left (   \\frac{c^{2}+\\omega}{\\omega c^{2}}\\right )   \\frac{4\\pi gar^{2+\\alpha}\\left (   \\left (   3+\\alpha\\right )   \\omega+c^{2}\\right )   } { \\left [ c^{2}g_{2}^{2}(e / e_{\\mathrm{pl}})\\left (   3+\\alpha\\right )   -8\\pi gar^{2+\\alpha } \\right ]   } , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where we have used the following equation of state @xmath68 .",
    "it is immediate to see that @xmath69 , there is a singularity into the tov equation and a dependence on @xmath8 still persists .",
    "therefore fixing @xmath70 one gets the relationship @xmath71   } , \\label{omega}%\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath72 .",
    "we find an identity when @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , namely we get the ordinary gr solution of the undeformed tov equation .",
    "in particular for @xmath73 @xmath77 and @xmath78 we reproduce the misner - zapolsky solution . on the other hand ,",
    "when gravity s rainbow is switched on and @xmath79 , it is immediate to see that from eq.@xmath80 follows that @xmath81 is no longer a constant but it becomes a function of @xmath82 .",
    "in this work , we have considered the possibility that a compact star is affected by gravity s rainbow .",
    "since the action of gravity s rainbow is prevalently at planckian length scales , we find that in case of isotropic pressure and constant energy density , a star of planckian size if it is formed , and satisfies the usual buchdahl - bondi bound , is also stable . on the other hand ,",
    "when the variable energy density case is considered and an equation of state is introduced , one finds that , from the relation @xmath83 , @xmath81 becomes a function of @xmath82 , necessarily .",
    "it is interesting to note that the constant energy density and the misner - zapolsky energy density are two particular cases of the dev - gleiser potential which is of the form@xcite@xmath84 where @xmath85 is the parameter of the constant energy density case and @xmath72 .",
    "note that in both cases , namely the constant and variable energy density case , also the mass becomes a function of @xmath82 .",
    "here we have considered the simple case where @xmath82 is not dependent on the radius @xmath8 .",
    "of course , other than introducing an anisotropy , the case in which @xmath82 becomes @xmath86 will be a subject of a future investigation as well as the full examination of the dev - gleiser potential .",
