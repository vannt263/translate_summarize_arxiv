    ", we apply a cooling mechanism which is briefly described below .",
    "the frustration of a spin system can be characterized using a measure , known as the _ frustration degree _ ( @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "spin frustration is a classical concept ( i.e. , it is clearly defined for classical spin systems ) and thus connected to a classical limit of the quantum hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the characterization of frustration degree is based on performing a classical limit ( ising limit ) of the possible quantum system . for a quantum system with hamiltonian @xmath16 , a classical limit ,",
    "@xmath17 can be obtained by replacing the one - body , two - body , etc .",

    "it is evident that the positive terms contribute to frustration in the system by trying to increase the ground state energy , whereas the non - positive terms enable non - frustrated ground state configurations by attempting to lower the same ( see fig .",
    "[ nf1 ] for an illustration ) .",
    "hence , @xmath22 .",
    "the _ frustration degree _ of the spin system , with hamiltonian @xmath16 , can then be defined as @xmath23 where  avg \" denotes the average over all possible ground states , @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the frustration degree is the ratio of the positive value contributing ( frustrating ) terms and the non - positive value contributing ( non - frustrating ) terms , averaged over all possible ground state configurations .",
    "the value of @xmath15 ranges from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , and the higher the value of @xmath15 , stronger is the frustration in the system described by it . for non - frustrated systems ,",
    "the value of @xmath15 is zero as there is no positive value ( frustration ) contributing term in the hamiltonian for any ground state configuration ( see fig . [ nf1 ] ) .",
    "a typical aspect of frustrated systems is the highly degenerate ground state manifold . to investigate the entanglement properties of the system",
    ", we wish to probe its low - temperature states and to that end , we apply the prescription of a cooling mechanism to obtain a fixed _ cooled _ system state from the highly degenerate ground state space @xcite .",
    "the cooling method for a hamiltonian of @xmath5 quantum spin-@xmath26 particles can be enumerated in the following steps : 1 ) we consider the initial state to be a fully separable state of an @xmath5-qubit system , given by @xmath27 2 ) we project the initial product state @xmath28 onto the ground state manifold of the frustrated system under consideration . hence ,",
    "the final projected state reads @xmath27 where @xmath29 s are the degenerate ground state eigenstates of the frustrated system .",

    ", we define the ggm of the final state @xmath31 as @xmath32",
    "we consider the six prototype frustrated models .",
    "these prototypes are known to range from highly frustrated systems to ones with very low frustration .",
    "it is to be stressed here that the qualitative intensity of the frustration in these systems is independent of the parameter used to quantify frustration .",
    "the use of frustration degree is limited to establish a numerical value of the amount of frustration in these frustrated systems .",

    "we address the question whether multipartite entanglement can be a useful tool to study frustrated models .",
    "let us first consider the highly frustrated ising model with antiferromagnetic long range ( lr ) interactions  the ising gas model .",

    "it can be easily derived that the highest eigenvalue , for any @xmath57 bipartition , corresponds to @xmath63 , for @xmath62 even , and to @xmath64 , for @xmath62 odd .",

    "we observe that @xmath1 increases with increasing @xmath40 . for large system size , @xmath85 , and hence the ground state is maximally genuinely multipartite entangled for this maximally frustrated case .",
    "similar to the ising gas , another highly frustrated system with the same frustration ratio ( @xmath43 1 ) is the heisenberg antiferromagnet with long range interactions .",
