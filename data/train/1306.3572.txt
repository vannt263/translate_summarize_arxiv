    "much progress has been achieved in recent years in charting the abundance and integrated properties of the earliest galaxies beyond a redshift of @xmath6 selected via optical and near - infrared ( nir ) photometry ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the emerging picture indicates that the redshift period @xmath7 was a formative one in the assembly history of normal galaxies .",
    "sources at @xmath8 show moderately blue ultraviolet continua possibly consistent with young , metal - poor stellar populations with a star - formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath9 yr@xmath2 ( e.g. @xcite ) . their small physical sizes ( @xmath10 kpc ; @xcite ) and modest stellar masses ( @xmath11 ; @xcite ) suggest they quickly merge into larger , more luminous systems .",
    "the abundance of sub - luminous , small galaxies at high redshift also indicates significant merging occurred at early times , given the faint - end slope of the uv luminosity function changes from a steep @xmath12 at @xmath13 @xcite to @xmath14 at @xmath15 ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in practice",
    "it is hard to decipher the physical processes that govern the early assembly of galaxies from integrated properties alone .",
    "we therefore seek to complement statistical measures such as star formation rates and stellar masses by detailed evidence from well - studied individual examples .",
    "likewise , our understanding of early cosmic history may be incomplete given so much is currently deduced from optical and near - infrared data alone@xcite .",
    "although optical and near - infrared selected sources at high redshift suggest they contain little or no dust @xcite , this may be a selection bias .",
    "star formation obscured by dust can not be quantified without identifying cold dust emission .",
    "furthermore , the gas phase metallicity remains a key measurement for understanding early systems , most notably in locating the highly - prized pristine ` first generation ' systems unpolluted by supernova enrichment .",
    "neither optical nor near - infrared facilities can currently address this important quest given the diagnostic metal lines used at lower redshift , such as @xmath163726,3729   and @xmath165007,4959   , can not be measured beyond @xmath175 until the launch of the james web space telescope .",
    "it is for this reason that state of the art sub - millimeter facilities such as the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) offer enormous promise .",
    "first , they can quantify the possible bias in our current `` optical '' view of early galaxy formation by detecting the hidden cold dust in high redshift galaxies .",
    "secondly , the co/ 158@xmath18 m features prominent in star forming regions in the local universe offer a valuable tracer of metallicity at early times . thus far ,",
    "neither cold dust continuum nor these low - ionization tracers of metallicity have been observed beyond @xmath19 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although a few qsos have been observed at sub - mm wavelengths to @xmath20 @xcite , the presence of a powerful agn undoubtedly complicates any understanding of the physical conditions in their host galaxies .",
    "detecting these important diagnostic signals of dust and metallicity from typical @xmath21 galaxies is clearly a major observational challenge . only upper limits on and submm continuum fluxes have been presented so far for the abundant population of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and ly@xmath22 emitters ( laes ) at @xmath23 .",
    "these limits have come from deep exposures with the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba;@xcite ) facility on the james clerk maxwell telescope and plateau de bure interferometric observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "very recently , one @xmath24 source has been studied in this way following a comprehensive search for red objects in the herschel hermes blank field survey at @xmath25 m @xcite .",
    "this source , hfls3 , has a very strong far - infrared continuum emission and prominent molecular / low - ionization lines .",
    "its star formation rate , inferred from its far - infrared luminosity , is extremely high , @xmath26 yr@xmath2 .",
    "clearly we need to understand the context of this remarkable object by observing other sources at a similar redshift .",
    "the present work is concerned with undertaking such a study for an extraordinarily luminous star - forming galaxy which will hopefully complement the study of hfls3 by @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of the star - forming galaxy at @xmath27 , himiko , with a _",
    "spitzer_/irac counterpart .",
    "this source was identified from an extensive 1 deg@xmath28 optical survey for @xmath29 galaxies in the ukidss / uds field conducted with the subaru telescope . the redshift was subsequently confirmed spectroscopically using keck / deimos .",
    "the unique features of this remarkable source are evident in comparison to the total sample of 207 galaxies at @xmath29 found in the panoramic subaru survey . not only is himiko by far the most luminous example ( @xmath30 ; @xmath31 erg s@xmath2 ) , but it is spatially extended in ly@xmath22 emission",
    "whose largest isophotal area is 5.22 arcsec@xmath28 , corresponding to a linear extent of over 17 kpc .",
    "the lower limit , @xmath32yr@xmath2 , is placed on the sfr of himiko by the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting analysis with the early photometric measurements and the stellar - synthesis and nebular - emission models @xcite . due to the large uncertainties of photometric measurements ,",
    "@xcite can not constrain @xmath33 , and provide only the lower limit of sfr with @xmath34 .",
    "the present paper is concerned with the analysis of uniquely deep alma and _ hst _ observations of this remarkable source .",
    "given its intense luminosity and high star formation rate , the presumption is that it is being observed at a special time in its assembly history .",
    "we seek to use the cold dust continuum and measures from alma to understand its dust content and gas phase metallicity .",
    "likewise the matched resolution of _ hst _ will allow us to address its morphologic nature . by good fortune ,",
    "one of the _ hst _ intermediate band filters closely matches the intense lyman @xmath22 emission observed for this source with subaru .",
    "ultimately , we then seek to understand the physical source of energy that powers the extensive lyman @xmath22 nebula .",
    "a plan of the paper follows .",

    "to understand whether obscured star - formation is an important issue as well as the metallicity of himiko , a key source at high redshift , we carried out deep alma band 6 observations in 2012 july 15 , 18 , 28 , and 31 with 16 12m - antenna array under the the extended configuration of 36 - 400 m baseline .",
    "the precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) ranged from 0.7 to 1.6 mm during the observations .",

    "further details of the alma observations and sensitivities are summarized in table [ tab : alma_observations ] .",
    "we averaged fluxes over the two spectral windows of lsb ( 249.30 - 253.05 ghz or 1.203 - 1.185 mm ) and usb ( 264.96 - 268.71 ghz or 1.131 - 1.116 mm ) in the range of frequency free from the line .",

    "figure [ fig : betalya ] shows that the data points of himiko fall on the tracks of star - formation photoionization models @xcite within the measurement errors and the dust - extinction correction uncertainties , and indicates that ly@xmath22 emission of himiko can be explained by the photoionization by massive stars .",
    "we now bring together our key results , both from the earlier subaru program@xcite and the present _ hst _ and alma campaigns , in order to understand the significance of our upper limits on the [ c ii ] and dust emission and thereby the nature of himiko .      we have shown ( figure [ fig : himiko_sed ] ) that himiko s submm emission is comparable with or weaker than that of local dwarf irregulars with far lower star - formation rates , indicating intensive star - formation in a dust - poor gaseous environment .",

    "similarly , our strong upper limit on the @xmath4 m line ( figure [ fig : cii_sfr_himiko ] ) places it significantly below the scaling relation of @xmath5}$ ] and sfr obeyed by lower redshift galaxies .",
    "this discovery indicates the following four possibilities : himiko has a ) a hard ionizing spectrum from an agn , b ) a very high density of photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) , c ) a low metallicity , and d ) a large column density of dust . in the case of a ) ,",
    "a hard ionizing spectrum of agn can produce little luminosity relative to fir luminosity , due to the intense ionization field @xcite . as we discuss in ( ii ) of section 4.2 ,",
    "there are no signatures of agn ; no detections of x - ray and high - ionization lines as well as extended sources plus non - agn like ly@xmath22 profile+surface brightness .",
    "we can rule out the possibility of a ) . in the case of b ) , a very high density of pdrs gives more rapid collisional de - excitations for the forbidden line of , and quench a emission line . in the case of c ) , the pdrs in himiko are composed of metal poor gas that may be quite typical of normal galaxies observed at early epochs .",
    "@xcite has argued that offsets from the -sfr relation can be explained in terms of metal abundance and this would imply a gas - phase metallicity of @xmath276 .",
    "indeed , for our young mean stellar age of @xmath277 myr , standard ionization - photon bounded hii regions with a local chemical abundance would yield emission somewhat above the local scaling relation , due to the expected large pdrs .",
    "moreover , the recent numerical simulations predict that a flux drops as metallicity decreases @xcite .",
    "@xcite claim that himiko s gas - phase metallicity is sub - solar with their models and the previous iram upper limit .",
    "comparing these numerical models with our strong alma upper limit of would place further constraints on metallicity of himiko . in the case of d ) , the depth of c@xmath278 zones in pdrs is determined by dust extinction . since the c@xmath278 zones extend over the dust extinction up to @xmath279 @xcite , heavy dust extinction in ism does not allow to make a large c@xmath278 zones emitting .",
    "however , from no detection of 1.2 mm dust continuum discussed above , the heavy dust extinction narrowing the pdrs is unlikely .",
    "as dust extinction and gas phase metallicity generally correlate closely ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , the weak dust emission also suggests a very low metallicity gas .",
    "thus , the case of c ) is probably true , which contribute the weak emission .",
    "the case of b ) could also help weakening the emission .",
    "to summarize , faint and weak dust emission can be explained in a self - consistent manner with a very low metallicity gas and little dust in a near - primordial system .",
    "it is informative to compare the above conclusion with the only other well - studied galaxy at this redshift , hfls3 at @xmath272=6.34 @xcite , recognizing that both it and himiko were selected on the basis of their extreme properties .",
    "figure [ fig : cii_fir_himiko ] presents the ratio of to the fir luminosity as a function of fir luminosity .",
    "although himiko is significantly offset from the trend shown by agn and local starbursts , this is not the case for hfls3 .",
    "although @xcite claim that hfls3 is free from agn activities on the basis of the level of excitation for co and h@xmath280o , its small to @xmath211 ratio of @xmath5}/l_{\\rm fir}=5\\times 10^{-4}$ ] suggests otherwise @xcite . on the other hand , the recent study of @xcite finds that a luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) with compact star - forming regions show a smaller @xmath5}/l_{\\rm fir}$ ] value , and that a @xmath5}/l_{\\rm fir}$ ] value of pure star - forming lirg drops by an order of magnitude , from @xmath281 to @xmath282 .",
    "thus , there is another possibility that hfls3 could be a pure star - forming source more compact than those of local pure star - forming lirgs .      in considering the origin of himiko s extreme star formation rate and extensive ly@xmath22 halo ,",
    "it is convenient to return to the various explanations originally proposed by @xcite on the basis of the subaru , ukidss , and shallow _ spitzer _ data available at the time , taking into account the progress achieved with our new deep alma , _ hst _ , and _ spitzer _ data .    :",
    "@xcite discounted this possibility on the basis of the resolved kinematics of the extended @xmath283 halo . in section [ sec : hst_observations ] , we have strengthened the objections to this hypothesis since our _ hst _ data reveal three @xmath130 sources whose morphological asymmetries are not consistent with gravitational lensing .",
    "moreover , we can find no potential foreground lens in the vicinity of himiko @xcite .",
    "such a lens would have to be one of the three clumps revealed in the _ hst _ images , each of which has a @xmath284m - continuum break and blue uv continuum consistent with being physically associated at @xmath176.6 .",
    "our deep irac data also show no potential lensing sources near himiko , suggesting that there are no lensing objects with very red color , such as dusty starbursts at intermediate redshifts , invisible in the optical and nir bands .",
    "thus , we conclude that himiko is not a gravitational lensed system .    :    our _ hst _ images do not reveal any obvious point source that could represent an active nucleus ( figure [ fig : himikohstspitzersubaru_images ] ) .",
    "moreover , as noted by @xcite , himiko is undetected at x - ray wavelengths of @xmath285 kev down to @xmath286 erg s@xmath2 @xmath287 , and the keck optical spectrum does not reveal any high ionization features such as nv .",

    "2013 submitted to mnras ) .",
    "finally , radiative transfer simulations by @xcite show that the ly@xmath22 line profile and surface brightness of himiko is inconsistent with heating from either a compton - thick or compton - thin agn .",
    "thus , we conclude the ly@xmath22 halo is unlikely to be heated by an active galactic nucleus .    :    @xcite discussed the possibility that himiko could be a single virialized system .",
    "since the new _ hst _ data reveals three distinct uv luminous clumps each comparable to the characteristic luminosity @xmath130 , we consider that himiko is unlikely to be a single virialized system although there are many reports of disk galaxies with prominent clumps at @xmath289 ( e.g. @xcite ) , the absence of stellar disk ( figure [ fig : himikohstspitzersubaru_images ] ) distinguishes himiko from a single galaxy with clumpy structures such found at the lower redshifts .",

    ":    the extensive ly@xmath22 nebula may be powered by star formation itself , but the gas could also be shock heated by strong outflows driven by multiple supernova explosions in an intensive starburst @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : betalya ] shows the relation between the uv slope @xmath225 which characterizes the stellar population and the ly@xmath22 equivalent width @xmath129 .",
    "this shows that the photoionization models of @xcite whereby ly@xmath22 photons are scattered by the ism and circum - galactic medium ( cgm ) can explain the properties of himiko , notwithstanding the uncertainties in @xmath225 .",
    "the success of this model depends , of course , on the escape fraction of ionizing photons which should be moderately low ( @xmath30050% ) so that scattering is effective .",
    "however , the conclusion is robust even if we adopt a moderate dust extinction of @xmath301 ( section [ sec : stellar_population ] ) .",
    "thus , within the uncertainties , the amount of star formation observed is sufficient to power the extended ly@xmath22 nebula ; outflow and shocks are not required .",

    "<S> both aspects of our alma observations suggest himiko is an unique object with a very low dust content and perhaps nearly primordial interstellar gas . </S>",
    "<S> our _ hst _ images provide unique insight into the morphology of this remarkable source , highlighting an extremely blue core of activity and two less extreme associated clumps . </S>",
    "<S> himiko is undergoing a triple major merger event whose extensive ionized nebula of lyman alpha emitting gas , discovered in our earlier work with subaru , is powered by star formation and the dense circum - galactic gas . </S>",
    "<S> we are likely witnessing an early massive galaxy during a key period of its mass assembly close to the end of the reionization era . </S>"
