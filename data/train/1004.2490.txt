    "however in the presence of h@xmath1i outflows , the transmitted fraction of ly@xmath0 radiation through ionized gas can increase dramatically .",
    "this is because the outflowing h@xmath1i gas imparts a redshift to the ly@xmath0 photons that is well in excess of @xmath40 a few hundred km s@xmath12 ( see   [ sec : outflow ] and fig  [ fig : out ] ) . on the other hand ,",

    "* also see ouchi et al . in prep ) .",
    "the most important aspect of this observation is that the rest - frame uv luminosity function of these same galaxies does not evolve between these redshifts ( within the uncertainties , kashikawa et al .",

    "has a different impact on ly@xmath0 line and uv continuum photons .",
    "observations indicate the ly@xmath0 escape fraction decreases with the dust content of galaxies .",
    "more specifically , the mean ly@xmath0 equivalent width decreases with the observed reddening of lyman break galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite have used their models to quantify the actual escape fraction of ly@xmath0 photons from galaxies , @xmath128 , as a function of the observed dust reddening , and found that on average @xmath129 .",
    "@xcite recently argued that candidate galaxies at @xmath130 are considerably bluer than at lower redshifts .",
    "their most luminous candidates are consistent with e(b - v)@xmath131 , which translates to @xmath132 ( which is significantly higher than ly@xmath0 escape fraction inferred for galaxies at @xmath133 see e.g. hayes et al .",
    "2007,2010 ) .",
    "if we take this number literally , then our quoted ly@xmath0 fluxes are high by a factor of @xmath134 ( which implies that dust is not the dominant uncertainty ) . moreover , in hierarchical models of galaxy formation , we expect galaxies at higher redshifts , and lower luminosities to be less evolved , and hence the impact of dust is likely to be weaker .    the relation derived by @xcite was obtained by averaging over a dozen galaxies , and there exists considerable scatter around their derived relation .",
    "for example , observations of low - redshift star forming galaxies with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) revealed very weak ly@xmath0 emission ( or even strong absorption ) in metal poor objects @xcite , while strong ly@xmath0 emission could be detected from some metal and dust rich galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this scatter is likely related to the precise geometry of the dust distribution @xcite , viewing angle towards the galaxies @xcite , and outflows .",
    "when outflows are present in galaxies , the strength of ly@xmath0 emission appears to be independent of the dust content of the galaxy . in the absence of strong outflows",
    "however , ly@xmath0 line strength appears to decrease with dust content @xcite .",
    "our work implies that in high redshift galaxies , h@xmath1i outflows further affect the subsequent impact of the igm on the detectability of ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies .",
    "following the announcement of the discovery of a @xmath82 galaxy by @xcite  which was later disputed @xcite , @xcite argued that the line could be detected through a fully neutral igm , if the ly@xmath0 emitting region in the galaxy was receding relative to the surrounding absorbing igm with @xmath135 km s@xmath12 . in this study ,",
    "the galaxy ionized an h@xmath1ii region with a radius of @xmath136 pmpc .",
    "while peculiar velocities of this magnitude do not play an important role in reducing the gunn - peterson damping wing optical depth ( for which one needs @xmath137 km s@xmath12 , eq  [ eq : redgp ] ) , they can play a role in reducing the opacity of the ionized ` local ' igm ( see   [ sec : eor ] ) , just like outflows .",
    "however , both mechanisms are expected to leave different signatures on the observed ly@xmath0 line shape : scattering off hi outflows is expected to result in asymmetric emission lines ( see fig  [ fig : out ] ) , while peculiar velocities may leave an intrinsically symmetric emission line symmetric @xcite .",
    "we caution that symmetric ly@xmath0 emission lines may be observed as a result of scattering through a static ism ( see fig  [ fig : static ] ) , but point out that in the latter case the ly@xmath0 peak flux density is redshifted by @xmath138 km s@xmath12 relative to the galaxy s systemic redshift .",
    "this shift is much larger than that expected for the model that uses peculiar velocities , which is @xmath139 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the model used to generate ly@xmath0 line profiles in this paper assumes a single , thin , compact , spherical shell of hi gas surrounding the ly@xmath0 source ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite described an alternative simple outflow model that folds in constraints from observed profiles of interstellar metal absorption lines .",
    "this model can also reproduce observed ly@xmath0 line shapes in lbgs . in this model",
    ", the outflow can extend out to @xmath140 kpc , and outflow velocity increases with radius .",
    "it is not clear whether the models are incompatible : one can imagine the outflow extends over a wide range of velocities and spatial scales , but that the outflow s opacity to ly@xmath0 photons is dominated by gas closer to the galaxy that is restricted to a narrower range of velocities . as a result",
    ", it is possible to model the impact of the outflow on the ly@xmath0 radiation field as a single shell that has a low velocity dispersion .",
    "this is clearly an issue that needs further investigation .",
    "however , a more detailed investigation is beyond the scope of the present paper , especially because our main results are not likely sensitive to the precise model that one uses to describe the impact of the outflow on the ly@xmath0 radiation field .    in detail , the directly transmitted fraction of ly@xmath0 photons through the igm at the highest redshifts ( the ` first ' galaxies at @xmath141 ) probably depends quantitatively on the precise outflow model that one uses , since different models may imply different predicted redshift evolution .",
    "for example , in the models of @xcite and @xcite the emission in the red wing of the line ( at @xmath142 km s@xmath12 ) comes from ly@xmath0 photons that scatter back and forth repeatedly between the expanding hi outflow . in the model of @xcite this frequency ` diffusion ' does not occur , and the emission in the red wing of the line reflects the maximum velocity in the outflow . in this latter model ,",
    "the flux in the red wing of the line is suppressed at @xmath141 if the outflow velocities are much lower at high redshift ( see the end of   [ sec : outflow ] ) . on the other hand , it is difficult to completely suppress frequency diffusion .",
    "significant frequency diffusion occurs even in clumpy outflows with a covering factor of only @xmath143 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig  19 ) , which is less than the outflow covering factor inferred by @xcite over a significant range of radii .",
    "we therefore expect that photons likely emerge at @xmath137 km s@xmath12 from the ` first ' galaxies in both models , but that the fraction of the flux that emerges at these frequencies  and therefore @xmath65depends on the detailed properties of the hi in outflows in galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "this underlines one of our conclusions presented in   [ sec : conc ] ( also see   [ sec : eor ] ) , that it is crucial to understand the gas kinematics in the ism ( and/or circumgalactic medium ) of high - redshift galaxies in order to infer the properties of the igm from the observed ly@xmath0 flux .",
    "our main results regarding galaxies during the later stages of  and after  reionization ( @xmath144 ) require less ( or no ) extrapolation to higher redshifts , and practically do not depend at all on the precise underlying model of the ly@xmath0 line shape .",
    "instead these results rely only on the fact that the _ observed _ ly@xmath0 line shape can extend to frequencies that lie well beyond @xmath145 km s@xmath12 out to @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that radiation pressure on dust grains  which in turn are coupled to the interstellar gas provide an important source of pressure in the ism of galaxies , and that the observed outflows in galaxies are driven predominantly by radiation pressure ( see e.g. murray et al .",
    "given that the highest redshift galaxies likely contained little dust ( see   [ sec : dust ] ) , radiation pressure may be less important in these galaxies , and outflows could be weakened significantly .",
    "interestingly , especially in these first galaxies , a significant fraction ( @xmath147 ) of the total bolometric luminosity of the galaxy is ly@xmath0 line radiation .",
    "if this radiation is ` trapped ' by a large column of h@xmath1i gas , then the radiation pressure exerted by this ly@xmath0 radiation itself becomes important in driving the h@xmath1i gas out @xcite , thereby enhancing the detectability of the ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "the next generation of telescopes aim to directly observe the first generation of galaxies that initiated the reionization of our universe . the ly@xmath0 emission line is robustly predicted to be the most prominent intrinsic spectral feature of these galaxies . in this paper we investigated the prospects for detecting this ly@xmath0 emission , taking account of radiative transfer effects that are likely to occur in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of these galaxies",
    ".    observed interstellar metal absorption lines ( si@xmath1ii , o@xmath1i , c@xmath1ii , fe@xmath1ii and al@xmath1ii ) in lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) are typically strongly redshifted relative to the galaxies systemic velocity ( with a median off - set of @xmath11 km s@xmath12 ) , while the ly@xmath0 emission line is strongly redshifted ( with a median velocity offset of @xmath13 km s@xmath12 * ? ? ? * also see shapley et al .",
    "this suggest that large scale outflows are ubiquitous in lbgs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , scattering of ly@xmath0 photons by h@xmath1i in outflows has successfully explained the observed ly@xmath0 line shapes in ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies at @xmath14 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "scattering off outflows of interstellar h@xmath1i gas can shift ly@xmath0 photons to the red side of the line before it reaches the igm ( fig  [ fig : out ] ) . at these frequencies the gunn - peterson optical depth",
    "may be reduced to order unity as a result .    in this paper",
    "we investigated the detectability of ly@xmath0 radiation under the assumption that the outflows observed at low redshift also occur in the highest redshift galaxies .",
    "we found that outflows may cause as much as @xmath2 of the emitted ly@xmath0 radiation to be transmitted directly to the observer , even through a fully neutral igm (   [ sec : outflow ] ) . since the intrinsic ( restframe ) equivalent width of the ly@xmath0 line can be as high as ew@xmath148 for the first generation of galaxies , the observed ew@xmath149ew@xmath150  .",
    "for comparison , only @xmath151 of the @xmath89 lbg population have larger ews @xcite .",
    "we showed that for @xmath152 it may be easier to detect ly@xmath0 line emission with nirspec on the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( jwst ) , than continuum radiation with jwst s nircam in the same integration time .",
    "we also note that the next generation of ground - based 30-m telescopes with diffraction limited ao are expected to be more ( less ) sensitive than jwst at @xmath153 m for @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) spectroscopy ( see mountain et al .",
    "2009 , their fig  2 ) .",
    "that is , ground based high - resolution spectroscopic searches for high redshift galaxies can detect fainter galaxies at a fixed integration time when @xmath156 .",
    "such searches can therefore be competitive with searches that employ the drop - out technique .",
    "irrespective of the survey strategy that is used to search for the highest redshift galaxies , the prospect that ly@xmath0 can provide galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts is promising , and important as no robust predictions exists for the detectability of other emission lines (   [ sec : lines ] ) .",
    "this paper has focused on the first generation of galaxies that were surrounded by a neutral igm , but our work also applies more broadly .",
    "for example we argued in ",
    "[ sec : eor ] that h@xmath1i outflows promote the detectability of the ly@xmath0 emission line during later stages of reionization when much of the absorption is resonant absorption in a highly ionized hii region . as a result outflows can reduce the minimum h@xmath1ii bubble size that is required to render laes ` visible '",
    "this is illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "similarly , h@xmath1i outflows also promote the detectability of the ly@xmath0 emission line after reionization has been completed sources can introduce a unique anisotropy in the two - point correlation function of laes at @xmath119 .",
    "@xcite argued that this scattering  induced signature is reduced when the intrinsic ( i.e. prior to scattering ) ly@xmath0 line width is enhanced .",
    "winds are therefore also expected to reduce this clustering signature .",
    "that is , the clustering of laes post - reionization can provide constraints on the importance of winds in shaping the ly@xmath0 line shape . ] (   [ sec : eor ] ) .    in summary , radiative transfer effects in the ism of high redshift galaxies",
    "have been shown to broaden , and  in the case of outflows  redshift the emergent ly@xmath0 flux to a level that allows @xmath157 or more of the photons to escape absorption by the neutral igm .",
    "coupled with the large intrinsic ly@xmath0 line ew of the first generation of galaxies , we have shown that searches for galaxies in their redshifted ly@xmath0 emission line can be competitive with the drop - out technique out to the highest redshifts that can be probed observationally in the jwst era .",
