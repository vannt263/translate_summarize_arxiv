    "the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) is widely used to study the effect of disorder in crystals ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the cpa was initially developed independently by soven @xcite and taylor @xcite to study systems with only _ diagonal _ disorder . using a @xmath0 formulation , a generalization to the presence of _ off - diagonal _",
    "disorder was provided by blackmann esterling and berck ( beb ) @xcite . in these approaches",
    "the main idea is to replace the system by an effective medium which is determined by the condition that the averaged t - matrix of a single impurity immersed in the effective medium is zero .",
    "an alternative approach is based on cumulant expansion @xcite .",
    "this latter method has the advantage that it can handle the _",
    "environmental _ disorder term which is characteristic of the goldstone s systems ( phonons , magnons ) .",
    "the first proper treatment of the environmental disorder term , by using the cumulant expansion method is due to lage and stinchcombe @xcite who studied the diluted ising problem ( s=1/2 ) .",
    "later , using the 2x2 matrix method of beb , the method was extended by whitelaw @xcite to the phonon problem . in their calculations",
    "the coupling and locator are fixed quantities and restricted to nearest neighbor exchange couplings .",
    "it is well known that magnetism in clean ferromagnetic systems can be tackled with green s function formalism using tyablicov decoupling procedure ( rpa ) .",
    "this method goes beyond a simple mean field since it includes quantum fluctuations .",
    "additionally , it fulfills the goldstone and mermin - wagner theorems which is not the case of a mean field treatment . in the case of clean systems , combining first principle calculations to evaluate the exchange integrals and rpa method it was shown that one can provide satisfactory curie temperature for co and fe @xcite .",
    "whilst , a simple mean field calculation largely overestimate the curie temperature .",
    "it is our objective to provide in this paper a generalization of the rpa method to the disordered systems .",
    "we show that by combining in a self - consistent manner the rpa method and the cpa treatment of the disorder we are able to calculate curie temperature , magnetization of the different constituants , spectral weights .... the cpa treatment is done in a similar way as done by lage and stinchcombe and by whitelaw .",
    "however , due to tyablicov decoupling scheme for the disordered green s functions , the locators and the effective exchange integrals are temperature dependent and have to be determined self - consistently for a given temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first section",
    "we derive after tyablicov decoupling scheme the disordered binary alloy green s function which includes _ diagonal _ , _ off - diagonal _ and _ environmental _ disorder . in section",
    "ii , we perform the calculation of the averaged green s functions for a ( respectively b ) atom . in section iii , by generalizing callen s formula",
    "we derive the equations for the magnetizations @xmath1 , @xmath2 and for the curie temperature . in section iv",
    ", we propose an alternative simplified treatment of the p , d, .. scattering contribution to the self - energy to the case of system with long - range exchange coupling . finally in section",
    "v we present some numerical results and proceed to a test of our approximation of the self - energy contribution of the higher scattering terms .",
    "we study the magnetism in a binary alloy @xmath3 , a and b can be either magnetic ions or paramagnetic .",

    "the exchange integrals are assumed to be long range , our study is not restricted to the nearest neighbor heisenberg model . the second term which describes anisotropy is only relevant in the case of 2d systems to get a non zero curie temperature @xmath14 ( mermin - wagner theorem ) .",
    "however in the case of 3d systems the contribution of this term can be neglected .",

    "however , one should stress that the beb formalism does not apply when the environmental term is present .",
    "note also that in our model the locator @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are all temperature dependent , thus cpa and rpa loops have to be treated simultaneously in a self - consistent manner .",

    "indeed all the terms of the serie involving at least one factor @xmath111 reduces to zero . thus the end correction term does not explicitely depend on the environmental disorder term .",

    "the evaluation of the second term @xmath142 is much more complicated .",

    "it is also important to stress that at the lowest order the self - consistency for @xmath160 is not required .",
    "most of the ferromagnetic materials are of itinerant type , which means that the exchange integrals between different localized magnetic ions are long range and driven by the polarization of the conduction electrons gas as it is for the rkky mechanism @xcite . analytically , the generalization of the previous calculations to the more interesting case where @xmath7 are long ranged is not an easy task .",
    "however by truncating the serie , the summation can be performed numerically .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath142 is ( i ) proportional to @xmath39 which means that it originates only from the environmental disorder term and ( ii ) each term of the serie vanishes in the long wave length limit @xmath161 .",

    "thus the long wave length magnons are always treated properly .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath142 corresponds to higher order scattering terms ( p , d , f , ... ) it is natural to expect that these terms should not affect the curie temperature in a dramatic way . in other words",
    "we expect that a truncation of @xmath142 serie to the first few term should already provide a good approximation of curie temperature compared to the one one would get with the complete series",
    ". however , it is crucial to consider at least the lowest order term ( the virtual crystal contribution ) otherwise even in the clean limit one would not recover the correct result and the goldstone s theorem would be violated .",
    "if we consider the lower approximation @xmath162 , we get the expected results in the limit @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "it is not a priori clear whether such an approximation of @xmath142 to the lowest order provides satisfying results for the curie temperature at moderate impurity concentration .",
    "such an approximation will be tested later on .    to conclude this section",

    "<S> we present a theory based on green s function formalism to study magnetism in disordered heisenberg systems with long range exchange integrals . </S>",
    "<S> disordered green s function are decoupled within tyablicov scheme and solved with a cpa method . </S>",
    "<S> the cpa method is the extension of blackmann - esterling - beck approach to system with environmental disorder term which uses cumulant summation of the single - site non crossing diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial point is that we are able to treat simultaneously and self - consistently the rpa and cpa loops . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the summation of s - scattering contribution can always be performed analytically . while the p , d , f .. contributions are difficult to handle in the case of long - range coupling . to overcome this difficulty we propose and provide a test of a simplified treatment of these terms . in the case of 3d </S>",
    "<S> disordered nearest - neighbor heisenberg system , a good agreement between the simplified treatment and the full calculation is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> our theory allows in particular to calculate the curie temperature , the spectral functions and the temperature dependence of the magnetization of each constituant as a function of concentration of impurity . </S>",
    "<S> additionally it is shown that a virtual crystal treatment fails even at low impurity concentration .    </S>",
