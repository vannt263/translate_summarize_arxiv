    "based on the timing and spectral properties , six of the persistently bright neutron - star ( ns ) low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) were classified more than two decades ago as z sources , named after the spectral evolution patterns they trace out in x - ray color - color diagrams ( cds ) or hardness - intensity diagrams ( hids ; * ? ? ?",

    "the upper , diagonal and lower branches of their z - shaped tracks are called horizontal , normal , and flaring branches ( hb / nb / fb ) , respectively .",
    "based on the shape and orientation of the z tracks , these z sources were further divided into two subgroups , with the first three called `` sco - like '' z sources and the latter three called `` cyg - like '' @xcite .",
    "the sco - like z sources have a more vertically oriented hb and a stronger fb than the cyg - like types .",
    "the z tracks themselves can also move and change shapes in the cds / hids ( secular changes ) , most substantially in the case of .    recently , became the first x - ray transient identified as a z - source , and studies of this source have significantly improved our understanding of the spectral evolution in z sources and their relation to atoll sources , another subclass of ns lmxbs with lower x - ray luminosity ( @xmath5 ) than z sources .",

    "all three z branches were present when the source was bright . during the decay , the hb , nb , and fb successively disappeared , and the lower vertex finally transitioned into the atoll soft state .    using an x - ray spectral model that was successfully applied to two atoll transients @xcite ,",
    "lrh09 showed that it is most likely the mass accretion rate ( @xmath1 ) into the disk that drives the secular changes of z tracks and the transitions from z to atoll types .",
    "while the inner disk radius remained constant in the soft state of the atoll stage from the same spectral model , the inner disk radius in the z stage increased with luminosity , which was interpreted as an effect of the local eddington limit . on the other hand , the motion along a z branch on short timescales appeared to operate at roughly constant @xmath1 , at least for sco - like z tracks ( lrh09 ) .",
    "furthermore , the three z branches were linked to different mechanisms by lrh09 .",
    "the source ascends the hb as comptonization of the disk emission increases .",
    "the apparent luminosity of the boundary layer increases along the nb from the lower to the upper vertices , which can be explained as a transition from a geometrically thin disk to a thick disk that is expected to admit an advective component of mass flow to the ns .",
    "the fb is traced out as the inner disk radius temporarily decreases toward the value seen in the atoll soft state , presumably the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .    in this work",

    "[ sec : reduction ] we analyzed 68  observations of  made between utc 1999 october 3.112.3 ( i.e. , mjd 51454.151463.3 ) , using the same standard criteria to filter the data ( e.g. , removal of five type i x - ray bursts ) as described in @xcite .",
    "ftools 6.9 was used .",
    "the source can move on timescales as short as minutes in the cd / hid , especially on the fb . to track the evolution along the z track but also to gain enough statistics for spectral modeling and timing analysis ,",
    "data are normally split into short exposures and then rebinned based on their positions in the cd / hid ( e.g. , lrh09 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also followed this procedure here .",
    "we calculated x - ray colors using the proportional counter unit ( pcu ) 2 of the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the same way as described in @xcite .",
    "the soft color ( sc ) and the hard color ( hc ) are defined as the ratios of the crab - nebula - normalized count rates in the ( 3.65.0)/(2.23.6 ) kev bands and the ( 8.618.0)/(5.08.6 ) kev bands , respectively .",
    "we used spectra with exposures of 32  s from the `` standard 2 '' data to calculate the colors and construct the cd and hid , which are shown in the upper panels of figure  [ fig : cd ] .",
    "the hb , nb , and fb are denoted by the blue square , green triangle , and red cross symbols , respectively , and this convention is used for all other figures in this paper .    only a single z track is seen in these diagrams .",
    "the lower parts of the nb and fb have substantial overlap . from the 2.23.6 kev and 8.618.0 kev light curves in figure  [ fig : lc ]",
    ", we see that the source experienced frequent flares between mjd 51461.2 and 51463.3 .",
    "we identified the data within this interval as the fb , as supported by their positions in the cd and hid in figure  [ fig : cd ] .",
    "the transition from the hb to the nb is quite smooth .",
    "their boundary is defined to be @xmath8 ( strictly @xmath9 , see below ) .",
    "we note that the branches are hard to separate completely and that the above identification is approximate .",
    "the data points are often assigned a rank number @xmath10 to track their positions along the z track @xcite .",
    "this can be done by creating splines along the z track .",
    "considering that the scattering is large in the cd ( mostly due to large statistical uncertainties of scs ) , we created the splines in the hid , which are shown in the top right panel of figure  [ fig : cd ] . due to large overlap of lower parts of the fb and the nb",
    ", we created a spline for the fb ( the fb spline ) and another one for the hb and nb ( the hb+nb spline ) .",
    "we picked the normal points of the splines by hand , with one of them shared by the two splines .",
    "the @xmath10 value of this common normal point is set to be 2.0 ( the lower vertex ) , while the point with hc=0.45 in the hb+nb spline has @xmath11 ( defined as the upper vertex and the boundary the hb and nb ) .",
    "@xmath10 values at other positions in the splines are determined based on their distances to these two points along the splines .",
    "considering the different units of hc and intensity , we divide them by a characteristic number before calculating the distances , 0.45 for the hc and 2000 cts / s / pcu for the intensity .",
    "finally , the values of @xmath10 for data points on the fb and on the hb and nb are obtained by projecting them onto the fb and the hb+nb splines , respectively .",
    "we note that in @xcite a single spline was used and was applied in the cd .",
    "this is due to wider energy bands that they used to define the scs .",
    "we chose to keep our definition of colors as adopted in @xcite and lrh09 for easy comparison with these studies .",
    "we then combined 32 s spectra from pcu 2 based on selections in @xmath10 to create spectra with longer exposures for our spectral fits .",
    "the ranges of @xmath10 and the exposures for these @xmath12-resolved spectra are given in tables  [ tbl - fitparmod1][tbl - fitparmod2 ] .",
    "their locations in the cd and hid are shown in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : cd ] .",
    "we also created spectra of pcu 0 and those of the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which match the spectra of pcu 2 in time .",
    "pcus 0 and 2 were the only units that were operating during all of our observations .",
    "for the hexte , we used both clusters a and b. we applied dead time corrections to both the pca and hexte data .",
    "we also created power density spectra ( pds ) , which match the @xmath12-resolved spectra in time , to search for the khz qpos and hbos and study their relations with our spectral fit parameters . as we used a different way of data reduction from @xcite , our pds",
    "do not match theirs in time .",
    "we used the pca event files to create 5.840 kev light curves ( from all available pcus ) in a time bin of @xmath13 s. we then calculated @xmath10-resolved pds by averaging the individual pds computed for the appropriate set of 32-s time intervals .",
    "we excluded events below 5.8 kev to increase the detection significance of qpos , as in @xcite .",
    "we refer to their paper for more information on the data modes of the event files .",
    "we then fitted the pds in a very similar way as @xcite to search for khz qpos and hbos .",
    "basically the 200 - 2048 hz pds were fitted with one or two lorentzians for the khz qpos plus a dead - time - modified poisson level , and the 0.03125256 hz pds were fitted with a pl , a cutoff pl ( cpl ) and/or a lorentzian for various broad noise components and lorentzians for qpos , including hbos , plus a constant for the poisson level .",
    "we also calculated the rms within the 0.110 hz frequency band from these pds , in order to study its correlation with the comptonization fraction inferred from the spectral parameters .",
    "as the pca does not cover the low energy band below 2.5 kev and has only a modest energy resolution , we also analyzed two _ suzaku _ observations ( sequence numbers 402050010 and 402050020 ) , using the same data reduction procedure as in @xcite , to help to estimate the absorption and the fe line energy for our spectral fits to the _ rxte _ data .",

    "[ fig : comdelchi ] ]    the @xmath10-resolved pca ( pcu0 and pcu2 ) and hexte ( clusters a and b ) spectra were fitted jointly , with their relative normalizations allowed to float .",
    "we used the energy range 2.940.0 kev for the pca spectra and 20.060.0 kev for the hexte spectra .",
    "we assumed a model systematic error of 0.5% , as recommended by the pca team .",
    "both pca and hexte data were binned to have at least 40 counts per bin .",
    "all error bars of spectral fit results quoted are at a 90%-confidence level , unless indicated otherwise .",
    "we fitted the spectra with a model consisting of a bb ( _ bbodyrad _ in xspec ) , used to describe the boundary layer , a multicolor disk blackbody ( mcd ; _ diskbb _ in xspec ) , and a weak comptonized component .",
    "it also includes a fe k gaussian line , a fe k absorption edge , and an interstellar medium absorption , described by the _ gaussian _ , _ edge _ , and _ wabs _ models in xspec , respectively .",
    "the absorption edge was included in @xcite in their fits to the _ bepposax _ spectra , and we found that including it in our model also improved our fits significantly ( @xmath15 decreases by about 37 on average for each @xmath12-resolved spectrum , with 130 degrees of freedom typically ) . to reduce the scattering of our results , we used fixed values of the hydrogen column density @xmath16@xmath17 @xmath18 , the gaussian line central energy @xmath19 kev , and the edge energy @xmath20 kev ( derived below and at the end of this section ) for all fits .",
    "we explored several descriptions of the comptonized component .",
    "it is significant on the hb , and understanding this component is important toward our understanding of the hb , the hbos , and the khz qpos .",
    "the use of three spectral components to fit x - ray spectra of accreting nss in the soft state must be done carefully ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the comptonized and the thermal components can become degenerate when the comptonized component is steep ( e.g. , the photon index larger than 2.5 when the comptonization is modeled as a pl ) . here , we first used a cpl ( _ cutoffpl _ in xspec ) to describe the comptonized component .",
    "the whole model is @xmath21 using the xspec terminology , and this is our first model ( model  1 , or model mcd+bb+cpl , hereafter ) . using this model ,",
    "the comptonized component turned out to be weak compared with the thermal components except at the top of the hb .",
    "the photon index @xmath22 and the e - folding energy @xmath23 were generally not well constrained from the fits , and they showed no clear sign of variation along the z track . to have a better constrained estimate of them , we fitted all the hb spectra simultaneously with these two parameters tied to be the same and obtained @xmath24@xmath250.14 and @xmath26@xmath251.0 kev .",
    "these values were fixed in the final fits to all spectra .",
    "we then obtained @xmath27 kev from the simultaneous fit to the spectra from all branches .",
    "although fits with the comptonized component described by a pl can also have the @xmath14 values around one , such fits have systematic residuals above 20 kev on the hb ( figure  [ fig : comdelchi ] ) , which are significantly reduced using a cpl .",
    "the @xmath15 decrease is 51.7 , from 173.5 ( d.o.f=153 ) to 121.8 , for the @xmath10=0.320.40 spectrum . applying the posterior predictive @xmath28-value method @xcite to this spectrum",
    ", we found that the reduction of @xmath15 from the introduction of @xmath23 is less than 15 for all @xmath29 spectra that we simulated .",
    "thus the exponential rollover is required for the comptonized component at a confidence level above 99.99% ( at least for the @xmath10=0.320.40 spectrum ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ufspredm1 ] shows the unfolded spectra and fit residuals at four representative positions of the z track ( the top of the hb , the upper vertex , the lower vertex , and the top of the fb ) using model  1 .",
    "next , we attempted to describe the comptonization in a self - consistent way . considering that the cpl luminosity variation along the hb is strongly anti -",
    "correlated with the disk luminosity from model  1 ( section  [ sec : res ] ) , we assumed the scenario that there is a corona above the disk so that some photons from the thermal disk emission are scattered by the hot electrons in it and turned into comptonization emission .",
    "such a picture has been suggested in some studies of black hole x - ray binaries and can be modeled with the simpl model ( in xspec , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simpl is an empirical convolution model of comptonization in which a fraction of the photons from an input seed spectrum are scattered into a power - law component with the rest unscattered and observed directly .",
    "while applying the simpl model with the mcd as the input seed spectrum to our spectra at the top of the hb where the comptonization is the strongest , we found some systematic fit residuals above 20 kev , with the data falling below the model prediction at high energies ( similar to case a in figure  [ fig : comdelchi ] using a pl to describe the comptonization ) .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that there is a high - energy cut - off in the comptonization emission ( i.e. , the corona temperature is close to or within the energy range of our data ) , which was not included in the simpl model for simplicity @xcite . to account for this , one option is to modify the simpl model to include a high - energy cut - off for the comptonized component by multiplying it by , e.g. , the _ highecut _ model in xspec .",
    "an alternative option is to replace simpl with a comptonization model with the corona temperature as a parameter , such as the nthcomp model ( in xspec , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nthcomp model approximates the comptonization by solving the kompaneets equation with a relativistic correction to energy transfer between photons and electrons .",
    "the input seed photons can be a bb or a mcd in spectral shape , and we assumed the latter throughout the paper .",
    "the key parameters of this model include the asymptotic power - law photon index @xmath30 , the corona electron temperature @xmath31 , the seed photon temperature , and the normalization @xmath32 .    in this paper , we present the results with the comptonized component modeled with nthcomp .",
    "we note that similar conclusions can also be drawn using the simpl model modified to include the high - energy cut - off .",
    "then our second model ( model  2 or model mcd+bb+nthcomp , hereafter ) is : @xmath33 , with the seed photon temperature tied to the temperature of the mcd component @xmath34 . with model  2 ,",
    "our aim is to take into account the photons compton scattered so as to track the behavior of the thermal disk emission prior to compton scattering ( denoted as mcdps hereafter ) , as done in simpl .",
    "therefore , we calculated the photon flux of the mcdps by adding the photon flux of nthcomp ( the scattered part of the mcdps ) to that of the mcd component ( the unscattered part ) and then obtained the corresponding energy flux and normalization of the mcdps by increasing those of the mcd component proportionally to the photon flux ( the mcdps temperature @xmath35 is the same as @xmath34 ) .    to have a better constrained estimate of the parameters of the comptonized component , we fitted the hb spectra simultaneously with their @xmath30 and @xmath36 tied to be the same , as we did for model  1 .",
    "we found that comparably good fits can be obtained using a large range of @xmath30 , i.e. , 2.02.7 , with @xmath36 of 5.67.3 kev correspondingly .",
    "this uncertainty is coupled to the uncertainty in the fraction of the thermal disk emission scattered into the comptonization emission , with a larger scattering fraction inferred using a larger value of @xmath30 .",
    "however , the parameters ( the temperature and the normalization ) of the mcdps and the bb are much less affected .",
    "allowing a high value of @xmath37 might have the risk of large interference between the thermal ( especially the disk ) and the comptonized components , as similarly observed in the fits to atoll - source x - ray spectra in @xcite .",
    "in the end , we chose to present results using @xmath38 .",
    "then the fit to all the hb spectra simultaneously gave @xmath39 .",
    "the above values of @xmath30 and @xmath36 were fixed in the final fits to all spectra .",
    "sample fits with model  2 are given in figure  [ fig : ufspredm2 ] .",
    "the systematic effect of our choice of @xmath30 will be discussed later by comparing with results using other values of @xmath30 in the range of 2.02.7 .",
    "we estimated @xmath40 and @xmath41 with the two _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "the energy bands and the data binning method used were the same as in @xcite .",
    "we applied model  1 ( model  2 gives very similar results ) and fitted both _",
    "observations simultaneously with @xmath40 and @xmath41 tied to be the same for both observations . only a very weak cpl is needed in both observations .",
    "the absorption edge can not be constrained by the data , probably because of the gap between the xis and pin ( 1011 kev ) and the relatively poor data quality around this edge .",
    "we still included it in the fit but fixed @xmath20 kev ( see above ) .",

    "the source climbs up the hb due to the increasing portion of the thermal disk emission compton scattered .",
    "the excursion from the lower to the upper vertices on the nb corresponds to the transition from a slim - disk accretion @xcite to a standard - thin - disk accretion @xcite . at the lower vertex",
    ", the disk is truncated at a radius outside the isco as the local eddington limit is reached at the inner disk radius ( see discussion below ) .",
    "the source climbs up the fb due to the temporarily fast decrease of the inner disk radius toward the isco . since the source evolved slower and stayed longer in the two vertices than in other parts of z tracks ( at least on the nb and fb ) , the above three processes could correspond to three kinds of instability ( lrh09 ) .",
    "the slim disk solution was associated with the upper vertex because it can provide more mass inflow onto the ns surface than the standard thin disk and can explain the increase of the bb apparent area from the lower to the upper vertices .",
    "the disk emission was not observed to change significantly during such a transition ( in the sco - like tracks ) , probably because the slim disk emission differs from the standard disk significantly only at accretion rates much higher than the eddington limit @xcite .    as a similar spectral evolution",
    "is observed in , the above picture can be applied to this system and is sketched in figure  [ fig : scheplot ] .",
    "the disk is drawn to be thicker for the hb to represent a slim disk , and is thinner for the fb to represent a standard thin disk . on the hb ,",
    "the disk is surrounded by a comptonizing corona with a temperature of about 6 kev , based on our fits with model  2 in this work .",
    "nearly one half of the thermal disk is scattered at the top of the hb , but this quantity has a strong dependence on @xmath30 ( section  [ sec : spectralfit ] ) .",
    "the optical depth of the corona is about a few from model  2 , based on its relation with @xmath37 and @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "the comptonized component is strong only at the top of the hb , making it hard to measure the variation of the optical depth along the z track .",
    "thus we can not easily infer whether the decrease of the comptonization emission as the source descends the hb is due to the decrease of the covering fraction of the corona or due to the decrease of its optical depth .",
    "we add some small arrows in figure  [ fig : scheplot ] to indicate the possible strong hot mass outflow at the very inner part of the accretion disk in this system .",
    "this is expected to be a common phenomenon for a disk accretion system at high accretion rates , in which the mass can be input into the disk from outside and ejected as a disk wind at the very inner part of the disk where the emission perpendicular to the disk plan reaches the local eddington limit @xcite .",
    "the mass outflow can also explain the low bb luminosity , relative to the disk luminosity ( discussed below ) .    figure  [ fig : scheplot ] does not include the jet component that is possibly responsible for the radio emission detected from this system .",
    "@xcite observed the radio emission to decrease significantly from the hb to the fb along the z track and found it to correlate with a hard spectral component ( the `` hard tail '' ) , which they fitted with a pl . in this paper",

    "however , we found that consistent results can also be obtained if we fitted our data with their model ( the same as the one used by @xcite ) .",
    "the cpl / nthcomp component in our model was also observed to decrease significantly from the hb to the fb , in a similar way as the hard tail in @xcite , thus probably also correlating with the radio emission .",
    "it played a similar role as the pl component in @xcite in that both of them are the dominating spectral component at energies above 30 kev when they are the strongest , at the top of the hb .",
    "we have shown that the cpl / nthcomp model described our data better than the pl model ( figure  [ fig : comdelchi ] ) .",
    "we note that the hb spectra in @xcite seemed to extend above 60 kev , which was not seen in our hb spectra .",
    "the 60100 kev hexte count rates are about three @xmath76 and about 2% of the background level in their hb observation 70023 - 01 - 01 - 00 . to check whether the apparent lack of the hard tail above 60 kev in our data is due to relatively small exposures of our @xmath10-resolved spectra ( each with a few ks at the top of the hb , compared to @xmath010 ks for the spectrum in @xcite ) , we combined the spectra of the first five @xmath10 selections ( representing the upper half of the hb , where the hard tail was reported to be strongest ) , resulting in a spectrum with an exposure time of @xmath020 ks .",
    "we found that the source was detected at less than one @xmath76 in the 60100 kev band ( combining data from both hexte clusters ) , suggesting that this ( additional ) hard emission may be transient , even for the same location in the z track .",

    "are required , with the non - thermal one accounting for most of the hard tail above @xmath030 kev . in the bulk motion comptonization model ( using the _ bmc _ model @xcite in xspec ) , the hard tail is caused by compton upscattering of soft photons by energetic electrons in a converging flow onto the ns .",
