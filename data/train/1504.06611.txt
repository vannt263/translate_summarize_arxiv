    "human behavior is generally complex",
    ". considerable amount of resources are , and have been , dedicated to characterize and understand how humans behave as individuals , or collectively  @xcite . the struggle of humans when playing well defined games according to some set of rules , provides a convenient experimental setup to understand human behavior and decision making process  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly convenient from the physics point of view , because under the rules of a game , the huge number of degrees of freedom the systems have are highly constrained and more easily quantifiable .",
    "moreover , very well documented records of games are constantly created and updated in electronic format , facilitating the statistical analysis .",
    "for instance , recent studies have tried to understand the statistics of wins and losses in baseball teams @xcite , the final standing in basketball leagues @xcite , the distribution of career longevity in baseball @xcite , the football goal distribution @xcite , and face to face game rank distributions @xcite .",
    "useful parallels can be established between the statistical patterns of game - based human behavior , and well defined theories of physical processes .",
    "for example , the time evolution of the results table during a season can be interpreted as a random walk @xcite , and long - range correlations have been found in the score evolution of the game of cricket @xcite .",
    "the game of chess , which is viewed as a symbol of intellectual prowess , is not the exception  @xcite .",
    "since the skill level of chess players can be correctly and quantitatively identified @xcite , chess has contributed to the scientific understanding of expertise @xcite . in addition , there is a big world - wide community of chess players , which makes the game a benchmark for studying decision making processes @xcite and population level learning @xcite . in particular , the study of long - range correlations in systems where zipf s law is present is also important , since it has been observed in literary corpora @xcite and because systems which exhibit zipf s law need a certain degree of coherence @xcite for its emergence .    in the game of chess each possible move sequence   can be mapped as one directed path in a corresponding game tree . here",
    ", the root node is the initial position of the game , the moves are represented by the edges , and there is a one - to - one correspondence between move sequences and vertices .",
    "the game depth @xmath0 is the topological distance , or shortest path length , between the root and the node reached after the last move .",
    "exploring chess databases , blasius and tnjes @xcite observed that the pooled distribution of chess opening weights follows a zipf law with universal exponent .",
    "this is a remarkable result @xcite where the zipf law holds over six orders of magnitude .",
    "they also established that the popularity distribution follows a power law in which the exponent depends on the depth @xmath0 of the game tree .",
    "they explained these findings in terms of an analytical treatment of a multiplicative process . in a recent paper  @xcite",
    ", we study the dynamics of the game tree growth . more specifically , we find that the emerging zipf and heaps laws can be explained in terms of nested yule - simon preferential growth processes .",
    "later on , in further studies , we find that empirically generated temporal series using a chronologically ordered chess database exhibit long - range memory effects @xcite .",
    "these memory effects can not be explained with the mechanism based in a multiplicative process , nor the pure yule - simon process . in this sense ,",
    "the mechanism of the evolution of the game tree popularity distribution needs new ingredients in order to reproduce the observed long - range correlations , establishing the problem we address in this work .",
    "we tackle this problem by making use of a result introduced by catutto et al .",
    "@xcite , who modifies the yule - simon process by incorporating a probabilistic memory kernel .",
    "this model has the advantage that while memory is introduced , the long - tailed frequency distribution is preserved . for simplicity",
    ", we refer to this model as the catutto s model ( cm ) .",
    "we generate artificial databases from the cm and detect long - range correlations under plausible values of the model parameters . in particular , the hurst exponent  @xcite obtained from the cm depends on the length of the analyzed time series , in agreement with the behavior observed for the empirical chess database . in addition , the inter - event time distribution of the most popular openings is well reproduced by cm .",
    "the parameters of the memory kernel extension in cm are correlated with the expertise of the players showing that strategies for choosing a opening line is related to the level of expertise .",
    "one of the first models able to explain the emergence of zipf s law was introduced by yule @xcite , which was devised to explain the emergence of power laws in the sizes distribution of biological genera .",
    "later on , simon @xcite introduced a similar , but less general variation of the model  @xcite , which fits more naturally in the context of zipf s law .",
    "it is known as the yule - simon model ( ysm ) , and different variations of the model re - emerged in the literature several times .",
    "its most recent variant , known as preferential attachment , became one of the more important ideas at the beginning of complex networks theory  @xcite .",
    "cattuto et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a variant of the ysm , which includes memory effects by incorporating a kernel , while at the same time preserving the long tail frequency distribution exhibited by the ysm .",
    "the ysm model applied to chess game generation is as follows .",
    "we begin with an initial state of @xmath1 games . at each temporal step @xmath2",
    "there are two options : i ) to introduce a new game with probability @xmath3 or ii ) to copy an already existing game with probability @xmath4 . in the latter case",
    "we have to determine which of the previous games is being copied .",
    "the probability of choosing a game that has already occurred @xmath5 times is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the fraction of games with frequency @xmath5 at time @xmath2 .",
    "this means that copying a certain game does not depend on how far back in time the game took place .",
    "for this reason , the process does not exhibit long - range memory effects .",
    "for cattuto s model ( cm ) , we follow the same procedure , except that now , the probability of copying a game that occurred at time @xmath8 is no longer constant , but has the functional form : @xmath9 in eq .  , @xmath10 is a time scale in which recently added games have comparable probabilities and can be considered as the memory kernel extension .",
    "@xmath11 is a logarithmic normalization factor .",
    "the probability distribution density of the game frequencies that results from this process is @xcite : @xmath12^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha } -1},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a fit parameter .      in order to study long - range correlations of a chronologically ordered",
    "chess database we map the database to a time series assigning a real number to each game .",
    "it is known that the assignation rule used in the map has a direct effect in the degree of persistence observed in the series @xcite . in other words ,",
    "long - range correlations are affected both by the intrinsic properties of the database and by the mapping code .",
    "taking this into account we use several assignation rules to study the persistence of memory effects in the database .",
    "one of these rules , which is introduced in the analysis of literary corpora @xcite and already employed in a chess database @xcite , is the popularity assignation rule ( par ) . in par",
    ", each element of the time series , @xmath17 , corresponds to the popularity at depth @xmath0 of the @xmath2-th game in the database .",
    "the popularity is equal to the total number of games in the database that have the same sequence of moves up to depth @xmath0 . in this work ,",
    "we introduce three new assignation rules : the elo assignation rule ( ear ) , the gaussian assignation rule ( gar ) , and the uniform assignation rule ( uar ) .",
    "ear makes use of the information of the players elo available in the chess database , where the elo is a standard measure used in chess to estimate the skill of chess players . in ear",
    ", we assign to each game the average elo corresponding to all games with the same moves up to depth @xmath0 , where , for each game , we took the elo corresponding to the most skillful player of the two .",
    "finally , gar and uar are random assignation rules .",
    "more specifically , a random number taken from certain probability distribution function , e.g. gaussian ( gar ) or uniform ( uar ) , is assigned to each different game .",
    "it is expected that all of these assignations do not introduce spurious correlations .",
    "there exists a wide variety of techniques to detect long - range correlations in time series , but not all suitable to analyze all kinds of series , especially if they are non - stationary or exhibit underlying trends .",
    "al.@xcite introduced the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) , a useful technique for detecting long - range correlations in time series with non - stationarities . in the dfa method the cumulated series @xmath18 is segmented into intervals of size @xmath19 . at each segment",

    "is expected to be linear .",
    "if the slope is less than unity , it corresponds to the hurst exponent .",
    "when @xmath23 the cumulated time series , @xmath18 , resembles a memoryless random walker . on the other hand , for @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) a random walker with persistent ( anti - persistent ) long - range correlations or memory effects .",
    "we analyze the _ chessdb _ dataset , which contains around 1.4 million chess games played between the years 1998 and 2007  .",
    "our first goal is to find the best choices for the models parameters @xmath3 for the ysm , and @xmath3 and @xmath10 for the cm , in order to reproduce the different statistical patterns observed in the chess database .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath3 can be directly measured from the database , using the formula    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the total number of games in the database , and @xmath28 is the number of nodes in the game tree at depth @xmath0 , after @xmath29 games i.e .",
    "all games have been considered .",
    "following the ideas used in the analysis of earthquakes @xcite , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the frequency distribution of inter - event times corresponding to the fraction of the most popular openings in the database .",
    "more specifically , we compute the frequency @xmath5 of all openings , then we filter all openings with frequency lower that @xmath30",
    ". the resulting subset corresponds to the @xmath31 of the chess games in the database , and the @xmath32 of the games generated with the cm . for the database , we considered the set of openings corresponding to game depth @xmath33 .",
    "both , cm and ysm yield to a good agreement with the chess database .",
    "however , in order to find a good fit in the ysm , the value of @xmath3 has to be overestimated as compared to the mean value measured in the real database . for the sake of comparison , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the inter - event time distribution for the ysm , when the value of @xmath3 is set to the one measured in the database .",
    "this curve clearly deviates from the measured to the database . while the measured value of @xmath3 in the chess database is @xmath34 , the value that yields the best fit of the inter - event time distribution with ysm is @xmath35 . on the other hand , using cm we obtain a good fit with the right value of @xmath3 when the other parameter , defining the characteristic time scale of the memory kernel ( see eq .  ) is @xmath36 .",
    "a correct model for the inter - event has to take into account a memory of the previous played games as it is evidenced in the time series associated to the real databases .",
    "the fact that cm model works better suggest that the memory kernel could be the necessary mechanism to describe the long - range correlations observed in the chess database  @xcite .    in order to test the existence of memory directly from the inter - event time distribution of the database",
    ", we fitted a generalized gamma distribution @xmath37 typically used to describe the inter - event times observed between earthquakes , which are known to be strongly correlated events  @xcite . we find that a good fit is obtained restricting the value of @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "the value of @xmath40 is also close to @xmath41 ; in this case @xmath42 ( see inset in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this means that the inter - event time of the database is similar to an homogeneous poisson process ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "besides the fact that the exponential is slightly stretched , memory effects can not be derived directly from the fittings parameters .",
    "is quite direct to see that a poisson process is a good approximation for the inter - event time of the ysm , and also in the cm .",
    "therefore this is the reason of why both ysm and cm can be well fitted to the inter - event times of the database . in the case of the ysm ,",
    "the probability @xmath44 that an already existing game is repeated between time @xmath2 and @xmath45 is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is number of games of the game to be repeated , and @xmath22 is the total number of games ; both quantities specified at time @xmath2 . after a transient time",
    "@xmath48 is expected to be nearly constant   in the ysm process , and then @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , also becomes constant . since the fitting of eq.([eq5 ] ) in the database turns out to be @xmath39 and @xmath42 , then @xmath51 .",
    "the fraction of the most popular games used for building the inter - event time of the database is @xmath52 and so @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "considering that the values of @xmath55 from the fitting is @xmath56 , the inter - event time in the database can be considered as a nearly homogeneous poisson process . in cm ,",
    "the memory kernel imposes a restriction to the games that can be replicated , behaving like a window that looks at the most recent games , however if in this window the fraction of the games under consideration remains constant during the entire process , then it is similar to the ysm and therefore this is also a poisson process .",
    "the difference is that now @xmath55 depends on both @xmath3 and @xmath10 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath10 of the relaxation time @xmath55 is in particular important because it allows to fit the cm to the database with a realistic value of @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we warn the reader that in the chess database the number of different games grows in time according to the heaps law  @xcite , and not linearly as in eq .  .",
    "more specifically , it holds @xmath57 for some @xmath58 which depends on the game depth , @xmath0 , considered .",
    "therefore , eq .   is just an approximation that we choose to work with in order to keep things simple since in the cm model @xmath3 is kept constant . moreover ,",

    "[ fig3 ] shows the hurst exponent as function of the length of the analyzed time series , for the par .",

    "these observations reinforce the use of the inter - time event frequency distribution to detect the level of expertise of the chess players in the database since this analysis does not use an assignation rule . in this sense",
    ", we find through the fittings of the inter - time frequency distribution using cm model , that the characteristic time @xmath10 increases as the expertise of the players increases .",
    "since @xmath10 fixes the memory kernel extension , this indicates that high level players use on average more opening lines than less expert players .",
    "this has a direct interpretation since it is expected for more expert players to have a more extensive knowledge of opening lines .",
    "these supports previous results where the expertise of the players was detected using long - range correlations analysis ."

    "<S> in particular , we find the inter - event time distribution properties to be correlated with the expertise of the chess players through the memory kernel extension . </S>",
    "<S> our work provides new information about the strategies implemented by players with different levels of expertise , showing an interesting example of how popularities and long - range correlations build together during a collective learning process . </S>"
