    "the work of simon was stimulated by the findings of abarbanel , callan and goldberger @xcite , who had obtained the expression for the lowest eigenvalue to order @xmath8 , when @xmath2 is a short range potential .",
    "interestingly , as mentioned by simon in a note added in proof , the leading order term of this expansion had already been presented in the `` quantum mechanics '' book by landau and lifshitz  @xcite .",
    "more recently , patil  @xcite has obtained the perturbative expression for the lowest eigenvalue to order @xmath9 for short range potentials , using a perturbative expansion for the inverse of the t matrix , and discussed the case of long range potentials as well .    of particular interest to the present work ,",

    "@xcite , and obtaining the exact contribution of order @xmath10 , which had not been previously calculated .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ sec : pt ] we describe the method of gat and rosenstein ; in section [ sec : pc ] we work out the explicit expressions for the contributions to the energy of the ground state to fourth , fifth and sixth order in perturbation theory ; in section [ sec : app ] we discuss three applications of the formulas obtained in this paper ; finally , in section [ concl ] we state our conclusions .",

    "the first step in the application of the method is the suitable modification of the hamiltonian , introducing a weak attractive delta potential : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the `` unperturbed hamiltonian '' .",

    "@xcite , for instance , reports the expressions up to fourth order ) , the higher orders must be calculated explicitly .",
    "we report the general expressions for the perturbative corrections to the energy of the ground state of eq.([eq_sch ] ) up to sixth order , obtained using the ncalgebra package for mathematica  @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18    upon using the explicit expressions for the green s functions ( reported in [ appa ] ) and taking the limit @xmath19 at the end of the calculation , one can obtain the exact expressions for the perturbative corrections to the energy of the ground state .",
    "the calculation of the corrections up to third order has been performed by gat and rosenstein in their paper @xcite , therefore we concentrate on the next three orders . in this section",
    "we present the calculation of the fourth , fifth and sixth orders , using the method of gat and rosenstein .",
    "the fourth and fifth orders obtained here reproduce the result obtained earlier by patil , whereas the sixth order is new .",
    "the direct substitution of the expressions for the green s functions inside the fourth order correction leads to a rather lengthy expression ; it is instructive to report this expression explicitly , that reads @xmath20 where @xmath21    it is easy to see that the infrared divergent term in the above expression , proportional to @xmath22 , identically vanishes , appropriately relabeling the variables : @xmath23 \\nonumber \\\\ &",

    "we obtain @xmath31    with a suitable relabeling it is possible to reduce @xmath32 to a simpler form : @xmath33    combining the contributions above one finally obtains the expression for the fourth order @xmath34 which agrees with the expression calculated by patil  .",
    "the calculation of the higher order contributions is performed in the similar way as for the fourth order ; in the case of the fifth order contribution the expression contains potentially infrared divergent terms of order @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath22 . upon symmetrization and suitable relabeling of the integration variables one can show that each of these contributions identically vanishes , as expected .    as a result ,",
    "only the term of order @xmath37 survives and , upon simplification , it takes the form @xmath38 that agrees with the fifth order contribution calculated by patil .",
    "the calculation of the sixth order contribution is considerably more involved than the fifth order , although it can be performed along the same lines . in this case",

    "once again , one finds that each of these contributions identically vanishes when a symmetrization of the integrands and a suitable relabeling of the integration variable is carried out .    after performing all the algebra ,",
