    "because of the importance of classical cepheid variable stars as primary extragalactic distance indicators , it is extremely important to understand them as fully as possible .",

    "conversely , because cepheids have a well defined luminosity from the period  luminosity  color relation ( plc ) they provide a uniquely strong test for the evolutionary tracks of objects evolved beyond the main sequence .",
    "the inconsistency between the masses predicted from evolutionary tracks and pulsation calculations ( called the  cepheid mass problem \" since the 1960 s ) has now been resolved with a reevaluation of envelope opacities ( iglesias and rogers 1991 ) . on the other hand ,",

    "luminosity provides a very strong test of evolutionary calculations .",
    "the advent of satellite ultraviolet spectroscopy has made it possible for the first time to measure the orbital velocity amplitude of a few hot companions of cepheids .",
    "the mass of the cepheid can then be obtained by combining this amplitude with the orbital velocity amplitude of the cepheid from the ground - based orbit and a mass inferred from the spectral type of the companion .",
    "a summary of these measured cepheid masses provided by iue and hst spectroscopy is given in evans et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "double mode cepheids have been particularly important in discussions of observed and theoretical masses .",
    "in addition to masses inferred from a  pulsation constant \" ( theoretical period - mass - radius relation ) , a mass can be determined from theoretical predictions of the period ratios of the fundamental and first overtone periods .",
    "y car = hd 91595 is a bright double mode cepheid that was discovered by stobie and balona ( 1979 ) to be a member of a binary system .",
    "an orbit was derived by balona ( 1983 ) .",
    "the hot companion to the cepheid was detected by evans ( 1992a ) in an iue observation from which the luminosity of the cepheid was determined together with the spectral type of the companion . a study with the hst ghrs ( bhm  vitense et al .",
    "1997 ) obtained velocities of the companion and produced a measurement of the mass although with large error bars of @xmath1 32% .",
    "in order to improve the accuracy of the velocities of the companion y car b , we observed it using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) in the echelle high dispersion mode , e230h , which provides a resolution of @xmath2/228000 ( kimble , et al .",
    "the wavelength range was centered on 1763  , with a typical dispersion of 1.3 km sec@xmath0px@xmath0 the observation was taken over 8 orbits , 5 on may 3 , 2002 , 3 on may 7 , 2002 .",
    "several aspects of the observation were designed to obtain the maximum velocity accuracy .",
    "special wavelength calibration observations were obtained at the beginning and end of each orbit .",
    "the exposure time was 10 times longer than the standard wavcal observations in order to bring up faint lines , and provide more counts in stronger lines . in order for the target to be centered in the aperture as precisely as possible , a ",
    "peakup \" was done at the beginning of the first and fourth orbits on the first day , and the first orbit on the second day . as a result of the wavelength calibrations and the target centering",
    ", the line centers are expected to be located to an accuracy of 0.2 px or 0.26 km sec@xmath0 .",
    "in addition to observations of y car , we also obtained data on the a1 v standard star hd 72660 .",
    "this star has a spectral type near that of the cepheid companion and a very low rotation velocity .",
    "it s velocity ( fekel , 1996 , using 68 tau as a comparison ) is 2.9 @xmath1 0.2 km / s .",
    "the observations for both stars were analyzed using the calstis software , which was developed for the stis idt ( instrument definition team ) at goddard space flight center .",
    "this software applied a flat field to the data and removed the effects of bad pixels , hot pixels and doppler motions .",
    "it then located each echelle order on the detector and determined the background intensity by measuring between the echelle orders .",
    "the individual orders were then extracted , background subtracted and a wavelength and flux calibration were applied .",
    "the 8 individual observations were then combined into a final spectrum .    to determine the velocity of the cepheid companion we cross - correlated each of the extracted orders of the final y car observation with the corresponding order in the hd 72660 observation , after placing both on the same wavelength scale .",
    "each correlation then corresponds to an independent estimate of the relative velocity .",
    "the correlation functions were examined and it was found that 29 of the first 32 orders ( covering the wavelength region between 1760 and 1900  ) had well defined peaks in their correlations . for higher orders the correlations disintegrated and gave no useful results .",
    "this was caused by the decreasing s / n resulting from the rapid decrease in spectrograph sensitivity towards shorter wavelengths .",
    "the velocities measured from the 29 reliable orders range from -35 to -47 km s@xmath0 and have an apparently normal distribution centered on the median value of -40.5 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the rms deviation for the sample was 4 km s@xmath0 . assuming that the distribution is gaussian , then the uncertainty in the median value is 4/@xmath3 , or 0.7 km s@xmath0 .",
    "correcting for the velocity of hd 72660 then yields a velocity of -37.6 @xmath1 0.7 km s@xmath0 for y car b. may 5 , 2002 ( jd 2452399.5 ) is the date midway between the two days on which the stis observations were obtained .    to test the effects of noise on the calculated velocities ,",
    "we cross - correlated a y car spectrum which was made up of the 5 exposures taken on 03 may with a spectrum composed of the 3 exposures made on 07 may . to improve the s / n , both spectra were smoothed with a 20 point boxcar . in this case , only 6 of the orders generated reliable velocity estimates , giving an average velocity difference of v(may 3 ) - v(may 7 ) = 7.4 @xmath1 0.6 km s@xmath0 .",
    "while the uncertainty is in agreement with expectations , the velocity difference is much larger than can be easily explained by instrumental effects .",
    "the orbit of the cepheid y car a was redetermined using new velocities obtained by kienzle ( 2000 , private communication ) . the stis observation was taken at phase 0.10 in this orbit .",
    "the cepheid orbital plus systemic velocity at this phase is -24.4 km sec@xmath0 , or -11.9",
    "km sec@xmath0 with respect to the systemic velocity . if the companion , y car b , had a mass equal to the cepheid , its measured velocity ( orbital plus systemic ) at this phase would be -0.6 km sec@xmath0 . a companion less massive than the cepheid would have an even more positive velocity .",
    "1 shows that this is clearly not what was measured for y car b. the simplest explanation is that the companion is itself a short period binary , and hence may have large velocities from the short period orbit added to the velocities from the orbit with the cepheid .",
    "unfortunately , it would require a large number of observations in the ultraviolet to determine the short period orbit .",
    "a binary companion would also be consistent with one aspect of the data which we originally found perplexing , the fact that there is a 7 km sec@xmath0 difference between velocities taken four days apart , but with a small ( 0.6 km sec@xmath0 ) uncertainty in this difference .",
    "here we are presumably seeing motion in the short period orbit .",
    "we note the correlation of the segments of the exposure taken on different days demonstrates that we were able to measure a velocity with an interal accuracy of approximately 0.5 km sec@xmath0 ( for each velocity ) with an exposure time about a third of our original estimate , a useful benchmark for future observations .",
    "unfortunately , the discovery that y car is a member of a triple system means that the quite plausible mass estimate obtained by bohm - vitense , et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , using velocities obtained from hst ghrs ( goddard high resolution spectrograph ) spectra was apparently entirely fortuitous . the fact that the velocity amplitude looked reasonable must have been simply due to coincidence - the y car b binary phase must have been such that it did not greatly alter the motion expected due to the orbit of the original companion ( i.e. y car b itself ) around the cepheid .",
    "the large measurement uncertainties in the ghrs data would also help to mask any modest effects of the third star on the velocity of y car b. for example , one spectrum was very weak , while the other was made through the large science aperture before the costar ( corrective optics space telescope axial replacement ) was in place to correct spherical aberation , and centering of the target in the large aperture was more uncertain than in later spectra .",
    "the resultant velocity measurement uncertainty was estimated to be 7 km / sec , much larger than for other stars measured by the same authors . for reference ,",
    "the previous ghrs observations were made at orbital phases 0.728 and 0.025 .",
    "we based the mass estimate on the velocity difference , between the two rather than the individual velocities to control against differences due to differences between y car b and the template spectrum .",
    "however , for comparison with the stis result here , for phase 0.728 , the velocity was -35.2 or -33.4 km sec@xmath0 depending on whether the comparison star was hd 72660 or @xmath4 lyr . for phase 0.025 ,",
    "the velocity was -8.0 or -2.0 sec@xmath0 for the same comparison stars .",
    "figure 1 shows that those are reasonable velocities for the companion at the respective orbital phases , although we based our mass estimate on the orbital velocity amplitude rather than the absolute velocities .    for the present stis spectrum",
    ", we can compare the velocity difference over 4 days with the possible periods in short period orbits . the observed velocity implies an orbital velocity semi - amplitude of at least 50 km sec@xmath0 for the companion ( fig .",
    "the 7 km sec@xmath0 velocity difference over 4 days could result from a period near 4 days or even a period half this length . on the other hand ,",
    "4 days could be only a fraction of an orbit .",
    "the simplest guess for an orbit ( two linear segments ) provides a crude estimate of the period of 20 days in this case .",
    "these estimates from the velocity change are reasonable for the short period , and would be compatible with a hierarchal structure for the system .",
    "triple systems have been a continuing surprise in the study of cepheid binaries , particularly since ultraviolet spectroscopy has become available to observe the secondary in detail . typically , but not always , a third star in the system is found when the spectrum of the second star becomes available , e.g. in velocity measures of the secondary . in systems containing a cool star with a hot companion , there are also a number of ways of inferring a third star from the energy distribution ( parsons , 2003 )    in table 1 we present a summary of available information on the multiplicity of cepheids in binary systems .",
    "the basis for this list is table 1a in evans ( 1995 ) , containing systems for which orbits have been determined . in the decade",
    "since that list was put together , binary motion and orbits have been determined for a number of additional systems ( see szabados : http://www.konkoly.hu/cep/intro.html ) .",
    "systems with orbits have been added to table 1 . the source for the orbits since the evans summary is listed in column 6 of table 1 , with the period ( column 2 ) and the eccentricity ( column 3 ) taken from that source .",
    "column 4 indicates the multiplicity of the system , as discussed in the reference listed in column 7 .",
    "column 5 indicates whether high resolution spectra have been taken in the ultraviolet to measure the velocity of the companion .",
    "h indicates an hst spectrum : i indicates an iue spectrum where there is no hst spectrum .",
    "table 1 is organized in two sections .",
    "the stars with the most complete information and hence the highest probability of determining the full multiplicity of the system are listed at the top .",
    "those are the stars with both an orbit and also an iue low resolution spectrum of the companion .",
    "below those are stars with an orbit ( by cas , vz cyg , and mw cyg ) but which are faint and do not have an ultraviolet spectrum of the companion . in some cases ( e.g. s sgr and aw per ) , the presence of a third star was inferred from the combination of a mass function and a companion with a mass ( from the ultraviolet temperature ) too small to be compatible with a reasonable cepheid mass .",
    "the stars in this bottom group have no way to identify a such binary companion .",
    "we provide comments here on two stars in table 1 .",
    "v1334 cyg : this low amplitude cepheid is a spectroscopic binary .",
    "it was also has had repeated visual observations in the past indicating a companion with a separation of 0.1 \" , leading to the double star designation ads 14859 .",
    "this orbit is much larger than that of the spectroscopic binary orbit .",
    "however , a recent hst study has not resolved the system ( evans , et al . ,",
    "2005a ) , so we still do not understand the system fully .",
    "ff aql : again , the cepheid is a member of a spectroscopic binary .",
    "a companion 7 `` distant does not seem to be physically related ( udalski and evans , 1993 ) .",
    "in addition , the system has repeatedly been resolved by speckle interferometry ( mcalister , et al .",
    "1989 ) indicating a companion with a separation between 7 '' and the separation of the spectroscopic binary companion .",
    "however , the speckle measures appear to move with respect to the cepheid much more than can be accounted for by the long period orbital motion for that separation .",
    "apparently neither  companion \" is physically related to the cepheid .",
    "an estimate of the frequency of triple systems among binary systems can be made from the data in table 1 .",
    "we will use the 18 stars which have orbits as well as a direct ultraviolet observation of the companion ( top 18 in the list ) , since those are the ones in which a third star can be detected .",
    "eight or 44% of those stars are actually triple systems .",
    "v1334 cyg may be a triple , which would raise the percentage to 50% .",
    "this is a surprisingly high fraction of systems which have more than two stars .",
    "there are several ways in which this summary may under or over estimate the detected percentage :    @xmath5 under estimate : even the well studied stars in table 1 may not have a full census of more distant companions since we have made no particular effort to determine the relationship to nearby resolved stars .",
    "@xmath5 over estimate : there is , on the other hand , a factor that inflates the fraction .",
    "if the secondary is over - massive , the orbital velocity amplitude of the cepheid will be larger , which , of course , makes it more likely to be detected and studied .",
    "@xmath5 under estimate : only 8 of the systems in the top list in table 1 have had velocities of the companions measured from high resolution ultraviolet spectra . even from that list , we were not able to find a velocity signal for aw per b. in addition , even a complete high resolution survey could still miss face on systems , however such a survey would result in a very high probability of detection a binary companion .",
    "that is , even our 18 best studied systems have seriously incomplete information for identifying triple systems .    on balance",
    ", it seems likely that the fraction of triple systems in table 1 is under estimated .",
    "there is one further marker from ultraviolet low resolution spectra which confirms the identification of triple systems .",
    "the iue low resolution spectrum of su cyg b shows a strong ga ii feature at 1414@xmath6 ( wahlgren and evans 1998 ) , the signature of a hgmn star .",
    "since the feature is very prominent , this provides a way to detect likely triple systems from a single low resolution iue spectrum of the companion .",
    "because chemically peculiar stars require unusually slow rotation to allow for diffusive element settling , they are usually found in short period binaries where rotation has been slowed by synchronization with the orbit .",
    "we note that in the list of evans ( 1995 ) of stars with orbital motion ( but not complete orbits ) and iue observations , ( xx cen , ax cir , t mon , at pup , and v465 mon ) , one on them ( t mon ) is also chemically peculiar ( evans , et al . 1999 ) , in this case a magnitic star with a spectrum very similar to @xmath7 cvn .",
    "tokovinin ( 2004 ) has assembled a catalogue of multiple star systems .",
    "he discusses the range of period ratios p@xmath8/p@xmath9 ( outer and inner periods in triple systems ) found for low mass stars within 50 pc . for p@xmath9 @xmath10",
    "10 days he finds p@xmath8/p@xmath9 @xmath11 10@xmath12 .",
    "he discusses the empirical description of the upper limit of p@xmath8/p@xmath9 :    @xmath13    where e is the eccentricity of the outer orbit . in table 2",
    "we list the upper limit on the inner period for values of p@xmath8 and e@xmath8 typical of cepheid systems .",
    "the orbital parameters for y car predict that the inner period should be less than 31 days .",
    "this is an agreement with the discussion of the short period earlier in this section .",
    "one implication of these results demonstrating a large number of short period binaries in cepheid systems is that presumably many of the cepheids themselves were also once short period binaries , which would have coalesced .",
    "if the result is simply a star with the combined mass of the binary pair , it may proceed to become a cepheid with no obvious signs of its former status .",
    "it would , however , belong to a younger isochrone than the original pair .",
    "a coalescence scenario has been suggested by alcock , et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to explain the period distribution of the cepheids in the lmc .",
    "specifically , they find proportionately too many short period cepheids , which they suggest is the result of coalesced lower mass binaries . as they point out ,",
    "this is the scenario for  anomalous cepheids \" ( which is what some of their short period stars would be ) , and also for blue stragglers .",
    "one aspect of this scenario is that the  blue loops \" of the he burning phase extend to hotter temperatures than for single star evolution , and hence reach the instability strip .",
    "blue loops which are too cool have also been found , for instance , in comparing the components of binary cepheids with evolutionary tracks ( e.g. evans , 1995 ) .",
    "revision of the evolutionary history of the cepheids to include coalescence would produce tracks with blue loops extending to hotter temperatures , and might resolve this problem .    how does this fraction for supergiants compare with other triple fractions ?",
    "tokovinin ( 2004 ) estimates that the fraction of multiple systems with more than 2 stars in his catalogue is 20 % .",
    "however , comparing the f , g , and k dwarfs in his catalogue and comparable stars in the hipparcos catalogue , he finds the percentage of triple stars decreases from 17% within 10 pc to 2% within 50 pc .",
    "he attributes this to serious incompleteness as the distance increases , partly due to the fact that identifying higher order multiples often requires more than one kind of observation .",
    "evans ( 1992b ) surveyed of cepheids using ultraviolet low resolution spectra from iue . the fraction of cepheids with a hot companion from the survey ( corrected to the fraction which would be detected in a reasonably sensitive radial velocity survey ) is 34 % . as discussed by evans ( 1995 ) ,",
    "the list of cepheids with orbits is quite complete except for the combination of periods longer than 10 years and very small mass ratios .",
    "since we have found 44 % of the binaries have an additional companion , this implies 15 % of cepheids are in high order multiples .",
    "this is comparable to the fraction tokovinin found for the dwarfs within 10 pc .",
    "that is , studies of cepheids with a variety of techniques have produced a fraction of multiple systems similar to the best studied dwarfs .",
    "we have obtained a stis ultraviolet high dispersion echelle mode spectrum of the double mode classical cepheid y car .",
    "the velocity measured for the hot companion from this spectrum is not consistent with binary motion , implying that the companion is itself a short period binary .",
    "the fact that the velocity changed by 7 km sec@xmath0 during the 4 days between two segments of the observation confirms this interpretation .",
    "we have summarized  binary \" cepheids which are in fact members of triple systems . from the list of stars without ultraviolet ( iue ) spectra ,",
    "44% are triples .",
    "possible sources of bias in this fraction are discussed , and we conclude that the fraction is underestimated .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank bruce woodgate , ted gull , jeff valenti , tom ayres and don lindler for useful conversations about the accuracy of stis velocities .",
    "an anonymous referee made several comments that helped the presentation of the paper .",
