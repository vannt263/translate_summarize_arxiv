    "neutrino flavor oscillations have been established beyond any doubt by a series of outstanding results from atmospheric @xcite , solar @xcite , reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino experiments .",
    "neutrino flavor oscillations require neutrinos to be massive and mixed , and they have thus provided the first unambiguous hint for physics beyond the standard model of elementary particles .",
    "the neutrino mixing matrix , called @xmath3 @xcite , can be parameterized in terms of three mixing angles @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath2 , and a charge - parity violating ( cp ) phase @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , if neutrinos were majorana particles , we would have two majorana cp phases @xmath7 and @xmath8 as well .",
    "the frequencies of neutrino oscillations are governed by two mass squared differences , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where we define @xmath11 .",
    "the so - called solar neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath4 and @xmath9 have been measured from the combined analysis of the kamland reactor @xmath12 data and the solar neutrino data .",
    "the so - called atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath2 and @xmath13 are mostly constrained by the super - kamiokande ( sk ) atmospheric , and minos as well as t2k @xmath14 disappearance data .",
    "the third and the last mixing angle @xmath5 is the latest to be measured by a series of accelerator and reactor experiments . after decades of speculation on whether @xmath5 was zero , data from these experiments have revealed that the value of @xmath5 is not only non - zero , it is in fact just below the previous upper bound @xcite from the chooz experiment .",
    "accelerator - based neutrino experiments t2k and minos have both observed @xmath15 appearance events from a beam of @xmath14 that indicates a non - zero value of @xmath5 .",
    "the short baseline reactor neutrino experiments daya bay , reno and double chooz have excluded @xmath16 at 5.2@xmath17 , 4.9@xmath17 and 3.1@xmath17 respectively from @xmath12 disappearance .",
    "their best fit values are @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite , respectively .",
    "we summarize our current understanding of the neutrino oscillation parameters in table [ tab_osc_param ] .",

    "@xmath29 is calculated for a set of assumed  true value \" of the oscillation parameters , listed in table [ tab_osc_param_input ] .",
    "@xmath35 is the predicted number of events for a given set of oscillation parameters without the systematic errors included . the systematic uncertainties are included via the  pull \" variables @xmath36 , one each for every systematic uncertainty @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is the change in the number of events in the @xmath39 bin caused by varying the value of @xmath40 pull variable @xmath41 by @xmath37 . for determining @xmath38",
    ", we have used a procedure similar to the one described in @xcite .    in this analysis",
    "we have considered the following five systematic uncertainties .",
    "we take 20% error on the flux normalization , 10% error on cross sections , and an overall 5% error on the total number of events . in addition , we take a 5% uncertainty on the zenith angle dependence of the flux , and an energy dependent  tilt error \" is included according to the following prescription .",
    "the event spectrum is calculated with the predicted atmospheric neutrino fluxes and then with the flux spectrum shifted according to @xmath42 where @xmath43 gev and @xmath44 is the @xmath45 systematic tilt error , taken to be 5% .",
    "the difference between @xmath46 and @xmath47 is then included as the error on the flux .    for each set of oscillation parameters ,",
    "we calculate the @xmath21 separately for the @xmath30 and @xmath48 data samples , and add them to obtain the total @xmath21 as @xmath49    since in this analysis we are mainly interested in constraining @xmath2 and @xmath50 , and the variation of @xmath4 or @xmath51 within the current error bars is observed not to affect the results , we take the value of these two parameters to be fixed to those given in table [ tab_osc_param_input ] . on the parameter @xmath52 , we impose a prior to allow for the uncertainty in its current measurement : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the current @xmath45 error on @xmath52 , and is taken as 0.013 in our analysis . of course , during the operation of ino , the error @xmath54 will decrease , and within a few years , @xmath55 may be considered to be a fixed parameter .",
    "we start by presenting the reach of the ical for the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath50 separately .",
    "the true values of all parameters are given in table [ tab_osc_param_input ] .",
    "note that we use the parameter @xmath56 ( = @xmath57 - @xmath58 ) instead of @xmath59 , the current limits on which are given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 values as functions of @xmath60 and @xmath50 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig_chi2_function_th23 ] and [ fig : fig_chi2_function_dms32 ] , respectively .",
    "note that the minimum value of @xmath21 vanishes , since mc fluctuations in the observed data have been reduced due to the scaling from an exposure of 50 kt @xmath61 1000 years .",
    "the precision on these parameters may be quantified by @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the largest and smallest value of the concerned oscillation parameters determined at the given c.l . from the atmospheric neutrino measurements at ical for a given exposure .",
    "we find that after 5 years of running of this experiment , ical would be able to measure @xmath60 to a precision of @xmath65 and @xmath50 to 7.4% at 1@xmath17 . with 10 years exposure",
    ", these numbers improve to 17% and 5.1% for @xmath0 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the precision on @xmath0 is mainly governed by the muon reconstruction efficiency and is expected to improve with it .",
    "it will also improve as the systematic errors are reduced .",
    "if the flux normalization error were to come down from 20% to 10% , the precision on @xmath0 would improve to 14% for 10 years of exposure . reducing the zenith angle error from 5% to 1%",
    "would also improve this precision to @xmath66 14% .",
    "on the other hand , the precision on @xmath50 is governed by the ability of the detector to determine the value of @xmath67 for individual events accurately .",
    "this depends on the energy- and @xmath23- resolution of the detector .",
    "a few more detailed observations may be made from the @xmath21 plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_chi2_function ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_chi2_function_th23 ] one can notice that the precision on @xmath2 when it is in the first octant ( @xmath68 ) is slightly better than when it is in the second octant ( @xmath69 ) , even though the muon neutrino survival probability depends on @xmath70 at the leading order .",
    "this asymmetry about @xmath71 stems mainly from the full three - flavor analysis that we have performed in this study .",
    "in particular , we have checked that the non - zero value of @xmath5 is responsible for the asymmetry observed in this figure . on the other hand , @xmath21 asymmetry about the true value of @xmath50 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_chi2_function_dms32 ] is an effect that is present even with a two - flavor analysis .",
    "the precisions obtainable at the ical for @xmath0 and @xmath50 are expected to be correlated .",
    "we therefore present the correlated reach of ical for these parameters in figs .",
    "[ fig:5yrs ] and [ fig:10yrs ] .",
    "these are the main results of our analysis .",
    "as noted above , our three - neutrino analysis should be sensitive to the octant of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore we choose to present our results in terms of @xmath0 instead of @xmath70 .",
    "though the constant-@xmath21 contours still look rather symmetric about @xmath71 , that is mainly due to the true value of @xmath0 being taken to be 0.5 .",
    "the values of @xmath0 away from 0.5 would make the contours asymmetric and would give rise to some sensitivity to the octant of @xmath2 , as we shall see later .",
    "+    note that in our analysis , we have taken @xmath23 bins of width 0.1 .",
    "the muon angle resolution in ical is however better than @xmath72 for almost all values of the zenith angle .",
    "the reason we had to take such wide angle bins is because of limited statistics . in order to study the impact of our choice of binning on the precision measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath50 in ical , we reduce the @xmath23 bin size to 0.05 and the size of the @xmath32 bins to 0.5 gev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bins ] , we show the effect of taking these finer bins in e and @xmath73 on the precision reach of the two parameters .",
    "the figure corresponds to 10 years of ical exposure .",
    "we see that the finer bins bring only a marginal improvement in the precision measurement of both @xmath0 and @xmath50 . for further results in this paper",
    ", we continue to use energy bins of width 1 gev and zenith angle bins of width 0.1 .",
    "the optimization with variable bin widths will be a part of future work .",
    "10 years data of atmospheric neutrinos in ical .",
    "the black , blue and red lines show 68% , 90% and 99% c.l contours .",
    "the solid lines show the contours for ( e , @xmath23 ) bin widths of ( 1 gev , 0.1 ) while the broken lines show the contours for ( e , @xmath23 ) bin widths of ( 0.5 gev , 0.05 ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_cl_comparision ] we show the comparison of the precision reach on the atmospheric neutrino oscillatino parameters at ical with that obtained from other experiments currently .",
    "note that here we use the parameter @xmath70 instead of @xmath0 in order to enable a direct comparison .",
    "the blue and red lines show the expected sensitivity from atmospheric neutrino measurements at ical after 5 years and the 10 years exposure , respectively .",
    "the green line is the 90% c.l .- allowed contour obtained by the zenith angle analysis of sk atmospheric neutrino measurements ( shown at the neutrino 2012 conference ) , while the pink line is the contour obtained by their @xmath67 analysis @xcite .",

    "the grey ( dot - dot - dashed ) line shows the recent t2k @xmath14 disappearance analysis results for @xmath77 pot @xcite .    .",
    "]    from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_cl_comparision ] it may be observed that , with 5 years of exposure , ical will be able to almost match the precision on @xmath50 obtained from the sk @xmath67 analysis currently . with 10 years data",
    "this will improve , though it will still not be comparable to the precision we already have from the minos experiment . since the direction of neutrinos in minos is known accurately , their @xmath67 is known to a greater precision and their measurement of @xmath50 is consequently more accurate .",
    "the precision of ical on @xmath70 in 10 years may be expected to be comparable to what we currently have from sk .",
    "( of course by the time ical completes 10 years , sk would have gathered even more data . )",
    "this precision is controlled to a large extent by the total number of events .",
    "we can see that the sensitivity of ical to @xmath70 and @xmath50 is not expected to surpass the precision we already have from the current set of experiments .",
    "in fact , the precision on these parameters are expected to improve significantly with the expected data from t2k @xcite and no@xmath78a @xcite , and ical will not be competing with them as far as these precision measurements are concerned .",
    "( the recent t2k results @xcite already claim a precision comparable to ical reach in 10 years . )",
    "the ical data will however give complementary information on these parameters , which will significantly contribute to the improvement of the precision on the global fit .",
    "earth matter effects in atmospheric neutrinos can be used to distinguish maximal from non - maximal @xmath2 mixing and can lead to the determination of the correct @xmath2 octant @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_cl_octant_sensitivity ] the potential of 10 years of ical run for distinguishing a non - maximal value of @xmath2 from maximal mixing in the case where @xmath79 ( @xmath0 = 0.342 , 0.658 ) and @xmath70 = 0.95 ( @xmath0 = 0.388 , 0.612 ) . note that the current 3@xmath17 allowed range of @xmath70 is ( 0.91 , 1.0 ) .",
    "the figure shows that , if the value of @xmath2 is near the current 3@xmath17 bound and in the first octant , then it may be possible to exclude maximal mixing to 99% c.l . with this 2-parameter analysis .",
    "if @xmath2 is in the second octant , or if @xmath70 is larger than 0.9 , the exclusion of the maximal mixing becomes a much harder task .",
    "[ fig : fig_cl_octant_sensitivity ] can also be used to quantify the reach of ical for determining the correct octant of @xmath2 , if the value of @xmath70 is known .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the @xmath21 value corresponding to the true value of @xmath0 , but in the wrong octant , with that corresponding to the true value of @xmath0 .",
    "we find that , for @xmath80 , i.e. just at the allowed 3@xmath17 bound , the octant can be identified at @xmath8195% c.l . with 10 years of ical run if @xmath2 is in the first octant .",
    "however if @xmath2 is in the second octant , the identification of the octant would be much harder : @xmath2 in the wrong octant can be disfavored only to about 85% c.l .. the situation is more pessimistic if @xmath70 is closer to unity .",
    "the precision on @xmath50 will keep improving with ongoing and future long baseline experiments .",
    "the inclusion of the information may improve the chance of ical@ino being able to identify deviation of @xmath2 from maximal mixing and its octant to some extent , however that exercise is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in the analysis , we have calculated the projected reach of the ical experiment at ino for precise determination of the atmospheric neutrino parameters .",
    "we have used nuance simulated data on muon energies and directions using the resolutions and efficiencies obtained from a complete detector simulation by the ino collaboration .",
    "we incorporate the oscillation physics using the re - weighting method and calculate the values of @xmath21 in the @xmath0@xmath50 plane using the pull method that takes into account systematic errors on ( i ) flux normalization ( ii ) cross sections ( iii ) neutrino flux tilt ( iv ) zenith angle dependence of flux and ( v ) overall systematic error .",
    "we present uncorrelated as well as correlated constraints on the value of @xmath0 and @xmath50 expected to be obtained after 10 years of running of the 50 kt ical .",
    "we find that the values of @xmath0 and @xmath50 may be determined at an accuracy of 17% and 5.1% respectively .",
    "the sensitivities with the data at ical only are not expected to be better than what we already have , indeed some of the other experiments in the next decade may do much better .",
    "however the measurement at ical will be complementary and may be expected to contribute significantly towards the precision of parameters in a global fit .    as far as the sensitivity to the @xmath2 octant and its deviation from maximality is concerned , we find that 10 years of ical can exclude maximal mixing or the @xmath2 value in the other octant to @xmath8195% c.l",
    ". only if the actual @xmath2 is in the first octant and close to the current 3@xmath17 lower bound to 99 % c.l .. indeed , the octant identification seem to be beyond the reach of any single experiment in the next decade .",
    "this paper presents the first study on the reach of ical@ino for precision of atmospheric neutrino parameters , using the complete detector simulation .",
    "note that in this analysis we have used only the information on muon events .",
    "however , the ical atmospheric neutrino experiment will also record and measure the hadrons associated with the charged current interaction of the muon - type neutrinos .",
    "inclusion of this data - set into the analysis is expected to provide energy and angle reconstruction of the neutrino .",
    "this could lead to an improved sensitivity of the detector to the oscillation parameters .",
    "the analysis including the hadrons along with the muons is a part of the ongoing effort of the ino - ical collaboration .",
    "in addition , the updates and improvements in the muon momentum reconstruction algorithm as well as the optimization of our analysis procedure are likely to improve the results presented in this paper .",

    "<S> the india - based neutrino observatory ( ino ) will host a 50 kt magnetized iron calorimeter ( ical@ino ) for the study of atmospheric neutrinos . using the detector resolutions and efficiencies obtained by the ino collaboration from a full - detector geant4-based simulation , we determine the reach of this experiment for the measurement of the atmospheric neutrino mixing parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore the sensitivity of this experiment to the octant of @xmath2 , and its deviation from maximal mixing . </S>"
