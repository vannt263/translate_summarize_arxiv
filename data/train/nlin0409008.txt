    "consists of two parts depending on the argument @xmath9 ; @xmath10 for @xmath11 , and @xmath12 for @xmath13 @xcite .    since kardar , parisi , and zhang ( kpz ) proposed the continuous partial differential equation model @xcite , many theoretical and simulational studies have been done .",

    "we show some typical results in table [ tab : expresult ] .",
    "as can be seen in table [ tab : expresult ] , all experiments show @xmath23 for anomalous scaling ( short range ) regime .",

    "if they show constant values independent of @xmath25 , it means mono - affinity and mono - growth property .",
