    "a cryogenic interferometric gravitational wave detector ( large scale cryogenic interferometric gravitational wave telescope : lcgt ) is planned in japan@xcite .",
    "the most outstanding characteristic of lcgt is the use of cryogenic techniques to reduce thermal noise .",
    "lcgt has fiber suspended pendulum - like mirrors similar to other detectors , such as ligo@xcite , virgo@xcite , geo@xcite and tama@xcite .",
    "these suspended mirrors behave as test masses for the detection of gravitational waves .",
    "the gravitational waves are detected by measuring the difference of displacement between mirrors .",
    "thermal noise is the thermally excited vibration of the mirrors@xcite .",
    "major components of the vibration are the pendulum motion ( pendulum thermal noise ) and the elastic vibration of the mirror itself ( mirror thermal noise ) . typically , the pendulum thermal noise is the dominant noise source of the detector in a frequency range from approximately 10hz to 100hz and the mirror thermal noise is dominant from 100hz to 500hz .",
    "the amplitude of the thermal vibration obeys the equation , @xmath1 where _ t _ is the temperature and @xmath2 the dissipation angle .",
    "mechanical quality factor ( q - factor ) is defined as the inverse of @xmath2 at the resonant frequency @xmath3 , i. e. @xmath4 .",
    "phenomenologically , @xmath2 is constant in the frequency range of interest when the dominant source of dissipation is internal friction of the suspension fibers or the mirror substrate .",
    "this is known as structure damping@xcite . for measurement analysis",
    ", we applied the structure damping model and focused attention on the q - factor .    according to eq.[thnoise : eq ] ,",
    "the reduction of the thermal noise is accomplished both by lowering the temperature and by improving the q - factors of both the pendulum and mirror acoustic modes .",
    "our strategy to reduce the thermal noise includes cooling the whole mirror suspension system to cryogenic temperature ( below 30k at the mirror ) , along with the use of low acoustic loss material for the mirror and suspension fiber .",
    "we have chosen sapphire for both the mirror and fiber , since it has shown to have a high q - factor@xcite and high thermal conductivity@xcite at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "we have already presented results of the cryogenic mirror suspension system with a sapphire test mass which was cooled down to cryogenic temperatures and exhibited a q - factor of @xmath5@xcite .",
    "these results suggests that the cryogenic mirror suspension system could possibly reduce the mirror thermal noise .    to enhance the sensitivity of the detector",
    ", we must also reduce the pendulum thermal noise which is estimated by the q - factor of the pendulum motion ( @xmath6 ) with temperature . since @xmath6 depends on the dissipation in the suspension fibers",
    ", we must construct them of low loss materials . since",
    "direct measurement of @xmath6 is not an easy task , we measured the frequency dependence of q - factor of the sapphire fiber itself ( @xmath7 )",
    ". @xmath6 can be obtained by applying the result of the dissipation dilution theorem to @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the measurement was undertaken at cryogenic temperatures ( 6k and 78k ) with one end of the fiber fixed in a clamp and the other end free .",
    "we chose the lowest frequency vibration bending mode of the clamped sapphire fiber , since the deformation of this mode is similar to that of the pendulum motion . applying the structure damping model",
    ", the dissipation in the sapphire fiber due to bending vibration reflects that due to pendulum motion , even though the resonant frequencies are different ( the resonance of the pendulum is 1hz , whereas that of the fiber is 200hz to 500hz ) .",
    "room temperature measurement of @xmath7 of the sapphire fiber represents @xmath8 at 200hz@xcite .",
    "this q - factor measurement was limited by the thermoelastic effect@xcite .",
    "since the thermoelastic effect of the sapphire fiber is negligibly small in cryogenic temperature , @xmath7 is expected to be higher for this measurement . to our knowledge",
    ", this paper represents the first cryogenic measurement of sapphire fiber q - factor .    in this letter",
    ", we show that the measured @xmath7 of the sapphire fiber at 6k was as high as that exhibited at room temperature by a fused silica fiber considered to be the highest q - factor fiber at room temperature .",
    "figure [ setup ] shows the experimental setup . we used a saphikon inc .",
    "sapphire fiber@xcite , 250@xmath9 m in diameter , the same as used in previous experiments@xcite .",
    "the whole assembly was housed in a vacuum chamber at @xmath10pa .",
    "the vacuum chamber was immersed in liquid helium in a top - loading cryostat .",
    "the whole assembly was cooled by heat conduction through three copper rods from the top flange of the vacuum chamber .    to measure @xmath7 ,",
    "the ring - down method was used .",
    "a pzt vibrator excited the bending motion of the sapphire fiber . damping time of the oscillation was measured by a shadow sensor consisting of an infrared light - emitting diode ( ir led ) and an ingaas photo diode .",
    "the ir led was set on the back side of a clamp .",
    "the oscillating sapphire fiber cast a shadow on the surface of the photo diode with the size of the shadow changing with the vibration amplitude .",
    "figure [ example ] shows the amplitude decay in a typical measurement .",
    "we used a pair of the sapphire blocks@xcite of 5 mm in thickness for clamping the sapphire fiber .",
    "when the sapphire fiber was clamped with soft metal plates , grooves were formed on the plates and the groove could cause excess loss .",
    "the clamp had two slots .",
    "one slot was used for clamping the sapphire fiber and the other slot was for setting a pzt vibrator as a continuous exciter .",
    "the sapphire fiber was mounted between the sapphire blocks and fastened by a m4 aluminum screw with a torque of 50n@xmath11 cm .    to obtain the @xmath7 of other frequency modes",
    ", we cut the free end of the clamped sapphire fiber without loosening the clamp and re - measured @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the clamping condition remained unchanged for the whole measurement .",
    "we found two resonances whose frequencies were separated by about 3% for each length of the fiber .",
    "this frequency split may be due to come from an imperfection circular cross section of the sapphire fiber . in this paper",
    ", we distinguish these resonances by their resonant frequencies and refer to them as `` higher resonance '' and `` lower resonance '' .",
    "figure [ result_n2 ] and figure [ result_he ] show the frequency dependence of the @xmath7 at 78k and 6k , respectively .",
    "the length of the sapphire fiber , the measured resonant frequencies and @xmath7 are summarized in table [ resonantfreq_low : ta ] and [ resonantfreq_high : ta ] . when the sapphire fibers are applied to lcgt as mirror suspension fibers , temperature at clamping points of the sapphire fibers is designed to be lower than 10k .",
    "thus , the 6k results of @xmath7 have more importance to lcgt .",
    "the result of @xmath7 at 6k shows a frequency dependence .",
    "estimated @xmath12 due to the thermoelastic effect of the sapphire fiber at 200hz was @xmath13 , much smaller than the measured value .",
    "although the major dissipation mechanisms have not yet been identified in our measurement , a combination of the sapphire fiber and the clamp using the sapphire blocks has achieved a high @xmath7 of more than @xmath14 , comparable with @xmath7 of fused silica fiber@xcite .    for estimating the thermal vibration of the pendulum",
    ", we took @xmath7 of @xmath15 which is an averaged value of the results at 6k at the lowest frequency ( 192hz and 199hz ) . assuming the structure damping model , the value of @xmath7 at 199hz can be extrapolated to the frequency region below 100hz where the pendulum thermal noise is a dominant noise source of the detector .",
    "@xmath6 of the cryogenic mirror suspension is obtained through the dissipation dilution theorem@xcite . a brief review of the dissipation dilution theorem can be found in an appendix to this letter ."
