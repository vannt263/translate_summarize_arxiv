    "recently , high resolution x - ray images using _ chandra _ have revealed 49 point sources in the antennae @xcite . we will assume a distance to the antennae of 19.3 mpc ( for @xmath16=75 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 ) , which implies 10 sources have x - ray luminosities greater than @xmath18 ergs s@xmath17 .",
    "considering new observations of red giant stars in the antennae indicate a distance of 13.8 mpc @xcite , we point out this ultraluminous x - ray source population could decrease by roughly a half",
    ". typically , masses of black holes produced from standard stellar evolution are less than @xmath19 @xmath20 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the eddington luminosity limit implies that x - ray luminosities @xmath21 ergs s@xmath17 correspond to higher - mass objects not formed from a typical star .",
    "several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest these massive ( @xmath22 @xmath23 ) compact sources outside galactic nuclei are intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) , a new class of bhs . while imbhs could potentially explain the observed high luminosities , other theories exist as well , including beamed radiation from a stellar mass bh @xcite ; super - eddington accretion onto lower - mass objects ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; or supernovae exploding in dense environments @xcite .",
    "compact objects tend to be associated with massive star formation , which is strongly suspected to be concentrated in young stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "massive stars usually end their lives in supernovae , producing a compact remnant .",
    "this remnant can be kicked out of the cluster due to dynamical interactions , stay behind after the cluster evaporates , or remain embedded in its central regions .",
    "this last case is of particular interest to us as the compact object is still _ in situ _ , allowing us to investigate its origins via the ambient cluster population .",
    "the potential for finding such associations is large in the antennae due to large numbers of both x - ray point sources and super star clusters ; a further incentive for studying these galaxies .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth paper i ) we presented @xmath0 and @xmath2 photometry of @xmath24 clusters in the antennae .",
    "analysis of ( @xmath25 ) colors indicated that many clusters in the overlap region suffer from 910 mag of extinction in the @xmath26-band .",
    "this result contrasts with previous work by @xcite who associated optical sources with radio counterparts in the antennae @xcite and argued that extinction is not large in this system .",
    "here , we continue our analysis of these antennae ir images by making a frame - tie between the ir and _ chandra _ x - ray images from @xcite . utilizing the similar dust - penetrating properties of these wavelengths , we demonstrate the power of this approach to finding counterparts to x - ray sources . by comparing the photometric properties of clusters with and without x - ray counterparts , we seek to understand the cluster environments of these x - ray sources . in  2 we discuss the ir observations of the antennae .",
    " 3 explains our matching technique and the photometric properties of the ir counterparts .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results in  4 .",
    "we obtained near - infrared images of ngc 4038/9 on 2002 march 22 using the wide - field infrared camera ( wirc ) on the palomar 5-m telescope . at the time of these observations ,",
    "wirc had been commissioned with an under - sized hawaii-1 array ( prior to installation of the full - sized hawaii-2 array in september 2002 ) , providing a @xmath27-arcminute field of view with @xmath28 pixels ( `` wirc-1k ''  see @xcite for details ) .",
    "conditions were non - photometric due to patches of cloud passing through",
    ". typical seeing - limited images had stellar full - width at half - maximum of @xmath8 in @xmath2 and @xmath29 in @xmath0 .",
    "we obtained images in both the @xmath0- ( @xmath30 m ) and @xmath2-band ( @xmath31 m ) independently .",
    "the details of the processing used to obtain the final images are given in paper 1 .",
    "the relative astrometry between the x - ray sources in ngc 4038/9 and images at other wavelengths is crucial for successful identification of multi - wavelength counterparts .",
    "previous attempts at this have suffered from the crowded nature of the field and confusion between potential counterparts @xcite .",
    "however , the infrared waveband offers much better hopes for resolving this issue , due to the similar dust - penetrating properties of photons in the _ chandra _ and @xmath2 bands .",
    "( see also @xcite for a comparison of ir extinction to the previous optical / radio extinction work of @xcite . )",
    "we thus proceeded using the infrared images to establish an astrometric frame - tie , i.e. matching _ chandra _ coordinates to ir pixel positions .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite , we must take care when searching for x - ray source counterparts in crowded regions such as the antennae .",
    "therefore , our astrometric frame - tie used a unique approach based on solving a two - dimensional linear mapping function relating right ascension and declination coordinates in one image with x and y pixel positions in a second image .",
    "the solution is of the form :    @xmath32    here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the right ascension and declination , respectively , for a single source in one frame corresponding to the @xmath35 and @xmath36 pixel positions in another frame .",
    "this function considers both the offset and rotation between each frame .",
    "since we are interested in solving for the coefficients @xmath37@xmath38 , elementary linear algebra indicates we need six equations or three separate matches .",
    "therefore , we need at least three matches to fully describe the rms positional uncertainty of the frame - tie .",
    "we first used the above method to derive an approximate astrometric solution for the wirc @xmath2 image utilizing the presence of six relatively bright , compact ir sources which are also present in images from the 2-micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "we calculated pixel centroids of these objects in both the 2mass and wirc images , and used the 2mass astrometric header information to convert the 2mass pixel centroids into ra and dec .",
    "these sources are listed in table 1 . applying these six matches to our fitting function",
    "we found a small rms positional uncertainty of @xmath39 , which demonstrates an accurate frame - tie between the 2mass and wirc images .    using the 2mass astrometric solution as a baseline",
    ", we identified seven clear matches between _",
    "chandra _ and wirc sources , which had bright compact ir counterparts with no potentially confusing sources nearby ( listed in table 2 ) .",
    "we then applied the procedure described above , using the _ chandra _ coordinates listed in table 1 of @xcite ( see that reference for details on the _ chandra _ astrometry ) and the wirc pixel centroids , and derived the astrometric solution for the ir images in the x - ray coordinate frame .",
    "for the 7 matches , we find an rms residual positional uncertainty of @xmath40 which we adopt as our @xmath41 position uncertainty .",
    "we note that the positional uncertainty is an entirely _ empirical _ quantity .",
    "it shows the achieved uncertainty in mapping a target from one image reference frame to the reference frame in another band , and automatically incorporates all contributing sources of uncertainty in it .",
    "these include , but are not limited to , systematic uncertainties ( i.e. field distortion , psf variation , etc . in both _",
    "chandra _ and wirc ) and random uncertainties ( i.e. centroid shifts induced by photon noise , flatfield noise , etc . in both _",
    "chandra _ and wirc ) .",
    "thus , given the empirical nature of this uncertainty , we expect it to provide a robust measure of the actual mapping error  an expectation which seems to be borne out by the counterpart identification in the following section .    to further test the accuracy of our astrometric solution we explored the range in rms positional uncertainties for several different frame - ties .",
    "specifically we picked ten ir / x - ray matches separated by @xmath421@xmath43 , which are listed in table 3 ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "of these ten we chose 24 different combinations of seven matches resulting in 24 unique frame - ties .",
    "computing the rms positional uncertainty for each we found a mean of 0@xmath444 with a 1@xmath45 uncertainty of 0@xmath441 . considering the rms positional uncertainty for the frame - tie used in our analysis",
    "falls within 1@xmath45 of this mean rms , this indicates we made an accurate astrometric match between the ir and x - ray .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on 222 clusters in the @xmath0-band and 221 clusters in the @xmath2-band ( see also paper 1 ) .",
    "we found that the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) was 3.5 pixels ( @xmath46 ) in the @xmath2 image and 4.6 pixels ( @xmath47 ) in the @xmath0 band .",
    "we used a photometric aperture of 5-pixel radius in @xmath2 band , and 6-pixel radius in @xmath0 band , corresponding to @xmath48 of the gaussian psf .",
    "background subtraction is both very important and very difficult in an environment such as the antennae due to the brightness and complex structure of the underlying galaxies and the plethora of nearby clusters . in order to address the uncertainties in background subtraction",
    ", we measured the background in two separate annuli around each source : one from 9 to 12 pixels and another from 12 to 15 pixels .",
    "due to the high concentration of clusters , crowding became an issue . to circumvent this problem , we employed the use of sky background arcs instead of annuli for some sources .",
    "these were defined by a position angle and opening angle with respect to the source center .",
    "all radii were kept constant to ensure consistency .",
    "in addition , nearby bright sources could shift the computed central peak position by as much as a pixel or two .",
    "if the centroid position determined for a given source differed significantly ( @xmath49 pixel ) from the apparent brightness peak due to such contamination , we forced the center of all photometric apertures to be at the apparent brightness peak .",
    "for both annular regions , we calculated the mean and median backgrounds per pixel .    multiplying these by the area of the central aperture , these values were subtracted from the flux measurement of the central aperture to yield 4 flux values for the source in terms of dn .",
    "averaging these four values provided us with a flux value for each cluster .",
    "we computed errors by considering both variations in sky background , @xmath50 , and poisson noise , @xmath51 .",
    "we computed @xmath50 by taking the standard deviation of the four measured flux values .",
    "we then calculated the expected poisson noise by scaling dn to @xmath52 using the known gain of wirc ( 2 @xmath53 dn@xmath17 , * ? ? ? * ) and taking the square root of this value .",
    "we added both terms in quadrature to find the total estimated error in photometry .",
    "we then calibrated our photometry using the bright 2mass star in table 1 .",
    "we used the astrometric frame - tie described above to identify ir counterpart candidates to _ chandra _ x - ray sources in the wirc @xmath2 image .",
    "we restricted our analysis to sources brighter than @xmath54 mag .",
    "this is our @xmath2 sensitivity limit which we define in our photometric analysis below ( see  3.2.1 ) . using the @xmath55 rms positional uncertainty of our frame - tie , we defined circles with 2@xmath45 and 3@xmath45 radii around each _ chandra _ x - ray source where we searched for ir counterparts ( figure 1 ) .",
    "if an ir source lay within a @xmath8 radius ( @xmath56 ) of an x - ray source , we labeled these counterparts as `` strong '' . those ir sources between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath57 ) from an x - ray source we labeled as `` possible '' counterparts .",
    "we found a total of 13 strong and 6 possible counterparts to x - ray sources in the antennae .",
    "these sources are listed in table 3 and shown in figure 3 .",
    "of the 19 x - ray sources with counterparts , two are the nuclei @xcite , one is a background quasar @xcite , and two share the same ir counterpart .",
    "therefore , in our analysis of cluster properties , we only consider the 15 ir counterparts that are clusters .",
    "( while x-42 has two ir counterparts , we chose the closer , fainter cluster for our analysis . )",
    "we then attempted to estimate the level of `` contamination '' of these samples due to chance superposition of unrelated x - ray sources and ir clusters .",
    "this estimation can be significantly complicated by the complex structure and non - uniform distribution of both x - ray sources and ir clusters in the antennae , so we developed a simple , practical approach .",
    "given the @xmath58 rms residuals in our relative astrometry for sources in table 2 , we assume that any ir clusters lying in a background annulus with radial size of @xmath59@xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) centered on all x - ray source positions are chance alignments , with no real physical connection ( see figure 1 ) . dividing the total number of ir sources within the background annuli of the 49 x - ray source positions by the total area of these annuli , we find a background ir source surface density of 0.02 arcsecond@xmath62 near _ chandra _ x - ray sources . multiplying this surface density by the total area of all `` strong '' regions ( @xmath8 radius circles ) and `` possible '' regions ( @xmath8  @xmath9 annuli ) around the 49 x - ray source positions , we estimated the level of source contamination contributing to our `` strong '' and `` possible '' ir counterpart candidates .",
    "we expect two with a @xmath63 uncertainty of + 0.2/-0.1 of the 13 `` strong '' counterparts to be due to chance superpositions , and three with a @xmath63 uncertainty of + 0.5/-0.3of the six `` possible '' counterparts to be chance superpositions .",
    "this result has several important implications .",
    "first of all , it is clear that we have a significant excess of ir counterparts within @xmath8 of the x - ray sources  13 , where we expect only two in the null hypothesis of no physical counterparts . even including the `` possible '' counterparts out to @xmath9",
    ", we have a total of 19 counterparts , where we expect only five from chance superposition .",
    "secondly , this implies that for any given `` strong '' ir counterpart , we have a probability of @xmath64 85% ( @xmath65 with a @xmath63 uncertainty of 0.3 ) that the association with an x - ray source is real . even for the `` possible '' counterparts , the probability of true association is @xmath6450% .",
    "these levels of certainty are a tremendous improvement over the x - ray / optical associations provided by @xcite , and are strong motivators for follow - up multi - wavelength studies of the ir counterparts .",
    "finally , we can also conclude from strong concentration of ir counterparts within @xmath66 of x - ray sources that the frame tie uncertainty estimates described above are reasonable .",
    "figure 2 is a @xmath67 @xmath2 image of the antennae with x - ray source positions overlaid .",
    "we designate those x - ray sources with counterparts using red circles .",
    "notice that those sources with counterparts lie in the spiral arms and bridge region of the antennae .",
    "since these regions are abundant in star formation , this seems to indicate many of the x - ray sources in the antennae are tied to star formation in these galaxies .",
    "using the 219 clusters that had both @xmath0 and @xmath2 photometry , we made @xmath68 versus @xmath2 color magnitude diagrams ( figure 4 ) .",
    "we estimated our sensitivity limit by first finding all clusters with signal - to - noise @xmath69 .",
    "the mean @xmath0 and @xmath2 magnitudes for these clusters were computed separately and defined as cutoff values for statistical analyzes .",
    "this yielded 19.0 mag in @xmath0 and 19.4 mag in @xmath2 .",
    "we note that the x - ray clusters are generally bright in the ir compared to the general population of clusters .",
    "while the ir counterpart for one x - ray source ( x-32 ) falls below our @xmath0-band sensitivity limit , its @xmath2 magnitude is still above our @xmath2 cutoff .",
    "therefore , we retained this source in our analysis .",
    "we then broke down the x - ray sources into three luminosity classes ( figure 4 ) .",
    "we took the absorption - corrected x - ray luminosities , @xmath70 , as listed in table 1 of @xcite for all sources of interest .",
    "these luminosities assumed a distance to the antennae of 29 mpc .",
    "we used 19.3 mpc ( for @xmath16=75 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 ) instead and so divided these values by 2.25 as suggested in @xcite .",
    "we defined the three x - ray luminosities as follows : low luminosity x - ray sources ( llx s ) had @xmath71 @xmath42 3@xmath72@xmath73 ergs s@xmath17 , high luminosity x - ray sources ( hlx s ) were between @xmath71 of 3@xmath74ergs s@xmath17 and 1@xmath75 ergs s@xmath17 , while @xmath71 @xmath13 1@xmath75 ergs s@xmath17 were ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulx s ) . in figure 4 we designate each ir counterpart according to the luminosity class of its corresponding x - ray source .",
    "there does not appear to be a noticeable trend in the ir cluster counterparts between these different groupings .",
    "to further study the properties of these ir counterparts , we calculated @xmath76 for all ir clusters .",
    "we calculated reddening using the observed colors , @xmath77 , ( hence forth the `` color method '' ) .",
    "assuming all clusters are dominated by o and b stars , their intrinsic @xmath68 colors are @xmath640.2 mag . approximating this value as 0 mag , this allowed us to estimate @xmath78 as @xmath79 @xmath77/1.33 using the extinction law defined in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ccm ) .",
    "since these derived reddenings are biased towards young clusters , they will lead to an overestimate of @xmath76 for older clusters .    for ir counterparts to x - ray sources",
    ", we also computed x - ray - estimated @xmath78 using the column densities , @xmath80 , listed in table 5 of @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath80 is derived by fitting both a power law ( pl ) and raymond - smith ( rs * ? ? ?",
    "* ) model to the x - ray spectra . using the ccm law ,",
    "@xmath78 is defined as 0.12@xmath81 .",
    "taking @xmath81 = @xmath82 mag @xmath83 @xmath80 , we could then derive @xmath78 .",
    "then we compared @xmath78 calculated using the `` color method '' to @xmath78 found using the above two @xmath80 models .",
    "we found the `` color method '' matched closest to @xmath84 for all except one ( the cluster associated with _",
    "chandra _ source 32 as designated in @xcite ) .    in figure 5 , we plot histograms of the distribution of @xmath2-band luminosity , @xmath76 .",
    "figure 5 displays all clusters as well as over plotting only those with x - ray counterparts .",
    "notice that the clusters with associated x - ray sources look more luminous . to study whether this apparent trend in luminosity is real , we compared these two distributions using a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test . in our analysis",
    ", we only included clusters below @xmath76 @xmath42 -13.2 mag .",
    "restricting our study to sources with `` good '' photometry , we first defined a limit in @xmath2 , 18.2 mag , using the limiting @xmath0 magnitude , 19.0 mag as stated above , and , since the limit in @xmath2 is a function of cluster color , the median @xmath68 of 0.8 mag . subtracting the distance modulus to the antennae ,",
    "31.4 mag , from this @xmath2 limit , we computed our cutoff in @xmath76 .",
    "since all clusters with x - ray sources fall below this cutoff , our subsample is sufficient to perform a statistical comparison .",
    "the ks test yielded a d - statistic of 0.37 with a probability of @xmath85 that the two distributions of clusters with and without associated x - ray sources are related . considering the separate cluster populations as two probability distributions ,",
    "each can be expressed as a cumulative distribution .",
    "the d - statistic is then the absolute value of the maximum difference between each cumulative distribution .",
    "this test indicates that those clusters with x - ray counterparts are more luminous than most clusters in the antennae .",
    "@xcite found 70% of the bright clusters observed with the _ hubble space telescope _ have ages @xmath4220 myr .",
    "therefore , in this study we will assume all clusters are typically the same age , @xmath6420 myr .",
    "this allows us to make the simplifying assumption that cluster mass is proportional to luminosity and ask : does the cluster mass affect the propensity for a given progenitor star to produce an x - ray binary ? we estimated cluster mass using @xmath2 luminosity ( @xmath76 ) . since cluster mass increases linearly with flux ( for an assumed constant age of all clusters ) , we converted @xmath76 to flux . using the data as binned in the @xmath76 histogram ( figure 5 )",
    ", we calculated an average flux per bin . by computing the fraction of number of clusters per average flux ,",
    "we are in essence asking what is the probability of finding a cluster with a specific mass .",
    "since those clusters with x - ray sources are more luminous , we expect a higher probability of finding an x - ray source in a more massive cluster .",
    "as seen in figure 6 , this trend does seem to be true . applying a ks - test between the distributions for all clusters and those associated with x - ray sources for clusters below the @xmath76 completeness limit defined in the previous section ,",
    "we find a d - statistic of 0.66 and a probability of @xmath86 that they are the same .",
    "hence , the two distributions are distinct , indicating it is statistically significant that more massive clusters tend to contain x - ray sources .",
    "while we assume all clusters are @xmath6420 myr above , we note that the actual range in ages is @xmath641100 myr @xcite .",
    "bruzual - charlot spectral photometric models @xcite indicate that clusters in this age range could vary by a factor of roughly 100 in mass for a given @xmath2 luminosity .",
    "thus , we emphasize that the analysis above should be taken as suggestive rather than conclusive evidence , and note that in a future paper ( clark , et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) we explore this line of investigation and the impacts of age variations on the result in depth .",
    "to assess whether our counterpart detections were dependent of reddening or their intrinsic brightness , we found limiting values for @xmath76 for those x - ray sources without detected ir counterparts .",
    "we achieved this by setting all clusters @xmath2 magnitudes equal to our completeness limit defined for the cmds ( 19.4 mag ; see  3.2.1 ) and then finding @xmath87 for each using @xmath78 calculated for that cluster . since @xmath87 is theoretical and only depends on reddening , we could now find this limit for all x - ray sources using an @xmath78 estimated from the observed @xmath80 values .",
    "thus we considered all ir counterparts ( detections ) and those x - ray sources without a counterpart ( nondetections ) .",
    "if nondetections are due to reddening there should not exist a difference in @xmath87 between detections and nondetections .",
    "in contrast , if nondetections are intrinsically fainter , we expect a higher @xmath87 for these sources . in the case of detections",
    ", we considered reddening from both the `` color method '' and the @xmath84 separately .",
    "we could only derive nondetections using @xmath84 reddening .",
    "figure 7 shows @xmath87 appears higher for all nondetections . to test",
    "if this observation is significant , we applied a ks - test to investigate whether detections and nondetections are separate distributions .",
    "we find a d - statistic of 0.82 and probability of @xmath88 that these two distributions are the same using the `` color method '' for detections .",
    "considering the @xmath84 reddening method for detections instead , the d - statistic drops to 0.48 and the probability increases to @xmath89 .",
    "since both tests indicate these distributions are distinct , the observed high @xmath87 for nondetections seems to be real .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that these sources were undetected because they are intrinsically ir - faint , and that reddening does not play the dominant role in nondetections .",
    "we summarize these statistics in table 4 .",
    "here we calculated the mean @xmath2 , @xmath68 , and @xmath76 for three different categories : 1 ) all clusters , 2 ) clusters only connected with x - ray sources , and 3 ) these clusters broken down by luminosity class .",
    "we also include uncertainties in each quantity .",
    "notice that the ir counterparts appear brighter in @xmath2 and intrinsically more luminous than most clusters in the antennae , although there is no significant trend in color .",
    "we also summarize the above ks - test results in table 5 .",
    "we have demonstrated a successful method for finding counterparts to x - ray sources in the antennae using ir wavelengths .",
    "we mapped _",
    "chandra _ x - ray coordinates to wirc pixel positions with a positional uncertainty of @xmath90 . using this precise frame - tie we found 13 `` strong '' matches ( @xmath91 separation ) and 5 `` possible '' matches ( @xmath92 separation ) between x - ray sources and ir counterparts . after performing a spatial and photometric analysis of these counterparts",
    ", we reached the following conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "we expect only 2 of the 13 `` strong '' ir counterparts to be chance superpositions . including all 19 ir counterparts",

    "clearly , a large majority of the x - ray / ir associations are real .",
    "the ir counterparts tend to reside in the spiral arms and bridge region between these interacting galaxies .",

    "<S> based on a detailed study of the surface density of ir sources near the x - ray sources , we expect only @xmath10 of the `` strong '' counterparts and @xmath11 of the `` possible '' counterparts to be chance superpositions of unrelated objects .    </S>",
    "<S> comparing both strong and possible ir counterparts to our photometric study of @xmath12 ir clusters in the antennae , we find with a @xmath13 99.9% confidence level that ir counterparts to x - ray sources are @xmath14 mag more luminous than average non - x - ray clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the x - ray / ir matches are concentrated in the spiral arms and `` overlap '' regions of the antennae . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that these x - ray sources lie in the most `` super '' of the antennae s super star clusters , and thus trace the recent massive star formation history here . </S>",
    "<S> based on the @xmath15 inferred from the x - ray sources without ir counterparts , we determine that the absence of most of the `` missing '' ir counterparts .. / .. / .. /astro - ph/ is not due to extinction , but that these sources are intrinsically less luminous in the ir , implying that they trace a different ( possibly older ) stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> we find no clear correlation between x - ray luminosity classes and ir properties of the sources , though small - number statistics hamper this analysis . </S>"
