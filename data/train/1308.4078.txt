    "consider a self - adjoint integral operator @xmath0 in the space @xmath4 on a domain or a manifold @xmath5 provided with a finite measure @xmath6 .",
    "if its integral kernel @xmath1 is continuous then the operator is compact and its spectrum consists of eigenvalues accumulating to zero .",
    "such operators have been considered by many authors , most of whom studied the rate of convergence of eigenvalues and obtained various quantitative versions of the following general statement : _ the smoother the kernel is , the faster the eigenvalues tend to zero _",
    "( see , for instance , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the paper deals with a different , seemingly simple question : _ how many negative eigenvalues are there ? _ more precisely , we are interested in obtaining explicit lower bounds for the number of negative eigenvalues in terms of the integral kernel @xmath1 .    one can argue that in the generic case the dimensions of positive and negative eigenspaces must be the same , so that both of them are infinite dimensional and there are infinitely many negative eigenvalues . however , this argument is of little use when we need to study a particular integral operator .    it is not immediately clear what properties of @xmath1 guarantee that there are many negative eigenvalues .",
    "the fact that @xmath1 is real and negative on a large set is clearly insufficient ( for instance , the operator with constant integral kernel @xmath7 has only one negative eigenvalue ) . on the positive side , if @xmath1 takes large negative values on the diagonal and the hilbert ",
    "schmidt norm of @xmath0 is relatively small , one can estimate the number of its negative eigenvalues as follows .",
    "let @xmath8 . if @xmath9 then the number of negative eigenvalues of the operator @xmath0 is not smaller than @xmath10 indeed , if @xmath11 is the truncation of @xmath0 to the subspace @xmath12 then @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 stand for the trace and the hilbert ",
    "schmidt norm . since @xmath16",
    ", we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the negative eigenvalues of @xmath11 .",
    "thus @xmath19 estimates the number of negative eigenvalues of @xmath11 and , consequently , of @xmath0 from below .",
    "the main result of the paper is theorem [ t : integral ] which provides a similar estimate involving some integrals of @xmath1 . unlike in the previous example",
    ", it does not rely only on the behaviour of @xmath1 on the diagonal and takes into account the contribution of its off - diagonal part .",
    "theorem [ t : integral ] is stated and proved in section [ s : main ] .",
    "it is formulated in a very general setting but even in the simplest situation ( say , for integral operators on a line segment ) the result is not obvious .",
    "section [ s : examples ] contains some comments and examples .",
    "in particular , in subsection [ s : dn ] we discuss the link between the problems of estimating the number of negative eigenvalues and the difference between the dirichlet and neumann counting functions of the laplace operator on a domain .",

    "therefore @xmath89 and , consequently , there exists a point @xmath90 such that @xmath91    since @xmath92 continuously depends on @xmath93 and every open set contains infinitely many elements , for each @xmath94 there exists a point @xmath95 such that @xmath96 and all the entries @xmath97 and @xmath98 are distinct .",
    "the estimate implies that the number of eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath99 lying in the interval @xmath100 does not exceed @xmath101 .",

    "let @xmath114 and @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the characteristic functions of the sets @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "then @xmath120 and @xmath121    let us choose the neighbourhoods @xmath118 and @xmath119 so small that all the functions @xmath122 and @xmath123 have disjoint supports , and let @xmath124 be the contraction of @xmath0 to the @xmath125-dimensional subspace spanned by these functions .",
    "in view of , in the basis @xmath126 the operator @xmath124 is represented by a @xmath59-matrix that converges to @xmath127 as @xmath128 . consequently , @xmath129 for all sufficiently small @xmath130 . by the variational principle ,",

    "the estimate implies that @xmath0 has at least one eigenvalue below a negative @xmath137 whenever @xmath138 .",
    "indeed , in this case with any symmetric measure @xmath139 satisfying * ( c@xmath52 ) * shows that @xmath140 .",
    "since the function @xmath131 is integer - valued , it follows that @xmath141 .    if @xmath142 then implies only the obvious estimate @xmath141 . in order to obtain a better result",
    ", one has to increase the constant @xmath84 by choosing an appropriate measure @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , theorem [ t : integral ] gives a good estimate when the function @xmath32 is takes large negative values on a `` thin '' subset @xmath143 , the measure @xmath41 is supported on @xmath144 and @xmath145 is relatively small outside a neighbourhood of @xmath144 . on the contrary , if @xmath1 is almost constant on @xmath36 then @xmath146 and @xmath147 .    a possible strategy of optimizing the choice of @xmath139 is to fix the marginal @xmath148 and to maximize @xmath149 over the set of symmetric measures @xmath139 with the fixed marginal .",
