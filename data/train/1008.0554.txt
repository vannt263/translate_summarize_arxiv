    "there are more and more astrophysical observations justifying the existence of extremely compact massive objects with size close to their schwarzschild radius @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that these observations also provide indirect justifications of the existence of black holes ( bhs ) . nevertheless , there are also alternative ideas about claiming that exotic states of matter may exist which could stabilize extremely compact stars suiting to the aforementioned astrophysical observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "one of the most popular among these types of bh mimicking objects is the gravitational vacuum star ( gravastar ) model which has received considerable attention not least because its relation to the concept of dark energy . in this model of mazur and mottola @xcite an interior de sitter spacetime region is connected via three intermediate layers to an outer schwarzschild solution such that the radius of the outermost layer is supposed to be slightly larger than the schwarzschild radius of the system .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in advance to the gravastar model there were several constructions in which the matching of a de sitter region to the schwarzschild spacetime was applied .",
    "for instance , to get rid of the @xmath0 singularity of the schwarzschild spacetime , frolov , markov and mukhanov in @xcite proposed a matching of a de sitter interior to it at a small radius of the planck scale ensuring thereby that the curvature remains bounded everywhere in the yielded spacetime .",
    "dynamical investigation of this model was already carried out in @xcite .",
    "note that up to certain extent the model used in @xcite could be considered as the precursor of the gravastar model ",
    "although in the latter the matching was made in a more elaborated way  and the outermost matching surface , at the boundary of the schwarzschild region , was supposed to be arranged such that its radius is slightly larger than the pertinent schwarzschild radius .",
    "once such a model is set up the following questions manifest themselves :    * what type of physical process may produce such a gravastar ?",
    "* is a gravastar stable ? * if it is , does it provide a viable alternative to bhs ?",
    "while the first question has not been tackled yet even the second question turned out to be too complex within the original model of mazur and mottola  although in @xcite an argument claiming for its thermodynamical stability was given  as it is composed by making use of three different types of regions with unspecified matter . to reduce the related ambiguities visser and wiltshire @xcite introduced a simplified three - layer gravastar model where the interior de sitter region is matched to the exterior schwarzschild spacetime via a single matter shell .",
    "this model is simple enough to carry out various analytic investigations by making use of the thin - shell formalism of israel @xcite .",
    "visser and wiltshire besides deriving the basic relations determining the evolution of gravastars also carried out the first investigation of their radial stability .",
    "since then the stability of gravastars has been studied by several authors within this simplified model or within its continuum correspondence @xcite .",
    "results relevant for radial stability can be found in @xcite , and in case of electrically charged gravastars in @xcite .",
    "the stability has also been investigated with respect to axial perturbations @xcite .    in all of these investigations attention",
    "was restricted to the space of gravastars in equilibrium , i.e. the radial stability was investigated by determining the response of a gravastar to a slight formal change of the underlying effective potential . for instance , in @xcite the excursions of gravastars was investigated in such a way that their evolution started with carefully prepared initial conditions . in all of the pertinent investigations it was demonstrated that by suitably adjusting the equation of state ( eos ) of the matter forming the surface of the gravastar the subspace of ` stable ' gravastars may always be ensured to be of non - zero measure . nevertheless , it was also found that whenever the measure of the subspaces of the configuration space representing stable and unstable gravastars is compared the former is always found to be negligible with respect to the latter .",
    "this observation was commonly interpreted that gravastars may not offer a viable alternative to bhs .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to determine the response of a gravastar in equilibrium to the arrival of a dust shell onto its surface .",
    "this is done not merely by considering some formal change of the effective potential determining the state of a gravastar but also by making use of the full dynamical setup . for the sake of definiteness",
    ", we assume that the surface of the gravastar and the dust shell collide in a totally inelastic manner .",
    "in addition , concrete eoss are chosen and it is assumed that the dominant energy condition ( dec ) holds and the speed of sound in the surface of the gravastar does not exceed that of the light",
    ". then the relevant non - linear problems  the basic equations of which are based on the dynamics of spherical shells  are solved by using analytical and numerical approaches . in this way we can not only study the excursion of particular gravastar models but",
    "also determine the maximal mass of the dust shell colliding with the surface of the gravastar without converting the latter into a bh .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ visser - model ]",
    "some of the basics of the visser and wiltshire three - layer dynamics gravastar model are recalled using dimensionless variables . as a preparation for the aforementioned dynamical investigations a short survey of the configuration space of stable gravastars is also provided .",
    "( although there are no completely new results in this section , we believe that this review provides a good reference frame for the results of the succeeding dynamical investigations . ) in section [ collision - section ] the dynamics of the system composed by the spherically symmetric dust shell falling onto a stable gravastar , along with their collision , is described .",
    "section [ results ] reports about our analytical and numerical results concerning the dynamics of maximally loaded gravastars , while section [ conclusions ] contains our concluding remarks . finally , in the appendix , a generic description of the totally inelastic collision of spherical shells in spherically symmetric spacetimes is provided . throughout this paper the geometrized units , with @xmath1 , are applied .",
    "throughout this paper considerations will be restricted to the three - layer spherically symmetric gravastar model of visser and wiltshire @xcite . this simplified model",
    "consists of an external schwarzschild vacuum region with the mass parameter @xmath2 , representing the total adm mass of the gravastar , an interior de sitter region with energy density @xmath3 , and an infinitesimally thin shell at the mutual boundary of the aforementioned two regions at radius @xmath4 with surface energy density @xmath5 and surface tension @xmath6 .",
    "the line element representing the interior desitter and exterior schwarzschild spacetimes is given in the form of ( [ met1 ] ) and ( [ met2 ] ) , where the pertinent forms of @xmath7 are specified in the paragraph below ( [ met2 ] ) .",
    "note that the radius is allowed to vary in time . as the shell",
    "is assumed to coincide , at any moment , with one of the @xmath8 group orbits , the quantities characterizing the shell are only the functions of the radius . to have a closed system of equations governing the evolution of the shell we also need to assume the existence of an eos . as was noted above @xmath5 and @xmath6 must be functions of the radius exclusively .",
    "thereby , in virtue of the implicit function theorem , the eos , relating the tension , @xmath6 , of the surface to the mass density , @xmath5 , of the surface of the gravastar , may always be assumed to possess the form @xmath9 .",
    "this section , besides recalling the most important equations determining the dynamics , also provides a short comprehensive review of the basic properties of the above - outlined three - layer gravastar model .      in studying the gravastar model",
    "the use of the following dimensionless parameters turned out to be advantageous .",
    "they are the dimensionless radius @xmath10 , surface density @xmath11 , tension @xmath12 and the dimensionless de sitter density parameter , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "the systems degenerates to a shell moving in a minkowski - schwarzschild spacetime . ]",
    "note that in the chosen setup positive tangential pressure does correspond to negative surface tension . to avoid the appearance of the event horizon in the schwarzschild region the inequality @xmath15",
    "is required to be satisfied .",
    "similarly , in order to exclude the presence of a ` cosmological ' horizon in the de sitter region the inequality @xmath16 is imposed . accordingly , in case of the considered gravastar models the value of @xmath17 is restricted to the interval @xmath18 .",
    "finally note that in dynamical situations the time dependence may conveniently be expressed via the dimensionless proper time measured by observers moving radially along the world - sheet of the shell , in @xmath19 units .",
    "the basic equations determining the dynamics of the shell of the gravastar can be derived in various ways .",
    "the most widely applied method uses the thin - shell formalism of israel @xcite based on the results given by sen , lanczos , darmois @xcite . in this approach",
    "the induced metrics , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , on the mutual boundary of the two spacetime regions  the inner and the outer  on the two sides of the shell are assumed to coincide , i.e. the metric on the shell can be given as @xmath22 , while the discontinuity of the pertinent extrinsic curvature tensors , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are related to the surface ",
    "energy density @xmath25 via the matching condition    @xmath26    by making use of the pertinent results of @xcite , along with the above - introduced parameterization , these junction conditions can be seen to take the form    @xmath27    where the over - dot denotes the derivative with respect to the dimensionless proper time along the shell .    as the energy density of the shell",
    "is always assumed to be non - negative , the first square root on the left - hand side of ( [ sigma - dyn ] ) must be greater than the second one , which implies that @xmath28 .",
    "note that this restriction , viewed as a condition on the value of @xmath29 , is more demanding than the previous one excluding the presence of a cosmological horizon in the inner de sitter region . in virtue of ( [ sigma - dyn ] )",
    "it is straightforward to see that whenever @xmath30 is non - negative it attains its maximum value for vanishing @xmath31 for any fixed value of @xmath29 .    in describing the dynamics of gravastars it turned out to be advantageous to introduce an",
    "` effective potential ' defined via the relation    @xmath32    assuming that @xmath30 is positive , by a straightforward algebraic manipulation , one finds that @xmath33 can be given as a function of @xmath29 and @xmath34it also depends on the dimensionless de sitter density parameter @xmath17and it reads    @xmath35 \\ , , \\ ] ]    which , in virtue of ( [ eqv])despite its complicated analytic form  has to be smaller than or equal to zero .",
    "once @xmath30 is known as a function of the dimensionless radius , @xmath29 , so is @xmath36 , and , in turn , ( [ eqv ] ) can be used to determine the motion of the shell .",
    "the next subsection shows that the eos of the shell , along with the conservation law , @xmath37where @xmath38 denotes the covariant derivative operator compatible with the metric , @xmath39 , on the shell  can be used to determine the functional form of @xmath40 .",
    "recall first that the eos of the surface matter of the gravastar , if given in terms of the dimensionless variables , may be assumed to possess the form @xmath41 .",
    "admittedly , the entire concept of an infinitesimally thin shell may be considered to be somewhat artificial .",
    "nevertheless , in our investigations we need to apply some assumptions on the type of its matter .",
    "the use of a suitable energy condition is essential . in this respect",
    "the use of the dec seems to be the most appropriate which is supposed to guarantee that the concept of causality is properly adopted in describing the evolution of coupled gravity matter systems .",
    "note that the less stringent weak and null energy conditions are automatically satisfied whenever the dec is guaranteed to hold .",
    "for an infinitesimally thin shell the dec can be seen to hold whenever @xmath42 @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    "the function @xmath41 will be assumed to be continuous and piecewise differentiable . to avoid dynamical instabilities we shall also assume that the square of the speed of sound , @xmath43 , is non - negative , and to be compatible with the concept of relativity that @xmath44 is required to be less than or equal to the square of the speed of light . accordingly ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , it will be assumed that @xmath45 .",
    "it is well - known that the radial conservation equation is    @xmath46    where @xmath47 denotes the dimensionless proper time along the radial trajectories generating the shell .",
    "( [ conserv ] ) may be derived either by referring the conservation law @xmath37 or by making use of equations ( [ sigma - dyn ] ) and ( [ theta - dyn ] ) as in @xcite . by introducing the dimensionless radius @xmath29 , instead of @xmath47 , as an independent variable ( [ conserv ] ) takes the form    @xmath48",
    "this is the very point where the eos of the shell comes into play since by substituting the relation @xmath41 into ( [ dsigma ] ) the functional form of @xmath34 can be determined .",
    "note that as @xmath49 , in virtue of ( [ dsigma ] ) , @xmath40 has to be a monotonic decreasing function .",
    "since ( [ dsigma ] ) is a separable differential equation , an implicit solution of it can be given as    @xmath50    where the integration constant @xmath51 is fixed such that @xmath52 .",
    "although latter @xmath53 will label equilibrium states , it should keep in mind that @xmath53 does not have such an interpretation yet . ]    to have some specific examples in later sections we shall use the following three types of eos .",
    "the simplest eos  that has been used in most of the former investigations of gravastars  is linear homogeneous possessing the functional form @xmath54 , which , however , is not satisfied for a generic linear functional relation . in this case @xmath55 and    @xmath56    clearly , it is of interest to consider more complex systems , as well .",
    "since @xmath57 is related to the speed of sound and its value at an equilibrium point will play an important role in the stability of the gravastar , it seems to be reasonable consider the eos with varying sound speed at the equilibrium point .",
    "the simplest generalization of a homogeneous linear eos would be the non - homogeneous linear one .",
    "however , we would also like to have the dec to hold which requires @xmath58 to vanish at @xmath59",
    ". therefore we use instead the ` broken linear ' eos    @xmath60    here the parameter @xmath61 signifies the value of the breaking point in the @xmath30 range , while for the values of the slopes , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , before and after the matching the inequalities @xmath64 hold . then ( [ general - eos ] ) can be evaluated explicitly . in doing",
    "so the dimensionless radius of the matching point @xmath65 , gets to be determined by the relation @xmath66 as    @xmath67    then , whenever @xmath68    @xmath69    while for @xmath70    @xmath71    another obvious choice is a polytrop eos .",
    "note , however , that in general a polytrop eos is supposed to relate the rest energy density @xmath72 , as opposed to the total energy density @xmath5 , to the pressure in which case it takes the functional form @xmath73 , with parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 . thereby , whenever we replace @xmath72 by @xmath5 the ` inverse form ' of the polytrop eos reads as ( see , e.g. , @xcite )    @xmath76    the solution of ( [ general - eos ] ) can be given explicitly as    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is related to the value of @xmath51 by ( [ polytrop ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the dec is satisfied if and only if @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "assume , now that if we are given both of the values @xmath51 and @xmath78 and the eos is chosen to possess the form ( [ polytrop ] ) then @xmath75 has to take value in the interval @xmath80 $ ] , where @xmath81 .",
    "then the square of initial speed of sound at @xmath51 can be given as @xmath82 .    in closing this subsection",
    "let us emphasize again that whenever an eos , @xmath41 , is chosen @xmath30 may be given as a function @xmath34 and , in virtue of ( [ v ] ) , the effective potential can be given as an explicit function @xmath83 depending exclusively on the dimensionless radius @xmath29 and the dimensionless de sitter density parameter @xmath17 .      in this subsection considerations",
    "will be restricted to the case of gravastars in equilibrium .",
    "equilibrium , as usual , signifies those configurations in rest for which forces are also balanced , i.e. @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath53 stands for the value of @xmath29 in equilibrium , while prime , @xmath86 , denotes derivative with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "as is expected the vanishing of @xmath33 and @xmath87 is equivalent to the vanishing of @xmath31 and @xmath88 , which can be verified by making use of ( [ eqv ] ) . in depicting of the configuration space of gravastars in equilibrium",
    "we shall apply the values @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which , by making use of ( [ sigma - dyn ] ) and ( [ theta - dyn ] ) , along with the vanishing of @xmath31 and @xmath88 at @xmath91 , can be given as    @xmath92    and @xmath93    using the algebraic equations of ( [ sigma - stat ] ) and ( [ theta - stat ] ) and the condition that @xmath94 , it can be shown that for a gravastar in equilibrium the surface tension , @xmath95 , is always negative .",
    "this then justifies that no exotic matter ( with negative pressure ) is required to form the shell of a gravastar in equilibrium .",
    "note that whenever an eos is given only one of the values of @xmath17 and @xmath53 can be chosen freely because , in virtue of ( [ sigma - stat ] ) and ( [ theta - stat ] ) , @xmath96 has to be consistent with the eos . on the other hand whenever no definite choice is made for an eos then the configuration space of gravastars in equilibrium",
    "may be parameterized by @xmath17 and @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath97 gets to be determined by relations ( [ sigma - stat ] ) and ( [ theta - stat ] ) .    in depicting the configuration space of gravastars in equilibrium",
    "it is useful to identify the region on the @xmath98 plain where the dec holds ( see figure [ figure2 ] ) . in doing so",
    "recall first that whenever @xmath51 is non - negative for a gravastar in equilibrium @xmath78 has to be negative .",
    "this immediately implies that the dec reduces to @xmath99 ; furthermore the upper boundary of the subregion of the @xmath98 plain where the dec is satisfied is signified by the @xmath100 curve .",
    "this curve  determined by the implicit relation @xmath101can be given as    @xmath102    which intersects the @xmath53-axis at the value @xmath103 ( see figure [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , whenever the dec holds @xmath53 has to be greater than or equal to @xmath104 .",
    "this value of the minimal radius immediately imposes a strict limitation on the compactness , expressed by the @xmath105 ratio , of a gravastar in equilibrium .",
    "it also follows from ( [ dec ] ) that for small @xmath17 the approximation @xmath106 holds .    for comparison it is useful to recall that the value of the ratio @xmath105 is also restricted in the case of conventional star models composed by matter satisfying the dec . in the case of spherically",
    "symmetric static configurations under various assumptions concerning the energy density and pressure of the star the ratio @xmath105 has been investigated .",
    "a comprehensive summary of the pertinent results can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is shown there that if pressure is non - negative ( although it may be anisotropic ) and the dec holds , then the numerical value of the sharp upper bound for @xmath105 is @xmath107 .",
    "it is interesting that the corresponding upper bound for a gravastar in equilibrium is a little bit smaller @xmath108 .",
    "one of the readings of this finding is that whenever the dec holds the radius of the most compressed gravastar in equilibrium is definitely larger than the radius of the most compressed conventional star .",
    "this indicates then that instead of asking whether these gravastars can be distinguished from bhs , by any sort of astrophysical observations , it is more appropriate to ask whether they can be distinguished from the most compact stars .      in deciding whether a gravastar is in equilibrium there has been no need to choose a specific eos .",
    "nevertheless , whenever we want to study the radial stability of these configurations we shall need to know the eos , at least , in a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath51 as merely the knowledge of @xmath78 and @xmath51 will not suffice then .    before turning to the radial stability of gravastars",
    "there are some conceptual issues to be mentioned . in spite of the familiarity of the dynamical equation",
    "@xmath109 it is better not applying automatically the analogous one - dimensional classical mechanical arguments .",
    "the main reason is related to the fact that @xmath83 is not an external potential . in the case of the classical mechanical problem the ` total energy '",
    "need not to be zero so we may simply either increase the kinetic energy term or change the potential energy by moving out of our system from its equilibrium . in both cases , since the potential is supposed to be intact , the total energy is changed . as opposed to this in the case of a gravastar",
    "if the initial velocity is changed the potential has also to be changed since the formal ` total energy ' needs to remain zero .",
    "the change in the initial velocity @xmath31 affects the initial surface energy density , @xmath51 , therefore the solution @xmath40 of ( [ general - eos ] ) , and , in turn , @xmath110 is also affected .",
    "this verifies that it is better to avoid thinking of @xmath110 as an external potential .    in carrying out the radial stability of gravastars we shall assume that @xmath33 smoothly depends on its indicated variables .",
    "this implies then that under a sufficiently small perturbation of a gravastar in equilibrium the sign of the second derivative , @xmath111 , will be intact . in particular , since the perturbation increases the kinetic term , the potential has to become negative in a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath53 whence the yielded motion of the gravastar will be bounded if the value of @xmath111 is guaranteed to be positive .",
    "accordingly , a gravastar in equilibrium , with radius @xmath53 , is considered to be stable if @xmath112 .",
    "as was already mentioned , the vanishing of @xmath113 and @xmath114in the classical mechanical analogy ",
    "corresponds to vanishing speed , @xmath115 , and , in turn , the forces are balanced .",
    "the equilibrium configurations can be classified according to the convex - concave character of the potential , i.e. it is reasonable to distinguish the following three categories .    *",
    "_ stable _ : a gravastar in equilibrium is considered to be stable whenever small perturbations of the system yield small local oscillations around the equilibrium state . in this case",
    "the potential has to be a convex function near @xmath53 .",
    "this may happen whenever @xmath116 .",
    "( see , e.g. , the transition from potential 1 to potential 2 in figure [ figure1 ] ) . * _ locally unstable _ : this occurs if the potential is concave ( at least from one side ) near @xmath53 .",
    "this means that small perturbations may yield non - local motions .",
    "this locally unstable situation may arise , e.g , whenever @xmath117 .",
    "( for an illustration see graph 3 in figure [ figure1 ] , where @xmath65 takes the role of @xmath53 ) .",
    "if @xmath118 is not continuous at @xmath53 but has well - defined left- and right - hand - sided limit values the equilibrium state will be called locally unstable if either of these limit values is negative .",
    "+ the vanishing of @xmath111 may also occur . in this case",
    "the sign of the least non - zero @xmath29-derivative of @xmath33 determines the character of the potential .",
    "for instance , the graph of @xmath33 may change its character from concave into convex or vice versa through an inflexion point whenever @xmath119 is the first non - zero higher order derivative .",
    "this means that the equilibrium is locally unstable in one direction",
    ". however if the first non - zero @xmath29-derivative of @xmath33 is @xmath120 , then the graph of @xmath33 may have local minimum or maximum in accordance with the sign of @xmath120 . *",
    "_ neutral _ : it may also happen that the potential is identically zero , @xmath121 , in the neighborhood of @xmath53 . in this particular case",
    "the equilibrium is called neutral ( throughout this neighborhood ) .",
    "5.5 mm     in determining the value of @xmath111 recall first that @xmath44 can be given as    @xmath122    the terms @xmath123 and @xmath124 can be expressed by using equations ( [ sigma - dyn ] ) and ( [ theta - dyn ] ) .",
    "for instance , in virtue of ( [ v ] ) , and since @xmath125 and @xmath126 , we find that @xmath124 can be given in terms of @xmath127 and @xmath128 exclusively .",
    "similarly , @xmath123 can be seen to depend on @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 exclusively , i.e. no higher order @xmath29-derivatives of @xmath127 are needed in evaluating @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , in the case of a gravastar in equilibrium , i.e. whenever @xmath130 and @xmath131 , @xmath111 can be expressed as a function of the variables @xmath17 , @xmath53 and @xmath132 .",
    "this means  as was mentioned before  in carrying out the stability analysis of gravastars in equilibrium only the derivative @xmath133 of the eos at @xmath51 comes into play .",
    "it can be shown that for stable configurations the square of the speed of sound is bounded from below by    @xmath134    where @xmath135 is nothing but the square of the speed of sound @xmath136 at @xmath53 for configurations with @xmath137 .",
    "this , in particular , means that @xmath138 whenever @xmath139 .    to see that ( [ omegamin0 ] ) holds note first that @xmath30 and @xmath58given originally as functions @xmath140 and",

    "next we have to make an assumption about the eos after the collision .",
    "since we have no observational clues , as it was indicated above , we shall assume that the eos remains intact , which means that the dust shell melts into the matter of the gravastar shell yielding an increase of the pressure according to its mass contribution .",
    "note that in the case of an initially homogeneous linear eos the possibility of keeping the surface tension to be intact will also be investigated .",
    "this latter case might be a good approximation whenever the contribution of the dust shell to the new shell s composition is negligible .      as was mentioned in subsection [ eossubsec ] , the simplest possible eos is the homogeneous linear one .",

    "in particular , @xmath219 may take all the values from the interval @xmath221 $ ] only for @xmath168 , i.e. whenever the inner region is vacuum .",
    "also note that @xmath222 has to be smaller than @xmath223 .",
    "if @xmath224 occurred , the system composed of the gravastar and the dust shell would get beyond its own schwarzschild radius before the collision occurred .",
    "this makes the use of the rescalled quantity @xmath225 to be advantageous .    before interpreting figures [ w0surf ] and [ v2p2 ]",
    "let us recall that a homogeneous linear eos , @xmath226 , has @xmath212 as the only parameter .",
    "therefore , it is also straightforward to investigate the case when both the surface tension and the functional form of the eos remain intact during the collision .",
    "it is done by determining the value of the new @xmath227 via the relation @xmath228 .",
    "if this happens the particles of the dust shell do not adopt the properties of the particles comprising the surface of the gravastar as only the rest mass of the surface will be increased by the collision . in figures",

    "it is also visible that dynamical gravastars can not get below the buchdahl limit so they definitely remains less compact than the most compact conventional stars satisfying the dec .",
    "second , on the right two panels with @xmath186 the grey regions on one side are bounded by the dashed lines representing the @xmath17 dependence of @xmath53 of the initial gravastar .",
    "this is , on one hand , in accordance with intuition as the particles of the dust shell are simply simultaneously placed on the surface of the gravastar .",
    "what might be unexpected , on the other hand , is the following .",
    "whenever the eos remains intact ( see the right - top panel of figure [ bananas ] ) there is a subregion where the dashed line bounds from above and another where it bounds from below . from zero",
    "to @xmath222 first the radius increases .",
    "however , for configurations with @xmath232 there is a turning point in @xmath29 and before reaching @xmath222 the radius is smaller than the initial @xmath53 . ]",
    "these subregions are separated by a point @xmath233 where the initial gravastar remains apparently at rest for @xmath234 , while whenever the surface tension remains intact  as it is indicated by the bottom - right panel of figure [ bananas] the dynamical range for @xmath234 is always bounded from above by the initial gravastar configurations .",
    "since the gravastar radius has always to decrease at the moment of the collision the surface density must increase at this moment .",
    "thus , the functional form of the new effective potential depends only on that of the eos relevant for mass density greater than @xmath51 .",
    "motivated by this observation we have used the following particular broken linear eos .",
    "@xmath194 was chosen to be the breaking point , i.e. the choice @xmath235 was made , and only the slope was varied for @xmath236 . since we have found that the higher the value of @xmath212 the more stable is a gravastar , in the broken linear eos we have chosen @xmath237 and @xmath63 to be varied form zero to 1 , in steps @xmath238 , as it is indicated on the right panel of figure [ w1dec ] .",
    "is chosen to be maximal such that the dec is still guaranteed to hold .",
    "on the graphs of the left panels the value of @xmath63 decreases form 1 to zero , in steps @xmath238 , while moving downward .",
    ", width=377 ]    in figure [ w1dec ] the @xmath17 dependence of @xmath222 , i.e the maximal value of the gravitational mass of the shell that may be dropped onto a stable gravastar without converting it into a bh is shown for configurations with @xmath185 and @xmath186 . on both of the left panels the value of @xmath63 decreases from 1 to zero while moving from the top to the bottom .",
    "it is also visible that for each particular value of @xmath63 there is a maximal value of @xmath17 that is indicated by the vertical ticks on the horizontal axis of the the top - left panel .",
    "these figures do also justify  for the pertinent linear approximation of the eos  that for given @xmath17 and @xmath53 the larger the value of @xmath239 the more stable the gravastar becomes in the sense that the allowed value of @xmath222 increases together with @xmath240 .",
    "a polytrop eos of the form of ( [ polytrop ] ) has two parameters , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "given a point @xmath241with @xmath242it is not obvious to choose at all the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 to get an eos fitting to this point except for the choice @xmath243 .",
    "to overcome this slight technical difficulty and also because for a given value of @xmath74 the choice @xmath243 always yields the most stable configuration , we have chosen @xmath243 and varied only the value of @xmath74 .",
    "it is also informative to compare the behavior of a gravastar with a polytrop eos and with a linear one having the same slope at @xmath51 as it is indicated by the nested panel in figure [ kappa2 ] relevant for the particular choice @xmath243 . for any choice of @xmath17 the value of @xmath53",
    "is chosen to be determined by the intersection of the @xmath167 line and the dashed - dotted curve in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "note that if @xmath53 was chosen to be the maximal value for a given @xmath17 such that the dec holds , the polytrop eos would degenerate into the homogeneous linear one with @xmath100 .",
    "and the linear one , having the same slope at @xmath51 are illustrated .",
    "left : for any choice of @xmath17 the corresponding value of @xmath53 is determined by the intersection of the @xmath167 line and the dashed - dotted curve in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "the @xmath17 dependence of @xmath225 is shown for two types of eos and for the two types of initial velocities , @xmath185 and @xmath186 . the order of the curves from top to bottom coincides with that of the legend at the upper right corner . , width=264 ]    the @xmath17 dependence of the maximum of the normalized gravitational mass of the dust shell , @xmath225 , where @xmath222 is the maximal mass that may be dropped onto a gravastar without converting it into a bh is shown in figure [ kappa2 ] for two types of eos and for the two types of choices concerning the initial velocities , @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "as it might have been anticipated , figure [ kappa2 ] justifies that a gravastar characterized by a polytrop eos is more stable than the corresponding one with the linear eos in consequence of the fact that the slope of the polytrop eos is larger than that of the linear one for @xmath236 .",
    "in this paper , besides providing a short survey of gravastars in equilibrium , the radial stability of gravastars was investigated .",
    "the latter was done by determining the response of a gravastar to the arrival of a dust shell onto its surface . concerning the matter model of the surface of the gravastar three different types of eos",
    "were applied .",

    "our most important findings are as follows . among the investigated eoss",
    "the homogeneous linear one with @xmath246 appears to provide the largest possible stability for gravastars in the sense that for a chosen @xmath17 the value of @xmath222 attains its largest possible value for @xmath246 .",
    "it would be interesting to find an analytical justification of this observation .",
    "it also follows from our investigations that once an eos is fixed , for a given value of @xmath53 , the smaller the value of @xmath17 , or alternatively , for a given value of @xmath17 , the larger the value of @xmath53 the more stable is a gravastar .",
    "the maximal mass of the shell that may be dropped onto a gravastar in equilibrium without converting it into a bh is also determined .",
    "the normalized value of this gravitational mass @xmath225 was found to be the largest @xmath247 whenever the matter comprising the surface of the gravastar possesses a homogeneous linear eos with @xmath100 and @xmath186 .",
    "correspondingly the value of @xmath248 is of the order 1 for a gravastar with radius @xmath249 which indicates that gravastars may be significantly more stable ( although not smaller ) than ordinary stars .    in the appendix",
    "a generic framework describing the totally inelastic collision of two shells is also shown .",
    "the reason behind considering inelastic collisions is that the de sitter region of a gravastar is unstable against hydrodynamical excitations .",
    "thereby , it is reasonable to assume that the particles of the dust shell merge to the particles of the surface of the gravastar . in most of the considered cases , for the sake of simplicity , we also assume that the eos of the surface of the gravastar remains intact during the collision .",
    "all these assumptions indicate that there might be various generalizations of the simple model we applied .",
    "nevertheless , our findings in all the investigated cases clearly manifest that even a dynamical gravastar can not be more compact than the smallest possible ordinary stars of the same mass provided that for both types of models the dec is guaranteed to hold .",
    "this means that the main issue is not that whether gravastars can be distinguished from a bh . assuming that they exist in reality it is more appropriate to ask whether they can be distinguished from compact regular stars .",
    "let us finally turn the case of a generic bh mimicking gravastar without restricting our considerations by referring to the dec or to any particular eos of the surface layer .",
    "note that in this case the size of the gravastar is not bounded from below so , in particular , the assumption @xmath250 corresponding to the requirement of mazur and mottola may also hold .",

    "is @xmath251 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the particles of the dust shell move toward the gravastar with velocity as if they started from rest at infinity , i.e. @xmath185 . then , the mass of the composed system is @xmath252 . in order to avoid the situation in which the composed system gets beyond its own schwarzschild radius @xmath253 , in advance to the collision , for the radius of the initial gravastar , @xmath254",
    ", the inequality @xmath255 must hold .",
    "this immediately implies then that @xmath256 , and in turn that the closer the radius of the initial gravastar is to the schwarzschild radius the smaller the mass of the dust shell , which may be dropped onto it without converting it into a bh , must be . in other words ,",
    "the better is a gravastar in mimicking a bh the easier is to destroy it by the described process .",
    "note that since this argument does not refer to the internal structure of the gravastar model it applies not only to the simplified three - layer model of visser and wiltshire or to the original model of mazur and mottola but essentially to any analogous construction .",

    "the components of the 4-velocity , with respect to the coordinates in regions bounding shell @xmath257 , can be given as    @xmath265    where @xmath266 denotes the proper time on the shell @xmath257 and the suffixes @xmath267 or @xmath268 indicate whether the pertinent region is outside or inside with respect to the shell @xmath257 .",
    "note that  as opposed to the area radius , @xmath269 , which is everywhere continuous  the time coordinate is not continuous across a shell .",
    "once the components of @xmath264 are fixed the spacelike outward pointing unit vector , @xmath270 , normal to the shell @xmath257 can be determined by the orthogonality condition , @xmath271 , and its components can be given as    @xmath272    the evaluation of ( [ uup ] ) and ( [ nup ] ) requires the determination of the radial velocity , @xmath273 .",
    "there are various ways to get the value of @xmath273 .",
    "the most widely known method is based on the thin - shell formalism of israel - sen - lanczos - darmois . for a comprehensive summary of this formalism see @xcite .",
    "after an appropriate reformulation of the ` master equation ' ( see equation ( 38 ) of @xcite ) , which is in fact an energy balance equation , @xmath273 , can be given as    @xmath274    where @xmath275 denotes the rest mass , while @xmath276 stands for the gravitational mass of the shell @xmath257 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath277 for @xmath278 and @xmath279 . note that the rest mass of the shell of a gravastar , in general , is a function of the area radius , nevertheless , the rest mass of a dust shell is constant .",
    "recall that the components of the 4-velocity can not be independent as @xmath280 which , in particular , implies that    @xmath281    the substitution of ( [ rdot ] ) into ( [ tdot ] ) , and some straightforward algebraic manipulations , yields that    @xmath282    where @xmath283 , referred as the self - gravity of the shell @xmath257 .",
    "returning to the main line of the argument recall that our aim is to determine the motion of the shell yielded by the merging of the two initial ones .",
    "in doing so the only guiding principle we can use is the conservation of 4-momentum    @xmath284    which has to be evaluated at the moment of the collision .",
    "note that the content of ( [ 4-momentum ] ) is nothing but two scalar equations .",
    "the temporal component corresponds to the energy conservation , while the radial component expresses to the radial momentum conservation .",
    "the other two components vanish identically due to the spherical symmetry .",
    "the two non - trivial equations completely determine the motion of the outgoing shell since , as we shall see below , both the radial velocity and the rest mass @xmath182 get to be fixed by them .",
    "note that since the collision is inelastic a part of the kinetic energy is converted into binding energy which , in particular , implies that @xmath285 .",
    "in applying ( [ 4-momentum ] ) each of the 4-velocities have to be expressed with respect to a common coordinate basis field .",
    "start by choosing the coordinate basis field of region 1 as our reference frame .",
    "then , in virtue of ( [ uup ] ) , the formal expressions of the components of @xmath286 and @xmath287 can immediately be determined .",
    "similarly , in virtue of ( [ uup ] ) and ( [ nup ] ) , the coordinate basis components of @xmath286 and @xmath288 of region 1 are known , therefore @xmath289 may be expressed there as the linear combination    @xmath290    by applying ( [ met1 ] ) , ( [ met2 ] ) , ( [ uup ] ) and ( [ nup ] )    @xmath291    which , along with the notation @xmath292 , implies that    @xmath293    by substituting these relations into ( [ u2a ] ) the components of @xmath289 in region 1 are determined . finally , by making use of these components , along with ( [ a7 ] ) , the two non - trivial equations in ( [ 4-momentum ] ) can be given as    @xmath294    where @xmath295 can be eliminated from ( [ w3 ] ) by using the relation @xmath296 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that in deriving these relations no use of the eos of the shells has been made .",
    "let us finally restrict our considerations to the case of a dust shell falling onto a gravastar . since the gravastar is in equilibrium @xmath297 .",
    "thus , in virtue of ( [ p3 ] ) , we get    @xmath298    whenever @xmath299 then @xmath200 also holds",
    ". whenever @xmath300 and the gravitational mass of the shell is equal to its proper mass  in this case @xmath185by making use of the notation of section 3 the relations @xmath301 , @xmath302 , @xmath303 , @xmath304 and ( [ v2 ] ) can also hold . by substituting them into ( [ forgravastar ] ) the radial velocity , @xmath305 , of the shell , at the moment of the collision ,",
    "can be written as    @xmath306",
