    "two - dimensional electron systems have been the platform for many interesting phenomena . in particular , the integer [ ] and fractional [ ] quantum hall effects occur when a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) is placed in a magnetic field .",
    "integer quantum hall ( iqh ) states occur when an integer number of landau levels are completely filled with electrons . for a partially filled landau level ( ll )",
    ", interactions between electrons can produce incompressible states at certain fillings and lead to fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states .",
    "these are characterized by the formation of composite fermions [ ] , where a composite fermion ( cf ) is the bound state of an electron and an even number of vortices .",
    "a strongly interacting state of electrons in a magnetic field @xmath1 is described by a weakly interacting state of composite fermions in an effective magnetic field @xmath2 , whose direction can be either parallel or antiparallel to @xmath1 .",
    "the composite fermions form landau - like levels ( called @xmath3 levels ) in the field @xmath2 , in analogy to the lls of non - interacting electrons .",
    "the fqh states of electrons are described as iqh states of composite fermions , which correspond to situations where composite fermions occupy an integer number of @xmath3 levels .",
    "this results in fqh effect at the prominently observed fractions @xmath4 where @xmath5 indicate that the direction of the effective magnetic field is parallel ( antiparallel ) to the real magnetic field .",
    "since fqh states occur in the presence of a large magnetic field , one might at first expect that the spin degree of freedom is frozen .",
    "however , in the most widely studied gaas system , the @xmath6-factor is very small , and unpolarized or partially polarized quantum hall states have been found to occur .",
    "the cf theory predicts the possible spin polarizations at various fractions in terms of composite fermions filling both up and down spin @xmath3 levels ( @xmath3ls ) [ ] .",
    "the spin polarization is determined by a competition between the cf cyclotron energy and the zeeman energy @xmath7 ; at very small zeeman energies the state with smallest spin polarization is obtained , and transitions into larger spin polarizations occur as the zeeman energy is increased .",
    "this physics has been found to be in good qualitative and semi - quantitative agreement with experiments [ ] .",
    "in particular , both the 2/5 and the 2/3 fqh states map into filling factor 2 of composite fermions ( with effective magnetic field antiparallel to the applied field for 2/3 ) ; the spin unpolarized state maps into the state in which 0@xmath8 and 0@xmath9 @xmath3ls are occupied , and the fully polarized state is described as the one in which 0@xmath8 and 1@xmath8 @xmath3ls are occupied .    our concern in this paper is with the physics of the edge excitations of the fqh states .",
    "the fqh states are gapped in the bulk but there are gapless excitations residing at the boundary [ ] , which provide a realization of a nontrivial one dimensional tomonaga - luttinger liquid [ ] .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been used to study the edge states , especially the chern - simons theory [ ] . in general , the fqh state at @xmath10 has @xmath11 edge modes , one corresponding to each @xmath3l . a surprising prediction of the edge theory has been the presence of backward moving neutral modes for the fqh states at @xmath12 for which the effective magnetic field for composite fermions is antiparallel to the real magnetic field [ ] . evidence of such counter - propagating edge modes has been seen in a recent experiment [ ] .",
    "we will consider the fqh state at 2/3 , which is the simplest state where backward moving modes are theoretically predicted .",
    "the bulk physics of both the spin unpolarized and spin polarized fqh states at 2/3 is closely related to that of the spin unpolarized and spin polarized iqh states at 2 , as has been demonstrated by wu , dev and jain [ ] . in this paper",
    ", we study the edge states of @xmath0 using a combination of the parton method , exact diagonalization , and the microscopic cf theory to test predictions of the effective field theory , and also to gain further insight into the physics of the backward moving edge modes .",
    "the presence of up - stream modes can be motivated in different ways .",
    "for fully spin polarized states , the presence of such modes appears naturally for the fqh states at @xmath13 which are particle hole symmetric to the principal states . consider the fully spin polarized 2/3 fqh state for example , which can be viewed as the 1/3 state of holes in the background of one filled landau level . in this picture",
    "the 2/3 state is surrounded by a @xmath14 state at the boundary , which in turn is surrounded by vacuum [ ] .",
    "the edge between 1 and vacuum supports a forward moving mode , whereas the edge between 2/3 and 1 supports a backward moving mode .",
    "the physics suggested by the cf theory has similarity to the picture described above . at filling factor 2",
    "we have two edges , one separating 2 and 1 , and the other between 1 and 0 ( _ i.e. _ vacuum ) . upon antiparallel flux attachment , filling factors 2 , 1 and 0 turn into 2/3 , 1 , and 0 , thus again producing a @xmath14 region separating the 2/3 state and the vacuum .",
    "one can therefore expect a counter - propagating mode by the reasoning given above .",
    "an analogous picture is not available for the spin singlet 2/3 state , however .",
    "this state can not be viewed as the hole partner of any principal state , because particle hole symmetry in the presence of spin relates @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "the picture for the edge of the spin unpolarized 2/3 state is qualitatively different .",
    "the edge of the spin unpolarized state at 2 goes directly from 2 to 0 , implying a 2/3 - 0 edge for the spin unpolarized 2/3 state .",
    "because of the absence of @xmath14 at the boundary , it is not obvious why there should be an up - stream edge mode .",
    "nonetheless , an effective @xmath17 matrix description of wen [ ] indicates a backward moving edge mode for both spin unpolarized and spin polarized states .",
    "the @xmath17 matrix can be obtained in the cf basis straightforwardly by noting that the 2@xmath182 @xmath17 matrix for filling factor 2 is @xmath19 for antiparallel field .",
    "composite fermionization of electrons by attachment of two vortices amounts to adding 2 to each each element of @xmath17 , giving @xmath20 for both the spin unpolarized and spin polarized 2/3 states .",
    "this matrix has one positive and one negative eigenvalue , implying one down - stream and one up - stream edge mode . as explained in ref .",
    "[ ] , this structure of @xmath21 possesses a hidden @xmath22 symmetry , with an @xmath22 algebra generated by the neutral modes .",
    "for contrast , the @xmath17 matrix of the 2/5 state in the cf basis is given by @xmath23 obtained by adding 2 to each element of @xmath24 ; both eigenvalues of this matrix are positive , hence no backward moving modes ( neglecting edge reconstruction ) .",
    "yet another way to intuitively understand why there should be backward moving modes in the @xmath25 fqh state is to note that composite fermions experience a negative effective field .",
    "because switching the direction of the magnetic field reverses the direction of the @xmath26 drift , we can expect composite fermions at the edge moving in the backward direction .",
    "more explicitly , consider the wave function in eq .",
    "( [ reverseflux ] ) below , written in the symmetric gauge .",
    "the edge modes at @xmath25 derive from the edge modes of @xmath27 .",
    "the state @xmath27 has @xmath11 independent edge modes , and the energy of a single excitation at each edge increases with its angular momentum ( relative to the ground state ) .",
    "however , because of the complex conjugation of @xmath27 , an increase in the angular momentum in @xmath27 translates into a _ decrease _ in the angular momentum at @xmath25 , thus producing a mode moving in the opposite direction .",
    "while this seems to give a rather nice picture for the origin of backward moving modes , it suggests that there are as many backward moving modes at @xmath25 as there are forward moving modes at @xmath11 , which is inconsistent with the effective @xmath17 matrix description that produces a single backward moving edge mode .",
    "our aim in this work is to gain a microscopic understanding of the edge excitations of the negative flux cf states by considering the example of 2/3 , and to bring consistency between the different approaches .",
    "we show , by an explicit construction of the wave functions , that only the neutral combination of the upstream edge modes survives at low energies , which is also in good agreement with exact diagonalization studies .",
    "in addition , we identify the forward moving modes with the so called  schur \" modes , which are obtained by multiplying the ground state wave function by the symmetric schur polynomials ; these are analogous to the edge modes at filling factor one . we study both polarized and unpolarized states at 2/3 , and , for comparison , also show results of the @xmath28 state , which is also described as @xmath29 filled @xmath3ls but with parallel flux attachment .",
    "the edge states of @xmath0 have also been studied by exact diagonalization .",

    "moore and haldane [ ] have studied the spin singlet 2/3 state by exact diagonalization to demonstrate the presence of a backward moving mode .",
    "the validity of the cf theory for electron droplets in the disk geometry , which can contain complex edges , has been studied extensively in a number of previous articles [ ] .",
    "we note that the edge of the spin singlet 2/3 state provides a striking realization of spin charge separation , with pure spin and pure charge modes moving in opposite directions .",

    "this complicates the counting of the edge modes for finite size systems , and is also the likely cause of the mismatch between the exact spectra and the expectation from the effective theory .",
    "we have studied the edge states of spin unpolarized and polarized @xmath0 states within the framework of the cf theory , both using parton construction and the microscopic cf wave functions .",
    "the parton construction of composite fermions produces one forward moving charge mode and one backward moving neutral mode for both spin unpolarized and polarized @xmath74 states , which agrees with the predictions of chern - simons effective field theory .",
    "backward moving modes also appear naturally from the observation that at 2/3 composite fermions experience negative magnetic field , and thus move at the edge in a direction opposite to that of electrons .",
    "a naive counting would suggest _ two _ backward moving edge modes , one from each @xmath3 level , but we have shown , by explicit construction of the cf wave functions , that one mode is projected out of the low energy sector and the remaining excitations are good approximations of the exact states for both spin unpolarized and spin polarized 2/3 state .",
    "the forward moving modes are schur modes ; they are harder to identify in the exact spectra of small systems because , due to the larger velocity of these modes , they quickly enter into the continuum of bulk excitations across @xmath3 levels .",
