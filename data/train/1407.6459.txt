    "amoebas of complex varieties with their cousin coamoebas play a major role as a link between complex algebraic geometry and tropical geometry .",
    "moreover , they are used in several areas of mathematics , in real algebraic geometry , mirror symmetry , algebraic statistics , complex analysis ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "we show in this paper that the logarithmic limit sets and the phase limit sets play a role as crucial as the role played by their relatives . indeed , their role is a link between complex algebraic geometry and phase tropical geometry .",
    "more precisely , this is a quadruplet ( logarithmic limit set , amoeba , coamoeba , phase limit set ) and we can not dissociate one of these objects from the others .",
    "we do believe that these objects are not yet fully exploited , and they contain more information about our original object which is the complex variety .",
    "this information can be apparently of different nature e.g. , geometric , algebraic , topological , combinatorial .",
    "but they are often equivalent .",
    "we prove in this paper the equivalence between some properties of algebraic nature on one hand and some properties of combinatorial and topological nature , on the other hand .",
    "another equivalence between geometric nature properties and of algebraic nature was proven in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we show that @xmath0-dimensional irreducible analytic subvarieties of the complex torus are algebraic , if their logarithmic limit sets are finite rational @xmath1-dimensional complex polyhedrons . in addition , if the dimension of the ambient space is at least the double of the dimension of the varieties , then , these properties are equivalent to the fact that the volume of the amoebas of the varieties are finite , which is a completely geometric property .",
