    "following the first experimental demonstration of graphene@xcite , two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials have attracted increasing attention both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "especially transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds)@xcite with chemical formula mx@xmath2 ( where m is a transition metal atom and x is a chalcogen atom ) have been a favored subject .",
    "there are also other stoichiometric forms of transition metal dichalcogenides such as titanium trisulfide ( tis@xmath3 ) that can form monolayer crystals.@xcite tmds have a special 2d layered structure .",
    "their mono- and few - layered forms offer many opportunities for fundamental and technological research@xcite because of their exceptional electronic , mechanical and optical properties@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that various kinds of tmds such as mos@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 , mose@xmath0 , wse@xmath0 , res@xmath0 , nbs@xmath2 , tis@xmath2 , and tise@xmath2 have been synthesized@xcite and studies have revealed that tmds exhibit metallic , semimetallic , semiconducting , and even superconducting behavior with different phases such as @xmath4h , @xmath4 t and their distorted forms .    the presence of exotic properties in @xmath5d materials , that stemmed from increasing quantum confinement effects , has also motivated researchers to further reduce their dimension and to investigate one - dimensional ( @xmath4d ) nanoribbons . in early studies",
    "it was shown that armchair and zigzag graphene nanoribbons ( nrs ) were semiconductors with an energy gap decreasing with increasing ribbon width.@xcite in addition , zigzag graphene nanoribbons ( zgnrs ) have ferromagnetically ordered edge states and can display half - metallic behavior when an external electric field is applied.@xcite furthermore , motivated by the potential use of single layer mos@xmath2 in nanoscale optoelectronic devices , its nanoribbons have been studied intensively.@xcite armchair mos@xmath2 nrs are direct band gap semiconductors with a nonmagnetic ground state . unlike gnrs their band gaps do not vary significantly with the ribbon width.@xcite however , zigzag mos@xmath2 nrs are ferromagnetic metals regardless of their width and thickness.@xcite    despite the comprehensive research on graphene and single layer tmds , studies on the electronic properties of the group ivb tmds in the t phase , namely the two - dimensional @xmath4t - mx@xmath2 structures , are sparse .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath4t - tise@xmath2@xcite is an extensively studied quasi-@xmath5d tmd , which has a charge density wave ( cdw ) state and in condensed matter physics transitions from superconductivity to charge density wave phases has been shown to be very important@xcite .",
    "however , whether @xmath4t - tise@xmath2 is a semimetal or a semiconductor is still an open question@xcite .",
    "since tite@xmath2 is a semimetal with overlapping valence and conduction bands@xcite and tis@xmath2 is a semiconductor with an indirect gap@xcite , it can be expected that the band gap of tise@xmath2 is smaller or even nonexistent .",
    "note that in the periodic table selenium is in between sulfur and tellurium , and also selenium is less electronegative than sulfur .",
    "therefore , both experimental and theoretical techniques have been used to identify the semiconducting or semimetallic nature of 1t - tise@xmath2@xcite .",
    "very recently , peng et al.@xcite grew tise@xmath2 ultrathin films on a graphitized sic(0001 ) substrate by using molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) .",
    "their findings offer important insights into the nature of the charge density wave in tise@xmath2 , and paved the way for potential applications based on its collective electronic states@xcite .",
    "the successful mbe growth of tise@xmath2 ultrathin films down to monolayer thickness motivated us to investigate one - dimensional tise@xmath2 nanoribbons because of its interesting electronic and physical properties that are essentially related with its low dimensionality and effects due to quantum confinement .",

    "the optimized structures and electronic properties of @xmath4t - tise@xmath2 nanoribbons with desired edges ( zigzag or armchair ) reported here are based on first - principle calculations within the density functional theory ( dft ) using the plane - wave projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method@xcite implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp).@xcite the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite form of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) were adopted to describe the electron exchange and correlation for both spin - polarized and spin - unpolarized cases .    in order to correct the pbe band structure for a monolayer of tise@xmath2",
    ", we also used the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof 06 ( hse06 ) functional@xcite which is known to give better electronic structure description that is close to experiments and produce accurate band gaps .",

    ", we ensured a sufficient large supercell which is @xmath1 long perpendicular to the nanoribbon plane and with an edge - to - edge distance of at least @xmath12  . at the same time , all the atoms in the supercell were fully relaxed during the geometry optimization .",
    "the convergence threshold for energy was chosen as 10@xmath13 ev and 10@xmath14 ev /  for the force .",
    "the charge distribution on the atoms were calculated by using the bader analysis.@xcite    moreover , we investigated hydrogen saturated nanoribbons in order to study the edge stability .",
    "the hydrogen saturation was realized by adding one hydrogen atom to the edge of ti and se atoms for the zigzag nanoribbons , however for the armchair nanoribbons one hydrogen atom was added to the edge of se atoms and two hydrogen atoms are added to the ti atom . for the determination of the most favorable structure which means the structure after hydrogenation , the binding energies were estimated from : e@xmath15=e@xmath16[nr]+ne@xmath16[h]-e@xmath16[nr+nh ] where e@xmath16[nr ] is the total energy of the tise@xmath2 nanoribbon , e@xmath16[h ] is the energy of the free hydrogen atom , e@xmath16[nr+nh ] is the total energy of the tise@xmath2 nanoribbon saturated by hydrogen atoms , and n is the total number of saturated hydrogen atoms .",
    "before a comprehensive investigation of tise@xmath2 nanoribbons , we first present the atomic , electronic and magnetic properties of the tise@xmath2 monolayer . principally",
    ", layered structures of tmds can form several different phases , @xmath17 h and t , that result in diverse electronic properties .",

    "[ bandmonotise2](b ) , shows that single layer tise@xmath2 is a metal with a nonmagnetic ground state .",
    "in addition , the partial density of states ( pdos ) reveals that while there is negligible contribution from the se orbitals around the fermi level ( e@xmath25 ) , those bands are mainly composed of ti-@xmath26d orbitals ( d@xmath27 , d@xmath28 , d@xmath29 ) . at the same time",
    ", a bader analysis indicates that each ti atom gives 1.4 electrons to the se atoms which means that 0.7 electrons are taken by one se atom , hence this situation shows that the character of the bonding is ionic .",
    "in contrast , the band structure of 1 t tis@xmath2 is semiconducting .",
    "usually the difference in chalcogen atoms affects the structural properties , but has little influence on the electronic properties .",
    "for instance single layers of mose@xmath2 and mos@xmath2 are both direct band gap semiconductors .",
    "however , a tise@xmath2 sheet exhibits a metallic behavior with a low band crossing of the fermi level , which is different from tis@xmath2 .    to further examine the electronic properties of 1t - tise@xmath2",
    ", we also calculated the band structure with the hse06 method which is shown in fig . [ bandmonotise2](b ) .",
    "as can be seen the calculated bands below the fermi level are shifted upward while above the fermi level they are slightly shifted downward . at the same time , below the fermi level the bands are decomposed but the bands above the fermi level almost overlap with those of the pbe result . in general ,",
    "relative to the experimental values , band gaps of semiconducting materials are underestimated by pbe .",
    "however , pbe+hse06 provides better aggrement with the experimental values .",
    "applying hse06 corrections to metallic systems is not very common due to its computational cost , and no expected qualitative change in the band structures .",
    "its effect is to introduce some shifts to the bands but the metallic character is preserved .",
    "for instance , single - layered vs@xmath2 and t - mos@xmath2 are still found metallic with hse06 correction.@xcite consequently , from both the pbe and hse06 methods we may conclude that tise@xmath2 is metallic .",
    "the tise@xmath2 nanoribbons ( tise@xmath2-nrs ) are obtained by cutting the @xmath5d - tise@xmath2 monolayer . according to the different directions of termination",

    "the edge selenium atoms shift their position from the se layers to the ti layer for both zigzag and armchair nanoribbons whereas the ti atoms at the edges shift their position from the ti layer to the se layers for only zigzag nanoribbons . at one of the edges the ti atom is closer to the lower se layer , and the ti atom at the other edge is closer to the upper se layer . as seen in fig .",
    "[ zigzagarm](b ) for armchair nanoribbons reconstruction takes place , as the ti atoms at the edges moved towards the ribbon s center and the se atoms tend to shift slightly outward . for tise@xmath2 - 8znr , shown in fig . [",
    "zigzagarm](a ) , the ti atoms moved slightly out of the plane , leading to a change of the ti - se bond length along the ribbon - axis .",
    "nevertheless , the triple - layer networks are well kept intact for both ribbons .",
    "for instance , the average ti - se bond lengths for tise@xmath2 - 7znr are @xmath19 in the inner site , and @xmath32 at the two edges .",

    "all of the nanoribbons display the same structural property , and the only difference is that the bond lengths between the edge ti - se atoms are longer in znrs than those in anrs .",
    "similar to the case of mos@xmath2 nanoribbons@xcite , at the edges the ti - se bond lengths decrease because of the irregular force on the edge atoms .",
    "also , a bader charge analysis tells us that charges on both ti and se atoms are equally distributed along the ribbon axis , since all of the ti atoms lose the same amount of electron charge which is taken by the se atoms . likewise in the 2d - tise@xmath2 layer ,",
