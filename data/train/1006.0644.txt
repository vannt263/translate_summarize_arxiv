    "moreover , observe that the distortion of @xmath126 achieved by the hybrid scheme is not monotonic in @xmath121 when @xmath120 is fixed ( each red line ) , where the two extreme values of @xmath121 give the uncoded scheme and the hybrid scheme without analog @xmath59 , respectively .    .",

    "we have shown an optimal scheme in the gaussian setting is the proposed hybrid scheme , and thus we can limit ourselves to the distortion pairs achievable by this scheme .",
    "in fact we shall continue to use this scheme and the associated parameters when the sources and channel noises are not gaussian .",
    "more precisely , we shall now use @xmath136 instead of @xmath93 to construct the digital source codewords @xmath137 where @xmath84 is still a gaussian random variable with variance of @xmath138 , independent of everything else .",
    "the overall covariance structure of the scheme remains intact as in the gaussian case , and thus the same ( mse ) distortion pairs can be achieved , as long as the digital codewords can be correctly decoded at both the decoders , i.e. , @xmath139 with our choices of the parameters , where @xmath140 is the channel output in this non - gaussian setting .",
    "note that unlike in the gaussian case , here the broadcast channel is not necessarily degraded , and thus we also need to make sure that the codeword can be correctly decoded at the first decoder .",
    "to show the second decoder can succeed ( with high probability ) , we only need to observe that @xmath141 where in the second inequality we substitute @xmath93 of the gaussian version of the problem , because the terms have the same covariance structure , and gaussian distribution maximizes the differential entropy ; in the last but one equality , we add and subtract the same term @xmath142 , and the last equality is due to our specific choice of the parameters in the gaussian problem .    similarly , we can write @xmath143 where the second inequality is guaranteed by the relation in the gaussian case , which is indeed a degraded broadcast channel .",
