    "<S> concepts like randomness , ensemble - averaging or time - averaging are not required . instead , thermalization results from entanglement between system and environment . connections between matter and quantum information theory </S>",
    "<S> have also been discussed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such studies have pointed out that entanglement seems to be important in other areas of physics besides pure quantum information . </S>",
    "<S> it is exactly in this scope that this work is introduced .    </S>",
    "<S> considering entanglement as a legitimate physical quantity , this paper is intended to study a fundamental process namely the atomic spontaneous emission . </S>",
    "<S> it lies at the core of matter - radiation interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the successful description of atomic decay in free space is one of the remarkable achievements of the quantum theory of radiation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> why does an excited atom decay ? </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that an isolated atom would never decay from one excited state to another with lower energy because both are eigenstates of the system hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> there must be some physical system to couple to the atom in order drive the electronic transition . </S>",
    "<S> this external agent is the free space electromagnetic field whose zero - point energy fluctuations are able to cause the atom to decay . in the language of quantum information theory , the entanglement between atom and field is then the responsible for the atomic decay . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows , entanglement is studied in the spontaneous emission phenomenon .    </S>",
    "<S> we are particularly interested in the entanglement properties of quantum fields . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the quantized field is the bosonic free - space continuous electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we will analyze the entanglement properties of this field after atomic decay . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement in discretized bosonic fields have already been studied . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the entanglement properties of the ground state and thermal states of this system is studied in detail in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> discrete versions of real free klein - gordon fields have also been studied from the point of view of entanglement @xcite . in this study , </S>",
    "<S> the relation between entanglement , entropy , and area for a specific harmonic lattice whose continuum limit lead to the hamiltonian of the real klein - gordon field is analyzed in great detail . </S>",
    "<S> these papers triggered many others studies that also investigated entanglement in discretized quantum fields @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the starting point of the present work is the weisskopf - wigner theory of spontaneous emission which is now briefly presented @xcite . in the rotating wave approximation , </S>",
    "<S> a two - level atom interacts with the free - space electromagnetic field according to the interaction picture hamiltonian @xcite @xmath0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the angular frequency of the atomic transition ( excited state @xmath2 and ground state @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 is the position of the atom , @xmath5 is the annihilation operator for the field mode @xmath6 ( angular frequency @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8 where @xmath9 with @xmath10 a quantization volume , @xmath11 the electric permittivity of free space , @xmath12 the dipole moment for the atomic transition , and @xmath13 the polarization vector of the mode @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> it will be assumed that initially the atom is in the excited state @xmath2 and the field modes are in the vacuum @xmath14 . according to ( [ h ] ) </S>",
    "<S> the system evolved state will be @xmath15 represents the field state with one photon in the mode @xmath6 and the rest in the vacuum , and @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the free - space atomic decay constant which is giving by @xmath18 in order to obtain the above equations , it was considered that the intensity of the light associated with the emitted radiation is very centered about the atomic frequency @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the essence of the weisskopf - wigner theory . </S>",
    "<S> in this theory , the free space modes act as an immediate response reservoir , i.e. , the atomic spontaneous emission is seen as a markovian process .    </S>",
    "<S> now , the entanglement content in the field state after spontaneous decay of the atom is studied in detail . this state is denoted @xmath19 and it is obtained from ( [ psit ] ) by assuming @xmath20 latexmath:[\\ ] ] where , in our case , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are partitions of the field modes . in the special instance of a overall pure field state </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85 $ ] , the above inequality becomes an equality and entanglement is quantified by the entropy of the reduced state , as we did in this work . in order for our results to be valid ( at least qualitatively ) </S>",
    "<S> , we must make sure that the entropy of the field modes @xmath86 is in fact approximately zero . from the araki - lieb inequality @xcite @xmath87 , and the fact that the atom - field state ( [ psit ] ) remains pure all the time </S>",
    "<S> , we see that @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.([fig3 ] ) clearly shows that entropy of the atom ( consequently the entropy of the modes @xmath89 ) goes to zero quite rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath90 is achieved for @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> as one can see , our results remain essentially valid even for finite times , and this fact may facilitates the experimental investigation of the entanglement properties discussed here .    to summarize , we have studied bipartite entanglement in the atomic spontaneous emission phenomenon . for the field state after atomic decay </S>",
    "<S> , we have found that very detuned modes weakly entangle with the rest , and that the size of the frequency band of each partition strongly changes the entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> we have carefully analyzed the behavior of entanglement when such parameters change , and also physically justified all features . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to remark that the present work represents a study about fundamentals of matter - field interactions from the point of view of quantum information , and it does not necessarily aim at applications . </S>",
    "<S> actually , applications of the entanglement in the free space radiation field state after simple atomic decay as considered here seems unlikely . </S>",
    "<S> of course , atomic decay in free space could be used to entangle distant atoms as shown in @xcite . however , what we have just studied here is entanglement in the free space modes . </S>",
    "<S> this makes coherent control a challenging task when compared to atomic entanglement .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> we believe that a scheme to experimentally access the field entanglement induced by atomic decay could make use of photonic crystals . spontaneous emission in this environment has been studied in @xcite , and since this system is much more controllable than the electromagnetic fields in free space , we feel that this could be an alternative to study photonic entanglement due to atomic decay . </S>",
    "<S> it is hoped that the present work may be a starting point for addressing this question ( theoretical treatment of entanglement properties of atomic decay in photonic crystals ) as well as other interesting related questions such as the application of the techniques used in @xcite to study atomic decay . </S>"
