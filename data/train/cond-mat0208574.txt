    "recently , there have been considerable efforts to analyze financial data by means of methods developed for statistical physics . motivated by the scientific challenge to understand the nature of complex systems ,",
    "physicists have started to direct their attentions to a huge , and also growing amount of economics data recorded minutes by minutes for decades . among these interesting data ,",
    "the fluctuation of stock exchange indices is of special interest , since it might indirectly reflect the economic situation in a certain region and some people happily speculate their money on it .",
    "furthermore , the advancement in computing capabilities has enabled them to handle a large amount of data , unlike almost 40 years ago when mandelbrot investigated approximately 2000 data points of cotton prices @xcite .",
    "it is then expected that such studies could explain the nature of interacting elements in the complex system and , therefore , could help to forecast economic fluctuations in the future . in other words ,",
    "these studies were intended to produce new results in economics , which might help us to avoid economic `` earthquakes '' such as what happened in indonesia a few years ago @xcite .",
    "previous studies in this subject so far have focused only on the long - term behavior of the leading stock indices .",
    "this is understandable , since to statistically investigate the _",
    "universal features _ in economic activities one has to have a large amount of data . very little attentions are given to investigate what happen to the stock markets in developing countries ( e.g. , indonesia ) as well as what happen to the stock indices before , during , and after a financial ( or monetary ) crash , although in the latter the most important ingredients of the financial market or economic fluctuation could exist @xcite .",
    "it is the objective of this paper to study the general statistical properties of the fluctuation in stock indices in two developing countries , as well as their properties before and after a financial crashes .",
    "this study is important in order to investigate the extent of the _ universality _ of complex behavior found previously in the leading stock indices , such as s&p 500 and nyse .",
    "such investigation will naturally shed important information on the variation of the _ universal constants _ in the scaling behavior of the stock index . with this information at hand",
    "it is then possible to identify the statistical properties that quantify different behaviors in stock markets and those which indicate a crash or stable condition . for this purpose",
    "we take two different indices , the jakarta stock exchange index ( abbreviated with ihsg , an acronym of _ indeks harga saham gabungan _ or composite stock exchange price index ) and the kuala lumpur stock exchange index ( klse ) , which belong to different countries . comparing the two indices would be very interesting since both indonesia and malaysia underwent the same monetary crisis in 1997 , which are then followed by financial crashes in almost all economic sectors , but with quite different economic situations .",
    "as has been often discussed , the behavior of two stock indices could be very different although the two stock markets are situated in the same region .    before proceeding to the analysis",
    ", it is worth to glance at the indonesian and malaysian gross domestic products ( gdp ) shown in fig.[fig : gdp ] . before the crisis the growth rate of the indonesian gdp seems to be faster than that of malaysian gdp .",
    "the monetary crisis in 1997 has a clear impact on both gdps .",
    "nevertheless , the impact on indonesian gdp is more obvious .",
    "after the crisis , malaysia was rather successful to stabilize its economic situation and did not accept the international monetary fund ( imf ) prescription .",
    "three years after that malaysia was able to put its gdp slightly above the previous value in 1997 .",
    "on the other hand , indonesia was unable to stop the declination of rupiah against us dollar and decided to ask the imf to help stabilizing its monetary condition .",
    "other crises , which followed the monetary crisis , are blamed as the reasons of this .",
    "in our analysis we investigate the daily index returns , which are defined as @xmath0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath1 indicates the closing index of the stock at day @xmath2 .",
    "some previous studies @xcite are performed with the return defined as the difference in the index , instead of the difference in the logarithm of index as given by eq.([eq : return ] ) .",
    "however , in our analysis we found that the results of calculations by using both methods do not differ significantly .",
    "the available data for the ihsg index are the daily closing index data recorded from january 1988 to april 2002 which consist of 3526 data points .",
    "the klse data contain also the daily closing index starting from december 1993 and ending with june 2002 , which comprise totally 2104 data points .",
    "the number of data in both indices seems to be the first obstacle in this analysis , since compared with the previous analysis on the s&p 500 index , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , which used approximately @xmath3 data points , the number turns out to be extremely small .",
    "however , as shown by mandelbrot in his analysis on the cotton prices , even with about 2000 data points it is still possible to extract a quantitative conclusion from the data .",
    "figure [ fig : ihsg_return ] shows the time series of the ihsg index along with the logarithmic returns calculated by using eq.([eq : return ] ) .",
    "it is naturally difficult to define when exactly the crisis ( or crash ) started and when it finished . to get around this difficulty , in fig.[fig : ihsg_return ] we also display the historical time series of the exchange rate between 1000 indonesian rupiah and 1 us dollar , since the economic crash started with the decline of this rate .",
    "the available data do not fill the entire range , nevertheless they are sufficient to locate the period of the crisis .",
    "it should be noted that before the monetary crisis the government intervention on this exchange rate was very strong and as a consequence , although the rupiah was not pegged to us dollar with a fixed rate , the fluctuation in the exchange rate was relatively tiny .    in fig.[fig",
    ": ihsg_return ] we indicate the period when rupiah started to continuously drop ( 10th july 1997 ) until it reached the minimum point ( 23rd january 1998 ) .",
    "the ihsg index also dropped significantly during this period .",
    "however , the index continued to strongly fluctuate and reached another minimum about one year later due to the unfortunate political situation .",
    "the same phenomenon also happened in the foreign exchange rate , though with a different scale . in view of this , according to the ihsg index , the duration of financial crisis could be longer than one year .",
    "figure [ fig : klse_return ] displays the historical time series of the klse index along with their logarithmic returns and the ratio between 1 malaysian ringgit and 1 us dollar . coincidentally , our definition of the crash period fits nicely with the latter . as in the case of ihsg ,",
    "the klse index also significantly dropped during this period .",
    "the difference between indonesian and malaysian foreign exchange rate is , nevertheless , apparent here , since on 1st september 1998 malaysia imposed currency controls , the ringgit was pegged with us dollar with a fixed rate of 3.80 ringgit per dollar , while indonesia was unable to do that due to the multi - crisis that simultaneously occurred in this country . from fig.[fig : klse_return ] it is not clear whether or not such policy helped to elevate the klse index , since comparing with the ihsg fluctuation in fig.[fig : ihsg_return ] the two indices seem to be strongly correlated , thus other external factors could be more relevant to explain the improvement in the klse index .",
    "in fact , ref.@xcite claims that the policy has led to a misposition of the ringgit relative to its realistic exchange rate . during 1999",
    "the ringgit was overvalued since the regional currencies such as japan yen and singapore dollar have all depreciated against us dollar . as a consequence ,",
    "malaysian export became less competitive and eventually this policy led to an economic slowdown in malaysia .",
    "a quick glance to the index fluctuation @xmath1 in both figures reveals that the fluctuation is more dramatic than that of s&p 500 , indicating that in this case the situation is more complex .",
    "after the crash the magnitude of returns @xmath4 is obviously larger in both indices , or , in the economics language , the probability to gain or to loose becomes larger than before .",
    "in the next section , it will be shown that both indices are clearly more volatile after the crash .",
    "following previous studies @xcite we investigate the probability density function ( pdf or @xmath5 ) of the return to the origin @xmath6 in order to investigate the scaling behavior of the ihsg and klse index returns .",
    "the advantage of such analysis is obvious , since the number of data included is relatively small , while the probability is largest at @xmath7 , thus reducing the statistical inaccuracies .",
    "starting with the characteristic function @xcite @xmath8 the lvy stable distribution is given by @xmath9 from eq.([eq : levy ] ) the probability of return to the origin @xmath6 reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 indicates the gamma function .",
    "the log - log plots of @xmath6 as a function of the sampling time @xmath12 for both ihsg and klse indices are shown in the left panels of fig.[fig : distxyf0 ] .",
    "since the number of data points is relatively small we limit our analysis only up to @xmath13 days for the ihsg index and @xmath14 days for klse . in the former ( latter ) case",
    "the number of data points in each set decreases from 3526 ( 2104 ) for @xmath15 day to the value of 181 for @xmath13 days ( 160 for @xmath14 days ) .",
    "these values are already much smaller compared with previous analyses , e.g. , for the hang seng index @xcite one ends up with the value of 1481 for @xmath16 minutes .",
    "the slopes of linear regressions to these plots equal the negative inverse of the lvy stable distribution indices @xmath17 . using this index",
    "we calculate the parameter @xmath18 by means of eq.([eq : pz0 ] ) and plot the `` theoretical '' pdf as a function of normalized returns @xmath19 , using eq.([eq : levy ] ) , where @xmath20 the standard deviation of the distribution , and compare it with the empirical pdf obtained from data in the right panels of fig.[fig : distxyf0 ] .",
    "all relevant parameters obtained in this calculation are displayed in table [ tab : properties ] .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in section [ general ] we have shown that between july 1997 and september 1998 the index returns of both stocks fluctuate strongly .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig : volat ] , compared with the situations before and after this period , both indices become more volatile .",
    "a more quantitative description can be obtained from table[tab : properties_bda ] , where in the first line we average the index volatility over all times before 10th july 1997 , 16 month after that ( during which the volatility of both indices is significantly large ) , and over the rest of data , respectively .",
    "the result confirms the finding of ref.@xcite , namely the volatility of a stock index tends to be large right after the crash and in a relatively long period after that .",
    "this also happens to both stock indices , i.e. almost five years after the financial crisis both stocks are still more volatile than before .    in the financial literature",
    "the volatility is often calculated from the standard deviation of the returns distribution @xcite . in table[tab : properties_bda ] we also present the standard deviations of the ihsg and klse index returns distributions in all three cases .",
    "table[tab : properties_bda ] indicates that both definitions are consistent in our analysis .    from the kurtosis of stock indices we can see that the ihsg stock is more capitalized after the crash , whereas the klse stock displays a very different behavior .",
    "nevertheless , the skewness of their distributions shows a similar tendency , both stocks deliver less profits after the crash , although more profits could be obtained from the klse stock during the crash .",
    "it is clearly tempting to investigate whether or not the universal properties found in section [ general ] still exist in all periods and to ask what kind of differences might quantify these conditions .",
    "the answer can be found in figs.[fig : distxyf0_bda ] and [ fig : distxyf0_bda_klse ] .",
    "obviously in all cases the statistical accuracies are not as good as in the previous section , when we used all data in our analyses",
    ". nevertheless , in spite of the very limited data points used in our analysis , the message from figs.[fig : distxyf0_bda ] and [ fig : distxyf0_bda_klse ] is clear , the universal properties of the returns distribution retain their existences in all cases .",
    "linear regression to the ihsg probability of the return to the origin reveals the fact that the distribution turns from lvy to gaussian after the crash .",
    "surprisingly , the klse stock index shows a contrary result , the distribution alters from a gaussian to a lvy one after the crash .    a cross - check to the result shown in figs.[fig : distxyf0_bda ] and [ fig : distxyf0_bda_klse ] is inevitable , since the number of data could significantly limit statistical accuracies in this case . for this purpose in figs.[fig : momenti ] and [ fig : momentk ] we display the moments of both stock indices in the case of before , during , and after the financial crash .",
    "a consistent result is obtained from these figures , in the case of ihsg the distribution becomes closer to gaussian during and after crash , whereas the klse moments move away from the gaussian distribution after the crash .",
    "another important finding obtained from fig.[fig : momenti ] is that the scaling behavior up to @xmath21 shown by the ihsg case in the previous section originates from the period before crash .",
    "after the crash , the ihsg moments quickly converge to a gaussian distribution .",
    "in fact , this phenomenon has already been seen in the left panels of fig.[fig : distxyf0_bda ] , where the empirical probability of return to the origin is more scattered in the crash periods and after that .",
    "as in the previous section , investigation of the autocorrelation function from both stocks might also be of interest .",
    "the corresponding autocorrelation is shown in fig.[fig : auto_short_bda ] .",
    "although it is difficult to see how long the klse stock maintains its correlation , the ihsg stock index obviously becomes less correlated during and after the crash .",
    "this result can be understood by looking back to fig.[fig : momenti ] , i.e. after the crash the returns distribution becomes more random and therefore the index losses its memory .",
    "it might be more interesting if we compare results in this section with currency controls shown in the top panels of figs.[fig : ihsg_return ] and [ fig : klse_return ] .",
    "the government interventions on the exchange rate seem to create non natural economics activities which have a direct influence on the fluctuation of stock indices .",
    "once the currency is under - controlled , the fluctuations tend to significantly deviate from the gaussian distribution , which can be clearly seen in the ihsg moment before crash ( fig.[fig : momenti ] ) and the klse one after crash ( fig.[fig : momentk ] ) . from the investors point of view",
    "this is obvious , a less fluctuating exchange rate reduces the number of variables considered in estimating the future stock price .",
    "we have analyzed the ihsg and klse stock index returns using the methods developed for statistical physics . in spite of the limited number of data used in our analysis",
    ", we still found that both stock indices show the universal properties previously observed in the leading stocks such as s&p 500 and nyse , i.e. the scaling properties .",
    "the difference is , nevertheless , found in the time scale , the ihsg stock retains its scaling property longer than the klse one . as a consequence , the former is more correlated than the latter .    by investigating their statistical properties before , during , and",
    "after the financial crash it is found that the scaling behavior of the ihsg index originates from its fluctuation before the crash period . during and after the crash periods",
    "the index distributions are closer to gaussian and do not show a stable process . in the klse case ,",
    "the return distributions in all periods show an unstable process and depart from gaussian after the crash . one possible explanation to these different behaviors could be the currency control . besides these differences ,",
    "both stock indices show some similarities , namely both stocks become more volatile during and after the crash and their return moments become closer to gaussian during the crash .",
    "this work was supported in part by the quality for undergraduate education ( que ) project .",
