    "fits were also performed with the @xmath98 increased or decreased by 250 k. these changes had a minor systematic effect on the best - fit inclinations , with @xmath66 increasing by 1@xmath117 at @xmath118 k and decreasing by the same amount for @xmath119 k. these give a sense of the systematic uncertainties due to @xmath98 on modeling the ellipsoidal variations .",
    "another possible systematic error in the photometric modeling is the  veiling \" of the secondary if there is a significant contribution from disk light .",
    "qualitatively , veiling leads to an underestimate of the inclination as the amplitude of the ellipsoidal modulations is suppressed ( e.g. , casares et al .",
    "1993 ) . that the same inclination is derived for each of @xmath58",
    "implies either that veiling is not important , or that the effective temperature of the emitting region of the disk is the same as that of the secondary .",
    "future near - ir observations could improve constraints on a possible disk contribution to the light curve , though veiling may be present even toward redder wavelengths in low - mass x - ray binaries ( e.g. , kreidberg et al .",
    "2012 ) .    for the remainder of the paper",
    "we adopt @xmath120 .      with the measured spectroscopic semi - amplitude and period , mass ratio from the rotational broadening , and inclination from photometry",
    ", we have enough information to determine both the primary and secondary masses in the system .",
    "our estimate of the primary mass is @xmath121 , consistent with a massive neutron star .",
    "the secondary is @xmath122 .",
    "we emphasize that the uncertainties on these values are solely statistical and do not consider the systematic uncertainties described above in the derivation of the inclination .",
    "however , a substantial increase in the inclination would be necessary to reduce the inferred primary mass to a value consistent with a white dwarf rather than a neutron star : @xmath123 would imply a primary mass of @xmath124 . given the measured mass ratio , the minimum primary mass allowed is only @xmath125 , so the permitted mass range of a putative white dwarf primary is limited .",
    "in addition , a symbiotic star ( accreting white dwarf with giant secondary ) with a period of 5.4 d would be extraordinarily unusual  most have periods of at least hundreds of days ( belczyski et al .",
    "future x - ray observations can provide additional constraints on the inclination ; depending on the geometry of the accretion disk , inclinations above @xmath126 would produce x - ray dips or eclipses .",
    "the normalization of the best - fit light curve model gives the mean bolometric luminosity of the secondary .",
    "using the same marigo  ( 2008 ) isochrone discussed above , the bolometric correction to @xmath53 is 0.23 mag .",
    "given an observed mean @xmath53 mag of @xmath127 , the implied distance is 4.4 kpc .",
    "the principal uncertainty in this estimate is systematic , and realistically the distance is likely uncertain by at least 20% .",
    "the galactic coordinates of 1417 are ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 ) : the system is in the direction of the inner galaxy , but above the plane .",
    "the latitude corresponds to a height of @xmath130 kpc above the plane for a distance of 4.4 kpc .    using this distance , the proper motion of 1417 (  2.4 ) , and the radial velocity derived in  3.1 , we can derive the 3-d space motion of the system , which is ( @xmath131,@xmath53,@xmath132 ) = ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) km s@xmath12 ( for this estimate , a @xmath136 distance uncertainty of 0.5 kpc was assumed ) . while the uncertainties are large due to the corresponding substantial uncertainty in the optical proper motion , the 3-d velocity of the binary ( @xmath137 km s@xmath12 ) is consistent with that observed for other millisecond pulsars ( e.g. , gonzalez et al .",
    "2011 ) . given this high velocity , the system s current spatial location may not reflect its origin ; nonetheless , the modest evidence for subsolar metallicity in  3.2 would also be more consistent with an origin in the thick disk than the thin disk .",
    "the properties of the system are summarized in table 1 .      here",
    "we briefly consider whether it is plausible that the low - mass x - ray binary described in this paper is not associated with the _",
    "fermi_-lat source that prompted its discovery .",
    "the total galactic population of low - mass x - ray binaries is estimated to be @xmath138 ( jonker et al .",
    "2011 ) , with most located in the disk or bulge ; of the remainder , some will be more distant than the 4.4 kpc estimated for this source , or too faint to detect in x - rays . even optimistically assuming a population of @xmath139 low - mass x - ray binaries that meet these constraints , the space density would only be about 1 per 30 deg@xmath140 , giving a chance alignment probability of @xmath141 within the 95% _ fermi_-lat error ellipse of 1417 .",
    "even this estimate is sanguine , as the x - ray binary is located @xmath142 from the 3fgl _",
    "fermi_-lat centroid .",
    "we conclude that a chance alignment between the low - mass x - ray binary and 1417 is very unlikely .",
    "using spectroscopy and photometry we have shown that the _ fermi _ @xmath0-ray source 1417 is likely associated with a low - mass x - ray binary , whose primary is likely a neutron star of nearly @xmath1 . given the low mass of the hydrogen - rich giant secondary ( @xmath143 ) , it likely followed a standard evolutionary path for a low - mass x - ray binary with a neutron star primary , initiating case b mass transfer after leaving the main sequence .",
    "this indicates the system is likely to evolve into a standard millisecond pulsar with a he white dwarf companion at the end of the accretion phase .",
    "tauris & savonije ( 1999 ) argue that much of the mass in the accretion flow in neutron star binaries with giant secondaries is lost rather than accreted onto the neutron star . in this case",
    ", the inferred high mass of the neutron star implies that it was born with a mass above the standard @xmath124 .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached for psr j1614@xmath72230 , which has an accurate pulsar mass of @xmath144 measured via the shapiro delay ( demorest  2010 ) , though in this case the secondary is a co white dwarf that likely evolved from an intermediate - mass x - ray binary ( tauris et al .",
    "heavy neutron star masses have been inferred for some millisecond pulsars discovered via _ fermi _",
    "@xmath0-ray emission ( romani et al .  2012 ; schroeder & halpern 2014 ) .",
    "very few low - mass x - ray binaries that are actively accreting have been detected as _",
    "fermi_-lat sources ( acero et al .",
    "2015 ) , with the exception of the two of the three transitional millisecond pulsars ( de martino et al .  2010 ; stappers et al .",
    "in addition , bogdanov & halpern ( 2015 ) have shown that the _ fermi _ source 3fgl j1544.61125 is associated with an x - ray binary that exhibits optical and x - ray properties similar to the other transitional millisecond pulsars .",
    "the consistent presence of @xmath0-ray emission among accreting transitional millisecond pulsars motivates us to suggest that 1417 may also be a transitional millisecond pulsar .",
    "there is no evidence for a state change in 1417 over the last @xmath145 years : the css photometry shows a constant mean magnitude since 2005 (  2.4.1 ) , while psr j1023 + 0038 became brighter by @xmath146 mag during its recent change to the disk state ( halpern et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the origin of the @xmath0-ray emission in 1417 is uncertain . for most millisecond pulsars",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission is thought to come from the magnetosphere of the pulsar and be entirely unrelated to the secondary .",
    "the lack of radio emission and evidence for an accretion disk in this system suggests that this is unlikely to be the correct explanation in 1417 .",
    "indeed , in the transitional system psr j1023 + 0038 the @xmath0-ray emission increased by a factor of at least 5 during the recent state change when the pulsar became undetectable ( stappers et al .",
    "they hypothesized that the pulsar was enshrouded but still active , with the increase in @xmath0-ray flux coming from a shock between the pulsar wind and surrounding material , related to the re - appearance of an accretion disk .",
    "however , archibald et al .  ( 2015 ) show that j1023 + 0038 exhibits coherent x - ray pulsations in the high state that indicate accreted material is reaching the neutron star .",
    "this material ought to quench the pulsar , so it is not trivial to associate the @xmath0-ray emission with a pulsar wind .",
    "an alternative model is that the @xmath0-rays are due to the interaction between a relativistic jet and the surrounding material , or to synchrotron self - compton radiation produced at the boundary of the inner accretion disk ( papitto et al .",
    "2014 ; deller et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of 1417 ( @xmath147 erg s@xmath12 ) is consistent with the average value observed in the disk state of the known transitional millisecond pulsars ( linares 2014 ) , and could well suggest that mode switching is also occurring in 1417 , but is not resolved in our short x - ray observations due to the greater distance and hence lower flux of this source .",
    "the x - ray photon index ( @xmath148 ) is also consistent with the transitional objects in this state .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0-ray to x - ray luminosity is @xmath4 , which is substantially larger than that observed in the disk state for j1023 + 0038 , perhaps related to the giant companion .",
    "the transitional millisecond pulsars , including j1023 + 0038 ( deller et al .",
    "2015 ) , have been detected as flat - spectrum cm radio continuum sources in the low - mass x - ray binary state .",
    "the observed 10 ghz radio continuum flux density of j1023 + 0038 would correspond to @xmath14910 @xmath150jy at the inferred distance of 1417 , which is marginally detectable with southern radio interferometers .",
    "clearly , additional work is needed to characterize 1417 .",
    "continuing observations with _",
    "fermi_-lat could allow a measurement of @xmath0-ray variability of the source , which would help determine the origin of the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "radio observations at superior conjunction should be used to search for radio pulsations or provide strong constraints on their presence , although radio pulsar emission is not expected while the source has an accretion disk .",
    "improved photometric data and modeling could aid in constraining the systematic uncertainties on the mass estimate of the neutron star .",
    "observations of x - ray variability on short timescales , an improved x - ray spectrum , and the detection of radio continuum emission offer the best current hope for determining whether 1417 is a transitional millisecond pulsar .",
