    "mean - field ( mf ) theories provide us with a good first approximation to the nuclear structure problems .",
    "they are able to describe the saturation and the shell structure simultaneously , both of which are basic nuclear properties , based on effective nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) interactions . as far as we constrain to the non - relativistic approaches , most of the mf calculations have been performed with the skyrme interaction  @xcite .",
    "finite - range interactions have rarely been applied , except the gogny interaction  @xcite which has the gaussian form for the central channels .",
    "most popular parameter - sets of the skyrme and the gogny interactions have been adjusted mainly to the nuclear properties around the @xmath7-stability .",
    "however , it is a question whether such phenomenological effective interactions work well for nuclei far off the @xmath7-stability .",
    "for instance , whereas role of the tensor force in nucleus - dependence of the mf has attracted interest  @xcite , the tensor force is usually ignored in those parameter - sets .",
    "although direct application of the bare @xmath6 ( and @xmath8 ) interaction to the nuclear structure problems  @xcite is yet limited to light nuclei or made to medium - mass nuclei but with limited accuracy , guide from microscopic theories will be valuable even in heavy - mass nuclei .",
    "the michigan 3-range yukawa ( m3y ) interaction  @xcite , which was derived by fitting the yukawa functions to brueckner s @xmath9-matrix , has been used in nuclear structure as well as in low - energy nuclear reaction studies . there have been a few attempts applying the m3y - type interaction to mf calculations  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author has developed an m3y - type interaction which is applicable to the hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations .",
    "the original m3y interaction is incapable of reproducing the saturation and the spin - orbit splitting within the mf regime . to cure this problem",
    "a density - dependent contact term has been added and some of the strength parameters have been modified .",
    "such interactions , which have originally been derived from microscopic theories but are slightly modified from phenomenological standpoints , may be called _ semi - realistic _ interactions .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that semi - realistic @xmath6 interactions could give different shell structure from the widely used skyrme and gogny interactions .",
    "however , the pairing properties have not been taken into account in the parameter - set m3y - p2 that was proposed in ref .",
    "this implies that the singlet - even channel in m3y - p2 is not quite appropriate as long as the pairing interaction is taken to be consistent with the hf interaction , while this problem seems to be masked in the hf approximation . in order to apply semi - realistic interactions to the mf studies extensively ,",
    "we explore new parameter - sets of the m3y - type interaction , taking the pairing properties into account .",
    "special attention is paid also to role of the tensor force . using the recently developed algorithm  @xcite",

    "the projection operators on the singlet - even ( se ) , triplet - even ( te ) , singlet - odd ( so ) and triplet - odd ( to ) two - particle states are defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) expresses the spin ( isospin ) exchange operator .    we shall start from the m3y - paris interaction  @xcite , which will be denoted by m3y - p0 in this article as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we change none of the range parameters @xmath27 of m3y - p0 in @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in m3y - p0 ,",
    "the longest range part in @xmath28 is kept identical to the central channels of the one - pion exchange potential ( opep ) , @xmath31 .",
    "we also maintain this reasonable assumption .",
    "as is well known , the spin - orbit ( @xmath32 ) splitting plays a significant role in the nuclear shell structure . even though higher - order effects may account for the observed @xmath32 splitting  @xcite , it is desired to enhance @xmath29 in order to describe the shell structure within the mf regime .",

    "the saturation properties are important to describe many nuclei in a wide mass range .",
    "since it is still hard to describe accurately the saturation properties by the bare @xmath6 ( and @xmath8 ) interaction despite certain progress  @xcite , it will be appropriate to modify realistic effective interaction so as to reproduce the saturation properties .",
    "density - dependence in the effective interaction has been known to be essential in obtaining the saturation .",

    "the parameter @xmath35 in @xmath23 , power to @xmath36 , is taken to be @xmath37 , by which the incompressibility @xmath38 becomes close to a reasonable value as shown later .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath39 is not quite sensitive to @xmath38 , because the major source of the saturation lies in the te channel , not in the se channel  @xcite .",
    "although we simply assumed @xmath40 in m3y - p2  @xcite , this assumption makes it difficult to reproduce pairing properties and to avoid instability of the neutron matter  @xcite simultaneously . to overcome this problem",
    ", we adopt @xmath41 in the new parameter - sets . the difference between @xmath39 and @xmath35",
    "may be attributed to the difference in origin of the @xmath36-dependence ; the short - range repulsion in the bare @xmath6 interaction in the se channel while primarily the tensor force in the te channel .",

    "are also shown .",
    "in the set m3y - p3 , we keep both @xmath30 and the odd - channel ( so and to ) strengths in @xmath28 of m3y - p0 . the set m3y - p4 is obtained by assuming @xmath34 , while changing @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) substantially . in the set m3y - p5 , we somewhat modify @xmath50 and @xmath51 while keeping @xmath30 , so as to reproduce the binding energies of several doubly magic nuclei better than m3y - p3 , as will be shown in sec .

    "basic characters of the interactions are checked by the hartree - fock calculations for the infinite nuclear matter , and for the doubly magic nuclei .",
    "the singlet - even channels of the interactions , which are relevant to the pairing properties , are fixed from the even - odd mass differences in the sn isotopes , by using the hartree - fock - bogolyubov calculations .",
    "we further implement the hartree - fock and the hartree - fock - bogolyubov calculations for spherical nuclei , applying the new interactions . predicted shell structure depends on the effective interactions to certain extent .",
    "this may significantly affect location of the drip lines .",
    "the new semi - realistic interaction m3y - p5 correctly describes the experimental consequence that the heaviest bound oxygen is @xmath160o .",
    "we have argued location of the neutron drip line for the ca and the ni nuclei , and its relevance to the shell structure .",
    "variation of the single - particle ( s.p . ) energies , particularly contribution of the tensor force to it , is a current topic .",
    "it is suggested that the tensor force as well as the opep part of the central force play a significant role in the magic numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the neutron - rich region .",
    "it has been shown that the new semi - realistic interactions including the tensor force , m3y - p5 in particular , describe the variation of the s.p .",
    "levels fairly well in @xmath5 , @xmath71 and @xmath117 nuclei .",
    "it is remarked that this interaction can reproduce the variation of the s.p .",
    "energy difference in the sn isotopes without destroying the shell structure of the doubly magic nuclei .",
    "it will be of interest to apply the semi - realistic interactions to deformed nuclei , and to excited states via the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "both projects are in progress ( for the latter , see ref .",
