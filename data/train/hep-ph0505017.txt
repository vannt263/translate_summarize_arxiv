    "neutrino astronomy holds a great promise to explore the interiors of the dense astrophysical systems , which is not possible by any other existing means such as through the study of the cosmic - rays and/or the gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "it is mainly because once the neutrinos are produced in the distant cosmos , they are essentially unobstructed by the intervening background matter mainly owing to their _ weak _ interaction cross section . on the other hand , the cosmic - rays ( being the charged particles ) and the gamma - rays are either deflected or even considerably absorbed by the same intervening background matter , depending upon the energy @xcite .",
    "the presence of the proton component in the observed cosmic - ray flux for the entire energy range ( 1 gev @xmath7 gev ) , may already be signaling the anticipated existence of the neutrino astronomy .",
    "the search of neutrinos from the cosmos may help to find a unified explanation for the common origin of the ultra - high energy cosmic - rays and the high energy gamma - rays .",
    "the absolute levels of the astrophysical neutrino productions are determined / affected by the intervening background matter @xcite , the relative levels nevertheless do not .",
    "these thus remain important observables for the forthcoming detailed astrophysical neutrino searches .",
    "it is thus important to investigate the relative neutrino production levels in an astrophysical neutrino source ; as well as the changes that may occur in the relative composition of the neutrino flavors during their propagation to us .",
    "given the recent empirical evidences of the neutrino oscillations @xcite , it is timely to perform a reference study for the effects of the neutrino oscillations on the mixed intrinsic astrophysical neutrino flavor ratios during their propagation .",
    "further motivation is provided by the recent developments both in providing examples to use the astrophysical neutrinos not only to study the cosmos around us @xcite , but also to explore the properties of the neutrinos itself ( including those suggested beyond the standard model of particle physics ) @xcite .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 interactions as a source of the intrinsic astrophysical neutrino production .",
    "the first @xmath8 represent the cosmic - ray flux produced inside the source , whereas the second @xmath8 represent the medium contribution in the source .",
    "commonly cited examples of the astrophysical systems where the @xmath0 interactions play a role include the nearby astrophysical sources such as the earth atmosphere and the galactic plane / center region as well as other sources inside our galaxy .",
    "the more distant suggested astrophysical neutrino sources include the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite , and the sites of the gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite .",
    "we estimate the three intrinsic neutrino flavor ratios as a function of the neutrino energy and study the neutrino oscillation effects on these for neutrino energy ranging between 1 gev and @xmath9 gev .",
    "the energy dependence of the three intrinsic ratios has not been studied previously .",
    "we mainly investigate the particle physics aspects of the three ratios .",
    "a purpose of the present study is to provide a firm basis for the relevance of the neutrino oscillation effects for the forthcoming searches of the three astrophysical neutrino flavor ratios . as in order to determine the astrophysical source characteristics as precisely and as completely as possible via neutrinos",
    ", one needs to know the relevance of the distance to the source @xmath10 in the presence of the neutrino oscillations for the given neutrino energy @xmath11 , since the neutrino oscillations redistribute the intrinsic neutrino flavor ratios depending upon the value of the ratio @xmath12 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we estimate the three intrinsic astrophysical neutrino flavor ratios in some detail mainly within the framework of the quark - gluon string model ( qgsm ) . in section iii , we study the effects of the neutrino oscillations on these .",
    "we identify the range of the @xmath12 values where the commonly considered assumption of the averaging of neutrino oscillation probabilities may hold . in section iv",
    ", we briefly summarize the present status of the relevant detection strategies as well as the detector developments to search for the astrophysical neutrino flavor ratios . in section",
    "v , we present our conclusions .",
    "let us define the three intrinsic neutrinos flavor ratios as the @xmath13 , the @xmath14 , and the @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 with @xmath17 , for instance . clearly , @xmath18 .",
    "this ratio provides normalization for the other two ratios .",
    "the previous estimates for the @xmath15 ratio are between @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "however , the energy dependence of the three intrinsic neutrino flavor ratios was not studied .",
    "we use the following formula for computing the astrophysical neutrino flux spectrum f^0_(e)== d n_p _",
    "p(e_p ) , [ dnnu ] where @xmath11 is the neutrino energy .",
    "the cosmic - ray flux spectrum , @xmath21 , is given by @xcite _ p(e_p)=a ( e_p/)^ ^-2 ^ -1 ^ -1 ^-1 , [ cr - flux ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we use the above cosmic - ray flux spectrum for 1 gev @xmath7 gev .",
    "we are aware that the above cosmic - ray flux spectrum differs by few percent for @xmath24 gev as compared to the more recent compilation @xcite",
    ". however , this is of not much concern for our present study since we are primarily interested in studying the astrophysical neutrino flavor ratios here .",
    "moreover , later , we also study the effects of varying the exponent @xmath25 . in the above simplified picture ,",
    "it is assumed that all the hadrons and the relevant leptons decay before interacting with the medium of the astrophysical neutrino source .",
    "the representative proton number density inside the source is taken to be @xmath26 , and the representative distance @xmath27 inside the source is taken to be @xmath28 10 kpc , where 1 pc @xmath29 @xmath30 cm .",
    "these values are to merely represent the reference absolute levels for the three neutrino fluxes .",
    "as stated earlier , our main concern in this paper is to study their ratios and their energy dependence defined earlier which are obviously independent of the product @xmath31 .",
    "it is clear that the task of computing the @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ dnnu ] ) essentially relies on the evaluation of the differential cross section @xmath33 in the @xmath0 interactions .    in this work",
    ", we shall consider only the most dominant production channels for each neutrino flavor generation as the representative examples .",
    "namely , the @xmath1 meson for the electron and the muon neutrinos and the @xmath34 meson for the tau neutrinos .",
    "we employ the quark - gluon string model ( qgsm ) to calculate the production distributions of the above mesons .",
    "the qgsm approach is non - perturbative and is based on the string fragmentation .",
    "it contains a number of parameters determined by the experiments @xcite .",
    "the production cross section of the hadron @xmath35 in the qgsm is given by , [ qgsm ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is the parallel ( perpendicular ) momentum of the secondary hadron @xmath35 in the center of mass frame .",
    "all the related formulas are provided in the appendix .",
    "we have used the vegas multi - dimensional monte carlo integration program @xcite to obtain the energy distribution of the neutrino flux by selecting the events falling inside the considered energy segment through a series of boosts to the laboratory frame .",
    "we have simplified the secondary decays of the charged leptons , the @xmath40 and the @xmath41 , as effectively the two body ones , that is , a neutrino plus a particle with varying invariant mass .",
    "for instance , we assume that the @xmath41 lepton decays into a @xmath42 and a particle @xmath43 with the mass @xmath44 satisfying 0.1 gev @xmath45 gev . in our setting @xmath46 .",
    "we take the @xmath47 branching ratio as @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the following processes in the qgsm : pp & & ^ ( _ ) + x + & & e_e _ , + pp & & d_s^ ( _ ) + x + & & _ + y. [ no - label ] the tau neutrino production via the @xmath34 meson can also be calculated in the perturbative quantum chromo dynamics ( pqcd ) through @xmath49 .",
    "however , the electron and the muon neutrino production through the @xmath50 meson can not be handled in the pqcd .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "there are many quark - level sub - processes ( the @xmath51- , the @xmath52- as well as the @xmath53-channel ) for the @xmath1 production in the @xmath0 interactions , differently from the @xmath54 production which has only the @xmath55 pair production channel . without some cuts such as on the @xmath56 or some cuts on the factorization scale etc .",
    ", the light quark productions may blow up as they approach the non - perturbative region .    in the pqcd calculations , we use the leading - order results of the parton sub processes @xmath57 where @xmath58 for @xmath59 [ and @xmath60 for @xmath61 . we use a @xmath62 factor , @xmath63 , to account for the nlo corrections . for the parton distribution functions",
    ", we use the cteqv6 @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 as a factorization scale . for the @xmath69 production through the @xmath55",
    ", we use the peterson fragmentation function with @xmath70 for fragmentation of @xmath71 or @xmath72 into the @xmath73 meson @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the three intrinsic neutrino flavor fluxes as a function of the neutrino energy @xmath11 .",
    "we plot @xmath74 in units of @xmath75s@xmath76sr@xmath76 as a function of the @xmath11 .",
    "since the tau neutrino production via the @xmath2 can be dealt with in both the pqcd and the qgsm , the pqcd result for the tau neutrinos is also presented for comparison .",
    "we note that there is a relatively large discrepancy at higher energy ( @xmath77 gev ) between the two approaches for the @xmath78 production .    to consider an example of the process that may produce the three neutrino flavors without hadronizing in the @xmath0 interactions , we have studied the @xmath79 channel .",
    "here , the neutrino energy distributions are not effected by the hadronization process .",
    "the neutrino production in the @xmath80 is reliably calculable in the pqcd . here , we consider the direct decays of @xmath51 into each lepton ( with @xmath81 branching ratio ) and include the secondary decays of massive leptons ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) .",
    "note that all the lepton masses are very small as compared to the top quark mass , as a result all the three neutrino distributions are of the same orders of magnitude .",
    "these results are also shown in the fig .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the three neutrino fluxes are comparable for this process .",
    "compared to the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 results , the @xmath84 contributions are negligible , less than a factor of at least @xmath85 over the whole range of the considered energies .",
    "it can also be seen from the figure that the production of the @xmath1 , the @xmath54 , and their branching ratios of relevant leptonic decays are more important than the effects of the lepton masses .",
    "our results are in good agreement for the @xmath86 and the @xmath87 production with those given in the ref .",

    "@xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the three intrinsic neutrino flavor ratios defined earlier , as a function of the neutrino energy @xmath11 .",
    "we note that an energy independent relative flux hierarchy among the three intrinsic neutrino flavor ratios persisted even at the highest considered energy , namely @xmath88 for 1 gev @xmath3 gev . our results are however subject to the uncertainties of extrapolating the parameters of the hadron / quark production models especially for @xmath89 gev .",
    "this corresponds to center - of - mass energy of @xmath90 gev . to our knowledge",
    ", the qgsm parameters are fitted up to @xmath91 540 gev using the sps collider data for the light mesons , whereas for the charmed mesons the comparison is available using the @xmath91 630 gev data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the energy dependence of the two intrinsic ratios of the astrophysical neutrino fluxes , the @xmath14 and the @xmath15 , by varying the exponent @xmath25 of the cosmic - ray flux spectrum , @xmath21 [ see eq .",
    "( [ cr - flux ] ) ] , in the range @xmath92 .",
    "it is so because the cosmic - ray flux spectrum in an astrophysical source is expected to be harder than the observed one locally @xcite .",
    "we note that the ratio @xmath15 changes from @xmath93 to @xmath94 , when the @xmath25 changes from @xmath95 to @xmath96 for 1 gev @xmath3 gev .",

    "in this section , we shall perform a three neutrino oscillation analysis of the three intrinsic neutrino flavor ratios estimated in the previous section . in the context of the three neutrino flavors ,",
