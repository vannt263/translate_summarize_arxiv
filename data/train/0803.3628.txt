    "the theory of `` accidental '' touching of energy bands in crystals has been recognized and studied since the early days of the quantum theory of solids.@xcite by accidental , one means that the touching is not required by symmetry .",
    "a spectacular example of current interest is the dirac point degeneracy of graphene , which leads to a host of interesting behavior.@xcite another class of heavily studied theoretical examples are the dirac points appearing in problems of two dimensional electrons moving in periodic potentials in a magnetic field studied by hofstadter@xcite and others .",
    "three dimensional dirac points occur in models of unusual `` spin hall insulators '' occurring with strong spin - orbit interactions.@xcite in all these cases , despite the accidental nature of the band touching , it is robust to perturbations of the hamiltonian .",
    "this robustness has its origin in _ momentum space topology _ of the bloch wavefunctions.@xcite for instance , in graphene , each dirac point is a source of a @xmath0 delta - function flux of berry curvature , so that the line integral of the berry connection , @xmath1 for any curve @xmath2 enclosing a dirac point .",
    "if time reversal and inversion symmetries are maintained , the berry curvature vanishes identically except at points of band crossing , and conservation of its flux protects the band crossings comprising the dirac points .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the topological protection behind a completely different instance of accidental band touching , which occurs in a broad class of `` frustrated '' hopping models . the models which we will consider actually display in addition to band crossings a more dramatic phenomena : the presence of one or more",
    "_ completely flat bands_. models with flat bands are particularly interesting physically because in this case the effect of interactions is wholly non - perturbative : interactions can reconstruct the states within the flat band manifold without any cost in kinetic energy .",
    "this is a powerful mechanism for generating complex and interesting many - body states , as attested by the richness of the fractional quantum hall effect , which occurs as a result of the flat band degeneracy of landau levels of electrons in a magnetic field .",
    "the frustrated hopping models we consider here arise in other contexts , e.g. the description of magnons in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets , and the motion of cold atoms in p - wave bloch bands optical lattices .",
    "when the density of particles described by such frustrated hopping models is sufficiently low , short - range interactions of arbitrary ( weak or strong ) strength lead to particle localization into a variety of crystalline patterns that are model specific.@xcite these states are analogous to the wigner crystal states of electrons in the lowest landau level ( lll ) , which indeed occur for sufficiently small filling factor .",
    "these states can be understood as follows . from the flat band",
    ", one can construct single particle wannier states ( superpositions of wavefunctions with all momenta ) which are strictly localized , i.e. have support on only a small finite number of sites .",
    "while wannier states may always be constructed , only for the case of a flat band do they remain one - particle eigenstates .",
    "when interactions also have finite range and are repulsive , multiple particles can be present in spatially separated localized states with zero interaction cost , and the corresponding many - body wavefunction remains a many - body eigenstate .",
    "if the flat band has the minimum kinetic energy , such a state minimizes simultaneously kinetic and interaction energy , and is therefore a ground state .",
    "such states are generically possible for particle densities below some `` close packing '' threshold , at which interaction cost becomes inevitable .",
    "the states precisely at this threshold density are usually ( but not always ) periodic crystalline configurations .    in the case of electrons in the lll",
    ", the more interesting fractional quantum hall states occur _ above _ this filling factor , when there is some unavoidable interaction cost .",
    "however , because of the presence of a ( large ) gap between the lll and the first ll , the interactions act entirely within the former .",
    "the zoo of fractional quantum hall states is understood primarily from studies of the coulomb interaction _ projected _ into the lll subspace .",
    "a very interesting question is whether any similar richness of behavior might occur , above the close packing threshold , when interactions are included in the frustrated hopping models discussed here .",
    "this would appear a promising place to search for exotic orderless quantum spin liquid phases , loosely analogous to fractional quantum hall liquids , that have been hypothesized to occur e.g. in frustrated magnets@xcite .",
    "at this point the band touchings re - enter the picture as a _ hindrance _ to this search .",
    "the projection of the hamiltonian into the lowest energy flat band is strictly controlled only when there is a gap between this band and the higher dispersive ones , and when this gap is large compared to the strength of interactions . in the vast majority of frustrated hopping models ( we will catalog many below ) , the gap actually vanishes due to touchings of the first excited band with the flat one at specific points in momentum space . before attempting to surmount this obstacle , it is crucial to know in each case whether this touching can removed by some small change in the hamiltonian , or whether it somehow enjoys protection that makes a search for such perturbations fruitless .",
    "the result of this paper is that in many cases the crossing _ is _ protected , and can only be removed by perturbations that also destroy the flatness of the low energy band . like the protection of the dirac points of graphene and others discussed above",
    ", the mechanism for this stability is topological .",
    "however , because of the localized character of the states in the flat band , the topological structure lies in _ real space _ rather than momentum space . specifically , the band touchings can be associated with eigenstates whose support is extended along _ non - contractible loops _ crossing a ( toroidal ) sample with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : kagome - lattice - model ] , we describe in detail the structure of local and topological loop states for one of our simplest examples , the nearest - neighbor hopping model on a kagome lattice .",
    "we show how counting of these states requires band touching . in sec .",
    "[ local_eigenstates in various models ] , we give a more abbreviated presentation of the generalization of these arguments to various other frustrated lattices . finally , we conclude with a discussion in sec .  [ discussion ] .",
    "an appendix ( [ appendix1 ] ) describes an additional model with further - neighbor interactions without band touchings .",
    "the simplest model we will consider is the nearest neighbor tight hopping hamiltonian on the kagome lattice , @xmath3 where the indices @xmath4 denote the sites of the kagome lattice , @xmath5 denotes nearest neighbor pairs of sites , and the particles can be either fermions or bosons .",
    "we use this simple model to demonstrate all the generic flat band features discussed above .",
    "aside of providing concrete examples for all the unique features of flat bands , the analysis of the kagome model also proves a good model with which to develop the techniques we will use throughout this manuscript .      the band structure of eq .",
    "( [ hopping ] ) consists of a single flat band with energy @xmath6 and two dispersive bands with @xmath7 where @xmath8 here @xmath9 are the three shortest bravais lattice vectors for the kagome ( and triangular ) lattice .",
    "our conventions are described succinctly in fig .",
    "[ fig : convention ] . the upper dispersive band @xmath10 touches the flat band at the @xmath11 point @xmath12 .",
    "the hopping term in the band basis is of the form @xmath13 where the momentum integration is over the first brillouin zone , and we use @xmath14 for the band index , and @xmath15 for the basis index .",
    "the new operators @xmath16 are related to the original operators by a unitary transformation . in particular ,",
    "momentum eigenstates of the flat band consist of @xmath17 with @xmath18 , where the greek index arithmetic is always modulo 3 , and @xmath19 .",
    "we can construct localized eigenstates by taking the linear combinations @xmath20 with @xmath21 being some normalization . here and elsewhere",
    "we will use @xmath22 to denote the creation operator for the localized eigenstates .",
    "choosing @xmath23 to be the position at the center of an hexagonal plaquette of the lattice , and normalizing the operator we find @xmath24 where the indices @xmath25 enumerate the 6 successive sites around the hexagonal plaquette , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kagome_1 ] .",
    "these local operators are very useful , but they are unfortunately _ not _ canonical bosons or fermions .",
    "rather , if @xmath26 are bosonic , the commutation relations are @xmath27 =   \\delta_{{\\bf r } , { \\bf r ' } } - \\frac{1}{6 } \\gamma_{{\\bf r } , { \\bf r ' } } \\ ; , \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] where the matrix @xmath28 is the adjacency matrix of the _ triangular _ lattice formed by the centers of the plaquettes . for fermions ,",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) holds with the commutator replaced by an anticommutator .",
    "the localized model can be understood directly in real space by considering a single triangle around the boundary of the plaquette .",
    "one of the corners has an amplitude of @xmath29 , a second has @xmath30 and a third has @xmath31 amplitude . the hopping amplitude from the first and second sites onto the third site",
    "cancels _ out .",
    "thus the eigenstate is localized as a result of _ destructive interference _ , which is a very useful guiding principle in identifying these states in other flat band models . for a strictly localized wavefunction to be an eigenstate , the sum of hopping amplitudes onto sites outside the support of the wavefunction must vanish ( see for illustration fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary_pic ] ) .    one can create similar exact single - particle eigenstates on larger loops , by summing over the plaquette states on a number of contiguous plaquettes , and normalizing the state by the length of the boundary of the area covered by the plaquettes @xmath32 here @xmath33 denotes the area covered by the plaquettes , and @xmath34 denotes the length of the boundary of this area . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kagome_1 ] we show one example of a three - plaquette loop .    .",
    "the phases are denoted by @xmath35 signs next to the relevant lattice sites.,width=288 ]      we now turn to the main question addressed in this paper , of the origin of the band touching .",
    "we will show that the set of localized eigenstates contains too many states to fit into the flat band alone .",
    "specifically , the dimension of the space of localized state with the _ energy _ of the flat band has a dimension which is @xmath36 larger than that of the flat band .",
    "this requires a contribution from a state of another band , which , since it is continuous , must touch the flat band at one point .    because the difference in question involves only a finite number of basis states ( here @xmath36 , but there may be more in other examples in the next section ) , it is necessary to consider a large but finite system to make this counting precise .",
    "it is advantageous to use periodic boundary conditions ( with a finite integral number of unit cells in each of two directions ) , since in this case the bloch states in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) remain eigenstates ( with discrete @xmath37 ) in the finite system .",
    "we must count carefully the number of linearly independent states with energy @xmath38 .",
    "the plaquette states created by eq .  , navely all seem linearly independent , since they occur on different plaquettes . with open boundary conditions , the sum over all the plaquettes in the lattice leads to a state of the form of eq .   at the boundary of the system . for periodic boundary conditions ( putting the lattice on a torus )",
    ", however , this sum _ vanishes _ since there is no boundary @xmath39 .",
    "so when considering the hilbert space spanned by the plaquette states   we have only @xmath40 independent states , where @xmath41 is the number of plaquettes ( and unit cells ) in the lattice .",
    "this accounts for all but one state of the flat band .",
    "the missing state is accounted for by a non - contractible loop around the torus . by decorating such a loop with alternating plus / minus signs , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kagome_2 ] , one again satisfies the conditions for destructive interference of outgoing waves , and the associated wavefunction represent an exact eigenstate , with the flat band energy .",
    "this state can not be expressed as a sum of plaquette operators , or it would be possible to contract the loop just as any sum of plaquette states is .",
    "we have therefore found the missing state ! however , we have an embarrassment of riches  there is not one such non - contractible loop , but _",
    "two_. in total we have @xmath42 states , all with the _ same _ energy . from the band structure",
    "we know the flat band contains precisely @xmath41 states , and so the additional state must come from another band , and for this reason one of the dispersive bands touches the flat band at exactly one point .",
    "in fact , from the loop states we can construct the plane wave bloch state which touches the flat band explicitly . by taking an equal weight linear superposition of the non - contractible loops translated in any direction other than that",
    "along which the loop runs , one obtains a state with the same configuration in any unit cell , which therefore has the bloch form with momentum @xmath12 .",
    "the double degeneracy of states with @xmath12 signifies that not only must one of the dispersing bands touch the flat band at a point , but that the point is at @xmath12 .",

    "taking the nearest neighbor hopping model on the pyrochlore lattice ( instead of the kagome lattice ) has two degenerate flat bands at @xmath43 , and two dispersive bands @xmath44 , where we have used the conventions @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for the ( fcc ) bravais lattice vectors , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the pyrochlore basis .",
    "both flat bands touch the upper dispersive band at @xmath12 .",
    "the _ same _ localized plaquette modes that appear in the kagome model , are exact eigenstates for this pyrochlore model as well . however , whereas the number of hexagonal plaquettes in the kagome lattice is equal the number of unit cells , in the pyrochlore lattice the number of plaquettes is 4 times that of the number of unit cells . with two flat bands containing only @xmath52 states ,",
    "clearly these are not all linearly independent .",
    "consider a volume enclosed by 4 plaquettes ( see fig  [ fig : pyro ] ) .",
    "placing plaquette states with equal weight , and appropriate relative signs , on each one of these 4 faces gives a total of _",
    "zero_. there are @xmath52 such cells in the pyrochlore lattice , and therefore @xmath52 such constraints .",
    "this reduces the number of independent states we can construct out of the plaquette states to @xmath52 .",
    "we choose to keep all the plaquette states for the plaquettes perpendicular to two out of the 4 @xmath53 directions of the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "now if we consider any one of the kagome planes along the two directions we chose above , we have the same additional constraint as in the kagome lattice - putting a plaquette state on every plaquette in the plane , with periodic boundary conditions results in _",
    "zero _ , giving us one additional constraint .",
    "taking into account the cell - constraints from the previous paragraph , there are only _ two _ such linearly independent planes , so we have two additional constraints , reducing the number of linearly independent states we can construct from the plaquette states to @xmath54 . as in the kagome lattice , we now have the non - contractible loop states to consider . in the pyrochlore lattice",
    "there will be 3 such non - contractible loops rather than 2 .",
    "therefore , in total we have @xmath55 states with the same energy of the flat bands .",
    "exactly as argued in the kagome case , these particular non - contractible loop states can be made into @xmath12 states , and we therefore have 3 degenerate states at @xmath12 . the only way for the band structure to comply with this is to have one of the dispersive bands touch the two flat bands at the @xmath12 point which indeed is the case .",
    "the nearest neighbor hopping model can give rise to a flat band on other lattices as well .",
    "we considered one example of a 2d lattice , and one example of a 3d lattice . in this subsection",
    "we shall mention one additional 2d lattice - the dice lattice , for a number of reasons .",
    "first , as opposed to the kagome and pyrochlore lattices , in this model the flat band touches dispersive bands at momenta other than @xmath12 .",
    "second , it will be useful to compare between two different hopping models on this lattice , that both produce a flat band .",
    "the analysis essentially follows the same steps as in the kagome lattice model , and so we will not elaborate how the results were obtained .",

    "the nearest neighbor hopping model has one flat band at @xmath56 touching two dispersive bands @xmath57 ( with @xmath58 the same as defined in the introduction ) at the two momentum points @xmath59 ( with the bravais lattice vectors taken with length 1 ) . adding an on - site potential which does not break the symmetries of the lattice(for instance an energy cost @xmath60 to be on a 6-coordination site )",
    ", one can gap one of the two dispersive bands away from the flat band , and only two degenerate points will remain .",
    "therefore , our counting arguments will have accounted for @xmath61 states with the energy of the flat band .",
    "the localized eigenstates of the dice lattice model are different than those of the kagome and pyrochlore lattices . rather than residing in a loop around one or a number of plaquettes , the simplest localized states here have nonzero weight on the 6 sites neighboring a central coordination-6 site with alternating signs , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dice ] .    as for the kagome and pyrochlore lattices ,",
    "a sum over all the localized states surrounding every 6-coordinated site , can produce zero with periodic boundary conditions @xmath62 .",
    "apart from these _ two _ constraints , the localized states are all independent .",
    "the number of coordination-6 sites on the lattice is the same as the number of unit cells , and so we have accounted for @xmath63 states . as in the kagome and pyrochlore models",
    ", we will find eigenstates composed of non - contractible loops around the torus .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dice ] we show one of the two non - trivial loop states which exist for this model , with the weights being integer powers of the factor @xmath64 , for a total of 4 non - contractible loop states .",

    "in both cases , the hopping amplitude from sites 1 and 2 cancels out .",
    "similar considerations for the other sites of the localized states yield the same result . for the non - contractible loop state ,",

    "naively , all these states ( type i and ii ) on different area units are linearly independent ,",
    "resulting in @xmath52 states that exhaust the number of states in the flat bands .",

    "we have found that the presence or absence of band touchings can be understood for a variety of frustrated hopping models by a careful counting of linearly independent localized states .",
    "crucial to this counting is the presence , which we found for all the models examined here , of non - contractible loop states . in all cases ,",
    "a vanishing superposition of the localized states was found , always involving a sum over area patches that cover the entire lattice , but some with different weights in the summation ( non - zero @xmath88 for instance ) .",

    "the counting , for the case of a single flat band , is as follows .",
    "the total number of independent states with the flat band energy is @xmath89 , where @xmath41 is the number of unit cells , @xmath90 is the number of localized state independent superpositions that vanish ( the number of missing states ) , and @xmath91 is the number of different ` flavors ' of non - contractible loop states for each of the @xmath92 handles of the torus ( in @xmath92 dimensions ) . when this is larger than @xmath41 , the flat band is degenerate with some other band , at a finite number of points in momentum space .",
    "we have referred to the hopping models discussed in this paper as `` frustrated '' , simply because ( apart from the p - orbital honeycomb example ) , they reside on lattices exhibiting strong geometrical frustration for antiferromagnetism .",

    "it is interesting to consider , however , a possibly more direct connection between flat bands and frustration . indeed , somewhat rough arguments suggest that , fairly generally , the classical spin hamiltonian with exchange @xmath104 has an extensive ground state degeneracy when the lowest energy eigenstates of @xmath103 form a flat band .",
    "we discuss some additional conditions below .",
    "the connection between flat bands and ground state degeneracy is through the luttinger - tisza method for finding ground states of classical spin models .",

    "the solution is @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the @xmath115 eigenstate of @xmath103 , and the @xmath116 is an unknown vector of real coefficients for each @xmath117 .",
    "the total number of variables that may be varied is then @xmath118 real numbers for each @xmath117 , and hence @xmath119 real numbers .",
    "now we can attempt to impose the necessary constraints to get a physical minimum for the classical spin model . these consist of one constraint per spin on the spin magnitude .",
    "if the lattice contains @xmath120 spins in its basis ( i.e. sites in the unit cell ) , then this gives @xmath121 constraints .",
    "subtracting the number of constraints from the number of variables gives a total of @xmath122 degrees of freedom remaining for physical minima of the classical spin model .",
    "thus , for @xmath123 , we are led to expect an extensive degeneracy ( macroscopic entropy ) of spin ground states",
    ". this counting is certainly crude , and since the normalization constraints are non - linear , not entirely rigorous .",
    "for instance , if @xmath124 , it is probably the case that extensive ground state entropy may or may not be present , depending upon other details of the model .",
    "this is born out , for instance , by the case of the nearest neighbor kagome model , for which there is indeed an extensive ground state entropy , while @xmath125 .",
    "however , we believe the conclusion provides a reasonable qualitative guide , though the estimate of the entropy density is probably unreliable .",
    "thus a large @xmath96 hubbard model with a kinetic energy with flat minimum energy bands indeed , when @xmath126 , exhibits macroscopic ground state entropy , the classic signature of frustration .",
    "the discussion in this paper is only a prelude to the study of interacting bosons and fermions in flat band systems . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "this is understood in generality only for low density , below the appropriate `` close packing '' threshold . in this case",
    "the ground states are completely localized and minimize simultaneously the kinetic and interaction energies . above this close packing density ,",
    "the problem becomes much more intricate , and it is reasonable to expect delocalized `` liquid '' ground states .",
    "how to attack the problem in the range of densities for which the particles can still be accommodated in the flat band(s ) but above close packing is an interesting open problem .",
    "it is intriguing to speculate that liquid states in this regime , at least for weak interactions , may have unconventional properties . with the increasing accessibility of such hamiltonians in ultra - cold atomic systems in optical lattices , clarification of this regime may well come experimentally rather than theoretically .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge congjun wu and sankar das - sarma for early collaboration on related work , and john chalker , for illuminating discussions .",
    "l.b . was supported by the packard foundation and the national science foundation through .",
    "having identified a connection between frustrated magnetic models and flat bands , we examine one additional model - one inspired by ref .  , and mirroring its geometric structure . the magnetic model in ref .",
    "has been shown to support a spin liquid ground state .",
    "the magnetic model hamiltonian consists of exchange interactions of equal strength on 3 different link types .",
    "this is described by an exchange matrix .",
    "we take this same matrix structure and construct a simple tight binding model with it .",
    "the hamiltonian is precisely of the form of eq .   with the indices corresponding to the lattice sites of the kagome lattice .",
    "the hopping amplitudes are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfg ] , and we will refer to this hopping model as the kagome-3 model .        our analysis finds the band structure of this model consists of _ two _ degenerate flat bands at energy @xmath127 and one dispersive band @xmath128 with @xmath58 the _ same _ function introduced in the introduction .",
    "the single dispersive band has a minimum energy of @xmath129 at @xmath12 , and a maximum energy of @xmath130 at wavevector @xmath131 in our conventions .",
    "the flat bands are therefore _ gapped _ from the dispersive band with a gap of @xmath132 .",
    "the convention we use for the 3 vectors illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : convention ] , is @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "proceeding as for the other models in this paper , the localized states we find are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kagome_bfg2 ] , and live on `` bowtie '' plaquettes . as in the pyrochlore lattice , naively there are 3 different `` flavors '' of bowtie plaquettes ( and localized states ) .",
    "these can most easily be identified by considering how many bowties states involve a single up - pointing triangle ( corresponding to a unit cell ) .",
    "were these states all linearly independent , we would have @xmath137 states in the flat band , rather than @xmath138 ( here as before , @xmath41 is the number of unit cells ) .",
    "however , taking a bowtie plaquette state , rotating it around a hexagonal plaquette to produce 6 bowtie plaquette states around the hexagon ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : local ] ) , and finally summing these 6 wavefunctions , produces zero . for each hexagonal plaquette ,",
    "of which there are @xmath41 , there is one such constraint , and we find there are only 2 flavors of independent bowtie states - marked @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ fig : kagome_bfg2 ] .      as in all the other examples we give in this manuscript ,",
    "there are additional non - local constraints , which mandate the existence of non - contractible loop states .",
    "the constraints we find involve vanishing summations over the bowtie plaquette states of type a ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kagome_bfg2 ] ) , with wavevectors @xmath140 ( but _ not _",
    "@xmath141 ) .",
    "in the exact same manner , the sums over the type b plaquette states , with wavevectors @xmath142 ( but _ not _",
    "@xmath143 ) , also vanish .",
    "we therefore have 4 constraints , and since there are a total of @xmath52 flat band states , we expect 4 non - contractible loop states to exist .",
    "these can easily be found graphically , and are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopstates ] .        as in section  [ gapped1 ]",
    ", we find that in order for gapped flat bands to appear , we needed two different localized eigenstates occupying the same area unit , as well as non - contractible loop states that are not associated with one of the two sets of local eigenstates ."
