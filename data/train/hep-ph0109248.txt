    "the radiative transitions @xmath5 are among the most valuable probes of flavour physics .",
    "although they are rare decays the cabibbo - favoured @xmath6 modes are experimentally accessible already at present .",
    "the inclusive branching fraction has been measured to be @xmath7 combining the results of @xcite .",
    "the branching ratios for the exclusive channels have been determined by cleo @xcite , and more recently also by babar @xcite and belle @xcite to give the averaged values : @xmath8 on the theoretical side , the flavour - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) reactions @xmath5 are characterized by their high sensitivity to new physics and by the particularly large impact of short - distance qcd corrections @xcite .",
    "considerable efforts have therefore been devoted to achieve a full calculation of the inclusive decay @xmath6 at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in renormalization group ( rg ) improved perturbation theory @xcite ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .    whereas the inclusive mode can be computed perturbatively , using the fact that the @xmath9-quark mass is large and employing the heavy - quark expansion",
    ", the treatment of the exclusive channel @xmath1 is in general more complicated . in this case bound state effects are essential and",
    "need to be described by nonperturbative hadronic quantities ( form factors ) .",
    "the basic mechanisms at next - to - leading order were already discussed previously for the @xmath3 amplitudes @xcite . however , hadronic models were used to evaluate the various contributions , which did not allow a clear separation of short- and long - distance dynamics and a clean distinction of model - dependent and model - independent features .    in this",
    "talk we present the results of @xcite where a systematic analysis of the exclusive radiative decays @xmath3 ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) in qcd , based on the heavy quark limit @xmath12 , was performed .",
    "we quote factorization formulas for the evaluation of the relevant hadronic matrix elements of local operators in the weak hamiltonian .",
    "a similar subject was treated in @xcite .",
    "factorization holds in qcd to leading power in the heavy quark limit .",
    "this result relies on arguments similar to those used previously to demonstrate qcd factorization for hadronic two - body modes of the type @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this framework allows us to separate perturbatively calculable contributions from the nonperturbative form factors and universal meson light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcda ) in a systematic way .",
    "this includes the treatment of loop effects from light quarks , in particular up and charm .",
    "such loop effects are straightforwardly included for the inclusive decays @xmath5 . for the exclusive modes ,",
    "however , the effects from virtual charm and up quarks have so far been considered to be uncalculable `` long - distance '' contributions and have never been treated in a model independent fashion .    finally , power counting in @xmath14 implies a hierarchy among the possible mechanisms for @xmath3 transitions .",
    "this allows us to identify leading and subleading contributions .",
    "for example , weak annihilation contributes only at subleading power in the heavy quark limit .    within this approach",
    ", higher order qcd corrections can be consistently taken into account .",
    "we give the @xmath3 decay amplitudes at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "furthermore numerical values for cp - asymmetries and isospin - violating ratios are given .",
    "after including nlo corrections the largest uncertainties still come from the @xmath15 form factors , which are at present known only with limited precision ( @xmath16 ) , mostly from qcd sum rule calculations @xcite .",

    "the last convolution integral in ( [ h8 ] ) can be performed explicitely and leads to a combination of gegenbauer moments of @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "there are further mechanisms that can in principle contribute to @xmath34 decays .",
    "one possibility is weak annihilation . in this case",
    "the leading - power projection onto the meson @xmath30 vanishes because the trace over an odd number of dirac matrices is zero .",
    "a non - vanishing result arises from the subleading - power projections onto @xmath73 and @xmath74 . despite its power suppression ,",
    "the dominant annihilation amplitude can be computed within qcd factorization .",
    "this is because the colour - transparency argument applies to the emitted , highly energetic vector meson in the heavy - quark limit @xcite .",
    "since weak annihilation is a power correction , we will content ourselves with the lowest order result ( @xmath75 ) for our estimates below .",
    "in particular , we shall include the annihilation effects from operators @xmath76 to estimate isospin - breaking corrections in @xmath2 decays .",
    "the reason for including this class of power corrections is that they come with a numerical enhancement from the large wilson coefficients @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) and are not ckm suppressed .",
    "instead , a ckm suppression of annihilation effects occurs for @xmath1 and these contributions are thus very small in this case .",
    "finally , we can combine these results and write , adding the up- and charm- quark contribution , @xmath79   \\langle v\\gamma|q_7|\\bar b\\rangle\\ ] ] where , at nlo , the factorization coefficients @xmath80 are given as @xmath81 here the nlo expression for @xmath82 @xcite has to be used , while the leading order values are sufficient for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "numerically we obtain for central values of all input parameters , at @xmath85 , and displaying separately the size of the various correction terms : @xmath86{cccc } -0.3221 & + 0.0113 & -0.0820 - 0.0147i & -0.0144 - 0.0109i\\\\ c_7^{lo } & \\delta c_7^{nlo } & t^i_{1,8}\\mbox{-contribution } &     t^{ii}_{1,8}\\mbox{-contribution}\\\\ \\end{array } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & -0.4072 -0.0256i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note a sizable enhancement of the leading order value , dominated by the @xmath87-type correction .",
    "a complex phase is generated at nlo , where the @xmath87-corrections and the hard - spectator interactions ( @xmath88 ) yield comparable effects .",
    "the net enhancement of @xmath89 at nlo leads to a corresponding enhancement of the branching ratios , for fixed value of the form factor .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bkrhomu ] , where we show the residual scale dependence for @xmath90 and @xmath91 at leading and next - to - leading order .     and @xmath92 on the renormalization scale @xmath93 .",

    "the dotted line shows the lo , the dash - dotted line the nlo result including type - i corrections only and the solid line shows the complete nlo result.,title=\"fig:\",height=302 ]    as expected , the inclusion of the hard - vertex corrections ( @xmath87 ) reduces the scale dependence coming from the wilson coefficients .",
    "the scale dependence of the complete nlo result is `` deteriorated '' because the type - ii contributions appear at @xmath22 for the first time and therefore introduce a completely new scale dependence .    for the decay @xmath94 both sectors of the effective hamiltonian have the same order of magnitude .",
    "the amplitude for the cp - conjugated mode @xmath2 is obtained by replacing @xmath95 .",
    "we may then consider the cp asymmetry @xmath96    it is substantial for the @xmath97 modes and much less dependent on the form factors . here",
    "the largest theoretical uncertainty comes from the scale dependence .",
    "this is to be expected because the direct cp asymmetry is proportional to the perturbative strong phase difference , which arises at @xmath22 for the first time .",
    "unknown power corrections could have some impact on the prediction .",
    "a further interesting observable is the charge averaged isospin breaking ratio @xmath98 within our approximations , isospin breaking is generated by weak annihilation .",
    "isospin breaking was already discussed in @xcite , partially including nlo corrections .",
    "@xmath2 also depends sensitively on fundamental ckm parameters , such as @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and can thus in principle serve to constrain the latter quantities once measurements become available .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : acpiso ] , where the dependence on @xmath100 is shown for @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .     as a function of the ckm angle @xmath100 for three values of the renormalization scale @xmath103 , @xmath50 and @xmath104 .",

    "another application of our results concerns an estimate of u - spin breaking effects in @xmath3 decays @xcite .",
    "let us state here only that u - spin breaking effects can be sizeable .",
    "for further details we refer to @xcite .",
    "in this talk we have presented a systematic and model - independent framework for the exclusive radiative decays @xmath3 based on the heavy - quark limit .",
    "this allowed us to compute the decay amplitudes for these modes consistently at next - to - leading order in qcd .",
    "an important conceptual aspect of this analysis is the interpretation of loop contributions with charm and up quarks , which come from leading operators in the effective weak hamiltonian .",
    "we have argued that these effects are calculable in terms of perturbative hard - scattering functions and universal meson light - cone distribution amplitudes .",
    "they are @xmath22 corrections , but are leading power contributions in the framework of qcd factorization .",
    "this picture is in contrast to the common notion that considers charm and up - quark loop effects as generic , uncalculable long - distance contributions .",
    "non - factorizable long - distance corrections may still exist , but they are power - suppressed .",
    "another important feature of the nlo calculation are the strong interaction phases , which are calculable at leading power .",
    "they play a crucial role for cp violating observables .",
    "we have seen that weak - annihilation amplitudes are power - suppressed , but can be numerically important for @xmath2 because they enter with large coefficients .",
    "these effects also turn out to be calculable and were included in our phenomenological discussion at leading order in qcd .",
    "finally , a numerical analysis leads to our predictions for the branching ratios @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and for the cp asymmetries @xmath107 and @xmath108 for central values of the input parameters .",
    "the uncertainties for the branching ratios are of @xmath109 where the form factors @xmath110 and @xmath111 taken from @xcite clearly dominate this uncertainty .",
    "this situation however can be systematically improved . in particular",
    ", our approach allows for a consistent perturbative matching of the nonperturbative form factor to the short - distance part of the amplitude .",
    "power corrections are not expected to be unreasonably large because with the annihilation contribution we have included the probably numerically largest of these corrections .",
    "furthermore there are no chirally enhanced power corrections in the vector meson wave functions .",
