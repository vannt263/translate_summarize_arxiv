    "classical or thermal phase transitions are special points in parameter space where the free energy is not analytic as a consequence of strong thermal fluctuations , see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "it is customary to distinguish between second - order or continuous phase transitions , where the order parameter ( op)@xcite goes to zero continuously at the transition , and first - order or discontinuous ones , where the order parameter displays a discontinuity .",
    "classic examples for the former are the ferromagnetic transition at the curie temperature in zero magnetic field , or the liquid - gas transition at the critical point ; for the latter , a ferromagnet below the curie temperature in a magnetic field , or the liquid - gas transition below the critical pressure .",
    "the nonanalytic free energy translates into singular behavior of observables . at a second - order transition , this usually takes the form of power laws , in which case the singularity is characterized by critical exponents .",
    "let @xmath0 be the order parameter ( in the case of a ferromagnet , @xmath0 is the magnetization , in the case of a liquid - gas transition , the density difference between the phases ) , @xmath1 the external field conjugate to the order parameter , and @xmath2 the dimensionless distance from the critical point for @xmath3;@xcite at a thermal phase transition , @xmath2 is usually chosen to be the distance from the critical temperature @xmath4 , @xmath5",
    ". then the specific heat @xmath6 behaves as @xmath7 , the order parameter @xmath0 vanishes according to @xmath8 , the order - parameter susceptibility @xmath9 diverges according to @xmath10 , etc.@xcite @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are examples of critical exponents . underlying all of these singularities is a diverging length scale , the correlation length @xmath14 .",
    "it measures the distance over which order - parameter fluctuations are correlated , and diverges as @xmath15 , which defines the exponent @xmath16 .",
    "two other important critical exponents are @xmath17 , which describes the behavior of the order parameter as a function of its conjugate field @xmath1 at criticality , @xmath18 , and the exponent @xmath19 , which describes the decay of the order - parameter correlation function at criticality , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the spatial dimensionality .",
    "the critical exponents are not all independent . at most classical transitions",
    ", it turns out that specifying two exponents determines all of the others .",
    "this was recognized early on and put in the form of exponent relations ( also referred to as `` scaling relations '' , or `` scaling laws '' ; the latter not to be confused with the homogeneity laws that are often called `` scaling laws '' ) .",
    "for instance , the six exponents @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath17 , @xmath19 , and @xmath16 are related by the four relations listed in eqs .",
    "( [ eqs : b.1 ] ) .",
    "these were initially derived from scaling assumptions , i.e. , generalized homogeneity laws for various observables near a critical point , and later understood more deeply in terms of the renormalization group ( rg ) , which allowed for a derivation of the homogeneity laws .",
    "some of the exponent relations are more robust than others .",
    "for instance , for a @xmath22-theory in @xmath23 spatial dimensions , the widom , fisher , and essam - fisher scaling relations expressed in eqs .",
    "( [ eqs : b.1 ] ) remain valid , whereas the hyperscaling relation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : b.1d ] ) , fails .",
    "this is related to the notion of dangerous irrelevant variables ( divs ) , i.e. , coupling constants that flow to zero under rg transformations but that some observables depend on in a singular way . as a result , `` strong scaling '' ,",
    "i.e. , a simple homogeneity law for the free energy , breaks down . more generally , there are constraints on the critical exponents that take the form of inequalities .",
    "they rely on much weaker assumptions than strong scaling and in some cases are rigorous .",
    "examples are the rushbrooke inequality , eq .  ( [ eq : b.5 ] ) , and the lower bound for the correlation - length exponent @xmath16 in disordered systems that is discussed in appendix  [ app : c ] .    a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) occurs by definition at zero temperature , @xmath24 , as a function of some non - thermal control parameter such as pressure , composition , or an external magnetic field.@xcite the critical behavior at @xmath24 is governed by quantum fluctuations rather than thermal ones .",
    "the role of temperature is thus different from that at a thermal transition , which necessitates the introduction of additional critical exponents .",
    "for instance , the order - parameter susceptibility will vary as @xmath25 , with @xmath2 the dimensionless distance at @xmath26 from the critical point , but as @xmath27 as a function of temperature for @xmath28 , with @xmath29 in general different from @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , we need to define exponents @xmath30 and @xmath31 that describe the behavior of the order - parameter and the correlation length , respectively , as functions of the temperature in addition to @xmath2 .",
    "the case of the specific heat @xmath32 is less straightforward since @xmath32 vanishes at @xmath24 even away from any critical point .",
    "related to this , in the thermodynamic identity that underlies the rushbrooke inequality the specific - heat coefficient @xmath33 appears . for the purpose of discussing quantum phase transitions",
    "it therefore is sensible to define critical exponents @xmath34 and @xmath35 that describe the critical behavior of the specific - heat coefficient according to @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . for thermal phase transitions",
    ", @xmath38 obviously coincides with the ordinary specific - heat exponent @xmath11 . for qpts ,",
    "we define @xmath11 and @xmath39 in terms of the susceptibility @xmath40 given by the second derivative of an appropriate free energy with respect to @xmath2 ; the physical meaning of this susceptibility depends on the nature of @xmath2 .",
    "the definition of critical exponents discussed in this paper is summarized in appendix [ app : a ] , and we will refer to the exponents @xmath11 , @xmath34 , @xmath12 , etc . as the @xmath2-exponents , and to @xmath39 , @xmath35 , @xmath30 , etc . as the @xmath41-exponents .",
    "the concepts of scaling , and exponent relations , also carry over to dynamical critical phenomena.@xcite a dynamical critical exponent @xmath42 is defined by how the critical time scale @xmath43 scales with the diverging correlation length @xmath14 : @xmath44 . in the case of thermal phase transitions ,",
    "the dynamics are decoupled from the statics , and the static exponents can be determined independently of @xmath42 . at quantum phase transitions",
    "this is not true since the statics and dynamics are intrinsically coupled .",
    "however , as we will show , at @xmath24 there still are many exponent relations that involve the static exponents only .",
    "a further complication is the fact that multiple critical time scales , and hence multiple dynamical exponents @xmath42 , which do occur at classical transitions @xcite but are not common , are the rule rather than the exception at quantum phase transitions .    interestingly , the same concepts can also be applied to first - order phase transitions .",
    "fisher and berker @xcite have developed a scaling description of classical first - order transitions and have shown that they can be understood as a limiting case of second - order transitions or critical points .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to thoroughly discuss these concepts in the context of quantum phase transitions .",
    "while scaling concepts have been used since the notion of quantum phase transitions was invented , the issue of multiple dynamical exponents and its interplay with dangerous irrelevant variables has never been systematically discussed .",
    "similarly , the importance of exponent relations has not been stressed in this context , and even the distinction between @xmath2-exponents and @xmath41-exponents is not always clearly made .",
    "in the first part of the paper we discuss scaling concepts for quantum phase transitions in general , with an emphasis on which aspects can be taken over from classical phase - transition theory and which ones require modifications or new ideas . in particular , we show that the specific - heat coefficient shows scaling behavior that sets it apart from other observables and is not in direct analogy to the classical case , and we derive exponent relations that involve the specific - heat exponents .",
    "exponent relations have proven very useful in the classical context , since they provide stringent checks for whether experiments are actually in the asymptotic region .",
    "they are expected to be similarly useful for qpts .",
    "we also generalized the scaling theory for thermal first - order transitions by fisher and berker@xcite to the quantum case .",
    "in the second part of the paper we apply all of these concepts to the problem of the quantum ferromagnetic transition in metals .",
    "this transition is known to be generically first order in clean systems , and second order in disordered ones , and it has multiple dynamic critical exponents , which allows for an illustration of all of the ideas developed in the first part .",
    "it also displays many crossover phenomena the understanding of which is crucial for the interpretation of experiments .",
    "these crossovers can be phrased in terms of fixed points , originally discussed by hertz,@xcite that become unstable asymptotically close to the transition .",
    "the experimental relevance of hertz s fixed point in disordered systems in particular is discussed here for the first time .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] we derive exponent relations for the quantum case , both for the usual exponents and for those unique to qpts , and we generalize the notion of scaling at a first - order transition to the quantum case . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] we apply our results to the problem of the quantum ferromagnetic transition in metals , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] we conclude with a general discussion",
    ". definitions of common critical exponents are given in appendix [ app : a ] , and various classical exponent relations are recalled in appendix [ app : b ] .",
    "appendix [ app : c ] summarizes the harris criterion and its generalization for the correlation - length exponent in systems with quenched disorder .",
    "in this section we discuss some very general points related to the role of dangerous irrelevant variables and multiple time scales in the context of quantum phase transitions .",
    "the classical exponent relations recalled in appendix [ app : b ] fall into two distinct classes : the widom , essam - fisher , and fisher relations hold quite generally , including the case of systems above an upper critical dimensionality .",
    "by contrast , the hyperscaling relation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : b.1d ] ) , holds only below an upper critical dimension , when no dangerous irrelevant variables ( divs ) are present . at quantum critical points",
    "the role of divs is more complex than in the classical case .",
    "a div can affect the temperature scaling of an observable , and it can do so with or without also affecting the static scaling .",
    "we will refer to the assumptions underlying scaling that can or can not be altered by divs as `` strong '' and `` weak '' scaling assumptions , respectively , and to the resulting scaling behavior as `` weak scaling '' and `` strong scaling '' .",
    "we will further distinguish between weak and strong static and dynamic scaling as appropriate . with this nomenclature ,",
    "hyperscaling in the usual sense is a special case of strong static scaling .",
    "( note that weak scaling is more robust than strong scaling . )",
    "the div concept is more important for quantum phase transitions than for classical ones , since the latter are more likely to be above their upper critical dimension and strong scaling is more often violated .    to illustrate these points ,",
    "consider an observable @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 $ ] be the scale dimension of @xmath45 as determined by power counting within the framework of an appropriate field theory , and define a critical exponent @xmath47 by the critical behavior of @xmath45 as a function of the dimensionless distance from criticality at @xmath24 , which we denote by @xmath2 : @xmath48 .",

    "[ eq:2.1b ] this does not remain true if there is an irrelevant variable that is dangerous with respect to the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath45 .",
    "this changes the value of @xmath47 , but usually it does not change the fact that @xmath45 obeys a homogeneity law .",
    "weak static scaling thus still holds in general,@xcite as expressed by ( r , t=0 ) = b^-/_o(rb^1/ , t=0 )  .",
    "[ eq:2.2 ] the value of @xmath47 is now affected by the pertinent div and can no longer be determined by scaling arguments alone , even if @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath16 are known .",

    "now consider the temperature dependence of @xmath45 and define a critical exponent @xmath50 by @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the dynamical exponent as obtained from the underlying field theory by power counting .",
    "( for now we assume there is only one such @xmath42 , we will generalize to the case of multiple dynamical exponents below . )",
    "strong dynamical scaling then is expressed by a homogeneity law [ eqs:2.3 ] ( r , t ) = b^-/_o(rb^1/ , tb^z )  , [ eq:2.3a ] which yields _ t = /z  .",

    "so far we have assumed that there is a single underlying dynamical exponent @xmath42 that may or may not be modified by a div .",
    "an additional complication is that often more than one dynamical exponent is present .",
    "this can happen at classical phase transitions,@xcite but it is much more common at quantum phase transitions , chiefly because there are more soft or massless modes at @xmath24 than at @xmath56 .",
    "for instance , at any quantum phase transition in a metallic system the coupling of the order parameter to the conduction electrons introduces a second time scale : a ballistic one ( @xmath57 ) in clean systems , or a diffusive one ( @xmath58 ) in disordered ones.@xcite this issue is independent of whether or not divs invalidate strong scaling , so for simplicity we will assume strong scaling in this subsection .    for definiteness ,",
    "let as assume that there are two critical time scales with dynamical exponents @xmath59 and @xmath60 . the generalization of the homogeneity law ( [ eq:2.1a ] ) for @xmath45 then reads ( r , t ) = b^-[o]_o(rb^1/ , tb^z_1 , tb^z_2 )  .",
