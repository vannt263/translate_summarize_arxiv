    "studies of the scaling properties of fluctuations have played an important role in developing the theory of equilibrium critical phenomena , and they also proved to be instrumental in exploring systems driven far from equilibrium where fluctuations often diverge in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in particular , finding critical exponents through finite - size ( fs ) scaling has become a standard method for establishing universality classes @xcite-@xcite and , furthermore , the shapes of the distribution functions of fluctuations have also been used as hallmarks of universality classes for both equilibrium @xcite-@xcite and non - equilibrium systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one of the most studied distribution of critical order - parameter fluctuations is that of the two dimensional classical @xmath0 model .",
    "the model is important in itself since it serves as a prime example of an equilibrium phase transition with topological order @xcite .",
    "recent interest comes also from a suggestion that its critical magnetization distribution , @xmath15 , may describe the fluctuations in a remarkable number of diverse far - from - equilibrium steady states .",
    "examples range from the energy - dissipation in turbulence @xcite and interface fluctuations in surface evolution @xcite to electroconvection in liquid crystals @xcite , as well as to river - height fluctuations @xcite . in some of the examples , such as the surface growth problems described by the edwards - wilkinson model @xcite",
    ", one can establish a rigorous link to the low - temperature limit ( spin - wave approximation ) of the @xmath0 model .",
    "furthermore , the non - gaussian features of @xmath15 such as its exponential and double exponential asymptotes appear to have generic origins @xcite , thus explaining the observed collapse in a remarkable set of experimental and simulation data . in the majority of the examples , however , the experiments or simulations provide data of insufficient accuracy to decide unambiguously about the universality class .",
    "indeed , it is not easy even to observe the changes occurring in @xmath15 if the @xmath0 model is considered at finite temperatures where the spin - wave approximation breaks down @xcite .    in order to be more confident about universality claims ,",
    "one would like to be able to examine the distribution functions in more details . a well known and much investigated method of extracting additional information in critical systems such as the zero - temperature @xmath0 model is the study of the fs behavior @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the implication of fs scaling is that the appropriately scaled distribution function has a well defined limit when the system size tends to infinity ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "a frequently used scaling variable is the centered and normalized magnetization @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "this choice of scaling variable eliminates possible divergences in @xmath19 and , in general , produces a non - degenerate limit distribution @xmath20 @xcite : @xmath21 the function @xmath2 can be expressed in a compact form for the zero - temperature @xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "its large-@xmath4 limit , @xmath20 , has been numerically evaluated and compared with simulations and experiments on a variety of systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "once the limit distribution is known , one can investigate the approach to @xmath20 as the system size increases .",
    "as we shall show below , keeping the leading and the next to leading terms , the fs corrections , @xmath22 , to the limit distribution can be written as @xmath23 we kept two terms since the asymptotic @xmath4-dependence of the leading term differs from the next one only by a slowly varying logarithmic factor .",
    "indeed , our calculation yields the amplitudes @xmath24 in the following form @xmath25 here , the coefficient @xmath26 of the logarithmic term can be expressed through the catalan constant @xmath27 as @xmath28 .",
    "the coefficients of the @xmath29 terms are @xmath30 ( giving @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( for details , see sec.[fss_section ] ) .",
    "a remarkable result about the function @xmath33 characterizing the leading shape correction to the limit distribution is that it can be expressed through @xmath20 as @xmath34 ' \\,,\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the derivative over @xmath3 .",
    "the second scaling function @xmath35 is more complex in the sense that it can not be expressed through a finite sum of the derivatives of the limit distribution .",
    "however , it can be calculated efficiently using integral representations as explained in sec.[fss_section ] [ see eq . ] and in appendix [ appendix_b ] [ see eq . ] .    evaluating the scaling functions @xmath36 numerically",
    ", one observes that @xmath37 already for small systems ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this leads to one of the main conclusions of our work , namely that the fs corrections to the limit distribution can be written to an excellent accuracy in the following form @xmath38^\\prime\\,.\\ ] ] the above expression can be easily calculated and compared with experiments and simulations using both the scaling of the amplitude and checking the shape of the correction .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath33 is uniquely determined by the limit distribution , thus the leading shape correction has the same universality attributes as the limit distribution itself . in renormalization group language ,",
    "the meaning of the above result is that the eigenfunction corresponding to the direction of slowest approach to the fixed point distribution can be expressed through the limit distribution .",
    "a simple and transparent derivation of an analogous result for the case of the central limit theorem can be found in @xcite .    in order to show the workings of the method of fs scaling",
    ", we carried out monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the @xmath0 model in its low - temperature limit , including its @xmath14-limit .",
    "we examined the fs corrections described above for the lattice of size @xmath39 , as an illustration , and found close agreement between the theoretical and mc results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the @xmath0 model and the zero - temperature magnetization distribution",
    "is described in sec.[model ] .",
    "next , the fs corrections are calculated in sec.[fss_section ] with the technicalities relegated to two appendices ( the direct calculations of the needed cumulants are found in appendix [ appendix_a ] , while an integral representation that simplifies the evaluation of finite - volume sums is presented in appendix [ appendix_b ] ) . finally in sec.[mc_sect ] , and as an illustration , we have compared the fs results with the mc simulations for a lattice of size @xmath39 .",
    "the two - dimensional , classical @xmath0 model on a square lattice is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath40 where the angle variables @xmath41 describe the orientation of unit vectors in the plane , @xmath42 is the ferromagnetic interaction strength between nearest neighbor vectors on a periodic , @xmath43 square lattice . from now on we will set @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which defines the energy- and length scales in the problem .",
    "the order parameter @xmath46 whose probability distribution is of our interest is defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the instantaneous average orientation .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of the magnetization , @xmath15 , has been much studied @xcite .",
    "its zero temperature limit ( @xmath49 ) has been first calculated @xcite by using the spin - wave approximation @xmath50 and summing up the moments series for the pdf .",
    "another , field - theoretic , approach for obtaining @xmath15 is based on evaluating the fourier transform of the partition function of the system in a loop expansion @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath51-loops contribution corresponds to the @xmath52 contribution , where @xmath53 is the system temperature .",
    "correspondingly , the expansion up to one - loop gives exactly the zero - temperature limit of @xmath15 .",
    "both of the above methods yield an identical result to leading order . the second method , however , shows explicitly how to compute the higher temperature corrections to @xmath15 through an effective , @xmath53-dependent lattice propagator , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is independent of @xmath53 @xcite , and is defined by its fourier representation as @xmath56 here , the components of the vector @xmath57 are @xmath58 , where @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 such that the lattice momentum @xmath62 lies in the first brillouin zone : @xmath63 .",
    "hence the pdf at @xmath14 can be obtained by the well known ` @xmath64 ' expression of the one - loop result @xcite @xmath65 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the centered and normalized magnetization @xmath66 , and the coefficient @xmath67 is defined as the particular @xmath68 case of the general expression : @xmath69 the pdf in eq .",
    "agrees with the corresponding formula obtained in @xcite , ( see eq.(26 ) therein ) .    in fig.[pdf_1loop_fig ]",
    "we plot @xmath2 as a function of @xmath3 using eq.([analytic_pm ] ) for different @xmath4 values",
    ". on the right panel , we display a zoom into the region close to the peak of the distribution functions .",
    "it can be clearly seen that @xmath2 tends towards an asymptotic distribution @xmath20 as @xmath16 and , furthermore , one observes that the convergence is fast .",
    "nevertheless , in experiments , the value of @xmath4 is not known and deviations from @xmath20 are observed .",
    "they are often explained away as finite - size effects and thus leaving the universality claims not entirely justified .",
    "we would like to emphasize that there is information in the fs corrections ( shown on fig.[pdf_1loop_fig ] around the peak of the pdf ) and , by evaluating these corrections , one may refine the reasoning for or against finding a universality class .",
    "as explained in sec.[model ] , the pdf of the magnetization for the @xmath70 @xmath0-model at @xmath14 is given by the 1-loop analytic expression of eq.([analytic_pm ] ) , and the numerical evaluation of the @xmath71 limit distribution , @xmath20 , can be carried out with an excellent precision .",
    "the aim of this section is to present the steps of the calculation of the leading and next - to - leading fs corrections to the limit distribution .",
    "we start by expanding the logarithm in the exponential on the r.h.s . of eq.([analytic_pm ] ) which allows rewriting the equation in terms of the coefficients @xmath72 defined by eq ..",
    "after rescaling the integration variable by @xmath73 , we obtain @xmath2 as the following fourier integral @xmath74 where we have defined : @xmath75 the @xmath4 dependence of the above sum is in the coefficients @xmath72 which have a finite non - zero thermodynamic limit @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "thus , in order to compute the fs behavior of @xmath2 , we shall have to determine the fs corrections to @xmath78 @xmath79 assuming that @xmath80 is known , we can write @xmath81 as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the thermodynamic limit of @xmath81 : @xmath84 and the fs corrections , due to @xmath85 and @xmath80 for @xmath86 , are written separately @xmath87 the separation of the @xmath85 and the @xmath88 contributions is partly motivated by their @xmath71 asymptotic behaviors .",
    "it will be shown in the appendices that @xmath89 while for @xmath86 , @xmath90 .",
    "thus the leading correction comes from @xmath91 and the sum in eq .",
    "determines the shape ( the functional form ) of the leading correction .",
    "as it turns out , the same shape correction can be easily separated from the @xmath92 contributions for @xmath86 . indeed , for large @xmath51 , one has @xmath93 , and one can write ( cf . eqs . , and )",
    "@xmath94 where the second term is suppressed relative to the first one by a factor @xmath95 . substituting the above split of @xmath80 into eq . , one can see the emergence of the same sum as in eq . , and it allows us to write @xmath96 where the @xmath4-dependent amplitudes are given by @xmath97 while the corresponding @xmath4-independent functions by @xmath98 integral representations for @xmath99 and @xmath100 are given in eqs . and , respectively , in appendix b.    inserting eq . into eq .",
    ", we obtain the pdf of the @xmath70 @xmath0-model at zero - temperature , including its leading fs corrections @xmath101 here @xmath102 and @xmath103 since @xmath104 , one can evaluate @xmath33 through @xmath20 by carrying out the appropriate integrations by part on the r.h.s .",
    "of eq .. the outcome is one of the main results of our work , namely a simple expression is obtained for the leading shape correction in terms of the limit distribution ( as quoted in eq . ) : @xmath105^\\prime.\\ ] ] the second shape correction @xmath35 can not be related to @xmath106 in such a simple manner but can be readily evaluated using eqs . and of the appendix [ appendix_b ] .",
    "the functions @xmath33 and @xmath35 are displayed in fig.[fss_phi1_phi2_fig ] .",
    "a general property of these functions is that their 0@xmath107 , 1@xmath108 and 2@xmath109 moments are zero .",
    "this follows from their definition as being corrections to a centered and normalized probability distribution , and can be explicitly verified using their definitions , e.g. eq ..    in order to determine the amplitudes in front of the shape corrections , we have to calculate the fs behavior of @xmath80 for @xmath110 .",
    "this problem is addressed in details , using two distinct methods , in the appendices [ appendix_a ] and [ appendix_b ] .",
    "it is found there that the asymptotic @xmath4-dependence of @xmath85 has the form @xmath111 ( cf .",
    "while @xmath80 behaves as @xmath112 for @xmath113 ( cf .",
    "eqs . , and ) .",
    "an important result of these calculations is the amplitude of @xmath33 given by @xmath114 where the coefficient @xmath26 is obtained analytically @xmath115 with @xmath27 being the catalan constant , while @xmath116 and @xmath117 are determined numerically .",
    "the amplitude @xmath7 is the second main result of our work since the fs corrections are dominated by the @xmath118 term .",
    "indeed , @xmath119 is small , @xmath120 , already for @xmath121 and it decreases with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , evaluating @xmath35 numerically , one finds that apart from the neighborhood of the zeros of @xmath33 , the inequality @xmath122 holds for @xmath13 as seen in fig.[a1phi1_vs_a2phi2_fig ] .",
    "it should be mentioned that there is some freedom in separating the two contributions @xmath118 and @xmath123 in eq .. one can replace @xmath35 by @xmath124 changing simultaneously @xmath125 to @xmath126 in @xmath7 , eq .. our choice of separating the leading large-@xmath51 asymptote of @xmath80 in eqs . and leads naturally to a function proportional to @xmath33 and also results in a remnant that is small already for small values of @xmath4 .",
    "this choice is convenient , since it allows to write the fs correction in a compact form [ see eq . ] with a very good accuracy as demonstrated in fig.[dphil_vs_a1phi1fig ] .",
    "it is remarkable that the dominant correction term @xmath118 also emerges from a simple assumption about the pdf written in its original variable .",
    "namely , if we assume that one can write @xmath127 with @xmath128 for @xmath71 , we find that @xmath129 .",
    "using then the scaled variable @xmath3 , the expression @xmath130 becomes @xmath118 .    as discussed above ,",
    "there are other choices for separating a contribution proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "it should be clear , however , that the freedom is irrelevant when the sum of the two contributions @xmath131 is used . as expected , and as can be seen in fig.[fss_corr_analys_fig ] , the convergence is fastest when the sum of both corrections are used .",
    "here , we briefly demonstrate that the calculated fs corrections can be observed in simulations .",
    "it is clear that increasing the system size and improving the statistics by increasing the number of monte carlo samples , the leading fs corrections , as seen in fig.[fss_corr_analys_fig ] , will emerge from the analysis .",
    "the question is whether the leading corrections we calculated could be seen already in small systems with reasonable simulation effort .",
    "we have thus performed mc simulations on a @xmath70 @xmath0-model of size @xmath121 and computed @xmath132 . since our analytic results eqs.- pertain to the @xmath133 limit of the system , we made simulations deep in the low @xmath53 region ( @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) using the over - relaxation metropolis ( orm ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "in addition , simulations of the @xmath133 limit itself could also be carried out since there the spin - wave approximation applies which yields independent modes with gaussian action whose simulation is straightforward @xcite .    in the simulation using orm , we typically measured observables using @xmath136 sweeps , and the errors were estimated by using a binning method .",
    "on fig.[fss_corr_analys_mc_fig ] , the red line shows the fs corrections to @xmath106 displayed as the difference @xmath137 computed from the integral representation of eq .. it is compared with data obtained by orm at very low temperatures @xmath134 ( green circles ) and @xmath138 ( asterisk markers ) .",
    "the magenta points represent the results from the simulation of the gaussian action at @xmath14 .",
    "the statistical errors on all the data points displayed are smaller than the point size , which is not surprising for the quoted large number of mc sweeps . from the actual statistical error @xmath139",
    "one can find that a relatively small number , @xmath140 sweeps are enough to reach an accuracy @xmath141 , one tenth of the maximal fs correction .",
    "as one can see , the simulation temperatures used are small enough for the temperature corrections to be small compared to the fs corrections at @xmath121 .",
    "it can also be seen that the the sum of the two leading fs correction terms , @xmath142 ( blue dashed line ) is quite close to the exact result . of course , @xmath121 is a rather small system to expect full agreement of the calculated leading fs corrections with the full fs correction .",
    "looking at fig.[fss_corr_analys_fig ] , however , one notes that increasing the size of the system by only a factor three would yield a complete domination of the leading fs corrections over the higher order fs corrections .",
    "thus , we conclude that observing the leading fs corrections is feasible in relatively small systems at relatively small computational coast . based on this observation",
    ", we expect that a meaningful analysis of fs corrections in experimental @xmath0 systems is also possible .",
    "we have computed the leading fs corrections to the pdf of the magnetization of the @xmath70 @xmath0-model at zero temperature .",
    "two scale - independent functions @xmath33 and @xmath35 were found with their amplitudes behaving with system size as @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the function @xmath33 can be expressed through the limit distribution @xmath20 and its low - order derivatives .",
    "this makes it a candidate for identifying universality features hidden in fs corrections .",
    "the leading and next to leading corrections were found to describe the fs behavior very accurately already for small system size .",
    "thus , as our mc simulations demonstrated , the observation of the calculated fs corrections is possible in model systems .",
    "we expect that their experimental observation may also be feasible .",

    "we begin by deriving the large-@xmath4 asymptotic expansion for @xmath67 defined in eq.([gndef ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to write this equation in the form : @xmath145^{-2 } \\nonumber\\\\      & = & g_2^\\infty + \\delta g_2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum goes from @xmath146 , to @xmath147 and prime means that the @xmath148 term is left out . the asymptotic value @xmath149 is given by @xmath150 where @xmath27 is the catalan s constant .    in the fs correction @xmath85 ,",
    "the sum giving the coefficient of @xmath29 diverges logarithmically with @xmath4 .",
    "this leading term is obtained as @xmath151 it is worthwhile to mention that the @xmath152 decay of @xmath85 is consistent with the logarithmic fs corrections of some related quantities reported in @xcite .",
    "the above expression for @xmath85 can be generalized to perform a high precision fit of the form : @xmath153 to @xmath154 computed numerically using eq . for a large range of @xmath4 values @xcite .    in fig.[g2_fit_fig",

    "the sum appearing in the @xmath29 correction term @xmath80 converges for @xmath71 hence one can extend the summation to @xmath162 ( up to an error decreasing faster than @xmath29 ) .",

    "<S> an integral representation of the cumulant generating function , known from earlier works , is used for the numerical evaluation of @xmath2 , and the limit distribution @xmath5 is obtained with high precision . </S>",
    "<S> the two leading finite - size corrections @xmath6 are also extracted both from numerics and from analytic calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the amplitude @xmath7 scales as @xmath8 and the shape correction function @xmath9 can be expressed through the low - order derivatives of the limit distribution , @xmath10'$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the second finite - size correction has an amplitude @xmath11 and one finds that @xmath12 already for small system size ( @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the feasibility of observing the calculated finite - size corrections by performing simulations of the @xmath0-model at low temperatures , including @xmath14 . </S>"
