    "<S> both dft and tddft require the knowledge of the exchange - correlation ( xc ) potentials , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> although the exact xc potentials exist in principle , they are never known for non - trivial systems , making us resort to approximations .    </S>",
    "<S> the potentials now overwhelmingly used in applications are local functions of the electron density or also of its spatial derivatives , the local - density approximation ( lda ) @xcite and the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite , respectively . while very simple and efficient in implementations , these approximations suffer from well known deficiencies . </S>",
    "<S> the one of our concern here will be the inherent dimensionality dependence of both lda and gga , i.e. , their having distinct 3d , 2d , and 1d versions , which makes them unreliable and even poorly substantiated in the case of the systems of intermediate dimensionality , such as quasi - low - dimensional materials . </S>",
    "<S> a truly first - principles xc functional , being one and the same for all systems , must work equally well for different dimensionalities , including the intermediate ones . the exact exchange ( exx ) [ or optimized - effective potential ( oep ) ] @xcite stands out in dft as a first - principles potential not , in particular , bound to any specific dimensionality . </S>",
    "<S> this potential obeys a number of important requirements of the exact theory , such as the correct asymptotic behavior @xmath4 for finite systems , the support of image states at surfaces and in low - dimensions @xcite , it produces @xcite the derivative discontinuity in the energy dependence on the fractional electrons number @xcite , and it is free from self - interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent version of the exx theory has been developed @xcite and found to support the excitonic effect in semiconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for all the advantages , an unfortunate drawback of the exx theory is the extreme complexity of its implementation . </S>",
    "<S> it is the orbital - dependent formalism which involves the solution of the notoriously tedious oep integral equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has prevented exx from becoming widely used in applications , and even qualitative insights are often obscured by heavy numerical difficulties .    </S>",
    "<S> it , therefore , came recently as a surprise that for the quasi - low - dimensional electron gas ( qldeg ) with only one band populated in the transverse direction , the ground - state exx problem has a simple explicit solution in terms of the ( spin- ) density @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a natural question arises whether the same route can be taken to build the analytical exx theory of many - body excitations in qldeg . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we give to this a positive answer by finding an explicit solution to the td exchange potential in terms of the td spin - density for qldeg with one band populated . </S>",
    "<S> for the solution to be expressible through the density , the applied perturbation must not change the symmetry of the qldeg , as is discussed below .    </S>",
    "<S> we start from the ground - state of a q2deg ( for 1d case , see below ) , uniform in the @xmath5-plane and confined in the @xmath6 direction by a potential @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the in - plane and the perpendicular variables separate in this case . </S>",
    "<S> we further assume that only the states @xmath8 and @xmath9 , one for each spin orientation , are occupied in the @xmath6-direction @xcite , leading to the electrons wave - functions of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the normalization area to this system we apply a td potential , which is assumed to depend on the @xmath6 coordinate only ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ syse ] ) and , by this , it preserves the system s lateral uniformity during the time - evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that a wealth of many - body phenomena are preserved within these constraints , while the gain is the system admitting an analytical solution .    </S>",
    "<S> the main result of this letter is that , with the above setup , the tdexx potential is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spin - density , @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the first - order modified struve and bessel functions @xcite , respectively , @xmath17 is the 2d spin - density , which does not change during the time - evolution , and @xmath18 is the corresponding 2d fermi radius . </S>",

    "<S> the fundamental quantities of tddft , such as the time - dependent exchange potential and the exchange kernel , have been constructed as an explicit nonlocal operator of the spin - density and purely analytically , respectively . </S>",
