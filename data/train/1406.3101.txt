    "perovskites abo@xmath13 bear many functionalities such as colossal magnetoresistance and multiferroicity , which usually arise from their fascinating electronic and magnetic properties and the cross - coupling effects .",
    "those properties , in a correlated electron system , often stem from an intriguing interplay among the charge , spin , and orbital degrees of freedom of the transition - metal ( tm ) cations and the lattice degree of freedom . besides the widely studied @xmath14 tm oxides , in recent years the @xmath15 and @xmath16 tm oxides also draw a lot of attention due to their significant spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effects  @xcite",
    ". then crystal field , electron correlation , soc , and band formation are all simultaneously present in such systems , and they would probably bring about novel electronic and magnetic properties  @xcite .    the double perovskites a@xmath0bbo@xmath1 ( b=@xmath14 tm , b=@xmath16 or @xmath15 tm ) could form a b - b ordered atomic structure ( interweaved fcc lattices ) due to the quite different charge states and ionic sizes of the @xmath14 , and @xmath16 or @xmath15 tm cations  @xcite . sr@xmath0femoo@xmath1 and sr@xmath0fereo@xmath1 are two representative examples , and they are classified as a ferrimagnetic ( fim ) half metal and display a giant tunneling magnetoresistance effect above room temperature  @xcite .",
    "half metals bear fully spin - polarized carriers and are an important kind of spintronic materials and have promising technological applications .",
    "therefore , double perovskites have been largely explored for their novel magnetic and electronic properties  @xcite .",
    "for example , sr@xmath0croso@xmath1 shows a fim order below @xmath17 725 k , which seems to be the highest @xmath18 record in the ( double ) perovskite oxides  @xcite .",
    "sr@xmath0feoso@xmath1 displays a lattice instability and competing spin structures  @xcite . in sr@xmath0cooso@xmath1 , the co and os sublattices exhibit different magnetic ground states and spin dynamics  @xcite .",
    "rotation and tilting of both the feo@xmath1 and oso@xmath1 octahedra cause bended fe - o - os bonds , being 152@xmath19 along the @xmath20 axis , and 152@xmath19 and 154@xmath19 in the @xmath21 plane  @xcite .",
    ", width=264 ]    in this work , using density functional calculations , we study the electronic structure and magnetism of the double perovskite ca@xmath0feoso@xmath1 , which was newly synthesized under a high- temperature and pressure  @xcite , see fig . 1 for its crystal structure .",
    "it was reported to be a high - temperature fim insulator with @xmath17 320 k  @xcite .",
    "as seen below , ca@xmath0feoso@xmath1 has the high - spin fe@xmath2-os@xmath4 charge state .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "2 a schematic level diagram and two possible exchange pathways , which lead to either an fm or an af coupling between the fe@xmath2 and os@xmath4 ions . for a @xmath22-@xmath23 system",
    ", one may expect a fm coupling , taking into account a local hund exchange and a @xmath24-@xmath24 charge fluctuation . in the present case ,",
    "however , a fm superexchange would require a virtual hopping of the fe@xmath2 @xmath12 electrons to the otherwise empty os@xmath4 @xmath12 states , see figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) .",
    "then the excited fe@xmath25-os@xmath25 intermediate state is involved , but an involvement of the high - level os @xmath12 crystal - field states could energetically disfavor this charge fluctuation process .",
    "on the other hand , when a more common fe@xmath26-os@xmath27 charge fluctuation state is considered , the down - spin os@xmath4 @xmath8 electrons would hop , forth and back , to the fe@xmath2 @xmath8 states , thus giving rise to an af coupling between fe@xmath2 and os@xmath4 , see figs .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) . as a result",
    ", there could be a competition between the fm and af couplings .",
    "moreover , for both the magnetic fe@xmath2 ( @xmath7 = 5/2 ) and os@xmath4 ( @xmath7 = 3/2 ) sublattices , there is in principle an af coupling in each fcc sublattice , and then spin frustration may also get involved .",
    "therefore , the magnetic ground state of ca@xmath0feoso@xmath1 and its spin - orbital physics are worth of a prompt study .",
    "and os@xmath4 . while the @xmath12 electron hopping would lead to an fm coupling , the @xmath8 electron hopping would result in an af coupling .",

    "we have used the full - potential augmented plane wave plus local orbital method coded in the wien2k package  @xcite .",
    "experimental lattice parameters are used  @xcite : ca@xmath0feoso@xmath1 is monoclinic ( @xmath28 = 90.021@xmath19 , the space group @xmath29 ) with the lattice constants @xmath30 = 5.393  , @xmath31 = 5.508  , and @xmath20 = 7.679  . owing to the rotation and tilting of the feo@xmath1 and oso@xmath1 octahedra , the fe - o - os bond angles range from 152 to 154@xmath19 , see fig .",
    "1 . in the following calculations ,",
    "we have used a local coordinate system with each axis being along the fe - o ( os - o ) bonds , in order to represent the fe @xmath14 and os @xmath15 orbital states in the local octahedral crystal field .",
    "muffin - tin sphere radii are chosen to be 2.8 , 2.2 , and 1.4 bohr for ca , fe / os , and o atoms .",
    "cutoff energy of 16 ryd is set for the interstitial plane wave expansion , and 6@xmath326@xmath324 k mesh for integration over the brillouin zone . for the exchange - correlation functional ,",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) is used ; and gga+@xmath33 calculations are also performed for including the static electron correlation  @xcite , with the hubbard @xmath33 = 5 ev ( 2 ev ) and hund @xmath34 = 0.9 ev ( 0.4 ev ) for fe @xmath14 ( os @xmath15 ) states . the soc is included by the second - variational method with scalar relativistic wave functions  @xcite . as seen below , however , in ca@xmath0feoso@xmath1 the fe@xmath2 ( @xmath35 ) and os@xmath4 ( @xmath36 ) cations have a large exchange splitting and closed subshells .",
    "therefore there is no orbital degree of freedom and the soc is ineffective .",

    "in order to see an intrinsic effect of the os @xmath15 electrons , we first carry out a spin - polarized gga calculation for the artificial ca@xmath0gaoso@xmath1 ( assuming the same structural parameters as ca@xmath0feoso@xmath1 ) to check a possible spin polarization of the os ion , and a spin - restricted gga+soc calculation to see how strong the soc is .",
    "we have replaced the magnetic fe@xmath2 by nonmagnetic ga@xmath2 , both of which have a similar ionic size ( 0.645  / fe@xmath2 @xmath39 0.620  / ga@xmath2 )  @xcite . as seen in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the os@xmath4 ion has a large @xmath8-@xmath12 crystal field splitting of more than 3 ev , which would make only the @xmath8 electrons active .",
    "the @xmath8 states have an exchange splitting of 1.3 ev , and they are fully spin - polarized , with the formal @xmath6 configuration ( @xmath7 = 3/2 ) . within its muffin - tin sphere , os@xmath4 ion has a reduced spin moment of 1.81 @xmath40 due to the delocalized behavior of the @xmath15 electrons and their strong covalency with the oxygen ligands ( a moderate electron correlation slightly enhances the spin moment to 1.88 @xmath40 in the gga+@xmath33 calculation for ca@xmath0gaoso@xmath1 ) . for the spin - restricted gga+soc calculation",
    ", we have used the soc basis set in a cubic crystal field , i.e. , the @xmath37 = 3/2 quartet and @xmath37 = 1/2 doublet  @xcite , to decompose the @xmath8 dos , see fig .",
    "however , we find a strong mixing between them , unlike the representative iridate sr@xmath0iro@xmath41 in which the @xmath37 = 3/2 and @xmath37 = 1/2 states are well split by the soc and they serve as a good basis set  @xcite .",
    "this difference can be attributed to the deviation from the cubic crystal field ( due to the rotation and tilting of the oso@xmath1 and feo@xmath1 octahedra in ca@xmath0feoso@xmath1  @xcite ) , and to the inter - site hopping of the delocalized os @xmath15 electrons in the fcc sublattice . the non - cubic crystal field and the band effect smear out the otherwise soc splitting of about 0.4 ev between the @xmath37 = 3/2 and @xmath37 = 1/2 states .",
    "apparently , in ca@xmath0feoso@xmath1 the os@xmath4 ion has a large intrinsic exchange splitting and has a closed @xmath6 subshell . owing to this and to the band formation , the soc is insignificant , which can also be seen in the following gga+@xmath33+soc calculation .",

    "the insulating gap is increased to 1.1 ev .",
    ", width=264 ]    now we probe the possible af coupling within both the fcc fe@xmath2 and os@xmath4 sublattices , whose values however can not be extracted from the energy differences of those magnetic states listed in table i. we calculate the fm state and the layered af state ( fm @xmath21 planes in an af stacking along the @xmath20 axis ) for both the artificial ca@xmath0gaoso@xmath1 and la@xmath0fegao@xmath1 ( both assuming the same structural parameters as ca@xmath0feoso@xmath1 , and moreover , 0.645  / fe@xmath2 , 0.575  / os@xmath4 , and 0.620  / ga@xmath2 all in a similar size  @xcite )",
    ". then @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be separately estimated .",
    "gga+@xmath33 calculations ( @xmath33 = 2 ev and hund @xmath34 = 0.4 ev for os @xmath15 states ) for ca@xmath0gaoso@xmath1 show that the layered af state is more stable than the fm state by 27 mev / fu ( equal to 8@xmath42 ) , which allows us to estimate the af @xmath42 to be about 3.5 mev . corresponding gga+@xmath33 calculations ( @xmath33 = 5 ev and hund @xmath34 = 0.9 ev for fe @xmath14 states ) for la@xmath0fegao@xmath1 show that the layered af state is more stable than the fm state by 20 mev / fu ( equal to 8@xmath43 ) .",
    "then the af @xmath43 is estimated to be 2.5 mev .",
    "compared with the delocalized os@xmath4 @xmath15 orbitals ( formal @xmath7 = 3/2 ) and probably stronger os - os magnetic coupling , the localized fe@xmath2 @xmath14 orbitals ( @xmath7 = 5/2 ) have a smaller exchange constant , but the larger spin = 5/2 compensates for the weaker exchange , giving rise to the comparable af coupling energy for each os - os pair and the fe - fe one ( 3.5 mev @xmath39 2.5 mev ) .    with @xmath44",
    "= 31 mev , @xmath42 = 3.5 mev , and @xmath43 = 2.5 mev , in ca@xmath0feoso@xmath1 the c - af state can also be estimated to be higher in energy than the g - af ground state by 4@xmath44  8@xmath42 ",
    "8@xmath43 = 76 mev / fu , and the a - af state is less stable than the g - af by 8@xmath44  8@xmath42  8@xmath43 = 200 mev / fu . besides 367 mev / fu energy difference between the fm and g - af states ( equal to 12@xmath44 )",
    ", the gga+@xmath33 calculated energy difference of 50 mev / fu between the c - af and g - af ( see table i ) , and that of 203 mev / fu between the a - af and g - af are both well comparable or close to the two estimated values of 76 and 200 mev / fu .",
    "this also justifies our choice of the artificial ca@xmath0gaoso@xmath1 and la@xmath0fegao@xmath1 to estimate the af @xmath42 and @xmath43 . as the nearest neighboring fe@xmath2-os@xmath4 af coupling energy ( more than 30 mev per pair ) is one order of magnitude larger than the next nearest neighboring os - os and fe - fe af coupling energy ( both with only few mev )",
    ", a possible magnetic frustration in both the fcc fe@xmath2 and os@xmath4 sublattices is actually suppressed , and then the collinear fim insulating state turns out to be the ground state .",
    "using a simple mean - field model , @xmath18 could be estimated to be @xmath45/(3@xmath46 ) = 2@xmath44/@xmath46 @xmath47 600 k , which would decrease upon a spin fluctuation and the possible spin frustration .",
    "this estimated @xmath18 and the calculated band gap of 1.1 ev for ca@xmath0feoso@xmath1 well account for the experimental above - room - temperature @xmath18 = 320 k and the insulating gap of 1.2 ev  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that in the present case , the soc is insignificant , as our gga+@xmath33+soc calculation for the fim ground state shows that the os@xmath4 has a spin moment of 1.64 @xmath40 ( compared with 1.73 @xmath40 by gga+@xmath33 ) but a small orbital moment of 0.13 @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , we explore a possibility to get a fm fe@xmath2-os@xmath4 coupling , which might be expected for a @xmath22-@xmath23 pair due to the @xmath12 hopping mechanism . in the test calculations , we stretch the @xmath20-axis fe - o - os bended bonds ( 152@xmath19 ) into straight ones by slightly enlarging the @xmath20-axis lattice constant ( from the experimental 7.68   @xcite to the artificial 7.92  ) and moving apical oxygens into the straight bonds ( for fixing the experimental fe - o - os bond distances ) .",
    "as the @xmath20-axis straight bonds would facilitate the @xmath12 hopping , a @xmath20-axis fm coupling could be promoted and then the c - af state could become most stable . indeed , our calculations show that with such structural changes , the c - af becomes the ground state and it is more stable than the g - af state by 31 mev / fu in gga and by 35 mev / fu in gga+@xmath33 .",
    "note , however , that a large elastic energy cost of about 1.2 ev / fu , associated with the structural changes , would actually prevent such phase occurring . then g - af ( fim ) is indeed the magnetic ground state for ca@xmath0feoso@xmath1 .",
    "in summary , we find , using density functional calculations , that the newly synthesized double perovskite ca@xmath0feoso@xmath1 is an fim insulator . it has the high - spin fe@xmath2-os@xmath4 charge state .",
    "the os@xmath4 ion has a large exchange splitting and has a closed @xmath6 subshell , and therefore the spin - orbit coupling is insignificant .",
    "the nearest neighboring fe@xmath2-os@xmath4 af coupling energy is more than 30 mev per pair , but the next nearest neighboring af coupling energy per os@xmath4-os@xmath4 pair and that per fe@xmath2-fe@xmath2 pair are both only few mev .",
    "thus , a possible magnetic frustration is suppressed in both the fcc os@xmath4 and fe@xmath2 sublattices , and ca@xmath0feoso@xmath1 displays a high-@xmath18 fim order .",
