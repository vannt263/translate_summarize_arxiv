    "the inflationary paradigm  @xcite is one of crucial pieces in cosmology , and recent developments in observational cosmology enabled us to study its features based on precision measurements .",
    "for instance , the planck collaboration reported that some of phenomenological inflationary models are excluded at high confidence levels  @xcite .",
    "however , there are still a lot of inflationary models that are consistent with current observations , and it is important to clarify observational features of those models to discriminate them .",
    "some inflationary models are based on plausible theories of high energy physics , such as the superstring theory and its low - energy effective theories .",
    "the string landscape scenario is one of important concepts to discuss nature of the inflationary vacua in this class of models . in this scenario ,",
    "quantum tunnelling is a key ingredient to create inflationary phase of our universe . such a quantum tunnelling results in a bubble nucleation@xcite during inflation , and it may cause a multi - stream inflation  @xcite whose signature would be observed in the cmb sky  @xcite .",
    "the membrane nucleation in the context of the axion monodromy inflation  @xcite may provide another realization of the multi - stream inflationary model .",
    "let us consider a bubble nucleation with a spherical domain wall during inflation .",
    "supposing that the regions inside and outside the domain wall are approximated by de sitter solutions with different values of the cosmological constant , we can apply the membrane nucleation process proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this process",
    ", the system is separated into two vacuum regions by a spherical domain wall at the moment of the bubble nucleation .",
    "the value of the cosmological constant corresponds to the potential height in each region , and the interior region has lower energy density compared to the exterior inflationary universe .",
    "the domain wall becomes super - horizon size soon after the nucleation , and after the inflation end it comes back to our horizon and starts to collapse due to its tension .",
    "in this paper , we analyze dynamics of such a domain wall shell just before and after it enters our horizon . here",
    ", we assume that the domain wall shell survives without decaying even after the inflation , and that there is no interaction other than the gravitational one between the shell and matter fields during the collapse .",
    "the collapsing domain wall will induce inhomogeneity to the background matter , and it would be an important observational feature of this system . in general , the spacetime and matter after the shell collapse will be disturbed not only by the gravitational interactions but also by the sound wave emitted from the shell , and it would be difficult to study their dynamics without resorting to numerical simulations . to circumvent this difficulty , as a first step , we concentrate on a matter - dominated era and treat the matter component as dust fluid , for which the sound speed vanishes .",
    "then , the spherically - symmetric inhomogeneous universe can be analytically described by the lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution .",
    "this assumption puts a restriction on the applicable scope of our analysis .",
    "since the bubble must enter the horizon during matter - dominated epoch , the domain wall size at the horizon crossing must be larger than 100 mpc comoving scale as long as we apply it to the late matter - dominated era .",
    "our analysis can be applied also to the matter - dominated era between the inflation end and the radiation - dominated era , if such an era exists , and the restriction on the domain wall size mentioned above could be avoided in this case .",
    "based on the discussions above , we study a spherical domain wall collapsing in a dust - dominated friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe .",
    "the spacetime region swept by the domain wall becomes inhomogeneous and is described by the ltb solution .",
    "the region outside the initial comoving radius of the domain wall is not influenced by the domain wall collapse and is described by the einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe . throughout this paper",
    ", we treat the domain wall as a thin shell with tension , that is , a shell with energy - momentum tensor equal to the induced metric multiplied by a constant coefficient . applying israel s junction conditions  @xcite to the shell",
    ", we obtain a set of ordinary differential equations to fix the shell trajectory and the inhomogeneity in the ltb region .",
    "we numerically solve these equations and figure out properties of the inhomogeneity .",
    "we also find that a black hole forms at the center of the system in the final stage of the collapse , and study its properties .",
