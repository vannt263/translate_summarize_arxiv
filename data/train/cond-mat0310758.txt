    "in this section we discuss experimental and theoretical issues about strain in manganite films .    in most cases",
    "tensile strain suppresses ferromagnetism and , consequently , critical temperature @xmath13 . on the contrary",
    ", compressive strain should reduce the resistivity and shifts @xmath13 toward higher temperatures with respect to the transition temperature of the bulk .",
    "the observed strain effect is usually interpreted within the double - exchange model , since the hopping matrix element @xmath20 can be altered by epitaxial strain through the change of the @xmath21 bond length @xmath22 and the bond angle @xmath12 .",
    "however , recent studies show that compressive strain does not always lead to enhancement of @xmath13 , @xcite and some anomalous results have been also reported for tensile strain .",
    "@xcite    in order to explain unusual results in manganite films , an extra mechanism mediated by the orbital state has been proposed .",
    "@xcite furthermore the theoretical work concerning manganite films has distinguished between uniform bulk strain and biaxial strain effects on the curie point .",
    "@xcite the biaxial strain increases the jahn - teller splitting and favors electron localization in @xmath10 levels , causing @xmath13 to decrease .",
    "the agreement with experimental data is in sign and order of magnitude pointing out that a jahn - teller coupling is a crucial variable .",
    "@xcite however , this model does not account for the observed decrease of @xmath13 upon thickness reduction mainly in films of @xmath19 on @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "@xcite    when the properties of epitaxial films are studied as a function of thickness , different and complex features are usually observed .",
    "first , a reduction of the curie point @xmath13 and the @xmath6 transition temperature @xmath27 of @xmath17 and @xmath19 films has been reported when thickness decreases .",
    "this occurs both for films with a gradually relaxed structure @xcite and for fully strained films @xcite showing that the strain can not be the only factor responsible for the reduction of @xmath13 in very thin films .",
    "second , when thickness is reduced , the resistivity increases and the magnetic moment often decreases .",
    "this has been usually interpreted as due to the presence of a dead layer located at interfaces .",
    "@xcite the thickness of these dead layers is of the order of a few @xmath28 depending on the substrate .",
    "the decrease of the curie temperature and the increase of resistivity are gradual suggesting that regions with higher resistivity could be present at distances from the interface larger than size of the dead layer .",
    "third , changes in the phase coexistence linked to the thickness dependence can lead to charge trapping in thin films .",
    "@xcite thus the thickness dependence and the strain effect are far from being fully understood and challenging .",
    "the adopted model takes into account the double - exchange mechanism , the coupling of the @xmath10 electrons to lattice distortions and the super - exchange interaction between neighboring localized @xmath9 electrons .",
    "@xcite within the single orbital approximation ( reasonable in the doping regime where @xmath5 occurs ) , the hamiltonian reads    @xmath29    the quantities in eq.([1r ] ) have been discussed in previous papers .",
    "@xcite in films the electron transfer element is assumed to be depending on the direction of hopping and open boundary conditions are imposed along the @xmath30 axis assumed as the out - of - plane axis of growth . as in the bulk , the dimensionless parameter @xmath31 is introduced to measure the strength of the @xmath14 interaction in the adiabatic regime .",
    "two canonical transformations are performed in order to treat the @xmath14 interaction variationally .",
    "then the bogoliubov inequality is employed in order to derive the variational free energy of the system using a test hamiltonian characterized by free electron , phonon and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite the electron free energy per site reads    @xmath32+\\mu \\rho , \\label{fro}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 is the temperature , @xmath34 the inverse of @xmath33 , @xmath35 the number of sites along the @xmath36 axis , and @xmath37 the electron density . in eq.([fro ] ) we have @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the renormalized electronic band .",
    "the band dispersion @xmath40 is @xmath41 -2 t_{eff}^z cos(k_z ) , \\label{11ur}\\ ] ] where the effective transfer integrals @xmath42 and @xmath43 take into account the polaronic and double - exchange effects , and the quantity @xmath44 measures the electronic band shift due to the @xmath14 interaction . due to the finite size along the @xmath30 axis ,",
    "the values of @xmath45 are given by @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "the thermodynamic limit is performed along @xmath48 and @xmath49 directions , using a constant electronic density of states @xmath50 , that represents a simple approximate expression for the exact density of states used for a @xmath51 lattice .    within the variational approach , in a way analogous to the bulk case , the linear response to an external electromagnetic field of frequency @xmath52 and , consequently",
    ", the transport properties in the limit @xmath53 can be calculated .",
    "@xcite the focus is on the real part of the conductivity tensor @xmath54 given by    @xmath55    where the @xmath56 is the retarded current - current correlation function .",
    "it can be deduced making the analytic continuation of the correlation function defined in matsubara frequencies as @xmath57 where the current operator @xmath58 suitable for the film geometry is    @xmath59    with @xmath60 electron charge .",
    "we perform the two canonical transformations and make the decoupling of the correlation function in electron , phonon and spin terms through the introduction of the test mean - field hamiltonian . in manganite films",

    "@xcite the effect of the damping can enter the calculation substituting @xmath67 for @xmath68 that in matsubara frequencies is expressed as @xmath69 where the spectral function @xmath70 is assumed to be    @xmath71 ^ 2/4 + ( \\omega - \\xi_{{\\bf k } } ) ^2    } , \\label{43r}\\ ] ]    with @xmath72 rate of the scattering with optical phonons and spin fluctuations evaluated on the energy shell .",
    "@xcite    the conductivity tensor @xmath54 is deduced following the lines of our previous works .",
    "@xcite in the film geometry this tensor is diagonal with @xmath73 , thus , in the limit @xmath53 ,",
    "two different resistivities are obtained : in - plane resistivity @xmath74 and out - of - plane resistivity @xmath75 .",
    "in this section we analyze the effects of the thickness on the phase diagram , the magnetization and the transport properties of the film . for the moment we do not introduce hopping anisotropies being @xmath76 , with @xmath77 .",
    "first the role of the size is investigated in the regime of weak @xmath14 coupling appropriate for @xmath17 films . in fig .",
    "1 the phase diagram of the film is reported for the bulk ( solid line ) , for a film made of 10 planes ( dashed line ) and 5 planes ( dotted line ) . for these values of the parameters the system exhibits a continuous transition from a double - exchange ferromagnet to a metallic paramagnet .",
    "a decrease of size leads to a reduction of the ferromagnetic phase that seems to be a generic feature of magnetic films .",
    "@xcite actually the critical temperature shifts to lower temperatures than that of the bulk when the spin - spin correlation exceeds the film thickness .",
    "@xcite in the inset of fig.1 the variation of the curie temperature as function of the number of the planes is reported .",
    "the critical temperature shows a large decrease as the number of planes is reduced .",
    "this effect is very pronounced when the number of planes is smaller than @xmath78 : in fact in this case there is a shift of the critical temperature larger than @xmath79 of the corresponding temperature of the bulk .",
    "we have investigated the thickness dependence also for a manganite film in the regime of intermediate @xmath14 coupling and bandwidth suitable for @xmath19 films . in this case near the @xmath6 transition the system segregates in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic or paramagnetic domains of itinerant and localized carriers , respectively .",
    "@xcite in fig .",
    "2 the phase diagram for these systems is shown in correspondence with different sizes of the system . we find that the reduction of the ferromagnetism does not depend on the order of the transition .",
    "although the transition lines are different from the phase diagram of the film in the weak - coupling regime , the decrease of the ferromagnetic phase is of the same order .",
    "this is confirmed also by the behavior of the critical temperature as a function of the number of planes , as reported in the inset of fig .",
    "even if the transition temperatures are lower , the shape of the curve bears a strong similarity with the corresponding plot for systems in weak - coupling regime : in both cases the shift of curie temperature @xmath80 follows a power law @xmath81 .",
    "@xcite    we note that , in manganite films grown without detectable lattice defects , the decrease of the critical temperature occurs for a thickness smaller than @xmath82 .",
    "@xcite therefore for thin films characterized by thickness larger than the possible dead layer , the size effect can be relevant in the interpretation of experimental behaviors allowing to explain the gradual decrease of the critical temperature with decreasing film size .",
    "actually , the tendency towards the localization in the thinnest films can not be entirely ascribed to the presence of a dead layer .",
    "due to the thickness effect , the ground state presents a weaker order of spins , that can be easier destroyed with increasing temperature . indeed , as the size of the film is reduced , the magnetization assumes smaller values at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite in a double - exchange model a weakening of the ferromagnetism is expected to reduce the mobility of the carriers .",
    "this is confirmed by the calculated in - plane resistivity @xmath74 that , as reported in fig .",
    "3 , at @xmath83 , exhibits a significant increase as the number of planes decreases ( the out - of - plane resistivity @xmath75 shows a similar behavior ) . like the critical temperature ,",
    "large variations occur when the film is very thin suggesting that size effect can be important to explain the gradual increase of the resistivity as the thickness decreases . however , the behavior of resistivity with respect to the number of planes is different as the temperature increases .",
    "in fact , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "4 , at higher temperatures the resistivity of the film is smaller for thinner films .",
    "this can be understood considering that the differences in the spin order due to size effects diminish with increasing temperature .",
    "so the bare behavior of the scattering rate with optical phonons emerges : this type of scattering decreases when the size of the system is reduced in agreement with what happens in quantum wells .",
    "@xcite at high temperatures , in addition to size effect , other effects such as the strain have to be considered in order to get a better agreement with experimental data .",
    "in this section we deal with strain effects on the properties of the film .",
    "the strain in the film is introduced through the modifications of in - plane and out - of - plane hoppings , that are linked to lattice parameters measured in these systems .",
    "it can be assumed @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the in - plane bond length and @xmath86 , with @xmath87 in - plane bond angle .",
    "@xcite in an analogous manner , we can have @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the out - of - plane bond length and @xmath90 , with @xmath91 out - of - plane bond angle .",
    "if one neglects the angular dependence , the ratio of the hopping amplitudes of the film with respect to the bulk values are given by @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the lattice parameter of bulk , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are in - plane and out - of - plane lattice parameters of the film measured by x - ray diffraction experiments .",
    "@xcite these ratios simulate the strain of the film within the variational approach , so its effects on the phase diagram and the transport properties can be estimated .",
    "the variations of the phase diagram are controlled mainly by the changes of in - plane hopping , so that compressive strain ( @xmath97 ) leads to an enhancement of the critical temperature , while tensile strain ( @xmath98 ) to a reduction .",
    "the increase of the compressive ( tensile ) strain is able to perturb the system also at low temperatures where the ferromagnetic alignment of the spins is reinforced ( reduced ) . deriving in - plane and out - of - plane hoppings from the lattice parameters of a compressively strained @xmath17 film,@xcite it is found that the strain introduces anisotropies in the transport properties of the films in the weak coupling regime .",
    "@xcite indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the in - plane resistivity @xmath74 decreases in temperature with increasing compressive strain , while the out - of - plane resistivity @xmath75 increases .",
    "this is explained by the fact that , increasing the strain , the in - plane hopping is enhanced , while the out - of - plane hopping is reduced . in any case , at low temperatures , due to the enhancement of the ferromagnetic order induced by the compressive strain , both the resistivities decrease with increasing strain .",
    "next we have investigated the effects of compressive and tensile strain on the phase diagram of a manganite film in the intermediate coupling regime .",
    "the in - plane and out - of - plane hopping amplitudes have been deduced considering the lattice parameters of @xmath19 films grown on different substrates .",
    "@xcite the film on @xmath26 corresponds to the ratio @xmath99 , that on @xmath100 to @xmath101 , finally that grown on @xmath24 to @xmath102 . as shown in fig . 5 , in the first case , the compressive strain ( dotted line with diamonds ) leads to an enhancement of the critical temperature with respect to the bulk value ( solid line with circles ) unlike experimental results .",
    "@xcite in the second case , even if field strain is near the unity ( dash - dotted line with down triangles ) , the critical temperature shifts at lower temperatures in agreement with experimental data .",
    "actually in this case both the lattice parameters exceed the bulk value , determining a reduction of the in - plane hopping . in the third case , for tensile strain (",
    "dashed line with squares ) , the shift of the curie temperature in comparison with the bulk value is consistent with experimental measurements .",
    "@xcite    we stress that the results discussed above have been obtained neglecting the dependence of hopping amplitudes on the @xmath1 bond angle @xmath12 .",
    "however , in bulks of @xmath0 perovskites , it has been shown that changes in @xmath2 site ionic size affect only @xmath12 , while the bond length @xmath22 seems to be unchanged ( @xmath103 ) suggesting as a maximum lattice parameter @xmath104 .",
    "@xcite recent measurements in @xmath19 thin films on @xmath26 and @xmath24 substrates @xcite have showed that @xmath85 is fixed to a value that does not depend on the type of strain , while the in - plane bond angle is changed .",
    "the angle @xmath87 becomes larger ( smaller ) under tensile ( compressive ) strain , showing consistency with the elongation ( contraction ) of @xmath95 .",
    "similar results have been observed also in @xmath17 films on @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite hence , it is reasonable to assume that values of the lattice parameter larger than those of the bulk imply stretching of @xmath22 ( @xmath12 near @xmath105 ) and smaller lattice parameters induce a contraction of @xmath12 ( @xmath22 near @xmath106 ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath19 films grown on @xmath26 the angular dependence is not negligible . @xcite actually , deriving @xmath87 from experimental data @xcite ( @xmath107 ) and considering only the changes of in - plane parameters ( that are the most important ) , we can deduce the variation of the in - plane hopping from the knowledge of the @xmath1 angle of the bulk @xcite ( @xmath108 ) . as reported in fig .",
    "5 ( dash - dotted line with up triangles ) , even if the strain is compressive , the critical temperature is reduced compared with bulk value in agreement with experimental data .",
    "in this section we focus our attention on the variations of the @xmath14 coupling linked to the presence of strain that can be included in order to improve the description of manganite films .",
    "both uniform bulk strain and biaxial strain can affect the @xmath14 coupling strength of the carriers in manganite films .",
    "@xcite while the biaxial distortions tend to increase the localization of the carriers , the bulk strain can lead to an increase or a decrease of @xmath14 coupling depending on the sign of the strain .",
    "actually , a uniform compression tends to increase the electron hopping amplitudes reducing the importance of the @xmath14 coupling .",
    "so , unlike tensile strain , for compressive strain two opposite behaviors influence the variations of the @xmath14 coupling . in any case , for very thin films , the tendency towards localization can be simulated in our scheme by an enhancement of the @xmath14 coupling .    for @xmath17 films grown on @xmath24 the size and strain dependence of the transition temperature",
    "is strongly influenced by the strain - induced @xmath14 coupling .",
    "@xcite actually we have verified that a small reduction ( increase ) in @xmath14 coupling can induce a large enhancement ( decrease ) of the critical temperature in the @xmath5 regime .",
    "for fully strained @xmath19 films grown on different substrates the delicate balance of segregating phases is strongly influenced by finite size and strain effects .",
    "deducing sizes and strain fields of the @xmath19 films grown on @xmath24 , @xcite in fig .",
    "6 we show the corresponding phase diagrams calculated supposing a likely distribution of the quantity @xmath109 , that represents the ratio between the @xmath14 coupling @xmath110 of the film and that of the thickest film . the concomitant effects induce a strong lowering of the transition temperature and at low @xmath33 an increase in the weight of antiferromagnetic insulating phases . in fact , for a film characterized by a thickness of @xmath111 planes and a ratio @xmath112 , an antiferromagnetic insulating phase of localized charges is stabilized at low temperatures in agreement with experiment .",
    "@xcite therefore , the insulating dead layer could originate as natural consequence of reduced size of the film , strain effect and increased @xmath14 coupling . in fig .",
    "7 the magnetization ( upper panel ) and the in - plane resistivity ( lower panel ) are reported as function of the temperature for three different values of the strain and @xmath14 coupling . as result of the competition between ferromagnetic metallic and antiferromagnetic or paramagnetic insulating phases , @xcite the magnetization",
    "is strongly reduced , while the resistivity is largely enhanced showing consistency with experiments @xcite .",
    "finally we stress that the nearly constant behavior of the resistivity at intermediate temperatures is characteristic of the antiferromagnetic phase of localized carriers . only at higher temperatures , in the paramagnetic phase",
    ", the resistivity strongly diminishes with increasing temperature .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the thickness dependence and strain effects in films of @xmath0 perovskites within the @xmath5 regime .",
    "a variational approach previously proposed for manganite bulk has been generalized in order to consider the film geometry .",
    "a reduction in the thickness of the film causes a decrease of the transition temperature and the magnetization , and increase of the resistivity especially at low temperatures .",
    "if the film is very thin but has thickness larger than the possible dead layer , the calculated results show good agreement with experimental behaviors .",
    "the strain is associated with the changes of in - plane and out - of - plane electron hopping amplitudes induced by the substrate .",
    "the variations of the phase diagram with respect to the bulk are controlled mainly by the changes of in - plane hopping , so that the compressive strain leads to an enhancement of the critical temperature , while tensile strain weakens the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "if the dependence of the hopping matrix elements on the @xmath1 bond angle is properly considered , the strain effects on the transition temperature and transport properties are consistent with experimental data .",
    "finally it is shown that substrate - induced variations of the @xmath14 coupling , together with finite size and strain effects , can strongly influence the subtle balance of coexisting phases favoring insulating phases when the thickness of the film decreases .",
    "although the results presented in this paper are quite satisfactory , we wish to mention other mechanisms that could influence the thermodynamic and transport properties , at least qualitatively . first a strain - induced modification of @xmath10 electron orbital stability can affect the phase diagram of the system .",
    "@xcite changes in oxygen content resulting in cationic vacancies due to the annealing may shift the critical temperature at values much higher than any bulk values in the series compounds .",
    "@xcite the loss of magnetic moment and the increase of resistivity could be caused by the domain - type disorder . @xcite",
    "even if in manganite films spatial inhomogeneities can be intrinsic , @xcite the disorder induced by the substrate could be responsible also for phase separation .",
    "@xcite    as stressed in the previous section , the tendencies toward phase separation can be important to explain the presence of the insulating dead layer in manganite films .",
    "the variational approach used in this paper can be further generalized to consider insulating planes separated through an interface from metallic planes .",
    "strain effects and thickness dependence could strongly perturb the size of insulating and metallic planes giving rise to the dead layer .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",

    "<S> the thickness dependence has been studied finding similar results in the weak @xmath14 coupling regime appropriate for large bandwidth systems such as @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) films and in the intermediate regime suitable for @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) films : reduction of the critical temperature , decrease of the magnetization and increase of the resistivity especially at low temperatures . for thin films characterized by a thickness larger than the possible dead layer , </S>",
    "<S> the calculated results are in good agreement with experimental behaviors .    </S>",
    "<S> the strain in the film is simulated through modifications of in - plane and out - of - plane hoppings , that are related to lattice parameters measured in these systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the compressive strain leads to an enhancement of the critical temperature , while tensile strain weakens the ferromagnetic phase . when the dependence on the bond angle @xmath12 is properly taken into account , </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that also for compressive strain a reduction of the transition temperature can occur . </S>",
    "<S> the strain introduces also anisotropies in the transport properties showing the consistency of the theory with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> finally substrate - induced variations of the @xmath14 coupling are considered pointing out that , together with finite size and strain effects , they can strongly influence the subtle balance of coexisting phases favoring insulating phases when the thickness of the film decreases .    in section i experimental and theoretical issues about strain in manganite films </S>",
    "<S> are discussed ; in section ii the variational approach and the transport properties of the bulk are generalized to deal with manganite films ; in section iii the thickness dependence is analyzed ; in section iv the strain effects on the phase diagram and transport properties are calculated ; in section v changes of the @xmath14 coupling induced by the substrate are considered . </S>"
