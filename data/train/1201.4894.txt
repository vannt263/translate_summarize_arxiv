    "quantum computation and information theory are research areas which have developed amazingly fast .",
    "this rapid and accelerated development is due to the promises of qualitatively new modes of computation and communication based on quantum technologies , that in some cases are much more powerful than their classical counterparts , and also due to the impact that these new technologies can provide to society .",
    "advances occur in different directions and the theoretical proposals as well as the experimental achievements involves fundamental concepts that live at the heart of quantum mechanics .",
    "one of the most remarkable examples is the measurement - based quantum computation @xcite .",
    "while the standard quantum computation is based on sequences of unitary quantum logic gates , the measurement - based quantum computation is realized using only local conditioned projective measurements applied to a highly entangled state called the cluster state . as it is entirely based on local measurements instead of unitary evolution ,",
    "the computation is inherently irreversible in time .",
    "recently , this one - way quantum computation has attracted a lot of attention of the scientific community @xcite and has been studied considering : ( i ) various important aspects which might influence it , such as decoherence during the computation @xcite and ( ii ) novel schemes of implementation @xcite .",
    "in addition , since the technical requirements for the latter can be much simpler than those for the standard circuit model , it has been realized in several experiments @xcite .    the noise process , that emerges from the inevitable interaction of the qubits with their environment , remains one of the major problems to be overcome before we shall be able to manufacture a functional quantum computer .",
    "the interaction of the qubits with the environment , which depends on the quantum computer architecture , is a crucial problem that is far from being well understood .",
    "however , it is known that this interaction can result in non - monotonical dynamics of the density matrix coherences @xcite and a complete understanding of this behavior is a matter of great importance . moreover , this non - monotonical behavior , is a subject of broad interest @xcite , since this peculiar property brings up unexpected dynamics for quantum fidelity @xcite as well as for quantum entanglement @xcite and quantum discord @xcite .",
    "when an open quantum system interacts with the outside world there are two main effects that have to be considered : the relaxation and the decoherence processes .",
    "the relaxation process is associated with an expected loss of energy of the initial state of the system which happens at the rate @xmath1 , where the time scale @xmath2 is known as the relaxation time scale of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "the decoherence process is associated with the reduction of purity of this physical state and takes place within a time scale @xmath3 .",
    "depending on the physical system one considers , the time scale @xmath3 can be much shorter than @xmath2 , making quantum computers more sensitive to decoherence than to relaxation process .",
    "this is exactly the situation we are going to address in this paper .",
    "based on the foregoing reasoning , we use an exact solvable model @xcite to calculate the dissipative fidelity dynamics in a linear measurement - based quantum computer ( mbqc ) @xcite composed by few qubits which interact collectively with a dephasing environment .",
    "although this kind of model does not describe relaxation processes , it does indeed adequately describe decoherence effects .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the total azimuthal angular momentum in a system of @xmath0 qubits , and @xmath6 is the operator that acts only on the environmental degrees of freedom . we show that for any initial state given by an eigenstate superposition of the @xmath7 operator , whose eigenvalues are different in modulus , the fidelity exhibits a non - monotonical character . to be more precise , suppose we have a system whose initial state can be written in a suitable basis as @xmath8 where @xmath9 , with @xmath10 ; if the vectors that characterize the state @xmath11 are such that their @xmath7 eigenvalues are all equal in modulus , i.e. , if their @xmath12 s are all equal , the fidelity dynamics does not exhibit a non - monotonical shape , but if at least one vector that composes the state @xmath11 has a @xmath12 different from the other vectors we can observe a non - monotonical behavior of the fidelity dynamics .",
    "this condition reveals itself to be necessary for the fidelity to present an oscillatory shape , and , remarkably , it does not depend on the initial entanglement ( depending only on the initial configuration of the state of the system ) .",
    "furthermore , we study the implications of this oscillatory behavior to the mbqc where a sequence of local projective measurements are applied on the qubits to implement a quantum gate . as we shall see , we can take advantage of the revival times of the coherence of the cluster state to apply the projective measurements at times such that we get the best gate fidelity values .",
    "therefore , we can choose the best possible instants that produce the best possible results . in this sense , fast measurements can result worse than slow , but conveniently applied measurements .",
    "that is , under the action of a common dephasing environment , the mbqc can provide better computational fidelities even for slow measurement sequences .",
    "this result , as we will see bellow , is a natural consequence of the oscillatory behavior of the density - matrix coherences . to illustrate our finding we examine the fidelity of some single qubit quantum gates that are frequently found in the literature @xcite developed using the mbqc scheme .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the exact dissipative dynamics of the @xmath0-qubit system interacting with a common dephasing environment @xcite . in section",
    "iii we show the necessary condition for the non - monotonical behavior of the fidelity to take place and , in section iv , we present the implications of our results to the mbqc .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "consider the following hamiltonian of a system composed of @xmath0 qubits interacting with a common dephasing environment : @xmath13 where the first two terms account for the free evolution of the qubits and the environment , and the third term describes the interaction between them .",
    "the environment operators , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are the customary creation and annihilation operators which follow the heisenberg s algebra @xmath16 = \\delta_{k , k'}$ ] .",
    "the qubit operator @xmath17 is the pauli @xmath18 operator of the @xmath19-th qubit .",
    "the complex constant @xmath20 has dimension of frequency and indicates the coupling between the qubits and the field modes .",
    "in addition , @xmath21 is the difference of energy between the ground and excited levels of the @xmath19-th qubit and @xmath22 is the energy associated with the @xmath23-th mode of the field , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 being , respectively , the transition frequency and the field frequency of the @xmath23-th mode .",
    "we assume that initially the state of the qubits and the state of the environment are decoupled , i.e. , the total initial state of the system and the environment ( which we call the combined system from now on ) can be represented by a density operator given by the following tensor product @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 stand for the initial state of the qubits and the initial state of the environment , respectively .",

    "there are additional terms oscillating with frequency @xmath67 in the off - diagonal elements of that operator .",
    "in our model we assume an ohmic spectral density , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a dimensionless proportionality constant that characterizes the coupling strength between the system and the environment . substituting eq .",
    "( [ edd.17a ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ edd.16 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ edd.17 ] ) we obtain @xmath70 and @xmath71 the result of the integration in eq .",
    "( [ edd.17b ] ) is also well - known @xcite and reads : @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "it is easy to note , from eqs .",
    "( [ edd.15 ] ) and ( [ edd.17d ] ) , that the decoherence effects arising from thermal noise can be separated from those due to the vacuum fluctuations .",
    "this separation allows for an exam of different time scales present in the dynamics .",
    "the shortest time scale is determined by the cutoff frequency ( see eq .",
    "( [ edd.17c ] ) above ) , @xmath74 .",
    "the other natural time scale , @xmath75 , is determined by the thermal frequency @xmath76 ( see eq .",
    "( [ edd.17d ] ) above ) which is related to the relaxation of the off - diagonal elements of the density operator .",
    "with these two time scales we can define two different regimes of time @xcite : the _ thermal _ regime and the _ quantum _ regime .",
    "thermal effects will affect the @xmath0-qubit system predominantly only for times @xmath77 whereas the quantum regime dominates over any time interval @xmath78 such that @xmath79 , when the quantum vacuum fluctuations contribute predominantly .",
    "besides , we can see from eqs . ( [ edd.17c ] ) and ( [ edd.17d ] ) that for a sufficiently high - temperature environment , i.e. , @xmath80 , the phase damping factor , which is the main agent responsible for the decoherence , behaves as @xmath81 causing an exponential decay of the off - diagonal elements of the density operator .",
    "moreover , as the phase factor @xmath82 implies an oscillation with frequency @xmath83 , this time evolution is always slightly underdamped .",
    "notice that one should never reach the overdamped regime since as @xmath84 is the shortest time scale in the problem it does not make any sense to make @xmath85 .    in the low temperature limit ,",
    "when @xmath86 , the relaxation factor behaves as @xmath87 which leads the off - diagonal matrix elements to an algebraic decay of the form @xmath88 . in this case",
    ", what we have called above the thermal regime is only reached for very long times , @xmath89 .",
    "as we will show below , the quantum regime implies a very different dynamics of the fidelity and shows up peculiar results to the mbqc , where delayed measurements can result in better computation fidelities .",
    "in this section we are interested to know when the fidelity dynamics of an @xmath0-qubit system , interacting collectively with a dephasing environment , will oscillate in time .",
    "we introduce , for the quantum regime , a necessary condition for the non - monotonical behavior to be present . here , since we always consider a pure state as our initial condition , the fidelity as a function of time , in the interaction picture , is given by @xmath90    the dynamics of qubits interacting with a common environment is strongly dependent upon the initial condition , and we will show that , for the quantum regime , the fidelity will always present a non - monotonical behavior when the @xmath0-qubit system is written as a coherent superposition of @xmath7 eigenstates whose eigenvalues are different in modulus . as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ edd.15 ] ) , the second exponential term is responsible for the oscillations and it is identical to the unity when @xmath91 , i.e. , when @xmath92 . note that @xmath93 are the eigenvalues of the total pauli operator associated with the eigenstates @xmath94 .",
    "thus , if the initial state of the @xmath0-qubit system is a coherent superposition of eigenstates of the @xmath7 operator , whose eigenvalues are equal in modulus , the condition @xmath92 is automatically satisfied and the fidelity dynamics does not oscillate at all . on the other hand , a state of @xmath0 qubits that is not written in this way , i.e. , a state that is written as a coherent superposition of the @xmath7 eigenstates whose eigenvalues are not all equal in modulus ( e.g. , if exist at least one eigenvalue different from the others in modulus ) , has a fidelity which indeed oscillates in time . consequently , in the quantum regime , the condition @xmath95 is a necessary condition for the non - monotonical behavior of the fidelity to take place .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this behavior is intrinsic to the geometry of the initial condition , that is , it depends only on the basis vectors spanning the initial state , and this property is not correlated with the initial entanglement .",
    "a simple example is the two - qubit state given by @xmath96 although disentangled , the state is written as a coherent superposition of eigenstates of the @xmath7 operator whose eigenvalues have different moduli and , therefore , its fidelity oscillates in time following the equation below @xmath97 .",

    "from now on we will be concerned with the mbqc fidelity dynamics where the cluster states are subject to a dephasing channel .",
    "we will show how our previous result brings crucial consequences to the computational outcomes we can obtain , depending on the moment we decide to apply our set of projective measurements . to elucidate these aspects we analyze some common single qubit gates @xcite under the mbqc scheme @xcite . following reference @xcite ,",
    "an arbitrary rotation can be achieved in a chain of five disentangled qubits , @xmath98 where the qubits 2 to 5 are initially prepared in the state @xmath99 while the qubit 1 is prepared in some input state which is to be rotated .",

    "an arbitrary rotation usually requires three angles in the euler representation , the euler angles , and it can be seen as a composition of three other rotations of the form : @xmath109 , where @xmath110 . in the mbqc scheme , the qubits @xmath111",

    "primarily , let us consider the first scenario where the measurements that characterize the specific one qubit gate are performed at different times and the state evolves non - unitarilly between measurements .    to begin with , we consider a not gate acting on an input state given by @xmath159 .",

    "once again , taking into account the interaction of our  quantum computer \" with the dephasing environment , and applying the projectors at @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , we obtain a gate fidelity of @xmath200 while if we wait to apply the projectors at @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 we get a gate fidelity of @xmath201 .",

    "we start with the not gate fidelity dynamics and in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show this gate fidelity for @xmath127 and @xmath210 as a function of time in the quantum regime . as in our previous examples",
    ", we observe that there are times that maximize the value of the gate fidelity and times that minimize it .",
    "it is clear that if all measurements are performed at @xmath211 the computation fidelity is @xmath212 , but if there is a gap between the first and the three subsequent measurements , then there is an optimum value of the time gap . in the example illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , if @xmath157 is greater than @xmath213 ( where the gate fidelity is @xmath214 ) the best gate fidelity is obtained for @xmath215 , when it reaches @xmath214 again .",
    "if we apply the same gate operation at later times like @xmath216 or @xmath217 , we still get a gate fidelity better than @xmath218 . however ,",
    "if we apply this operation at @xmath219 we obtain a gate fidelity of @xmath220 , showing that fast measurements is not a warranty of good mbqc results .",
    "when the three subsequent measurements are performed almost simultaneously .",
    "we consider @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 . ]",
    "considering a hadamard gate fidelity dynamics , we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that a input state @xmath159 is rotated to the output state @xmath221 with probability greater than @xmath218 at times like @xmath215 , @xmath216 or @xmath217 while it is rotated to the same output state with probability of less than @xmath222 at times like @xmath223 , @xmath224 or @xmath225 .     when the three subsequent measurements are performed almost simultaneously .",
    "we choose the state @xmath226 to be rotated to @xmath227 .",
    "we consider @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 . ]",
    "[ h ]   for the quantum regime .",
    "we choose the state @xmath228 to be rotated to @xmath229 .",
    "we consider @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we can see the phase gate fidelity dynamics and observe once again that the oscillatory behavior presented by the cluster state interacting with the specific kind of quantum channel considered in this paper produces instants of time that optimize the value of the computation compared with times that do exact the opposite . again we see that at times like @xmath230 , @xmath231 or @xmath232 we have a gate fidelity of @xmath233 , @xmath202 and @xmath214 , respectively , while at times such as @xmath234 , @xmath235 or @xmath236 we have a gate fidelity of @xmath237 , @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that ultra fast measurements , which have to be performed in the very short bath correlation time scale , can be produced with current technology @xcite .",
    "these are the basis of the dynamical decoupling techniques that are applied to beat the decoherence process @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even in this very short time scale , the time that each measurement is applied can be very precise , as we can see , for example , in the experimental realization of the uhrig dynamical decoupling , the carr - purcell - meiboom - gill - style multi - pulse spin echo @xcite , and others .",
    "this implies that the scenario studied in the manuscript is very realistic and that any mbqc realized with ultra fast measurements needs to account for the oscillatory behavior of the dynamics .",
    "we study the exact dynamics of an @xmath0-qubit system interacting with a common dephasing environment and we introduce a necessary condition for the system fidelity to present a non - monotonical behavior .",
    "our approach reveals that this characteristic does not depend on the initial quantum entanglement and , in fact , is a property connected with the geometry of the state .",
    "actually , for any initial state given by a superposition of eigenstates of the total pauli @xmath7 operator , the fidelity exhibits a non - monotonical character if at least one of the eigenvalues of the components differs from the others .",
    "we show that this behavior of the fidelity brings crucial implications to the mbqc , that is , we show that , under the action of a common dephasing environment , this non - monotonical time dependence can provide us with appropriate time intervals for the preservation of better computational fidelities .",
    "we have illustrated our findings by examining the fidelity of a not , a hadamard and a phase quantum gates realized via mbqc .",
