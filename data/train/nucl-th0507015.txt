    "the bose - einstein induced correlation of particles produced in high - energy @xmath0 reactions was first observed by goldhaber , goldhaber , lee and pais  @xcite in 1960 .",
    "the connection of this effect to hanbury - brown / twiss intensity interferometry followed several years later @xcite . since then , two particle interferometry has become a powerful tool to study heavy - ion reactions : it is used at all available energies from msu - nscl @xcite to rhic @xcite and the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the variety of particles used in these studies include protons , neutrons , mesons , intermediate mass fragments , electrons , photons , and even exotic hadrons such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 s . in all cases ,",
    "our goal is to understand the space - time development of nuclear reactions .",
    "one particularly fruitful class of this observable is multidimensional pion correlations .",
    "two pion correlations have been used to demonstrate the hydrodynamical scaling of the source radii @xcite , to determine the average freeze - out phase - space density @xcite and to characterize the final state of heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "we would like to extend this success to other particles , such as protons or kaons , where simple coulomb corrections may be ( or are ) insufficient to study the data .",
    "indeed , final - state interactions ( fsi ) are essential ingredients @xcite for multidimensional measurements of non - identical correlations . for this , we extend the one dimensional source imaging technique of @xcite to these multidimensional correlations .",
    "source imaging allows us to cleanly separate effects due to fsi and symmetrization from effects due to the source function itself .",
    "because no assumptions are made about the functional form of the source function , the imaging is model independent .",
    "this means that it is possible to image non - gaussian sources @xcite .",
    "furthermore , imaging allows us to directly compare full three - dimensional proton and pion sources , free from the distortions due to fsi .",
    "imaging is a useful alternate approach to the standard analysis which involves first applying a coulomb correction then fitting the corrected data to a gaussian .",
    "we can extract the source _ without _ an ad - hoc coulomb correction , and later if we wish , fit the extracted source to a gaussian .",
    "while this technique may be applied to other pair types , e.g. proton - proton pairs @xcite , we will concentrate on like meson pairs .    extracting the source function , @xmath3 , for a pair of identical particles begins by noting that the koonin - pratt equation relates it to the experimentally measured two - particle correlation , @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 , its deviation from 1 ) @xcite : @xmath6",
    "thus , `` imaging the source '' means inverting this equation . in , @xmath7 is the total momentum of the pair and the kernel of the integral equation is @xmath8 the wavefunction , @xmath9 , describes the propagation of the pair from a relative separation of @xmath10 in the pair center of mass ( cm ) to the detector with relative momentum @xmath11 . here",
    "primes denote quantities in the pair cm frame .",
    "the source function itself is the probability of emitting the pair a distance of @xmath10 apart in the pair cm frame .    the problem of inverting eq .",
    "is generally ill - posed , meaning that small fluctuations in the data , even if well within statistical or systematic errors , can lead to large changes in the imaged source function . in angle - averaged correlations ,",
    "this stability problem is solved by the use of constraints , a basis spline representation of the source , and `` optimized discretization '' @xcite . by expanding the source and the correlation in spherical harmonics",
    ", we may convert the full three - dimensional problem into a series of one - dimensional problems where these tools are equally applicable . throughout this process",
    ", we must take care to respect the frame dependence of the source function . in an angle - averaged like - pair correlation",
    ", one may work in terms of @xmath12 , so the analysis frame is not an issue .",
    "in full three - dimensional analysis , we must properly carry out the transformation from the frame where the data is compiled to the frame where we image .",
    "we now outline this paper .",
    "first , we will set up the problem , taking into account the special issues in a full three - dimensional analysis .",
    "this includes a discussion of how the source function and underlying emission functions are related , the frame dependence of the imaging , the coordinate system used in the imaging and a non - trivial test case .",
    "next , we describe the three - dimensional imaging procedure .",
    "this process amounts to breaking the problem into a series of one - dimensional problems .",
    "we describe this procedure and its implications , especially to the source and its representation .",
    "we illustrate the entire imaging process using the non - trivial test case .",
    "in this section , we detail the connection between the correlation and source functions and the underlying emission functions . in this process , we illuminate some of the technical issues arising from the frame dependence of the source function .",
    "we also define the coordinates that we use in our analyses . following this",
    ", we detail the non - trivial model correlation we use as a test case to illustrate our analysis procedure .",
    "before we can image , we write the koonin - pratt equation in a covariant form .",
    "this is important because the imaging is simplest in the pair cm frame , yet the data is often tabulated in an entirely different frame .",
    "we begin with the measured correlation which written as a convolution of the final state wavefunction with a relative distance distribution : @xmath13 here the relative distance distribution , @xmath14 , is the probability of emitting a pair with a space - time separation @xmath15 .",
    "each particle has approximately momentum @xmath16 ( in the smoothness approximation , the slight difference between using @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath16 is ignored @xcite ) .",
    "the relative distance distribution can be written as the convolution of emission functions for particles 1 and 2 : @xmath19 the emission functions are the normalized particle emission rates : @xmath20 this rate could in principal be computed in models such as rqmd @xcite or the blast - wave @xcite .    to make contact with eq .",
    ", we boost to the pair cm frame . since eq . is written covariantly , we may re - express it in any frame simply by replacing coordinates in the original frame with coordinates in the pair cm frame .",
    "further , since the the wavefunction is independent of the relative time , @xmath21 , in the pair cm frame , factors in the two terms of a ( anti-)symmetrized pair wavefunction or the one term of an unlike pair wavefunction . for like pairs , @xmath22 , removing the time dependence . for unlike pairs ,",
    "this phase - factor is removed by the square in . ] the time integral may be brought over to act on the relative distance distribution : @xmath23 this allows us to define the source function in the pair cm frame : @xmath24 with this source , we arrive at the koonin - pratt equation in eq .  .",
    "we use the bertsch - pratt coordinates @xcite in both @xmath25 and @xmath26 spaces and we define these coordinates in the rest frame of the interacting nuclear system .",
    "once the directions of the unit vectors are defined , we can use the coordinate system in any frame boosted relative to the system frame . in the bertsch - pratt coordinates ,",
    "the longitudinal direction @xmath27 is along the beam direction and the sideward direction @xmath28 is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction and the direction of the total pair momentum , i.e. @xmath29 the final direction , the outward direction , lies in the plane defined by the beam direction and @xmath30 .",
    "the unit vector in the outward direction @xmath31 may be obtained from the other two unit vectors : @xmath32 .",
    "together , the three unit vectors define the right - handed coordinate system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinates ] . in this figure",
    ", we also define the polar angles @xmath33 which we use when working in spherical coordinates .",
    "-space.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    our use of these coordinates does not preclude performing an azimuthal hbt - type analysis . in an azimuthal analysis ,",
    "the part of the total momentum vector * p * perpendicular to the longitudinal axis is further decomposed into components parallel to and perpendicular to the reaction plane . since the bertsch - pratt coordinates are defined relative to the * p * direction , a correlation ( or source ) in these coordinates can be measured ( or imaged ) with respect to the reaction plane .      to test the imaging codes ,",
    "we need to generate a test source function and correlation . to do this , we first choose the single particle source @xmath34 to use in eqs . and . then we perform the integrals in eq . using the correlation afterburner ( crab ) code @xcite to generate the correlations .",
    "we use the symmetrized relative wavefunction , including coulomb repulsion .    in the lab frame ,",
    "our single particle source is composed of a prompt source and a long - lived source : @xmath35 here , the gaussian given by @xmath36 our test single particle source is radially symmetric with @xmath37  fm , with a life - time of @xmath38  fm / c ( comparable to the @xmath39 lifetime of 23  fm / c and the system lifetime in other models @xcite ) .",
    "the fraction of pions emitted from the prompt versus long - lived source is controlled by @xmath40 and is set to @xmath41 , corresponding roughly to the number of pions created from all resonance decays in reaction simulations  @xcite .",
    "we set the source temperature to 50  mev .        to produce the source function in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_sou ] , we first generated a set of phase - space points sampled from the single particle source in eq . .",
    "we then perform the integrals in eqs . and using this set of phase - space points .",
    "since we did not have pairs with exactly the same momentum , we kept pairs with relative momentum less then 60 mev / c when computing the source function @xcite .",
    "we investigated whether this choice of affects the source function , but found no noticeable dependence .",
    "because of the low temperature of the single particle source , we include all simulated pairs ( 925260 altogether ) in the calculation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_sou ] , we see that the resulting source function is both non - gaussian and non - spherical as shown in the outward and longitudinal curves .",
    "our test correlation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_corr ] in the black points .",
    "we have chosen a much finer binning than is usually done in correlation analyses to gain resolution in the expanded correlation as we describe in the following section .",
    "one can clearly see that this test data has _ not _ been coulomb corrected in any way and that the correlation is not spherically symmetric .",
    "furthermore , one can see that the tail in the outward direction has pushed most of the correlation in the outwards direction into the coulomb hole .    .",
    "in the panels , we show 5 mev wide slices cut along each axis.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in an experiment with resolution @xmath42  mev / c , there are 40 bins in each direction if one measures to relative momentum difference @xmath43  mev / c .",
    "this means that there are @xmath44=@xmath45 elements in the data set .",
    "if we use a cartesian grid for representing the source with 10 bins in each direction , then we will need to perform @xmath46 six - dimensional integrals just to create the inversion matrix .",
    "clearly it is to our benefit to work to reduce the size of the problem .",
    "fortunately , the full three - dimensional imaging problem can be broken up into a series of 1d inversions which are much easier to handle numerically . in this section ,",
    "we first describe how we convert the full three - dimensional problem into a series of one - dimensional inversion problems by expanding the correlation and source in spherical harmonics and the kernel in legendre polynomials .",
    "next , we explain how we expand the data itself in this basis . following this",
    ", we explain our procedure for setting cut - off value @xmath47 for all the radial integrals and the cut - off order @xmath48 in our expansions .",
    "fourth , we detail the representation of the source function and we go into some detail how the kernel determines the location of the knots in the basis spline expansion of the source .",
    "the knot locations follow from the sampling theorem in fourier theory and require some discussion .",
    "finally , we describe the imaging itself .",
    "we begin by expanding the source and correlation in spherical harmonics : @xmath49 and @xmath50 we also expand the kernel in legendre polynomials in @xmath51 : @xmath52 after inserting these into the koonin - pratt equation , we simplify the result with the spherical harmonic addition theorem .",
    "doing so , the koonin - pratt equation becomes a system of linearly independent integral equations : @xmath53 instead of attempting a full three - dimensional inversion , we will attack this system of 1d inversions using the imaging techniques developed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since we focus on like - meson pairs in this paper , we write the kernels that we need . for noninteracting spin-0 bosons",
    "the kernel @xmath54 is @xmath55 if the bosons do interact , the kernel becomes a bit more complicated : @xmath56 we typically truncate the sum over @xmath57 s at several times @xmath58 , where @xmath47 and @xmath59 are the maximum values we will need for a particular data set . here",
    ", the object in the parentheses is a wigner @xmath60 symbol and the @xmath61 are the symmetrized solutions of the radial klein - gordon equation : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the coulomb phase , @xmath64 is the coulomb radial wave as defined by messiah @xcite , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . while we must include the coulomb interaction between the pair",
    ", we may neglect the short - range meson exchange potential .",
    "experimentally measured correlations are inevitably binned in @xmath26 and usually in fixed size cartesian bins .",
    "in other words , rather than measuring a continuous correlation , @xmath67 , one measures the average value of the correlation over a bin : @xmath68 here the bin index @xmath69 is shorthand for the set of three indices @xmath70 and the volume of the @xmath71 bin as @xmath72 . for fixed sized binning ,",
    "@xmath72 is constant and given by @xmath73 .",
    "if we introduce a `` window function , '' @xmath74 , where @xmath75 we can write @xmath76    for like pairs , we can reduce the number of data points by a factor of two if we notice that the correlation data must be invariant under particle label switching . in relative coordinates , this is equivalent to : @xmath77 if we align the edges of the bins along the coordinate axes , then we can reflect half of the data back on itself , simultaneously reducing the size of the data set by half and doubling the statistics on the other half . for the purpose of this paper , we will assume all @xmath26-bins with @xmath78 have been properly reflected into the @xmath79 bins .",
    "we can now convert a binned correlation in cartesian coordinates to a series of binned correlations in spherical coordinates .",
    "we invert eq . and average over radial bins : @xmath80 inserting this into , we find @xmath81 where the transform matrix @xmath82 is @xmath83    now , the data is a collection of binned one - dimensional correlations suitable for imaging .",
    "this procedure has the side effect of introducing radial bin - to - bin correlations since the cartesian bins are `` non - local '' in spherical coordinates .",
    "in fact , the uncertainties are non - trivially distributed among all the @xmath84 s since the bins in the data are re - used to compute each term .",
    "maintaining these correlations would require us to treat all terms simultaneously , resulting in a numerically intractable problem . to make progress , we ignore the cross-@xmath84 correlations , but maintain the bin - to - bin correlations .",
    "they are quantified in the covariance matrix of the radial correlation : @xmath85 in other words , the uncertainties in the correlation data are non - trivially distributed among the radial bins in the expanded correlation .",
    "we apply this scheme to the test correlation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_expanded ] we show the individual terms in the expansion .",
    "we only show @xmath86 terms , although we generated all terms up to @xmath87 from the test data .",
    "terms are zero . because of the symmetry built into our model correlation , all terms have only real parts.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fig .  [",
    "fig : corr_expanded ] , we recognize two important features .",
    "first , we see that the coulomb hole is only noticeable in the @xmath88 term",
    ". the higher @xmath57 terms also have a dip at the origin but this is a result of the analyticity of each term of the correlation rather than a coulomb induced effect .",
    "the second thing we notice is that the statistical fluctuations in the expanded data are greatly reduced .",
    "this results from the extensive angular averaging that occurs in the low @xmath57 terms .",
    "thus , by picking a seemingly unreasonable binning in @xmath26 in the original correlation , we can achieve a much higher resolution in the individual terms of the expanded correlation .",
    "as we go up in @xmath57 , the fluctuations become more intense as we begin to resolve the angular structure of the starting bins .",
    "this will require us to cut off our spherical harmonic expansion at a relatively low @xmath57 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_corr ] we show the ( reassembled ) expanded correlation in the squares alongside the original in the circles .",
    "it is clear that truncating the spherical harmonic expansion at a relatively low @xmath57 ( 2 in this case ) has not distorted the correlation and has resulted in significant smoothing of the correlation .",
    "some of the smoothing may actually be removing information from the correlation , but for the most part the smoothing removes angular noise .",
    "we must truncate our source expansion at some angular scale @xmath89 .",
    "care must be taken in choosing this @xmath48 : if @xmath48 is too low , then the higher angular scale structure in the source will be lost .",
    "actually , the problem is worse than this  this higher angular structure can be mistaken for noise in the data @xcite , interfering with the angular components we otherwise seek . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath48 is too large , other problems may arise .",
    "a large @xmath48 may be large enough to sample the high frequency angular structure imposed by the cartesian binning at large @xmath90 .",
    "also , since the number of pairs often drop at @xmath90 increases , statistical fluctuations in the high-@xmath90 bins may result in _ angular _ aliasing . for a discussion of aliasing , see either ref .",
    "@xcite or  @xcite . in practice , we can set both @xmath48 and @xmath47 simply by visually inspecting the terms in the correlation expansion . in the next subsection",
    "we will introduce a coarser scheme for setting @xmath48 and @xmath47 that is nevertheless interesting because of its relation to the space - averaged phase - space density .",
    "we conclude this subsection by describing the physical meaning of the terms in the expansion :    * angle integrated shape .",
    "the @xmath91 term _ is _ the @xmath92 correlation if one is analyzing a like pair correlation .",
    "this term is sensitive mainly to @xmath93 .",
    "* dipole distortion .",
    "the longitudinal and outwards directions are sensitive to any emission time offset ( i.e. the `` lednicky offset '' @xcite ) .",
    "if the temporal offset occurs in the longitudinally co - moving frame , the offset will show up in the @xmath94 term .",
    "if the offset occurs in the colliding nuclei s frame , this offset will show up in both the @xmath95 and @xmath94 terms .",
    "these terms are absent for like pairs .",
    "* quadrupole distortion .",
    "these terms give the main shape of the correlation so are sensitive to the deviation of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 from @xmath93 .",
    "the @xmath99 term gives @xmath98 while linear combinations of the @xmath100 and @xmath101 terms give @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "* octapole or triaxial distortion .",
    "these terms are responsible for making the source look something like a `` boomerang '' and are absent for like pairs .",
    "* hexadecapole distortion .",
    "these terms are responsible for making the source more `` box - like . ''      in this section , we introduce two integral measures of the correlation data : the `` bump volume '' and the spectral power .",
    "these measures can be used to estimate both @xmath48 and @xmath47 , but are perhaps more useful as a gross characterization of the structure of the full three - dimensional correlation .",
    "the `` bump volume '' is simply the volume integral of the correlation : @xmath102 this corresponds to the `` bump volume '' @xcite and is directly related to the space averaged phase - space density @xcite , @xmath103 , for identical non - interacting pairs through @xmath104 this relation is a direct consequence of eq .",
    "( 17 ) in ref . @xcite and the sum rule of the correlation described in ref .",
    "@xcite . unfortunately , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , this sum rule can not be applied reliably to data in the presence of final - state interactions .",
    "nevertheless , we have plotted this volume in fig .",
    "[ fig : bump_integral ] for the test problem .",
    "we note that the integral is essentially flat past @xmath105 mev / c , indicating there is no information accessible in the correlation past this momentum . in practice",
    "we may have to individually tune @xmath47 for each term in the spherical harmonic expansion of the correlation .",
    "a related measure of the correlation is the spectral power : @xmath106 this integral gives an indication as to how much of the correlation is in each @xmath57 in the @xmath107 expansion of the correlation . the correlation is squared in eq . , allowing us to assess the angular content of a correlation even if it dips below 1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : power_spec ] , we show the power spectrum of the model correlation .",
    "it flattens past @xmath108 indicating there is no angular information past this order .",
    "in fact , for this test correlation , it is safe to truncate at an even more aggressive @xmath109 .      as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we write the radial dependence in of the source functions in terms of basis splines ( denoted by @xmath110 )  @xcite : @xmath111 basis splines are piece - wise polynomials which are commonly used to approximate functions .",
    "basis splines are a type of spline that has some computational benefits over more commonly used splines such as cubic splines  @xcite . a detailed description of basis splines is contained in @xcite .    to a large extent ,",
    "the quality of any spline approximation of a function is determined by the locations of the knots .",
    "knots are the points where the polynomials that make up each spline are pasted together . if there is some sharp feature in the function to be approximated , then we need a high knot density there to resolve the feature . on the other hand ,",
    "if the function is smooth and slowly varying over some range , it makes sense to have very few knots there .",
    "we would like to engineer a basis spline expansion such that the approximated source function agrees with the true source function at a set of collocation points @xmath112 on the interval @xmath113 $ ] .",
    "in other words , @xmath114 in general , finding the optimal knots @xmath115 that minimize the distance between the original function and the approximation in some function space metric is a surprisingly difficult problem .",
    "de boor @xcite presents several schemes for determining these optimal knots and all of these schemes begin with the nearly optimal choice of @xmath116 because de boor states that this choice is often close enough to the optimal knots for practical purposes , we adopt these knots for our work .    our problem is somewhat more complicated in that we want the optimal knots for the _ convolution _ of the fitted function with some other function , namely the kernel of the koonin - pratt equation . in the next subsection",
    ", we will describe how we use the sampling theorem to find the collocation points .      the choice of the collocation points for the source and bins for the correlation play a surprisingly important role in setting the quality of the imaging results .",
    "this issue was explored in ref .",
    "@xcite leading to the development of the `` optimized discretization '' technique",
    ". this technique can be costly to apply , so we investigate a computationally cheaper alternative approach . what may be surprising is that the choice of binning in the data also plays a large role in shaping the quality of the inversion .",
    "this problem is known in astronomical imaging @xcite and has its root in the sampling theorem in fourier theory . in this section",
    ", we will outline the conclusions for the binning from the sampling theorem , but we will defer a detailed study to a future publication .    in practice , both @xmath117 and @xmath118 are _ bandwidth limited _ meaning that they are effectively zero outside some range . for @xmath117 ,",
    "this is easy to see .",
    "after some high @xmath90 , namely @xmath119 , the data is fluctuating about zero and is statistically indistinguishable from zero .",
    "similarly , @xmath118 is cut - off at some high @xmath120 because most particles are emitted from the reaction zone with finite extent . for those particles that are produced from resonance decays , the decay rate drops exponentially and at some point",
    "the production rate is effectively zero .",
    "these bandwidth limits have important implications that we now work through .",
    "since each term in the correlation expansion has compact support , we may expand them in terms of spherical bessel functions , with the requirement that @xmath121 : @xmath122 here , @xmath123 is the @xmath124 zero of the @xmath125 spherical bessel function . using the koonin - pratt equation we can determine the coefficients in this expansion : @xmath126 here @xmath127 .",
    "we can see the meaning of this equation by considering the simple case of non - interacting spin-0 bosons : @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "in other words , the value of the source at a few specific points completely determines the correlation . since the source also has compact support : @xmath130 using this , we can show that @xmath131 in other words , the source itself is completely determined by the correlation at a few points . both eqs . and are statements of the sampling theorem .",
    "why are the points @xmath132 and @xmath133 so important ?",
    "well , if we specialize to the @xmath134 case , we see that the size bins in the @xmath90-space are related to @xmath120 ( and the the size bins in the @xmath135-space are related to @xmath119 ) in a simple manner owing to the fact that @xmath136 : @xmath137 in other words , the largest scale in one space determines the smallest resolved scale in the fourier transform space .",
    " pose an interesting chicken and egg problem ; these equations imply that there is an optimal binning for a correlation given its underlying source .    note that the collocation points will be equally spaced for @xmath138 , but not for higher @xmath57 .",
    "in fact , at low @xmath135 , the higher @xmath57 kernels simply do not have the resolution to determine the source : all spherical bessel functions go to zero as @xmath139 like @xmath140 @xcite .",
    "this means that there is a `` dead zone '' at @xmath141 for all @xmath57 except @xmath138 .",
    "this dead zone occurs in the general case as well .",
    "this tells us that the collocation points should be more spaced out at low @xmath135 .    in practice",
    ", interactions distort the kernels from the simple fourier kernels . since the zeros of the kernel determine the spacing of the collocation points in eqs .   and   for simple fourier kernels",
    ", we expect that the zeros of more complicated like - pair kernels to play the same role . for the like - meson kernel with coulomb turned on ,",
    "the zeros obtain a @xmath90 dependence and this is easily taken into account . for non - identical pairs",
    ", there are no zeros in the wavefunctions and our method will fail .",
    "we will investigate alternative strategies for non - identical pairs at a later date .      by combining eqs .   and",
    ", we convert the koonin - pratt equation into a matrix equation : @xmath142 we proceed as in refs .",

    "reading off the half widths and source height , we can compute equivalent gaussian radii .",
    "we find @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath161 surprisingly close to the @xmath162 we put in to the test source .",
    "the radii are a bit higher than the radii we put into the single particle source in eq . .",
    "this is a result of the mixing of the space and time directions in the construction of the source function in eq . .",
    "in the end , it is clear that we not only can image reliably in 3d , but we can do it with the same precision as we could in one dimension .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced an extension to the source imaging method from refs .",
    "@xcite for imaging full three - dimensional correlations .",
    "this extension relies on spherical harmonic expansion of the correlation and source functions , effectively converting an intractable three - dimensional inversion to a set of simple one - dimensional inversions .",
    "we have demonstrated this technique on a seemingly simple model in which a non - gaussian and non - spherical source tail is generated from a simple gaussian single particle source with finite lifetime . within this model , we have shown that we can resolve the core radii to a level comparable to gaussian fits .",
    "we have also shown that we go far beyond this by resolving the detailed aspherical shape of any non - gaussian tails of the source .    while we have shown the techniques efficacy only for like - pion correlations ,",
    "imaging is a general tool and is limited only by the availability of data and our ability to compute relative wavefunctions .",
    "imaging provides a means to measure source shapes and sizes for complicated final states where a gaussian fit is impossible , such as for non - identical correlations .",
    "finally , this extension to the imaging technique should shed light on the non - gaussian tails now being seen in advanced analyses of rhic two - particle correlations @xcite .",
