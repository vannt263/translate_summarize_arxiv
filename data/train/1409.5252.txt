    "the study of the structure and properties of hadrons represents one of the main directions in particle and nuclear physics .",
    "there are different approaches in investigation of the structure of hadrons , especially , the most promising one in this direction is the study of the radiative decays and electromagnetic properties of the hadrons and their excitations ( for a review , see for example @xcite ) .",
    "negative parity partners of the octet baryons arise from increasing of orbital angular momentum by one unit .",
    "the investigation of the magnetic moment of the negative parity baryons can provide us useful information about their internal structure .",
    "note that the study of the magnetic moment of the @xmath1 baryon has already been planned at mainz microtron ( mami ) facility @xcite and jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty in measurement of the magnetic moments of the excited baryons is can be attributed to the considerably large width they posses .",
    "due to this fact the magnetic moments can be measured from the polarization observables of the decay products of the excited resonances .",
    "the very first effort in measuring the magnetic moment of the @xmath2 in the reaction @xmath3 has been realized at mami , and future program to get information about the magnetic moment of the @xmath4 baryon in the reaction @xmath5 has already been planned .",
    "the magnetic moments of the spin-1/2 negative parity baryons have been calculated within the nonrelativistic quark model @xcite , simple quark model @xcite , lattice qcd @xcite , chiral perturbation theory @xcite , light cone qcd sum rules ( lcsr ) @xcite , and effective hamiltonian model @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we calculate the magnetic moments of the negative parity , spin-3/2 partners of the octet baryons in framework of the lcsr method ( more about lcsr formalism can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "it should be reminded here that , theoretically there exists only one work where magnetic moment of the negative parity , spin-3/2 @xmath6-baryon is calculated in framework of the chiral quark model @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the interpolating currents for the spin-3/2 partners of the octet baryons and derive sum rules for the magnetic moments of negative parity baryons . in the same section",
    ", we also calculate the two - point correlators in order to obtain the sum rules for mass and residues of the negative parity , spin-3/2 section 3 is devoted to numerical analysis of the obtained sum rules for the magnetic moments of these baryons , and discussion and conclusion .",
    "the starting point in calculation of the magnetic moment of the negative parity , spin-3/2 baryons from the qcd side is the consideration of the following correlation function : [ ekul01 ] _ =",
    "i d^4x e^ipx 0",
    "\\ { _ ^b ( x )    current for the corresponding baryon , @xmath7 refers to the external electromagnetic field , and t is the time ordering operator .    in order to obtain the sum rules for the magnetic moments ,",
    "the correlation function is calculated in terms of hadrons and the quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "using then the quark - hadron duality ansatz these two forms of the correlation function are related by using the analytical continuation .",
    "the phenomenological part of the correlation function can be obtained by saturating it with the complete states of single particle hadronic states carrying the same quantum numbers as the interpolating currents .",
    "we get from eq.([ekul01 ] ) : [ ekul02 ] _ +   +   +  .    in general the current @xmath8",
    "interacts not only with spin-3/2 states , but also with spin-1/2 states . since our aim is to calculate the magnetic moments of the negative parity , spin-3/2 baryons ,",
    "the contributions coming spin-1/2 baryons must be eliminated .",
    "the prescription to eliminate these unwanted contributions can be summarized as follows .",
    "the general form of the matrix element of @xmath8 between spin-1/2 and vacuum states can be written as , [ ekul03 ] 0 _ ( p ) = ( a p_+ b _ )",
    "u(p )  . multiplying both sides with @xmath9 , and using condition",
    "@xmath10 we get , [ ekul04 ] 0 _ ( p ) = b ( - 4 m _ p_+ _ ) u(p )  , and similarly , [ ekul05 ] 0 _ ( p ) = b _ 5 ( - 4 m _",
    "we see from eqs .",
    "( [ ekul04 ] ) and ( [ ekul05 ] ) that the unwanted spin-1/2 state contributions are proportional to either @xmath11 or @xmath12 , and they must be eliminated .",
    "for this goal an ordering procedure of the dirac matrices is needed which is necessary in obtaining the independent structures . in the present study",
    "the ordering of the dirac matrices chosen is @xmath13 . in the light of these remarks",
    "we can now proceed to calculate @xmath14 given in eq .",
    "( [ ekul02 ] ) in terms of hadrons , for which the following matrix elements are needed , [ ekul06 ] 0 _ ( p ) _",

    "the matrix element @xmath16 is determined in the following way : [ ekul07 ] b _ ( p_2 ) b _ ( p_1 ) _ _",

    "( [ ekul07 ] ) by making the replacements of the form factors as , [ nolabel01 ] f_i f_i^ ,  g_i g_i^ ,   f_i f_i^tr ,  g_i g_i^tr , respectively . for the @xmath22 transition",
    "the matrix element such as given in eq .",
    "( [ ekul07 ] ) should contain @xmath23 matrix before the rarita - schwinger spinor @xmath24 , which follows from the parity consideration .",
    "note that for the real photons the terms multiplying @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be neglected since @xmath27 .",
    "summation over spin-3/2 states is performed according to the following formula : [ ekul08 ] _",
    "s u_(p , s ) |u_(p , s ) = - ( /p + m )  .",
    "it should be remembered again that the terms proportional to @xmath12 on the left and those to @xmath28 on the right ; as well as to @xmath29 and @xmath30 contain contributions from spin-1/2 states ( see eqs .",
    "( [ ekul04 ] ) and ( [ ekul05 ] ) ) , and therefore can be neglected .",
    "after elimination of the spin-1/2 states , the only structure that contains contributions from spin-3/2 states is @xmath31 . as a result ,",

    "it follows from eq.([ekul10 ] ) that only the last term describes the magnetic moment of the negative parity baryons . denoting by , [ ekul11 ] a + b + c + d  . on the hadronic side , for the invariant function with the structure @xmath36",
    ", we have [ ekul12 ] & &  , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "note that in determination of the magnetic moments we need the values of the form factors only at @xmath19 .",
    "now let us turn our attention to the calculation of the correlator function from the qcd side .",
    "for this goal , as has already been noted , we need the form of the interpolating currents of the excited state baryons .",

    "( [ ekul16 ] ) .    these contributions ,",
    "obviously , are described by the matrix elements of the nonlocal operators @xmath52 and @xmath53 between the vacuum and photon states .",

    "( [ ekul14 ] ) and the explicit expression for the light quark operator given in eq .",
    "( [ ekul16 ] ) , and the definitions of the nonlocal quark operators between the photon and vacuum states in terms of the photon das , we can perform the calculation for the theoretical part of the correlation function .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ ekul12 ] ) that , in order to determine the coefficient @xmath54 , which contain the magnetic moment of the negative parity , spin-3/2 baryons , we need four equations . for this aim",
    "we choose the structures @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . denoting the invariant functions of these structures by @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , we get the following four equations , [ nolabe03 ] -2 m_+ ( a+b ) + 2 m_- ( c+d ) _ 1 + -2 ( a+b+c+d ) _ 2 + ( b - c ) ( m_+ + m_- )",
    "_ 3 + ( c m_- + b m_+ ) ( m_++m_- ) _ 4  .",
    "solving these equations for @xmath54 , we get [ ekul18 ] d = 12 ( m_+ + m_-)^2  .",
    "the final step for obtaining the sum rules for the magnetic moments is performing double borel transformation with respect to the variables @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and subtracting higher states and continuum contributions . performing all these operations in the appropriate order , for the magnetic moment of negative parity baryons we get , [ ekul19 ] 3  , where we take @xmath65 , @xmath66 , with @xmath67 is being the borel mass parameter ; and @xmath68 are the expressions of the corresponding invariant functions after performing the borel transformation .",
    "the expressions of @xmath68 quite lengthy , and for this reason we do not present their explicit expressions .",
    "having obtained the final result for determination of the magnetic moment of the negative parity , spin-3/2 baryons , which is given in eq .",
    "( [ ekul18 ] ) , we now need to calculate their overlap amplitudes ( residues ) .",

    "the values of the input parameters which enter to the sum rules for the magnetic moments are : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 @xcite , @xmath75 @xcite , @xmath76 @xcite , and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient of the light cone sum rules are the das . in our problem",
    "we need the photon das , whose analytic expressions are presented in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above - presented input parameters and photon das , sum rules involve the borel mass parameter @xmath67 and continuum threshold @xmath78 as well . since these two parameters are the auxiliary ones , the magnetic moments should be independent of them .",
    "the continuum threshold is not totally arbitrary , and it is correlated to the energy of the first excited states .",
    "it is usually chosen in the region @xmath79 .",
    "the working region of the borel mass parameter @xmath67 is determined in the following way . in order to obtain the upper bound of @xmath67 we require that the continuum and higher states contributions are less than , say , 30% of the perturbative contributions .",
    "the lower bound of @xmath67 is determined from the requirement that the contribution of the highest power of @xmath80 terms should be less than 25% of the highest @xmath67 contributions .",
    "these two requirements lead the following results for the working regions of @xmath67 : [ nolabel05 ] & & 1 m^2 3  gev^2  , + & & 1.5 m^2 3.5  gev^2  , . in these regions of the borel mass parameter @xmath67 , the results for the magnetic moments of the negative parity , spin-3/2 baryons are very weakly dependent on @xmath67 and @xmath78 . as an example , we present in fig .",

    "we deduce from this figure that @xmath82 .    the results for the other excited states of negative parity , spin-3/2 baryons are presented in table 1 .",
    "@xmath83    we see from this table that , the value of the magnetic moments of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , as well as , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are very close to each other , which follows from the small difference in magnetic moments due to the su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects .",
    "moreover , in exact su(3 ) symmetry , the values of the magnetic moments of @xmath88 and @xmath89 should be equal to zero .",
    "indeed , our results show that they have quite small values , and these small nonzero values of the magnetic moments of the relevant baryons can be attributed to the su(3 ) symmetry breaking .",
    "it should finally be mentioned here that , in exact su(3 ) symmetry limit , the relation [ nolabel05 ] _",
    "^0 = 12 ( _ ^+ + _",
    "^- )   should be satisfied , which is also confirmed by our results .",
    "the apparent small deviation can again be attributed to the su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects .    in conclusion ,",
