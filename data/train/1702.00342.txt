    "rank semisimple lie groups , the local rigidity is a consequence of the much stronger property : super - rigidity , which was proved by margulis @xcite .",
    "our aim here , is to present a simple proof of the following theorem :    [ thm1 ] under the necessary conditions on @xmath0 and @xmath3 , if @xmath17 is a deformation , close enough to the identity @xmath8 , then @xmath24 is a lattice and @xmath17 is an isomorphism .    in the higher rank case , we need the lattice to be arithmetic , which is always true by margulis theorem . but",
    "this is of course cheating .",
    "anyway our method provides , for example , a simple geometric proof of the local rigidity of @xmath25 in @xmath26 for @xmath20 .",
    "note also that margulis arithmeticity theorem is easier in the non compact case @xcite ( it does not rely on super - rigidity ) which is the only case we need here .    in fact , we prove a `` stronger '' result than the statement of theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "namely , if @xmath27 is the associated symmetric space , then for a small deformation @xmath17 , @xmath28 is homeomorphic to @xmath29 and @xmath30 is an isomorphism .    with theorem [ thm1 ]",
    ", local rigidity follows from mostow rigidity .",
    "recall that mostow s rigidity theorem @xcite says that if @xmath0 is a connected semisimple lie group not locally isomorphic to @xmath21 , and @xmath31 are isomorphic irreducible lattices in @xmath0 , then they are conjugate in @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath32 for some @xmath14 .",
    "in selberg s paper @xcite a main difficulty was to prove a weaker version of [ thm1 ] in his special case .",
    "selberg also indicated that his proof ( which is quite elementary and very elegant ) would work for more general higher rank cases if the general version ( [ thm1 ] above ) of his lemma 9 could be proved .",
    "this supports the general feeling that it should be possible to give a complete elementary proof of local rigidity which does not rely on mostow s rigidity .",
    "however , the authors decided not to strain too much , in trying to avoid mostow rigidity , since in the rank one case there are by now very elegant and straightforward proofs of mostow rigidity ( such as the proof of gromov and thurston ( see @xcite ) for compact hyperbolic manifolds , and of besson , courtois and gallot @xcite for the general rank one case , note also that mostow s original proof is much simpler in the rank one case ) while for higher rank spaces the much stronger margulis supper - rigidity holds .",
    "our proof of theorem [ thm1 ] relies on an old principle implicit in ehresmann s work and to our knowledge first made explicit in thurston s notes .",
    "this principle implies in particular that any sufficiently small deformation of a cocompact lattice in a lie group stays a lattice .",
    "it seems to have remained unknown for many years , as both selberg and weil spent some effort in proving partial cases of it .",
    "it is by now fairly well known , but the authors could not find a complete written proof of it in the literature although everyone knows that it is implicit in ehresmann s work . in the second section of this paper , we thus decided to write a complete proof , using ehresmann s beautiful viewpoint , of a slight generalization of this principle to the non - compact case needed for our purpose . in the third section",
    "we prove theorem [ thm1 ] in the rank one case . in the last section",
    "we prove theorem [ thm1 ] for arithmetic lattices of higher rank .",
    "non - uniform lattices in the group @xmath33 are not locally rigid , although mostow rigidity is valid for @xmath34 .",
    "this shows that local rigidity is not a straightforward consequence of mostow rigidity .",
    "moreover , it was shown by thurston that if @xmath35 is a non - uniform lattice then there is an infinite family of small deformations @xmath36 of @xmath3 such that @xmath37 is again a lattice , but not isomorphic to @xmath3 , and in fact many of the @xmath37 s may be constructed to be uniform .",
    "the proof which we present in this note is in a sense a product of our attempt to understand and formulate why similar phenomenon can not happen in higher dimensions .",
    "in fact , we shall show that some weak version of local rigidity is valid also for non - uniform lattices in @xmath34 .",
    "this would allow us to obtain a direct proof of the fact that for any ( non - uniform ) lattice in @xmath38 ( as well as in any connected @xmath0 which is defined over @xmath39 as an algebraic group and is locally isomorphic to @xmath23 ) , there is an algebraic number field @xmath40 , and an element @xmath14 , such that @xmath41 .",
    "this fact ( which is well known in the general case for any lattice in any @xmath0 which is not locally isomorphic to @xmath21 ) can be proved by a few line argument when @xmath3 is locally rigid in @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath0 is locally isomorphic to @xmath23 , and @xmath1 is non - uniform ( and hence not locally rigid ) , this was proved in @xcite , section 8 , by a special and longer argument .",
    "our method allows to unify this special case to the general case .    in section [ ehresmann - thurston ] we shall formulate and prove the ehresmann - thurston principle and use it in order to prove local rigidity for uniform lattices ( weil s theorem ) . in section [ rank-1 ] , which is in a sense the main contribution of this note",
    ", we shall present a complete and elementary proof for local rigidity of non - uniform lattices in groups of rank one ( originally due to garland and raghunathan ) .",
    "then , in section [ higher - rank ] , we shall apply our method to higher - rank non - uniform lattices .",
    "in some cases , our proof remains completely elementary .",

    "we can do this in particular for closed paths representing generators of the fundamental group @xmath46 .",
    "starting from one of the open sets @xmath47 of the given atlas , the development produces a covering space @xmath48 of @xmath44 , a representation @xmath49 called the holonomy and a structure preserving immersion , the developing map @xmath50 , which is equivariant with respect to the action of @xmath46 on @xmath48 and of @xmath51 on @xmath42 .",

    "when the @xmath43-connection is induced by a @xmath43-structure on @xmath44 , this map is the usual holonomy map of the @xmath43-structure .",
    "@xmath60 can be described as the quotient @xmath79 where the action is the diagonal one , with @xmath46 acting on @xmath48 by covering transformations and on @xmath42 via the holonomy map through the action of @xmath0 on @xmath42 .",
    "the development of a curve ending at @xmath80 , is obtained by dragging along @xmath73 the corresponding points until they arrive in the fiber @xmath75 .",
    "as soon as the connection @xmath73 is flat , homotopic curves with common initial and end points give the same image of the initial point in the end fiber and the development map @xmath81 is well defined .",
    "we thus conclude that any flat @xmath43-connection on a manifold @xmath44 yields a @xmath43-structure .",
    "it is then an easy matter to prove the following useful result , which to our knowledge first appeared in a slightly different setup in thurston s notes @xcite , but which , as we will see , and seems to be a common knowledge , is elementary using ehresmann s viewpoint of @xmath43-structures . for a slightly different proof ,",

    "moreover , the boundary of @xmath420 , which is a level set of @xmath421 , consists of projections of subsets of horospheres in @xmath42 .",
    "we can choose a sufficiently large @xmath422 in order to ensure that for any @xmath423 , @xmath424 is a collar neighborhood of the boundary of @xmath425 inside @xmath420 . in the following",

    ", there is a @xmath43-structure @xmath427 on @xmath216 whose holonomy is @xmath17 and which induces a new @xmath43-structure on @xmath424 .",
    "the fundamental group of @xmath424 is a finite complex of groups @xmath428 where each simplex group is the intersection @xmath429 for some @xmath39-parabolic subgroup @xmath283 of @xmath0 and the inclusion order for simplices is the reversed inclusion order for the corresponding parabolic groups . in particular the vertex groups correspond to the @xmath3-conjugacy classes of maximal @xmath39-parabolics .",
    "the proof of proposition 3.3 in @xcite implies that any finite complex of groups as above leaves invariant a countable union of horospheres of @xmath42 ( level sets of busemann functions ) centered at the points of the ideal boundary of @xmath42 which corresponds to the vertices of the complex .",
    "in fact , leuzinger proves that the developing map of @xmath216 embeds @xmath430 in @xmath42 as the complement @xmath431 of countable union of open horoballs .",
