    ", the breaking of translational invariance along the growth direction ( @xmath11-direction ) leads to the coupling of qw excitons to a continuum of bulk photon modes .",
    "this results in an irreversible radiative decay of low - energy qw excitons into the bulk photon modes and to interface , or qw , polaritons for the qw exciton states lying outside the photon cone @xcite .",
    "an interface polariton is the in - plane propagating eigenwave guided by a single qw , and the light field associated with interface polaritons is evanescent , i.e. , it decays exponentially in the @xmath11-direction .",
    "in contrast , the mc polariton optics deals with the quasi - stationary mixed states of quasi-2d mc photons and qw excitons @xcite , i.e. , one realizes a nearly pure 2d exciton - photon system with resonant coupling between two eigenmodes ( for a review of the mc polariton optics see , e.g. , refs . [ ] ) . in this case",
    "the radiative lifetime of mc polaritons originates from a finite transmission through the cavity mirrors .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to develop coherent optics of quasi-2d excitonic molecules in semiconductor microcavities .",
    "the xx - mediated optical response from gaas microcavities has been addressed only recently @xcite .",
    "the coulombic attractive interaction of cross - circular polarized ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) excitons , which gives rise to the xx bound state , has been invoked and estimated in order to analyze the frequency - degenerate four - wave mixing ( fwm ) experiment @xcite .",

    "however , in the above first experiments the microcavity polariton resonance has large broadening so that the spectrally  resolved xx transition was not detected .",
    "only recently the spectrally  resolved `` polariton @xmath14 xx '' photon - assisted transition in gaas - based mcs has been observed by using differential reflection spectroscopy @xcite . in particular , the transition is revealed in a pump  probe experiment as an induced absorption from the lower polariton dispersion branch to the xx state , at positive pump - probe time delays @xcite . in the latter work",
    "the mc rabi splitting @xmath15 , associated with a heavy  hole qw exciton , exceeds the xx binding energy @xmath3 for more than a factor of three .",
    "the last experiments on excitonic molecules in gaas microcavities use a high - intensity laser field to investigate the xx - mediated changes in the polariton spectrum @xcite and parametric scattering of mc polaritons @xcite . in this work",
    "we are dealing with a _ low - intensity _ limit of the xx optics , aiming to study the radiative corrections to the molecule state in a high - quality gaas single qw embedded in a co - planar @xmath4-cavity .",
    "recently , the optical properties of large binding energy excitonic molecules in a mc - embedded znse qw has been studied @xcite .",
    "the theoretical model we work out can straightforwardly be adapted to the quasi-2d molecules in ii - vi nanostructures .    in the previous theoretical studies @xcite the xx radiative corrections",
    "are not included , so that the models deal with the optically unperturbed molecule wavefunction @xmath16 and binding energy @xmath3 .",
    "according to ref .",
    "[ ] , the xx radiative corrections are rather small , even if @xmath17 .",
    "the authors argue qualitatively that a volume of phase space , where the resonant coupling of the constituent excitons with the light field occurs , is rather small to affect the xx state .",
    "as we show below , an exactly - solvable bipolariton model @xcite , adapted to excitonic molecules in gaas - based quasi-2d nanostructures , yields @xmath1 and @xmath0 of about @xmath18 for microcavities , and @xmath10 and @xmath19 of about @xmath20 for single qws .",
    "the calculated values refer to the weak confinement of qw excitons and qw excitonic molecules we deal with in our study . in the weak confinement limit ,",
    "the qw thickness @xmath21 is comparable with the in - plane radius of the above electron - hole bound complexes , which are still constructed in terms of well - defined transversly - quantized quasi-2d electronic states .",
    "in contrast , in the strong confinement limit , @xmath21 is much less than the in - plane radius of qw excitons ( excitonic molecules ) .",
    "the radiative corrections to the xx state can not be neglected , because the exciton - photon coupling ( polariton effect ) changes the dispersion of excitons not only in a very close vicinity of the resonant crossover between the relevant exciton and photon energies , but in a rather broad band @xmath22 . here",

    "for gaas structures @xmath26 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath27 , which scales the xx radiative corrections , is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the molecule radius and @xmath30 is the dimensionality of a semiconductor structure .",
    "remarkably , as we demonstrate below , @xmath31 does not depend upon the mc detuning between the @xmath4-cavity mode and @xmath32 , i.e. , is the same for microcavities and single qws . for our high - quality gaas qws with weak confinement of excitons one",
    "estimates @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 .",
    "the latter value clearly shows that the exciton - photon coupling does change considerably the quasi-2d xx states . even for the x wavevectors far away from the resonant crossover point @xmath23",
    ", the polariton effect can still have a considerable impact on the dispersion of optically - dressed excitons in bulk semiconductors and qws . to illustrate this , note that for bulk gaas , e.g.",
    ", the effective mass associated with the upper polariton dispersion branch at @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 , i.e. , by factor four is less than the translational mass @xmath37 of optically undressed excitons . in a similar way , the dispersion of qw excitons dressed by mc photons , which gives rise to @xmath38 and @xmath1 , refers to the in - plane wavevector domain @xmath39 rather than to a close vicinity of the crossover point @xmath40 .",
    "an excitonic molecule can be described in terms of two quasi - bound polaritons ( bipolariton ) , if the coupling of the molecule with the light field is much stronger than the incoherent scattering processes . in this case",
    "the sequence `` two incoming polaritons ( or bulk photons ) @xmath5 quasi - bound xx state @xmath5 two outgoing polaritons '' is a completely coherent process of the resonant polariton - polariton scattering and can be described in terms of the bipolariton wavefunction @xmath41 .",
    "the latter includes an inherent contribution from the outgoing ( incoming ) polaritons and should be found from the bipolariton wave equation .",
    "the solution also yields the radiative corrections to the xx energy , i.e. , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the `` input '' xx binding energy of an optically inactive molecule .",
    "for some particular model potentials of @xmath12-exciton ",
    "@xmath13-exciton interaction , e.g. , for the deuteron and gaussian potentials , the bipolariton wave equation can be solved exactly @xcite .",
    "the bipolariton concept was verified in high - precision experiments with low - temperature bulk cucl @xcite and cds @xcite , and was also applied successfully to explain the xx - mediated optical response from gaas / algaas multiple qws @xcite .",
    "the latter experiment dealt with quasi-2d xxs in the limit of strong qw confinement . in this case",
    "the bipolariton model shows that the main channel of the optical decay of qw excitonic molecules in mc - free structures is the resonant photon - assisted dissociation of the molecule into two outgoing interface ( qw ) polaritons .",
    "note that the coulombic interaction between two constituent excitons of the molecule couples the radiative modes and the interface polariton states , so that an `` umklapp '' process between the modes can intrinsically be realized .",
    "the above picture refers to the following scenario of the coherent optical generation and dissociation of qw molecules : `` @xmath12 bulk photon + @xmath13 bulk photon @xmath5 @xmath12 virtual qw exciton + @xmath13 virtual qw exciton @xmath5 qw molecule @xmath5 @xmath12 interface polariton + @xmath13 interface polariton '' .",
    "the experiments we report on deal with weakly confined qw excitonic molecules , i.e. , the qw thickness @xmath44 is comparable with the radius of excitons in bulk gaas .",
    "the quasi-2d weak confinement allows us to neglect inhomogeneous broadening in the detected x- and xx - mediated signals .",
    "the mc - free single qw is used as a reference structure : all the @xmath4-microcavities , which we study , are embedded with a single qw nearly identical to the reference one . by analyzing the coherent dynamics of the xx - mediated signal in spectrally - resolved transient fwm , we infer the xx radiative width in the microcavities and in the reference single qw , @xmath1 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the measurements yield @xmath1 larger than @xmath10 by nearly factor two .",
    "furthermore , by using pump - probe spectroscopy we also estimate the xx binding energies @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "our measurements deal with the mc detuning band @xmath47 .",
    "similarly to quasi-2d xxs in high - quality single qws , the main mechanism of the optical decay of mc molecules is their in - plane resonant dissociation into mc polaritons .",
    "thus the coherent optical path of the xx - mediated signal in our experiments is given by `` @xmath12 ( pump ) bulk photon + @xmath13 ( pump ) bulk photon @xmath5 mc molecule @xmath5 @xmath12 mc polariton + @xmath13 mc polariton @xmath5 @xmath12 ( signal ) bulk photon + @xmath13 ( signal ) bulk photon '' .",
    "the latter escape of the mc polaritons into the bulk photon modes is due to a finite radiative lifetime of mc photons . in order to explain the experimental data , the bipolariton model is adapted to weakly confined quasi-2d molecules in ( gaas ) microcavities and mc - free ( gaas ) single qws .",
    "one of the most important features of the optics of excitonic molecules in microcavities is a large contribution to the bipolariton state @xmath41 from @xmath48-mode mc polaritons .",
    "the relevant @xmath48-mode polariton states refer to the in - plane wavevectors @xmath49 , i.e. , are short - wavelength in comparison with the @xmath50-mode polariton states activated in standard optical experiments .",
    "an `` invisible '' decay channel of the mc molecule into two outgoing @xmath48-mode polaritons in combination with the directly observable dissociation path `` xx @xmath5 @xmath50-mode mc polariton + @xmath50-mode mc polariton '' explain qualitatively the factor two difference between @xmath1 and @xmath10 .",

    "the bipolariton model quantitatively reproduces our experimental data and predicts new spectral features , like @xmath51 critical points in the detuning dependent @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "thus the main results of our study on weakly confined quasi-2d molecules in gaas microcavities are ( i ) rigorous justification of the bipolariton model , ( ii ) importance of the xx radiative corrections , and ( iii ) existence of the efficient `` hidden '' xx decay channel , associated with 0@xmath4-mode mc polaritons .    in sec.ii",
    ", we apply the bipolariton model in order to analyze the xx radiative corrections , the xx lamb shift @xmath54 and xx radiative width @xmath55 , relevant to our microcavities and reference qw . after a brief discussion of interface and mc polaritons",
    ", we demonstrated that in gaas - based quasi-2d structures the xx radiative corrections can be as large as @xmath2 of the ( input ) xx binding energy @xmath56 .",
    "it is shown that independently of the mc detuning @xmath57 the xx radiative corrections in microcavities and ( reference ) qws are scaled by the same dimensionless parameter @xmath58 , and that the main xx optical decay channels in microcavities are `` xx @xmath5 1@xmath4-mode mc polariton + 1@xmath4-mode mc polariton '' and `` xx @xmath5 0@xmath4-mode mc polariton + 0@xmath4-mode mc polariton '' against the main decay path in single qws , `` xx @xmath5 interface polariton + interface polariton '' .",
