    "@xcite and by modifying also , simultaneously , the spin  orbit strength .",
    "this work was done as an exploratory study to identify the correct signs and regions for the values of the tensor parameters , and can be viewed as a preparatory study for a global fit of all the parameters , especially in the gogny case , where much less work has been done including the tensor force .    in the present work ,",
    "we employ one of the skyrme parametrizations introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and show that ( even if it was not found with an adjustment of all the parameters of the force ) it properly accounts , within a mean  field picture , for shell effects that were recently confirmed by experimental measurements , namely the magicity of the calcium isotopes @xmath0ca and @xmath1ca .    experimental studies strongly indicate @xmath2 as a new magic number in ca isotopes due to the high energy of the first 2@xmath6 state in this nucleus @xcite .",
    "more recently , high  precision mass measurements were performed for the neutron ",
    "rich ca isotopes @xmath7ca and @xmath1ca by employing the mass spectrometer of isoltrap at cern @xcite . the found results and , in particular , the trend obtained for the two  neutron separation energies @xmath8 , definitely confirmed the magicity of the nucleus @xmath0ca . for the nucleus @xmath1ca ,",
    "the first experimental spectroscopic study on low  lying states was performed very recently with proton knockout reactions at riken @xcite .",
    "this study ( in particular , the high energy of the first @xmath9 state ) provided a robust experimental signature indicating the magic nature of the nucleus @xmath1ca .",

    "we do not need more sophisticated models because our objective is to isolate the genuine tensor contribution : we show that the tensor force , and its induced like  particle and n ",

    "it is shown in particular that an enhancement of the magicity of @xmath0ca and @xmath1ca may be predicted within mean  field calculations by including the like  particle contribution generated by the tensor force .",

    "the difference of our skyrme parameter set with respect to the tensor parametrization published by col _",

    "we evaluate the single  particle neutron gap for four ca isotopes , the closed ",

    "ca isotopes are spin saturated in protons .",
    "this means that tensor effects on neutron single  particle states may be induced in practice only by the like  particle neutron  neutron ( n ",
    "n ) contribution along the isotopic chain .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 the single  particle gaps obtained for the four isotopes with our effective skyrme force by quenching the like  particle tensor strength ( dashed line ) and by switching it on ( solid line ) .",
    "the reported gaps refer to @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 for @xmath11ca , @xmath12ca , @xmath0ca , and @xmath1ca , respectively .",
    "two effects may be observed .",
    "first , a global enhancement of the single  particle gaps is visible due to the tensor contribution .",
    "this enhancement is found also for the closed ",
    "shell nucleus @xmath12ca , where the gap is increased by 1.3 mev .",
    "the corresponding experimental value is 5.4 mev @xcite .",
    "this means that the inclusion of the n ",
    "n tensor contribution leads to the correct shift , towards the experimental result . for the nucleus @xmath11ca , the results obtained with and without the n ",
    "n tensor effect are obviously almost the same , since this nucleus is fully spin saturated and the tensor force is not active there .",
    "we notice that the gap variation due to the inclusion of the n ",
    "n tensor contribution is more important for @xmath0ca than for @xmath12ca and @xmath1ca , as will be explained below . in the figure , also the results obtained with the original sly5 force are reported ( blue dotted line ) .",
    "we may observe that our new set of parameters provides a global improvement of the results : it can be seen that both single  particle gaps obtained for @xmath11ca and @xmath12ca are closer to the experimental values ( red triangles ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , in the case of @xmath11ca , where the tensor force does not play any role , the better agreeement with the experimental gap is entirely due to the reduced strength of the spin  orbit contribution .",
    "ca , @xmath12ca , @xmath0ca , and @xmath1ca .",
    "the black solid line corresponds to the results obtained with the new skyrme force ; the black dashed line corresponds to the results obtained with the new skyrme force by neglecting the n ",
    "n tensor contribution .",
    "the results obtained by using the original sly5 force are also reported ( blue dotted line ) .",
    "the experimental values for @xmath11ca and @xmath12ca are represented by red triangles.,width=302 ]    let us investigate in detail the tensor effect for each of the three isotopes where the tensor force contributes . for @xmath12ca , the neutron @xmath27 state is filled . both high-@xmath28 ( by using the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite ) single  particle states @xmath27 and @xmath29 are pushed downwards , more strongly for the first state than for the second [ fig .",
    "the net effect is that the gap between the two levels is increased .",
    "ca ( a ) , @xmath0ca ( b ) , and @xmath1ca ( c ) with and without the like  particle tensor contribution.,width=302 ]    for @xmath0ca , the neutron @xmath29 state is filled .",
    "the high-@xmath28 @xmath29 state is pushed downwards whereas the low-@xmath28 @xmath30 state is pushed upwards [ fig .",
    "the single  particle gap is increased .    for @xmath1ca",
    ", the neutron @xmath30 state is filled .",
    "both low-@xmath28 single  particle states @xmath31 and @xmath30 are pushed upwards , more strongly for the first state than for the second [ fig .",
    "the gap increases also this time .    in particular , the stronger enhancement of the single  particle gap obtained in @xmath0ca is due to the fact that each single  particle state is pushed in the opposite direction by the tensor contribution . figs .",
    "1 and 2 clearly show that the single  particle gaps are increased in @xmath0ca and @xmath1ca due to the like  particle tensor contribution .",
    "this provides an enhancement of magicity for the two isotopes , with respect to what found by neglecting the tensor term .",
    "in particular , the gap is increased for @xmath0ca from 1.24 to 3.06 mev and for @xmath1ca from 0.45 to 1.86 mev , providing in this way nuclei that have a stronger closed  shell nature . with the opposite sign of the tensor strength",
    ", the effect would be the opposite , that is , the gap would be decreased by including the tensor contribution and would be in particular more strongly shrinked for the nucleus @xmath0ca , where the @xmath29 state would be shifted upwards and the @xmath30 state would be pushed downwards .",
    "the presently used signs of the tensor parameters are thus the correct ones that allow us to enhance the magic character of the nuclei under study .",
    "to analyze the effects of the n ",
    "p tensor contribution , isotonic chains containing @xmath0ca and @xmath1ca have to be analyzed .",
    "let us start with the @xmath2 isotones @xmath0ca , @xmath1ti , @xmath13cr , and @xmath4fe . in these nuclei ,",
    "the last occupied neutron state is the state @xmath29 , the upper level is the state @xmath30 , and the neutron gap @xmath2 thus coincides with the spin ",
    "orbit splitting of the @xmath32 neutron states .",
    "going from @xmath4fe to @xmath0ca , the @xmath33 number is reduced from 26 to 20 .",
    "the occupation of the proton state @xmath27 is thus decreased from 6 to 0 .",
    "p tensor effect is expected to provide an attractive interaction between the proton state @xmath27 and the neutron state @xmath30 and a repulsive interaction between the proton state @xmath27 and the neutron state @xmath29 in a given nucleus .",
    "such tensor contribution is thus expected to induce a reduction of the neutron @xmath34 spin ",
    "orbit splitting , that is , a reduction of the @xmath2 gap .",
    "this effect is however expected to be weakened along the isotonic chain , as far as the occupation of the proton @xmath27 state is reduced , that is , going from @xmath4fe to @xmath0ca . with the reduction of the n ",
    "p effect , the gap is expected to increase going from @xmath4fe to @xmath0ca .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "3 , where the gap is plotted ( black solid line ) and in fig .",
    "4 , where the involved proton and neutron single ",
    "particle energies are displayed . in fig .",
    "4 one can see that , moving from the left to the right ( that is , towards more neutron ",
    "rich nuclei along the isotonic chain ) , the energy of the proton state moves towards lower values and the energies of the neutron states are pushed upwards , as expected in mean  field calculations . on top of the global mean  field evolution , we should isolate the tensor contribution . from fig .",
    "3 , one observes that the expected effect of enhancement of the gap going from @xmath4fe to @xmath0ca looks very weak . to better understand how the tensor force acts in this particular case ,",
    "we compare the found results with those obtained by switching off the n  p tensor strength .",
    "the corresponding values are shown in fig .",
    "3 ( red dashed line ) . one can observe that , without the n ",
    "p tensor contribution , the values are similar but the trend is the opposite , that is , the gap is reduced when passing from @xmath4fe to @xmath0ca .",
    "the tensor force changes this trend . to isolate all the tensor contributions ,",
    "we have repeated the same calculations by quenching also the parameter responsible for the like  particle tensor effect .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in the figure by a green dot - dashed line .",
    "it is clear that the like  particle tensor contribution provides an enhancement of the gap but the change of trend is due only to the n ",
    "p contribution .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the present results with the values obtained with the original sly5 force ( blue dotted line in fig .",
    "3 ) . we can see that the trend is very similar to that obtained in our case by switching off the n ",
    "p tensor strength or both tensor strengths .",
    "there is however a shift of the values : the results obtained with the original parametrization are located between the green dot  dashed and the red dashed curves .",
    "the effect of the reduction of the spin ",
    "orbit induces the shift from the dotted to the dot  dashed curve and the inclusion of the like  particle tensor strength strongly pushes the values upwards . finally , the inclusion of the n ",
    "p tensor contribution determines the change of slope and provides increasing ( instead of decreasing ) gaps going from @xmath4fe to @xmath0ca .",
    "this is what expected following the arguments based on shell  model calculations and presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where this analysis is done for @xmath3 isotones .",
    "calculated for the isotones @xmath0ca , @xmath1ti , @xmath13cr , and @xmath4fe.,width=302 ]     and of the neutron states @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the isotones @xmath0ca , @xmath1ti , @xmath13cr , and @xmath4fe .",
    ", width=302 ]    we repeat the same analysis for @xmath3 isotones for the nuclei @xmath1ca , @xmath13ti , @xmath4cr , and @xmath5fe .",
    "the results are plotted in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "the difference with respect to the previous case is that the last occupied neutron state is now the state @xmath30 and the neutron gap @xmath3 is calculated between the states @xmath31 and @xmath30 .",
    "now , the n ",
    "p tensor effect associated to the proton state @xmath27 induces for both neutron states an attractive interaction , stronger for the @xmath10 state than for the @xmath34 state .",
    "this means that the gap is expected also in this case to be reduced in a given nucleus owing to the n ",
    "p tensor contribution .",
    "again , when this contribution is weakened going from @xmath5fe to @xmath1ca , the gap is eventually expected to increase .",
    "this effect may be seen in fig .",
    "5 ( black solid line ) . in fig .",
    "6 the involved neutron and proton single  particle energies are represented .",
    "again , the global mean  field evolution provides a reduction of the proton energy and an enhancement of the neutron energies , when going towards more neutron ",
    "rich nuclei along the isotonic chain . on top of this general effect ,",
    "the tensor effect has to be disentangled .",
    "this is done by plotting in fig .",
    "5 the results obtained by switching off the n  p tensor strength ( red dashed line ) .",
    "the gap still increases , but much less strongly than in the full calculations . by switching off",
    "also the like  particle tensor strength , the obtained values are reported by a green dot - dashed line .",
    "the value for the nucleus @xmath5fe is not reported .",
    "the hartree ",
    "fock calculation does not converge in this case .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the neutron states @xmath30 and @xmath31 become almost degenerate and cross each other at each iteration .",
    "the values obtained with the original sly5 force are also presented ( blue dotted line ) . also this time",
    "one observes that the slope in the results obtained with the original sly5 force is very similar to that obtained by switching off , in our case , the n ",
    "p tensor strength or both tensor strenghts .",
    "also in this case there is a shift between the dotted curve and the dashed and dot  dashed curves .",
    "the spin  orbit reduction in the new parametrization determines the shift to lower values from the dotted to the dot  dashed curve .",
    "the inclusion of the like  particle tensor contribution induces a strong shift to higher energies ( dashed curve ) . finally , the inclusion of the n ",
    "p tensor contribution leads to a change of slope ( solid curve ) .",
    "we notice that this time , even without the inclusion of the n ",
    "p tensor contribution , the mean  field calculations provide an enhancement of the gap when going from @xmath5fe to @xmath1ca .",
    "the tensor force leads however to a much stronger effect , affecting significantly the slope .    as was mentioned in sec .",
    "i , the calculations are done in spherical symmetry and the effect of possible deformations is thus neglected .",
    "the inclusion of possible small deformations for some @xmath2 and @xmath3 isotones would probably modify quantitatively our predictions but we do not expect that the qualitative trends and the general conclusions of this work would be changed : the tensor force would always shift in the same direction the single  particle energies ; the qualitative evolution of the corresponding gaps would not be expected to be stronlgy modified .",
    "calculated for the isotones @xmath1ca , @xmath13ti , @xmath4cr , and @xmath5fe .",
    ", width=302 ]     and of the neutron states @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the istones @xmath1ca , @xmath13ti , @xmath4cr , and @xmath5fe.,width=302 ]",
    "it was stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the new sets may induce non negligeable effects on the masses of some nuclei , because the spin ",
    "orbit strength was modified without refitting also the other parameters of the force .",
    "we have thus checked whether the values of the masses predicted for the ca isotopes under study are reasonable with the new parametrization .",
    "we have found the following binding energies : 343.83 , 415.91 , 438.62 , and 445.21 mev for the nuclei @xmath11ca , @xmath12ca , @xmath0ca , and @xmath1c , respectively .",
    "these values have to be compared with the binding energies obtained with the original sly5 force , that are 344.07 , 415.92 , 437.25 , and 444.94 mev for @xmath11ca , @xmath12ca , @xmath0ca , and @xmath1c , respectively .",
    "we observe that the deviations are not very important .",
    "the largest deviation between the new skyrme values and those obtained with sly5 is 0.3% .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the two  neutron separation energies are compared with several theoretical models .",
    "experimentally , a clear signature of shell closure for the nucleus @xmath0ca is the important reduction of the @xmath8 value going from @xmath0ca to @xmath1ca .",
    "this new experimental value is now available owing to the high  precision mass measurement of @xmath1ca reported in ref .",
    "@xcite : going from @xmath22ca to @xmath0ca , the value of @xmath8 remains almost the same , and it has a sudden decrease from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "several edf results are reported in fig .",
    "3(b ) of ref .",
    "it is commented there that , in general , these models do not provide the correct trend for the @xmath8 energies going from @xmath37 to @xmath36 : they predict a very smooth ( almost linear ) change in the @xmath8 values .",
    "we have thus computed the two  neutron separation energies @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the binding energy of the nucleus @xmath40 , and compared them with the experimental values for the isotopes @xmath22ca , @xmath0ca , and @xmath1ca .",
    "this is shown in fig . 7",
    "where also the experimental values ( including those of ref .",
    "@xcite and the new data of ref .",
    "@xcite ) are presented .",
    "ca , @xmath0ca , and @xmath1ca calculated with the new skyrme set .",
    "the experimental values are reported @xcite .",
    "the theoretical value for the nucleus @xmath13ca is also shown . in the inset",
    "the difference between the theoretical and the experimental values is displayed.,width=302 ]    we observe that the agreement with the experimental values is quite good and that the predicted change with respect to @xmath41 is not linear .",
    "the good agreement can also be seen in the inset of the figure , where the differences between the theoretical and the experimental values of @xmath8 are reported .",
    "we have to mention that the correct trend for the @xmath8 values may be found also by using the original sly5 force , without including the tensor term . however , the signatures of magicity are slightly stronger with the present set of parameters . with the present modified sly5 ,",
    "the so  called two  neutron shell gap , calculated as @xmath42 , is equal to 5.1 mev for @xmath0ca , to be compared with an experimental value of almost 4 mev @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath8 value , found going from @xmath36 to @xmath43 , can not be compared with any experimental result because the mass of the nucleus @xmath13ca was not yet measured experimentally .",
    "the experimental @xmath8 value is thus still unknown at @xmath43 .",
    "however , our theoretical prediction , that leads to a quite significant reduction from @xmath36 to @xmath43 , is coherent with the new spectroscopic data of ref .",
    "@xcite , that indicate a magic nature for the nucleus @xmath1ca .",
    "one should mention however that the inclusion of possible pairing correlations in the nucleus @xmath13ca would render this system more bound and would thus provide a higher value of @xmath8 at @xmath43 .",
    "we can conclude that the present edf results display the correct trend for the values of @xmath8 in the region from @xmath22ca to @xmath1ca ( weak change from @xmath37 to @xmath35 and significant change from @xmath35 to @xmath36 ) .",
    "in this work , we have examined some shell effects that may be clearly related to the contributions induced by a tensor force within the mean  field framework with the skyrme interaction .",
    "the employed tensor force is of zero range .",
    "we use one parametrization that was introduced in a previous work @xcite on top of the skyrme sly5 force @xcite . in this parameter set , the spin ",
    "orbit strength was adjusted together with the tensor parameters . with this parameter set ,",
    "we have performed hartree  fock calculations in spherical symmetry .",
    "we are aware that many effects are disregarded by using this simple theoretical model , but our objective is to isolate the genuine effects coming from the inclusion of the tensor force in a mean  field model .",
    "the magicity of the two ca isotopes @xmath0ca and @xmath1ca has been confirmed by two recent experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "we have shown here that the introduction of the tensor force leads to an enhancement of magicity in the two isotopes . by analyzing ca isotopes",
    ", it is shown that the like  particle tensor contribution renders these nuclei more magic than they would be predicted by neglecting it . by studying @xmath2 and @xmath3 isotones , the neutron ",
    "proton tensor effects are identified and isolated with respect to the effects coming from the like  particle tensor contribution .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 neutron gaps are predicted to increase along isotonic chains , going from @xmath4fe to @xmath0ca , and from @xmath5fe to @xmath1ca , respectively . in the case",
    "@xmath2 , the n ",
    "p tensor contribution is responsible for the increasing trend ( without this contribution , the gap decreases ) . in the case",
    "@xmath3 , the gap increases even without the n ",
    "p tensor contribution , but the n ",
    "p tensor contribution determines an important change of the slope .",
    "a check on the masses of the ca isotopes under study is performed and the two  neutron separation energies are compared with the experimental data for @xmath22ca , @xmath0ca , and @xmath1ca . a good agreement is found : from @xmath37 to @xmath35 , the @xmath8 value does not change strongly , whereas it is significantly reduced from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "this provides an evidence for the shell closure @xmath2 in ca isotopes .",
    "the application described in this work confirms the robustness of the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite about the signs and the values for the tensor parameters .",
    "the employed parameter set , even if introduced with a partial adjustment of the parameters ( the other parameters of the forces are not modified , with the exception of the spin  orbit strength ) , provides the correct expected shell effects .",
    "different signs of the tensor parameters would generate un uncorrect behavior if compared with the experimental results .",
    "the present tensor parametrization ( and its induced like  particle and neutron  proton effects ) allows us in particular to describe , within a simple mean  field picture , the magicity of the ca isotopes @xmath0ca and @xmath1ca .",
