    "many chemical evolution models have been recently made to explain the chemical composition of the solar vicinity ( e.g. henry , edmunds , & kppen 2000 , liang , zhao & shi 2001 , chiappini , matteucci & meynet 2003a , chiappini , romano , & matteucci 2003b , akerman et al .",
    "in addition a few models have been computed to explain the behavior of c / o as a function of the distance to the galactic center ( e.g. hou , prantzos , & boissier 2000 , carigi 2003 , chiappini et al .",
    "2003b , gaviln , buell , & moll 2005 ) . in this paper the word gradient of an abundance ratio will be used to denote the galactocentric slope and the absolute value in the solar vicinity .",
    "most of the galactic chemical evolution models predict a similar history for c / o versus o / h at the solar vicinity , but make different predictions for the behavior of c / o at different galactocentric distances .",
    "all authors agree that both massive stars ( ms ) and low and intermediate mass stars ( lims ) play a significant role in the c production of the solar vicinity , nevertheless some authors find that most of the c is due to ms ( e.g. carigi 2000 , 2003 ; henry et al .",
    "2000 ) while other authors find that most of the c is due to lims ( e.g. chiappini et al .",
    "the different predictions on : the c / h value in the solar vicinity , the galactic c / o gradient , and the relative importance of ms and lims in the c production are mainly due to the stellar chemical evolution models obtained with different c yields . to discriminate among the sets of yields we need additional observational constraints to those used before .",
    "the c / h and o / h values derived from  regions at different galactocentric distances by esteban et al .",
    "( 2004a , hereinafter paper i ) , provide us with the additional constraints necessary to study this problem .",
    "in this paper we present eleven different chemical evolution models for the galaxy , based on combinations of eight different stellar yields , to try to fit the observed c / o gradient .",
    "it is difficult to study the c enrichment of the galaxy because c is produced by ms and lims and the evolution of both types of objects depends on : stellar winds , the convection treatment , and the @xmath0c(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3o rate , and an exact treatment of these three ingredients of the models is not yet available ( e.g. el eid et al .",
    "2004 , herwig & austin 2004 ) . due to these reasons",
    "many different estimates of the c yields for ms and lims are available in the literature .",
    "we have called  the c enrichment problem \" the difficulty of estimating the proper c yields for ms and lims . in this paper",
    "we explore different solutions to the c problem studying only the effect of the stellar winds on the value of c yields .",
    "it is even more difficult to study the n enrichment of the galaxy for the following reasons : it is produced by lims and ms , it can have a primary or secondary origin , and in general its abundance is considerably smaller than that of c and o. this last point implies that an uncertainty in the secondary production of n will affect considerably more the n abundances than the c and o abundances .",
    "consequently on theoretical grounds the predicted o and c values are more robust than the n values . from observations of  regions",
    "the abundances of c and o are of higher quality than those of n for the following reasons : for o we observe all the stages of ionization , for carbon we observe only the c@xmath4 fraction and an ionization correction factor , icf , is needed to correct for the unseen ions , fortunately for c the icf is small . on the other hand for n we observe only the n@xmath5 fraction which in general is not the most abundant ion , and consequently large icfs are needed to obtain the total n abundance .",
    "moreover the c and o abundances used in this paper are based on recombination lines that are almost independent of the temperature structure of the  regions , while the n@xmath5 abundances are based on collisionally excited lines that do depend on the temperature structure of the nebulae . to reach agreement between the different n / h observational data as well as between the observations and the predicted n / h values",
    "will be called  the nitrogen enrichment problem \" .",
    "we will use also the c / fe , n / fe , o / fe versus fe / h enrichment histories that provide us with additional checks to the models presented in this paper .",
    "our models will be compared with unevolved f and g stars and galactic  regions . in this work the data used",

    "the total nitrogen abundances were obtained based on the icf values derived from the models by mathis & rosa ( 1991 ) , note that these icf values yield n abundances about 0.11 dex higher than those derived from the usual formulation by peimbert and costero ( 1969 ) where it is assumed that n@xmath10/o@xmath10 is equal to n / o .    in figure 1",

    "this fraction is needed to explain the metallicity distribution of local g and k dwarf stars .",
    "for each set of yields , linear interpolations for different stellar masses and metallicities were made . for metallicities higher or lower than those available we adopted the yields predicted by the highest or lowest @xmath52 available , respectively .",

    "5 to 8 the ms mm02 yields with @xmath42 have winds with lower mass loss rates than those by m92 , producing a smaller amount of c. for model 9 the c / o gradient is almost flat because the ms pcb98 yields with @xmath64 include intense winds , which occur before these stars synthesize c ; therefore , their c yields become similar to those without stellar winds ( carigi , 2000 ) . for models 10 and 11",
    "the ms ww95 yields do not include stellar winds and consequently the c yields do not depend on @xmath52 .",
    "\\v ) the low c / o values predicted by models 4 and 8 are mainly due to the mm02 yields for lims , the lowest ones considered in this paper , because the mm02 yields did not extend to the thermal - pulse agb phase , consequently the third dredge - up and the hot - bottom burning stages were not included .",
    "moreover , the computations based on the mm02 yields for lims are somewhat uncertain because the only yields available are from 2  to 7  for @xmath65 , and for 3  in for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "\\vi ) models 2 and 6 , with vdhg.const yields , predict higher c / o values than models 3 and 7 , with vdhg.var yields , because the vdhg.const yields are computed with @xmath53 while vdhg.var yields are computed with @xmath51 between 1 and 4 . with higher @xmath51 values",
    "the stars lose more gas and the agb lifetimes become shorter , reducing the c yields .",
    "\\vii ) the highest c / o values with the same ms yields were predicted by models 1 and 5 , because the yields by mbcp for lims were computed with @xmath51 values lower than those assumed by vdhg .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    "the c enrichment is complex and depends on many variables .",
    "therefore , we decided to evaluate the relative importance of ms and lims in the production of c and to compute the fraction of c in the ism due to both types of stars . in table 3 , we present the c processed and ejected to the ism by ms , lims and type ia sne during the whole evolution of the solar vicinity . from this table",
    "it can be noted that : a ) models 1 and 2 , that are the two models that best fit the data , predict that ms produce between 48 % and 50 % and lims produce between 50 % and 47 % of the ism present - day carbon abundance , b ) the unsuccessful models predict that the c produced by ms varies from 36 % to 75 % and the c produced by lims varies from 62 % to 26 % , c ) the rest of the c is produced by type ia sne .",
    "the relative importance of the c production of ms and lims changes with time ( akerman et al . 2004 ) and with galactocentric radius .",
    "in figure 2 we present the cumulative c enrichment of the ism of the solar vicinity as a function of time and o / h for models 1 and 2 .",
    "as can be seen from the figure ms dominate the c enrichment at early times , 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath66 . for latter times ,",
    "12 + log(o / h ) @xmath67 , the contributions by ms and lims become comparable . at 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath68 the contribution of lims to the c enrichment increases because the lims formed in the halo end their evolution ejecting freshly made c , note that the low @xmath52 lims eject more c than the high @xmath52 ones . for 12 + log(o / h )",
    "@xmath69 the relative decrease in c production by lims is due to the higher contribution of the high @xmath52 ms to the c production , and the lower contribution of the high @xmath52 lims .    in table 4",
    "we present the fraction of c due to ms and lims in the ism for models 1 and 2 at different galactocentric distances . as expected , the fraction of c present in the ism produced by ms increases with decreasing @xmath21 ( for higher o / h values ) , because for ms the c yields increase with @xmath52 , while for lims they decrease with @xmath52 .    to make a detailed comparison with the observed abundances we present in table 5 the c / h and o / h predicted values by models 1 and 2 for the ism at the time the sun was formed ( 4.57 gyr ago ) and at the present time .    in the left panel of figure 3 we show the c / o versus o / h enrichment history for the solar vicinity predicted by models 1 and 2 . also in this figure we present three types of observations : a ) stellar values that are well fitted by models 1 and 2 with the exception of those objects c / o @xmath70 dex , b ) values for the two closest  regions in galactocentric distance to the solar vicinity , orion and ngc 3576 , that are perfectly fitted by model 1 and 2 , c ) the solar values that are",

    "we show the fit of models 1 and 2 to the data presented in paper i. all the models were constructed to reproduce the o / h values derived from  regions , but models 1 and 2 also produce an excellent fit to the c / h  region values and a good fit to the c / o gradient , while the other models do not .",
    "note that for galactocentric distances smaller than 6 kpc the c / o values predicted by the models start to saturate .",
    "additional observational data as well as a model that includes the behavior of the bulge are needed to study the regions with @xmath71 4 kpc . for galactocentric distances , larger than 11 kpc ,",
    "the c / o ratio predicted by models 1 and 2 flattens and again additional observations are needed to test the models .",
    "the fit to the observations corresponds to the @xmath72 range , therefore models 1 and 2 need to be tested for @xmath73 kpc and @xmath74 kpc based on future observations .      to constrain further the models of chemical evolution of the galaxy and to try to discriminate between models 1 and 2 we decided to study the enrichment of nitrogen during the history of the galaxy .    in models 1 and 2 , for @xmath52 = , we have assumed n yields from mm02 , computed with rotation and stellar winds ; while for c and o we have used yields from m92 , computed with stellar winds with a higher mass loss rate than those by mm02 .",
    "the effects of stellar winds are very important for the c and o yields , but not for the n yields ; while the effects due to rotation are more important for the n yields than for the c and o yields .    in figure 4 we present the cumulative n enrichment of the ism of the solar vicinity as a function of time and o / h for models 1 and 2 . as can be seen from the figure ms dominate the n enrichment at very early times , 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath75 . for latter times ,",
    "12 + log(o / h ) @xmath76 , the contributions lims become more important .",
    "the percentage of n by ms increases with 12 + log(o / h ) higher than 8.1 due to the increasing importance of secondary production in ms with increasing o / h .    in table 6",
    "we present the fraction of n due to ms and lims in the ism for models 1 and 2 at different galactocentric distances .",
    "as expected , the fraction of n present in the ism produced by ms increases with decreasing @xmath21 ( for higher o / h values ) , but in the computed range never produce a higher fraction of n than lims .",

( 2004 ) , that present n / h and o / h values , in figure 6 out of the four stars we present only two of them : hd 140283 and hd 194598 , we have an n / c value and two o / h values for each and therefore are plotted twice , the other two stars are not plotted because one of them only has an upper limit for the n / h value and the other is n rich and falls outside the figure , the observations fall between models 1 and 2 but are closer to model 2 , b ) values for orion and ngc 3576 that are perfectly fitted by model 1 , c ) the solar values that are intermediate between models 1 and 2 , and that show an n / c excess relative to  regions of about 0.2 dex , and d ) values for metal rich stars that appear to be better adjusted by model 2 , but that show n / c values from 0.1 to 0.6 dex higher than the n / c values determined for orion and ngc 3576 .    in the right panels of figure 6 we show the present behavior of n / c for the disk of the galaxy predicted by models 1 and 2 .",

    "our gradient implies lower o / h values for the inner regions of our galaxy which is consistent with recent suggestions that indicate that the o abundances of regions in the inner zones of external spiral galaxies are lower than previously thought ( bresolin , garnett , & kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "the slope of the o / h gradient presented in paper i is in excellent agreement with that by deharveng et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that amounts to @xmath81 dex kpc@xmath9 , but our o / h ratio for the ism of the solar vicinity amounts to 12 + log o / h = 8.77 , a value 0.29 dex higher than the 8.48 value derived by them . the lower o / h value by deharveng et al .",
    "is due to their adoption of @xmath11 = 0.00 that reduces the o / h value by 0.21 dex relative to the recombination line abundances and to the fraction of o trapped by dust grains that produces a further reduction of 0.08 dex .",
    "the similar slope between both groups is probably due to the similar @xmath11 values for galactic   regions at different galactocentric distances that amount to about 0.035 ( see paper i and table 2 ) .",
    "a similar situation to that by deharveng et al .",
    "( 2000 ) prevails with the o / h gradient by pilyugin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) that present a compilation of 71 observations of 13 galactic  regions by many authors and derive a slope for the gradient of @xmath82 dex kpc@xmath9 and a 12 + log o / h = 8.50 value for the solar vicinity .",
    "the slope of the gradient is in good agreement with that by deharveng et al . and",
    "that presented in paper i. but their o / h value is 0.27 dex smaller than that obtained by us , again due to their adoption of @xmath11 = 0.00 and the fraction of o trapped by dust grains not included by them .",
    "the n / h   region values used by us are typically 0.3 dex higher than those used by other authors .",
    "the differences with most authors are due to the adoption by us of @xmath83 that yield on average an increase of about 0.2 dex in the n / h values relative to those derived under the assumption that @xmath11 = 0.00 ; an additional increase of about 0.1 dex comes from the adoption of the icfs by mathis & rosa ( 1991 ) that in general are about 0.1 dex higher than those derived under the assumption that n@xmath10/o@xmath10 = n / o .",
    "even higher n / h values for the   regions are needed to reach agreement with the stellar values .",
    "we consider unlikely that a systematic difference in the adopted @xmath11 and icf values are responsible for the discrepancies between  regions and stellar values .",
    "the discussion of the n enrichment based on observations alone has an initial problem that has not been solved , namely that  regions yield n / o and n / c values that in general are considerably smaller than those of metal rich unevolved dwarfs of the solar vicinity ; the average difference amounts to 0.2 dex for n / o and to 0.3 dex for n / c . furthermore the dispersions among the stellar data amounts to 0.6 dex for n / o and 0.5 dex for n / c while for the  regions the dispersions amount to 0.2 dex in n / o and 0.3 dex in n / c ( see figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "part of the dispersion of the n / o values from  regions is due to the presence of an n / o gradient , on the other hand most of the dispersion in the n / o and n / c stellar data is not expected to be due to the dispersion of the ism abundances at the time these stars were formed because the spreads in age and galactocentric distances are relative small .",
    "the n / o and n / c differences between the metal rich stars and the  regions need to be sorted out before an agreement between the chemical enrichment history of the galaxy and the observations can be claimed .",
    "a possible solution to the n differences between metal rich stars and  regions could be due to a conversion of a small fraction of c into n after the stars were formed .",
    "this effect , if present , would help to explain not only the large observational dispersion observed but also the larger n / h values in these stars than in   regions .",
    "the fraction of c transformed into n needs to be small enough to avoid a substantial decrease in the c / h ratio , since this ratio is well explained by the galactic chemical evolution models .",

    "the behavior of model 1 for the halo is similar to that by akerman et al .",

    "( 2004 ) the minimum c / o value given by the halo objects has not been fitted by previous models nor by the models presented in this paper .",
    "there has been a discussion in the literature on the relative importance of ms and lims in the c production by different authors . while henry , edmunds , & kppen ( 2000 ) find that ms produce most of the c in the solar vicinity , we find that ms and lims produce roughly the same fraction .",

    "the other stars have on average values about 0.3 dex higher than those predicted by models 1 and 2",
    ". probably part of the discrepancy is due to difference in the assumptions made in the solar determination by asplund et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and those assumptions made in the determinations for other stars .",
    "it is possible to lower the fe production predicted by models 1 and 2 , without affecting the c / o versus o / h history , either by the reducing the fraction of the stars that produce type ia sne or by adopting the fe b yields by ww95 for type ii sne . in this case",
    "the models will produce a better fit to the c / fe and o / fe versus fe / h diagrams for the stars of the solar vicinity , but the predicted solar c / fe and o / fe values would become higher than the observed ones .",
    "that is , either the sun is c / fe and o / fe poor relative to the other stars , or the c / fe and o / fe abundances determinations for the solar vicinity stars present systematic effects relative to the solar determinations by asplund et al .",
    ".    some of our results might apply to other galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , we like to point out that the star formation history for other galaxies might be different to that of the galaxy and that tailor made models for representative galaxies are needed to see if our results can be generalized to other objects .",
    "the results presented previously depend on the imf adopted . therefore to study the effect of a different imf we decided to run chemical evolution models with a modified imf for @xmath102 .",
    "for @xmath102 the ktg imf shows a very similar slope than that presented by scalo ( 1986 , with @xmath103 ) and a steeper slope than that presented by salpeter ( 1955 , with @xmath104 ) .",

    "moreover the predicted gas mass ( 18 @xmath28 ) is higher than the observed one ( 13 @xmath109 @xmath28 ) . in order to improve the match",
    ", we computed several models reducing the upper limit masses of the imf down to 40 .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath110 are 12 + log(c / h)@xmath111 and 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath112 for solar values and 8.81 and 8.94 for the present time ism values , these values are still considerably higher than the observed ones . moreover",
    "the predicted gas mass ( 17 @xmath28 ) is still higher than the observed one .",
    "similarly all models based on a salpeter like imf with reasonable @xmath106 values ( @xmath113 ) fail also to reproduce the behavior of the c / o vs o / h enrichment history and the observed gradients simultaneously .    for @xmath110 the predicted and observed slopes of the c / h gradients are similar , but the predicted slope of the o / h gradient is steeper , and the predicted slope of the c / o gradient is flatter than the observed ones .",
    "the results of this section imply that the observational constraints are strong enough to permit to discriminate among different imfs . in a future paper",
    "we plan to use different imfs to study exhaustively their effects on the chemical evolution of the solar vicinity and the galactic disk .",
    "we present a set of 11 models built to reproduce the observed o / h gradient including the present solar vicinity o / h value of the ism .",

    "fe / h enrichment history models 1 and 2 differ considerably and the stellar data fall in between .",
    "model 2 is closer to the solar value than model 1 .",
    "there is an observational discrepancy between the n / c and n / o values derived from  regions and those derived from metal - rich stars of the solar vicinity that has to be sorted out before definitive conclusions of the galactic n enrichment history are reached .",
    "while model 1 produces an excellent agreement with the n / c and n / o values derived from observations of  regions and with the n / o values derived from metal poor stars , model 1 is not able to produce a good fit for the n / o values derived from metal rich stars .",
    "alternatively model 2 produces a fair fit to the n / c and n / o values derived from metal rich stars , but fails to explain the  region observations as well as those of metal poor stars .",
    "consequently the n enrichment problem has to be studied further .",
    "a more precise discussion of the n enrichment history requires a solution of the observational discrepancy in the n / c and n / o values between the  regions and the metal rich stars , as well as a revision of the n yields available .",
    "models 1 and 2 predict an enrichment in the o / h ratio of 0.13 dex since the sun was formed . by adding this value to the asplund et al .",

    "from the values presented in table 5 and figure 3 , it is clear that model 1 produces a better fit to the  region restrictions , to the solar values , and to the c / o versus o / h enrichment history than model 2 .",
    "in this paper we present a solution to the c enrichment history of the galaxy based on the yields and observations available .",
    "the solution is based on the adoption of c yields that increase with metallicity due to stellar winds in ms and decrease with metallicity due to stellar winds in lims .",
    "these yields fit the behavior of the c / o ratio in the @xmath72 range , the range for which we have c / h and o / h values from  regions based on recombination lines .",
    "the adopted yields also produce a reasonable fit to the c / o history of the solar vicinity .",
    "we also find that about half of the c in the ism of the solar vicinity at the present time has been produced by ms and half by lims .",
    "also , at the present time , for a galactocentric distance of 6 kpc about 53 % of the c has been produced by ms and 45 % by lims , while for 11 kpc the opposite is true , about 42 % of the c has been produced by ms and 56 % by lims .",
    "it is clear that a more powerful treatment of convection , a better value of the @xmath0c(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3o rate , and a more realistic mass loss rate scheme will produce a better solution to the c enrichment problem .",
    "moreover to produce a more stringent test for the c yields it is necessary to obtain observations of the c / o ratio for @xmath114 kpc and @xmath115 kpc and to include a model of the bulge formation and its effect on the c / o values for the inner regions of the galaxy .",

    "<S> all the models fit the oxygen gradient , but only two models fit also the carbon gradient , those based on carbon yields that increase with metallicity due to stellar winds in massive stars ( ms ) and decrease with metallicity due to stellar winds in low and intermediate mass stars ( lims ) </S>",
    "<S> . the successful models also fit the c / o versus o / h evolution history of the solar vicinity obtained from stellar observations . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the present day n / h gradient and the n / o versus o / h and the c / fe , n / fe , o / fe versus fe / h evolution histories of the solar vicinity predicted by our two best models with those derived from  regions and from stellar observations . </S>",
    "<S> while our two best models fit the c / h and o / h gradients as well as the c / o versus o / h history , only model 1 fits well the n / h gradient and the n / o values for metal poor stars but fails to fit the n / h values for metal rich stars . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we conclude that our two best models solve the c enrichment problem , but that further work needs to be done on the n enrichment problem . by adding the c and o production since the sun was formed predicted by models 1 and 2 to the observed solar values we find an excellent agreement with the o / h and c / h values of the solar vicinity derived from  regions o and c recombination lines . </S>",
    "<S> our results are based on an imf steeper than salpeter s , a salpeter like imf predicts c / h , n / h , and o / h ratios higher than observed . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important results of this paper is that the fraction of carbon due to ms and lims in the interstellar medium is strongly dependent on time and on the galactocentric distance ; at present about half of the carbon in the interstellar medium of the solar vicinity has been produced by ms and half by lims . </S>"
