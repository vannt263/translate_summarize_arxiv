    "granular materials consist of macroscopic dissipative particles . in some cases the granular material behaves as an unusual fluid .",
    "although to understand the rheology of the granular fluid is practically important , our understanding on the rheology is not enough .",
    "there are several reasons to have poor understanding on the rheology of granular flows : ( i ) the separation of the length scale between particles and the fluid motion is not enough , ( ii ) there are some cases that the fluid region coexists with the solid - like region , and ( iii ) most of experiments are strongly affected by boundary conditions and the external field .",
    "nevertheless , it is believed that rapid granular flows for relatively dilute granular gases can be described by a set of hydrodynamic equations at navier - stokes order whose transport coefficients can be calculated by the kinetic theory.@xcite    to maintain a granular gas we need to add an external field .",
    "the simplest steady situation of the granular fluid is achieved by the balance between an external shear and inelastic collisions between particles .",
    "this system is appropriate to investigate what the constitutive equation for the granular fluid is .",
    "the kinetic theory may suggest that the stress - strain relation can be described by that at navier - stokes order , though the transport coefficients can be functions of the position.@xcite    about 50 years ago , bagnold@xcite suggested that the granular fluid is characterized by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the shear stress and the shear rate ( the strain ) , respectively .",
    "this stress - stain relation is known as bagnold s scaling and is different from the conventional newtonian relation which is @xmath3 .",
    "recently , pouliquen@xcite and silbert _",
    "et al._@xcite have reconfirmed the quantitative relevancy of bagnold s scaling in granular flows on inclined slopes .",
    "mitarai and nakanishi@xcite have demonstrated that the kinetic theory can be compatible with bagnold s scaling , when they assume that the the temperature is a slaving variable of the velocity and the density .",
    "et al._@xcite also indicate that bagnold s scaling is valid for steady dilute granular gases without the influence of the gravity in the uniform shear flow ( usf ) , though the transport coefficients such as the viscosity and the heat conductivity are different from those in homogeneous cooling state@xcite . however , we still do not know whether bagnold s scaling is relevant in other situations .    we should recall that it is difficult to keep granular gases in experimentally relevant situations because of the existence of gravity . recently , to remove the effects of gravity , the rheology of dense granular flows under the plane shear with a constant pressure has been studied and a new scaling has been reported@xcite .",
    "these studies are important but particles are not in a gas state , _ i.e. _ each particle is in contact with many other particles simultaneously .",
    "the analysis of such process is challenging but we do not have any good tool to analyze it at present . here , we focus on the granular shear flows without multi - body contacts in a constant volume container to discuss quantitative relevancy of the kinetic theory .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to know the relevancy of the kinetic theory for a granular gas with moderate density under the plane shear in a constant volume container to characterize the rheology of granular fluids . for this purpose",
    ", we investigate whether ( i ) the kinetic theory is relevant for the relatively dense granular gas , and ( ii ) the tangential contact and the rotation of particles are irrelevant except for the boundary layers .",
    "it should be noted that bagnold s scaling is no more relevant for flows with non - uniform shear rate in the steady granular flow .",
    "in fact , to satisfy @xmath4 , the shear rate @xmath2 should be uniform , because the shear stress and the pressure are spatially uniform in the steady state . to investigate the above problem",
    ", we use the discrete element method ( dem ) for particles simulation in a plane shear problem of dense granular gases in which particles are confined in a constant volume box ( section ii ) .",
    "we adopt the constitutive equation of hydrodynamics derived by jenkins and richman@xcite for non - rotational particles in section iii . in section iv we solve a set of hydrodynamic equations with the above constitutive equation numerically and compare the result with the result of dem .",
    "we also check the renormalization theory of the restitution coefficient developed by yoon and jenkins@xcite . in section",
    "v we obtain the analytic solution of the steady hydrodynamic equations to verify the quantitative relevancy of the constitutive equation . in section vi we discuss our result and the relevancy of bagnold s scaling . in section vii , we conclude our results . in appendix",
    ", we briefly explain the method to determine the tangential restitution constant as a function of the incident angle .",
    "the discrete element method ( dem ) is one of the standard methods to simulate granular motions.@xcite dem is applicable to most of situations of granular dynamics even when particles are almost motionless and contact with many other particles .",
    "we adopt dem to simulate a granular fluid to check ( i ) the validity of kinetic theory based on the reliable model , and ( ii ) the effects of rotation of particles for the granular fluid .    in this paper , we focus on a two - dimensional motion of granular particles under a plane shear .",
    "we adopt the linear spring model for the repulsion with the normal stiffness @xmath5 and the tangential stiffness @xmath6 , and the normal and the tangential viscous coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "let us consider a colliding pair of two disks @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the diameter @xmath11 and the mass @xmath12 at the position @xmath13 with the velocity @xmath14 and the angular velocity @xmath15 for @xmath16 or @xmath10 .",

    "thus , the equation of motion of particle @xmath9 is described by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the moment of inertia .",
    "we integrate ( [ 2 - 3 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 4 ] ) in terms of the second order adams - bashforth with the time interval @xmath40 .    through the paper",
    "we adopt the following parameters as @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the shear speed at the boundary .",

    "as shown in appendix , the tangential restitution constant @xmath55 can be approximated by@xcite @xmath56 we also note that the realistic value of coulomb friction constant in both disks and spheres is @xmath57@xcite thus , the renormalization theory of the restitution constant may be applicable to many realistic situations .",
    "simulations of granular particles under the plane shear have been performed by many researchers , but many of them@xcite assume lees - edwards boundary condition@xcite which may not be adequate to consider the effects of physical boundary . on the other hand , babic@xcite , popken and cleary@xcite have simulated sheared granular flows confined in frictional flat boundaries , but their simulations are restricted to the cases for small systems and almost elastic particles . kim@xcite",
    "has indicated that the density of particles near the boundary is higher than that in the bulk region for his simulation of a small system with the flat frictional boundary , while particles are accumulated in the center region for a larger system .",
    "louge@xcite has simulated a three dimensional shear flow on the flat frictional boundary to examine the boundary condition proposed by jenkins@xcite , but louge is mainly interested in the behavior of flux , the stress ratio as the functions of volume fraction and the restitution constant .",
    "recent papers by xu _",
    "for an experiment@xcite and a simulation@xcite examine the validity of three dimensional kinetic theory by jenkins and richman@xcite under asymmetric shears in the presence of a streamwise body force , where they obtain reasonable agreements between the theory and the observations in both the experiment and the simulation .",
    "as long as our knowledge , we do not know papers to discuss the validity of kinetic theory in a transient dynamics and a symmetric shear without a streamwise body force with an enough large system .",
    "thus , we adopt the following setup of our dem simulation shown in fig.[fig:4 - 1 ] . the system is confined in a two - dimensional container . without including the effects of the air and the gravity we add a symmetric shear with the shear speed @xmath46 as shown in fig.[fig:4 - 1 ] .",

    "we introduce some fixed particles on the wall to reproduce the bumpy boundary .",
    "the reason why we adopt the bumpy boundary is to avoid the large amount of slips on the wall under a physical situation . in our simulation",

    "two shallow clusters appear near the wall , and move to the center region of the container .",
    "then , the two clusters merge to form a big cluster .",
    "a similar behavior can be observed in the simulation under the lees - edwards boundary condition.@xcite     and @xmath74 , respectively . , width=377 ]    the time evolution of the total kinetic energy @xmath75 in a typical situation is shown in fig.[fig:4 - 3 ] , where the energy is defined by @xmath76 in this figure , the initial energy is larger than the steady value , but we have checked that the qualitatively similar results can be obtained even when we start from the smaller energy about @xmath77 in the dimensionless unit .",
    "it is characteristics that the total kinetic energy is relaxed to be almost a constant value quickly , but there is the slow evolution of hydrodynamic fields .",
    "the hydrodynamic variables are the local area fraction @xmath78 with the number density @xmath79 , the velocity field @xmath80 and the granular temperature @xmath81 which is defined by @xmath82 in our simulation we divide the system into square cells with the linear dimension @xmath11 .",
    "then , we can check to what cell each particle belongs .",

    "the temparture field is also calculated by @xmath88     with ( a ) at @xmath89 and ( b ) at @xmath90 , where the units of the time and @xmath91 are @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively.,width=604 ]    the time evolution of hydrodynamic variables can be summarized as follows .",
    "corresponding to fig.2 , the local area fraction becomes large near the boundary at the initial stage , and the shallow clusters move to the central region of the container with growing the peak density .",
    "finally , the two clusters merge to form a compact cluster at the center @xmath94 .",
    "the interesting behavior can be observed in the velocity field and the granular temperature .",
    "the @xmath65-component of the velocity field is almost zero between two clusters during the time evolution , and such plug region is narrower as the distance of two clusters is closer . even in the steady state ,",
    "the velocity gradient in the central region is smaller than that near the boundary .",
    "the behavior of @xmath59-component of the dimensionless velocity field @xmath91 is also characteristic , because this quantity shows the tendency to move to the central region and is relaxed to be zero in the steady state ( fig.[fig:4 - 8 ] ) .",
    "similarly , the temperature field in the central region is smaller than that near the boundary .",
    "however , the minimum value of temperature decreases with time and reaches almost zero in the central region in the steady stage .",
    "the results of our dem simulation except for @xmath95 will be shown in sections iv and v through the comparison of dem with hydrodynamic simulations or the theoretical results in the steady state .",
    "the result of our simulation may give us suspicious impression of the validity of kinetic theory for this system , because ( i ) the density in the cluster is near the closest packing @xmath96 in the steady state , ( ii ) the particles are almost motionless in the clusters or between clusters .",
    "our result is contrast to the result by xu _",
    "et al._@xcite where there is no definite motionless clusters because of the existence of a streamwise body force . in their case ,",
    "the mean density is much higher than that in our case , and the temperature is a nearly constant . nevertheless ,",
    "as will be shown , our system can be described by the hydrodynamic equation derived from the kinetic theory .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to verify the validity of the granular hydrodynamic equation derived from the kinetic theory .",
    "although there are two standard methods , chapman - enskog method @xcite and grad expansions @xcite , most of established results are limited to low density cases in the derivation of hydrodynamic equations . however , as shown in the previous section , we have to adopt the kinetic theory for dense granular gases .",
    "the chapman - enskog method by graz and dufty@xcite and lutsko@xcite predicts transport coefficients in dense granular gases .",
    "on the other hand , jenkins and richman derive hydrodynamic equations based on grad expansion and give transport coefficients@xcite .",
    "although the treatment by jenkins and richman@xcite does not take into account the contraction of the phase space volume in each collision , the theory is suitable for our purpose because it gives us explicit expressions of the transport coefficients in the two - dimensional dense granular gases .",
    "jenkins and richman@xcite , and lun@xcite derive sets of hydrodynamic equations which include the angular velocity , the spin temperature as well as the density , the translational velocity and the granular temperature .",
    "the equations include the couple stress and the collisional loss of spin energy .",
    "these sets of hydrodynamic equations are categorized as the micropolar fluid mechanics which was originally proposed by cosserat and cosserat for the description of the elastic materials@xcite .",
    "application of the concept of micropolar fluid mechanics to atomic gases are developed by dahler and his coworkers@xcite .",
    "the micropolar fluid mechanics is applied to granular flows by kanatani@xcite , lun@xcite , babic@xcite , hayakawa@xcite and mitarai _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "the importance of the excitation of the spin on the boundary is indicated by jenkins@xcite , but the effects of the spin can be decoupled with the translational velocity in the bulk region . in particular , babic@xcite indicated that the coupled stress induced by the collisions between circular particles is canceled .",
    "therefore , we believe that the effect of spins can be absorbed in the boundary condition and the renormalized restitution constant .",
    "recently , jenkins and zhang@xcite have proposed a scheme of the renormalized restitution constant as the result of the absorption of the rotation of particles .",
    "yoon and jenkins@xcite have extend the scheme to two - dimensional flows as @xmath97 the validity of three dimensional theory@xcite has been tested by xu _",
    "et al._@xcite and jenkins and zhang@xcite .",
    "the latter is consistent with lun and bent@xcite in part .",
    "however , the quantitative validity of yoon and jenkins@xcite has not been confirmed yet .",
    "in addition , some recent papers suggest that the spin effects are relevant in granular flows . for instance , goldhirsch _ et al._@xcite have indicated that the equipartition between spin energy and the translational energy is violated in a recent paper , and gefen and alam@xcite discuss the linear stability of sheared micropolar fluid .",
    "therefore , we need to judge whether the concept of micropolar fluid is necessary for the description of granular fluids .    in this paper , we adopt the renormalization procedure of the restitution constant proposed by yoon and jenkins@xcite to verify the validity of their scheme .",
    "thus , the restitution constant @xmath98 appears in hydrodynamic equations is different from @xmath99 of dem , where the relation between two restitution constants is given in eq.([e_eff ] ) .",
    "namely , @xmath47 in dem corresponds to @xmath100 for @xmath45 in hydrodynamic equations .",

    "it is well established to solve the second order ordinary differential equation such as ( [ 2nd - eq ] ) . introducing @xmath201 as @xmath202 and the multiplying @xmath203 in both sides of ( [ 2nd - eq ] ) , and",
    "thus integrate the equation from @xmath94 to @xmath59 we obtain @xmath204 where we use the symmetric condition @xmath205 at @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath206 thus , we obtain the equation of @xmath59 as the function of @xmath178 .    to draw the actual profile of @xmath178 , we start from a trial @xmath207 to integrate ( [ steady - sol ] ) and calculate @xmath208 , where the suffix 1 represents the first trial function .",
    "then we replace @xmath207 by @xmath209 to reduce the deviation between @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "we repeat this relaxation procedure to obtain the converged result @xmath212 until @xmath213 th trial .",
    "once we obtain @xmath178 , we can determine @xmath179 and @xmath195 by eq.([du / dy - theta ] ) .",
    "the mean area fraction is @xmath61.,width=604 ]     ( c ) .",
    "here we use @xmath100 and the mean area fraction @xmath61.,width=604 ]    to compare @xmath178 and @xmath195 with the result of dem we use a fitting parameter @xmath199 , while we need two fitting parameters ( @xmath214 and @xmath215 for non - rotational cases and @xmath214 and @xmath216 for rotational cases ) to determine @xmath181 and @xmath179 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath196 and @xmath1 are determined by the boundary condition , but the boundary condition in eqs.([8.4 ] ) and ( [ 8.6 ] ) with ( [ 8.7 ] ) contains two undetermined parameters .",
    "thus , @xmath196 and @xmath1 can not be determined within our theory .",
    "figure [ fig:6 - 1 - 3 ] is the comparison of our theoretical result with the result of dem without the tangential contact force in the interaction between particles for @xmath61 .",
    "the agreement between the theory and dem is good .",
    "figure [ fig:6 - 4 - 6 ] is the comparison of our theoretical result with the result of dem including the tangential interaction taking into account the renormalization of the restitution constant for @xmath61 .",
    "we again obtain a fairly good agreement between the theory and the simulation .",
    "the reason why we can use the kinetic theory is that collisions between particles are almost binary even in the dense cluster . actually , we find that contacted particles are about 1.014 @xmath217 of all particles at an instance , and only 2.4 @xmath217 of contacts are multi - body contacts among all contacts for @xmath218 .",
    "therefore , the kinetic theory can be used even in the dense cluster in which particles are almost motionless .    in principle , we can measure both the normal stress and the shear stress from the data of dem . however , we only obtain the results with large errors .",
    "it seems that there is a tendency to have too small @xmath196 in the direct measurement , though observed @xmath1 is similar to the fitting value .",
    "thus , we confirm that ( i ) the kinetic theory by jenkins and richman@xcite can reproduce the profiles of hydrodynamic variables to describe the steady state of the granular fluid though the fitting values of the stresses are included , and ( ii ) the renormalization scheme proposed by yoon and jenkins@xcite is accurate . although the setup of our simulation seem to be similar to that by xu _",
    "et al_.@xcite , our result for hydrodynamic variables is much heterogeneous than that by xu _",
    "et al_. in the presence of a streamwise flow .",
    "in fact , our system is separated into two regions which are a compact cluster and the very dilute region .",
    "the particles within the cluster is motionless , but the particles in the dilute region have large kinetic energy . on the other hand , the steady state obtained by xu _",
    "et al_. is similar to usf .",
    "thus , the result strongly depends on whether there is a stream flow .",
    "let us discuss our results in this section . to clarify the points we discuss three important points ; the linear stability analysis of usf , the validity of the truncation at navier - stokes order and the effects of external fields .",
    "our analysis presented here suggests that usf of granular fluid is unstable . to verify such suggestion , we need to discuss the linear stability of usf .",
    "the stability of sheared granular flows has been discussed by many researchers.@xcite many of them assume that the granular fluid is confined in an infinitely large system , but alam _ et al._@xcite discuss the bifurcation of the steady solution as a function of the system size .",
    "we should note that the stability of granular flows on an inclined slope has also been discussed by some researchers.@xcite    here , we have also checked the linear stability of the uniform sheared state assuming lees - edwards sheared boundary condition . since the result is almost equivalent to that by alam and nott@xcite , we only summarize the outline of our linear stability analysis .",
    "our result indicates that usf is always unstable for enough large systems , but can be stable if the system size is enough small near @xmath118 .",
    "this result is consistent with the results by babic@xcite and popken and cleary@xcite .",
    "the details of our linear stability analysis will be reported elsewhere .",
    "as indicated in section i , bagnold s scaling can be used if the system is uniform and the heat conduction is negligible . however , the granular gas under the plane shear is not the case that we can assume bagnold s scaling .",
    "the heat conduction plays an important role and usf can not be maintained even when we adopt lees - edwards boundary condition .      in this paper",
    ", we use the set of hydrodynamic equations at navier - stokes order .",
    "it should be noted that the set of hydrodynamic equations at navier - stokes order does not mean newtonian .",
    "actually , our granular system exhibits non - newtonian behavior _",
    "i.e. _ non - uniform velocity gradient as in figs.9 ( c ) and 10(c ) in spite of the uniform shear stress in the steady state .    from our analysis ,",
    "the effects from the contraction of phase volume in collisions in the inelastic boltzmann - enskog equation are also small .",
    "the effects of tangential contact force and the rotation of particles are also not important in the bulk behavior of hydrodynamics .",
    "therefore , the kinetic theory by jenkins and richman@xcite gives us sufficient accurate results to describe the hydrodynamics .",
    "et al._@xcite and tij _ et al_.@xcite indicate that the transport coefficients in couette flow depend on the dimensionless shear rate .",
    "however , in our system the shear rate only determines the time scale and thus the qualitative behavior should not depend on the shear rate .",
    "there is room for discussion on the role of the shear rate in granular gases as an open problem .",
    "some persons suggest the relevant role of terms at burnett or super - burnett order terms@xcite , but our analysis indicate that the contribution from higher oder terms should be small . it is known that hydrodynamic equations at burnett order derived from the classical gas kinetics is unstable for perturbation , _",
    "i.e. _ some solutions will blow up when a perturbation is applied to the system.@xcite therefore , we may need to be careful to use hydrodynamic equations at burnett order or super - burnett order to describe granular fluids .",
    "our system does not contain the external force except for the driving force of the boundary plates . in physical situations , it is difficult to remove the effect of gravity and collisions among particles may not be regarded as binary . as indicated in introduction , recent papers and",
    "cited therein@xcite of sheared granular materials under a constant pressure produce a state of granular liquid in which particles are multiple contacts with each other .",
    "in these cases , the square root of stiffness of grains becomes a characteristic frequency .",
    "thus , the behavior should depend on the shear rate .",
    "if we are interested in jamming transition or related phenomena of granular materials , we need to apply an external field to the system",
    ". such subject will be important even in practical sense .",
    "in this paper , we have confirmed the validity of hydrodynamic equations derived from the kinetic theory by jenkins and richman.@xcite we also confirm the relevancy of the renormalization method of the restitution constant by yoon and jenkins.@xcite this result may be surprised because the system includes a dense cluster whose packing fraction is close to the maximum value , and the particles in the cluster are almost motionless . since usf is unstable , we can not use bagnold s scaling to characterize the granular fluid in this case .",
    "we thank n. mitarai and t. hatano for fruitful discussion and their variable comments .",
    "hh also thanks j. t. jenkins for his useful comments .",
    "this study is partially supported by the grants - in - aid of japan space forum , and ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , japan ( grant no . 15540393 and no . 18540371 ) and the grant - in - aid for the 21st century coe `` center for diversity and universality in physics '' from mext , japan .",
    "in this appendix , we demonstrate how to derive @xmath219 in walton s expression in eq.([walton])@xcite for the tangential restitution coefficient .",
    "although the theory by maw _ et al._@xcite has been used to evaluate @xmath55 , their expression is complicated and has an implicit form .",
    "therefore , an explicit expression for walton s @xmath219 and the critical angle @xmath53 is useful .    let us consider a collision between identical disks . following the notation in section ii",
    "( without suffices @xmath9 and @xmath10 for colliding particles ) , the equation of motion for the tangential direction is described by @xmath220 when there is no slip during the collision .",
    "the factor 2 appears because the reduced mass is the half of mass of each particle .",
    "the solution of eq.([3 - 14 ] ) is easily obtained as @xmath221 for @xmath222 , where @xmath223 .",
    "since we choose large @xmath6 and small @xmath8 , the relation @xmath222 should be satisfied .",
    "similarly , the equation of motion in the normal direction is also described by an equation for a dumped oscillation .",
    "thus , the duration time @xmath224 at which @xmath225 is satisfied and the normal restitution constant are respectively given by @xmath226 .\\ ] ] on the other hand , the restitution constant @xmath219 for the tangential contact is thus given by @xmath227 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath228 if we substitute the values @xmath229 , @xmath42 , @xmath230 and @xmath44 used in dem simulation , we obtain @xmath231 .",
