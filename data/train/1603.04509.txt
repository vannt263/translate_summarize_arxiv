    "the goal of quantum metrology is to obtain the most precise measurements possible with minimal resources  @xcite .",
    "many types of high - precision measurement use a form of interferometry . in interferometers ,",
    "the unknown parameter is imprinted as the relative phase between a superposition of states .",
    "measurement of the output state , after quantum interference , gives information about the unknown parameter .",
    "one particular example is optical interferometry with mach - zehnder interferometers . in this case , using @xmath0 independent photons gives @xmath1 scaling for the uncertainty of phase measurements , which is known as the standard quantum limit .",
    "however , using @xmath0 entangled photons gives @xmath2 scaling for the phase uncertainty , which is often called the heisenberg limit .",
    "this enhancement in sensitivity is of much importance in probing delicate systems such as atoms @xcite and biological samples .",
    "a well - known type of entangled states is noon states .",
    "noon states saturate the heisenberg limit .",
    "however , in the presence of absorption , noon states perform poorly and other states must be considered .",
    "even with such states , the advantage over the standard quantum limit is reduced by loss . however , we can take advantage of the sensitivity of nonclassical properties of quantum states to absorption",
    ". the sensitivity of quantum coherence can be used efficiently to estimate absorption @xcite , and also estimate physical quantities that the absorption depends on .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a sub - shot - noise measurement of absorption is obtained using heralded single photons . in that work , a non - interferometric setup was used , where all the information is obtained from absorption , and the quantum enhancement results from sub - poissonian statistics of single photons . according to the kramers - kronig relation , absorption is accompanied by a phase shift @xcite . however , the information from the phase is only accessible if we take advantage of superposition and interference .",
    "one would think , since noon states have coherence which is highly sensitive to loss , they could be the best candidates to sense loss or a parameter which causes loss in the system .",
    "however , here we show that for the task of spectroscopy , when there is an advantage to using entangled states , it is possible to find more general entangled states that perform better than noon states .",
    "the system we are considering here is an ensemble of atoms .",
    "we are interested in measuring a transition frequency of the atoms .",
    "if this ensemble is probed by a beam of photons , the absorption of photons , and phase shift imposed on the probe , both depend on the transition frequency of atoms .",
    "we consider a mach - zehnder interferometer with the atomic ensemble placed in one of the arms of the interferometer .",
    "we optimize over the state in the arms of the interferometer and find the state from which we obtain the maximum information about the atomic transition frequency .",
    "consider a mach - zehnder interferometer , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - intf ] , with an ensemble of atoms placed in the upper arm of the interferometer . here",
    ", we consider an ensemble of identical two - level atoms in the absence of doppler broadening and dipole dephasing .",
    "this simple model gives a good qualitative description of the problem .",
    "assuming that all atoms interact equally with the input quantum state and that there is no interaction between atoms , using the dipole and rotating - wave approximation the susceptibility of the ensemble is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the detuning between @xmath5 , the transition frequency of atoms , and @xmath6 , the frequency of input photons , @xmath7 is the spontaneous decay rate of the excited state , @xmath8 is the number density of atoms , @xmath9 is the electric dipole moment , @xmath10 is the reduced planck constant and @xmath11 is the vacuum permittivity .",
    "details of the derivation of this susceptibility based on interaction of an ensemble of atoms with quantized light are given in refs .  .",
    "the imaginary and real parts of the susceptibility are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - chi ] . in this figure",

    "normally , one beam splitter is used to model loss in each of the arms of a mach - zehnder interferometer @xcite . however ,",
    "here we consider a line of @xmath20 beam splitters , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - bsatom ] where each beam splitter represents one of the atoms in the ensemble .",
    "the @xmath21th beam splitter transforms the creation operator @xmath22 according to @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the transmissivity and reflectivity of the beam splitter , @xmath6 is the frequency of input photons , and @xmath26 is the loss mode of the @xmath21-th beam splitter .    the effect of the atomic ensemble is obtained by applying all the beam splitters , and taking the limit as the number of beam splitters approaches infinity . the creation operator of the input mode @xmath27 is therefore transformed to @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the length of the ensemble , @xmath6 is the frequency of the input photons , @xmath30 is the speed of light and @xmath19 is the imaginary part of the susceptibility of the atomic ensemble @xmath31 .",

    ", the transmissivity of the ensemble , @xmath35 , and the phase shift imposed on the state from the ensemble , @xmath33 , can be written in terms of the imaginary and real parts of the susceptibility @xmath36 here , we have used the approximation @xmath37 .",

    "however , in this region , @xmath35 is very small .    in the following section we find the optimal states to measure the transition frequency of the atoms i.e. ,  @xmath34 in this scheme .",
    "we consider the general form of the state in the arms of the interferometer to be @xmath40 i.e. ,  a pure state with the total photon number of @xmath0 .",
    "we use fisher information as the measure to quantify the metrological value of the states . according to the cramr - rao bound @xcite the variance in estimating a parameter , @xmath34 in this case",
    ", using an unbiased estimate , is lower bounded by the inverse of the fisher information @xmath41 @xmath42 here , we are considering photon number detection in the output modes , thus we are using classical rather than quantum fisher information .",
    "the fisher information represents the amount of information about @xmath34 contained in the measurement results .",
    "it is given as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the probability of detecting @xmath45 and @xmath46 photons in each of the output ports .",
    "considering the state given in eq .",

    "on the first mode , and the last 50/50 beam splitter of the interferometer on both modes , we obtain @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the frequency of the photons in the input state . because we are quantifying the metrological value of the states via the fisher information , we regard the optimal states to be those which maximize the fisher information .",
    "we have found the optimal values of @xmath49 numerically using the particle swarm optimization ( pso ) algorithm .    in the pso algorithm a swarm of particles",
    "search the space of @xmath49 coefficients for those that maximize the fisher information .",
    "each particle has a velocity @xmath50 and position @xmath51 which are updated to @xmath52 and @xmath53 according to its best previous position @xmath54 , and the best position of the entire swarm @xmath55 as @xcite @xmath56.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are uniform random numbers in the interval @xmath59 $ ] , and @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constants . in our simulations , we used @xmath63 , @xmath64 with 10 particles and 100 iterations .",
    "we have found that the optimal state for a specific type of atoms , only depends on the product of the number density of atoms and cell length , @xmath65 .",
    "this can be explained in the following way . in eqs .   and , we have @xmath66 and @xmath67 which can be written as @xmath68 for a given type of atom the multiplying factor at the front can only be varied via @xmath69 or @xmath29 .",
    "the other parameters , @xmath9 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 can be varied by changing the type of atom .",
    "these parameters affect the variation of @xmath70 in three ways :    1 .",
    "they change the multiplicative factor at the front . as that factor",
    "can also be changed by varying @xmath71 or @xmath29 , that does not give any qualitatively different results than simply changing @xmath71 or @xmath29 .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 appears in the ratio @xmath72 , and therefore provides a scaling to the variation of @xmath73 with @xmath34 .",
    "it therefore does not qualitatively change the results .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 appears in the factor @xmath74 .",
    "this factor affects the variation very little , because we consider a parameter regime where @xmath75 .    in the following we keep @xmath29 constant at @xmath76  cm and",
    "discuss the two cases : @xmath77  m@xmath17 ( large @xmath8 ) and @xmath78  m@xmath17 ( small @xmath8 ) .      for @xmath77  m@xmath17 , we have found that numerically optimized states of the form given in eq .",
    "perform better than noon states and independent single photons . in fig .",
    "[ fig - fin210 ] we have compared the fisher information of the @xmath0-photon optimal state , @xmath0 independent single photon states @xmath79 , @xmath0 copies of a single - photon noon state @xmath80 , and an @xmath0-photon noon state @xmath81 .",
    "this figure is plotted for @xmath82 ( upper row ) and @xmath83 ( lower row ) . in this figure , we have used @xmath84  thz , which is the transition frequency of the d1 line of sodium @xcite , and an atom density of @xmath85  m@xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ fig - fin210 ] shows that , even for @xmath82 , the enhancement obtained by optimal states is significant . for larger photon numbers ,",
    "as is shown in the graphs for @xmath83 , there is no further significant improvement in the enhancement of the optimal states . moreover ,",
    "the optimal states with high photon numbers are not experimentally achievable with the current technology . on the other hand",
    ", it may be possible to generate the optimal states for @xmath82 with a scheme similar to the one proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    note that , close to resonance , for copies of single - photon noon states the maximum peak is higher than for independent single photons and @xmath0-photon noon states .",
    "this is as would be expected , since single - photon noon states are the least sensitive noon states to loss . from fig .",
    "[ fig - fin210](c ) , we see that ten - photon noon states perform worse than independent single photons close to resonance . however , far from resonance , their fisher information is even higher than the numerically obtained optimal states .",
    "the reason why this is possible is that the optimal states are only optimal in the sense of giving the largest maximum fisher information , but it is possible for other states to have larger fisher information for detunings where the optimal states do not give their maximum fisher information . on the other hand , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - fin210](a ) , two - photon noon states are less sensitive to loss ( compared to ten - photon noon states ) , and close to resonance they perform better than independent single photons .",
    "the other thing to note from fig .",
    "[ fig - fin210 ] is that to be able to work in the region with maximum fisher information we need to have prior knowledge of the detuning .",
    "this is because the peaks of maximum fisher information are quite narrow . in other words",
    "this scheme could be used to measure hyperfine splitting of atomic levels , or measure external effects , such as magnetic field , on the transition frequency of atoms .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - amp ] we have plotted the values of the coefficients of the optimal states , @xmath49 in the superposition , for a range of photon numbers from @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "this figure shows that the optimal states have higher amplitudes for the terms with higher photon numbers in the arm that contains the atomic ensemble .",
    "that is , when there are more photons in the arm with the ensemble , they are more likely to be lost , giving more information about @xmath34 .     of the optimal states , for four values of the total photon number @xmath0 . ]       and phase shift @xmath33 versus @xmath34 , for a range of values of number density of atoms @xmath8 . ]     for total number of photons @xmath82 , for a range of number densities of atoms @xmath8 .",
    "solid , red line : @xmath0 independent single photons with @xmath86  m@xmath17 . dashed , green line : @xmath0 independent single photons with @xmath87  m@xmath17 . dashed , black line : numerically optimized state with @xmath88  m@xmath17 . ]    for smaller values of @xmath8 than considered in the previous subsection , the range of the phase shift is smaller ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - j1 ] ) . in this case",
    ", the optimal state is @xmath0 independent single photons , @xmath89 .",
    "having all the photons in the upper arm , only the loss is being probed , and no information is being obtained from the phase shift . the phase shift must be significant so that we can take advantage of interferometric schemes in spectroscopy . surprisingly for @xmath90 m@xmath17 the maximum of the fisher information for @xmath0 independent single photons is even higher than the maximum of the fisher information for the @xmath0-photon numerically optimized states with a larger number density of atoms which were considered in the previous subsection ( see fig .  [ fig - fis ] ) .",
    "this could be understood from the variation of the transmissivity @xmath35 and phase shift @xmath33 with @xmath8 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - j1 ] . for smaller values of @xmath8",
    "the range of the phase shift is also smaller , which eliminates the advantage in using entangled states . in this case , the fisher information is coming from the variation in the absorption . as @xmath8 is decreased further , the dip in the absorption is reduced which results in a smaller fisher information . for the higher densities",
    ", there is a larger phase shift , but it is in a region where the absorption is very high .",
    "in this work we found optimal multi - photon states for measurement of the transition frequency of atoms . the scheme proposed here is an interferometric scheme with photon number detection in the output . in order to find the best states for measurement of the transition frequency , we numerically optimised for the states that provide the largest fisher information .    for the number density of atoms we considered initially ,",
    "the imposed phase on the probe is large , and it is advantageous to using information from both the absorption and the phase shift for measuring the transition frequency . in this case , the optimal state is an entangled multi - photon state .",
    "this optimal state has a large weighting on the state with all photons in the arm with the atomic ensemble . on the other hand , for a smaller number density of atoms , the phase shift imposed on the probe",
    "is small and therefore the information from the phase shift is not significant enough to give any advantage . in this case , it is advantageous to pass all the photons through the atom cell and obtain all the information from absorption .",
    "surprisingly there is a value of the number density , @xmath91  m@xmath17 , for which @xmath0 independent single photons have the highest fisher information ; even higher than the fisher information for the @xmath0-photon numerically optimised states with a larger number density of atoms .",
