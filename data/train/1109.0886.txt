    "phenomena such as vacuum rabi splitting @xcite , photon blockade @xcite and single photon sources @xcite have now been observed .",
    "so far , experiments in cqed have almost exclusively been carried out with single cavities . in recent years",
    "however , it has become possible to fabricate microcavities in regular arrays in various settings @xcite . due to their small size",
    ", these cavities all have small mode volume and correspondingly a strong interaction between light and matter .",
    "indeed the `` strong coupling '' regime has already been demonstrated for several of these devices  @xcite .",
    "an important next step is to find a way to couple these cavities so that they form an array in which photons can tunnel from one cavity to another .",
    "recently , various approaches have been put forward for using such arrays of coupled cavities as a platform for quantum simulators  @xcite .",
    "these include a scheme for simulating the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite , models of interacting jaynes - cummings hamiltonians @xcite , and an effective spin hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the phase diagrams of these models have been studied @xcite and the existence of a glassy phase has been predicted @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we describe the design for a practical device , in which atoms interact strongly with high finesse microcavities and , at the same time , photons can tunnel with low loss from one cavity to the next through an interconnecting waveguide chip .",

    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec :",

    "we discuss briefly a variety of applications that can be based on these capabilities but go beyond the two cavity setting .",

    "the maximum value @xmath63 , determined by the maximum field overlap and the length of the coupling region , can be as high as @xmath64s@xmath65 .",

    "in addition , equation ( [ eq : spinham ] ) ignores the loss of photons from the cavity .",

    "also shown is the small population @xmath159 of cavity photons .",
    "significant further improvement in the coherence is possible in principle if the dissipation in the waveguide cavity is also reduced . in practice",
    ", this will require an advance in integrated waveguide technology to achieve smaller propagation losses than the current state of the art .",
    "the experiments that we have studied in some detail in the previous subsection serve to demonstrate both the ability to couple separate cavities and to create effective interactions between the atoms that are held in each cavity .",
    "these are essential capabilities that provide the basis for a wide variety of more challenging experiments for which we would like to briefly outline some examples here .",
    "a stringent test of the coherence properties of transport in extended chains of cavities is provided by the transport of quantum entanglement through the chain . here",
    "one might envisage the initial creation of entanglement by controlled quantum dynamics either between directly neighbouring cavities to generate entangled two - mode squeezed states between two cavity modes or between atomic qubits held in different resonators .",
    "most promising in this context though appears to be the generation of entanglement between an atomic qubit and the photonic degree of freedom of the cavity it is residing in .",
    "once created , the coherent coupling between constituents of the cavity array will lead to transport of the state of the photonic degree of freedom as described in a harmonic chain @xcite . at a suitably chosen time when we expect maximal entanglement between the atomic qubit and the photonic degree of freedom of a distant cavity we",
    "would then probe for the entanglement either by quantum state tomography or by measurement of restricted sets of observables as described in @xcite .",
    "another approach to determining coherence in cavity arrays exploits the quantum coherent effect of dynamical localization @xcite in a harmonic chain @xcite governed by a hamiltonian of the type @xmath305 that is , a chain of sites subject to a hopping interaction with strength @xmath33 and a static and a time - varying field that affect their on - site energies energies via @xmath306 and @xmath307 respectively .",
    "this may be realised by a spin model or , alternatively , by a set of harmonic oscillators replacing @xmath308 ( @xmath309 ) by @xmath310 ( @xmath297 ) respectively . in a spin model",
    "the variation of the on - site energies could be obtained by a time dependent magnetic field gradient , which induces a shift of the energy levels . for harmonic oscillator systems the cavity resonance frequencies would have to be shifted for example via modulations of the resonator lengths or of the refractive index inside a resonator due to the presence of a detuned two level system .",
    "the existence of the dynamical localization and its coherent character may be seen by moving to an interaction picture defined by @xmath311 with @xmath312 in which the time - dependent on - site energies vanish at the expense of introducing a time - dependent coupling strengths between the neighbouring sites @xcite . for small coupling strength",
    "@xmath33 the hopping dynamics is negligible over the interval @xmath313 $ ] and then we find the effective time - averaged hamiltonian @xmath314 if @xmath315 and if @xmath316 coincides with a zero of the bessel function @xmath317 , then the evolution of a wave - packet becomes periodic in time , the spreading of the wave - packet is suppressed , and hence transport is suppressed .",
    "this expresses itself as resonances in the ability of the chain to transport excitation , which one can observe directly without the need for process tomography . in the averaging that gives rise to the bessel function , it is the destructive interference of amplitudes that suppresses the transport . in a classical system",
    ", this interference is absent and there is no localisation .",
    "the strength of dynamic localization can in fact be used to infer the level of quantum coherence in the system without needing detailed measurements or tomography , but depending purely on the quality of the transport @xcite .",
    "systems with finite correlation length , such as the 1-d heisenberg and xx models , allow sizeable ground - state end - to - end entanglement , independent of the size of the system , provided that simple patterns of site - dependent couplings are selected .",
    "this phenomenon has been termed long - distance entanglement ( lde ) and can be implemented in cavity arrays @xcite .",
    "the realisation of a model with spin - spin interactions of xx type requires local control , as described in section 6 , to create position - dependent coupling between neighbouring sites .",
    "in particular it will be necessary to couple the first and last sites of the chain to the bulk of the chain weakly in order to obtain strong entanglement between those two sites in the ground state of the chain .",
    "a chain of @xmath318 cavities suffices to demonstrate this effect .",
    "the generation of complex quantum states may be achieved by a sequence of elementary quantum operations correlating pairs of sub - systems . however",
    ", under realistic conditions the resulting fidelity will tend to scale very badly with increasing number of particles and complexity of the quantum state .",
    "it may therefore be preferable to take advantage of the natural dynamics .",
    "for example , we might first prepare the system in a product state without interactions between sites , then slowly switch on the coupling between neighbouring sites . as a consequence of the adiabatic theorem , the system will remain in its instantaneous ground state , which thanks to the interactions becomes a complex entangled state .",
    "this highly entangled state of the atomic degrees of freedom could then serve as a deterministic source of highly entangled photons .",
    "indeed , the atomic degrees of freedom may be mapped onto the photonic mode at any desired time and photons allowed to escape into fibres .",
    "the generation of entanglement between distant sites in the cavity array is complicated by the fact that interactions are between nearest neighbours .",
    "distant particles may be entangled through a sequence of nearest - neighbour interactions , but the efficiency of this preparation decreases very rapidly with distance . an alternative is to use the natural dynamics of states that are not eigenstates of the system hamiltonian . thanks to the availability of local control in a cavity array , it is possible for example to prepare the atoms inside the cavities in a product state . for most spin hamiltonians , such as those generated in sec 6",
    ", this initial state will evolve in time to become highly entangled .",
    "in particular , significant two - particle entanglement will build up between sites whose distance is proportional to twice the speed of sound multiplied with the waiting time @xcite .",
    "a basic demonstration of such an experiment is already possible with three sites but may be scaled to larger arrays as the strength of the entanglement decreases only slowly with distance .",
    "in summary , we have presented a practical way to realise an array of coupled cavities that could be used for quantum simulation .",
    "the device consists of open fabry - perot microcavities that are coupled via a waveguide chip .",
    "we have demonstrated that , under suitable conditions , the dynamical evolution is well approximated by a jaynes - cummings lattice hamiltonian and that it is suitable for implementing effective spin hamiltonians .",
    "we have outlined experiments , both basic and more advanced , that could be carried out in such a device to achieve controlled quantum dynamics .",
