    "in a series of seminal papers , kirkpatrick , thirumalai and wolynes ( ktw ) suggested ten years ago that ( discontinuous ) mean - field spin glasses could serve as a paradigm for vitreous systems@xcite .",
    "the major success of ktw theory lies in its ability to predict the existence of both low ( kauzmann ) and high ( dynamical freezing ) temperature critical points and thus to describe in a unified framework the thermodynamical and dynamical signatures of the glassy transition@xcite .",
    "this achievement relies on a simple but rich picture of glassy _ pure states _ ( ps ) , that is local minima in the _ free - energy _",
    "landscape , and of the dynamical evolution taking place in the latter .",
    "to what extent ktw mean - field picture applies to real systems is a crucial issue@xcite .",
    "an apparently related approach based on the investigation of the _ potential energy _ landscape and of its local minima called _ inherent structures _",
    "( is ) had been already proposed at the beginning of the eighties by stillinger and weber in the context of liquid theory@xcite .",
    "is present a considerable advantage with respect to ps : they are well defined and free of any mean - field hallmark . recently , numerical studies proposing that some understanding of the glass transition could be gained from the analysis of potential energy landscapes@xcite strengthened the feeling that stillinger and weber s analysis and ktw theory were basically the same description of glassy systems .",
    "this point of view was later supported by the equivalence of is and ps in some mean - field spin - glasses , e.g. sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) or @xmath2-spins models@xcite and by analytical works@xcite .    in this letter , we present some arguments to clarify the relationship between is and ps .",
    "we present some one imensional models for which is can be exactly computed and do not coincide with ps .",
    "we show in addition that the degeneracy between is and ps in infinitely - connected models is due to the vanishing of the interactions in the thermodynamical limit and is lifted by the introduction of finite couplings .",
    "focusing on the tap equations `` defining '' ps and the number of the latters , we show that zero temperature ps are related to extended is , that is configurations stable with respect to an arbitrary large number @xmath0 of spin flips ( and not only to a single one as usual is)@xcite .",
    "we consider a model including @xmath3 ising spins @xmath4 .",
    "a configuration of spins will be said @xmath0-stable if its energy can not be decreased by flipping any subset of @xmath0 ( or less than @xmath0 ) spins .",
    "let us call @xmath5 the logarithm ( divided by @xmath3 ) of the number of @xmath0-stable configurations with energy density excess @xmath6 with respect to the ground state energy density @xmath7 when @xmath8 .",
    "is correspond to 1-stable configurations and @xmath9 is usually called configurational entropy .",
    "we have of course @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "the notion of ps is much trickier . in mean - field systems ps",
    "are usually defined through tap equations @xcite for the local magnetisations @xmath13 .",
    "tap solutions are exponentially numerous in the volume @xmath3 and can be accounted for through the so - called complexity @xmath14 , that is the normalised logarithm of ps having free - energy densities @xmath15 .",
    "we shall focus in the following on the zero temperature limit of the complexity @xmath16 and compare it to @xmath17 .",
    "we shall denote hereafter the maximum over @xmath18 of @xmath17 ( respectively @xmath16 ) by @xmath19 ( resp .",
    "@xmath20 ) .",
    "we first consider a ising chain with disordered nearest neighbour couplings @xmath21 and no external field@xcite .",
    "the @xmath22s are independent random variables drawn from an even distribution @xmath23 .",
    "no phase transition can take place at finite temperature : there is only one paramagnetic ps@xcite .",
    "therefore , the zero temperature limit of the complexity simply reads @xmath24 if @xmath25 , @xmath26 if @xmath27 where the ground state energy density equals @xmath28 .",
    "ettelaie and moore have calculated @xmath29@xcite .",
    "we extend their approach to obtain @xmath30 using the following observation by li : a necessary and sufficient condition for a configuration to be @xmath0-stable is that each frustrated bond be @xmath0-weak , _",
    "i.e. _ smaller in magnitude than the @xmath31 nearest bonds ( @xmath0 on the left , @xmath0 on the right ) on the chain@xcite .",
    "the typical and self - averaging @xmath17 thus reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of @xmath0-weak bonds on the chain and @xmath34 equals 1 if the @xmath35 @xmath0-weak bond is frustrated , 0 otherwise . using an integral representation of the delta function in ( [ sk1d ] ) , the @xmath36 s",
    "may be traced over and one finds @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the probability that a bond is @xmath0-weak and has value @xmath39 .",
    "the integral over @xmath40 can be evaluated by the method of steepest descent . in fig.1 , @xmath17 is plotted for a gaussian @xmath23 ( with variance unity ) and for different values of @xmath0 . at fixed @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath17 is symmetric around its maximum located in latexmath:[$e_k = e_{gs } + \\int dl p_k(l )    maximum @xmath19 , related to the total number of @xmath0-stable configurations is independent of @xmath42 as found by li@xcite . on the left boundary , all curves",
    "exhibit an infinite slope when @xmath43 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath44 if the support of @xmath23 does not contain @xmath45 and @xmath46 if @xmath47 when @xmath48 ( with @xmath49 to make @xmath7 finite ) .    the above model is a clear example of a system with many is and at the same time a single ps . more precisely , the zero temperature limit of the complexity @xmath16 ( related to ps ) is not equal to the configurational entropy @xmath9 counting is but to @xmath50 . before exposing why @xmath51 and @xmath20 accidentally coincide in infinitely connected spin - glasses ,",
    "let us briefly see to what extent the above results apply to generic finite dimensional systems .",
    "the main features of @xmath17 can be found by some general arguments which apply to any _ finite dimensional _ system .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath52 at small @xmath53 has been predicted in @xcite and depends only on the lowest - lying excitations of the system .",
    "in addition , the scaling of the right - edge energy @xmath54 at which @xmath17 vanishes can be understood by a simple energy balance argument . flipping a cluster of @xmath0 spins among a configuration with energy density @xmath18 , one may gain a bulk energy @xmath55 and loose at least some surface energy @xmath56 . as a consequence , @xmath0-stable configurations with energy densities higher than @xmath57 should not exist . for 1-d ising disordered chain ,",
    "@xmath56 is equal to the average magnitude of the smallest bond among @xmath0 ones and can be easily computed . as expected @xmath58 for large @xmath0 .",
    "let us emphasise that the previous argument implies that there can not be @xmath59-stable configurations ( after the thermodynamical limit has been taken ) with energy densities differing from the ground state one : @xmath60 .",
    "it is well known that the zero temperature limit of the complexity equals the configurational entropy in infinite connectivity spin - glasses@xcite .",
    "for instance in the case of the sk model , @xmath61 with @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the equivalence between tap solutions at zero temperature and @xmath63-stable configurations ( is ) is a straightforward consequence of the vanishing of couplings in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "the scaling of the couplings @xmath64 with size @xmath3 ensures that the excitation energy @xmath65 , corresponding to flipping spin @xmath66 remains finite in the thermodynamical limit , e.g. @xmath67 for the sk model . as a consequence the excitation energy @xmath68 corresponding to flipping both spins @xmath66 and @xmath69 reduces to @xmath70 in the large @xmath3 limit . for infinite connectivity models",
    "is are also @xmath0-stable configurations for every finite @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , @xmath71 does not depend on @xmath0 and @xmath72 .",
    "we now show that in presence of finite couplings , the degeneracy between all @xmath19s is lifted since @xmath0-stable configurations are not necessarily @xmath73-stable .",
    "in addition , we show that zero temperature tap solution are @xmath59-stable and not only @xmath63-stable .",
    "to do so , let us first recall how tap equations can be derived for a one dimensional spin glass @xcite .",
    "we call @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively the effective magnetic fields due to all the spins on the left and on the right of @xmath66 and @xmath76 the external magnetic field acting on @xmath4 .",
    "it is easy to write the equation verified by @xmath77 in terms of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80.\\ ] ] this is the equation verified by the local magnetisation of a spin @xmath4 interacting with two spins @xmath81 , @xmath82 on which the magnetic fields @xmath78 and @xmath83 act . focusing on two",
    "neighbouring spins the equations verified by the two local magnetisations are : @xmath84 these equations give @xmath77 and @xmath85 as a function of @xmath74 and @xmath83 . inverting ( [ meq1 ] ) , ( [ meq2 ] )",
    "one obtains @xmath74 and @xmath83 as functions of @xmath77 and @xmath85 . plugging @xmath86 and @xmath87 into ( [ mi ] ) the tap equations for the local magnetisations",
    "are established @xcite .    to prove that tap solutions are mapped into ground states in the zero temperature limit let us focus on @xmath0 contiguous spins on the chain .",
    "the tap equations on these @xmath0 spins are by construction the equations verified by the local magnetisations of the system of @xmath0 spins , as if it were isolated from the rest of the chain and there were magnetic fields @xmath88 , @xmath89 acting on the leftmost and rightmost spins respectively . as a consequence in the zero temperature limit , the @xmath0 local magnetisations tend towards the configuration of",
    "@xmath0 spins which realizes the global minimum of the isolated system of @xmath0 spins for any value of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "as @xmath0 can be made arbitrarily large once @xmath3 has been sent to infinity , the configurations corresponding to the zero temperature limit of tap solutions are @xmath59-stable .",
    "the argument can be straightforwardly extended to ising spin glasses on cayley trees or on random graphs .",
    "the results of the previous sections suggest that in finite connectivity models @xmath19 is a non trivial function of @xmath0 which tends towards the zero temperature limit of the complexity @xmath20 for large values of @xmath0 . to corroborate this point ,",
    "it is interesting to study a model whose complexity @xmath20 is non zero . consider the hamiltonian @xmath90 .",
    "the first term is the usual sk hamiltonian : couplings @xmath64 are independent gaussian random variables of zero mean and variance @xmath91 .",
    "the one dimensional hamiltonian involves disordered interactions @xmath22 which are independent random variables vanishing with probability @xmath92 and distributed according to an even distribution law @xmath23 with probability @xmath93 .",
    "this system smoothly interpolates between the sk model ( @xmath94 ) and the one dimensional spin glass ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "we calculate below the departures of @xmath20 and @xmath19 from their common value in the sk model to the first order in @xmath93 only to avoid useless tedious calculations .    to compute the complexity",
    "two approaches can be used .",
    "the first one consists in making the ( annealed ) sum over all locally stable tap solutions @xcite .",
    "the other method relies on the computation of the logarithm of the ( average ) @xmath96 power of the partition function using bray and moore replica symmetry breaking scheme@xcite .",
    "as @xmath97 goes to zero , the annealed complexity is recovered@xcite .",
    "calculations are sketched in appendix a and b and provide the same average complexity @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the maximum of ( [ sk0 ] ) .",
    "@xmath101 denotes the heaviside function .",
    "we now turn to the computation of @xmath19 .",
    "the excitation energy corresponding to @xmath0 spin flips depends on the sk couplings and the initial configuration through the variables @xmath102 only . for large @xmath3 ,",
    "the @xmath103s become independent of the spin configuration @xmath104 and can be written as @xmath105 , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are independent gaussian random variables of zero means and variances @xmath108 and @xmath91 respectively@xcite .",
    "the annealed configurational entropy is defined through @xmath109 once the average @xmath110 over disorder has been carried out , spins may be traced over and ( [ n1a ] ) may be evaluated for large @xmath3 by the method of steepest descent .",
    "we find @xmath111 with @xmath112 giving @xmath113 as expected , compare ( [ ninf ] ) and ( [ n2a ] ) @xcite . repeating the same calculation for @xmath114-stable configurations , we have found that they are equally numerous to the first order in @xmath93 : @xmath115 with @xmath116 for any @xmath117 .",
    "this result extends to higher orders in @xmath93 as follows .",
    "let us call @xmath118 the coefficient of @xmath119 in @xmath19 .",
    "contributions to @xmath118 come from disordered lattices of @xmath39 bonds involving clusters of at most @xmath120 contiguous spins along the chain .",
    "clearly , spin configurations on such lattices that are @xmath120-stable are for ever stable .",
    "therefore , @xmath121 for any @xmath122 .",
    "we have in particular explicitely checked that @xmath123 .    as a conclusion",
    ", we have found a mean - field model with non zero complexity @xmath20 and @xmath124 .",
    "we have checked that @xmath125 coincides with @xmath126 to the first order in the density of @xmath127 couplings .",
    "the above examples have shown the differences between is and ps even in mean - field models provided that finite couplings are present .",
    "our results could also be extended to models with continuous degrees of freedom , e.g. systems of @xmath3 interacting particles@xcite . in this case",
    "is are configurations stable against _ infinitesimal _ moves of any subset of the @xmath3 particles , that is local minima of the potential energy .",
    "@xmath0-stable local minima can be defined as is stable against _ finite _ moves of any subset of @xmath0 ( or less than @xmath0 ) particles .",
    "@xmath59-stable minima gather all configurations that can be reached from each other by crossing finite barriers and are related to ps .    from the equilibrium point of view , ps and thus complexity are the only relevant concepts .",
    "the decomposition of the partition function put forward by stillinger based on is though mathematically exact does not seem to be thermodynamically founded@xcite .",
    "however , usual nucleation arguments imply that no ps with free - energy @xmath128 can live forever , that is @xmath129 .",
    "we thus face the following alternative .",
    "either nucleation arguments break down for some reason and finite - dimensional glassy systems with full curves for @xmath14 may exist@xcite . or they hold and the ktw entropy crisis scenario can not be extended to realistic systems without taking into account the notion of life time for ps ( as was already emphasized in @xcite ) .",
    "is , besides their phenomenological interest can be seen as a very valuable step in that direction .",
