    "the dynamics of the long term evolution of small bodies revolving beyond the neptune s orbit and forming the edgeworth - kuiper belt is a hot research topic in planetary science . since 1992 ,",
    "when the first small body was discovered ( jewitt and luu , 1993 ) , hundreds of such small bodies , called trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) , have been detected and are included in the associated list of the minor planet center ( http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/ mpc.html , jewitt , 1999 ) .",
    "the study of their dynamical evolution provides valuable information towards the understanding of the origin , the formation and the structure of our solar system ( morbidelli et al , 2003 ) .",
    "the first theoretical and numerical studies ( e.g. torbett and smoluchovski , 1990 ; kneevi et al , 1991 ; duncan et al . , 1995 ; gallardo and ferraz - mello , 1998 ; see also the review paper by morbidelli , 1999 , and references therein ) showed the important role of resonances for the capture and the long term stability of tno s .",
    "the most simple but efficient model for understanding the underlying dynamics of the resonant orbits in kuiper belt is the restricted three - body problem ( rtbp ) where the primary bodies are the sun and neptune and the small body ( of negligible mass ) represents a potential tno .",
    "the dynamics can be understood by studying the phase space structure of this simple model , where chaos and order coexist . the simplest model , namely the planar circular rtbp , is a conservative system of two degrees of freedom and for each energy level the particular qualitative characteristics of the dynamics are revealed clearly by calculating the corresponding poincar surface of section . based on this tool , malhotra ( 1996 ) studied some main mean motion resonances with neptune and showed that resonances are associated with stable motion which is a libration with respect to the corresponding resonant angle @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the external resonance ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this property had been also indicated , using a different approach to the problem , by morbidelli et al , 1995 .",
    "the center of libration is a fixed point on the poincar section that corresponds to a resonant stable periodic orbit for the particular energy level .",
    "it is well known that the periodic orbits and their stability are essentially associated with the structure of the phase space ( berry , 1978 ; hadjidemetriou,1993,1998 ) .",
    "stable periodic orbits are surrounded by invariant tori and the motion is regular while unstable periodic orbits are associated with a hyperbolic structure .",
    "consequently the usefulness of the computation of families of periodic orbits is to understand the dynamics in an open interval of energy levels without spending an exaggerative computational time . in the planar elliptic problem , which is of two degrees of freedom but non - autonomous ,",
    "the poincar sections are four dimensional and , subsequently , their usefulness is reduced significantly compared with that of the autonomous case .",
    "but the knowledge of periodic orbits provides essential information for the dynamics as in the autonomous case .",
    "it is clarified in section 2 that such periodic orbits are isolated in a hyperplane of constant eccentricity of neptune and , thus , information is provided only for a small subset of the phase space .",
    "nevertheless , the localization of a stable periodic orbit in this case is associated with the existence of regular orbits in the neighborhood of such a periodic orbit .",
    "additionally , the numerical simulations show that the eccentricity of neptune introduce small perturbations to the circular problem that do not affect significantly the long term stability of the resonant librating motion near the stable periodic orbits of the circular problem ( malhotra , 1996 ; kotoulas and voyatzis , 2004a ) .",
    "the periodic orbits of the planar circular rtbp have been extensively studied since the decade of 60 . a detailed review , which includes the associated definitions , theoretical aspects , references and examples , is given by hnon ( 1997 ) . the basic theory and the numerical methods for the computation of periodic orbits in the planar elliptic problem",
    "have been described in detail by broucke ( 1969a , b ) and their application in our solar system and the asteroidal motion has been shown ( e.g. hadjidemetriou , 1988,1992 )",
    ". applications also can be found for the dynamics of extra - solar systems ( haghighipour et al , 2003 ) .",
    "as far as the kuiper belt dynamics is concerned , the families of symmetric periodic orbits in the 1/2 , 2/3 and 3/4 resonances have been studied ( kotoulas and hadjidemetriou , 2002 ) and , as well , the 1/2 , 1/3 and 1/4 resonant symmetric and asymmetric families in the planar circular problem ( voyatzis et al 2004 ) . also , the 2/3 resonant periodic orbits are studied by varadi ( 1999 ) , for various mass ratio and eccentricity values of the primaries .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the resonant motion through the computation of the periodic orbits . a considerable number of resonances that are present in the kuiper belt dynamics and located between 30 and 48 a.u .",
    "is included in our study .",
    "namely , we examine the first order resonances @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , the second order resonances 3/5 , 5/7 and 7/9 and the third order ones 4/7 , 5/8 and 7/10 . at this stage",
    "we restrict our study to the planar circular and planar elliptic case of the rtbp . in section 2",
    "we present the formulation of the rtbp model and the periodicity conditions used in the present work . in section 3",
    "we present the families of periodic orbits computed for the planar circular model . in section 4",
    "we discuss on the continuation of periodic orbits in the elliptic case and present the results of our computations .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and discuss about the resonant structures obtained and their consequences in the long term stability of the small bodies .",
    "we consider the planar restricted three body problem with primaries the sun and neptune of mass @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the gravitational constant is set equal to unit . in the inertial orthogonal frame @xmath7 ,",
    "the motion of neptune is either circular or elliptic round the center @xmath8 with eccentricity @xmath9 , semimajor axis @xmath10 and period @xmath11 . in the rotating orthogonal frame of reference @xmath12 , where the sun and neptune define the @xmath13-axis , the motion of the small body",
    "is described by the lagrangian ( roy , 1982 ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the distance between the primaries and @xmath18 the angle between the axes @xmath13 and @xmath19 . for the circular problem",
    "it is @xmath20 , @xmath21 and there exist the _",
    "constant @xmath22 written in the form @xmath23 for the mass of neptune we use the value @xmath6=5.178@xmath24 .    in the circular problem a symmetric periodic orbit can be defined by the initial conditions @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 and the periodicity conditions are @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the period of the orbit which is unknown .",
    "we can represent such a periodic orbit as a point in the plane @xmath31 , where @xmath22 is the corresponding _ jacobi _ constant . by varying the value of @xmath32 ( or @xmath22 )",
    "we get a monoparametric family of periodic orbits with parameter @xmath32 ( or @xmath22 ) . generally , the period @xmath30 changes along the family and the eccentricity @xmath33 that corresponds to the initial conditions of the periodic orbit is either almost constant and approximatelly equal to zero or it changes significantly along the family ( see section 2 ; henon , 1997 ) .",
    "the multiplicity of a periodic orbit is defined as the number of crosses of the orbit with the axis @xmath34 in the same direction ( @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) in a period . in the elliptic case , the periodic orbits are isolated points in the plane @xmath37 for a particular value of @xmath9 and their period is @xmath38 .",
    "therefore the same periodicity conditions ( [ pcond1 ] ) hold but the value of @xmath30 is known a priori . a monoparametric family of symmetric periodic orbits is formed by analytic continuation varying @xmath9 ( the parameter of the family ) .",
    "such a family can be represented as a curve in the 3d space @xmath39 .    in our computations",
    "the periodicity conditions are solved by a newton - raphson shooting algorithm ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) with accuracy @xmath40 or @xmath41 for the circular and the elliptic case respectively . only for some difficult cases ( e.g. near collisions )",
    "we were forced to decrease the accuracy by one decimal order .",
    "the numerical integrations were performed using a control step bulirch - stoer method .",
    "the starting points for the computation of the families of periodic orbits in the circular case are obtained from poincar sections at a particular level of the _ jacobi _ constant . for the elliptic problem we started from the known bifurcation points derived from the families of the circular problem .",
    "our algorithm controls automatically the possible change of the multiplicity of the orbits and the step of the parameter of the family .",
    "since a symmetric periodic orbit crosses the @xmath34 axis at least twice , the algorithm may change the starting point of the periodic orbits when the convergence to the prescribed accuracy fails .",
    "the linear stability of the periodic orbits is determined from the corresponding stability indices . for the planar circular case the stability index @xmath42",
    "is computed , where @xmath43 are the elements of the monodromy matrix ( hnon , 1997 ) . for the planar elliptic case",
    "we calculate the indices @xmath44 and @xmath45 introduced by broucke ( 1969a , b ) . for both cases",

    "we consider the planar circular case of the rtbp .",
    "the families of symmetric periodic orbits are classified in two different kinds ( poincar , 1892 ; henon , 1997 ) : + _ families of circular orbits ( or first kind ) _ : the periodic orbits correspond to nearly circular orbits for the small body .",
    "the period @xmath30 , and subsequently the resonance @xmath46 , varies along the family .",
    "+ _ resonant families ( or second kind ) _ : the periodic orbits correspond to almost elliptic orbits for the small body .",

    "the circular periodic orbits of the unperturbed problem ( @xmath53 ) are continued for @xmath54 and a family @xmath55 of first kind exists at each particular value of @xmath6 .",
    "the families of resonant periodic orbits originate from the @xmath1-resonant orbits of the family @xmath55 . in each resonance , independently of its order , there exist two different families , @xmath56 and @xmath57 of second kind , which differ in phase .",

    "the families may consist of many segments separated by gaps which correspond to close encounter orbits where computations fail .",
    "we use the notation @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) , where @xmath1 denotes the corresponding resonance and @xmath60 numbers the possible different segments in the family . in the following discussion and plots we select the variable @xmath32 as the parameter for the characteristic curves that present the resonant families .    )",

    "the families @xmath171 and @xmath172 join smoothly at a relatively low value of the primary s eccentricity ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "such a property is also obtained for the families @xmath174 and @xmath175 , which join at @xmath176 .",
    "however , the family @xmath177 does not show a typical continuation .",
    "it starts out from bp2 with unstable orbits and continues by increasing @xmath9 up to the value 0.767 .",
    "at this point , @xmath9 decreases along the family and the periodic orbits are stable .",
    "the stable orbits occupy a short segment ( @xmath178 ) in the family which is followed by a segment with complex unstable orbits ( @xmath179 ) . for @xmath180 the orbits become doubly unstable and the family terminates at @xmath181 . this termination point is not either a collision orbit or a strongly chaotic one and we are not able to interpret it .",
    "also , there is not any obvious reason for the failure of calculations .",
    "comparatively to the 4/7 resonance , the resonances 5/8 and 7/10 have four bifurcation points too .",
    "however , the stability type of the bifurcating families differs and is indicated in table 1 .",
    "the continuation of the families shows the same qualitative characteristics as these described above .",
    "closing our study on the elliptic problem we should state that in all cases of unstable periodic orbits the stability indices have values slightly larger than 2.0 .",
    "this fact , beside numerical integrations , suggests that chaos is not present in a sense of practical importance .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of stable and unstable asymptotic manifolds changes the phase space topology .",
    "the orbits that start in the neighborhood of unstable periodic orbits show a large variation in their orbital elements in comparison with that shown by the orbits which start near a stable periodic orbit .",
    "a typical example of the evolution of the eccentricity along some orbits of the same family @xmath177 but of different stability type is shown in fig.10b .",
    "the presented trajectories correspond to the initial conditions @xmath182 and @xmath183 which coincide with that of the periodic orbits @xmath184 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 indicated in fig.10a while we have set @xmath185 .",
    "the time scale is based on neptune s period , namely @xmath186t.u.=165 years . for the trajectory starting near @xmath167 , which is stable",
    ", the evolution of the eccentricity @xmath123 shows small amplitude oscillations around the starting value .",
    "in contrast , the evolution of @xmath187 along the orbits that start near the simply unstable periodic orbit @xmath184 and the doubly unstable @xmath168 shows remarkable deviation from the initial value",
    ". however , for both cases of instability , the evolution seems regular .",
    "it is worth to mention that the orbits along the families @xmath188 intersect the orbit of neptune in general ( as in the case of fig .",
    "6c ) but the collision of the bodies is avoided because of phase protection . for the families",
    "@xmath189 the intersection of orbits occurs only for orbits belonging in some particular short segments of the families .",
    "we did not find any collision orbits along the families studied in the elliptic rtbp .",
    "in this paper we presented families of resonant symmetric periodic orbits obtained for the planar rtbp and considering @xmath190 ( the normalized mass of neptune ) .",
    "thus , our study on the circular rtbp is associated to the kuiper belt dynamics and its most important resonances between 30 and 48 a.u .",
    "particularly we studied systematically the first order resonances 2/3 , 3/4 , 4/5 , 5/6 and 6/7 , the second order ones 3/5 , 5/7 and 7/9 and the third order ones 4/7 , 5/8 and 7/10 for the circular and the elliptic rtbp . based on well established methods and previous results of hnon , broucke and hadjidemetriou , we determined all the families of the above mentioned resonances and presented their main characteristic such as bifurcation points , stability , continuation and collisions .    for the circular planar problem we found that all studied resonances have two families of periodic orbits : the family @xmath56 and the family @xmath57 .",
    "family @xmath57 consist always of stable periodic orbits while unstable periodic orbits are obtained only in a short segment of family @xmath56 located between the origin of the family and the first collision point which is met",
    ". also very short segments of unstable orbits are obtained close to collisions but in these cases the computations are ambiguous .",
    "the stable orbits constitute centers for resonant librating motion where trans - neptunian objects can be captured .",
    "the families , though they are interrupted by collisions , extend up to large values of the jacobi constant preserving their stability i.e. regular highly eccentric motion can be localized for each resonance at least in the level of the rtbp model . for all resonances we located the bifurcation points at @xmath102 which are starting points for families of periodic orbits for the elliptic problem . at each one of them a pair of families ( @xmath191 and @xmath192 ) originates .",
    "thus for @xmath193 , which is the eccentricity of the neptune s orbit we obtain isolated periodic orbits , one in each family .",
    "the families of the elliptic problem start withm either stable or unstable orbits .",
    "the stability type of the bifurcating families is preserved up to the value @xmath9 of the neptune s orbit , but in many cases it changes for larger values of @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues of the unstable orbits are always very close to the value + 1 ( i.e. at least one stability index is slightly greater than 2 ) .",
    "this situation has been also observed for internal resonances ( hadjidemetriou , 1993 ) and indicates the existence of weak instability at the particular regions in phase space .",
    "indeed , our numerical simulations show that in the neighborhood of unstable periodic orbits of the elliptic problem the motion seems regular for long term evolution but the orbital elements show slow and large variation .",
    "generally , collisions are responsible for the generation of strong chaos but in the elliptic problem all the families found avoid collisions with neptune . only the families @xmath191 which bifurcate from the most eccentric bifurcation point seem to terminate at a collision with the sun as @xmath194 .    as far as the planar rtbp is concerned , our systematic study on resonant periodic orbits verifies the dynamical structures obtained in the past for other resonant cases .",
    "additionally , we should remark the following points : a ) the scenario of bifurcation and continuation of the families of first order resonances ( guillaume , 1974 ; hadjidemetriou , 1993 ) , shows some differentiation when the resonant families avoid collisions with the planet . in our study , this is obtained for the @xmath65 and @xmath66 families , which join together forming a closed characteristic curve b)the families of the elliptic problem seem to extend either up to the rectilinear case ( @xmath125 ) or join smoothly with another family forming characteristic curves that start from one bifurcation point and terminate to another one .",
    "c ) it has been suggested ( voyatzis et al , 2004 ) that the existence of asymmetric periodic orbits is associated with the existence of continuous segments of unstable orbits along a family of symmetric orbits .",
    "this condition is true for the resonances of the form @xmath195 . in our study of the circular problem no any families with such a property",
    "have been found . in the elliptic problem the families @xmath166 and @xmath196 include a segment of unstable periodic orbits and , subsequently , we may conjecture the existence of asymmetric periodic orbits in these cases .",
    "an interesting extension of the present work is to determine the families of periodic orbits in the three dimensional ( 3d ) rtbp .",
    "the bifurcation points of families of 3d periodic orbits are given in kotoulas and voyatzis ( 2004b ) .",
    "the 3d resonant structure should provide useful information about the capture of trans - neptunian objects in highly inclined orbits .",
    "interesting structures of resonant motion can also be provided by the study of asymmetric resonances located beyond 48 a.u . and are not included in the present study .",
