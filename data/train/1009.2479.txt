    "an important aspect of solar activity are the grand minima periods during which the activity level is strongly reduced .",
    "the best example of this is the maunder minimum during 16451715 ( eddy 1976 ; ribes & nesme - ribes 1993 ) .",
    "it is important not only to the solar physics community but also to the space weather and earth climate community as it may be correlated to the little ice age .",
    "it is not an artifact of few observations , but a real phenomenon @xcite .",
    "there are evidences that solar - like stars also show maunder - like minima @xcite .",
    "the maunder minimum episode may be divided into two periods : one from 1645 to 1670 and another from 1670 to 1715 . during the first period ,",
    "the sunspot number was almost zero in both the hemispheres , whereas during the second period , a few sunspots appeared in the southern hemisphere .",
    "so there was a strong north ",
    "south asymmetry of sunspot number in the last phase of the maunder minimum ( ribes & nesme - ribes 1993 ; sokoloff & nesme - ribes 1994 ) .",

    "( 1998 ) suggested that the usual 11  year period of solar activity ( schwabe cycle ) continued during the maunder minimum , although the overall activity level was weaker .",

    "2009 ; hotta & yokoyama 2010a ) are the most promising models for studying the solar cycle .",
    "it explains many important features of the regular solar cycle including 11  year periodicity , equatorial migration of the sunspot belt , poleward migration of large - scale field and parity , etc .",
    "it also reproduces many irregular features of the solar cycle ( charbonneau & dikpati 2000 ; choudhuri & karak 2009 ; karak & choudhuri 2010a , 2010b ) .",
    "the flux transport dynamo model consists of the following processes .",
    "a strong toroidal component of the magnetic field is generated in the tachocline due to the strong differential rotation @xcite .",
    "when this toroidal magnetic field rises above the stable layer , the magnetic buoyancy acts on it causing it to rise to the surface to form sunspots .",
    "these sunspots decay to give rise to the poloidal component of the magnetic field through the babcock ",
    "leighton mechanism ( babcock 1961 ; leighton 1969 ) , which then gets advected ( also diffused ) to the pole by the meridional circulation .",
    "this field ultimately reaches the tachocline where it again gets stretched to give rise to the toroidal field and the cycle completes . in this process , the poloidal field is produced from the decay of the tilted bipolar sunspots .",
    "these tilts are due to the coriolis force acting on the rising flux tubes ( dsilva & choudhuri 1993 ) . in addition ,",
    "when these flux tubes rise through the convection zone , they are subjected to the convective buffeting ( longcope & choudhuri 2002 ) .",
    "this gives rise to a scatter in the tilt angles around the mean given by joy s law @xcite .",
    "we therefore believe that the babcock ",
    "leighton process is not a deterministic process . as a result ,",
    "the polar field changes randomly as its production is governed by the random process @xcite .",
    "following this idea , choudhuri & karak ( 2009 ) have proposed that at the beginning of the maunder minimum , the polar field fell to a very low value . with this assumption , they have succeeded in reproducing a maunder minimum using a flux transport dynamo model . some authors ( choudhuri 1992 ; gmez & mininni 2006 ; wilmot - smith et al . 2005 ; brandenburg & spiegel 2008 ; moss et al .",
    "2008 ; usoskin et al . 2009 ) are also able to reproduce maunder - like grand minima by introducing stochastic fluctuations or nonlinearity in dynamo parameters . by introducing stochastic fluctuations in the flux transport dynamo simulations , charbonneau et al .",
    "( 2004 ) are able to reproduce intermittencies which resemble the maunder minimum . on the other hand ,",
    "beer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) proposed the nonlinearity to be the cause of such irregularities of the solar cycle .",
    "another vital source of irregularity in the flux transport dynamo model is the meridional circulation which plays a major role in transporting the magnetic fields .",
    "it determines not only the period but also the amplitude of the solar cycle ( wang et al .",
    "1991 ; dikpati & charbonneau 1999 ; hathaway et al .",
    "2003 ; yeates et al .",
    "it also varies stochastically with time , giving randomness in the solar activity .",
    "recently several authors ( hathaway 1996 ; haber et al .",
    "2002 ; basu & antia 2003 ; gizon & rempel 2008 ; hathaway & rightmire 2010 ) have reported its value in the upper part of the convection zone and found strong temporal variation of its amplitude .",
    "javaraiah & ulrich ( 2006 ) studied group sunspot data during cycles 1223 and found a cycle - to - cycle variation of mean meridional motion of sunspot groups ( a proxy of the meridional flow ) .",
    "several other indirect studies ( wang et al . 2002 ; hathaway et al .",
    "2003 ; georgieva & kirov 2010 ) have found the evidences of the fluctuations of the meridional circulation .",
    "moreover , using a low order model constructed from the sunspot number as the proxy of the toroidal field , passos & lopes ( 2008 ) have suggested that the last @xmath3 magnetic cycles can be modeled using variable meridional circulation speed only . using similar a model , passos & lopes ( 2009 )",
    "have also concluded that the stochastic fluctuations in the @xmath4-effect can not trigger a grand minimum , rather they argued that the strong decrease of meridional circulation can do so .",
    "the motivation of this work is to find out and understand the influence of the meridional circulation on both cycle - to - cycle amplitude variation of the the solar cycle and producing grand minima .",
    "therefore , first , we try to model the periods of the last @xmath0 sunspot cycles just by varying the amplitude of  to see its effect on the amplitude of the solar cycle .",

    "2008 for details ) .",
    "however , we discuss the result from advection - dominated flux transport dynamo model ( e.g. , dikpati & charbonneau 1999 ) as well . by the term `` advection - dominated ''",
    "we mean that the diffusivity of the poloidal field in the whole convection zone is low ( @xmath9@xmath10 @xmath7 s@xmath8 ) . in this model , therefore , the diffusivity is not so important in transporting the fields . in a high - diffusivity model",
    ", we have found that most of the cycle amplitudes get modeled up to some extent when we try to model the periods of the last @xmath0 cycles just by varying the amplitude of  only .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a major part of the fluctuations of the amplitude of the solar cycle may come from the fluctuations in meridional circulation .",
    "however , we do get a completely different result , if the dynamo is in the advection - dominated regime .",
    "the physics of getting these two completely different results from these two models can be understood based on the yeates et al .",
    "( 2008 ) study what we mention in the appropriate place .",
    "next , we also study the importance of meridional circulation in producing a maunder - like grand minimum in both the high - diffusivity model and the low - diffusivity model .",
    "we propose that at the beginning of the maunder minimum , the amplitude of meridional circulation dropped to a low value and then after a few years it increased again to the original value . with this assumption",
    ", we have checked the possibility of producing ( or not producing ) a maunder - like grand minimum in both the models . in the next step ,",
    "we have also included the fluctuations of polar field to capture the fluctuations in the  process along with that of  to model such kind of grand minimum .",
    "to study the evolution of the magnetic fields , we have to solve above two equations with the given parameters .",
    "recently this problem has been extensively studied by two different groups ( dikpati & charbonneau 1999 and chatterjee et al .",
    "dikpati & charbonneau ( 1999 ) ( also dikpati et al .",
    "2004 ) use a very low value ( @xmath20@xmath10 @xmath7 s@xmath8 ) of the diffusivity of the poloidal field in the convection zone , whereas chatterjee et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( also jiang et al .",
    "2007 ) use very high value ( @xmath21@xmath6 @xmath7  s@xmath8 ) .",
    "although both the models can explain some important features of the solar cycle ( e.g. , 11  year periodicity , equatorward propagation of the sunspot belt ) ( dikpati & charbonneau 1999 ; chatterjee et al .",
    "2004 ) , in many cases , they give completely different results ( chatterjee et al .",
    "2004 ; jiang et al . 2007 ;",
    "yeates et al .",
    "2008 ; karak & choudhuri 2010b ) .",
    "therefore , we are curious to see the importance of meridional circulation in modeling both the solar cycle and the maunder - like grand minimum in these two models separately .",
    "to do this , we first use the high - diffusivity model of chatterjee et al .",
    "( 2004 ) with the same profiles of @xmath4 coefficient , differential rotation , meridional circulation and diffusivity as given in the `` standard model '' of chatterjee et al .",
    "we do not repeat them here .",
    "however , karak & choudhuri ( 2010b ) have changed some parameters of this model which are listed in table  2 of their paper . in the present work",
    ", we use these parameters except we take @xmath22 = @xmath23 m and the surface value of  @xmath24 = @xmath25 m  s@xmath8 . with these parameters",
    "the period of the solar cycle comes out to be around 11  year . in all the analyses ,",
    "only the amplitude of  is varied while all other parameters of the model are held fixed .",
    "a related question at this stage may arise that any change in the  may be accompanied by the change in the differential rotation .",
    "since the present understanding of these two is very primitive and our aim is to understand the effect of the fluctuation of  on the solar cycle , we have taken differential rotation to be constant in all the analyses .",
    "for the low - diffusivity calculations , if we decrease the diffusivity to a very low value ( @xmath26 @xmath7 s@xmath8 ) in the previous model , we do not get an oscillatory solution .",
    "therefore , we have tried to use the dikpati et al .",
    "( 2004 ) model , but we ( and also jiang et al .",
    "2007 ; hotta & yokoyama 2010a ; karak & choudhuri 2010b ) are not able to reproduce their results .",
    "finally , we use the dikpati & charbonneau ( 1999 ) model with the same parameters as listed in their ` reference solution ' except for the value of @xmath27 . to get an 11  year period in their model ,",
    "we use @xmath27 = @xmath28 m  s@xmath8 rather than @xmath29 m  s@xmath8 what they have reported in their `` reference solution '' . an important point to note",
    "is that the maximum amplitude of meridional circulation at the surface ( what chatterjee et al .",
    "2004 call @xmath24 in their model ) is much less than this @xmath27 .",
    "first , we model the last @xmath0 cycles by fitting the periods with variable meridional circulation in a high - diffusivity model . we have done this in the following way .",
    "it is known that the  acts as a clock to regulate the period of the solar cycle ( wang et al .",
    "1991 ; dikpati & charbonneau 1999 ; hathaway et al . 2003 ) .",
    "stronger  gives a shorter period and vice versa .",
    "it is found that in the flux transport dynamo model , the period of the solar cycle roughly scales as the inverse of the  amplitude .",
    "therefore , we first calculate the dependency of period ( @xmath30 ) on @xmath24 by running the model at different values of @xmath24 and we find a relation @xmath31 ( when @xmath32 ) . then from the observed periods of the last @xmath0 cycles we can calculate the corresponding @xmath24 from the above relation . the dashed line in fig .  [ fit23](a ) shows this variation .",
    "however , these values of @xmath24 do not reproduce the observed periods properly ; therefore , we fit them by trial and error methods .",
    "we did not try to match the periods of each cycle accurately which is a little bit difficult .",
    "we change @xmath24 abruptly between two cycles and not during a cycle .",
    "in addition , we do not change @xmath24 if the period difference between two successive cycles is less than @xmath33 of the average period .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fit23](a ) shows the variation of @xmath24 used to model the periods of the cycles .",
    "now , we repeat the same analysis in a low - diffusivity model too . in this model ,",
    "the dependency of the period on @xmath27 is given by eq .",
    "( 12 ) of dikpati & charbonneau ( 1999 ) . from the observed periods",
    "we calculate @xmath27 according to this relation and we show this variation by the dashed line in fig  [ fitlow](a ) .",
    "then we fit the periods of the last @xmath0 cycles by trial and error in the same way as we have done earlier .",
    "next , to reproduce the maunder minimum , we decrease @xmath24 rapidly to a very low value in both the hemispheres .",
    "we have done this in the decaying phase of the last sunspot cycle before the maunder minimum .",
    "then we keep @xmath24 at a low value for around 1 year and then we again increase it slowly to the usual value but at different rates in two hemispheres . in northern hemisphere , @xmath24 is increased at a slightly lower rate than southern hemisphere . note that we have varied only @xmath24 and no other parameters of the model .    in the next step ,",
    "we have included the effect of the fluctuations in the  process of generating the poloidal field along with the fluctuations of meridional circulation .",
    "as the  process involves randomness , the poloidal field at the end of a cycle will be different from the average field obtained in the mean field model .",
    "choudhuri et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have proposed that the cumulative effect of the fluctuations of the  process can be taken into account just by multiplying a random factor @xmath34 with the poloidal fields above @xmath35 at every minimum of the solar cycle .",
    "the poloidal fields below @xmath35 are left unchanged as it is believed that these are from the earlier cycles .",
    "we follow the same algorithm here .",
    "hence , we decreased the poloidal field by a factor @xmath34 along with @xmath24 .",
    "we run the model for different values of @xmath34 from 0 to 1 at each value of @xmath24 from a very low value to the average value .",
    "then we find out the critical values of @xmath24 and the corresponding @xmath34 factor for which we get a maunder - like minimum .",
    "we have also checked whether a strong fluctuation of  can produce a maunder - like grand minimum in the low - diffusivity model . to do this ,",
    "we have decreased @xmath27 at the same ratio as we have done earlier in the high - diffusivity model .",
    "however , here we do not include the effect of fluctuations of the polar field along with the fluctuations of meridional circulation as we have done earlier .",
    "first , we discuss the results of fitting the periods of last the @xmath0 cycles by varying @xmath24 in the high - diffusivity model . the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fit23 ] .",
    "it may be noted that we have not tried to match the periods exactly . in order to show how good the theoretical periods",
    "have been matched with that of the observed periods , we have shown the scatter diagram between them in fig .",
    "[ fit23](c ) ( linear corr",
    "= @xmath36 ) . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fit23](a ) shows the variation of @xmath24 required to fit the periods of the last @xmath0 cycles . as this @xmath24 determines the period of the solar cycle ,",
    "this may be taken as an indicative of how @xmath24 had varied over the last few centuries .",
    "it appears from the same figure that during cycles 110 , the meridional circulation had large variation with a timescale of around @xmath37  years . on the other hand , during cycles 1122 , the meridional circulation had relatively smaller variation with a timescale of around @xmath38  years . with the limited data we have",
    ", we can not say whether the behavior of cycles 110 is more typical in the long run or the behavior of cycles 1122 is more typical .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fit23](a ) , we can only surmise that the meridional circulation probably has long - time variations having large coherence time .",
    "indeed , karak & choudhuri ( 2010b ) have also assumed longer coherence time of the meridional circulation while studying the waldmeier effect .",
    "so just by fitting the periods of the last @xmath0 cycles data we get some idea about both the amplitude variation and the timescale of meridional circulation over the last few centuries .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ fit23](b ) , we show the theoretical sunspot series ( eruptions ) by the dashed line along with the observed sunspot series by the solid line .",
    "the theoretical sunspot series has been multiplied by a factor to match the observed value .",
    "it is very interesting to see that the amplitude of the theoretical sunspot cycle has a similar trend as that of the observed sunspot cycle . in order to see the correlation between the amplitudes of peak theoretical sunspot number and that of observed sunspot number",
    ", we have shown the scatter diagram between them in fig .",
    "[ fit23](d ) . we have found a significant correlation between these two ( having linear pearson s corr . coeff .",
    "= @xmath39 with a significance level of @xmath40 ) .",
    "this suggests that a major part of the fluctuations of the amplitude of the solar cycle may come from the fluctuations of meridional circulation .",
    "this is a very important result of this analysis .",
    "it is also interesting to see the results from the low - diffusivity model .",
    "we show the results of this analysis in fig  [ fitlow ] .",
    "the solid line in fig  [ fitlow](a ) shows the variation of @xmath27 over the last @xmath0 cycles required to fit the periods of the cycles .",
    "it may be noted that in this model the value of @xmath27 required to get an 11 year period is @xmath28 m  s@xmath8 .",
    "although the amplitude of  at the surface ( what in the previous model is @xmath24 ) is different than @xmath27 , this @xmath27 variation in fig  [ fitlow](a ) is similar to the previous result from the high - diffusivity model .",
    "therefore , the low - diffusivity model also gives a similar result of the amplitude variation and the timescale variation of meridional circulation .",
    "now let us see how the amplitude of the sunspot cycle responds with the amplitude of meridional circulation . in this model ,",
    "the magnetic energy density of the toroidal field ( @xmath41 ) at latitude @xmath37@xmath42 at the base of the convection zone is a measure of the sunspot number ( dikpati & charbonneau 1999 ) which we also have followed . in fig .",
    "[ fitlow](b ) , we have shown the theoretical sunspot number by the dashed line along with the observed sunspot number by the solid line .",
    "we see from this figure that the amplitudes of this theoretical sunspot number are not matching with the observed amplitudes .",
    "rather we have found a weak inverse correlation between these two amplitudes ( linear corr . coeff .",
    "= @xmath43 ) .",
    "now we explain the physics behind these two completely different results .",
    "it is well accepted that the period of the solar cycle is strongly determined by the value of @xmath24 .",
    "this is true in both the high - diffusivity model and the low - diffusivity model .",
    "however , the value of @xmath24 affects the amplitude of the solar cycle differently in these two models .",
    "this can be understood on the basis of the yeates et al .",
    "( 2008 ) study in the following way .",
    "we have seen that in these models , the toroidal field is generated by the stretching of the poloidal field in the tachocline .",
    "the production of this toroidal field is more if the poloidal field remains in the tachocline for a longer time and vice versa .",
    "however , the poloidal field diffuses during its transport through the convection zone . as a result ,",
    "if the diffusivity is very high , then much of the poloidal field diffuses away and very less amount of it reaches the tachocline to induct the toroidal field . therefore , when we decrease the value of @xmath24 in the high - diffusivity model to match the period of a longer cycle , the poloidal field gets more time to diffuse during its transport through the convection zone .",
    "this ultimately leads to a lesser generation of the toroidal field and hence the cycle becomes weaker . on the other hand ,",
    "when we increase the value of @xmath24 to match the period of a shorter cycle , the poloidal field does not get much time to diffuse in the convection zone .",
    "hence , it effectively gives rise to a stronger toroidal field and the cycle becomes stronger .",
    "consequently , in the high - diffusivity model , we get weaker amplitudes for longer periods ( having lower values of meridional circulation ) and vice versa .",
    "this is exactly observed in the observational data ( see figure 1(c ) of charbonneau & dikpati 2000 ) . however",
    ", this is not the case in the low - diffusivity model .",
    "this is because in this model the diffusive decay of the fields is not much important . as a result",
    ", the slower meridional circulation means that the poloidal field remains in the tachocline for a longer time and therefore it produces more toroidal field , giving rise to a strong cycle .",
    "ultimately , we get stronger amplitudes for longer periods ( having lower values of meridional circulation ) and vice versa which is not observed .",
    "therefore , we do not get a correct correlation between the amplitudes of theoretical sunspot number and that of observed sunspot number when only the meridional circulation is varied .          in fig .",
    "[ mm ] , we show the theoretical results covering the maunder minimum episode from the high - diffusivity model . fig .",
    "[ mm](a ) , shows the maximum amplitude of meridional circulation @xmath24 varied over this period in two hemispheres .",
    "the key point to note is that in our calculation we have increased @xmath24 differently in two hemispheres in the recovery phase . in northern hemisphere ( shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ mm](a ) ) , @xmath24 is increased slightly at a lower rate than southern hemisphere ( shown by the dashed line ) .",
    "consideration of this north ",
    "south asymmetry of  may be justified .",
    "it is unlikely that the meridional circulation decreased by the same amount in both hemispheres . even if it did , it is very unlikely that it again increased at the same rate .",
    "in addition , recent observational studies @xcite of surface  give the evidence of hemispheric asymmetry of  which can lead to the asymmetry in solar activity @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ mm](b ) , we show the butterfly diagram of sunspot numbers , whereas in fig .",
    "[ mm](c ) , we show the variation of total sunspot number along with the individual sunspot numbers in two hemispheres ( see the caption of fig .",

    "we have taken the beginning of the year to be 1635 .",
    "note that in figs .",
    "[ mm](b ) and ( c ) , the sunspot number at the beginning of the maunder minimum suddenly falls to zero value , whereas in the recovery phase , it increases slowly .",
    "in addition , the north  south asymmetry of sunspot number observed in the last phase of the maunder minimum is remarkably reproduced . in order to compare our results with the observational results",
    ", the readers may compare our fig .",
    "[ mm](b ) with figure 1(a ) of sokoloff & nesme - ribes ( 1994 ) and fig .",
    "[ mm](c ) with figure 1 of usoskin et al .",
    "we also show the energy density of the toroidal field calculated at latitude 15@xmath42 at the bottom of the convection zone in fig .",
    "[ mm](d ) . here , the rapid decrease of the @xmath24 to a critical value ( @xmath29  m  s@xmath8 ) from its average value ( @xmath25 m  s@xmath8 ) triggers a maunder minimum",
    ". however , this critical value depends on the value of the diffusivity ( and also on the alpha coefficient ) as it determines the growth rate @xcite . indeed",
    ", we do not know the exact value of diffusivity in the convection zone ; we only have some idea of its order of magnitude estimate . therefore ,",
    "if we take a slightly higher ( lower ) value of diffusivity , then we can reproduce the maunder minimum even at a higher ( lower ) critical value of @xmath24 .",
    "similar to choudhuri & karak ( 2009 ) , we calculate the magnetic field in the solar wind at a distance where it becomes radial . fig .",
    "[ wind ] shows this as a function of time .",
    "this clearly shows the periodic behavior with a period slightly longer than the usual @xmath3  year period .",
    "this periodic variation explains the observed oscillation in cosmogenic isotope data .",
    "the cosmogenic isotope study suggests that there were around @xmath44 grand minima in last 11,000 years having different duration @xcite . now in our simulation ,",
    "the length of a grand minimum has been determined by the time for which the value of meridional circulation remains at a low value and the rate at which meridional circulation is increased after the grand minimum has started . in this way , we are able to reproduce any grand minimum of any length .",
    "we have no knowledge of how  varied during the maunder minimum . in the above calculation , at the beginning of the maunder minimum ,",
    "we have decreased @xmath24 rapidly to a low value , whereas in the recovery phase , we increased it rather slowly .",
    "however , our results are completely independent of the way how we increase @xmath24 in the recovery phase .",
    "for example , the variation of @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ mc ] reproduces an exactly similar maunder minimum what we have evinced in fig .",
    "[ mm](b ) . here",
    "we underscore that if the  falls very slowly to a low value , then we do not get the sudden fall of sunspot number at the beginning of the maunder minimum . however ,",
    "if we are to believe the observational results of usoskin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , then it says that at the beginning of the maunder minimum , solar activity decreased abruptly , but built up gradually .",
    "this strongly suggests that the toroidal field decreased suddenly below a certain value which triggered the maunder minimum and then it took sometime to regain its usual value .",
    "if this sudden fall of the toroidal field is due to the reduction of meridional circulation , then it probably indicates that the meridional circulation dropped rapidly to a very low value at the beginning .",
    "however , it does not indicate anything about the rate of recovery of meridional circulation .",
    "let us now discuss the physics of getting the maunder minimum in this model .",
    "the meridional circulation affects the generation not only of the toroidal field but also that of the poloidal field ( wang & sheeley 2003 ; baumann et al .",
    "poloidal field generated at the surface through the decay of sunspots is advected by meridional circulation ( and also diffuses ) toward the pole where it cancels the opposite polarity field of the previous cycle to give rise to a large - scale polar field for the new cycle ( stenflo 1972 ; wang et al .",
    "1989 ; dikpati et al .",
    "2004 ) . at the maximum phase of the solar cycle , lots of sunspot eruptions go on at the surface and at the same time , these sunspots decay in a short timescale to generate the poloidal field . now at this time , if the amplitude of meridional circulation decreases strongly , then the poloidal field which is being generated at the surface at low latitude is not able to move toward the pole to cancel the opposite polarity field of the previous cycle",
    "rather a part of it diffuses away toward the opposite hemisphere to cancel out the opposite polarity field .",
    "therefore , it is not able to generate a large amount of the polar field for the next cycle . naturally , the decrease of meridional circulation causes a weaker polar field ( see also wang & sheeley 2003 and baumann et al .",
    "2004 for details ) .",
    "this weaker polar field gives a weaker toroidal field ( choudhuri et al .",
    "in addition , according to the discussion of the previous section the lower value of meridional circulation means more time for the diffusive decay of the poloidal field during its transport through the convection zone , leading to less generation of the toroidal field in the tachocline .",
    "this weak toroidal field is insufficient to produce sunspot eruptions ( dsilva & choudhuri 1993 ; fan et al .",
    "1993 ; caligari et al . 1995 ) and therefore triggers a grand minimum .",
    "however , when the amplitude of meridional circulation is increased again , the poloidal field does not get much time to diffuse and therefore the generation of the toroidal field is more . at some point ,",
    "the toroidal field exceeds the critical value of producing sunspots eruption . in this way",
    ", it recovers from the grand minimum state .",
    "the flux tube simulations ( choudhuri 1989 ; dsilva & choudhuri 1993 ; fan et al . 1993 ) suggest that the initial magnetic field inside the flux tube has to be of order @xmath45 g and the sunspot eruption takes place only when the toroidal field reaches this value . in this model also , the sunspot eruptions take place if the value of the toroidal field exceeds this critical value ( nandy & choudhuri 2001 ; chatterjee et al .",
    "2004 ) . during the maunder minimum the toroidal field at the base of the convection zone was below this value and",
    "there was no eruption .",
    "however , the weak solar cycles continued during this period .",
    "note that in the absence of sunspot eruptions , the usual babcock  leighton process does not work .",
    "however , the toroidal field advects ( and also diffuses ) toward the upper part of the convection zone by the upward meridional circulation . in this case",
    ", the @xmath4 coefficient in our equation acts like a traditional mean field @xmath4 @xcite . in modeling the distribution of a large - scale solar magnetic field ,",
    "choudhuri & dikpati ( 1999 ) have shown that the poloidal field has two sources  the babcock ",
    "leighton mechanism and a @xmath4-effect working on a weaker subsurface toroidal field . during the maunder minimum ",
    "when there was no sunspot  the dynamo continued due to the @xmath4-effect operating on the weaker toroidal field . also the @xmath4-effects operating in the tachocline ( dikpati & gilman 2001 ; bonanno et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) or the alpha effect arising due to the buoyancy instability at the base of the convection zone @xcite may play a role in this episode . in this calculation , however , we do not consider these @xmath4-effects .    ) and the poloidal field reduction factor ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the line shows the values of these parameters which give maunder - like grand minima .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    now we include the effect of fluctuations of the polar field along with the fluctuations of meridional circulation in this model .",
    "we have seen earlier that the strong decrease of @xmath24 can lead to a grand minimum .",
    "however , in that case , its value had to be reduced to a significantly low value which may be a bit surprising .",
    "we have mentioned that the polar field fluctuates randomly as its generation mechanism ",
    "the  process involves randomness .",
    "therefore , it is important to include these fluctuations along with the fluctuations of meridional circulation in modeling grand minima .",
    "we find that if we decrease the polar field by a factor of @xmath34 , then even at a moderately lower value of @xmath24 , we are able to reproduce maunder - like grand minima . we have repeated our calculation at different values of @xmath24 and @xmath34 and found that for each value of @xmath24 there is a corresponding value of @xmath34 which can give a maunder - like grand minimum .",
    "these values are shown by the line in fig .",
    "the values lower than these @xmath34 s give grand minima longer than the maunder minimum ( like sprer minimum ) , whereas larger values give grand minima shorter than the maunder minimum .",
    "these two regions are indicated in fig .",
    "we mention that choudhuri & karak ( 2009 ) have reproduced the maunder minimum just by decreasing the poloidal field to @xmath46 ( actually @xmath47 = @xmath48 and @xmath49 = @xmath50 ) of its original value keeping @xmath24 unchanged .",
    "however , in the present calculations , we have to reduce @xmath24 to around @xmath51 m  s@xmath8 along with the poloidal field reduction to @xmath46 .",
    "this is because in those calculations we had reduced the toroidal field slightly along with the change of the poloidal field to compensate for the overlap between cycles .",
    "here we have not done this kind of questionable change of toroidal field .",
    "additionally , here the values of @xmath4 and @xmath18 are different than those calculations giving a different dynamo growth rate .",
    "now let us discuss the results of the low - diffusivity model briefly . in this model",
    ", lesser circulation speed means that the poloidal field gets more time to produce the toroidal field in the tachocline .",
    "thus smaller @xmath24 gives more toroidal field and finally stronger cycle .",
    "consequently , if the dynamo is in the advection - dominated regime , it does not produce any grand minimum rather it produces stronger cycles .",
    "this is exactly what we find in our simulation .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ maundlow ] . in this figure , panel ( a ) shows the variation of @xmath27 during the maunder minimum episode , whereas panel ( b ) shows the theoretical sunspot number with time .",
    "we see that the sunspot number has rather increased when the meridional circulation is decreased rapidly from its average value ( @xmath28 m  s@xmath8 ) to a very low value ( @xmath52 m  s@xmath8 ) .",
    "however , for one cycle ( around 16801690 and also around 17251735 ) after two cycles of the strong reduction of @xmath27 we get a reduction of sunspot number .",
    "this is due to the decrease of the polar field during the low value of @xmath24 as explained earlier .",
    "it may be noted that in this model , the decrease of the polar field affects the sunspot cycle of two cycles later ( see figure 9 of jiang et al .",
    "we may point out that if we increase @xmath27 to a very high value for several years , then we may get a maunder - like minimum in this model .",
    "however , in this case , the cycle periods will be unrealistically short and no observation during the maunder minimum validates this .",
    "we have studied the importance of meridional circulation on the period and the amplitude of solar cycle and also on the maunder - like grand minimum in two different regimes of a flux transport dynamo model , namely , advection - dominated and diffusion - dominated .",
    "first , we have approximately modeled the periods of the last @xmath0 solar cycles by varying @xmath24 alone . from this study",
    ", we get some idea about both the amplitude variation and the time scale of the  over the last few centuries .",
    "moreover , we have seen that when we match the periods of these cycles by varying @xmath24 in the high - diffusivity model , most of the cycle amplitudes also get modeled up to some extent .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a major part of the fluctuations of solar cycle amplitude may come from the  fluctuations . in the low - diffusivity model , the cycle amplitudes do not get modeled at all when we repeat the same analysis .",
    "we have also shown the possibility of producing ( or not producing ) a maunder - like minimum in two models by varying the meridional circulation speed . to do this , we have assumed that at the beginning of the maunder minimum the amplitude of meridional circulation largely reduced and then after a few years it increased again .",
    "it may be noted that this is not an ad hoc assumption .",
    "there are several independent arguments which support our assumption .",
    "first , wang & sheeley ( 2003 ) used the flux transport model to simulate the evolution of the sun s magnetic dipole moment , polar fields , and open flux under maunder minimum conditions and suggested that the poleward surface flow speed was reduced from @xmath53 m  s@xmath8 to @xmath29 m  s@xmath8 during that time .",
    "second , the flux transport dynamo model predicts an inverse correlation between the meridional circulation speed and the cycle period ( wang et al .",
    "1991 ; dikpati & charbonneau 1999 ) . on the other hand , from the study of @xmath2c data during the maunder minimum , miyahara et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( also miyahara et al .",
    "2010 ) reported that the periods of the solar cycle were longer compared to the usual 11  year period .",
    "now , if the flow speed determines the solar cycle period , then it indicates that the meridional circulation speed during the maunder minimum was lower than the usual value .",
    "third , while simulating sun s large - scale magnetic field during cycles 1322 , wang et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have shown that the regular polarity reversal is obtained only if the flow speed is assumed to be correlated with the cycle amplitude ( see also hathaway et al .",
    "2003 ) . on the other hand , yeates et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have shown that the cycle amplitude is positively correlated with the speed of meridional circulation in the diffusion - dominated regime .",
    "now , both beer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and miyahara et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that the amplitudes of solar cycle were weaker during the maunder minimum .",
    "therefore , if flow speed determines the cycle amplitude , then it probably indicates that the meridional circulation during the maunder minimum was weaker than the usual one .",
    "last , using the low order dynamo model , passos & lopes ( 2009 ) suggest that the stochastic fluctuations in the @xmath4-effect can not trigger a grand minimum rather they argued that the decrease in the amplitude of the meridional flow can do so .",
    "we have no idea why the meridional circulation dropped to a very low value .",
    "therefore , our assumption may be a bit questionable at the present understanding .",
    "however , this assumption enables us to reproduce most of the important features of the maunder minimum remarkably well .",
    "it may be noted that to produce a maunder - like minimum in our model , we did not have to decrease @xmath24 to an unrealistically low value ( @xmath29  m  s@xmath8 is required here ) .",
    "we emphasize that we can reproduce these results only if the dynamo is in the diffusion - dominated regime .",
    "however , recently several independent works on the parity ( chatterjee et al . 2004 ; hotta & yokoyama 2010b ) , the hemispheric coupling ( chatterjee & choudhuri 2006 ; goel & choudhuri 2009 ) , the correlation between the polar field at the minimum and the sunspot number in the next cycle ( jiang et al . 2007 ) , the correct value of the polar field ( hotta & yokoyama 2010a ) , the correlation between the flow speed and the cycle amplitude ( wang et al . 2002 ; hathaway et al . 2003 ; yeates et al .",
    "2008 ) and the waldmeier effect ( karak & choudhuri 2010b ) suggest that the solar dynamo is working in the diffusion - dominated regime and not in the advection - dominated regime . in addition , from the low - order time - delay dynamo model ,",
    "wilmot - smith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have shown that the irregular activity and the maunder - like events are more readily excited in the diffusion - dominated regime and not in the advection - dominated regime .",
    "however , we are not pointing out that the decrease of meridional circulation is the `` only '' possibility to produce grand minima , but the abrupt decrease of the polar field due to fluctuations in the babcock ",
    "leighton process may be a valid possibility @xcite .",
    "as the measurement of either the meridional circulation or the polar field during the maunder minimum is unavailable , we do not know which possibility is correct . in this paper",
    ", we have adequately shown that a large fluctuation of meridional circulation alone can lead to a grand minimum .    _",
