    "countless students in introductory physics learn that the `` exchange of virtual particles '' is responsible for the fundamental forces of nature .",
    "several popular introductory textbooks contain diagrams which sketch how classical particle exchange could plausibly explain the qualitative nature of repulsive forces.@xcite furthermore , some texts even attempt to construct analogies for how attractive forces could arise from complicated exchanges of classical objects.@xcite in this paper , we wish to address the gaping hole in the literature regarding how such pictures may be quantitatively useful in understanding the connection between fundamental interactions and momentum transfer through mediating particles .",
    "just as physical theories are only useful within certain domains of validity , analogies are only helpful until their meanings are stretched to a point at which the usefulness breaks down . to properly analyze fundamental interactions , the methods of quantum field theory provide the tools necessary for obtaining quantitatively accurate results . ref .",
    "provides a particularly illuminating discussion of how gravitational , electrostatic and nuclear potentials arise as either attractive or repulsive interactions by using the path integral formualtion of quantum field theory .",
    "additionally , by casually invoking the energy - time version of the heisenberg uncertainty principle , one may obtain surprisingly accurate information regarding the force laws resulting from electromagnetic and nuclear interactions.@xcite the focus of the present work is not to require an idealized analysis within classical mechanics to describe the nature of fundamental interactions , but to explore how effective forces between particles which are spatially separated _ can _ arise within classical dynamics .",
    "a student needs only very basic tools to explore the implications of a particular particle exchange model . with easily acquired numerical results",
    ", an advanced student may apply the mathematical analysis required to obtain both exact and asymptotic results .",
    "the goal of the present work is to present a quantitative approach , accessible at both introductory and advanced levels , which thoroughly analyzes a particular model for interactions based on classical physics .",
    "in particular , we consider a system of two massive particles , each of mass @xmath0 , which interact with each other via the exchange of two mediating particles , each of mass @xmath1 , which are taken to always move at speed @xmath2 and interact with the heavier particles through inelastic collisions , always emerging with speed @xmath2 relative to a stationary lab ( or `` ground '' ) frame .",
    "though this model is admittedly artificial compared to the quantum field theories describing the known fundamental interactions , the reasoning required for a careful , quantitative analysis are quite useful in understanding the realistic interactions that do occur in nature through mediating quantum fields.@xcite    a notable shortcoming of the classical particle - exchange analogy is its inability to describe attractive forces.@xcite while it is possible to invoke quantum fluctuations in energy to explain attractive nuclear forces in a qualitative manner,@xcite we emphasize that attractive interactions emerge naturally from classical scalar field theory.@xcite such a rigorous discussion of the origin of attractive forces implicitly requires a discussion of quantum theory , as these interactions rely on the wave - like nature of matter .",
    "consequently , such treatment is beyond the scope of the present work , as we wish to present a model which may be thoroughly analyzed classically .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present a model for classical particle exchange and explore some basic consequences through simulations and physical reasoning , both of which are appropriate for students in introductory physics courses .",

    "sec : summary ] .",
    "we wish to investigate the classical picture of particle exchange as a mechanism for interaction between two massive particles .",
    "we imagine two particles each of mass @xmath3 exchanging small particles , each of mass @xmath4 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : collisionfig ] .",
    "the analogy is often made to a pair of ice skaters ( or rollerbladers ) tossing a ball back and forth.@xcite each time one skater catches the ball and throws it back , a small amount of momentum is imparted to the skater , resulting in an effective repulsive force between the skaters which is mediated by the ball being tossed .",
    "we construct a quantitative model for this type of interaction by taking the smaller particle s velocity to be a constant , given speed @xmath5 .",
    "we choose the label @xmath2 with no reference whatsoever to the speed of light , though we will see that our @xmath2 plays a role in our model which is rather similar to that of the actual speed of light in electromagnetism , allowing us to explore a sort of `` non - relativistic '' limit of the model for speeds @xmath6 . in order to keep the system s center of mass at rest",
    ", we shall consider a symmetric setup in which two small particles are exchanged .",
    "when the smaller , mediating particles approach each other we assume that they pass through one another without interaction or collide elastically.@xcite     experience a repulsive `` force '' which is mediated by the exchange of a smaller particle of mass @xmath4 . ]    since the mediating particles always move at speed @xmath5 , the collisions involving the massive@xcite particles with the mediating particles would not result in momentum transfer if the collisions were elastic . to obtain nontrivial momentum transfer",
    ", we must consider inelastic collisions which result in an incremental increase in the system s kinetic energy after each collision .",
    "we shall explore whether the work required for this change in kinetic energy may be associated with an effective potential energy for the system . taking the large , right - moving particle to be moving at speed @xmath7 , momentum conservation applied to a single collision gives @xmath8 or @xmath9 . with repeated collisions of this form",
    ", the two massive particles will accelerate away from their common center of mass in a manner qualitatively similar to the motion experienced by two like charges placed near each other and released .",
    "we employ two approaches to investigate the quantitative nature of this effective force law .",
    "first , we simulate the system as described , obtaining numerically an effective force law which decreases as @xmath10 for small velocities @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the instantaneous separation between the two massive particles .",
    "second , the discrete sequence of collisions leads to a recursion relation which allows us to obtain a closed - form expression for @xmath13 , the separation distance immediately preceeding the @xmath14 collision . while exact , this closed - form expression for @xmath15 is less than transparent regarding the physics of the system . in the following section ,",
    "we apply continuum approximation to uncover the effective dynamics analytically in various limits .",
    "the full simulation consists of integrating the newtonian equations of motion for free particles moving at constant speeds and monitoring for a `` collision '' at which point each massive particle is given a boost in speed @xmath16 and the mediating particles are reflected with equal momenta in the opposite directions .",
    "letting @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) denote the position of the right - moving ( left - moving ) particle and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) its velocity , we consider the following initial conditions : @xmath21 the mediating particles are initially located at the origin and begin moving in opposite directions toward the massive particles at @xmath22 with speed @xmath5 . letting the positions of the mediating particles be given by @xmath23 for @xmath24 , it is an instructive exercise to numerically integrate the equations of motion @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 at @xmath28 . to monitor for collisions , at each time step @xmath29 we check for the following condition : @xmath30 indicating that the mediating particle nearest the @xmath31 particle has come within a small distance @xmath32 of the massive particle s location .",
    "when this occurs , we make the following adjustment to the equations of motion : @xmath33 indicating that a collision has occurred , resulting in momentum transfer .",

    "each collision is associated with transfer of momentum @xmath39 for @xmath6 , the massive particles do not move appreciably during one collision cycle .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the instantaneous separation distance between the massive particles .",
    "beginning with the mediating particles at the origin , one cycle requires each particle to cover a distance @xmath40 to collide with the massive particles and then another distance of @xmath40 to return to the origin .",
    "thus , a single collision cycle associated with a momentum transfer @xmath41 requires a time @xmath42 the average force experienced by each massive particle is then @xmath43 the validity of this crude estimate will be examined more carefully in the next section , but for now it serves to make the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : loglog ] appear rather plausible .",
    "one might worry about the implications of an inverse - linear force law , since this could potentially be associated with a logarithmic potential energy function , just as in the case of two uniformly charged wires of infinite length.@xcite in the case of point particles , the potential does not asymptotically approach a constant value at large distances and should result in ever - increasing speeds as the massive particles move farther away from each other .",
    "this does not appear consistent with the model , as the mechanism for momentum does not allow the mediating particles to travel faster than speed @xmath5 , so the speeds of the massive particles should be bounded by this limit .",
    "the resolution of this apparent paradox will be addressed below where we must refine the simulation method in order to access much longer times .",
    "the results so far suggest a disconnect between the low - energy behavior of the model and the high - energy `` speed limit '' of @xmath5 , which should be enforced by the mediating particles . to obtain some resolution",
    ", we must explore extremely large timescales , thus allowing the massive particles to approach high speeds , @xmath44 . because the time between subsequent collisions grows at an accelerated rate",
    "as the massive particles spread apart and speed up , the basic scheme outlined above becomes impractical .",
    "in fact , most of the computation is entirely unnecessary since all particles move with constant velocities until a collision occurs .",
    "starting from one collision event , the time for the next collision may be computed using the instantaneous velocities of all particles , and this process may be repeated .",
    "though the time between collisions grows rapidly , the computation time of this scheme grows linearly with number of collisions , not with the elapsed time as before .    to proceed ,",

    "[ fig : collisionfig ] . with both mediating particles at the origin and instantaneous separation @xmath15 between the outwardly moving massive particles ,",
