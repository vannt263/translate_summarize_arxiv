    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 be an open set with nonempty boundary @xmath4 . the _ distance function _ @xmath8 and the _ metric projection _",
    "@xmath9 are defined by @xmath10 the relation between the differentiability of the distance function and the number of elements of the metric projection is well - known ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.4.5 ) ) :    the distance function @xmath11 is differentiable at @xmath12 if and only if @xmath13 is a singleton .",
    "thus we define the singular set @xmath14 called _ medial axis _ or _ skeleton _ , by @xmath15 for a general open set @xmath0 , several properties of @xmath3 are known besides the above characterization : for example , the skeleton @xmath3 is @xmath16-rectifiable @xcite , in particular it has null lebesgue measure , and it has the same homotopy type as @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to characterize the set @xmath5 called _ ridge _ or _ cut locus _ , which is the closure of @xmath3 in @xmath0 .",
    "unlike the skeleton , properties of the cut locus crucially depend on the regularity of the boundary @xmath4 . especially , it is critical whether @xmath4 is of class @xmath16 or not .",
    "if the boundary is at least @xmath16 then the cut locus behaves rather well , in particular it still has null lebesgue measure @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the boundary is not @xmath16 then the cut locus may have positive lebesgue measure even when @xmath0 is a planer convex @xmath17-domain @xcite .",
    "another more basic knowledge of the cut locus in the @xmath16 case is the following characterization by radius of curvature of @xmath4 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) :    let @xmath4 be of class @xmath16",
    ". then @xmath18 if and only if @xmath13 is a singleton and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "here @xmath21 is the classical radius of ( inner ) curvature of @xmath4 at @xmath22 ( see remark [ remradcur ] ) .",
    "this result means that the radius of curvature of @xmath4 at the point in @xmath13 is essential whether @xmath11 is differentiable in a neighborhood of @xmath23 .",
    "the above theorem is already known : see for example @xcite which states and proves it in terms of principle curvature @xmath24 instead of radius of curvature @xmath25 ( for the minkowski distance ) .",
    "the main result of this paper is to characterize the cut locus @xmath5 for @xmath2-boundary by a kind of radius of curvature of the boundary . for a boundary of class less than @xmath16 we should extend the definition of radius of curvature @xmath25",
    "this can be easily archived for a general open set by using locally inner touching spheres ( see definition [ defradcur ] ) . unfortunately , by just this extension , the `` if '' part of the above characterization is not valid even in the @xmath17 case .",
    "indeed , the example provided in @xcite gives a counterexample .",
    "nevertheless , we can characterize the cut locus by taking a lower semicontinuous envelope of radius of curvature @xmath26 as given in definition [ defradcur ] .",
    "the main result of this paper is :    [ thm1 ] let @xmath4 be of class @xmath2",
    ". then @xmath18 if and only if @xmath13 is a singleton and @xmath27 , where @xmath20 .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 coincides with the usual radius of curvature when @xmath4 is of class @xmath16 thus this theorem is a generalization of the characterization of @xmath5 to the @xmath2 case .",
    "we emphasize that our proof quite differs from the @xmath16 case .",
    "the above characterization is proved by calculating second derivatives for @xmath16-domains .",
    "in contrast , our proof is more geometric and based on the conception of viscosity solution .",
    "the `` if '' part follows by proving its contrapositive . the inequality @xmath28 is obtained for @xmath29 by seeking a sequence in @xmath4 converging to @xmath22 such that any sphere with radius almost larger than @xmath30 can not touch @xmath4 on the sequence .",
    "such sequence is found in some hull of the image of the metric projection from a neighborhood of @xmath23 .",
    "the local @xmath2-graph representation of @xmath4 is used in our proof of this part .",
    "the `` only if '' part is proved by considering a semi - sphere in @xmath31 around @xmath23 slightly far from @xmath22 .",
    "it is proved that the image of the metric projection from the semi - sphere is a neighborhood of @xmath22 in @xmath4 by homotopic arguments .",
    "this implies the inequality @xmath27 .",
    "this part is proved for a wider class than @xmath2 ; for open sets such that all points of its boundary have non - spreading inner perpendicular ( see definition [ defnonsprper ] ) .    the cut locus has been studied in several settings .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein for more details .",
    "we emphasize that these results work for only regular domains , at least of class @xmath16 , and there are few results for domains of class less than @xmath16 .",
    "it is important to characterize the cut locus @xmath5 for general @xmath0 since the distance function is a very basic tool and the set @xmath31 is the largest open set where the distance function is of class @xmath2 . in addition , for general @xmath0 the distance function is a unique nonnegative viscosity solution to the dirichlet problem of the simplest eikonal equation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath32 since this is a first order equation , it is natural to know where the solution @xmath11 is of class @xmath2 .",
    "incidentally , the distance function measured by another suitable metric is also a viscosity solution to a more general hamilton - jacobi equation @xcite .",
    "thus our result would lead to improvement in the regularity theory of hamilton - jacobi equations on non - smooth domains .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "some notations and known results are prepared in  2 .",
    "theorem [ thm1 ] is proved in  3 .",
    "the proof is separated into the `` if '' part (  3.1 ) and the `` only if '' part (  3.2 ) .",
    "finally , we mention that our theorem is partially valid for some non - smooth domains but generally not valid even lipschitz in  4 .",
    "in this section , we prepare some notations and review known results .",
