    "the kondo effect , which was originally studied in dilute magnetic alloys , is a typical phenomenon caused by local electron correlation .",
    "recent progress on nano - processing techniques has enabled us to observe the kondo effect in quantum dot ( qd ) systems @xcite . since the qd system has many tunable parameters , various aspects of the kondo effect can be controlled . for instance , the multiorbital kondo effect realized in vertical qds @xcite and carbon - nanotube qds @xcite has attracted much interest . in particular , in a vertical qd , the confinement potential yields multiply degenerate single - particle qd energy levels called the fock - darwin states @xcite , which are regarded as effective orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "the degeneracy of the qd states in the confinement potential can be controlled with external magnetic fields .",
    "the introduction of the orbital splitting of the qd energy levels realizes a crossover from the su(4 ) to the su(2 ) kondo effect , which results in characteristic transport properties @xcite . in the su(4 ) kondo effect , a higher kondo temperature than that in the su(2 ) kondo effect was observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "spin - dependent current in metallic leads is another interesting topic in relation to qd systems .",
    "recently , there have been a number of experimental studies of qd systems coupled to ferromagnetic leads in the context of spintronics @xcite .",
    "the splitting and restoration of the kondo peak has been observed in experiments on a @xmath0 qd system @xcite and a semiconductor qd system , which are coupled to ferromagnetic leads @xcite .",
    "there have been extensive theoretical studies on a single - orbital qd coupled to two ferromagnetic leads @xcite .",
    "when the spin polarization of the two ferromagnetic leads is parallel , the kondo effect caused by the spin degrees of freedom is suppressed even in the absence of magnetic fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the kondo effect remains when the spin polarization of the two ferromagnetic leads is antiparallel @xcite .",
    "these results motivated us to investigate a multiorbital qd coupled to ferromagnetic leads .",
    "one can expect that the interplay between the spin polarization and the multiorbital effects causes characteristic features of the kondo effect and the related transport properties .",
    "for example , in a two - orbital qd coupled to ferromagnetic leads , the appearance of the underscreening kondo effect was discussed @xcite . in carbon nanotube",
    "qd , the influence of ferromagnetic leads on the shot noise was analyzed @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we calculate the single - particle excitation spectra ( spes ) of the localized electron in the qd and the conductance .",
    "the spes for several spin polarization values are discussed in connection with the splitting of the qd energy levels obtained by the poor man s scaling approach @xcite .",

    "it is considered that this is a kondo resonance caused by the orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied , the energy levels of the qd split and the kondo effect disappears .",

    "we have shown that in the p configuration the orbital kondo effect remains , while the spin kondo effect is suppressed . in magnetic fields",

    "this kondo effect can be possibly observed in experiments . in the ap configuration the spin kondo effect remains , while the orbital kondo effect is suppressed in magnetic fields .",
    "we have demonstrated that the change ratio in the conductance between the ap and p configurations can be controlled by an external magnetic field . in a typical two - orbital qd coupled to ni ferromagnetic leads , the change ratio of the conductance is larger than that in a single - orbital qd system .",
