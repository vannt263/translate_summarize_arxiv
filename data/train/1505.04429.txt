    "interacting galaxy pairs have been actively studied both observationally and numerically over the past few decades ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; among many others ) .",
    "while the effects of galaxy mergers have been more intensely studied ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the interest in a whole variety of interactions , including flybys and distant encounters ( before or without mergers ) , is growing only recently ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , @xcite presented a unified picture on the evolution of galaxy morphology and luminosity through distant interactions and mergers by analyzing the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) samples .",
    "in particular , they found the strong dependence of galaxy morphology on the local environment set up by the nearest neighbor galaxy .",
    "it was claimed that hydrodynamic effects of cold gas as well as hot diffuse halo gas play an important role in the evolution of galaxy color and star formation activity .",
    "it was also shown that galaxy@xmath2galaxy encounters are very important in a cluster environment in star formation quenching through hydrodynamic interactions of late - type galaxies ( ltgs ) with cluster early - type galaxies ( etgs ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "so far , however , the overall effects of hot halo gas on galaxy evolution during various interactions have not been well understood .",
    "they can be tackled with the use of hydrodynamical models that include both cold and hot gas .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the role of hot gas in major mergers of disk galaxies , including for the first time a gradually cooling hot gas halo in the galactic - scale simulations .",
    "they showed that the hot gas component affects the star formation rates ( sfrs ) , the efficiency of the starburst , and the kinematics and internal structure of the merger remnants . in a subsequent study ( @xcite )",
    ", they also examined the effects of hot gas on disk thickening in minor mergers .",
    "they found that a cooling hot halo acts to reduce thickening by re - forming a massive thin disk in the post - merger .",
    "these studies have addressed that the results of interactions can be significantly affected by a hot gas halo component .    in order to further investigate the effects of hot halo gas in a wide range of interactions",
    ", we have been performing a series of @xmath0-body / hydrodynamic simulations , including a cooling diffuse hot gas halo in our galaxy models .",
    "we presented the results of the first set of simulations in @xcite ( hereafter paper  i ) . in that work ,",
    "we tested different density profiles for the gas halo with varying mass and initial spin in our milky way galaxy@xmath2like models and examined how the adopted gas halos create differences in the evolution of the isolated galaxies , particularly in the gas dissipation and the star formation activity in the disk .    in the current work ,",
    "we perform a set of simulations of interactions between an etg and an ltg .",
    "this work is motivated by the observational study by @xcite , where some interesting examples of etgs having a late - type neighbor were presented , such as a blue elliptical - looking galaxy with strong star formation at its center , and a red galaxy having spiral - looking arms ( see figure  4 of their paper ) . in this work",
    "we aim to provide a set of simulated interacting galaxy systems that can be compared with observations in the follow - up studies .",
    "our study focuses on , for the first time , the effects of hot halo gas during distant encounters on the changes of galactic properties .",
    "specifically , we intend to investigate whether and how the presence of a hot gas halo component can cause differences in the star formation activities , the development and location of the tidal bridge , and the amount and dynamics of the material transferring through the bridge to the etg , as in the examples mentioned above , with a fixed set of orbital parameters",
    ".    we will continue to study more cases of various interactions in different environments , emphasizing the role of hot halo gas in follow - up studies .",
    "for example , we plan to work on galaxy interactions in a rich galaxy cluster environment and investigate star formation quenching and the morphology transformation of ltgs influenced by the hot halo gas of neighboring etgs , as well as the hot cluster gas .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our initial galaxy models and the model parameters in section  2 , and the simulation code used for this work in section  3 . in section  4 , we present our simulation results of the distant encounters , explaining the orbital parameters , the evolution , and the star formation activities .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our results in section  5 .",
    "we use four different galaxy models for this work , among which two are ltg models  l and lh , and the other two are etg models  e and eh ( table  1 ) .",
    "we generate the models by using the zeno software package ( @xcite ) .",
    "zeno allows one to construct multiple spherical and disk components of a galaxy system in mutual equilibrium with user - specified density profiles in collisionless or gaseous form .",

    "the cold gas can flow though this channel and is not blocked by shocks because the shocks exist parallel to the cold gas bridge .",
    "( we have checked that the positions of the shocks in this run and in run eh - lh , which strongly determine the subsequent evolution , are unchanged in different - resolution runs .",
    "we present the high - resolution simulations in appendix  c. )                              figure  2 ( bottom two rows ) shows the four snapshots from run  eh - lh , where both etg and ltg possess hot gas in their surrounding halos ( red and pink points , respectively ) .",
    "the old disk stars evolve in the same way as in the two previous runs at all times , but the cold gas evolves in a unique way , being affected by the gas halos . at @xmath118  gyr , a large - scale shock is formed between the two hot gas halos ( bottom - left panel ) . by this time",
    ", some disk gas at the outskirt has been ionized and scattered into the halo because of the hot halo gas of its own galaxy .",
    "in addition , the gas disk in this run has dissipated more quickly than the other two runs and produced more stars because of the compression exerted by its halo ( see paper  i for more details ) , before the gas halo of lh is affected by the collision with the gas halo of eh . at later times ( @xmath111  =  5 through 7  gyr ) , the gas disk does not develop a strong bridge as in the other runs , and almost no cold gas is transferred to eh .",
    "some halo gas particles of lh cool down to the disk and then turn into stars .",
    "the total mass of these stars formed out of the original halo gas of lh is less than @xmath1  1  % of that of the stars generated out of the original disk gas ; they are found at the central part of the disk .",
    "figure  3 ( bottom panel ) shows that the total mass of the young stars increases rapidly near the closest approach but slows down after a couple of gigayears .",
    "these young stars are all found on the disk of lh , not within eh .",
    "figure  8 displays the distribution of the disk particles . at @xmath122 5",
    "gyr , the young stars formed since the closest approach ( green points ) appear along the bridge , but are less extended compared to run  eh - l ; the gas bridge does not grow beyond the line of zero gravitational acceleration . at @xmath122 6 and 7  gyr ,",
    "some old stars ( orange points ) are seen transferred to eh .",
    "however , no young stars and only a little non - star - forming gas ( blue points ) are captured by eh .",
    "the total masses of the star and gas particles transferred to eh are presented in figure  5 ( bottom row ) .",
    "the amount of the old stars transferred to the early - type neighbor is similar to ( a little bit more than ) those in the previous runs .",
    "but the total mass of the cold gas moved to eh is much less than that in the other two runs .",
    "the local gas density and the gas temperature are shown in figure  9 .",
    "the discontinuities of the gas quantities are seen at the shock . as lh turns around eh ( middle row ) , the inner trailing shock propagates toward the center of eh before the cold gas tidal bridge starts to extend toward eh , blocking its motion to the center of eh . while the cold disk has been already dissipated a lot by this time through star formation",
    ", the blocking by the shock further hinders the growth of the cold gas bridge and ionizes it .",
    "the shock is later completely wound around eh and makes a spiral pattern in the hot halo gas ( bottom row ) .",
    "we present the sfrs in the three runs in figure  10 . in run  e - l ( top panel ) ,",
    "the sfr ( blue solid line ) , which is the sum of the sfrs from all gas particles originally set as the disk gas , rapidly increases right after the closest approach at @xmath109  gyr ( marked by a vertical dotted line ) .",
    "this compares with a gradual decline of sfr of the corresponding isolated l ( black dashed line ) .",
    "the value at the first peak of the blue line at @xmath111  =  4.95  gyr is 0.46 @xmath123 , which is about six times the value of the isolated galaxy at the same instant .",
    "the excess of the sfr lasts until @xmath124  8  gyr .    in run",
    "eh - l ( middle panel ) , the sfr ( blue line ) also abruptly exceeds that of the isolated galaxy  l ( black line ) right after the closest approach .",
    "the excess is a little greater and lasts longer than that in run  e - l .",
    "the sfr at the first peak is 0.5  @xmath123 at @xmath125  gyr , which is about seven times that of the isolated galaxy  l. ( we neglect the sfrs of the halo gas particles of the etg model eh because they are very small , although not always zero , with a maximum value of 0.018 @xmath123 ) .",
    "this implies that the enhanced star formation in this run is due to the compression of the gas disk through the collision with the gas halo of eh .",
    "although some of the disk gas particles are heated and stripped , the compression by the shock initiated during the collision is mainly responsible for the cold gas having a higher sfr . among the star - forming gas particles of l ,",
    "some are captured by eh after the encounter .",
    "the total sfr of the gas particles transferred to eh is shown with the cyan shade for @xmath114 . some non - star - forming disk gas transferred to eh also turns into star - forming gas particles later , when they gather densely enough to satisfy the conditions for star formation .",
    "these particles lead to the increase of the shaded region around @xmath111 = 7  gyr .    in run  eh - lh ( bottom panel ) , the sfr ( blue line ) also exceeds that of the isolated galaxy  lh ( black line ) but much more greatly than in the other two runs , with the sfr of 0.81  @xmath123 at the first peak at @xmath126  gyr .",
    "the maximum value of the sfr reaches to 1.033  @xmath123 at @xmath127  gyr . unlike in the others ,",
    "the excess ( over the black line ) begins earlier at about @xmath111 = 4  gyr , somewhat before the closest approach , from the onset of the collision between the two gas halos .",
    "the shock - compressed gas halo of the ltg consequently delivers the effects onto the cold disk , raising the sfr since @xmath128   4  gyr .",
    "the great excess on the sfr near the closest approach indicates the strong compression from the shock generated by the collision .",
    "compared with the sfr of the isolated l , the sfr of the isolated lh is generally higher , mainly due to the compression exerted by the gas halo of lh ; the direct contribution from the original halo gas particles of lh to the total sfr is small ( at most about @xmath129 or less in the total sfr of lh ) .",
    "using @xmath0-body / sph simulations , we studied distant encounters between an etg and an ltg for a case of the closest approach distance of about 100  kpc with the mass ratio of the etg to ltg of 2:1 .",
    "we performed three comparison simulations that adopt galaxy models having or not having a hot gas halo , keeping all of the other parameters fixed .",
    "we summarize our key findings in each run as follows , focusing on the mass transfer of the disk materials to the etg and the star formation enhancement that is due to the encounter .",
    "e - l case + a large amount of cold gas is transferred from l to e , but it does not contain star - forming gas .",
    "the cold gas flows through the gas bridge and dynamically follows the motion of accreted old disk stars . because there is no compression of the cold gas by shock , no new stars form along the tidal bridge .",
    "thus , the etg accretes cold gas and old disk stars but no young stars nor star - forming gas out of the ltg .",
    "the accreted cold gas and old disk stars orbit around the center of e. the sfr of l in run  e - l increases abruptly right after the closest approach .",
    "eh - l case + near the closest approach , a shock forms along the cold disk gas tidal bridge , and new stars form along the bridge .",
    "the strength of this shock is seen from the offset between the tidal bridge that consists of the old disk stars and that consisting of the young stars and the cold gas .",
    "a very important feature of this type of interaction is that a channel for the cold gas toward the center of eh is created right after the closet approach .",
    "this channel is developed between the inner trailing shock wound around eh taken over by the supersonic motion of l and the preceding shock that appears due to the cold gas tidal bridge .",
    "the cold gas can flow almost radially through this channel and is not blocked by shocks because the shocks exist parallel to the cold gas tidal bridge .",
    "the cold gas flowing to eh contains some star - forming gas .",
    "some of the non - star - forming gas transferred to eh later turns into stars as well . as a result",
    ", eh can accrete the cold disk gas , including some star - forming gas , _ at its center _ in this particular run , and also accrete the old and young disk stars _ around the center_. some of the young stars are found at the center , as well .",
    "the sfr of l in this run also increases rapidly right after the closest approach .",
    "the increase is greater than that in run  e - l .",
    "then , the sfr decreases most slowly among all three runs mainly because the accreted cold gas turns into stars later at the center of eh .",
    "eh - lh case + as lh approaches eh , a shock is formed between the two hot gas halos . the cold disk gas is compressed by the hot halo and produces more stars than the other two runs before the closest approach .",
    "the dissipation of the cold gas occurs much more effectively than the accretion of the halo gas onto the disk . when lh swings around eh near the closest approach , the inner trailing shock propagates toward the center of eh before the tidal bridge develops out of the gas disk , which has already been largely dissipated , toward eh and blocks its motion to the center of eh and ionizes it .",
    "therefore , only the old disk stars flow along the tidal bridge , and there is no burst of star formation within the cold gas that can be accreted to eh .",
    "the result of the interaction is mostly the old disk star accretion from lh to eh .",
    "the sfr of this run arises somewhat before the closest approach because of the shock between the two gas halos .",
    "the maximum value of the sfr after the closest approach is much greater than that in the other two runs , but it decreases rapidly because of the lack of the cold gas .    the almost no gas accretion from the ltg to the etg in run  eh - lh , unlike in run  eh - l , is hinted at in the snapshots taken shortly after the closest approach when the gas bridge develops .",
    "we show in figure  11 the gas bridges in runs  eh - l and eh - lh at @xmath111 = 5  gyr more closely . in the top panels ,",
    "the gas particles within the disks are displayed@xmath2@xmath120 plane , as explained in paper  i. ] on a new @xmath105@xmath2@xmath104 plane that has an @xmath105  axis along the line connecting the centers of the two galaxies and a zero point at the position where the net local gravitational acceleration is zero .",
    "the gas bridge in run  eh - l ( left panel ) develops toward the etg , well beyond the @xmath105 = 0 line at the time .",
    "however , in run  eh - lh ( right panel ) , the gas bridge does not grow well , reaching behind the @xmath105 = 0 line . in order to transfer some gas to the etg in run  eh - lh ,",
    "the gas bridge should have grown beyond the zero - gravity line before it is blocked by the shock .",
    "in addition , the pressure of the gas particles , shown in the bottom - right panel ( magenta solid line ) , rises near the end of the bridge .",
    "this implies that those particles feel the net force ( gravity plus pressure gradient force ) toward the ltg and will not be able to flow to the etg at later times .",
    "the above results would vary in different situations .",
    "for example , in a case where lh encountered with eh more closely ( keeping the other orbital parameters unchanged ) , the gas tidal bridge might be able to grow more strongly to the etg before being blocked by the shock .",
    "then , some gas will manage to flow to the etg despite the shock .",
    "the materials transferring through the gas and stellar bridges might include star - forming gas and young stars in run  eh - lh , as in run  eh - l .",
    "it is also possible for the non - star - forming cold gas to flow to the etg for a while through the gas bridge and turn into stars there when they become dense enough .",
    "the gas bridge is expected to vanish more quickly in run eh - lh after all , compared with the gas bridge in run eh - l , because the shock would still cross the gas bridge and ionize it . in the case of eh - l ,",
    "the sfr might start to increase before the closest approach , as in run  eh - lh , when they encountered each other more closely .",
    "finally , in run e - l we expect that the disk materials captured by the etg will hardly include star - forming gas and young stars , even in somewhat closer encounters because there is still no compression of the cold gas by shock .",
    "the materials transferring to e through the star and gas bridges would also more likely orbit around the center of e and rarely settle down at the center , unless all of the model and orbital parameters were matched to cancel out the transverse component of the velocities of the particles , leaving only the radial component .",
    "some cold gas transferred to e might be able to turn into stars later when it becomes dense enough in closer encounters .",
    "overall , our simulations show that the cold gas flow and the star formation activity depend strongly on whether or not the hot gas halo is included in the etg and/or the ltg , whereas the amount of the old disk stars accreted to the etg and their dynamics are almost the same in all runs .",
    "therefore , we claim that it is necessary to include hot halo gas properly in galaxy interaction simulations in order to more accurately study the transient phenomena .",

    "as time passes , some gas particles turn into stars , and spiral patterns and a central bar develop in the disk ( the bar is seen in a more close - up view that is not included in this paper ) . at later times , the gas on the disk becomes dissipated .",
    "this is primarily because the gas has been continuously consumed by star formation , and also some of the disk gas has been heated by hot halo gas and joined the halo ( see the blue points detached from the disk ) , while gas accretion from the halo occurs not very actively .",
    "the amount of the newly formed stars out of the original halo gas particles compared to that out of the original disk gas particles is less than 1  % . among the star - forming gas particles ( cyan points ) ,",
    "the percentage of the original halo gas particles that cooled down onto the disk is less than 1  % , as well .",
    "compared to model  l without a gas halo , the star formation and the gas dissipation in the disk in model  lh occur more actively over the course of the simulation because of the pressure on the gas disk exerted by the gas halo , despite of the gas heating .",

    "the sfr rises as high as in run  eh - lh ( see the bottom panel in figure  10 ) , but it increases abruptly right after the closest approach . as shown in the bottom panels of figure  13 , the halo gas of the ltg ( pink points ) is strongly disturbed by the gravitational pull of the more massive etg .",
