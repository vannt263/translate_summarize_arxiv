    "the three - dimensional structure of proteins is strictly connected to the biological functions these molecules perform in living cells @xcite . among various experimental techniques ,",
    "an increasingly important role in the study of protein structures is being played by single ",
    "molecule force spectroscopy , where proteins @xcite ( but also nucleic acid fragments @xcite ) are pulled by applying controlled forces to their ends through an atomic force microscope ( afm ) or optical tweezers .    by studying the dynamical response of proteins to constant or varying loading ,",
    "much information on their structure has been gathered @xcite . in particular , the possibility of controlling the applied force with high precision has allowed to trace the molecule folding and unfolding pathways @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as the size of the molecules increases , force spectroscopy outcomes can not be easily related to molecular properties .",
    "thus theoretical models of biomolecules subject to an external force have been developed @xcite , which represent important tools to study the interplay between protein response to external force and molecular structure .    in most cases ,",
    "these models are based on a coarse  grained description of the biomolecule , their dynamical degrees of freedom being related to the coordinates and velocities of a suitable set of reference beads , typically one or a few per amino  acid @xcite . equilibrium and nonequilibrium results are then obtained by means of ( time expensive ) computer simulations .    in a recent paper @xcite we have approached the problem of protein unzipping from a different point of view , introducing a simple lattice model with binary degrees of freedom , based on ( and generalizing ) the wako ",
    "sait ( ws ) model of protein folding @xcite .",
    "despite its simplicity , the model turned out to exhibit the typical response of real proteins to pulling .",
    "in particular , the mechanical unfolding of the 27th immunoglobulin domain of titin was investigated , considering both force clamp and dynamic loading protocols .",
    "theoretically expected laws were verified and an excellent agreement with the experimental values of the characteristic kinetic parameter was found .",
    "the model was also used to investigate the possibility of reconstructing the protein free energy landscape by exploiting an extended version of the jarzynski equality ( je ) @xcite .",
    "the present paper has several purposes . on the methodological side , we give a full derivation of the relation between our model and the original ws model , and show in detail how to obtain free energy landscapes . on the application side ,",
    "we consider three other molecules ( including bbl , whose thermal behaviour has recently been the subject of some debate , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein , and ref .",
    "@xcite ) in addition to titin and , together with the properties already investigated in @xcite , we discuss also the probability distribution of unfolding times and forces .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we describe the details of our model , its connection with the ws model , and the simulation method . in section [ eq_p ]",
    "we present the equilibrium properties of the model proteins , as functions of force and temperature .",
    "we then present the results of mechanical unfolding obtained by numerical simulations , first , in section [ fc ] , for the force clamp manipulation and then , in section [ dl ] , for the dynamic loading . in section [ eje ] , the free energy landscape of the model proteins is reconstructed from unfolding manipulations , by using an extended jarzynski equality .",
    "conclusions are drawn , and future developments are sketched , in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in the present section , we define our model and show that in the absence of an external force it reduces to the ws model of protein folding .",
    "the latter was introduced in 1978 by wako and sait , in two papers @xcite that appear to have been forgotten until recent years . the same model was independently reintroduced by muoz , eaton and coworkers at the end of the 90s @xcite .",
    "these authors used the model to describe and interpret experimental results , and soon the model became quite popular @xcite .",
    "this is why it is often referred to as the muoz ",
    "eaton , or wako  sait  muoz  eaton , model .",
    "the first recent reference to the original work by wako and sait appeared , as far as we know , in @xcite .",
    "similarly to the ws model , the state of a protein is defined according to the conformation of its peptide bond backbone , and in order to reduce the degrees of freedom , we assume that the peptide bonds can exist only in two conformations : native and non - native . thus a @xmath0 amino  acid protein is represented as a chain of @xmath1 peptide bonds , and a binary variable @xmath2 is associated to each peptide bond .",
    "bonds are numbered from 1 to @xmath1 and amino  acids from 1 to @xmath0 , bond @xmath3 connecting amino  acids @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the variable @xmath2 takes the value @xmath5 corresponding to a peptide bond in unfolded or native state respectively .    in order to couple the molecule to an external force we regard stretches of consecutive native bonds ( delimited by unfolded bonds ) as rigid portions of the protein with their own ( native ) end - to - end length : in the following @xmath6 will indicate the end - to - end length of the stretch of consecutive amino  acids connected by native bonds and delimited by unfolded bonds in positions @xmath7 and @xmath8 : @xmath9 , @xmath10 for @xmath11 ; if we define the quantity @xmath12 this condition can be expressed in a more compact form : @xmath13 . in the limiting case",
    "@xmath14 the stretch reduces to amino  acid @xmath15 , which is characterized by its native length @xmath16 . in the following , `` stretch",
    "'' will refer to stretches of any length , including single amino  acids .",
    "boundary conditions @xmath17 are introduced to define the stretches at the protein ends .",
    "it is easy to verify that the number of stretches is equal to 1 plus the number of 0 s in the set @xmath18 .",
    "we want to keep our model as simple as possible , therefore only two orientations of rigid stretches are considered : given the direction of the external force , a stretch can only be oriented parallel or antiparallel to the force direction .",
    "thus , following @xcite , we introduce the variables @xmath19 which describe the orientation of the stretch with respect to the external force @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the configuration of the molecule is fixed by the set of @xmath21 values , and for each configuration the protein end  to  end length is given by @xmath22 a cartoon of the model protein is plotted in fig.[mol1 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that a given bond configuration @xmath23 dynamically fixes the set of variables @xmath24 : for each configuration @xmath23 only those variables @xmath24 such that @xmath25 are considered .",

    "the microscopic degrees of freedom @xmath34 do not interact among themselves , hence the partial partition sum over them can be performed analytically .",

    "we choose @xmath65 .",
    "as far as the parameters @xmath6 are concerned , the generic amino  acid @xmath7 is represented by its @xmath66 sequence .",
    "taking the native state as the reference configuration , @xmath6 is chosen as the distance between the midpoint of the @xmath67 and @xmath68 atoms and the midpoint of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 atoms .    in the present paper",
    "we shall consider four different molecules of increasing size : 1bbl ( 37 amino  acids , see @xcite for details ) , 1i6c ( 39 amino  acids ) , 1coa ( 64 amino  acids ) , 1tit ( 89 amino  acids ) . here and in the following the proteins",
