    "the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath3 plays a crucial role in both nuclear physics and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "although significant progress has been made in recent years in determining the density dependence of @xmath3 @xcite , large uncertainties still exist even around the normal density @xmath4 @xcite , and this has hindered us from understanding more precisely many important properties of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "to constrain the symmetry energy with higher accuracy is thus of crucial importance .",
    "theoretically , it has been established bro00,hor01,fur02,yos04,che05b , tod05,rei10,dan03,cen09 that the neutron skin thickness @xmath5 of heavy nuclei , given by the difference of their neutron and proton root - mean - squared radii , provides a good probe of @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , @xmath6 has been found to correlate strongly with both @xmath7 and @xmath1 in microscopic mean - field calculations @xcite .",
    "it is , however , difficult to extract an accurate value for @xmath8 from comparing the calculated @xmath6 of heavy nuclei with experimental data as it depends on several nuclear interaction parameters in a highly correlated manner @xcite and the calculations have been usually carried out by varying the interaction parameters .",
    "a well - known example is the skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) approach using normally @xmath9 interaction parameters and there are more than @xmath10 sets of skyrme interaction parameters in the literature .    in the present talk ,",
    "we report our recent work @xcite on a new method to analyze the correlation between observables of finite nuclei and some macroscopic properties of asymmetric nuclear matter . instead of varying directly the @xmath9 interaction parameters within the shf , we express them explicitly in terms of @xmath9 macroscopic observables that are either experimentally well constrained or empirically well known .",
    "then , by varying individually these macroscopic observables within their known ranges , we can examine more transparently the correlation of @xmath6 with each individual observable .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated that important constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be obtained with the application of this correlation analysis to existing data on the neutron skin thickness of sn isotopes .",
    "in the standard shf model @xcite , the @xmath9 skyrme interaction parameters , i.e. , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 can be expressed analytically in terms of @xmath9 macroscopic quantities @xmath14 , @xmath15 , the incompressibility @xmath16 , the isoscalar effective mass @xmath17 , the isovector effective mass @xmath18 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , the gradient coefficient @xmath19 , and the symmetry - gradient coefficient @xmath20  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath21 + 8g_{s}/3,\\quad x_{1}=\\left [ 12g_{v}-4g_{s}-\\frac{6d}{{\\rho _ { 0}(}k_{\\mathrm{f}}^{0})^{2}}\\right ] /(3t_{1}),\\notag\\\\ t_{2 } & = & \\frac{4(25c-18d)}{9{\\rho _ { 0}(}k_{\\mathrm{f}}^{0})^{2}}-\\frac{8(g_{s}+2g_{v})}{3},\\notag\\\\ x_{2 } & = & \\left [ 20g_{v}+4g_{s}-\\frac{5(16c-18d)}{3{\\rho _ { 0}(}k_{\\mathrm{f}}^{0})^{2}}\\right ] /(3t_{2 } ) , \\notag\\\\ t{_{3 } } & = & 16\\beta /\\left [ { \\rho _ { 0}}^{\\gamma } ( \\gamma + 1)\\right],\\quad x{_{3 } } = -3y(\\gamma + 1)e_{\\text{\\textrm{sym}}}^{\\mathrm{loc}}({\\rho _ { 0}})/(2\\beta ) -1/2,\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are defined as @xcite @xmath30\\notag\\\\ & & \\times\\frac{k_{0}+2e_{\\mathrm{kin}}^{0}-10c}{k_{0}+9e_{0}(\\rho _ { 0})-e_{\\mathrm{kin}}^{0}-4c},\\notag \\\\ \\beta & = & \\left[\\frac{e_{\\mathrm{kin}}^{0}}{3}-e_{0}(\\rho _ { 0})-\\frac{2}{3}c\\right]\\frac{k_{0}-9e_{0}(\\rho _ { 0})+5e_{\\mathrm{kin}}^{0}-16c}{k_{0}+9e_{0}(\\rho _ { 0})-e_{\\mathrm{kin}}^{0}-4c } , \\notag \\\\ \\gamma & = & \\frac{k_{0}+2e_{\\mathrm{kin}}^{0}-10c}{3e_{\\mathrm{kin}}^{0}-9e_{0}(\\rho _ { 0})-6c},\\quad y = \\frac{l-3e_{\\text{\\textrm{sym}}}({\\rho _ { 0}})+e_{\\text{\\textrm{\\ sym}}}^{\\mathrm{kin}}({\\rho _ { 0}})-2d}{3(\\gamma -1)e_{\\text { \\textrm{sym}}}^{\\mathrm{loc}}({\\rho _ { 0}})},\\end{aligned}\\]]with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    as a reference for",
