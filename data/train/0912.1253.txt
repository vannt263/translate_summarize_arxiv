    "studies of magnetoresistance , in particular , the investigation of shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations in semiconductors and metals is an important tool for gathering information about band structure , quantum lifetimes of electrons and interaction mechanisms @xcite . in two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems ,",
    "the sdh oscillations occur because of a periodic modulation of electron scattering as the landau levels consecutively pass through the fermi level .",
    "with increasing temperature , when the thermal broadening of the fermi distribution exceeds the cyclotron energy @xmath0 , the sdh oscillations are strongly damped . in quantum wells with",
    "at least two occupied 2d subbands , the magnetoresistance exhibits another kind of oscillating behavior , the so - called magneto - intersubband ( mis ) oscillations @xcite .",
    "these oscillations occur because of a periodic modulation of the probability of transitions between the landau levels belonging to different subbands .",
    "the mis oscillation peaks correspond to the subband alignment condition @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the subband separation , because the isoenergetic ( elastic ) scattering of electrons between the landau levels is maximal under this condition .",
    "since the origin of the mis oscillations is not related to the position of landau levels with respect to the fermi energy , these oscillations survive at high temperatures when the sdh oscillations are completely damped .",
    "early experimental studies of mis oscillations have been carried out in single quantum wells with two populated 2d subbands @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , mis oscillations with large amplitudes have been observed and investigated in two - subband systems based on double quantum wells ( dqws ) @xcite .",
    "the dqws appear to be the most convenient systems for experimental studies of this penomenon , because the two - subband occupation is attainable at relatively small electron densities , the electron mobility is high , and a strong tunnel coupling between the wells enables a high probability of intersubband scattering . the studies of mis oscillations in dqws provide information about temperature dependence of the quantum lifetime of electrons in the region where sdh oscillations are absent @xcite .",
    "the mis oscillations are also interesting owing to their interplay with another magneto - oscillatory phenomenon recently discovered in high - mobility 2d layers .",
    "if a 2d electron system is exposed to a continuous microwave irradiation , microwave - induced resistance oscillations ( miros ) occur , which are governed by the ratio of the radiation frequency @xmath3 to the cyclotron frequency @xmath4 @xcite . with increasing radiation intensity",
    ", the minima of these oscillations evolve into `` zero - resistance states '' @xcite in samples with ultrahigh electron mobility .",
    "similar to mis oscillations , miros originate from a periodic modulation of the probability of electron transitions between different landau levels . in single - subband systems ,",
    "such transitions occur because of electron scattering in the presence of microwave excitation , when electrons absorb radiation quanta and gain the energy necessary for the transitions .",
    "a detailed theoretical description of miros involves consideration of several microscopic mechanisms of photoresistance , which satisfactory describe the observed periodicity and phase of these oscillations @xcite-@xcite . among them ,",
    "the inelastic mechanism @xcite , associated with a microwave - generated non - equilibrium oscillatory component of the isotropic part of the electron distribution function , dominates at low temperatures @xmath5 , because its contribution is proportional to the inelastic relaxation time @xmath6 .",
    "recently , miros have been studied in systems with two occupied subbands ( dqws ) @xcite .",
    "it is found that the interplay between mis oscillations and miros manifests itself as an interference of these kinds of oscillations , which is formally expressed as a product of the corresponding oscillating factors @xcite .",
    "the observed magnetoresistance pattern strongly depends on frequency @xmath3 and exhibits inversion or enhancement of certain groups of mis peaks .",
    "it is established that the inelastic mechanism of microwave photoresistance explains magnetoresistance oscillations in such two - subband systems @xcite .",
    "previous studies of mis oscillations and their interference with miros have been restricted to two - subband systems . in this paper",
    "we present experimental and theoretical studies of these phenomena in systems with three occupied subbands formed in triple quantum wells ( tqws ) .",
    "the symmetric triple - well structure under investigation is shown in fig .",
    "the barriers dividing the wells are thin enough to have a strong tunnel hybridization of electron states in different wells . as a result ,",
    "there exist three subbands with different quantization energies @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and all of them are occupied by electrons at the chosen ( high enough ) electron density .",
    "we have found that the magnetoresistance of such systems exhibits mis oscillations with several periods determined by subband separation energies @xmath9 .",
    "the peculiar mis oscillation picture is distinct from that observed in dqws , where only one mis period exists .",
    "this feature has not been mentioned in previous studies of tqws by other groups @xcite , which concentrated on the regime of high magnetic fields and quantum hall effect .",
    "next , we have demonstrated that the mis oscillation picture in tqws exposed to microwave irradiation changes and depends on the radiation frequency .",
    "this behavior is basically similar to that in the case of dqws described above .",
    "to explain the observed mis oscillations and their interference with miros in tqws , we generalize the magnetoresistance theory in the presence of microwave irradiation to the multisubband case .",
