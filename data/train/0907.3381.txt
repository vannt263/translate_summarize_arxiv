    "spin glasses are magnetic materials with strange properties that distinguish them from ordinary ferromagnets . in statistical physics , the study of spin glasses originated with the works of edwards and anderson  @xcite and sherrington and kirkpatrick @xcite in 1975 . in the following decade",
    ", the theoretical study of spin glasses led to the invention of deep and powerful new methods in physics , most notably parisi s broken replica method .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a survey of the physics literature .    however , these physical breakthroughs were far beyond the reach of rigorous proof at the time , and much of it remains so till date .",
    "the rigorous analysis of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model began with the works of aizenman , lebowitz and ruelle @xcite and frhlich and zegarliski @xcite in the late eighties ; the field remained stagnant for a while , interspersed with a few nice papers occasionally ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the deepest mysteries of the broken replica analysis of the s - k model remained mathematically intractable for many more years until the path - breaking contributions of guerra , toninelli , talagrand , panchenko and others in the last ten years ( see e.g.   @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "arguably the most notable achievement in this period was talagrand s proof of the parisi formula @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of all this remarkable progress , our understanding of these complicated mathematical objects is still shrouded in mystery , and many conjectures remain unresolved . in this article",
    "we attempt to give a mathematical foundation to some aspects of spin glasses that have been well - known in the physics community for a long time but never before penetrated by rigorous mathematics .",
    "let us now embark on a description of our main results .",
    "further references and connections with the literature will be given at the appropriate places along the way .",
    "consider the following simple - looking probabilistic question : suppose @xmath1 are i.i.d .",
    "standard gaussian random variables , and we define , for each @xmath2 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath3 then is it true that with high probability , there is a large subset @xmath4 of @xmath5 such that @xmath6 and any two distinct elements @xmath7 of @xmath4 are nearly orthogonal , in the sense that @xmath8 ( in the spin glass literature , the quantity @xmath9 is called the ` overlap ' between the ` configurations ' @xmath10 and @xmath11 . ) to realize the non - triviality of the question , consider a slightly different gaussian field @xmath12 on @xmath5 , defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 are i.i.d .",
    "standard gaussian random variables .",
    "then clearly , @xmath12 is maximized at @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "note that for any @xmath17 , @xmath18 it is not difficult to argue from here that if @xmath17 is another configuration that is near - maximal for @xmath12 , then @xmath17 must agree with @xmath15 at nearly all coordinates .",
    "thus , the field @xmath12 does not satisfy the ` multiple peaks picture ' that we are investigating about @xmath19 .",
    "this is true in spite of the fact that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are approximately independent for almost all pairs @xmath22 .",
    "we have the following result about the existence of multiple peaks in the field @xmath19 .",
    "it says that with high probability , there is a large collection @xmath4 of configurations satisfying and , that is , @xmath23 for any two distinct @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for each @xmath26 .",
    "[ multisk ] let @xmath19 be the field defined in , and define the overlap @xmath27 between configurations @xmath7 by the formula .",
    "let @xmath28 then there are constants @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 such that with probability at least @xmath33 , there is a set @xmath34 satisfying    1 .",
    "@xmath35 , 2 .",
    "@xmath36 for all @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and 3 .",
    "@xmath39 for all @xmath26 .",
    "quantitatively , we can take @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is an absolute constant",
    ". however these are not necessarily the best choices .",
    "let us now discuss the implication of this result in spin glass theory .",
    "the sherrington - kirkpatrick model of spin glasses , introduced in @xcite , is defined through the hamiltonian ( i.e.  energy function ) @xmath45 the s - k model at inverse temperature @xmath46 defines a probability measure @xmath47 on @xmath5 through the formula @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the normalizing constant .",
    "the measure @xmath47 is called the gibbs measure .    according to the folklore in the statistical physics community , the energy landscape of the s - k model has ` multiple valleys ' .",
    "although no precise formulation is available , one way to view this is that there are many nearly orthogonal states with nearly minimal energy . for a physical discussion of the ` many states ' aspect of the s - k model",
    ", we refer to @xcite , chapter iii .",
    "a  very interesting rigorous formulation was attempted by talagrand  ( see @xcite , conjecture 2.2.23 ) , but no theorems were proved . although our achievement is quite modest , and may not be satisfactory to the physicists because we do not prove that the approximate minimum energy states correspond to significantly large regions of the state space  in fact , one may say that it is not what is meant by the physical term ` multiple valleys ' at all because an isolated low energy state does not necessarily represent a valley  it does seem that theorem  [ multisk ] is the first rigorous result about the multimodal geometry of the sherrington - kirkpatrick energy landscape .",
    "we may call it ` multiple valleys in a weak sense ' .",
    "theorem [ multisk ] can be generalized to the following corollary , which shows that weak multiple valleys exist at ` every energy level ' and not only for the lowest energy .",
    "[ multisk2 ] let all notation be the same as in theorem [ multisk ] . fix a number @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "then for all sufficiently large @xmath51 , with probability at least @xmath52 there exists a set @xmath53 satisfying conditions and of theorem  [ multisk ] , such that @xmath54 for all @xmath55 .    the variables @xmath1 in the hamiltonian @xmath56 are collectively called the ` couplings ' or the ` disorder ' .",
    "our proof of theorem [ multisk ] is based on the chaotic nature of the s - k model under small perturbations of the couplings ; this is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the relation between chaos and multiple valleys follows from a general principle outlined in  @xcite , although the proof in the present paper is self - contained .",
    "recall the gibbs measure @xmath47 of the s - k model , defined in .",
    "suppose @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two configurations drawn independently according to the measure @xmath47 , and the overlap @xmath9 is defined as in .",
    "it is known that when @xmath57 , @xmath58 with high probability @xcite .",
    "however , it is also known that @xmath9 can not be concentrated near zero for all @xmath59 , because that would give a contradiction to the existence of a phase transition as established in @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is believed that the limiting distribution of @xmath9 in the low temperature phase is given by the so - called ` parisi measure ' , a notion first made rigorous by talagrand @xcite .",
    "now suppose we choose @xmath11 not from the gibbs measure @xmath47 , but from a new gibbs measure @xmath60 , based on a new hamiltonian @xmath61 which is obtained by applying a small perturbation to the hamiltonian @xmath56 .",
    "( we will make precise the notion of a small perturbation below . )",
    "is it still true that @xmath9 has a non - degenerate limiting distribution at low temperatures ?",
    "the conjecture of disorder chaos ( i.e.  chaos with respect to small fluctuations in the disorder @xmath1 ) states that indeed that is not the case : @xmath9 is concentrated near zero if @xmath10 is picked from the gibbs measure and @xmath11 is picked from a perturbed gibbs measure .",
    "this is supposed to be true at all temperatures .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , disorder chaos for the s - k model was first discussed in the widely cited paper of bray and moore @xcite ; a related discussion appears in the earlier paper  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of chaos itself was first conjectured by fisher and huse @xcite in the context of the edwards - anderson model , although the term was coined in @xcite . again , to the best of our knowledge , nothing has been proved rigorously yet .",
    "for further references in the physics literature , let us refer to the recent paper  @xcite .",
    "note that this idea of chaos should not be confused with temperature chaos ( also discussed in @xcite ) , which says that spin glasses are chaotic with respect to small changes in the inverse temperature @xmath59 .",
    "we shall consider two kinds of perturbation of the disorder .",
    "the first , what we call ` discrete perturbation ' , is executed by replacing a randomly chosen small fraction of the couplings @xmath62 by independent copies . here",
    "small fraction means a fraction @xmath0 that goes to zero as @xmath63 .",
    "discrete perturbation is the usual way to proceed in the noise - sensitivity literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , it seems that the following result is intimately connected with noise - sensitivity , although we do not see any obvious way to use the standard noise - sensitivity techniques to derive it .",
    "[ chaosdisc ] consider the s - k model at inverse temperature @xmath59 .",
    "take any @xmath51 and @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "suppose a randomly chosen fraction @xmath0 of the couplings @xmath62 are replaced by independent copies to give a perturbed gibbs measure .",
    "let @xmath10 be chosen from the original gibbs measure and @xmath11 is chosen from the perturbed measure .",
    "let the overlap @xmath9 be defined as in  .",
    "then @xmath65 where @xmath44 is an absolute constant and the expectation is taken over all randomness .",
    "this theorem shows that the system is chaotic if the fraction @xmath0 goes to zero slower than @xmath66 .",
    "the derivation of this result is based on the ` superconcentration ' property of the free energy in the s - k model that we present in the next subsection .",
    "the notion of perturbation in the above theorem , though natural , is not the only available notion .",
    "in fact , in the original physics papers ( e.g.  @xcite ) , a different manner of perturbation is proposed , which we call continuous perturbation . here",
    "we replace @xmath67 by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is another set of indepenent standard gaussian random variables and @xmath70 so that the resultant couplings are again standard gaussian .",
    "when @xmath71 , we say that the perturbation is small . a convenient way to parametrize the perturbation is to set @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a parameter that we call ` time ' .",
    "this nomenclature is natural , because perturbing the couplings up to time @xmath73 corresponds to running an ornstein - uhlenbeck flow at each coupling for time @xmath73 , with initial value @xmath67 .",
    "the following theorem says that the s - k model is chaotic under small continuous perturbations .",
    "[ chaoscont ] consider the s - k model at inverse temperature @xmath59 .",
    "take any @xmath74 .",
    "suppose we continuously perturb the couplings up to time  @xmath73 , as defined above .",
    "let @xmath10 be chosen from the original gibbs measure and @xmath11 be chosen from the perturbed measure .",
    "let the overlap @xmath9 be defined as in  .",
    "then there is an absolute constant @xmath44 such that for any positive integer @xmath75 , @xmath76 the expectation is taken over all randomness .",
    "again , the achievement is very modest , and does not come anywhere close to the claims of the physicists .",
    "but once again , this is the first rigorous result about chaos of any kind in the s - k model .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the only other instance of a rigorous proof of chaos in any spin glass model is in the work of panchenko and talagrand  @xcite , who established chaos with respect to small changes in the external field in the spherical s - k model .",
    "disorder chaos in directed polymers was established by the author in @xcite .",
    "a deficiency of both theorems in this subsection is that they do not cover the case of zero temperature , that is , @xmath77 , where gibbs measure concentrates all its mass on the ground state . in principle",
    ", the same techniques should apply , but there are some crucial hurdles that can not be cleared with the available ideas .",
    "the notion of superconcentration was defined in  @xcite .",
    "the definition in @xcite pertains only to maxima of gaussian fields , but it can be generalized to roughly mean the following : a lipschitz function of a collection of independent standard gaussian random variables is superconcentrated whenever its order of fluctuations is much smaller than its lipschitz constant .",
    "this definition is related to the classical concentration result for the gaussian measure , which says that the order of fluctuations of a lipschitz function under the gaussian measure is bounded by its lipschitz constant ( see e.g.  theorem 2.2.4 in @xcite ) , irrespective of the dimension .",
    "the free energy of the s - k model is defined as @xmath78 where @xmath56 is the hamiltonian defined in .",
    "it follows from classical concentration of measure that the variance of @xmath79 is bounded by a constant multiple of @xmath51 ( see corollary 2.2.5 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is the best known bound for @xmath80 . when @xmath57 , talagrand ( theorems 2.2.7 and 2.2.13 in @xcite ) proved that the variance can actually be bounded by an absolute constant",
    "this is also indicated in the earlier works of aizenman , lebowitz and ruelle @xcite and comets and neveu @xcite .",
    "therefore , according to our definition , the free energy is superconcentrated when @xmath57 .",
    "the following theorem shows that @xmath81 is superconcentrated at any @xmath59 .",
    "[ superconc ] let @xmath79 be the free energy of the s - k model defined above in .",
    "for any @xmath59 , we have @xmath82 where @xmath44 is an absolute constant .",
    "this result may be reminiscent of the @xmath83 improvement in the variance of first passage percolation time  @xcite . however , the proof is quite different in our case since hypercontractivity , the major tool in @xcite , does not seem to work for spin glasses in any obvious way . in that sense ,",
    "the two results are quite unrelated .",
    "our proof is based on our chaos theorem for continuous perturbation ( theorem [ chaoscont ] ) and ideas from @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "theorem [ superconc ] is used to derive the chaos theorem for discrete perturbation , again drawing upon ideas from @xcite .",
    "this equivalence between chaos and superconcentration is one of the main themes of @xcite , which in a way shows the significance of superconcentration , which may otherwise be viewed as just a curious phenomenon .",
    "incidentally , it was shown by talagrand ( @xcite , eq .  ( 10.13 ) ) that the lower tail fluctuations of @xmath79 are actually as small as order @xmath84 under an unproven hypothesis about the parisi measure .",
    "let @xmath85 be an undirected graph .",
    "the edwards - anderson spin glass @xcite on @xmath86 is defined through the hamiltonian @xmath87 where @xmath62 is again a collection of i.i.d .",
    "random variables , often taken to be gaussian .",
    "the s - k model corresponds to the case of the complete graph , up to normalization by @xmath88 .    for a survey of the ( few ) rigorous and non - rigorous results available for the edwards - anderson model",
    ", we refer to newman and stein @xcite .    unlike the s - k model , there are two kinds of overlap in the e - a model .",
    "the ` site overlap ' is the usual overlap defined in .",
    "the ` bond overlap ' between two states @xmath10 and @xmath11 , on the other hand , is defined as @xmath89 we show that the bond overlap in the e - a model is not chaotic with respect to small fluctuations of the couplings at any temperature .",
    "this does not say anything about the site overlap ; the site overlap in the e - a model can well be chaotic with respect to small fluctuations of the couplings , as predicted in  @xcite .",
    "[ nochaos ] suppose the e - a hamiltonian on a graph @xmath86 is continuously perturbed up to time @xmath90 , according to the definition of continuous perturbation in section  [ chaossec ] .",

    "then @xmath94 where @xmath44 is a positive absolute constant .",
    "moreover , the result holds for @xmath77 also , with the interpretation that the gibbs measure at @xmath95 is just the uniform distribution on the set of ground states .",
    "an interesting case of the above theorem is when @xmath96 .",
    "the result then says that if two configurations are drawn independently from the gibbs measure , they have a non - negligible bond overlap with non - vanishing probability .",
    "the fact that this holds at any finite temperature is in contrast with the mean - field case ( i.e.  the s - k model ) , where there is a high - temperature phase ( @xmath57 ) where the bond overlap becomes negligible . however , while theorem [ nochaos ] establishes that the bond overlap does not become zero for any amount of perturbation , it does exhibit a sort of ` quenched chaos ' , in the following sense .",
    "[ quenchedchaos ] fix @xmath97 and let @xmath91 be as in theorem [ nochaos ]",
    ". then @xmath98    that is , if we perturb the system by an amount @xmath99 , the bond overlap between two configurations drawn from the two gibbs measures is approximately equal to the quenched average of the overlap .",
    "in physical terms , the overlap ` self - averages ' .    the combination of the last two theorems brings to light a surprising phenomenon . on the one hand ,",
    "the perturbation retains a memory of the original gibbs measure , because the overlap is non - vanishing in theorem  [ nochaos ] . on the other hand",
    ", the perturbation causes a chaotic reorganization of the gibbs measure in such a way that the overlap concentrates on a single value in theorem [ quenchedchaos ] .",
    "the author can see no clear explanation of this confusing outcome .",
    "the proof of theorem [ nochaos ] is based on the following result , which says that the free energy is not superconcentrated in the e - a model on bounded degree graphs .",
    "this generalizes a well - known result of wehr and aizenman @xcite , who proved the analogous result on square lattices .",
    "the relative advantage of our approach is that it does not use the structure of the graph , whereas the wehr - aizenman proof depends heavily on properties of the lattice .",

    "let @xmath93 be the maximum degree of @xmath86 . then for any @xmath59 , including @xmath95 ( where the free energy is just the energy of the ground state )",
    ", we have @xmath101    the above result is based on a formula ( theorem [ varformula ] ) for the variance of an arbitrary smooth function of gaussian random variables .",
    "it will clear from our proofs that the chaos and superconcentration results hold for the @xmath0-spin versions of the s - k model for even @xmath0 .",
    "( see chapter 6 of @xcite for the definition of these models and various results . ) in fact , a generalization of theorem [ chaoscont ] is proven in theorem [ pspin ] later , which includes the @xmath0-spin models for even @xmath0 .",
    "it will also be clear that the lack of superconcentration is true in the random field ising model on general bounded degree graphs .",
    "( again , the lattice case is handled in @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the definition of the rfim . )",
    "the absence of superconcentration in the rfim implies that the _ site _ overlap is stable under perturbations , instead of the bond overlap as in the e - a model .",
    "a simple model where our techniques give sharp results is the random energy model ( rem ) .",
    "this is discussed in subsection [ rem ] .      in spite of the progress made in this paper over  @xcite ,",

    "improve the multiple valley theorem ( theorem [ multisk ] ) so that @xmath102 is a negative power of @xmath51 , preferably better than @xmath103 , which will prove ` strong multiple valleys ' in the sense of @xcite .",

    "3 .   prove the chaos theorems ( theorems  [ chaosdisc ] and [ chaoscont ] ) for the ground state ( @xmath95 ) of the s - k model .",
    "4 .   improve the superconcentration result ( theorem [ superconc ] ) so that the right hand side is @xmath106 for some @xmath107 .",
    "this is tied to the improvement of the chaos result .",
    "if the above is not possible , at least prove a version of the superconcentration result where the right hand side does not depend on  @xmath59 , or has a better dependence than @xmath108 .",
