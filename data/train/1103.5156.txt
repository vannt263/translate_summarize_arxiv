    "low - energy phenomena in the hadron physics are strongly determined by the nonperturbative ( np ) interactions . at the fundamental ( qcd ) level hadron characteristics",
    "are analyzed in the qcd sum rules with a np vacuum condensates .",
    "hadron structure and interactions can be also considered in the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "starting from the qcd , chiral low - energy expansion of green functions leads to effective lagrangian with phenomenological coupling constants @xcite .",
    "effective chiral hadron model having the nambu - jona - lasinio structure with the quark - meson interactions and incorporating vector mesons as a gauge fields , has been also applied to the hadron reactions studying @xcite .",
    "in fact , quark - meson models contain some input ( np ) parameters : effective couplings , which are defined by the ( diverged ) quark loops .",
    "their regularization fixes some np scale of the theory , @xmath6 .",
    "obviously , these models reproduce both nonperturbative and structure effects of the low - energy interactions @xcite .    as it will be demonstrated , dynamical symmetry of hadron interactions can be adequately considered in the gauge scheme for hadron and ( constituent ) quark fields from the very beginning .",
    "so , gauge principles , spontaneous symmetry breaking and the higgs mechanism work well not only at the fundamental quark level , but at the hadron one . in this way",
    ", baryon - meson interactions were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the suggested renormalizable quantum field model is the @xmath5 model inspired construction , where the fundamental hadron components are reproduced by the constituent quarks and mesons . to analyze strong and electromagnetic processes",
    "it is sufficient to consider @xmath7 gauge group with the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "then , we localize the diagonal sum of chiral @xmath8 subgroups of the global @xmath9 group only . due to extra @xmath10 groups , vector meson dominance",
    "is realized at the gauge level as the mixing of initial gauge fields , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( their chiral partners occur after localization of the total chiral group ) . despite of radiative decays of light mesons",
    ", the model describes some details of the scalar meson physics .",
    "namely , after the spontaneous breaking of the local symmetry , residual scalar massive degrees of freedom ( higgs fields ) reproduce physical scalar states : isotriplet @xmath2 and isosinglet @xmath3 .",
    "some properties of the scalar meson spectra are explained in this way .",
    "note , @xmath5 meson is associated with @xmath14 meson @xcite .",
    "mesons @xmath15 and @xmath16 manifest themselves as real external fields , and work also as an effective virtual components of internal hadron vacuum .",
    "their occurence in loops can be understood as an excitation of the quark sea in a hadron .",
    "the initial model lagrangian can be written as follows : @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the first generation quark doublet ( the fundamental representation ) ; @xmath16-triplet is the adjoined representation of the @xmath19 gauge group ; @xmath15-meson is a singlet ; @xmath20 - two doublets of complex scalar fields with the hypercharges @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "physical states are formed by the primary fields mixing when quadratic mass forms of scalar and vector fields are diagonalized . at the tree level , the mass forms arise as a result of vacuum shifts which generate the gauge fields masses : @xmath24 .    the model lagrangian in terms of physical fields can be found in @xcite . due to universality of vector boson couplings , their interactions with quarks and mesons",
    "are described by three gauge parameters : @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the lagrangian vertices contains some orthogonal linear combinations of @xmath28 with ( tree ) mixing angles @xmath29 .",
    "these angles are fixed by the experimental data on the vector meson masses and decay widths .",
    "angle @xmath30 is determined by the diagonalization of the vector fields quadratic form .",
    "we have the following relations : @xmath31    in the model , effective `` tree '' couplings on the mass shell of external particles are reproduced by the sum of tree and one - loop quark and meson diagrams , they contain some np scale and depend on the mixing angles , @xmath32 and @xmath30 .",
    "so , the couplings incorporate both short - distance and long - distance contributions ; the `` tree '' couplings values are fixed from the data on meson two - particle decays with a sufficient accuracy .",
    "we suppose , these effective on - shell vertices ( not formfactors ! ) have tensor structure of the bare vertices . from preliminary considerations",
    "it follows that extra terms in off - shell formfactors ( @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the external momenta , for example ) contribute into physical quantities ( decay widths ) no more than @xmath35 .",
    "thus , firstly , there are loop diagrams , which contribute into on- and off - shell couplings .",
    "approximately , an account of these corrections can be reproduced by some multiplicative parameter in tree amplitudes . secondly , there are loop diagrams , which can not be reduced to contributions into the effective couplings and vertex formfactors .",
    "the obvious difference between effective on - shell constant couplings and off - shell formfactors ( depending on the np cutoff parameter ) prevents from the double - counting in the model .",
    "note , in these formfactors the internal particles masses interpret as the physical ones .",
    "therewith , decays like @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are described by finite quark loop diagrams . with a good accuracy",
    ", the vertex couplings in these diagrams can be taken as the effective @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) tree constants in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "note , these arguments can be applied to the electromagnetic vertices too - the vertices are renormalized by strong interactions , but the corrections from quark and meson loops are small in the case under consideration .",
    "this fact is endorsed by calculations of loop processes with on - shell photons , in particular , @xmath40 ( see below ) .",
    "thus , the consistency and supportability of the approach is verified by the results for all types of possible reactions - both at the tree and the loop level .",
    "to fix the set of the gauge physical couplings and vacuum shifts , we use experimentally observable mass spectrum and widths of some two - particle hadronic decays of vector mesons @xcite - in our model these processes occur at the tree level , fixing on - shell `` tree '' couplings .",
    "constants @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( or @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 are fixed from the experimental values of @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "then , the value of @xmath25 can be extracted from the relation @xmath50 ( see ( [ e:12c ] ) .",
    "thus , from the experimental data and ( [ e:12c ] ) we get the set of main parameters values : @xmath51",
    "due to two - level structure of the model , the meson - meson lagrangian classifies both tree and loop level processes , while the quark - meson interactions occur as loop contributions only .",
    "radiative decays of vector mesons @xmath52 and @xmath53 are some test reactions for the meson - meson sector of the gauge model .",
    "obvious tree diagrams ( see @xcite ) describe these processes with the pair @xmath54 production",
    ".    analytical form of the differential width for the process is presented in @xcite . in fig.1 curve ( 1 )",
    "describes the model fit of normalized spectrum of photons , @xmath55 , with a single free multiplicative parameter .",
    "it improves the description at the photon low energy range due to an account of @xmath56 dependence of couplings .",
    "namely , normalizing the spectrum by the theoretical value @xmath57 , the ratio depends on the @xmath58 formfactors at the different energy scales because intermediate pions are off - shell .",
    "totally , this multiplicative parameter increases the ratio no more than @xmath59 , due to the formfactors contribution .",
    "curve ( 2 ) demonstrates comparison of the spectrum with the experimental data  @xcite . to describe the spectrum fine structure near @xmath60 ,",
    "it was suggested to consider the loop corrections ( see @xcite ) which do not contribute in vertices formfactors .",
    "integrating of the spectrum from @xmath61 up to @xmath62 , we get the value of @xmath11- meson branching @xmath63 which slightly exceeds the experimental value @xmath64 @xcite",
    ". however , an account of loop contributions ( with the phenomenological couplings ) leads to even more result : @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "an excess of @xmath66 over @xmath67 can be caused by the lack of experimental data at energy range @xmath68 .",
    "replacing @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) and @xmath71 in the formula for the differential width , we have @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively ( it agrees with @xmath76  @xcite ) .    certainly , loop corrections are important and in analogy with  @xcite they can increase @xmath77 up to @xmath78 .",
    "essentially , in the loop level processes all divergencies are summed to zero when all external lines are on the mass shell @xcite .    in the quark - meson models",
    ", radiative decays @xmath79 and three - particle decays @xmath80 occur via quark loops only with the gauge ( tree ) vertices .",
    "corresponding one - loop diagrams and analytical expressions for the decays @xmath81 are in @xcite . the goldberger - treiman relation @xmath82 defining the constant of @xmath83 and @xmath84 interaction had been used . from this relation",
    "it also follows that vacuum shift @xmath85 .",
    "constituent quark mass value , as a free parameter , is extracted from the widths fit .",
    "the widths of @xmath79 agree with the experimental data @xcite if we take @xmath86 and keep an imaginary part of the amplitude as nonzero : @xmath87 note , isotopic structure of vertices gives : @xmath88 , and it is confirmed by the results of calculations .",
    "taking the small value @xmath89 , we assume that the ( constituent ) quarks propagate and annihilate in the internal np hadron vacuum , so they are not free asymptotic states .",
    "i.e. , the imaginary parts of amplitudes describe the constituent quark propagation up to the distances , where the np effects are sufficiently large to bind the quarks into a real meson .",
    "attractive forces between the quarks lead to the effective decreasing of their mass . instead , known `` naive '' idea can be used : imaginary part of quark loop equals zero `` by hand '' @xcite .",
    "then , from the above widths we get @xmath90 . a further way to provide the `` infrared confinement '' was suggested in @xcite by the introducing of a special cutoff parameter , @xmath91 , as a common scale in @xmath92 representation of the process amplitude . in particular , from this procedure the decay widths follow in a good agreement with the data , if @xmath90 and @xmath93 .",
    "at the same time , the value @xmath94 leads to light quarks , @xmath95 and nearly the same widths values . in all cases , the ratio @xmath96 .",
    "as it is known , decay @xmath40 is described by finite triangle quark diagrams .",
    "the decay width is : @xmath97 numerically , @xmath98 for @xmath99 . if @xmath100 , the width is @xmath101 . in the exact chiral limit @xcite @xmath102 , and the experimental value is in the interval @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "however , it should be taken into account : a ) a possible violation of the goldberger - treiman relation can be as much as @xmath104 @xcite ( it means a weak @xmath56 dependence of @xmath105 ) ; b ) @xmath106 mixing can be noticeable for the case @xcite , c ) loop corrections to @xmath107 vertex are also significant .",
    "namely , taking @xmath108 and decreasing effective @xmath84 coupling by @xmath109 only , we get @xmath110 . to explain the discrepance with the data , it is sufficient also to decrease the effective electromagnetic coupling @xmath107 no more than @xmath111 ( it can be provided by small variation of np scale , @xmath112 , in the diverged triangles of @xmath113 and @xmath114 types )",
    ". moreover , for the decay amplitude imaginary part equals zero . nevertheless , introducing an infrared cutoff with @xmath115 , for @xmath108 we have @xmath116 .",
    "however , nonuniversality of the parameter @xmath91 arises in the case . if @xmath117 , from exact integration of the amplitude we get a good agreement with the data .    from quark",
    "loops an effective couplings can be determined .",
    "then , @xmath118 and the model gives @xmath119 if @xmath120 ; @xmath121 for @xmath122 and @xmath123 when @xmath124 .",
    "analogously , @xmath125 and @xmath126 when @xmath127 ; @xmath128 and @xmath129 . for all these parameters we get the ratio @xmath130 , excepting light quark case with @xmath131 .",
    "scalar isotriplet @xmath2 occurs in the model with an accuracy up to small mixing angles , @xmath32 and @xmath30 .",
    "namely , from initial higgs doublets with @xmath132 after the spontaneous breaking , two charged scalar combinations arise .",
    "they can be unified with the residual neutral components to constitute the isotriplet . in the simple case of",
    "zero mixing ( then exact isotriplet structure emerges and @xmath133 , but this equality should be slightly broken by electromagnetic forces ) , @xmath134 and @xmath135 parts of the lagrangian have the form , where isovectors @xmath136 and @xmath137 are introduced : @xmath138= \\frac{i}{2}\\ , g_2\\,\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}\\rho^{\\mu}_{\\alpha}a_{\\beta}\\partial_{\\mu}a_{\\gamma}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    interaction of scalars with @xmath16-mesons is described by the lagrangian @xmath139    there is an interesting feature of this sector : mixing angle @xmath140 defining the physical fields @xmath141 can be equaled zero .",
    "then , from explicit expressions @xmath142 , @xmath143 we found : @xmath144 , if @xmath145 .",
    "it means @xmath146 , so the term @xmath147 in the initial lagrangian is damped . from experimentally known ( small ) difference of @xmath148 and @xmath149 masses an estimation of @xmath150 can be extracted , because @xmath151 .",
    "also , from @xmath152 it follows @xmath153 ; as a consequence , scalars @xmath154 do not interact with quark current directly .    due to free parameters , it is possible to consider dominant decay channels of scalar mesons - @xmath155 and @xmath156  @xcite .",
    "decay @xmath157 is not observed , so from @xmath158 it follows that @xmath159 .",
    "exact symmetry , @xmath133 , is not possible because it forbids the suppressed ( but observed ) decay @xmath160 .    at the tree level",
    "two - photon decays of scalar mesons are absent .",
    "considering @xmath39 decay , we have triangle loop diagrams mediated by quarks , pions , @xmath148- and @xmath11-mesons . due to above arguments ,",
    "vector meson loops are absent .",
    "total amplitude of the process is gauge invariant without any divergencies : @xmath161.$ ] experimentally , @xmath162 @xcite . from the `` naive approximation '' we get @xmath163 for @xmath164 and @xmath165 beyond the chiral limit . besides , @xmath166 for @xmath167 ; in this case an agreement can be achieved only if @xmath168 of the chiral limit value and @xmath169 .",
    "this value contradicts to known data @xmath170 .",
    "note , imaginary part of @xmath171 is small for all cases , and @xmath172 .",
    "now , the `` infrared confinement '' procedure results to @xmath173 for @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "all these values provide good agreement with the data for @xmath176 and @xmath155 decays .",
    "as to @xmath177 and @xmath178 , it has been found in @xcite that the decays can be explained only by four-(constituent ) quark components of the mesons . in the gauge model , these components are simulated by vector meson ( due to @xmath179 vertices ) and scalar meson loops ( due to @xmath180 verices ) ; analysis of these decays is in progress .    to include axial vector mesons and strange quarks , the model should be generalized to chiral @xmath181 . then dominant decay channel of the scalar mesons ( @xmath182 decay , for example ) will be understood and calculable as a possible admixture of @xmath183 states into scalar structure . note , however , the decay @xmath184 can be described by the symmetry allowed extra term @xmath185 in the model lagrangian .",
    "the gauge quantum field approach is applied to low - energy hadron interactions using the higgs mechanism in a framework of @xmath5 model with the vmd .",
    "residual higgs degrees of freedom allow to reproduce @xmath2 and @xmath3 scalars . due to free parameters , the mass degeneration of these mesons is explained .",
    "decay @xmath186 is damped , as it is known from the expriment , two - pion decays of @xmath187 ans @xmath5 mesons agree with the experimental data well .",
    "we also conclude that the two - quark components of scalar mesons ( @xmath188 ) are small - they occur at the loop level only .",
    "radiative decays of vector mesons ( at the tree and loop level ) and two - gamma decays of @xmath5 and @xmath4 mesons are well described too , the values @xmath189 and @xmath190 are preferred by the analysis with the `` infrared confinement '' procedure . also , the values of effective vertices @xmath191 correspond to known experimental data .",
    "so , the gauge renormalizable generalization of @xmath5 model based on @xmath192 group with the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the vmd is a reasonable and consequtive way to consider radiative and hadronic decays of vector and scalar mesons . some important features of scalar mesons spectrum are explained in the model due to interpretation of these mesons as vacuum fields .",
    "chiral generalization of the model should be done to include axial vector states and other scalar mesons into the gauge scheme .",
