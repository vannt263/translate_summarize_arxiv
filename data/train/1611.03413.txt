    "the large - scale modeling of fluid flow dynamics remains nowadays a major research issue in fluid mechanics or in geophysics despite an enormous research effort since the first investigations on the subject 150 years ago @xcite .",
    "the research themes behind this topic cover fundamental issues such as turbulence modeling and the analysis of fully developed turbulent flows , but also more applicative research problems related to the definition of practical numerical methods for the simulation of complex flows . in this latter case",
    "the difficulty consists in setting up a reliable modeling of the large - scale dynamics in which the contribution of unresolved small - scale processes are explicitly taken into account . for the navier - stokes equations ,",
    "the problem is all the more difficult that the spatial and temporal scales are tightly interacting together .",
    "the neglected processes include , among others things , the action of the unresolved motion scales , complex partially - known forcing , an incomplete knowledge of the boundary conditions and eventual numerical artifacts .",
    "such unresolved processes must be properly taken into account to describe accurately the energy transfers and to construct stable numerical simulations .",
    "in real world situations , the complexity of the involved phenomenon prevents the use of an accurate  but inescapably expensive  deterministic modeling .",
    "we advocate instead the use of a stochastic modeling .    within this prospect , we aim at describing the missing contributions through random fields encoding a flow component only in a probability distribution sense .",
    "those variables correspond to the discrepancies or errors between the dynamical model and the actual dynamics .",
    "their modeling is of the utmost importance in geophysics , either for data assimilation or forecasting issues . in both cases , an accurate modeling of the flow errors",
    "dynamics enables to maintain an ensemble of flow configurations with a sufficient but also meaningful diversity .",
    "small - scale processes are responsible both for an energy dissipation but also for local backscattering of energy @xcite .",
    "the introduction of random variables in the flow dynamics has been considered by several authors , as it constitutes an appealing mechanism for the phenomenological modeling of intermittent processes associated to the inverse energy cascade @xcite .",
    "recently those models have regained a great interest for the modeling of geophysical flows @xcite in climate sciences ( see also the thematic issue @xcite or the review @xcite ) .",
    "numerous turbulence models proposed in the context of large eddies simulations ( les ) and reynolds average simulations ( rans ) introduce _ de facto _ an eddy viscosity assumption to model the energy dissipation due to unresolved scales @xcite .",
    "this concept dates back to the work of boussinesq @xcite and prandtl @xcite .",
    "it relies on the hypothesis that the energy transfer from the resolved scales to the subgrid scales can be described in a similar way to the molecular viscosity mechanism .",
    "it is therefore not at all related to any uncertainty or error quantities . in models dealing explicitly with a statistical modeling of the turbulent fluctuations there",
    "is thus some incoherency in representing directly the dissipative mechanism attached to random terms through an eddy viscosity assumption . in this work",
    "we will not make use of such an hypothesis .",
    "instead , we will rely on a general diffusion expression that emerges naturally from our formalism .",
    "this subgrid model is properly derived from a general lagrangian stochastic model of the fluid motion in which the fluid parcels displacement is decomposed in two components : a smooth differentiable ( possibly random ) function and a random field , uncorrelated in time but correlated in space .",
    "such a decomposition consists in separating or `` filtering '' a rough velocity in a smooth slow time - scale component and a fast oscillating velocity field representing the unresolved flow .",
    "though there is , in general , no sharp time - scale separation in turbulent flows , the resolved velocity can be interpreted as a temporally coarse - grained component whereas the time - uncorrelated component stands for the small time - scale unresolved velocity .",
    "as a temporal smoothing imposes implicitly a spacial smoothing , this separation can be thus interpreted in terms of a les filtering technique . yet , the corresponding eulerian formulation does not ensue from a filtering procedure .",
    "it is thus not prone to errors associated to the violation of the commutation assumption between the filter and the spatial derivatives @xcite .",
    "besides , those equations introduce an effective advection related to the small - scale velocity inhomogeneity .",
    "this modified advection , empirically introduced in langevin models of particle dispersion @xcite , corresponds exactly to a phenomenon , termed _",
    "turbophoresis _ , related to the migration of inertial particles in regions of lower turbulent diffusivity @xcite .",
    "the large - scale representation of the navier - stokes equations on which we rely in this study are built from a stochastic version of the reynolds transport theorem @xcite .",
    "this modified reynolds transport theorem , which constitutes here the cornerstone of our large - scale dynamics representation , is presented in the following section .",
    "general invariance properties of the corresponding large - scale dynamics such as scale and galilean invariances are detailed in a comprehensive apppendix . in section [ experiments ]",
    "several novel subgrid tensors will be devised and compared on a standard green - taylor vortex flow @xcite .",
    "we will show that all the proposed schemes outperform the usual dynamic smagorinsky subgrid formulation @xcite .",
    "numerous methodological choices can be envisaged to devise stochastic representations of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the simplest method considers additional random forcing to the dynamics . this is the choice that has been the most often performed since the work of benssoussan @xcite .",
    "another choice , in the wake of kraichnan s work @xcite , consists in closing the large - scale flow representation in the fourier space by relying on a langevin equation @xcite .",
    "obviously the frontiers between those two methodologies are sometimes fuzzy , and numerous works rely on both strategies in order to devise the shape that should take the random variables evolution law @xcite .",
    "lagrangian stochastic models based on langevin equations have been also intensively used for turbulent dispersion @xcite or in probability density function ( pdf ) modeling of turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "those lagrangian models , which require to model the drift and diffusion functions , lead to very attractive particle based representations of complex flows @xcite .",
    "they are nevertheless not adapted to global large - scale eulerian representations of the flow dynamics .    in this work",
    ", we will rely on a different framework in specifying the stochastic nature of the velocity from the very beginning as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is built on the assumption that the lagrangian fluid particles displacement results from a smooth velocity component and a highly oscillating stochastic velocity component uncorrelated in time , @xmath0 with the velocity components : @xmath1 in this decomposition the first right - hand term is a smooth function of time associated to the large - scale velocity component .",
    "the second term stands for the small - scale velocity field .",
    "it is a white noise velocity component defined from the ( formal ) time - derivative of the random field : @xmath2 .",
    "this random field is a three - dimensional centered wiener process ; it is thus uncorrelated in time but can be anisotropic and inhomogeneous in space .",
    "since we focus in this study only on incompressible flows , the small - scale component is defined as a divergence - free random field ; it is hence associated to a divergence - free diffusion tensor : @xmath3 analogously to the standard deterministic case , the derivation procedure from the physical conservation laws of the navier - stokes equations is based primarily on the reynolds transport theorem ( rtt ) .",
    "the rtt provides the expression of the rate of change of a scalar function , @xmath4 , within a material volume , @xmath5 . for a stochastic flow ( [ sto - velocity ] ) with an incompressible small - scale velocity component ( @xmath6 ) , this expression derived in @xcite ( see also appendix [ appendix : srt ] where a comprehensive derivation is provided for readers convenience ) , is given by : @xmath7 { { \\mathrm{d}}}t   + { \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}q { \\boldsymbol{\\cdot}}{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}{{\\mathrm{d}}}{\\boldsymbol{b}}_t\\biggr){{\\mathrm{d}}}\\x .",
    "\\label{sto - r}~\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] this modified rtt involves the time increment of the random scalar quantity @xmath4 ( the differential of @xmath4 at a fixed point ) instead of the time derivative .",
    "a diffusion operator emerges also naturally . for clarity s sake",
    ", this term is designated as `` subgrid stress tensor '' following the protocols of large eddies simulation ( les ) . however , its construction is quite different .",
    "it is not based on boussinesq s eddy viscosity assumption nor on any structural turbulence models @xcite but arises directly from stochastic calculus rules .",
    "it expresses the mixing process exerted on the scalar quantity by the fast oscillating velocity component .",
    "this diffusion term is directly related to the small - scale component through the _ variance tensor _ , @xmath8 , defined from the diagonal of the small - scale velocity covariance : @xmath9 it can be checked that the variance tensor corresponds to an eddy viscosity term ( with units in @xmath10 .",
    "this term plays thus a role similar to the eddy viscosity models introduced in classical large scale representations @xcite or to the spectral vanishing viscosity @xcite .",
    "it is also akin to numerical regularization models considered in implicit models @xcite .",
    "our approach is nevertheless more general as it does not rely on _ a priori _ fixed shape of the reynold stress ( e.g.  boussinesq assumption ) nor does it presuppose a given numerical discrete scheme ( e.g.  implicit models ) .",
    "a corrective advection term , @xmath11 , appears also in the stochastic rtt formulation .",
    "this correction expresses the influence of the small scales inhomogeneity on the large ones .",
    "a drift is engendered from the regions associated with maximal variance ( maximal turbulent kinetic energy - tke ) toward the area of minimum variance ( e.g. minimal tke ) .",
    "this corresponds to the _ turbophoresis _ phenomenon associated with turbulence inhomogeneity , which drives inertial particles toward the regions of lower diffusivity @xcite . for homogeneous noise ,",
    "the variance tensor is constant and this corrective advection does not come into play .",
    "it can be noted that this advection correction is of the same form as the one proposed in @xcite .    through this modified rtt ,",
    "stochastic versions of the mass and momentum conservation equations can be ( almost ) directly derived .",
    "incompressibility conditions can for instance be immediately deduced from the rtt applied to @xmath12 and the flow jacobian ( @xmath13 ) : @xmath14 together with the incompressibility of the random term , the incompressibility condition reads thus : @xmath15 in the case of an incompressible large - scale flow component , @xmath16 , this reduces to : @xmath17 note that for a divergence - free isotropic random field such as the kraichnan model @xcite the last condition is naturally satisfied , since this unresolved velocity component is associated with a constant variance tensor .      applying the rtt to the fluid density , @xmath18 , and canceling this expression for arbitrary volumes , we get the following mass conservation constraint : @xmath19    for an incompressible fluid with constant density , together with a volume - preserving ( isochoric ) condition on the large - scale velocity component",
    ", we retrieve the incompressibility conditions ( [ incompressibility ] ) .",
    "it can be noted also that equation ( [ mass - conservation-1 ] ) still constitutes a transport equation since it preserves energy . as a matter of fact , it can be shown that the energy intake brought by the small - scale component is exactly compensated by the energy dissipation associated to the diffusion term @xcite .",
    "the application of the stochastic version of the rtt on the stochastic momentum and the introduction of the forces acting on the flow enables to derive from the second newton law the following navier - stokes equations @xcite :    [ sto - ns ] @xmath20    in this expression @xmath21 is the dynamic viscosity , @xmath22 denotes the large - scale ( slow ) pressure contribution and @xmath23 is a zero - mean turbulent pressure related to the small - scale velocity component .",
    "similarly to the classical reynolds decomposition , the dynamics of the resolved component includes an additional stress term that depends here on the resolved velocity component .",
    "a correction of the advection velocity also occurs .",
    "both terms depend on the variance tensor which gathers the action of the turbulent fluctuations on the large - scale velocity .",
    "it can be observed that the large - scale energy evolution is dissipative .",
    "this generalizes thus the boussinesq 1877 assumption , which conjectures a dissipative effect of the turbulent fluctuations on the mean flow . in the case of a divergence - free isotropic random field ( with a constant diagonal variance tensor ) , this system boils down to an intuitive constant eddy viscosity diffusivity model : @xmath24 where the laplacian dissipation term is augmented by the random field variance .",
    "the use of constant eddy viscosity thus finds here its justification as a direct consequence of an isotropic turbulence assumption .",
    "the subgrid stress tensor involved in our formalism constitutes an anisotropic diffusion whose preferential directions of diffusion are given by the small - scale velocity variance tensor . setting the diffusion tensor , @xmath25 , or its associated variance tensor allows us to define directly the subgrid diffusion term and the effective advection .",
    "for instance imposing to the small - scale random velocity to live on the iso - density surfaces provides immediately a clear justification of the isopycnal diffusion employed in oceanic circulation models @xcite .",
    "the specification of the turbulent fluctuations in terms of a stochastic process provides a means to interpret different subgrid models but also to devise new ones either through _ a priori _ specifications or data - driven strategies .",
    "general invariance properties of the proposed large - scale representation are listed in the appendix [ prop - nsu ] .",
    "we briefly summarize them here .",
    "it is in particular shown that the distribution of the velocity anomaly is in the general case not gaussian and does not consequently correspond to normal or quasi - normal approximations @xcite .",
    "we show that this stochastic representation has remarkable invariance properties ; it is galilean invariant and preserves ( in the absence of molecular viscosity ) the euler equations scale invariance properties .",
    "otherwise , a useful scaling for the variance tensor is derived from the kolmogorov - richardson scaling and a dimensionless number relating the large - scale kinetic energy to a characteristic value of the velocity variance at the resolved scale .",
    "interested readers may also consult @xcite for the derivation of stochastic representation of several geophysical flows .",
    "in this section we assessed , through numerical simulations , the performances of the proposed large - scale dynamics for different variance tensor models . those simple models have been defined from local statistics of the resolved component and compared to the classical smagorinsky subgrid model associated with a dynamical procedure @xcite .",
    "those numerical experiments have been performed on the taylor - green flow @xcite .",
    "taylor - green vortex flow is a critical test for numerical schemes , as both the convective term and viscous term play important roles . due to the energy cascade generated by the convective term",
    ", the flow becomes rapidly turbulent with the creation of small - scale structures up to a dissipation peak .",
    "this stage is followed by a decay phase similar to a decaying homogeneous turbulence . as a consequence , a precise and high - order representation of the viscous and convective terms",
    "is needed to get an accurate numerical simulation .",
    "this flow is considered as a prototypical system to study the production of small - scale eddies due to vorticity increase and vortex stretching mechanism @xcite .    in cartesian",
    "coordinates , this flow is defined by the following initial conditions : @xmath26 and @xmath27 the computation domain is defined as a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions on all the faces .",
    "the length of the domain is set to @xmath28 in each of the axis direction , which gives a characteristic length @xmath29 and a reynolds number @xmath30 . in the literature ,",
    "several high - order numerical methods have been tested for the direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of the taylor - green vortex flow , see @xcite and references therein . in this study",
    "we used a discrete scheme built on a divergence - free wavelet basis @xcite .",
    "this scheme presents several computational advantages .",
    "first of all , it guarantees a divergence - free solution in the physical domain with a good numerical complexity .",
    "besides , as the spatial filters considered corresponds to a multi - resolution projection , two successive filtering operations can be switched together .",
    "this property reveals useful within the germano dynamic strategy enabling to estimate the subgrid tensor weight factor .",
    "this numerical scheme achieves similar performances to a pseudo - spectral method .",
    "the different numerical simulations performed are mainly assessed and compared according to the evolution along time of the following criterion :    * the mean kinetic energy ( ke ) @xmath31 * the mean kinetic energy dissipation rate @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the rate of strain tensor : @xmath34 .",
    "the mean kinetic energy is linked to the dissipation rate by : @xmath35 to clearly separate those two forms of the energy dissipation we will denote @xmath36 the expression computed from the kinetic energy differentiation and @xmath37 the dissipation computed from the rate of strain norm .    besides , in the sequel , all those averaged quantities are computed in their dimensionless form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the convective time . the temporal evolution of those mean energy quantities enable to monitor the quality of the solution over time and to assess the accuracy of the discrete scheme used for the velocity gradients .",
    "in addition to those criterion , we will plot the energy spectrum of the resolved velocity at several distinct times .",
    "we evaluated first the ability of the divergence - free wavelet based method to reproduce faithfully the main features of the taylor - green flow .",
    "for this purpose , two different direct numerical simulations have been conducted .",
    "the first experiment concerns a simulation at a low reynolds number : @xmath40 . for this case",
    "the divergence - free wavelet has been run on a regular grid of @xmath41 points . for comparison purpose",
    "we performed a classical pseudo - spectral simulation with @xmath41 fourier modes .",
    "let us note that at this low reynolds number ( @xmath40 ) , only @xmath42 fourier modes are required to represent accurately all the hydrodynamics scales in the limit of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the kolmogorov scale @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the mean kinetic energy and the mean dissipation rate obtained for both methods are plotted on the left and right panels of figure [ energyfig ] respectively . as can be observed on those two graphics the solutions",
    "superimpose almost perfectly . for",
    "both methods the energy dissipation computed from the rate of strain tensor norm , @xmath45 , and from the kinetic energy differentiation , @xmath46 , coincide perfectly .",

    "numerous numerical experiences have been conducted to understand accurately the dynamic of the taylor - green vortex flow at this reynolds number . as mentioned in @xcite , all the scales of the flow",
    "are captured with @xmath49 degrees of freedom but @xmath50 degrees of freedom are sufficient to represent its main characteristics .",
    "we therefore run the divergence - free wavelet based simulation on a @xmath50 mesh grid .",
    "we also performed a fourier pseudo - spectral simulation with a dealiasing procedure at the same resolution . on figure [ energyfig1600 ] we displayed for both simulations the kinetic energy and dissipation rate time evolutions . on the same figure , for comparison purpose",
    ", we also plotted the curves corresponding to a @xmath49 fourier modes pseudo - spectral solution ( with dealiasing ) available from @xcite .",

    "slight discrepancies appear in the decaying phase starting after the dissipation peak ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "those experiments show that the divergence - free wavelet based method provides results of comparable quality to those obtained from pseudo - spectral simulations at identical resolutions .",
    "the wavelet simulation performed on the @xmath50 mesh grid will serve as a reference \" dns  for comparison purpose .",
    "we relied on this method to carry out all the numerical simulation performed in this study .",
    "the performances of various subgrid modeling are discussed in the next section .",
    "one of the main advantages of the stochastic formalism we propose lies in the great flexibility of the anisotropic diffusion specification .",
    "the variance tensor , @xmath53 , can be fixed from _ a priori _ shape imposed either directly on the small scale variance or on the diffusion tensor . in some cases , such knowledge",
    "could probably be inferred from the physical approximations considered to constitute the model .",
    "aspect ratio simplifications and/or boundary conditions that are not perfectly known could be used as well to constrain the small - scale velocities to live on specific iso - surface .",
    "another route would consist in specifying the turbulent velocity components from small - scale measurements statistics .",
    "despite all those directions are worth exploring as they open new strategies to design sub - grid tensors , in this study we choose to focus on several simple models of tensor @xmath54 to explore the potential of the proposed modeling .",
    "the first model consists in assuming ergodic assumption to compute the variance tensor from local statistics of the resolved velocity component .",
    "the variance tensor is here defined from empirical velocity covariance computed on a local neighborhood : @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the empirical mean on a spatial or temporal window @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the spatial scale considered for the simulation , which corresponds to a mesh grid composed of @xmath59 grid points , and @xmath44 is the kolmogorov scale .",

    "they are referred to as the spatial and temporal local covariances respectively .",
    "both models are weighted by the variance tensor scale ratio derived in section [ section - scaling ] .",
    "the second model is defined from two successive filtering of the resolved velocity component and a scale similarity assumption .",
    "the filtering is defined through the associated wavelet multi - scale projector .",
    "more precisely , since the velocity @xmath64 can be decomposed as : @xmath65+\\sum_{|\\boldsymbol j| \\ge |{\\boldsymbol \\ell}|}{\\cal q}_{\\boldsymbol j}[{\\boldsymbol{w}}(\\x , t)],~~{\\cal q}_{\\boldsymbol j}={\\cal p}_{\\boldsymbol j+1}-{\\cal p}_{\\boldsymbol j},\\ ] ] with @xmath66 the projector onto the scaling functions basis @xcite , the resolved filtered velocity @xmath67 is defined by : @xmath68.\\ ] ] the second , so called `` test '' , filtering is here defined by the projection of @xmath69 onto resolution @xmath70 , which is the immediate coarser resolution following the simulation scale : @xmath71.\\ ] ] the stochastic navier - stokes equations ( [ eqinitialsyst1 ] ) rewritten respectively for @xmath72 and @xmath73 reads : @xmath74 and @xmath75 taking the difference of the momentum equations and for the two subsequent levels @xmath76 and @xmath77 provides the residual dynamics : @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . note that a similarity assumption @xmath82 has been imposed for the variance tensor . it can be noticed that , if the projector @xmath83 commutes with differentiation , due to the filtering projection property , the stokes equation in the left - hand side cancels after filtering . then , instead of solving the right - hand expression at level @xmath77 and then projecting back at a finer level the estimated variance tensor , we rather propose to solve it at scale , @xmath84 , in a least squares sense . introducing the variance tensor incompressibility constraint",

    "an important remark can be raised here .",

    "it is thus not relevant to correlate the large - scale solutions with the filtered velocity .",
    "it is more meaningful to compare them directly with the dns .    from the rate of strain tensor norm displayed on the right side of figure [ energyfigles ] , two groups of subgrid tensor can be recognized .",
    "the first one gathers the dynamic smagorinsky tensor ( dyn - s ) and the variance tensor defined from the spatial local velocity covariance ( spatial ) .",
    "the second group is composed of the optimal variance tensor with a scale similarity assumption ( opt - ss ) and the variance tensor built from the velocity temporal covariance ( temporal ) . for both groups , we displayed on the right - hand side of figure [ energyfigles2 ] and figure [ energyfigles3 ] the energy dissipation rate computed from the kinetic energy rate of change .",

    "the turn - over time ratio for two different scales in this range , @xmath187 , exhibits a direct relation between a change of time scale and a change of spacial resolution . a coarsening in time yields thus a space dilation .    besides , at scale @xmath58",
    ", we have : @xmath188 at the smallest scale , this quantity corresponds to the variance tensor @xmath189 .",
    "we have thus : @xmath190 within a given cell , @xmath191 , at scale @xmath58 , the energy of the small - scale random field is given as : @xmath192 which from ( [ eq1 ] ) gives us : @xmath193 this relation provides us an expression of the scaling between the subgrid variance tensor at scale @xmath58 and the resolved velocity anomalies",
    ". it will serve us to impose a proper tuning of the subgrid term when the variance tensor is defined from the resolved velocity .      considering",
    "the scaled coordinates @xmath194 , @xmath195 , with velocity @xmath196 , pressure @xmath197 and a variance tensor @xmath198 , we have : @xmath199 @xmath200 assuming , as in the previous section , that the characteristic value of the resolved variance tensor , @xmath201 , depends linearly on the variance tensor at the smallest scale , @xmath202 , the dimensionless form of the large - scale stochastic navier - stokes equations reads : @xmath203 where we introduced a dimensionless number @xmath204 which relates the typical kinetic energy at scale @xmath58 to a characteristic value of the velocity variance , @xmath205 , at the same level . in this expression we considered from ( [ scaling ] ) a characteristic value of the resolved variance tensor @xmath206 where we introduced a scale factor ratio , @xmath207 ( with k(1)=1 ) .",
    "as previously inferred , under the kolmogorov scaling hypothesis this ratio scales as @xmath208 .",
    "let us finally observe that for a typical variance tensor , @xmath202 , tending to zero , ( [ d - nsu ] ) tends to the original navier - stokes equations .",
    "it is the situation occurring when the variance tensor is negligible in front of the drift energy .    in the next section",
    "we will see that the large - scale model proposed conserves the invariance properties of the original navier - stokes equations .",
    "let us consider in the following the classical symmetry groups of the incompressible navier - stokes equations in a periodic domain and in the absence of external forcing .",
    "space translation invariance is achieved if the whole velocity field @xmath209 is still a solution of the navier - stokes equations . in our setting",
    "we have @xmath210 separating the brownian component from the smooth term yields : @xmath211 , @xmath212 and hence @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 , and translational invariance follows immediately .",
    "time - shift invariance is obtained recalling that brownian motion has itself a time - shift invariance property .",
    "this property allows us to write ( in law ) for @xmath218 : @xmath219 which leads straightforwardly to time - shift invariance .",
    "these two symmetry groups correspond to a constant rotation or to a reflection of the coordinates system .",
    "the transformed coordinates are @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "note that @xmath222 , which yields @xmath223 and hence @xmath224 .",
    "the invariance of the transformed navier - stokes equations follows immediately : @xmath225      a model is said to be galilean invariant if it is invariant with respect to an inertial transformation of the representation frames : @xmath226 .",
    "the velocity in this translated non - accelerating system of reference reads @xmath227 with @xmath228 from those equations we obtain : @xmath229 as the pressure and viscous force are galilean invariant and since @xmath230 , this shows the system is galillean invariant .",
    "as with the original navier - stokes equation , the stochastic model is not invariant to a time reversal transformation : @xmath231 .",
    "this property is respected only for the euler equation . despite the time reversibility property of brownian motion",
    "this loss of symmetry is due to the even nature of the quadratic tensor .",
    "considering the scaled transformation : @xmath232 we get : @xmath233 the two last relations highlight a very interesting property of the modified navier - stokes equations . when the viscosity can be neglected in comparison to the variance tensor ,",
    "the large - scale stochastic navier - stokes equations become scale - invariant for any values of the scale exponent .",
    "they share this property with the euler equations .",
    "when the friction term is considered the equations are invariant only for @xmath234 .    to sum up",
    ", the large - scale stochastic representation of the navier - stokes equations have the remarkable feature of keeping all the symmetries of the original equations and to follow the same scale invariance property as the euler equation when neglecting the friction term .",
