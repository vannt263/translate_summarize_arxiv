    "the clustering of galaxies has long been used as a fundamental measure of the large - scale structure of the universe . clustering measures place strong constraints on galaxy formation and evolution models and provide estimates of the average or minimum parent dark matter halo mass of a given galaxy population , allowing placement in a cosmological context ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "locally , large surveys such as the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have measured the two - point correlation function of galaxies precisely enough to allow detailed halo occupation distribution ( hod ) modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a simple interpretation is that brighter galaxies reside in more massive dark matter halos , which are more clustered in the standard theories of hierarchical structure formation .",

    "small deviations from a power law have recently been detected on scales @xmath21 and can be naturally be explained in the hod framework as the transition between pairs of galaxies within the same halo ( the ` one - halo ' term ) on small scales and galaxies in different halos ( the ` two - halo ' term ) on larger scales @xcite .",
    "the largest deviations are seen for the brightest galaxy samples , with @xmath8 .",
    "these galaxies are generally found in groups and clusters , which have larger ` one - halo ' terms due to the many galaxies residing in a single parent dark matter halo and therefore have a steeper correlation slope on small scales .",
    "lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath22 also display a luminosity - dependence in their clustering properties @xcite .",
    "the large - scale bias of lbgs ranges from @xmath23 , depending on the luminosity of the sample .",
    "there is also a strong scale - dependence to the bias on small scales , where the correlation function rises sharply below @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this rise has been interpreted as evidence for multiple lbgs residing in single dark matter halos at @xmath25 .    in this paper , we present results on the luminosity - dependent clustering of galaxies at @xmath12 , using the nearly - completed deep2 galaxy redshift survey .",

    "luminosity - threshold samples are preferred for hod modeling , as theoretical predictions for hods have been studied more extensively for mass ( luminosity ) thresholds and afford fewer parameters to fit than differential bins ( for details see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this case the hod has a relatively simple form , e.g. , the mean occupation function is a step function ( for central galaxies ) plus a power law ( for satellites ) .",
