    "the universally accepted scenario for the formation of cosmic structures in the universe is based on the mechanism of gravitational instability , which assumes that the density fluctuations generated at some early epoch grow by accreting mass from the surrounding regions through gravitational processes .",
    "the origin of these cosmological seeds is generally related to the final phases of the inflationary expansion for which a large variety of theoretical models exist in the literature ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "these models originate perturbations having different statistical properties , usually investigated in terms of probability distribution function ( pdf ) and correlation functions / power polyspectra . in particular , the most standard slow - rolling models , where a single field is responsible for the inflationary accelerated expansion , produce fluctuations having almost uncorrelated phases .",
    "for this reason in cosmological studies it is usual to assume that the primordial perturbations are gaussianly distributed , which leads to the further simplification that their complete description is possible using the power spectrum only .",
    "however , even the simplest inflationary models allow for small departures from gaussianity , which can become more significant in non - standard models , like the scenarios based on the curvaton , the inhomogeneous reheating and the dirac - born - infeld inflation ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the observational determination of the amount of non - gaussianity present in the primordial fluctuations is now considered not only a general probe for the inflationary concept , but also a powerful discriminatory test between its various theoretical models .",
    "given the infinite variety of possible non - gaussian models , it is necessary to introduce a simple way to quantify the level of primordial non - gaussianity . in the recent years",
    "it has become standard practice to adopt the dimensionless non - linearity parameter @xmath0  ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , measuring the importance of the quadratic term in a sort of taylor expansion of the bardeen s gauge - invariant potential @xmath10 , namely @xmath11 here @xmath12 represents a gaussian random field . in particular , in this paper we follow the so - called large - scale structure ( lss ) convention , where @xmath10 , that on scales smaller than the hubble radius corresponds to the usual newtonian peculiar potential ( but with changed sign ) , is linearly extrapolated to the present epoch .    for many years , the study of the statistical properties of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has been considered the most efficient way to measure @xmath0 .",
    "in fact its temperature fluctuations are directly related to the density perturbations in a regime in which the non - linearities originated by the subsequent process of gravitational instability are not modifying their primordial characteristics , including the pdf .",
    "different statistical estimators have been applied to the most recent data , keeping improving constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "so far the more stringent results come from the analyses of the 5-years _ wmap _ dataset : assuming a local shape for non - gaussianity ( as we will do in this paper ) , @xcite found that @xmath0varies between -12 and 145 , while @xcite found @xmath13  lss - convention adopted here.](see also the positive detection of non - gaussian features reported by * ? ? ?",
    "more recently it became clear that the lss represent an alternative tool , potentially as valid as the cmb to constrain @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , deviations from an initial gaussianity induce a different timing for the whole process of structure formation , providing an interesting framework to look for specific non - gaussian imprints . in general , as already evident from the results of the first generation of non - gaussian @xmath2-body simulations in the early 90s @xcite , if the primordial density field is positively ( negatively ) skewed , the formation is favored ( disfavoured ) and structures of a given mass form at earlier ( later ) epochs .",
    "however , there is an important difficulty in using lss for constraining @xmath0 : the late non - linear evolution introduces additional non - gaussian features that need to be disentangled from the primordial ones . for this reason it has been necessary to have resort to suitable high - resolution @xmath2-body simulations to follow the growth of the lss also in the full non - linear regime , and to calibrate the expected signatures as a function of the primordial non - gaussianity",
    "this has been extensively done in the recent years by different groups ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the results allowed to assess the power of lss as independent probe for @xmath0 , in particular they showed that the most evident non - gaussian signatures are present in the mass function and clustering ( bias and bispectrum ) of dark matter mass haloes ( see also the analytical predictions made by * ? ? ?",

    "being at the top of the hierarchy of structure formation , galaxy clusters are in principle ideal probes for constraining @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , the statistics of fare events , either galaxy clusters or deep voids @xcite are very sensitive to primordial non - gaussianity . however , until now the use of clusters as non - gaussian probes has been hampered by two practical problems : first , the observational estimate of their mass is affected by large uncertainties , whatever are the method and the observational band adopted ; second , it is difficult to build up samples that span a large range of redshift and are also statistically complete",
    ". the first problem can be in some way overcome by using the scaling relations ( expected from theoretical arguments and confirmed by observations ) existing between mass and different observables ( see below )",
    ". the second problem will be solved in the next years , thanks to the efforts of a set of ( in progress or planned ) surveys , which promise to provide large samples of galaxy clusters covering a volume comparable to the horizon size : see , e.g. , des , panstarrs , boss , lsst , adept , euclid .    in this paper",

    "we will take advantage of the fact that , in both cases , the corresponding observables , i.e. the x - ray luminosity and the compton @xmath17-parameter , are related to the mass by well calibrated scaling relations .",

    "we address this problem using numerical rather than analytical tools .",
    "the advantage is twofold .",

    "second , numerical experiments allow us to extract realistic mock cluster catalogs that can be easily used for modeling the observational selection , which is more difficult to account for in a fisher matrix - like approach .",

    "in order to study the possibility of detecting the signatures of primordial non - gaussianity in the lss of the universe we must take into account the complete process of structure formation . for this",
    "we make use of the outputs of two different sets of dm - only simulations , focusing on the distribution of the dm haloes associated to the galaxy clusters , as identified in the different snapshots .    the first simulation set ( presented in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) consists of three dm - only simulations performed with different levels of primordial non - gaussianity , that , expressed in terms of the dimensionless non - linearity parameter @xmath0 , are @xmath0=0 , @xmath18100 ; the case @xmath0=0 corresponds to the standard gaussian case .",
    "the initial conditions were set by assuming a flat @xmath19cdm  model dominated by a cosmological constant with parameters chosen to be consistent with the _ wmap _  three - year results ( * ? ? ?",
    "* _ wmap-3 _  hereafter ) : namely , the density contributions of cosmological constant and matter correspond to @xmath20=0.76 and @xmath21=0.24 , respectively , while the normalization of the power spectrum of density fluctuations is fixed as @xmath5=0.8 , being @xmath5 the r.m.s . matter fluctuation into a sphere of radius @xmath22 mpc .",
    "the three simulations started from the same random generation of initial conditions with the only difference consisting in the different value of @xmath0 .",
    "all the runs , carried out with the @xmath2-body code gadget-2@xcite , followed the evolution of @xmath23 dm particles inside a cubic volume of @xmath24 mpc per side , with each particle having a mass of @xmath25 ; here @xmath26 represents the hubble parameter defined as @xmath27(100 km s@xmath28 mpc@xmath28)=0.7 .",
    "the gravitational force has been computed using a plummer equivalent softening length @xmath29 kpc .",
    "these simulations produced 14 outputs in the redshift range @xmath30 . for each snapshot we produced a catalogue of dm haloes identified using a _ friends - of - friends _ ( fof ) algorithm , adopting a linking length of 0.2 times the mean interparticle distance : with this choice the size of the haloes roughly corresponds to their virial mass , @xmath31 . since in this work we are interested in the x - ray and sz signals produced by galaxy groups and clusters , we only considered dm haloes having @xmath32 . for each halo we kept the information on the mass and the position of its center inside the cosmological volume .",
    "the second set of simulations is the one described in @xcite .",
    "it consists on 7 runs covering a wider range of non - gaussianity : @xmath0=0 , @xmath18100 , @xmath18500 , @xmath181000 .",
    "the main differences with respect to the first set are that the box size is only @xmath33 mpc with @xmath34 particles and that the cosmological model adopted is close to a _",
    "first - year ( * ? ? ?",
    "wmap-1__hereafter ) cosmology , with the following cosmological parameters : @xmath20=0.7 , @xmath21=0.3 , @xmath5=0.9 . for this set",
    "we have 21 outputs in the range @xmath30 and a halo catalogue for each snapshot obtained in the same way as described before and with the same mass limit .",
    "notice that in this paper this last set of simulations will be mainly used to test the impact of different cosmological parameters compared to non - gaussianity : for this reason we will discuss only the results of the most extreme and the gaussian model ( @xmath0@xmath35 ) .",
    "this simulation set will also be used in order to check the effect of the finite box size on our results .      as said in section [ sec : intro ] , in order to study the impact of primordial non - gaussianity on the lss we adopt an observationally - oriented approach . to this purpose",
    "we use the halo catalogues described in section [ ssec : simul ] to produce mock light - cones by stacking several simulation volumes .",
    "in particular we want to cover the redshift range @xmath36 , which corresponds to a comoving distance of 5249 @xmath37 mpc ( 5019 @xmath37 mpc with the cosmology adopted for the second set ) .",
    "this length requires to stack 5 ( 11 for the second set ) times the simulation box .",
    "however , in order to obtain a better redshift sampling , we divide the simulation volume into slices along the line of sight .",
    "the number of slices varies from cube to cube and their comoving distance intervals are created in order to allow us to use all of the 14 ( 21 for the second set ) snapshots . more precisely , for any given distance from the observer we compute the corresponding time elapsed from the big bang and we choose the snapshot that better approximates this value .    in order to avoid the repetition of the same structures along the line of sight , for every stacked simulation volume we perform a randomization of the halo spatial coordinates : for every cube we randomly choose the axis to put along the line of sight , we assign a 50 per cent probability to reflect each axis and , since our simulations assume periodic boundary conditions , we proceed to a random recentering of the coordinates . in order to preserve the whole information on the structures inside the simulations volume , the slices belonging to the same cube undergo the same randomization process . with this method , which is similar to the one adopted by @xcite",
    ", we obtain 18 different slices belonging to 5 independently randomized cubes ( 31 and 11 for the second simulation set , respectively ) .",
    "this process is repeated with the same initial random seed for all the simulations of the set .",
    "each light - cone produced in this way spans an angle of 13.1 deg ( 5.71 deg for the second set ) per side , determined by the length of the box at the maximum redshift , @xmath38 .    by varying the initial random seeds we can obtain different light - cone realizations that we can use to assess the statistical robustness of our results",
    "for each non - gaussian model , we created 20 ( 100 ) different light - cone realizations , thus covering a total area of 3432 deg@xmath39 ( 3260 deg@xmath39 ) .",
    "however , it is important to note that this area can not be considered as completely independent , being produced starting from the same finite volume of the simulation : as a reference , at @xmath40 the same simulation volume is completely stacked in all realisations , while at @xmath41 we are able to produce about 15 independent volumes crossing the light - cones .    using the whole set of light - cone realizations we compute the mass functions ,",
    "expressed in terms of number of objects per solid angle , for 4 redshift bins .",
    "we show in fig . [",
    "fig : mass_funct ] the results for the three models of the first set ( @xmath0=@xmath42 ) and for the @xmath0=@xmath43 models of the second set .",
    "looking at the @xmath44 bin , the three mass functions of the first set are basically indistinguishable .",
    "the non - gaussian deviations become more evident in the tail at higher masses and at higher redshifts : in the second bin ( @xmath45 ) the @xmath0@xmath9 models introduce a @xmath46 per cent difference in the high mass ( @xmath47 ) cluster counts , which increases to about 10 per cent at @xmath6 .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact the modification of the distribution of the primordial density fluctuations primarily affects the formation of the biggest haloes at early epochs , as already discussed in @xcite .",
    "when comparing the two simulation sets , it is clear that the differences between the various non - gaussian scenarios are very small compared to the ones resulting from the change of the cosmological model . for example , even at @xmath8 the @xmath0@xmath48 model of the first set adds only about 10 per cent counts to the gaussian case ( @xmath49 ) , while the _ wmap-1 _  cosmology scenario predicts more than three times as much objects .",
    "this fact highlights that the uncertainties with cosmological parameters , particularly with @xmath5 , are critical when addressing the problem of detecting primordial non - gaussianities in the lss .",
    "more in the detail , analytical models of the mass functions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict that a difference of @xmath50 in @xmath5 produces a change of about 10 per cent in the total integrated counts ( @xmath49 ) , raising to about 15 per cent at @xmath8 , where the @xmath0  parameter is expected to produce the most significant effects .",
    "this aspect will be considered in the following analyses .",
    "it is worth to note also that for masses higher than @xmath51 the mass functions of the second simulation set steepen and approach the first - simulation ones : this is an artificial effect produced by the smaller box size of the second simulation ( 500 instead of @xmath24 mpc ) .",
    "in fact this causes a loss of power for perturbations at large scales , corresponding to a lower abundance of objects with high masses , and gives an indication of the range of validity of our simulation sets .",
    "since our simulations consider only dm particles , in order to compare our results with present and future cluster surveys we need to define a model to associate the baryonic component to each dm halo .",
    "in particular we will focus here on modeling the x - ray emission ( and the sz signal , described in section  [ sec : tsz ] ) , exploiting observed and predicted scaling relations .",
    "as said in section [ ssec : simul ] , our method provides the virial mass @xmath31 of our clusters , while often scaling relations are published using other mass definitions ( like @xmath52 , @xmath53 and so on ) : therefore , in order to convert @xmath31 to the required value , we assume that our dm haloes follow a nfw density profile @xcite with a concentration parameter @xmath54 given by the @xmath55 relation proposed by @xcite . notice that here we explicitly neglect the presence of any diffuse emission from the igm associated to the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) and concentrate only on signals coming from galaxy clusters and groups .",
    "even if the whim component is expected to contribute significantly to the total lss signal , its presence is not expected to significantly affect the clusters count rate .    in order to associate an x - ray luminosity to a dm halo",
    "we assume the phenomenological mass - luminosity relation found by @xcite , namely @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the luminosity in the [ 0.1 - 2.4 kev ] band and @xmath52 is the mass of the cluster inside a radius enclosing 200 times the critical density @xmath58 of the universe at the redshift of the cluster .",
    "the normalization @xmath59 corresponds to the luminosity of an object with @xmath60 at @xmath61 .",
    "the term @xmath62 represents the redshift evolution of the hubble parameter , @xmath63 while the value of @xmath64 is assumed to correspond to the self - similar evolution case , @xmath65 .",
    "the best - fit parameters @xmath59 and @xmath66 depend on the assumed cosmological model .",
    "@xcite publish their results assuming both @xmath21=0.24 ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) and @xmath21=0.30 ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) , therefore we can take those values as a reference for our first and second simulation sets , respectively .",
    "we also take into account a scatter in the @xmath71 relation that we fix to 17 per cent , as measured by @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will determine the observed clusters fluxes in the [ 0.5 - 2 kev ] and [ 0.5 - 5 kev ] bands to compare our results with the abundances derived from _ rosat _",
    "x - ray clusters survey @xcite and to predict the expected counts for the forthcoming _ erosita_survey @xcite , respectively .",
    "in order to calculate the band corrections , we need to assume the icm temperature that determines the spectral distribution of the emitted radiation . for this purpose",
    "we consider our haloes as isothermal and we use the @xmath72 relation which @xcite obtained from a sample of ten nearby clusters observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ , adding a self - similar redshift evolution .",
    "notice that their sample covers the temperature range 29 kev , so we are forced to extend this relation to smaller objects , where a steepening of the @xmath72 relation is expected .",
    "in fact , @xcite obtain a slope higher of @xmath73 when restricting their sample only the hottest ( @xmath74 kev ) clusters .",
    "even if neglecting this effect may lead to an underestimate of the cluster temperatures for the small objects , we checked that it does not have a strong impact on our final results .",
    "for example , if we assume a further steepening of @xmath75 in colder ( @xmath76 kev ) clusters , this leads to a change of about 1 per cent in the faint - end of the @xmath77-@xmath78 , and the relative differences between the non - gaussian scenarios remain unchanged .",
    "it is known that the icm cools mainly via _ bremsstrahlung _ emission which is the main physical process responsible of the x - ray emission of galaxy clusters .",
    "therefore we can model the emission of the gas assuming a free - free spectrum with a gaunt factor @xmath79 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for more details ) . with this simplifying assumption",
    "we are neglecting the presence of other known emission processes like line - emission from metals , which can give a non - negligible contribution especially to low - temperature ( @xmath80 kev ) clusters ; however , for the reasons explained above , neglecting this process has no significant impact on our final results .",
    "once obtained the band correction @xmath81 , we calculate the cluster flux in a given band as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the luminosity distance of the cluster .",

    "our results are compared with the counts obtained from the _ rosat _  survey , in the same band .",
    "all of the first three models show a good agreement with the data , having error bars much wider than the difference associated to the change of the @xmath0  parameter . on the contrary , the counts obtained with the _ wmap-1 _",
    "cosmology are significantly higher ( even when considering the standard gaussian case ) : the only way to fit the data with these cosmological parameters would be to assume a strong negative evolution of the luminosity with redshift , e.g. adding an extra factor @xmath84 to equation [ eq : l - m ] , with @xmath85 , which is absolutely unrealistic ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these results show that the dependence of the cluster counts on different cosmological parameters , and particularly on @xmath5 , is much higher with respect to the one on the value of @xmath0 : this highlights the difficulty of constraining the level of the primordial non - gaussianity with the current uncertainties in the cosmological parameters .",
    "[ fig : logn - logs ] shows the @xmath77-@xmath78  in the [ 0.5 - 5 kev ] band in different redshift intervals .",

    "however , once again , the dependence on @xmath0is much smaller when compared to the one on the power spectrum normalization @xmath5 : at @xmath8 , the differences in the cluster counts associated to the @xmath0@xmath9 models are comparable to an uncertainty of @xmath93 in @xmath5 ( see the discussion in sect .  [ ssec : lcones ] ) . for what concerns the total integrated counts , the number of objects detectable by the _ erosita _",
    "survey predicted by the gaussian simulation of the second set ( @xmath94 ) grows by a factor of 2 : @xmath95120000 objects , with a similar redshift distribution .",

    "the quoted errors are assumed to be poissonian .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      apart from cluster counts , other global quantities like the average compton @xmath17-parameter  and the tsz power spectrum can be affected by the presence of a non - gaussian signature in the primordial power spectrum of perturbations . in order to study these observables , it is necessary to create and analyse mock maps of the @xmath17-parameter . since galaxy clusters are extended sources , we need to make further assumptions about the density and temperature profiles of the haloes to model the distribution of the signal on the sky . since the tsz signal receives a significant contribution also from the external regions of galaxy clusters , the modelisation must take into account the steepening of the slope of these profiles in the regions around the virial radius ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this context , it is important to note that a classic @xmath97-model @xcite would fail simply because it does not converge for large distances from the centre , even when assuming a decrease of the temperature with a polytropic index , as adopted in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we start from the suggestion of @xcite and slightly modify their results by introducing a rolling-@xmath97 polytropic profile for the tsz signal , namely @xmath98 ^               { -3\\beta_{\\rm eff}(\\gamma-1)/2 } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the angular separation from the cluster centre , @xmath100 is the angular size of the core radius ( assumed to be @xmath101 ) , @xmath102 is the polytropic index of the gas . the effective slope @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the external and internal slopes for the density profile , respectively . in this way",
    "we can tune these two parameters in such a way that this expression converges to the profile of @xcite ( and to a @xmath97-model ) in the inner part , while in the outer part it steepens to allow the value of the integrated @xmath108 to converge to a finite value ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "we choose @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where the latter value is taken in agreement with the analyses of @xcite on the density profiles in the outskirts of simulated galaxy clusters . with this choice of parameters ,",
    "the external part of our @xmath112 profile also agrees with the results of @xcite .",

    ". it is worth to notice that even adopting this profile , the total signal up to @xmath115 is only the 93 per cent of the total signal : this indicates that using any other shallower profile would lead to non - negligible biases .",

    "[ fig : maps ] we show the compton @xmath17-parametermaps corresponding to the same light - cone realization , as obtained from the @xmath0@xmath117 simulations of the second set . with these extremely large amounts of primordial non - gaussianity ,",
    "it is possible to recognize the expected behavior : an evidence of more ( less ) clustered signal for positive ( negative ) @xmath0 , compared to the gaussian case .",
    "notice that the average value of the @xmath17-parameter   computed over all the maps of the gaussian simulation with the _ wmap-1 _  cosmology is @xmath118 , while considering a _ wmap-3 _  cosmology ( first set of simulations ) this value drops to @xmath119 , in good agreement with the expected scaling , @xmath120 .",
    "the last figure is also consistent with the results of @xcite who , analysing a high - resolution hydrodynamical simulation @xcite based on the same cosmological model , obtained a value of @xmath121 with about half of the signal originated from the whim ( not considered in this work ) .",
    "notice that the mean values derived for the models with the _ wmap-3 _",
    "cosmology but with @xmath0@xmath48 and @xmath0@xmath122 are @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively , thus comparable within few percent to the gaussian case .              to characterize the statistical properties of the tsz effect , it is important to study its power spectrum at different multipoles , in particular focusing on the angular scales at which the tsz signal is expected to dominate the primary cmb anisotropies ( @xmath125 ) . for the complete set of maps generated as described in the previous section ,",
    "we computed the tsz power spectra , using a method based on fast fourier transforms , adopting the approximation of flat sky ( given the reduced extension of the maps ) and assuming the rj frequency limit . finally , the corresponding averages are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : powersp ] for the different models .",
    "again , when considering the first set of simulations , the differences between models with various values of @xmath0  are very low when compared to the variations related to a change of the cosmological scenario : about 10 per cent in both senses for the @xmath0@xmath126 models , compared to a factor of about 3 when changing @xmath5 and @xmath21 .",
    "this is expected as , given the dependence @xmath127 , the difference in the @xmath5 choice accounts alone for a factor 2.3 , with the remaining difference associated to the @xmath21  parameter . for these reasons",
    ", the perspective of constraining @xmath0  seems to be quite demanding without an independent derivation of the main cosmological parameters .",
    "the presence of a possible non - gaussianity in post - inflationary perturbations has been also claimed by @xcite as a possible explanation of the anomalous values of the tsz power spectrum obtained by the _ bima _ experiment . in particular , @xcite measured an high value of @xmath128 @xmath129k at @xmath130 . according to our results , explaining the _ bima _ results with primordial non - gaussian fluctuations alone ( and keeping @xmath131 ) would lead to values of @xmath0  unrealistically high ( @xmath0@xmath132 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "if slightly higher values of @xmath5 are considered , the tsz power spectrum would agree within @xmath133 with the result obtained by @xcite .",
    "in this context , a positive value of @xmath0 within current upper limits , could also contribute to boost the tsz signal in order to explain these measurements .",
    "for the two simulation sets .",
    "the solid lines refer to the first simulation set ( average of the 20 light - cone realizations ) for the three different levels of primordial non - gaussianity ( @xmath0=0,@xmath18100 ) , while the dot - dashed lines refer to the second simulation set ( average of 100 light - cones , with _ wmap-1 _",
    "cosmology ) for @xmath0=0,@xmath181000 .",
    "the dotted line represents the primary cmb signal calculated using cmbfast @xcite adopting the _ wmap-3 _  cosmology .",
    "the diamonds with errorbars ( @xmath133 ) represent the measurements of @xcite with the _ bima _ experiment.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "from the results presented above it is clear that a significant detection of the signatures of a possible primordial non - gaussianity based on global properties of galaxy clusters ( e.g. number counts , mass functions , etc . )",
    "appears very difficult and well beyond the possibility of current and planned surveys .",
    "the main reason is not only the degeneracy of the results with other uncertain cosmological parameters ( mostly @xmath5 ) , but also the fact that these observables are dominated by low - redshift haloes ( @xmath134 ) where the lss properties of the different non - gaussian models show smaller differences .    for these reasons",
    "the most reasonable strategy to break the degeneracy between @xmath0  and the other parameters can be a study of the evolution with redshift of the cluster counts . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dn_dz ] we show for the different models under analysis the redshift distribution of the objects that will be detected by the _ erosita _  and _ spt _  cluster surveys ( left and right panels ) in the x - ray and tsz , respectively .",
    "looking in more detail at the _ erosita _  results , the cluster abundances at @xmath135 , where the satellite is expected to detect about 15,000 objects ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : erosita ] ) , show a relative difference of about 10 per cent .",
    "therefore , in principle , the possibility of estimating , thanks to a dedicated follow - up campaign , a high number of redshifts for the objects detected by _ erosita _  at @xmath136 , would allow to obtain their redshift distribution , increasing the chance of constraining @xmath0 , once the value of @xmath5 is derived using the abundance of low - redshift objects .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn by looking at the redshift distribution of the _ spt _",
    "clusters ( right panel ) .",
    "the possibility of detecting very high - redshift ( @xmath8 ) clusters with an sz survey is certainly promising , since in this redshift range the relative differences grows to @xmath137 per cent .",
    "however , the possibility of obtaining a significant amount of redshift estimates for these objects ( which are @xmath138 , see section  [ sec : tsz ] ) is of course much lower , due to their lower signal .",
    "in this work we used a set of cosmological @xmath2-body simulations to investigate the impact of primordial non - gaussianity ( parametrised in terms of @xmath0 ) on the lss . from their outputs we constructed halo catalogues at different redshifts and , making use of suitable scaling relations between masses and observables",
    ", we computed their expected x - ray emission and sz signal .",
    "in particular we investigated the possibility of constraining @xmath0  with future projects , namely _ erosita _  and _ spt _  cluster surveys .",
    "moreover we discussed the degeneracy with other uncertain cosmological parameters , like @xmath21and @xmath5 .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows .    1 .",
    "as predicted by analytical models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the main effects in cluster counts due to the presence of some level of primordial non - gaussianity are for high masses and redshifts . in particular , for haloes with @xmath90 at @xmath8 , the differences with respect to the corresponding gaussian models are about 20 per cent .",
    "2 .   when the power spectrum normalization suggested by _ wmap-3 _  is adopted , models with a moderate level of non - gaussianity ( @xmath0=@xmath139 ) well reproduce the observed cluster counts derived from _ rosat _  cluster survey .",
    "however , the dependence on @xmath0  is very weak , when compared to the one on @xmath5 , which must be independently estimated to fully exploit cluster counts as a probe of primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "we predict the expected number and redshift distribution of the galaxy clusters that will be detected in two future cluster surveys : _ erosita _  ( x - ray ) and _ spt _  ( sz ) .",
    "the effects due to a moderate primordial non - gaussianity are in general of few per cent , reaching about 20 per cent only at high @xmath140 . in general , the fact that it is easier to detect high-@xmath140 objects with sz observations , because of the absence of cosmological dimming , makes _ spt _  a more promising probe for obtaining constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "however , once again , the results show a strong degeneracy between @xmath0  and other cosmological parameters .",
    "similar conclusions can be also drawn when analysing the power spectrum of the tsz signal produced by galaxy clusters .",
    "4 .   on the whole ,",
    "the best strategy to detect the signatures of primordial non - gaussianity in the lss is to perform deep cluster surveys , together with suitable optical follow - ups for the determination of their redshifts . with this kind of observational dataset",
    ", it would be possible to constrain @xmath5 using low - redshift objects and analyse the @xmath141 in the range @xmath142 to constrain the value of @xmath0 .",
    "if with this method future surveys will allow to reduce the uncertainties on @xmath5 to about 0.01 , this would make possible to detect moderate non - gaussianities of the order of @xmath0@xmath9 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the results of this paper confirm the power of statistical tests based on galaxy clusters as a probe for primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "in particular the detection of objects in the high - mass tail at sufficiently large redshift , as possible in future sz wide surveys like _ spt _ , will be certainly useful to improve the constraints on @xmath0  coming from alternative methods , like cmb , isw and galaxy biasing .",
