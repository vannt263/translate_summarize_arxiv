    "<S> in 1924 david hilbert conceived a paradoxical tale involving a hotel with an infinite number of rooms to illustrate some aspects of the mathematical notion of `` infinity '' . in continuous - variable quantum mechanics we routinely make use of infinite state spaces : here we show that such a theoretical apparatus can accommodate an analog of hilbert s hotel paradox . </S>",
    "<S> we devise a protocol that , mimicking what happens to the guests of the hotel , maps the amplitudes of an infinite eigenbasis to twice their original quantum number in a coherent and deterministic manner , producing infinitely many unoccupied levels in the process . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol by experimentally realising it on the orbital angular momentum of a paraxial field . </S>",
    "<S> this new non - gaussian operation may be exploited for example for enhancing the sensitivity of n00n states , for increasing the capacity of a channel or for multiplexing multiple channels into a single one .    </S>",
    "<S> the `` hilbert hotel paradox '' demonstrates the counterintuitive nature of infinity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hilbert hotel has infinitely many rooms numbered @xmath0 , all of which are currently occupied . </S>",
    "<S> each new visitor that arrives can be accommodated if every current guest in the hotel is asked to move up one room ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> even if a countably infinite number of new guests arrives at once , they can still be accommodated if each of the existing occupants moves to twice their current room number ( @xmath2 ) leaving the odd - numbered rooms free .    </S>",
    "<S> we may ask whether such phenomena can exist physically . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is in continuous - variables systems where in principle we have infinite ladders of energy eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> previously  @xcite , the first of the hilbert hotel paradoxes ( with a single new guest ) was proposed in cavity qed using the sudarshan - glogower bare raising operator @xmath3 that shifts all the amplitudes up one level leaving the vacuum state unoccupied . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show how we can implement the extended case where every second level of an infinite set of states is vacated . </S>",
    "<S> this can be performed coherently and deterministically , preserving all the initial state amplitudes by remapping them to twice their original levels using a short and simple sequence of instantaneous , dynamic , and adiabatic processes .    </S>",
    "<S> we first show how to map the eigenstate amplitudes of a infinite square potential well to twice their original level , and then we report results of a physical implementation of an analogous protocol on the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) eigenstates of light , where we coherently multiply any linear superposition by a fixed integer ( in our case , by three ) . in the supplementary material </S>",
    "<S> we describe further details of the experiment and we show that the square well protocol can be generalised to implement a multiplication of the eigenstate numbers by any positive integer , not only by two .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a quantum system with an infinite ladder of energy eigenstates bounded from below , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> an arbitrary state can be then represented as @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> our earlier work  @xcite has introduced the hilbert hotel operator @xmath6 , transforming @xmath7 to @xmath8 our new aim is to extend the toolbox by an operator @xmath9 , @xmath10 representing the second hilbert hotel paradox by leaving every second energy level vacant .    </S>",
    "<S> both operators are non - unitary isometries , as @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that we can deterministically implement @xmath9 on a infinite square potential well with initial width @xmath12 with the following operations ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : protocol ] ) : _ i _ )  we instantaneously expand the well from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , _ ii _ )  </S>",
    "<S> we let it evolve for the original fundamental period , _ iii _ )  we divide the well into two sub - wells of width @xmath12 with a barrier , _ iv _ )  we let each half - well evolve with a relative potential offset , to correct the relative phase , _ v _ )  we merge the half - wells together into one well of width @xmath13 , _ vi _ )  </S>",
    "<S> we adiabatically shrink the well back to width @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the amplitudes of an initial state can be mapped to any integer multiple ( @xmath14 ) using a slightly modified procedure ( see supplementary material for details ) .     within an infinite square potential </S>",
    "<S> well . * b * , we instantaneously expand the well to twice its original width . </S>",
    "<S> the original wavefunction is not immediately changed but the eigenbasis is different . * </S>",
    "<S> c * , we allow free evolution for a period corresponding to the original fundamental period . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunction is reflected around the centre of the expanded well , with an undesired phase shift . * </S>",
    "<S> d * , we insert an infinite barrier in the centre ( where the wavefunction is zero ) to split it into two independent wells that evolve separately , an energy shift on one well corrects the relative phase . * </S>",
    "<S> e * , after the phase correction we align the potentials and merge the two halves back together . </S>",
    "<S> * f * , an adiabatic compression of the well maps the eigenstates of the expanded well to those of the original well . the original wavefunction has now been halved and reflected , corresponding to the hilbert hotel operation </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 being applied to the eigenstates @xmath15.[fig : protocol],width=288 ]    ideally steps _ i _ , </S>",
    "<S> _ iii _ and _ v _ should be instantaneous while step _ vi _ should be adiabatic . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity of a physical implementation will depend on the accuracy of the timing and the quality of the approximations , especially the maximum effective excitation number @xmath16 of the initial state in comparison to the validity regime of the schrdinger equation approximation in any realistic system under consideration .    </S>",
    "<S> the hilbert space of a particle in a well of width @xmath12 consists of the set of square - integrable functions , @xmath17 and the free particle hamiltonian is @xmath18 with boundary conditions @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this describes a one - dimensional particle in an infinite square potential well , but it can also describe other situations , e.g. an ideal two - dimensional optical waveguide within the paraxial wave approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian yields an infinite ladder of nondegenerate energy eigenfunctions of the form @xmath20 with eigenvalues @xmath21 where @xmath22 . the desired operation @xmath9 transforms an initial state @xmath23 into @xmath24 interleaving the amplitudes of the initial state in the energy eigenbasis with zeros .    </S>",
    "<S> the first step of the hilbert hotel protocol is to double the width of the well so the original wave function @xmath25 extends from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , filling the new interval by constant zero . </S>",
    "<S> we denote this extended wave function by @xmath28 and the free hamiltonian with the new boundary conditions @xmath29 by @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this hamiltonian has a new set of eigenfunctions @xmath31 which we use to express @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> we allow @xmath28 to evolve over a time @xmath33 into @xmath34 where @xmath35 is @xmath36 for even @xmath16 and @xmath37 for odd @xmath16 , thus @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the identity operator and @xmath40 the mirror reflection ( or parity ) operator . therefore , after step </S>",
    "<S> _ ii _ we have ( up to a global phase factor ) the state @xmath41    this resembles the point symmetry extension of @xmath25 to @xmath27 but the phase factor in @xmath42 needs to be corrected . steps _ iii _ , _ iv _ and _ v _ remove the undesired @xmath43 factor while preventing cross - talk between the two sub - wells . after splitting the interval @xmath27 in two , </S>",
    "<S> each part will evolve separately under the hamiltonian @xmath44 with appropriate boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the two halves can be phase - matched by applying potentials @xmath45 in @xmath26 and @xmath46 in @xmath42 for a time @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> after removing the barrier ( step _ v _ ) , the wave function of the system becomes @xmath48 substituting for @xmath49 from , we find that both branches allow for a common analytic expression , as the domain of @xmath31 is twice that of @xmath49 : @xmath50    the final step is an adiabatic compression of the well back to its original width @xmath12 . up to a relative phase due to free evolution , which can be corrected by matching the total time of the evolution to an integer number of full revolutions of the running eigenbasis , this adiabatically </S>",
    "<S> transforms the basis states @xmath31 into @xmath49 of the same @xmath16 , keeping coherent superpositions intact . </S>",
    "<S> this shows the resulting state is indeed .        </S>",
    "<S> the crucial step in the hilbert hotel operation is the coherent mapping @xmath51 ( for @xmath52 ) on a countably infinite set of basis states @xmath53 , as described above . instead of a particle in an infinite square potential well , we can use systems that share important characteristics in order to perform analogous operations . in our experimental realisation ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hhsetup ] ) we choose the set of oam eigenstates of a beam of light , denoted by @xmath54 , and the coherent multiplication makes use of two well - known optical devices in a novel configuration : an oam sorter and a `` fan - out '' refractive coherent beam copier  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the oam multiplier has four steps : _ i _ ) unwrapping the initial azimuthal phase ring into a linear phase ramp with a polar - to - cartesian mapping , _ ii _ ) branching out new copies of the linearised field and correcting their relative phase with a suitable grating , _ iii _ ) demagnifying the juxtaposed copies with a cylindrical lens , and _ iv _ ) wrapping the resulting field back to polar coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of these four steps amounts to the transformation : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number of copies produced in step _ </S>",
    "<S> ii_. the first step is achieved by way of an oam sorter  @xcite , which unwraps any oam mode into a linear gradient ( and therefore it turns a combination of oam modes into a combination of linear gradients ) by way of an extremely astigmatic lens @xmath57 followed by a phase - correcting element @xmath58 , which effectively stops the unwrapping after the transformation is complete . </S>",
    "<S> these two elements can be described by the phase delay that they impose on the incoming field as a function of position : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the focal length of the fourier lens connecting near - field and far - field , @xmath61 is the wavelength of the light beam , and the free parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 determine the scaling and position of the transformation in the fourier plane of coordinates @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    at this point </S>",
    "<S> we produce equal - weighted copies of the unwrapped phase ramp using a fan - out element by way of a suitable 1d phase grating on the far field . </S>",
    "<S> it is crucial that the copies have the same intensity in order to obtain the desired oam modes at the end of the process . in our experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the fan - out grating produces three copies and the equation describing the phase delay of the grating as a function of position in the far field is @xmath66,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> such a phase mask does not depend on the @xmath68 coordinate , as we are copying a linear field . </S>",
    "<S> this grating is displayed on a spatial light modulator ( slm ) , so the output of the sorter needs to be fourier transformed onto the fan - out slm with a @xmath69 system , followed by another @xmath69 system which images it through a second sorter operated _ in reverse_. in order to wrap the field back correctly without leaving wide gaps or without wrapping more than necessary , we use a cylindrical lens to demagnify the horizontal cartesian coordinate before the beam enters the reverse - sorter . exploiting the flexibility of slms </S>",
    "<S> , we achieve this by adding the phase of a cylindrical lens directly on top of the fan - out grating .    in the first part of our experiment we test the coherence of the protocol , i.e. its ability to preserve superpositions . </S>",
    "<S> to do this , we generate balanced superpositions of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , with @xmath72 ranging from 1 to 3 . </S>",
    "<S> such initial modes display @xmath73 maxima , or `` petals '' . </S>",
    "<S> we feed them to the multiplier ( here set to multiply by @xmath74 ) and a successful protocol results in @xmath75 petals with high visibility at the output , as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ petals ] .     * coherent oam multiplication . * </S>",
    "<S> top row : near field of input coherent superpositions . </S>",
    "<S> bottom row : tripled output states . </S>",
    "<S> the number of petals is @xmath75 , as expected from a coherent operation.,width=288 ]    * oam multiplication performance . </S>",
    "<S> * for each input eigenmode we measure the composition of the multiplied output . </S>",
    "<S> circle size is linearly proportional to the overlap with the output modes . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen , the small leakage onto the neighbouring output modes is contained within a few adjacent modes . </S>",
    "<S> a sufficiently distant input superposition such as @xmath76 would maintain an effective orthogonality.,width=288 ]    in the second part of our experiment we assess the accuracy of the protocol by measuring the leakage onto neighbouring oam eigenmodes . to do this </S>",
    "<S> , we multiply single oam eigenmodes by @xmath74 and projectively measure the oam spectrum of the output . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the overlap decays quickly enough for suitably distant superpositions to maintain their orthogonality ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dataanalysis ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the superposition @xmath76 which ideally maps to @xmath77 , was mapped to a superposition of modes , peaked on @xmath78 , but nevertheless with negligible cross - talk ( details in supplementary material ) .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we showed how to implement the hilbert hotel `` paradox '' , where the rooms of the hotel are the excitation modes of an infinite square potential well . </S>",
    "<S> we then reported the successful implementation of the core step of the operation ( the coherent multiplication of the basis states of a countably infinite basis ) on the oam eigenmodes of a paraxial beam of light . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the operation is coherent and that even in our proof - of - principle experiment , the multiplication of sufficiently distant modes can be performed with negligible overlap . </S>",
    "<S> mode multiplication could be implemented also in other quantum systems , such as becs in a box potential with predicted talbot carpet features , though nonlinear interactions may spoil the ideal free particle expansion required for perfect wavefunction mirroring  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , we note that this idea could be used to enhance several state production schemes without the need to modify the existing apparatuses , because it can act as an extension . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , it could prove useful in quantum and classical information processing as a means of multiplexing an arbitrary number of input channels into a single output channel , or to enhance the sensitivity of systems that use n00n states , or to distribute ordered gaps in the spectral profile of a state .    </S>",
