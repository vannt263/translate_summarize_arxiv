    "magnetic resonance effects due to switching of spins by a time - dependent magnetic field and relaxation measurements are widely used to study magnetic materials .",
    "they may give information about the main mechanism of the magnetization change in samples .",
    "when a magnetic field varies , magnetic materials which exhibit a hysteresis present a characteristic time dependence of the magnetization due to the multiplicity of available metastable states . in many relaxing magnetic systems",
    "the time dependence can be described by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the magnetic viscosity of the system .",
    "the viscosity is a consequence of thermal activation of irreversible domain processes such as the domain wall motion and the nucleation of domains of the reverse magnetization .",
    "the logarithmic change with time @xmath5 is predicted if there is a distribution of energy barriers or time - dependent activation energies present in the material .",
    "a simple debye relaxation @xmath6 arises from a single - barrier activation mechanism @xcite .",
    "the barriers associated with the relaxation process are of two types .",
    "the intrinsic barriers arising , for example , from the magnetic anisotropy contribute to the reversal of magnetization , whereas the barriers due to the pinning of domain walls are generally attributed to the defects in the materials .",
    "both types of barriers are responsible for the pronounced metastability ( hysteresis phenomena ) of magnetic systems .",
    "recent efforts in synthetic chemistry provide a number of low - dimensional magnetic systems that show the slow relaxation of the magnetization , for example , this effect was found in one - dimensional ( @xmath7 ) anisotropic ferrimagnetic chains named as single chain magnets ( scm ) @xcite .",
    "the slow magnetic relaxation in the paramagnetic phase has been observed with ac susceptibility and squid magnetometry measurements in the real quasi-@xmath7 ferrimagnetic compound [ co(hfac)@xmath8nitphome ] @xcite . an arrhenius behavior with the activation energy",
    "@xmath9 152 k , which is of order of the intrachain exchange interaction between alternating co@xmath10 and organic nitphome spins , has been observed for 10 decades of relaxation time and found to be consistent with the glauber model @xcite .",
    "the relaxation was also studied by monitoring the decay of the longitudinal magnetization , which was found to be exponential .",
    "the slow relaxation is governed by the uniaxial anisotropy seen by each spin on the chain and magnetic correlations between the spins .",
    "recently , the ac susceptibility and magnetization in steady and pulsed fields have been measured for the new molecule - based magnetic complexes [ mn(hfac)@xmath0bno@xmath11 ( r = h , cl ) with ferromagnetically ( cl ) or antiferromagnetically ( h ) ordered ferrimagnetic chains composed of s=1 ( biradical ) and s=5/2 ( mn@xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the change in magnetization in these compounds under application of a magnetic field below the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ordering temperature ( t@xmath12=5.5 k ( h ) and t@xmath13=4.8 k ( cl ) ) is a slow dynamical process which presumably originates from their strong one - dimensional character , i.e. because of the weakness of the interchain exchange ( @xmath14 ) interaction in comparison with intrachain ( @xmath15 ) one ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the thermally activated change of the remanent magnetization in [ mn(hfac)@xmath17bno@xmath18 after switching off the field looks quite different from that in [ mn(hfac)@xmath0bno@xmath19 .",
    "figure 1 displays time dependence of the remanent magnetization at 1.5 k for these compounds for comparison . the large value of the relaxation times of both processes and their existence well below @xmath20 lead to the suggestion that these relaxation processes are related to the development and motion of magnetic domains either with a wide distribution of energy barriers ( r = cl ) or a single energy barrier height ( r = h ) .",
    "indeed , the change of the magnetization of [ mn(hfac)@xmath0bno@xmath21 with time during and after application of a pulsed field is controlled by the direct af - fi and inverse fi - af transitions .",
    "for the applied pulse with a duration of 20 ms and amplitude of 4 t , the direct af - fi transition is completed within a time of less than 2 ms .",
    "the high rate of the direct transition is due to the high value of the magnetic field in comparison with the critical field of the af - fi transition ( 0.03 t in steady fields and about 0.2 t in pulsed fields ) . the large relaxation time ( @xmath22500 ms ) after removal of the pulsed field implies very slow dynamics of the magnetization during the inverse transition from the field - induced fi state to the initial af state in zero field .",
    "the slow dynamics of the magnetization in this material was suggested to be be controlled by the domain wall motion along the separate field - unfavorable chains @xcite .",
    "the energy barrier which hampers the reversal of the magnetization is originated by the antiferromagnetic interchain coupling that is reminiscent of the molecular clusters or single cluster magnet ( scm ) where the energy barrier is due to the magnetic anisotropy .    the fast relaxation during the field change and the slow relaxation due to the transitions between the different metastable states involves the release of the magnetic energy which cause local heating .",
    "the process of energy losses in [ mn(hfac)@xmath0bno@xmath18 is likely due to the motion of domain boundaries within the chains and is connected with the coercetivity losses and the radiation of phonons .",
    "finally , the energy of the magnetic system is transformed into the phonon energy , that is , into the heat . due to the magnetic system - bath coupling",
    "we may explain the experiments under the condition of isothermal relaxation , and , as a consequence , in an assumption that self - heating in the magnetic relaxation does not destroy 3d order .",
    "the choice of a proper formalism of the quantum dissipation theory depends essentially on the real physical media and real process of the energy transfer .",
    "the interaction between a quantum system and its environment is the physical factor responsible for the relaxation process in the system .",
    "such a relaxation process can be provided by the environment if it acts as a bath .",
    "this arises the fundamental problem of description of the relaxation dynamics for a system simultaneously interacting with a heat bath and a time - dependent driving field .",
    "the question now arises as to what is a nature of heat bath .",
    "we note that the spin system in the external dc bias field in ac - susceptibility measurements or in the pulsed field in magnetization measurements consists of two weakly interacting parts , i.e. field - favorable ( @xmath23 ) and field - unfavorable ( @xmath24 ) chains .",
    "then , two distinct models for the bath are assumed .",
    "the first one identifies the bath with a crystal lattice ( phonon bath ) . in this case , the energy levels of the bath are populated according to the conventional gibbs distribution .",
    "when a rapidly varying strong pulsed field causes the af - fi transition the spin temperature of the @xmath24 part becomes much higher than the lattice and the @xmath23 part temperatures ( saturation process ) . after the field is off the whole spin quantum system",
    "is driven to the thermal equilibrium characterized by gibbs s density matrix owing to energy exchange between the @xmath23 , @xmath24 systems and the heat bath . following the fundamental bogoliubov s procedure of the contraction of description with the accompanying hierarchy of relaxation times @xcite",
    "we may conclude that the weak interchain interactions are related to long - time relaxation process with the characteristic time equals to the characteristic time scale of the experiment @xmath25 ms .",
    "it is assumed that another interactions , including usual spin - phonon ones , are strong enough and have associated correlation effects with shorter relaxation times , i.e. much smaller than the duration of the experiment .",
    "we should eliminate them as an irrelevant information to characterize the macrostate .",
    "apparently , a possible approach to this irreversible process may be performed within the nonequilibrium statistical operator ( nso ) method largely elaborated by zubarev and co - workers @xcite , which is a large generalization of the gibbs s theory .",
    "the results of the nso analyses will be given by us elsewhere .",
    "the second model of the bath is based on the suggestion that the relaxation process is related with the development and motion of magnetic domains in the field - unfavorable chains @xmath24 in a driving field .",
    "the recent study of the behavior of domain walls in ising ferromagnetic chains yields the following picture @xcite . in zero field",
    "the interface between two domains of oppositely oriented spins , a kink , moves left or right with the probability @xmath26 , which may be interpreted as a random walk .",
    "two such kinks can meet via diffusive motion . once there is only one spin left between two kinks they annihilate with probability @xmath27 in the next time step and",
    "the two domains merge .",
    "switching on the external driving field causes domains with spins parallel to the field to start growing .",
    "the kinks at the end of such a cluster move outwards one step during each time step where the field remains favorable .",
    "if the field switches into unfavorable direction , the cluster shrinks again ( breathing behavior ) . in this process",
    "the small domains and the kinks associated with them will be eliminated rapidly . in the ising model",
    "a domain wall width is simply the lattice constant . on the contrary ,",
    "the domain walls in the heisenberg chains are much wider due to the strong exchange interactions involved .",
    "the closest analog of such wall is the soliton in a magnetic chain @xcite",
    ". therefore another model , appropriate for this domain wall relaxation dynamics , may be applied for the bath . in this model",
    "a quantum system ( the field - unfavorable chain with a kink ) interacts weakly with the environment , i.e. with the nearest surrounding field - favorable chains and the lattice ( fig .",
    "the bath is again considered as a quantum statistical system being at equilibrium .",
    "the domain walls oscillate around their equilibrium position under a varying ac field ( the process far from a saturation ) or move reversibly under a time - dependent pulsed field ( the saturation process ) .",
    "the bath provides an existence of random fields ( langevin forces ) created by the environment which interacts with variables of the quantum system ( langevin dissipative modes ) . due to the system - bath interactions",
    "the domain wall dynamics becomes irreversible and the system relaxes from its initial nonequilibrium state to the equilibrium one when the field is off .    a quantum dissipative theory ( qdt ) with the system - bath interaction being treated rigorously at the second - order cumulant level for reduced dynamics has been recently constructed for open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the theory belongs to a class of widely used quantum master equations , such as the bloch - redfield theory @xcite and a class of fokker - plank ( fp ) equations@xcite , and is valid for arbitrary bath correlation functions and time - dependent external driving fields .",
    "the qdt - fp formulation constitutes a theoretical framework for the present study of dissipative processes in the molecule - based magnetic complexes [ mn(hfac)@xmath28bno@xmath18 .",
    "the key theoretical quantity in a quantum dissipation is the reduced density operator @xmath29 , i.e. the partial trace of the total system and bath composite @xmath30 over all the bath degrees of freedom . for a system dynamical variable",
    "@xmath31 , its expectation value @xmath32 = tr\\left [ a\\rho ( t)\\right]\\ ] ] can be evaluated with the substantially reduced system degrees of freedom .",
    "quantum dissipation theory governs the evolution of the reduced density operator @xmath33 , where the effects of bath are treated in a quantum statistical manner .",
    "the total composite hamiltonian in the presence of classical external field can be written as @xmath34    here @xmath35 is the deterministic hamiltonian that governs the coherent motion of the reduced system density matrix and involves interaction with an arbitrary external classical field @xmath36 .",
    "the system is embedded in a dissipative bath ( @xmath37 ) and the last term in eq.([ht ] ) describes the system - bath couplings , in which @xmath38 are hermite operators of the primary system and can be called the generalized dissipative modes .",
    "the generalized langevin forces @xmath39 are hermite bath operators in the stochastic bath subspace assuming gaussian statistics . without loss of generality , their stochastic mean values",
    "are set to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denote the ensemble average over the initially stationary bath density matrix @xmath42 .",
    "the effects of langevin forces on the reduced primary system are therefore completely characterized by their correlation functions @xmath43 .",
    "they satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath44 , and the detailed - balance and the symmetry relations @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "this admits the meier - tannor parametrization @xmath47 in terms of exponential functions @xcite @xmath48 with the adjustable parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "these parameters are in general complex but , for simplicity , we take @xmath51 to be real and positive .    the frequency - domain symmetry relation reads as @xmath52 , and the detailed - balance relation in terms of spectral functions is @xmath53 . using the generalized bath interaction spectral density function @xmath54 obeying the symmetry relations @xmath55 we have @xmath56 .",

    "the reduced system hamiltonian in the presence of external classical field can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the time - independent , field - free hamiltonian , whereas @xmath72 is the interaction between the system and the external classical field @xmath36 .",

    "the underlining assumption is that the system - bath coupling is not strong enough , which makes the second order cumulant expression reasonable .",
    "it is known that this approximation applies well to most dissipative systems in quantum optics , and to transport in mesoscopic systems @xcite . in the strong system - bath regime a special technique is required , which goes beyond the second order approximation @xcite .    one of the traditional approaches to treat the problem is based on the associated quantum master equations .",
    "it focuses on the relation among various matrix elements of the density operator in the time - independent @xmath82-eigenstate representation and is well suitable for the finite systems .",
    "for larger systems ( spin chains , for example ) the number of many - particle states increases dramatically and we can not generally to solve all the microscopic equations .",
    "however , we can describe the system by macroscopic variables ( domain wall position , total magnetization of a chain ) which fluctuate in a stochastic way .",

    "the eqs.([rle1],[dis],[qt],[qs ] ) will serve as a starting formulations for deriving fp equations for observables of the reference system .",
    "magnetic systems exhibiting relaxation phenomena can be characterized by the complex ac susceptibility , @xmath83 , where the dispersion @xmath84 and the absorption @xmath85 are frequently dependent . before moving on to the technical details of the calculation ,",

    "these features are indicative of a magnetic phase transition of the first order , which occurs through a mixed phase state , from antiferromagnetic ordering of the chain magnetic moments to their parallel alignment in the field - induced state @xcite . in the region of the metamagnetic transition , where the af and fi  phase coexist ,",

    "after the field is switched off , the inverse transition from the field - induced fi state to the initial af state in zero field provides very slow dynamics of the magnetization .",
    "the energy barrier hampering the reversal of the magnetization is originated from the antiferromagnetic interchain coupling .",

    "the domain - wall motion in both the ac and pulsed fields is accompanied by energy losses that causes a local heating of the samples .",

    ", we derive fokker - plank equations for observables of the reference system .",
    "it is known that this well - justified approximation makes applicable the resultant fp equation in a large number of dissipative systems provided the system - bath coupling is not strong .",
    "the qdt - fp formalism has advantages of application convenience and straightforwardness , as well as the ability to address both saturation processes caused by strong magnetic field pulses and processes far from a saturation by a small oscillating ac - field .    the complex magnetic ac susceptibility is calculated within an approach , where the magnetization is controlled by the field - induced sideways motion of domain walls .",
    "the expressions for @xmath86 and @xmath212 have the usual debye form for small frequencies .",
    "> from the maximum of the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility we evaluate the relaxation time that agrees qualitatively with that found from the remanent magnetization data .    in the case of a small oscillating field",
    "the system remains near global equilibrium at all times , whereas a strong long - time driving field changing fast in comparison with relaxation to global equilibrium prohibits the normal evolution towards a boltzmann distribution due to dynamical non - markovian effects . in order to obtain a reliable understanding of the physics of the process",
    "we derive a fp  equation in the framework qdt .",
    "the study of a time relaxation of a longitudinal magnetization shows that it experiences a two - step evolution after the field is switched off .",
    "the first rapid stage ends when the system arrives at the critical state where the magnetic driving force and the coercetive force acting jointly on the domain wall are balanced .",
    "the second slow stage of the evolution corresponds to backward domain wall movement together with damped oscillations around the moving domain - wall center .",
    "the damping is managed by a decay of force - force correlations of langevin dissipative modes acting on the system from the bath .",

    "as a method for expressing the density operator in terms of c - number functions , the wigner functions often lead to considerable simplification of the quantum equations of motion , as for example , by transforming operator master equations into more amenable fokker - plank differential equations . by the wigner function one can express quantum - mechanical expectation values in form of averages over the complex plane ( the classical phase space ) , the wigner function playing the role of a c - number quasi - probability distribution @xmath213 , \\ ] ] where @xmath214 is the operator delta function with @xmath215 , @xmath216 @xmath217 .",
