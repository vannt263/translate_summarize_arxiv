    "the structure functions of hadrons @xmath7 at the small bjorken-@xmath0 region provide unique opportunities to access the gluon dynamics of qcd . at @xmath8 , the structure function",
    "is dominated by the gluon contribution , which may be identified with the pomeron in qcd  @xcite . within the regge theory ,",
    "the elastic ( or diffractive ) forward scattering amplitude is described by the exchange of the vacuum quantum number , which is so called pomeron . assuming the pomeron exchange with @xmath9 and @xmath10 being constants , one can write a two - body scattering amplitude as @xmath11 where the energy @xmath12 and the momentum transfer @xmath13 satisfy the regge kinematics @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the total cross section is expressed by @xmath15 which indicates the cross section of the high energy scattering depends on a single parameter @xmath9 , pomeron intercept .",
    "phenomenologically , hadron - hadron collision as well as photon - hadron scattering at high energies are described very well by the ` soft ' pomeron intercept @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "however , some hard scale @xmath17 enters into the process , situation becomes different .",
    "for example , in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) off the nucleon with the photon virtuality @xmath4 , the pomeron exchange model leads to a form of the structure function @xmath1 as @xmath18 which is valid for the small bjorken-@xmath0 , @xmath19 . in this hard process ,",
    "the experimental data  @xcite is consistent with the ` hard ' intercept @xmath20 for @xmath21 in contrast to the soft pomeron value @xmath16 .",
    "this large value of the intercept is rather consistent with the bfkl pomeron , which is the reggeized two gluon exchange calculated by perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to conclude that the pomeron intercept depends on the scale of the scattering process , @xmath22 , where the scale @xmath17 means , @xmath23  photon virtuality , quark mass , or momentum transfer . indeed",
    ", similar scale dependence is observed in the diffractive photoproduction of light and heavy vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "although we have a clear signal of the transition between ` soft ' and ` hard ' pomerons , we can not calculate such a scale dependence theoretically , because it is extremely hard to obtain the soft pomeron as a solution of the non - perturbative qcd .",
    "recently , the holographic description of qcd has gathered theoretical interests as a tool to calculate the non - perturbative quantities in qcd . using the ads / cft correspondence ( or gauge / gravity in general )",
    ", one may relates the strong coupling gauge theory at the boundary with the classical theory of the gravitation in the bulk ads space in the large t  hooft coupling limit  @xcite .",
    "according to the ads / cft dictionary , the holographic description of qcd may be achieved by the top down approach which originates from the string theory in the higher dimensional space  @xcite , or more phenomenological bottom up approach  @xcite .",
    "the holographic models are applied to phenomenological studies successfully  .",
    "the first study of the pomeron with the gauge / gravity correspondence was done in ref .",

    "@xcite . in those studies , the brower - polchinski - strassler - tan ( bpst ) kernel which represents the pomeron exchange in the ads space",
    "is introduced based on the string theory to describe @xmath4 dependence of the pomeron intercept . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors calculated the nucleon structure function at the small-@xmath0 with the ` super local approximation ' , in which overlap functions ( probability distributions in the ads space ) of the photon and the nucleon are simply replaced with delta functions .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the data , although the validity of this approximation seems to be unclear .    in this paper",
    ", we shall calculate the nucleon structure function at the small-@xmath0 based on the bpst pomeron kernel without resorting the ` super local approximation ' . to do so we use the ads wave functions of hadrons calculated from holographic qcd , and",
    "obtain their coupling to the pomeron in the ads space .",
    "methods to deal with the nucleon properties have been already developed and can be applied to the pomeron exchange .",
    "we demonstrate a consistent holographic description of the structure function , by calculating the pomeron kernel , wave functions of scattering particles , and the pomeron - hadron - hadron three point function , gives excellent results for the small-@xmath0 structure function without any artificial assumptions .",
    "in addition , we calculate the pion structure function at the small-@xmath0 in the same way .",
    "we find @xmath24 at the small-@xmath0 is suppressed compared with the nucleon case . in spite of the lack of the dis data for the pion , one can extract ( model dependent ) information on the pion structure function from the forward electro - production of a neutron @xmath25 with a large rapidity gap  @xcite .",

    "we assume the two - body scattering amplitude @xmath26 for a process @xmath27 at the high energy is given by  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the invariant mass square @xmath30 , and @xmath13 the momentum transfer @xmath31 .",
    "this expression is valid for the near - forward scattering with a condition @xmath14 , and is dominated by the pomeron exchange .",

    "when the hard scale appears in the process like dis , @xmath9 increases up to about 1.4 .",
    "therefore , it is important to discuss how the energy scale of the process changes the pomeron intercept in this model .    in order to see such properties of the pomeron kernel , it is convenient to adopt ` super local approximation ' for the overlap functions  @xcite .",

    "unfortunately , we could not compare our calculations with the data , because the existing parameterizations of the pion structure function may already include large errors .",
    "however , the semi - inclusive dis with a forward neutron production provides ( model dependent ) constraints on the pion structure function , if one assume the pion exchange model for this process .",
    "our calculations are consistent with the data within theoretical uncertainties .    because of the lack of experimental information on @xmath233 , a simple relation between nucleon and pion structure functions",
    "is often used to estimate @xmath260 as  @xcite , @xmath261 this relation simply originates from the difference of the number of the valence quarks in the pion and the nucleon , although it is questionable whether or not this relation can be applied to the small-@xmath0 region , at which the gluon dominates .",

    "it is interesting to see this relation is satisfied almost perfectly , although we can not explain why it holds within our framework .",
    "it is our strong desire to extend the present approach to the hadron - hadron scattering . in this case , the scattering amplitude of hadrons @xmath262 and @xmath263 is given by @xmath264 if @xmath262 and @xmath263 are the same hadron , @xmath265 and @xmath266 have the same distribution in @xmath36 and @xmath37 spaces , respectively . according to our results for dis ,",
    "the pomeron intercept @xmath9 becomes small ( soft ) in case the distribution of the incident and target particles are similar .",
    "therefore , we expect the hadron scattering of the identical particles can be described by the soft pomeron , which is consistent with the phenomenologies .",
    "even if we consider the hadron scattering of the different species , shapes of @xmath265 and @xmath266 in the ads space are not so different .",

    "experimental data of these processes also clearly show the scale dependence of the pomeron intercept . in this case , the quark mass as well as the photon virtuality play roles of the hard scale , in order to apply our framework , it is necessary to evaluate the photon - pomeron - vector meson coupling in the ads space , which is under considerations .",
