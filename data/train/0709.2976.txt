    "in the context of research into nuclear fusion , we studied the plasma surface interaction ( psi ) problem @xcite .",
    "a portion of the plasma confined in an experimental device falls onto a diverter wall , which is a shield made of graphite or carbon fiber composite tiles .",
    "the incident hydrogen plasma erodes these carbon tiles in a process called chemical sputtering .",
    "the erosion produces hydrocarbon molecules , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which affect the plasma confinement .    to solve the psi problem ,",
    "the mechanism of the graphite erosion has been researched using molecular dynamics simulation ( md ) @xcite .",
    "previously , we investigated the psi of graphite surfaces using the modified brenner reactive empirical bond order ( rebo ) potential @xcite . that md simulation showed that if incident energy was 5 ev , almost of all incident hydrogen atoms were absorbed by the graphite surface , while if the incident energy was 15 ev , most incident hydrogen atoms were reflected .",
    "this absorption and reflection can be explained by the chemical reaction between a single hydrogen atom and a single graphene @xcite .",
    "however , the number of absorbed hydrogen atoms seems to be independent of this graphite erosion because although the hydrogen atoms are absorbed by the first graphene on the surface only , multiple graphenes are destroyed simultaneously .",
    "almost all of the absorbed hydrogen atoms are located on one side of the first graphene .",
    "the chemical bond between the first and second graphenes triggers the graphite erosion .",
    "we assume that the momentum of the incident hydrogen atoms , which is considered to be pressure from the point of view of macroscopic thermodynamics , presses the first graphene against the second .",
    "nuclear fusion research must not only consider the hydrogen atom , but also the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium .",
    "it is important to understand the difference in the psi due to these isotopes .",
    "a study of the chemical reaction between a single graphene and a single hydrogen isotope atom showed that the absorption and reflection rates as functions of the incident energy differed from that of the hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "these differences will be also be reflected in the graphite erosion .",
    "moreover , the incident momentum of the hydrogen isotopes differs than that of the hydrogen atoms even if the incident energies are the same .",
    "therefore , the pressure of hydrogen isotopes on the graphite surface is greater than that of hydrogen atoms .",
    "if the chemical bonding between the first and second graphenes , caused by pressure from the incident momentum , triggers the graphite erosion , we would expect that the hydrogen isotopes would accelerate this erosion more than hydrogen atoms would .",
    "we used md simulation to investigate graphite erosion due to the incidence of hydrogen , deuterium , and tritium atoms .",
    "we describe the simulation model and method in  [ ss : simmethod ] . in ",
    "[ ss : result ] , we present and discuss the simulation results .",
    "this paper concludes with a ",
    "[ ss : summary ] .",
    "as the graphite , we located eight graphenes @xcite with an `` abab '' lattice structure parallel to @xmath2@xmath3 plane .",
    "each graphene consisted of 160 carbon atoms measuring 2.13 nm @xmath4 1.97 nm .",
    "the size of the simulation box in the @xmath2 and @xmath3directions equaled that of graphene with the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the inter  layer distance of the graphite was initially 3.35  .",
    "the initial distribution of the momentum of the carbon atoms followed the maxwell  boltzmann distribution at 300 k. during the simulation , only two carbon atoms were fixed to support the base of the graphite .",
    "one was the center atom of the 7th graphene from the surface , and the other was located at the boundary of the 8th graphene .",
    "the graphite surface was oriented to face the positive @xmath5direction .",
    "for the simulation , 500 or more hydrogen or isotope atoms were injected at regular time intervals of 0.1 ps .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3coordinates of the injection point were set at random .",
    "the @xmath5coordinate of the injection point was 60  .",
    "the initial momentum vector ( 0 , 0 , @xmath6 ) was parallel to the @xmath5axis , and was defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the incident energy , and @xmath9 is the mass of the incident particle , which is 1 , 2 , or 3 u for the case of hydrogen , deuterium , or tritium , respectively .",
    "we performed our md simulation under _ nve _ conditions , where the number of atoms , volume , and total energy are conserved , except for the addition of incident atoms and removal of outgoing atoms .",
    "the simulation time was developed using second order symplectic integration @xcite .",
    "the chemical interaction was represented by the modified brenner rebo potential @xcite : @xmath10}^\\mathrm{r } ( r_{ij } )           - \\bar{b}_{ij}(\\{r\\},\\{\\theta^\\mathrm{b}\\},\\{\\theta^\\mathrm{dh}\\ } ) v_{[ij]}^\\mathrm{a}(r_{ij } ) \\bigg],{\\nonumber \\\\ } \\label{eq : model_rebo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the distance between the @xmath12th and @xmath13th atoms .",
    "the functions @xmath14}^{\\mathrm{r}}$ ] and @xmath14}^{\\mathrm{a}}$ ] represent repulsion and attraction , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath15 generates multi  body force . to conserve the accuracy of the calculation , the time step was @xmath16",
    "we performed simulations for incident energies in the range 0.530 ev .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshot5ev ] shows a snapshot of the graphite erosion due to deuterium incidence at 5 ev .",
    "this figure clearly illustrates the erosion process . in the initial short time period ( 5 ps ) , the deuterium atoms are generally absorbed .",
    "this is consistent with previous research findings concerning the chemical reaction between a single deuterium atom and a single graphene .",
    "although the first graphene absorbs many deuterium atoms , no erosion yet occurs . when the first and second graphenes are linked by a covalent bond ( 12 ps ) , the erosion process starts , using the binding energy of the chemical bond between the graphenes .",
    "the graphite erosion then advances to the lower graphenes connected by covalent bonds ( 28 ps ) . for deuterium incident at 15 ev ( see fig . [",
    "fig : snapshot15ev ] ) , although the first graphene reflects almost all of the deuterium atoms ( 2 ps ) , and the chemical bonding between the graphenes results in graphite erosion ( 5 ps ) , as in the case of 5 ev .",
    "this behavior is the same for both hydrogen atoms and hydrogen isotopes .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the chemical bonding between the graphenes is the dominant mechanism in the erosion process , rather than the absorption and reflection at the graphene surface .",
    "c +    we investigated the surface destruction ( amorphization of the graphite surface ) and the erosion yield in our study of graphite erosion .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     next , we address two other important problems .    the first is the problem of graphite interlayer interaction . in this work , although the interaction of a covalent bond is represented by the modified brenner rebo potential model , the graphite interlayer intermolecular force is not included . while the interaction energy between graphite layers is thought to be about 0.01 times that of a covalent bond , its true value is not yet known @xcite .",
    "in addition , when using simple two  body interaction functions , such as the van der waals interaction in the graphite interlayer interaction model , the real graphite `` abab '' structure can not be represented .",
    "therefore , we do not have an intermolecular interaction model that is suitable for graphite .",
    "however , the modified brenner rebo potential generates a strong repulsive force when the interlayer distance is less than 2  .",
    "although the interlayer distance can not be kept at 3.35  , the repulsive force maintains the layer structure of the graphite as long as the graphite is not subjected to a strong external force or high pressure , and its temperature is maintained below the melting point . in his paper on the chemical sputtering of polymer , yamashiro described the importance of the intermolecular attractive force in creating a cluster structure and bringing about thermal deposition @xcite .",
    "however , the intermolecular repulsive force , which maintains the interlayer distance and `` abab '' structure , plays a more important role than the intermolecular attractive force in the graphite structure .",
    "in addition , the hydrocarbon molecules that are produced tend to prefer chain structures to cluster structures . therefore , we determined that it was necessary to investigate the importance of the interlayer intermolecular force in the specific case of graphite erosion .",
    "we have been creating a new intermolecular potential model for graphite interlayer interaction .",
    "this work is essential for comparison with our future work , which will include the graphite interlayer intermolecular interaction .",
    "the second problem relates to temperature control . in this work",
    ", we can achieve steady state graphite erosion without the need to cool the graphite , since heat is conducted to the lower graphenes .",
    "in other words , the lower graphenes act as a heat reservoir .",
    "md simulations generally use a thermostat to provide rapid cooling because of the picosecond  scale simulation time .",
    "consequently , the dynamics of atoms in the simulation differ from those in reality ; for example , they halt the reaction due to a trap on the local potential minimum . moreover , because the rate of heat conduction depends on the interaction potential model among atoms , which represents a realistic interaction , it is fairly realistic but slow , judging from the picosecond simulation time scale , and can not be changed too quickly .",
    "therefore , even if the thermostat were not set to the position where a chemical reaction occurs simply to preserve the realistic dynamics of atoms , sufficient cooling would still not be possible because of the slow rate of heat conduction . therefore , we believe that the steady state of the graphite erosion that we have identified here is a realistic phenomenon , even if the steady state is maintained for a short time only , and the incident flux is very high .",
    "a longer  term steady state would likely be possible using graphite with more graphene layers .",
    "we have studied the graphite erosion process due to the incidence of hydrogen , deuterium , and tritium atoms using md simulation with the modified brenner rebo potential for incident energy @xmath8 in the range 0.530 ev . for @xmath17 , both hydrogen atoms and hydrogen isotopes were generally absorbed by the graphene surface . at @xmath18 , however , almost all of the incident particles were reflected . when the incident particles press the first graphene against the second , erosion of the graphite surface is caused by the binding energy of the chemical bond between the graphene layers .",
    "we evaluated the speed of the surface destruction by calculating the pseudo  radial distribution function @xmath19 , the peak values of which decrease with time .",
    "the maximum value of the pseudo  radial distribution function @xmath20 , which generally indicates the number of @xmath21 c  c bonds , decreased exponentially .",
    "the surface destruction due to the hydrogen isotopes progressed faster than the destruction caused by hydrogen atoms .",
    "moreover , we found a power law between the decay time constant and incident energy , and the scaling exponent seems to be independent of the type of incident particle .",
    "measuring the erosion yields indicated a steady state of the graphite erosion .",
    "the erosion yield flux in the steady state increased linearly with the incident energy , which agreed with experimental results .",
    "the erosion yield flux is almost independent of the type of incident isotope .",
    "observation of the erosion yield start time showed that the erosion due to hydrogen isotopes started earlier than the erosion due to the hydrogen atoms .",
