    "bulk transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmd ) are layered van der waals solids displaying remarkable properties promising both for fondamental research as well as for technological applications .",
    "metallic bulk transition metal dichalchogenides ( tmd ) like nbse@xmath0 , present coexistence of charge density wave and superconductivity @xcite , while insulating tmd ( mos@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 ) are flexible , have high mobilities and are routinely used in flexible electronics .    since the pioneering work of frindt and coworkers @xcite and the successive developments in the fields of mechanical @xcite and liquid @xcite exfoliation , it has been possible to obtain free - standing or supported single - layer tmd .",
    "these monolayers are the inorganic analogue of graphene and display a rich chemistry@xcite that makes them attractive for energy storage applications .",
    "insulating single - layer tmd have much lower mobilities @xcite than graphene , but are nevertheless interesting for nanoelectronics , mainly due to the presence of a finite bandgap .    in this context",
    ", mos@xmath0 is considered one of the most promising materials@xcite .",
    "the most stable polytype of bulk mos@xmath0 is the 2h ( molybdenite ) , where each mo has a trigonal prismatic coordination with the nearby s atoms .",
    "mechanical exfoliation of bulk 2h mos@xmath0 lead to formation of single layer samples with the same local coordination ( here labeled 1hmos@xmath0 ) . in chemically exfoliated samples the situation is different .",
    "in the first step of chemical exfoliation of bulk 2h mos@xmath0 , li atoms are intercalated between the layers .",
    "the li intercalation stabilize a 1 t li@xmath7mos@xmath0 polytype having each mo octahedrally coordinated with the nearby s atoms .",
    "subsequent hydratation with excess water and ultrasonication leads to the separation of the layers via lioh formation and synthesis of large - area single - layer mos@xmath0 samples @xcite .",
    "the properties of chemically exfoliated mos@xmath0 single layers are poorly understood .",
    "recently it has been shown that these samples are actually composed of heterostructures of 1h , 1 t and 1t - distorted ( labeled 1t@xmath6 ) mos@xmath8 phases @xcite .",
    "the 1t@xmath6 phase is a @xmath2 superstructure of the 1 t phase formed by zig - zag chains . remarkably , the three phases cohexist in the same sample and have substantially different conducting properties as the 1 t phase is metallic while the 1h and 1t@xmath6 are insulating@xcite . upon mild annealing at @xmath9 c the 1 t and 1t@xmath6 phase disappear and transform in the 1h one .",
    "exposure to a @xmath10 kev electron beam induces s vacancies @xcite and transforms the 1t@xmath6 phase into the 1 t one@xcite . finally , it is important to remark that chemically exfoliated single layers are covered with absorbates that can play some role in stabilizing one structure or the other .",
    "the dynamical properties of the 1t@xmath6 phase are not understood .",
    "for example , while it is well established that the high energy optical raman spectra of the 1h phase are composed of two prominent peaks , attributed to the e@xmath11 mode at @xmath12 @xmath13 and to the a@xmath14 mode at @xmath15 @xmath13@xcite , little is known on the raman spectra of the 1t@xmath6 phase .",
    "raman measurements @xcite on freshly - prepared single - layers with dominant 1t@xmath6 phase show that the e@xmath11 peak is missing , while at least five additional peaks appear at lower energies ( some of these peaks are labeled j@xmath3 , j@xmath0 , j@xmath4 ) .",
    "nothing is known on the phonon displacements generating these features .    in this work",
    "we study the stability , the electronic structure and the dynamical properties of the 1 t and 1t@xmath6 phases in single layer mos@xmath0 by using density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "we show that the metallic 1 t phase is dynamically unstable .",
    "we find distorted structures with a @xmath2 ( 1t@xmath1mos@xmath0 ) and @xmath16 ( labeled 1t@xmath17mos@xmath0 ) real space periodicities having lower energies then the 1 t one . both 1t@xmath1 and 1t@xmath17 structures are , however , substantially higher in energy then the 1hmos@xmath0 phase ( see fig.[fig : struct ] for a plot of the crystal structure of the different phases ) .",
    "we then fully characterize the distorted 1t@xmath6 phase found in experiments on chemically exfoliated mos@xmath0 , by obtaining its electronic structure , phonon dispersion and raman intensities .",
    "finally , we study catalytic absorption in the 1t@xmath1 phase and show that h adsorbates stabilize the 1t@xmath6 with respect to all the others .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : tech ]",
    "we describe the technical details of the calculation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : oct ] we analyze the stability of octahedral phases with respect to the trigonal prismatic ones and in sec .",
    "[ sec : raman ] we study the raman spectrum of the distorted 1t@xmath1 phase . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : cata ] we study catalytic adsorption of hydrogen and its effect on the structural and electronic properties of the different structures .",
    "the results reported in the present paper were obtained from first - principles density functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation@xcite .",
    "the quantum - espresso@xcite package was used with norm - conserving pseudopotentials and a plane - waves cutoff energy of @xmath18 ry .",
    "semicore states were included in the mo pseudopotential .",
    "the electronic structure calculations were performed by using a @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 electron - momentum grids for the 1 t , 1t@xmath22 and 1t@xmath17 phases , respectively . for the metallic 1 t structure we use an hermitian - gaussian smearing of @xmath23 ryd .",
    "the phonon dispersion of the 1 t phase was calculated by fourier interpulating dynamical matrices calculated on a @xmath24 phonon - momentum grid and on a @xmath25 electron - momentum grid .",
    "the raman intensity calculation for the 1t@xmath6 phase was performed on a @xmath26 electron - momentum grid .",
    "the phonon dispersion calculation for the 1t@xmath1 structure was performed using a @xmath27 phonon momentum grid .",
    "we first investigate the relative stability of 2h and 1 t phases in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] .",
    "as expected , we find that the 1h mos@xmath0 phase is the most stable one , with a lower energy of 0.83 ev / mo atom with respect to the 1 t one . the electronic structure calculation of the 1 t structure in fig .",
    "[ fig:1tpure_el ] shows that this polytype is indeed metallic . differently from the 1h case , here",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is very weak and from now on it will be neglected .",
    "as the energy difference between the 1 t and 2h phases is more then 30 times larger then the 200 - 300 k annealing temperature necessary to transform the 1 t phase in the 2h one , the experimental detection of the 1 t and 1t@xmath6 phases can not be inferred from the total energy difference between the two .",
    "it has been suggested that the 1 t phase is metastable and , as a consequence , an energetic barrier occurs between the two @xcite . to verify this hipothesis",
    ", we calculate the phonon dispersion for the 1 t phase .",
    "we find that the 1 t structure is dynamically unstable ( see fig .",

    ".atomic coordinates with respect to the direct axis for the 1t@xmath1 structure .",
    "the lengths of the two direct lattice vectors of the two dimensional lattice are identified by @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the angle between them @xmath30 .",
    "[ tab : structtprime ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                in 1h mos@xmath0 , at high energy , only two raman peaks are seen , namely the e@xmath11 mode at @xmath12 @xmath13 and the a@xmath14 mode at @xmath15 @xmath13 ( see ref . ) .",
    "the experimental raman spectra of the 1t@xmath6 phase show two main variations with respect to h - polytypes : ( i ) the e@xmath11 peak disappears and ( ii ) five additional peaks occur ( see table [ tab : raman ] ) . due to the reduced symmetry of the 1t@xmath1 structure , we do indeed find several raman active peaks and a very rich spectrum .",
    "the e@xmath31 peak is missing and the additional calculated raman peaks can be associated to the experimental ones with a high degree of accuracy",
    ".     structure along selected directions ]    in our calculation the peak with the largest intensity is the so called j@xmath0 peak at @xmath32 @xmath13 ( @xmath33 @xmath13 in experiment ) .",
    "this mode tends to shorten the distance between the two zig - zag chains and to recover the 1h structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : raman_modes ] ) . in experiments",
    "@xcite this mode has a much larger linewidth then all the others .",
    "this partly explains why the experimental height of the peak is substantially reduced with respect to the raman intensity .",
    "the so called j@xmath3 peak at @xmath34 @xmath13 in experiments is actually composed of two differents phonon modes at @xmath35 @xmath13 distance one from the other .",
    "the one at @xmath36 @xmath13 shifts out - of - plane and in opposite directions each stripe of mo atoms inside the zig - zag chain .",
    "the mode at @xmath37 @xmath13 is an in - plane shearing mode of one stripe of atom with respect to the other inside a chain .",
    "the peaks at @xmath38 @xmath13 and at @xmath39 @xmath13 involve shifts of the s - atom layers with respect to the mo atoms .",
    "the j@xmath4 mode at @xmath40 @xmath13 , in excellent agreement with experiments , tends to break each zig - zag chain in two stripes with a slight out - of - plane component .",
    "the mode at @xmath41 @xmath13 compares favourably with the 358 @xmath13 peak detected in experiments , although in theory it has a too small intensity .",
    "finally , the mode at @xmath42 @xmath13 is nothing else that the usual a@xmath43 mode seen in the 1h polytype .",
    "the agreement between the calculated zone - center energies and the position of raman peaks suggests that the devised structure closely resemble the experimental one .",
    "some disagreement still exists between the calculated relative intensities and the experimental ones .",
    "however , it should be noted that raman spectra on different samples@xcite show substantially different raman intensities , probably due either to the inhomogeneity of the sample composed of several phases or to the presence of adsorbates and vacancies .    finally in fig .",
    "[ fig:1tprimeph ] we show the calculated phonon dispersion of the 1t@xmath1 structure that is dynamically stable , suggesting that an energy barrier does indeed exist between the 1h and the 1t@xmath1 phases and that the 1t@xmath1 is metastable .",
    "structures with respect to the 1h polytype and as a function of h coverage per mo atom ]     at 0 and 0.5 h / mo coverage .",
    "the zero of the energy has been set to the bottom of the conduction band . ]      in order to justify the stabilization of the 1t@xmath6 crystal structure with respect to the 1h one detected in experiments , we study asorbates adsorption on the 1h , 1 t , 1t@xmath1 and 1t@xmath17 phases . single layers mos@xmath0 samples at the end of the chemical exfoliation process are fully covered with adsorbates , due to the hydratation of li@xmath44mos@xmath0 with water .",
    "we focus on the simple case of h adsorption .",
    "we consider @xmath45 supercells of the 1 t and 2h phase , as well as @xmath46 supercells of the 1t@xmath1 unit cell .",
    "we start considering only one h ion at random positions on top of the mos@xmath8 layer and then perform several structural optimizations .",
    "we find that the h ion always binds to an s - atom , similarly to what happens in ws@xmath0 @xcite . indeed , in the absence of adsorbates , a positive ( negative ) charge resides on the mo ( s)-atom @xcite , as it can also be inferred from the relative electronegativity of s and mo .",
    "we then add a second h atom and find that two h atoms prefer to bind to different s atoms .",
    "thus , we consider as starting guess of the structural minimization all the possible way of binding h to different s atoms that are compatible with the supercell size .        by performing structural minimization ,",
    "we find that at all h coverages the 1h structure retains its trigonal prismatic coordination . similarly , even when higher in energy , the h - covered 1t@xmath6 structure never decays into the 1h one , but preserves its zig - zag structure , although the separation between the chains and the bonding inside the chain are affected by h concentration .",
    "this confirms once more that an energy barrier does indeed occur between the 1h and the 1t@xmath6 structures .",
    "finally , we find that the h - covered 1 t structure always decays into the h - covered 1t@xmath6 one , confirming the dynamical instability of the 1 t phase towards the 1t@xmath6 . at large enough coverage , this is also what happens to the 1t@xmath17 structure that also decays on the 1t@xmath6 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : h_stability ] we show the lowest energy configuration of all phases with respect to the most stable configuration of the 1h structure at a given h - coverage .",
    "we find that at h coverages superior to @xmath47 / mo , the 1t@xmath6 phase is more stable then the 1h one .",
    "this suggests that in chemically exfoliated mos@xmath0 monolayers , the samples are divided in h - rich regions where the 1t@xmath6 structure is stabilized and in h - poor regions where the 1h phase is stabilized .    by comparing in details the 1t@xmath6 structures at 0 and 0.5 h / mo coverage ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : h_distorted ] ) , it is seen that upon h adsorption the separation between the chains strongly increases , as the shortest distance between mo atoms on different chains is @xmath48  ( @xmath49  ) at coverage @xmath50 h / mo ( 0.5 h / mo ) .",
    "furthermore at coverage @xmath51 h / mo the mo atoms do not lay on the same plane , as in the undistorted case , but are displaced above or below by @xmath52  .",
    "the increased distance between the chains implies a larger band gap and more insulating character , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_distorted ] .",
    "this agrees with experiments where it was found that the zig - zag chain structure is indeed insulating @xcite .",
    "chemically and mechanically exfoliated mos@xmath0 single - layer samples have substantially different properties .",
    "while mechanically exfoliated single - layers are mono - phase ( 1h phase ) , the chemically exfoliated samples show coexistence of three phases , 1h , 1 t and 1t@xmath1 .",
    "the fact that three phases experimentally coexist could lead to the conclusion that the three pure structures have similar energies .",
    "however , as we have shown in the present work , this is far from being the case , as all octahedrally coordinated phases are much higher ( more then @xmath53 ev / mo ) in energy then the trigonal prismatic one ( 1h ) .",
    "moreover , the pure ( i.e. without adsorbates or vacancies ) 1 t phase is dynamically unstable and undergoes a phase transition , again with with a considerable energy gain ( @xmath54 ev / mo ) , towards the most stable 1t@xmath1 structure composed of separated zig - zag chains .",
    "this finding strongly questions the detection of the pure 1 t phase in experiments @xcite and points to a key role of either adsorbates or vacancies in stabilizing the 1 t metallic structure .",
    "wa have calculated dynamical properties of the lowest energy octahedral structure ( 1t@xmath1 ) and found that it is dynamically stable , suggesting that an energy barrier does indeed exist between the 1h and the 1t@xmath1 , similar to what happens in ws@xmath0 where nudged elastic band calculations @xcite find a @xmath55 ev / mo barrier between the 1t@xmath1 and the 1h phases . by investigating catalitic adsorption on single - layer mos@xmath0 we demonstrate the key role of adsorbates , and ,",
    "more generally , of negative charging of the mos@xmath0 layer , in stabilizing the 1t@xmath1 phase .",
    "this phase becomes the most stable at concentrations of @xmath56 h / mo .",
    "finally , we provided a microscopical description of the 1t@xmath1 raman spectrum attributing the j@xmath3 , j@xmath0 and j@xmath4 features to specifical vibrations .",
    "these features were experimentally detected in 1986 @xcite , but their interpretation and understanding was unknown .",
