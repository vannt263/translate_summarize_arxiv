    "the one dimensional aklt model that we will consider consists of a chain of @xmath11 spin-@xmath12 s in the bulk , and two spin-@xmath13 on the boundary .",
    "the location where the spins sit are called sites .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath14 the vector of spin-@xmath15 operators and by @xmath16 spin@xmath17 operators , where @xmath18 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath19 where the hamiltonian corresponding to the bulk is given by    @xmath20    and the sum runs over the lattice sites .",
    "the boundary terms @xmath21 describe interaction of a spin @xmath13 and spin @xmath15 .",
    "each term is a projector on a state with spin @xmath22 :    @xmath23    in order to construct the ground state @xmath24 of @xmath25 we can associate two spin @xmath13 variables at each lattice site and create the spin @xmath15 state symmetrizing them . to prevent the formation of spin @xmath26 , we antisymmetrize states between different neighbor lattice sites .",
    "doing this we are sure that this configuration is actually an eigenstate of the hamiltonian , with eigenvalue @xmath27 ( i.e. the projection of @xmath28 on the subspace of spin 2-states is zero ) . noting that the hamiltonian @xmath25 is positive definite , then we know that this is the ground state .",
    "we can associate a graph to this state , defining dots as spins @xmath13 , links as anti - symmetrization , and circles as symmetrization .",
    "the graph representation of the vbs ground state is then given by        it is possible to write down a compact expression for this vbs state using bosonic variables .",
    "following @xcite , we make use of the schwinger boson representation for @xmath29 algebra at each site @xmath30 , namely @xmath31 with @xmath32=\\pm s^\\pm_i \\delta_{ij } , \\quad [ s^+_i , s^{-}_j]=+2 s^z_i \\delta_{ij}$ ] , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are two sets of bosonic creation operators , with the usual commutation relations @xmath35=[b_i , b^\\dagger_j]=\\delta_{ij}$ ] , @xmath36=[b_i , b_j]=0 $ ] and correspondingly for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this two sets commute in each and every lattice site , i.e. @xmath39=[a_i^\\dagger , b_j]=0 $ ] . to have a finite dimensional representation of @xmath29 , it is necessary to impose one more condition on @xmath33 and @xmath34 , given by @xmath40 with @xmath41 the value of the spin at site @xmath30 ( in this paper we have @xmath42 for @xmath43 and 1/2 at @xmath44 ) . in this language",
    "the vbs ground state is given by @xcite    @xmath45    where @xmath46 .",
    "the state @xmath47 is defined by @xmath48 , and it s called the vacuum state for the set of operators @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath49 is defined similarly for the set @xmath34 . in @xcite",
    "the authors prove that this ground state is unique for the hamiltonian h , then we can construct the density matrix of the ( pure ) ground state @xmath50 this is a one dimensional projector on the @xmath51 ground state of the hamiltonian .",
    "in order to compute the partial transposed density matrix of the vbs system , we define three subsystems @xmath0 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath0 is a block of @xmath2 spins 1 and @xmath54 is it s complement ( see fig . [",
    "fig : blocks ] )                respectively .",
    "this states describe spins 1 in the bulk ( i.e at @xmath66 ) and spin 1/2 in the boundary . to recover the spin 1 at those boundaries sites , we introduce the following notation @xmath67 and @xmath68 , to have        the four states @xmath71 belong to the hilbert space of the block @xmath0 of length @xmath2 .",
    "they span the kernel of @xmath72 @xcite , but they are not orthogonal to each other .",
    "we make use of the classical variable method , introduced in @xcite ( see appendix [ appa ] ) , to prove      valid for @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) . the norm @xmath76 is defined as usual @xmath77 .",
    "all other combinations vanish .",
    "we can perform a rotation of this basis in order to make the overlap ( [ overlap ] ) vanish .",
    "the new basis is defined by        where @xmath80 .",
    "this four different eigenstates of the bulk hamiltonian corresponding to the block @xmath0 , can be labeled by the bell pair that is formed between the spins 1/2 at the boundary .",
    "the boundary operators @xmath81 which act on the subspace @xmath1 , also organize themselves in irreducible representations , with the only condition that adjacent boundary operators acting on @xmath0 and @xmath1 can not create a state of spin 2 , as required by the vbs ground state symmetry .",
    "we define the following operators for further simplicity ( here , sum over dummy variables @xmath82 and @xmath83 is assumed )        the operators @xmath89 keep explicit the symmetry between the operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 , remaining unchanged ( up to phase factors ) when we interchange the operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this operation corresponds to take the transpose of @xmath90 , so @xmath91 , for @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "as the set of operators @xmath89 acting on the outer edges of an state is just a linear combination of the states defined in ( [ firstbasis ] ) , the states of the form @xmath94 are a basis for the four dimensional space of degenerate ground states of the bulk hamiltonian ( [ aklt_bulk ] ) .",
    "we can define the state @xmath100 . in terms of this state",
    ", the density matrix ( [ density_matrix ] ) takes the form @xmath101 , and the eigenvector is clearly @xmath102 with eigenvalue 1 .",
    "this is natural because so far we have just taken another basis to represent @xmath103 , which was already a projector onto the vbs ground state .",
    "it s important to note that if we trace the @xmath1 block in expression ( [ density_matrix ] ) , we get the partial density matrix respect to the a subsystem @xmath104 . this expression was already found in @xcite .",
    "the von neumman or entanglement entropy is given by @xmath105 and scales with the length of the boundary as expected .",
    "the entanglement spectrum for @xmath104 is @xmath106 no degeneracy and @xmath107 with triple degeneracy ( @xmath108 ) @xcite .        where it is understood that all the operators @xmath89 are evaluated at the boundary sites @xmath110 and @xmath111 and @xmath112 . with this explicit form of @xmath3",
    ", we can compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues .                          in section [ n2systems ] , we computed the transposed density matrix of a system consisting of two blocks inside the vbs state , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , of length @xmath230 and @xmath231 respectively .",
    "the spins which do not belong to @xmath6 have been traced away . in the general case",
    "when the blocks are separated by @xmath2 sites we could prove that the negativity vanishes for @xmath387 , being the only nontrivial case when @xmath131 .",
    "in that case , the negativity in the asymptotic limit @xmath240 is given by      the decay in the thermodynamic limit is twice as fast compared to the usual decay of the spin correlations , a feature that is already seen in the case of the negativity of the pure system studied before .        in the of adjacent blocks , for any @xmath374 ,",
