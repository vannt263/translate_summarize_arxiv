    "* motivation . *",
    "the decomposition of tensors into a minimal sum of rank-1 terms , sometimes referred to as the _ canonical decomposition _ ( cand ) , has raised a great interest in several quite different branches of engineering @xcite as well as in mathematics @xcite .",
    "more precisely , if we take the example of tensors of order 4 to fix the ideas , the cand of a tensor @xmath4 is defined as : @xmath5 the minimal value of @xmath6 such that the equality holds is called the _ rank _ of tensor @xmath4 .    in applications ,",
    "these tensors are often corrupted by measurement or estimation noises , which can be modeled as additive random variables with continuous probability distribution .",
    "the consequence is that tensors to be decomposed are _",
    "generic_. a key question is then to know what is the rank of such tensors as a function of order and dimensions , and when they admit a _ finite number _ of cand . for real or complex _ symmetric _ tensors decomposed in the _ complex _ field , this question has been answered , and enters the framework of the _ waring problem _ @xcite .",
    "the theorem of alexander and hirschowitz ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) answers that the generic rank is always the expected one , with a finite list of exceptions .",
    "however , it has not yet received any response either for non symmetric tensors , or for decompositions in the real field .",
    "ten berge showed that real third order generic tensors can assume two typical ranks , @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "but he could not find generic tensors assuming more than two typical ranks .",
    "regarding general complex tensors , some partial results are contained in @xcite , while @xcite provides a complete answer for tensors of format @xmath8 .",
    "we point out also the recent preprint @xcite , where the related concept of signature is studied",
    ".    * contribution . * in order to exhibit more than two typical ranks , it seems necessary to consider tensors of order higher than 3 .",
    "the simplest case we can think of is that of real symmetric tensors of dimension 2 and order 4 or 5 . yet",
    ", such tensors are bijectively associated with homogeneous polynomials in two variables @xcite , namely binary quartics and quintics , respectively .",
    "the previous definition translates to binary forms as follows .",
    "the rank of a binary form @xmath9 of degree @xmath3 defined over the field @xmath10 is the minimum integer @xmath6 such that there is a decomposition @xmath11 where @xmath12 are linear forms and @xmath13 .",
    "note that the rank is called `` length '' in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath10 is the real field , coefficients @xmath14 can be imposed to belong to @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath10 is the complex field , one can impose @xmath16 for all coefficients . in the complex field ,",
    "the rank of a general binary form @xmath17 of odd degree @xmath18 is @xmath19 .",
    "the sylvester theorem asserts that the decomposition of such general form @xmath17 as a sum of @xmath19 powers of linear forms is unique ( up to a multiplicative factor for each @xmath14 ) , and gives also a way to determine it .",
    "the _ rank _ of a general binary form @xmath17 of even degree @xmath20 is @xmath19 , but in this case such decompositions form an infinite set , which can be identified with the projective line .",
    "it is interesting that no semicontinuity holds for the rank .",
    "indeed there are forms such that their rank is bigger than the general value and other such that the rank is lower than the general value .",
    "indeed it is well known ( see for example comas and seiguer @xcite ) that on the complex numbers the rank can attain all the values between @xmath21 and @xmath3 .",
    "define @xmath22 , the set of binary forms of rank exactly @xmath6 .",
    "on complex numbers , @xmath23 has a non empty interior only for the pairs @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "that is , for every @xmath3 , there is a unique @xmath6 such that @xmath23 is dense .",
    "the latter values of @xmath6 are called _ generic ranks _ in @xmath26 . on the real numbers we are intested in the pairs @xmath24 such that @xmath27 has non empty interior .",
    "if for a given value of @xmath3 there exist several values of @xmath6 , the latter are called _",
    "typical ranks_. in other words , if @xmath28 are typical , none of the sets @xmath29 is dense , but @xmath30 is .",
    "for @xmath31 the situation is well known and we recall it in the next section .",
    "our main results are the following , for @xmath32 .    * main theorem * +",
    "( i ) @xmath33 has non empty interior only for @xmath34 .",
    "more precisely , assume that @xmath17 has distinct roots , then    * ( i1 ) if @xmath17 has four real roots then the rank of @xmath17 is @xmath35 .",
    "* ( i2 ) if @xmath17 has zero or two real roots then the rank of @xmath17 is @xmath36 .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath37 has non empty interior only for @xmath38 .",
    "more precisely , assume that @xmath17 has distinct roots , then    * ( i1 ) if @xmath17 has five real roots then the rank of @xmath17 is @xmath39 .",
    "* ( i2 ) if @xmath17 has one or three real roots then the rank of @xmath17 is @xmath36 or @xmath35 , according to the sign of an invariant of degree @xmath40 defined in section @xmath35 , where we provide an algorithm and some pictures ) .",
    "very probably , @xmath41 has a non empty interior if and only if @xmath42 .",
    "we leave this as a conjecture to the readers ( proved here for @xmath43 ) , as the intriguing problem of the relations between @xmath41 and the loci where the number of real roots is fixed .",
    "we prove also ( see the prop .",
    "[ dreal ] ) that if a form of degree @xmath3 has the maximal number @xmath3 of real roots , then its rank attains the maximum possible value which is again @xmath3 .",
    "there is always an open subset where the general rank is the same as the complex one .",
    "in other words , for given order and dimension , the smallest typical rank in the real field coincides with the generic rank in the complex field ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "an elementary example illustrating the difference between real and complex rank is given by the equality @xmath44 in this case the complex rank is @xmath45 and the real rank is @xmath36 .",
    "let s begin with a known general statement .",
    "[ maxrank ] any binary real form of degree @xmath3 has real rank @xmath46 .    the points of the projective space @xmath47 correspond to forms @xmath48 , which have coordinates @xmath49 .",
    "the rational normal curve @xmath50 , corresponds to polynomials which are @xmath3-th powers of linear forms . from the expansion @xmath51",
    "we get that the curve @xmath50 can be parametrized by @xmath52 .",
    "pick @xmath53 general points on @xmath50 corresponding to @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "the linear span of @xmath17 and these points is a hyperplane , whose equation @xmath56 restricts to @xmath50 to the binary form @xmath57 of degree @xmath3 with the @xmath53 real roots @xmath58 ( because @xmath59 ) hence also the last root is real , corresponding to a last linear form @xmath60 .",
    "this means that @xmath17 is a projective linear combination of the the powers @xmath61 for @xmath62 , or equivalently , @xmath17 has rank @xmath46 .",
    "because of the bijection mentioned earlier , @xmath63 corresponds to a symmetric @xmath64 matrix , and its rank is the same as the rank of the associated matrix .",
    "hence @xmath17 has rank @xmath45 if and only if @xmath17 has distinct roots , both for @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "so @xmath67 has non empty interior only if @xmath68 .    for any field of characteristic zero ,",
    "the dual ring of differential operators @xmath69 $ ] acts on the polynomial ring @xmath70=\\oplus_{d\\ge 0 } sym^d({\\mathbb{k}}^2)=\\oplus_{d\\ge 0}r_d$ ] with the usual rules of differentiations .",
    "this action preserves the degrees , in the sense that we have the pairing @xmath71 which means that the homogeneous differential operators of degree @xmath72 takes homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath3 to homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath74 , we denote by @xmath75 its orthogonal ( apolar ) operator , such that @xmath76 .",
    "the main remark , which goes back to the xixth century , is that the form @xmath77 is killed by the operator @xmath78 .",

    "we may assume @xmath85 , so that its kernel has dimension @xmath86 .",
    "this holds on any field @xmath10 .",
    "in particular the general form of degree @xmath18 is killed by a unique operator of degree @xmath87 .",
    "this gives a proof of sylvester theorem over @xmath26 .",
    "the kernel of the hankel matrix of size @xmath88 is an operator @xmath89 of degree @xmath87 , and decomposing it over @xmath26 as @xmath90 gives the decomposition of @xmath17 as sum of @xmath87 @xmath3-th powers of the @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath17 is real , the kernel @xmath89 is real , but the decomposition is possible only if all the roots of @xmath89 ( thought as a polynomial ) are real .",
    "comon and mourrain explored further this situation @xcite . if it is not possible to find a kernel of degree @xmath87 such that all its roots are real , we consider operators of degree @xmath91 and we look for such an operator in the kernel such that all the roots are real . if this is not possible we go further , and so on .",
    "we use this technique by reproving the classically known criterion to determine the rank in the case @xmath92 . for @xmath93 , consider the discriminant @xmath94    [ d3 ] @xmath95 has non empty interior only for @xmath96 .",
    "precisely , let @xmath17 be a polynomial of third degree without multiple roots .",
