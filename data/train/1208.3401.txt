    "the number of doping electrons in the gap states are close to 2.0 independent of the size of the slab and type of termination . except for the extreme case of the @xmath4 slab , the second tio@xmath1 layer in the sro surface termination not only contributes maximally to the electron distribution but also accumulates a similar number of electrons as the 1st tio@xmath1 layer on the tio@xmath1 surface termination slabs , while the 2nd sro layer in the tio@xmath1 surface termination slabs has almost no doping electrons .",
