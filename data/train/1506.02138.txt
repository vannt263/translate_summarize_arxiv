    "the observed scalar particle in 2012 of mass @xmath6 gev @xcite , is consistent with the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson . in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , this motivates considering models of supersymmetry breaking in which the stop superpartner is heavy ( beyond the reach of the lhc ) or a model in which a large trilinear @xmath0 soft supersymmetry breaking parameter can be generated at low energies .",
    "the first option is disfavored by fine - tuning arguments while the second one allows for lighter stops @xmath2 tev and it is thus preferred by naturalness arguments .",
    "the solution advocated in this work is to resolve the previous issue by introducing an extra ( fifth ) dimension and taking advantage of the power low running @xcite to generate a sizable value of @xmath0 starting from a very small value .",
    "we define 5-dimensional ( 5d ) mssm , the higgs superfields and gauge superfields always live in the bulk . as consequence",
    "these fields will have kaluza - klein modes which contribute to the rges at @xmath7 and additional matter associated to five dimensional @xmath8 super yang - mills .",
    "different possibilities of localising the matter superfields can be studied .",
    "we shall consider the limiting case of superfields with sm matter fields restricted to the brane , and the rges for this scenario can be found in ref .",
    "therefore there will be no additional kaluza - klein contributions of these matter fields to the rges@xcite .",

    "@xcite ) , ultimately the universality of squark massses in gmsb means that even though the gaugino mediated limit @xcite might allow for light squarks ( and 5d rge evolution allows for a large @xmath0 and the observed higgs mass ) , the collider bounds on first and second generation squarks @xcite , in the supra - tev range would apply also to the @xmath9 generation squarks , i.e. the stops , which as discussed before , is both phenomenologically less interesting and unnatural . therefore we wish for some other description of supersymmetry breaking that may allow for stops to be lighter than their first and second generation counterparts , such as in refs . @xcite . in this work",
    "we will therefore be unspecific about the precise details of how supersymmetry is broken and as a result also our conclusions will apply quite generally .",
    "we do however make some minimal specifications :    * we take as inputs the yukawa and gauge couplings at the susy scale , @xmath10 tev .",
    "* we will assume supersymmetry breaking occurs at the unification scale , which is found by finding the scale at which @xmath11 , which is lowered compared to the 4d mssm , by the effects of the compactification .",
    "* we specify the value of the gluino mass , @xmath12 at @xmath10 tev . *",
    "we take the trilinear soft breaking terms , @xmath13 , to vanish at the unification scale .",
    "we solved the combined set of differential equations numerically by using the above conditions , taking the `` third family '' approximation in which we only evolve third generation rges .",
    "this approximation is quite standard and is due to the relative smallness of the other yukawa couplings ( at least one order of magnitude ) compared to those of the third generation and as a result the other a - term values are also very small .",
    "we further specified some parameters such as @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the value of the sfermion masses ( @xmath2 tev ) so as to allow for the rges to be solved , but these do not affect the overall result .",

    "realising such a high @xmath0 is usually difficult ( in supergravity , mgmsb , ... ) @xcite but it is shown here concretely that 5d mssm with compactification scale around 10-@xmath1 tev can achieve large @xmath0 amounts at low scale ( starting from @xmath23 ) , thanks to the power law running and simultaneously with an approximate unification of the gauge couplings , the precision of this gauge unification is illustrated quantitatively ( at one - loop ) for various values of the compactification scale as pictured in fig .",
