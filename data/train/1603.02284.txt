    "star - formation rates ( sfrs ) are among the most fundamental measurements for constraining the physics of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the past decade has seen a multitude of studies that trace sfrs out to high redshift ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and examined their correlation with other galaxy properties , such as stellar masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ and _ herschel space observatory _ opened a new window into measuring bolometric sfrs by allowing us to directly correct the widely - used sfrs(uv ) for dust - obscured star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . however , despite their common use , the uv+ir sfrs have several disadvantages : first , due to the limited spatial resolution and sensitivity of _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ , most of the individual distant galaxies are not detectable in ir images , and second , the empirical templates used to convert the mid - ir ( restframe 8@xmath3 m ) fluxes to total ir luminosities result in systematic biases @xcite .",
    "hydrogen balmer emission lines are considered to be another gold standard for tracing robust sfrs in local galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) .",
    "until recently , high - redshift studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) only detected h@xmath2 with no ( or very limited ) h@xmath7 measurements , which are required for accurate dust corrections .",
    "however , with the new generation of multi - object near - ir ( nir ) spectrographs , both h@xmath2 and h@xmath7 are now detectable for normal star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 @xcite .    while dust - corrected sfrs(h@xmath2 ) using balmer decrements ( hereafter , sfrs(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) )",
    "are commonly used at low redshift , we still need to investigate how well balmer lines trace sfr at high redshifts , as galaxies were more star - forming at @xmath0 , the peak of the sfr density evolution @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been argued that balmer lines may miss optically thick star - forming regions at these high redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in order to investigate this possible bias , one needs to compare the sfrs(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) with independently measured uv - to - far - ir ( uv - to - fir ) sfrs for star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "fortunately , such dusty systems are among the luminous tail of the galaxy distribution within reach of _ herschel_.    in this paper , we use the unique dataset of the mosfire deep evolution field ( mosdef ) survey @xcite in combination with _ herschel _ and",
    "_ spitzer _ data , to investigate how well sfrs(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) agree with uv - to - fir sfrs at @xmath0 . for the latter , we use the flexible stellar population synthesis ( fsps ) models @xcite , which utilize energy balance to fit the stellar and dust emission simultaneously @xcite . throughout this paper",
    ", we assumed a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) , and h@xmath9 .",
    "the mosdef survey is a multi - year project that uses the mosfire spectrometer on the keck  i telescope to study the stellar and gaseous content of @xmath10 galaxies and agns at @xmath11 .",
    "the survey covers the candels fields , for which extensive deep multi - wavelength data are available @xcite . for details of the survey strategy ,",
    "observations , data reduction , and sample characteristics see @xcite .",
    "the current study is based on data from the first two years of the mosdef survey .",
    "we selected a sample of mosdef galaxies based on their balmer emission and ir luminosities .",
    "the h@xmath2 and h@xmath7 luminosities were estimated by fitting gaussian functions to the line profiles .",
    "flux uncertainties were derived using monte carlo simulations . the spectra were flux calibrated by comparing the spectrum of a slit star with the total photometric flux @xcite in the same filter . to account for the fact that galaxies are resolved ,",
    "an additional slit - loss correction was applied using the _ hst _ profiles for each galaxy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the uncertainties on the total slit - loss corrected fluxes were 16% and 20% for h@xmath2 and h@xmath7 , respectively @xcite .",
    "h@xmath2 and h@xmath7 fluxes were corrected for underlying balmer absorption as determined from uv - to - nir sed modeling @xcite . the h@xmath2 luminosity was converted to sfr using the @xcite relation and was corrected for dust attenuation using the balmer decrement ( h@xmath2/h@xmath7 ) , assuming the @xcite galactic extinction curve . for those galaxies with undetected h@xmath7 , we used @xmath1 upper - limits on the h@xmath7 fluxes that translate to lower - limits on h@xmath2/h@xmath7 and thus lower - limits on dust - corrected sfr(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) .",
    "for the ir measurements we used data from _ spitzer_/mips and _ herschel_/pacs and spire in the cosmos ( pi : m.  dickinson ) , goods - n , and goods - s fields @xcite .",
    "we measured ir fluxes simultaneously using scaled point - spread functions ( psfs ) @xcite , which enable us to more robustly recover fluxes of confused objects . in brief , for each image we used a prior list of objects from higher resolution images to determine the location of all sources in the field .",
    "for the mips images we used @xmath1 irac sources ; for the pacs images we used @xmath1 mips sources ; and for the spire images we used the pacs sources detected at @xmath1 ( for the 250 and 350@xmath3 m bands ) and @xmath12 ( for the 500@xmath3 m band ) . in order to perform the photometry , a subimage centered on each target was constructed and the psf was fitted simultaneously to all the objects in the subimage ( including the target ) and one random background position , which was chosen to be at least 1 fwhm away from any source .",
    "we repeated this procedure for 20 random background positions .",
    "the standard deviation of the background fluxes was adopted as the flux uncertainty .",
    "the accuracy of our photometry was tested by simulating 500 sources with a large range of fluxes that were added to the original images .",
    "the simulated fluxes were recovered successfully with a given scatter that , as expected , decreased with increasing flux .",
    "based on this scatter , we estimated a correction factor to be applied to the background - estimated errors for each individual source .",
    "these corrections ranged from a factor of @xmath13 , depending on the filter .",
    "we selected galaxies whose ir photometry was not significantly affected by nearby sources and had robust detections ( signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath14 ) in h@xmath2 , mips 24@xmath3 m , and at least one pacs filter ( 100 or 160@xmath3 m ) .",
    "the final sample consists of 13 galaxies with both h@xmath2 and h@xmath7 detections and 4 h@xmath7-undetected galaxies .",
    "only three of these galaxies were detected in the spire filters .",
    "we did not include objects that were classified as agns based on their x - ray emission , irac colors , or optical emission lines ( with the criterion of [ nii]/h@xmath2@xmath15 , @xcite ) .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : ms ] , most of our galaxies lie above the median sfr-@xmath16 relation by @xcite with @xmath17 .",
    "in this section we derive total sfrs by comparing the panchromatic seds - composed of the uv - to - irac photometry from 3d - hst @xcite combined with ir photometry ( previous section ) - with stellar population models .",
    "we generated composite stellar populations using the fsps code ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* v2.5 ) , assuming a chabrier imf and solar metallicity . for the star - formation history ( sfh )",
    "we assumed a delayed - tau model of the form @xmath18 , in which @xmath19 is the age of the galaxy and @xmath20 is the e - folding time .",
    "@xmath20 was allowed to vary from @xmath21myr in steps of 0.2dex .",
    "we set a 50myr lower limit on age corresponding to the typical dynamical timescale at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we adopted a @xcite attenuation curve , in which the dust optical depth at 5500  was allowed to vary from 0.0 to 4.0 in steps of 0.1 .",
    "the dust emission in the fsps code follows the @xcite ( dl07 ) models . in these dust models ,",
    "the radiation field strength , @xmath22 , is described by a delta function at @xmath23 ( the radiation intensity to which the dust in the diffuse ism is exposed ) and a power - law component for the radiation from dust heated by more intense starlight ( ob associations ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 represents the fraction of dust that is heated by the intense starlight .",
    "as was suggested in dl07 , we allowed @xmath23 to vary between 0.1 to 25.0 in 10 logarithmic steps , the @xmath24 grid was set to @xmath25 $ ] , and we explored pah fractions of @xmath26% .",
    "we shifted the models to the spectroscopic redshift of each galaxy , applied the @xcite prescription to correct the seds for the intergalactic medium absorption , and then , adopting a @xmath27 minimization method ( using the original photometric errors ) , fit the models to the uv - to - fir photometry .",
    "the optical photometry was corrected for contamination by bright emission lines ( h@xmath2 , [ oiii ] , [ oii ] , etc . ) as measured from the mosdef spectra @xcite .",
    "we perturbed the photometry according to the measurement uncertainties for 100 realizations and the dispersion in each best - fit parameter was adopted as the associated uncertainty .",
    "the best - fit models of the h@xmath2+h@xmath7-detected candidates are displayed in figures  [ fig : seds1 ] and [ fig : seds2 ] .",
    "we would have found similar sfrs if instead we modeled the ir emission by a single blackbody sed . in order to assure that our best - fit models are not skewed by the smaller 24@xmath3 m errors compared to the pacs errors , we tested the sed fitting with equal weighting for the 24 , 100 , and 160@xmath3 m fluxes .",
    "for all but two galaxies ( galaxies 1 and 13 ) , the corresponding sfrs and ir luminosities were within @xmath28 uncertainty of the original sfr and l(ir ) values .",
    "in this section we investigate how the sfrs derived from different diagnostics compare with each other . fitting the stellar and dust seds simultaneously using energy balance",
    "is thought to give a robust estimate of the total sfr .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfrs](a ) shows that sfrs(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) are in good agreement with the full sed - inferred sfrs ( sfr@xmath29 ) .",
    "the tightness of the correlation between @xmath30(sfr(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) ) and @xmath30(sfr@xmath29)(sfr(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) ) and @xmath30(sfr@xmath29 ) relation has 0.17dex scatter about the unity line and spearman @xmath31 with @xmath32 from a null correlation . ] , its consistency with the unity line , and the absence of any systematic correlation as a function of @xmath16 ( see the inset plot  [ fig : sfrs](a ) ) , imply that the dust - corrected l(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) is an unbiased tracer of the total sfr for @xmath0 star - forming galaxies with sfrs up to @xmath33 .",
    "there is a systematic uncertainty associated with our choice of the attenuation curve . assuming the calzetti curve instead of the cardelli curve to correct the observed h@xmath2 predicts higher sfrs by an average factor of 1.2 ( as high as 1.4 for the galaxy with the highest sfr ; diamonds in figure  [ fig : sfrs]a ) .",
    "the larger dust correction is expected as the calzetti curve has a higher normalization at 6563 .",
    "we adopted the cardelli curve as it was derived based on the line - of - sight measurements of hii regions , and therefore preferable for the extinction correction of nebular lines .",
    "given that the majority of the @xmath0 galaxies are not detected with _",
    "herschel _ , it is important to know how well we can recover the total sfr with only 24@xmath3 m data .",
    "we fit the fsps models to the uv - to-24@xmath3 m data and set the dust emission parameters to the default values ( pah fraction = 3.5% , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : sfrs](b ) .",
    "there is a larger ( 0.22dex ) scatter between sfr@xmath36 and sfr(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) , and sfr@xmath36 underestimates sfr(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) for the highest star - forming galaxies in our sample .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sfrs ] , panels c and d , we estimated the bolometric sfr by adding unobscured sfr(uv ) to obscured sfr(ir ) .",
    "the sfr(uv ) is derived from luminosity at 1600  by fitting a power - law function of the form @xmath37 to the photometry at rest wavelengths @xmath38 , and using the @xcite conversion between l(uv ) and sfr . in order to estimate the total l(ir ) , we fit the locally calibrated @xcite templates ( hereafter , ce01 ) to the 24 , 100 , and 160@xmath3 m fluxes in figure  [ fig : sfrs](c ) , and in figure  [ fig : sfrs](d ) we converted the 24@xmath3 m to total l(ir ) using the luminosity - independent conversions of @xcite ( hereafter , w08 ) .",
    "the scatter between both the sfr(ir ) indicators and sfr(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) is larger than the scatter in figure  [ fig : sfrs](a ) by @xmath39dex .",
    "incorporating the spire photometry in the ce01 fitting does not change the results , as most of our galaxies are undetected in the spire bands .",
    "whether the increased scatter is due to the limited parameter space of the ir templates or because of ignoring energy balance is an open question that can not be addressed with the limited data used in this study .",
    "moreover , we tested the @xcite empirically - derived coefficients to infer total sfrs by combining observed h@xmath2 and ir luminosities .",
    "the combined sfrs were systematically lower than our sfr(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) and sfr@xmath40 by @xmath39dex .",
    "the @xcite sample of nearby galaxies have a higher contribution of evolved populations of stars heating the dust , and therefore , their scaling factor underestimates the total sfr for our star - forming galaxies .",
    "our sample contains 4 galaxies without h@xmath7 detections , for which we determined @xmath1 lower limits on the sfr(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) .",
    "the low sfr@xmath29 of the h@xmath7-undetected galaxies compared to the rest of the sample indicates that we are not biased against galaxies in which h@xmath7 is suppressed by dust attenuation . the h@xmath7 line in all four galaxies happened to fall close to a bright skyline , which likely explains their low s / n in h@xmath7 .    , based on uv - to - nir sed ) to the measured ( l(ir)@xmath41 ) ir luminosities as a function of rest - frame @xmath42 color .",
    "the good agreement between the two estimated ir luminosities suggests that there is not a dominant obscured stellar population that is missing from the uv - to - nir sed .",
    "galaxies with undetected h@xmath7 are shown with crosses .",
    "numbers correspond to the seds in figures  [ fig : seds1],[fig : seds2 ] . ]",
    "one concern regarding the use of energy - balance sed modeling is that for a galaxy with two distinct stellar populations , with one enshrouded by dust , and hence , bright in ir , and the other population less dusty and brighter in uv , the ir and uv - to - nir parts of the spectrum will be decoupled . for such cases ,",
    "an energy - balance method would underestimate the true sfr and l(ir ) . to address this issue , we calculated l(ir ) based on the the uv - to - nir sed and compared it to the observed @xmath43 m photometry ( using the same stellar population models and fitting assumptions as for the full modeling , section  [ sec : fullsed ] ) .",
    "we used the estimated total extinction value at 1600  ( @xmath44 ) and unobscured sfr(uv ) measured from the luminosity at 1600   , to calculate the _ obscured _ sfr : @xmath45    using the @xcite relation , we converted the obscured sfr to total l(ir ) at @xmath4 m and compared it to the l(ir ) based on our best - fit full sed model , integrated from 8 to 1000@xmath3 m .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : lir ] .",
    "for all galaxies in our sample , the uv - to - nir sed - derived l(ir ) is within a factor of @xmath46 of the integrated full sed l(ir ) , suggesting that there is not a dominant stellar population that is completely obscured and thus missed from the uv - to - nir sed .",
    "the results of the uv - to - nir sed - inferred ir luminosities are sensitive to the assumed sfh and the sed - predicted ages .",
    "if instead of a delayed - tau sfh we use a rising sfh of the form @xmath47 , the best - fit sed model predicts a high amount of dust obscuration for our most massive galaxies . because of the high dust obscuration inferred from the stellar sed , l(ir ) and sfr",
    "are overpredicted by a factor of @xmath48 . additionally , as found in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , without a minimum age of 50myr the best - fit uv - to - nir seds result in unrealistically young ages and high dust values for a subset of our galaxies .",
    "the l(ir ) comparison test is similar to comparing the uv - to - nir and full sed sfrs . with a physically reasonable age range and the delayed - tau sfhs ,",
    "the uv - to - nir sed and full sed sfrs are in good agreement ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 away from a zero correlation ) .",
    "both tests illustrate that the sfr derived from the stellar emission alone is not biased compared to the uv - to - fir sed - based sfr for @xmath0 galaxies with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "uv - inferred sfrs are susceptible to missing or underestimating the sfr of galaxies for which the bulk of the star formation is obscured and the uv slope is decoupled from the total obscuration @xcite .",
    "although for a given column of dust h@xmath2 and h@xmath7 are less attenuated than the uv , hii regions may also be optically thick at these wavelengths .",
    "we show in this paper that for galaxies with @xmath53yr@xmath54 the h@xmath2 luminosity , once properly corrected for dust attenuation using the balmer decrement , do not underestimate the sfr .",
    "the same result holds for uv - to - nir sed inferred sfrs , assuming delayed - tau sfhs .",
    "this conclusion does not necessarily hold at higher sfrs ( i.e. , submillimeter galaxies ) owing to highly obscured nebular and/or stellar regions .",
    "such ir - luminous galaxies are likely missed in our study due to their low number density or highly obscured emission lines . to test the latter",
    ", we checked the mosdef target sample for galaxies with ir detections and undetected h@xmath2 lines , and found two . due to uncertain redshifts and noisy spectra",
    "we did not include them in this study . however , deeper and/or wider wavelength range spectra are needed to confirm these systems .",
    "there are additional caveats to our analysis which need to be explored in more detail in future studies .",
    "first , both the sfr(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) and the sfr@xmath29 suffer from systematic uncertainties in the assumed imf , metallicity , and sfh .",
    "second , the sfr(h@xmath2,h@xmath7 ) is affected by the choice of the assumed dust attenuation curve ( section  [ sec : sfrs ] ) , and the sfr@xmath29 by the assumed dust emission models .",
