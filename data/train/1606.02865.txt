    "a very good example is given by co - doped bafe@xmath5as@xmath5 , one of the most studied fe - based superconductors ( fbs ) , in which the neutron resonance peak was observed@xcite . note that this resonance peak is hardly elucidated by electron - phonon interaction .",
    "typically , the parent compound of fe - based superconductor ( fbs ) shows a spin - density wave ( sdw ) phase at low temperatures .",
    "this magnetic instability is linked to the fermi surface ( fs ) nesting between hole - like pockets centered at the @xmath6-point and electron - like pockets at m - points in the brillouin zone@xcite . upon carrier doping ,",
    "the nesting condition is deteriorated and the superconductivity appears at a given doping level .",
    "the emergence of superconductivity in the vicinity of sdw immediately pushed the idea of strong spin fluctuations providing the main glue for cooper pairing in fbs .",
    "external pressure@xcite , chemical pressure@xcite , and strain in thin films@xcite may change the nesting conditions similarly to carrier doping . for the latter case ,",
    "tensile or compressive in - plane strain with biaxial and uniaxial components is induced by the lattice and/or thermal expansion mismatch between film and substrate .",
    "therefore , tensile or compressive in - plane strain may act as control parameter for the phase diagram by selecting a specific substrate .    here , we report a systematic study of ba(fe@xmath3co@xmath4)@xmath5as@xmath5 epitaxial thin films grown on mgo(001 ) and caf@xmath5(001 ) single crystalline substrates by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) .",

    "the resultant phase diagrams show that the nel temperature ( @xmath7 ) and the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath8 ) at a given co doping level depend strongly on the direction of in - plane strain .",

    "@xmath7 at zero doping is reduced and @xmath8 at optimal doping level is almost unchanged , and the whole phase diagram is shifted to lower doping level .",

    "the measured in - plane mr curves for both films clearly follow an almost perfect sinusoidal angle dependence without phase shift .",
    "if the oscillation were defined by the nematic domains oriented by the applied field as in the case of single crystals@xcite , the mr signal for ba-122/mgo should be shifted by 45@xmath32 with respect to the one for ba-122/caf@xmath5 .",
    "additionally , the amplitude of mr signals for both films are quite small compared to those of single crystals .",
    "this indicates that the substrate completely blocks the rotation of the nematic / magnetic domains .",

    "first of all , our local ( spin ) density approximation ( l(s)da ) calculation shows that the strain and the co doping affect mainly the hole fs pockets located at the zone center , whereas the electron pockets at the zone corners are nearly unchanged .",
    "these results are consistent with the arpes measurements for doped and undoped ba-122 single crystals reported recently@xcite .",
    "additionally , it was observed that an l(s)da and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) calculation gives a reasonable prediction of the effect of the co doping on the band structure@xcite .",
    "this observation strengthens our theoretical approach .    analyzing the changes of the hole fs pockets",
    ", we found that @xmath7 correlates well with the value of the @xmath49 dispersion of the fe @xmath50 @xmath51 orbitals on the hole fs pockets .",
    "as can be seen in fig.[fig : figure6 ] , the dispersion along @xmath49 of the undoped ba-122 film on mgo increases compared to that of the undoped bulk sample ( i.e. , relaxed ) due to tensile strain .",
    "@xmath7 of the former is lower than that of the latter , as shown in fig.[fig : figure3]a .",
    "simultaneously , the shape of the corresponding fs sheets is getting more three - dimensional .",
    "the same trend is observed for different co doping but with fixed strain state .",
    "in contrast , compressive strain alone ( i.e. , ba-122/caf@xmath5 with fixed co doping ) reduces the @xmath49 dispersion of the fe @xmath50 @xmath51 orbitals , which leads to the enhancement of @xmath7 .",
    "the observed three - dimensional effects of the fs are responsible for the suppression of the fs nesting conditions found by the arpes study@xcite .",
    "one can also see from figs.[fig : figure3]a and [ fig : figure3]b that the degree of shift in the superconducting dome along the doping axis correlates well with @xmath7 ; lower / higher @xmath7 pushes the sc dome towards the underdoped / overdoped region .",
    "such a tendency may be understood if cooper pairing and magnetic ordering is controlled by a common parameter .",
    "the result of the band structure calculation is insufficient for the interpretation of the observed behavior shown in fig.[fig : figure5]b .",
    "the scaling indicates that the value of the effective carrier number @xmath43 at the phase transition is not only related to the electronic structure but also strongly affected by critical fluctuations which are not included in the band structure calculations . as was shown by kontani @xmath52@xmath53 .",
    ", @xmath41 scales with the antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlation length ( @xmath54 ) in the case of strong af spin fluctuations@xcite .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath41 should approach zero at the phase transition .",
    "however , @xmath43 tends to a finite value @xmath55 carriers / fe ( excluding films with zero doping level ) at the magnetic transition as can be seen in fig.[fig : figure5]b .",
    "this seeming contradiction may be explained by considering the multiband nature of the fs .",
    "the hall coefficient is defined as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the full conductivities summed up over all bands .",
    "therefore , the hall number is given by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the conductivity of a hole ( h ) or an electron ( e ) band , @xmath61 or @xmath62 is the summation index running over different hole or electron bands , respectively , and @xmath63 is the corresponding carrier density@xcite .",
    "hence , as in the case of resistivity@xcite , the bands with the largest conductivities contribute most to the hall number . at the phase transition ,",
    "the conductivities of the interacting bands or part of the bands tend to zero due to strong scattering of their quasi - particles on the critical fluctuations .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 is simply determined by those parts of the fs which are less sensitive to critical fluctuations .",
    "this explains why the magnetic transition occurs at a finite @xmath41 value .",
    "good scaling for @xmath8 is observed for each side of the superconducting dome , since those regions are far from the magnetic transition lines . in this case , the value of @xmath42 is sensitive to the distance to the sdw line .",
    "therefore , the scaling for @xmath8 can be interpreted by the indication of a strong interplay between @xmath8 and the magnetic fluctuations slightly above @xmath8 , which are sensitive to the carrier doping and strain as well .",
    "a possible disorder effect on both @xmath8 and @xmath7 can not be separated from the spin fluctuation effect , since impurity scattering is also included in @xmath41 .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that strain essentially affects the phase diagram of the generic system ba(fe@xmath3co@xmath4)@xmath5as@xmath5 .",
    "the biaxial in - plane strain is responsible for a nearly rigid shift of the whole phase diagram including the magnetic and superconducting regions along the electron doping .",
