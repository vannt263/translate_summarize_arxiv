    "this presentation is based on work done in collaboration with bert schellekens , from the institute of subatomic physics nikhef ( amsterdam ) , together with edcel salumbides and wim ubachs , from the vrije universiteit of amsterdam . in the present study ,",
    "accurate results from precision molecular spectroscopy are exploited to put constraints on some higher - dimensional theories .",
    "the idea is that effects of new physics could manifest themselves as minute shifts in the quantum level structures of atoms and molecules . to detect such phenomena ,",
    "spectroscopic experiments must be performed at extreme precision , where key ingredients are ultra - stable lasers and laser metrology techniques , and comparisons must be made on systems for which very accurate first - principles calculations can be performed .    in recent years",
    "great progress has been made on the calculation of level energies in the neutral hydrogenic molecules ( h@xmath0 , hd and d@xmath0 ) and their ions ( h@xmath1 , hd@xmath2 and d@xmath1 ) .",
    "the results from the variety of experimental precision measurements on both the ionic and neutral hydrogenic molecules are in perfect agreement with the qed - calculations , within combined uncertainty limits from theory and experiment .",
    "this agreement between experiment and first - principles calculations on the level energies of hydrogenic molecules can be used to constrain the parameters associated with physics beyond the standard model , such as possible fifth forces between nucleons or the existence of extra space dimensions .",
    "since weak , strong and ( newtonian ) gravitational forces have negligible contributions to the molecular quantum level structure , electromagnetism is the sole force acting between the charged particles within light molecules .",
    "this makes it possible to derive bounds on possible fifth forces and extra dimensions from molecular precision experiments compared with qed - calculations  @xcite .",
    "although in the framework of string theory extra space dimensions were found to be necessary from the very begining in the middle seventies of last century , it took much longer to appreciate the beauty and usefulness of extra dimensions in ordinary quantum field theory . only in the late nineties ,",
    "after the seminal works of antoniadis , arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali ( add model )  @xcite on one side , and randall and sundrum ( rs - i and rs - ii models )  @xcite on the other , the particle physics community started considering extra dimensions as a real scientific possibility deserving further investigation .",
    "the mathematical formalisms of these models can be applied to molecular physics test bodies , from which constraints on the compactification scales can be derived for the add scenario , whereas constraints on the brane separation and bulk curvature can be derived for the rs - i and rs - ii scenarios .",
    "in the model put forward in 1998 by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali  @xcite ( plus antoniadis  @xcite in its implementation in string theory ) our observable universe consists of a 3-brane embedded in a higher - dimensional cosmos . there are @xmath3 extra space dimensions where only gravity can escape as the particles and interactions of the standard model remain confined in the ordinary 3-d space ( up to a small , negligible penetration inside the bulk ) .",
    "the extra dimensions are flat and compactified with the same radius @xmath4 , just for simplicity . therefore the extradimensional space is an @xmath3-dimensional torus where gravitation propagates rendering the observed gravitational strength much weaker as the flux lines dilute into the higher - dimensional volume . moreover , the propagation of gravity across the extradimensional space results in a modification of newton s law .",
    "the exact add gravitational potential reads  @xcite :    @xmath5    it has the contribution from the usual massless gravitons plus a tower of yukawa potentials mediated by all the massive modes : the kaluza - klein higher - dimensional gravitons , with momenta in the extra dimensions quantized in units of @xmath6 , and therefore with mass splittings of @xmath6 from our 3-d space perspective ( from the higher - dimensional perspective they are massless ) .",
    "for distances much larger than the compactification length range , @xmath7 , the newtonian potential is recovered :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the planck mass ( @xmath10 tev ) . for distances of the same size or shorter than the compactification length range , @xmath11 , the add potential takes the simple form :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the fundamental mass in the ( 4+@xmath3)-dimensional spacetime .",
    "observe that this expression for the gravitational potential can be interpreted in the context of the gauss law , without the need to invoke quantization of gravity .",
    "the planck mass @xmath9 is then related to the fundamental higher - dimensional mass @xmath13 via : @xmath14 thus the fundamental mass @xmath13 may still be small and @xmath9 becomes large due to the compactified volume of extra dimensions .",
    "arkani - hamed _ et al .",
    "_ proposed that @xmath13 equals the electroweak scale @xmath15 in order to solve the hierarchy problem , explaining in this manner the desert between the electroweak scale of 1 tev and the planck scale of @xmath10 tev . in the present study , since it is not our intention to solve the hierarchy problem , we leave @xmath13 as a free parameter , together with @xmath4 and @xmath3 , and we attempt to constrain these parameters from molecular physics experiments .",
    "the gravitational potential has an effect on the level energy of a molecular quantum state with wave function @xmath16 , written as an expectation value  @xcite : @xmath17 \\label{integrals}\\ ] ]    @xmath16 represents the probability that the internuclear separation is @xmath18 , the vibrational coordinate that probes the forces between the nucleons .",
    "the first integral represents the ordinary gravitational attraction , which for protons is @xmath19 times weaker than the electrostatic repulsion , and can therefore be neglected .",
    "the second integral represents the effect of modified gravity and is evaluated using accurate wave functions for the molecules .",
    "the wave functions of the h@xmath0 ground electronic state for @xmath20 and vibrational levels @xmath21 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ wavefunctions ] as obtained from _ ab initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite . in practice",
    ", the integration is performed up to @xmath22   since the wave function amplitude is negligible beyond that .",
    "in addition , at distances @xmath23   the wave function amplitude becomes negligible so that the second integral in eq .",
    "( [ integrals ] ) converges without additional assumptions .    for spectroscopic transitions between quantum states @xmath24 and @xmath25 in molecules , the expectation value for a higher - dimensional gravity contribution is given by a differential effect : @xmath26 \\label{add - trans}\\ ] ] here the add - expectation value",
    "is written explicitly as a function of the two relevant parameters : the number @xmath3 of extra space dimensions and the compactification scale @xmath4 . obviously , measurements on the dissociation limit of molecules , where @xmath24 is the lowest energy bound state and @xmath25 is the non - interacting two - atom limit at @xmath27 , are the most sensitive probes as the diference between @xmath24 and @xmath25 is larger .",
    "let us now consider the randall - sundrum scenarios , rs - i  @xcite and rs - ii  @xcite , presented by the authors in 1999 .",
    "they consist of two parallel 3-branes separated by a distance @xmath28 along one extra dimension @xmath29 .",
    "the branes have opposite tension @xmath30 ( vacuum energy ) and the bulk has a negative cosmological constant . according to general relativity , where all types of energy are gravity sources , the branes and the bulk produce gravitational fields , giving rise to the ads metric : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the warp factor and @xmath33 is the bulk curvature .",
    "the strength of gravity is highest on the positive @xmath34 tension brane and falls off along the extra dimension .    in analogy with the add model , in the rs models the particles and interactions of the standard model",
    "are confined in one 3-brane , that we denote the sm - brane , whereas gravity propagates everywhere .",
    "observe that the warped metric crucially differentiates the rs models from the add model with a flat metric where @xmath35 .",
    "the modified gravitational potential between two masses separated a distance @xmath18 in the sm - brane can be expressed as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the rs - i or rs - ii correction to the newtonian potential .    in the rs - i scenario",
    "the sm - brane is the negative @xmath38 tension brane .",
    "the authors did not present any gravitational potential for this model , however , and it was callin  @xcite , in 2004 , who presented its computation . for short distances , @xmath39 , he obtained : @xmath40 where one can distinguish two regimes , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , with the result at leading orders : @xmath43 the potential for long distances , @xmath44 , does not apply for the scales probed by molecules ( it gives inconsistent results ) and we do not consider it further .    in the rs - ii scenario the sm - brane is the positive @xmath34 tension brane .",
    "the @xmath38 tension brane can be set to infinity , @xmath45 , as the massless gravitons are localized very close to the @xmath34 brane , their wave function decreasing drastically along the extra dimension @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , in the rs - ii scenario the extra dimension needs not be compactified .",
    "the authors derived a potential with the long distance limit that has been applied to astrophysics ( see for example  @xcite ) . for short distances , @xmath39 ,",

    "this limit together with @xmath39 seems to indicate a smooth transition from rs - i to rs - ii for small bulk curvature @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as the brane separation @xmath28 is increased to infinity  @xcite .    from the rs corrections to the newtonian potential the expectation values of the leading - order shifts of transitions in molecules , for short distances @xmath39 , are therefore : @xmath50 , \\label{rs - trans - short}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 for the rs - i scenario and @xmath52 for the rs - ii scenario . using these expressions",
    ", we derive bounds on the brane separation @xmath28 and the bulk curvature @xmath33 from molecular spectroscopy data .",
    "the rs - ii scenario with a single brane can be generalized to @xmath3 extra dimensions provided that the mixing effects of the warp factors for each extra dimension are small compared with the leading order terms . in this case",
    "the resulting correction to the newtonian potential is , to a good approximation , the product of the leading corrections of each extra dimension . for @xmath3 extra dimensions , if the bulk curvatures have the same value @xmath33 , the rs - ii correction is then @xmath53 , where we use @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ rsii_potential_short ] ) .",
    "in the previous sections , the expectation value for a higher - dimensional gravity contribution to a transition frequency in a molecule was presented for both add and rs approaches to higher dimensions .",
    "this expectation value is interpreted as a contribution to the binding energy of molecules in certain quantum states . however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , analysis of recent experiments with hydrogen neutral molecules and their ions , together with their stable isotopomers containing deuterons , showed that qed computations are in very good agreement with observations for these molecular systems .",
    "consequently , one can derive constraints on the parameters underlying the higher - dimensional theories : the compactification scale @xmath4 depending on the number of extra dimensions @xmath3 , for the add scenario , and the bulk curvature @xmath33 or brane separation @xmath28 for the rs scenarios .",
    "for that purpose one can use the combined uncertainty @xmath55 for molecular systems , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are uncertainties of theory and experiment : @xmath58    in the add scenario the constraining relation @xmath59 translates on constraints on the compactification scale @xmath4 , depending on @xmath3 , via :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the difference in expectation values over the wave function densities in the molecule : @xmath62\\ ] ]    as shown in fig .",

    "consequently , the fundamental vibrational transition in the hydrogen molecule ( @xmath63 ) probes only a differential effect .",

    "however for a comparison of dissociation limits , it is no longer a small difference along the internuclear coordinate axis that is probed , but the difference between the molecular scale of 1    and infinite atomic separation .",

    "in addition , unlike for molecules , in the treatment of atoms some assumptions had to be made on the wave function density at @xmath93 , typical for the @xmath94-states involved , causing problems in calculating the second integral of eq .",

    "in contrast to qed calculations , the most accurate lattice - qcd calculation of light hadron masses only achieves relative accuracies in the order of a few percent .    in high - energy particle collisions ,",
    "higher - dimensional massive gravitons may be produced that could escape into the bulk , leading to events with missing energy in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime  @xcite .",

    "also for @xmath100 , the bounds derived from the lhc are more stringent than those from molecules .",
    "however , additional assumptions beyond the add potential in eq .",
    "( [ vadd ] ) are necessary in order to interpret the lhc missing energy signals .",
    "such assumptions are not needed for the molecular physics bounds , which are not sensitive to physics at very short distances .",

    "( [ vadd ] ) from molecular distance scales to nuclear distance scales , for an effect to be observable at molecular physics scales , the gravitational interaction must grow so rapidly at smaller distances that gravity becomes strong and non - perturbative already in the mev scale .",
    "one would generally expect that strong gravity effects would already have been observed in scattering experiments , either through black hole creation , missing energy due to particles moving into the extra dimensions or other strong gravity effects , or large contributions to binding energies of nucleons and quarks . however , these expectations depend on a theory of gravity in the strong regime , and furthermore hadronic and nuclear binding is not a high - precision science , unlike atomic and molecular physics . here",
    "we take the attitude that we are constraining the possibility that the gravitational force has a higher - dimensional dependence on @xmath18 in the weak regime , where the computations are reliable , and we do not commit ourselves to what happens in the strong domain , where we can not compute reliably .",
    "our constraints are relevant only if gravity has a very soft behavior at shorter distances , so that its direct effects have escaped detection so far",
    ".    the idea that gravity at short distances may be soft has been explored in four dimensions in several contexts .",
    "this includes asymptotically safe gravity @xcite , _ fat gravitons _ as a possible solution to the cosmological constant problem @xcite , a way of avoiding black holes and singularities in string theory  @xcite , and bouncing or self - inflating universes @xcite .",
    "therefore , given the limitations of our current understanding it is not unthinkable that this could happen in higher dimensions as well .",
    "the alternative approaches for constraining compactification scales of extra dimensions , partially surveyed here , are all complementary as they probe different length and energy scales .",
    "some approaches serve to produce tighter limits , however , often at the expense of additional assumptions . in the present study ,",
    "the constraints are derived from precision measurements on molecules , leading to straightforward interpretations .",
    "current state - of - the - art experiments on neutral hydrogen determine vibrational splittings of the order of @xmath102 @xmath68 , or 3 mhz  @xcite .",
    "since the lifetimes of ro - vibrational quantum states in h@xmath0 are of the order of @xmath103 s  @xcite , measurements of vibrational splittings of the order of @xmath104 hz could in principle be possible at more than 20-digit precision , which leaves room for improvement  at the bottom \" of over 10 orders of magnitude , if experimental techniques can be developed accordingly .",
