    "( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "of particular interest is the randall - sundrum type ii ( rsii ) scenario , where the brane is embedded in an einstein space sourced by a negative cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the effective localization of the graviton zero - mode on the brane can be understood within the ads / cft context by interpreting the model as a cut  off , strongly coupled conformal gauge theory coupled to four  dimensional einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "this holographic dual formulation of the rsii scenario can be viewed as a four - dimensional theory in its own right with an effective action comprised of a sum of contributions , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 represents the einstein - hilbert action ( including a possible cosmological constant ) , @xmath9 represents standard matter fields and @xmath10 is the action for the conformal anomaly of the gauge theory @xcite . in the spatially isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology ,",
    "such a dual interpretation modifies the form of the friedmann equation away from the standard @xmath11 dependence on the energy density .",
    "here we investigate whether such modifications to the cosmic dynamics may leave an observable signature in the cmb . as well as",
    "providing a causal mechanism for generating the primordial spectrum of density perturbations , inflation also produces a spectrum of tensor ( gravitational wave ) fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a direct detection of the amplitude and tilt of such a spectrum would yield crucial information on the energy scale of inflation .",
    "moreover , in conventional single - field slow - roll inflation , the amplitudes of the perturbation spectra , @xmath12 , are related to the tensorial tilt , @xmath13 , through a ` consistency ' equation that is independent of the form of the inflaton potential : . ]",

    "we determine the prospects for detecting such a departure in future cmb polarization experiments .",
    "polarization of the cmb represents the most promising route toward a direct detection of the gravitational wave background , since the divergence - free @xmath15-mode of the polarization anisotropy can only be produced ( at leading - order ) by tensor perturbations @xcite .",

    "we find that a departure from the standard inflationary consistency equation could in principle be detectable if the amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum exceeds @xmath17 .",
    "we begin by summarizing the derivation of the modified form of the friedmann equation in the holographic dual of the rsii scenario .",
    "the dual four - dimensional action can be calculated from the holographic renormalization group approach developed by de boer , verlinde and verlinde @xcite .",
    "this is based on the hamilton - jacobi ( hj ) equation of general relativity @xcite . in this prescription , the fourth - order contribution to the generating functional of the hj equation is identified as the effective action , @xmath10 , for the gauge theory .",
    "the dual action then takes the form @xmath18 , where @xmath8 contains terms that are no higher than second - order in derivatives and includes the einstein action that renders the bulk ads action finite .",
    "( we will assume implicitly that the tension of the brane is tuned to cancel the local ( divergent ) contribution arising from an effective cosmological constant ) .",
    "the matter fields on the brane are described by the action @xmath9 . extremizing the variation of the dual action with respect to the metric tensor yields the gravitational field equations , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the einstein tensor",

    "the specific form of the trace of the cft energy - momentum tensor follows directly from the fourth - order hj equation and is given by @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the ads radius of curvature and is determined in terms of the five - dimensional bulk cosmological constant , @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the five - dimensional planck scale .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is also known from direct calculation in four dimensions @xcite that the trace anomaly has the form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the weyl tensor , @xmath31 is the gauss - bonnet combination of curvature invariants and the constants @xmath32 are determined by the field content of the cft such that @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the number of scalar , fermionic and vector degrees of freedom , respectively , and the fermions are dirac fermions .",

    "it is similar to the sudden future singularities discussed recently by barrow @xcite , although the pressure of the fluid is also divergent in barrow s cases . in effect , the existence of this quiescent singularity delays the onset of inflationary expansion .",

    "<S> observational consequences of inflationary cosmology in the holographic dual of the randall - sundrum type ii braneworld scenario , as motivated by the ads / cft correspondence , are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> high energy corrections to the standard four - dimensional friedmann equation induce a corresponding modification to the form of the single - field inflationary consistency equation based on einstein gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of departure from the standard expression is determined by the ratio , @xmath0 , of the primordial tensor and scalar perturbation amplitudes and the coefficient , @xmath1 , of the conformal anomaly in the dual gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a necessary condition for detecting such a correction with the next generation of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization experiments is that @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the bound is tightened to @xmath3 for values of the central charge that are compatible with known compactifications of type iib string theory as parametrized in terms of f - theory compactification on calabi - yau four - folds . </S>",
    "<S> this is close to the present upper bounds inferred from combined observations of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum and high redshift surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that if such modifications to the inflationary consistency equation are to be observable , the gravitational wave background should be detected in the near future </S>",
    "<S> . a further consequence of the non - standard dynamics at high energies is that the initial state of the universe is a quiescent singularity with a finite density and pressure . </S>"
