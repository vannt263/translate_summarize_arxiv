    "the experimental and theoretical studies of dilute magnetic semiconductors ( see , e.g. the recent review @xcite ) have revived the interest to details of reconstruction of the electronic structure of host materials induced by transition metal ions and concomitant defects .",
    "this interest stems from the fact that the simple vonsovskii - zener model of @xmath3-@xmath0 exchange is apparently not sufficient for an exhaustive explanation of the behavior of the most popular system ( ga , mn)as,@xcite not to mention the wide - gap materials like ( ga , mn)n , ( zn , co)o , ( ti , co)o@xmath4.@xcite not only the localized spin of magnetic ions but also the acceptor or donor - like states in the energy gap related to these ions are involved in the indirect exchange between the magnetic ions responsible for the long - range magnetic order . the nature of these states is the matter of a vivid discussion in the current literature .    in particular , an isolated mn impurity in gaas creates a 0.11 ev acceptor level relative to the top of valence band . besides",
    ", the electrons in the half - filled @xmath5 shell form resonance levels in the middle of this band because of an anomalous stability of the half - filled 3d@xmath6 shell.@xcite since the substitution impurity mn@xmath7 is negatively charged relative to the host semiconductor , localizing a hole makes this defect neutral , and the binding energy of this hole is provided by the combined action of the coulomb potential , central cell substitution potential , hybridization and , maybe , @xmath3-@xmath0 exchange.@xcite at a high enough mn concentration , these acceptor levels form an impurity band and eventually merge with the hole states near the top of the valence band ( see ref . for a detailed discussion of the current experimental situation ) .    according to the available calculations of the electronic spectra of an isolated cu in gap,@xcite",
    "the copper impurity should have a similar electronic structure .",
    "due to the special stability of the filled 3d@xmath8 shell all the 3d levels of the cu impurity are expected to be occupied in the ground state , and the electrical neutrality of cu impurity should be ensured by capturing two holes on cu - related acceptor levels close to the top of the valence band , so that the resulting electron configuration can be denoted as cu(d@xmath9 ) .",
    "indeed such acceptor states were found in cap : cu samples,@xcite although at that time the nature of these states remained unclear .",
    "recently , ferromagnetism with a high curie temperature in @xmath10-type cu - doped gap was detected.@xcite the epr signal of the cu@xmath11 state indicates that the 3@xmath0 shells of cu impurities are unfilled in this material in contradiction to the results of previous numerical calculations .",
    "this discrepancy gives us a motivation to revisit the problem .",
    "we present in this paper the results of numerical calculations of the electronic structure of cu - doped gap .",
    "two different computation schemes are used , which give mutually complementary information about the behavior of weakly and strongly doped materials .",
    "the first one is the conventional local density approximation ( lda ) scheme applied to the lattice of cu@xmath12ga@xmath1p supercells .",
    "similar methods were used for mn@xmath12ga@xmath1pn materials with pn = as , n , p.@xcite the second method is based on the local green function approach.@xcite in this method the hybridization between the local impurity @xmath0-orbitals and bloch waves in the host semiconductor is calculated exactly , without any kind of artificial periodic boundary conditions , and approximations are made only when taking into account the short - range part of substitution impurity potential .",
    "a green function calculation procedure based on the microscopic anderson model @xcite was proposed three decades ago @xcite and later on summarized in ref .",
    ". this procedure deals with the local green function @xmath13 the set @xmath14 includes both the electron states @xmath15 of the electrons localized in the d - shell of impurity atom and the states @xmath16 , which stand for `` the bloch tail '' of the impurity wave function .",
    "these states describe the distortion inserted by a substitution impurity in the spectrum of a host crystal .",
    "they are superpositions of the bloch waves , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the wave vector and the band index respectively , @xmath20 is the spin quantum number . here",
    "@xmath21 is the index of the irreducible representation of the point group characterizing the symmetry of impurity and its surrounding , and @xmath22 denotes its row .",
    "therefore the function @xmath23 is diagonal in @xmath24 representation .",
    "the full hamiltonian @xmath25 includes the kinetic and potential energies of all electrons in the impurity atom and in the host crystal , as well as the coulomb and exchange interactions between these electrons .",
    "the projection procedure ( [ green ] ) is exact in principle , and the poles of the green function @xmath26 describe both continuous and localized impurity related states in the doped crystal . in the practical realization of this method",
    "some approximations are unavoidable .",
    "the main simplification , which we use here is the approximate treatment of the substitution potential @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the potential landscape for an electron in the host gallium atom in the site @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the self - consistent potential for the electrons in the @xmath5 shell of the cu ion substituting for ga in this site ( see section iii for detailed definition of these potentials ) .",
    "we suppose that this potential is localized within the defect cell of the doped crystal .",
    "the `` local substitution potential '' approximation influences only the description of @xmath10-type acceptor states in the lower part of the forbidden energy band .",
    "it ignores possible contribution of the coulomb component of substitution impurity potential .",
    "this contribution is known to be small in the case of ( mn , ga)as,@xcite and one may hope for a similar situation in ( cu , ga)p .",
    "the principal advantage of the local substitution potential is that in this case the system of dyson equations for the impurity - related components of the green function ( [ green ] ) defined as @xmath31 may be solved analytically @xcite .",

    ", the green function ( [ dgreen ] ) describes the hybridization between the impurity @xmath0-electron orbitals and the electrons in the imperfect host crystal , where the band electrons are influenced by the potential scattering @xmath43 .",
    "if this scattering is strong enough , it results in splitting off of localized levels from the top of the valence band .",
    "this effect is also taken into account in ( [ dgreen ] ) : the positions of the corresponding levels before the hybridization are determined by zeros of the function @xmath44 in the energy gap of the host crystal .",
    "one of the fundamental statements of the theory of transition metal impurities in semiconductors @xcite is the necessity to discriminate between the impurity levels in the gap obtained as solutions of a self - consistent mean - field schrdinger equation for a doped crystal and the true addition / extraction energy of a @xmath0-electron to / from the valence / conduction band .",
    "the latter energies are determined by the energy balance of `` allen reactions''@xcite @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the total energy of doped crystal with the impurity having @xmath10 electrons in 3d shell .",
    "two allen reactions describe the electron transition from the top of the valence band @xmath47 to the empty neutral ( acceptor ) level and the electron transition from an occupied charged ( donor ) level to the bottom of the conduction band @xmath48 , so that the energies ( [ allen ] ) characterize the true positions of the impurity levels with respect to the band edges in the presence of strong coulomb and exchange interactions .",
    "these energies do not necessarily coincide with the mean - field solutions of the schrdinger equation due to the violation of koopmans theorem for the impurity ions .    to minimize the mismatch between the single - electron and many - electron states",
    ", slater proposed a concept of `` transition state '' . according to his arguments ,",
    "the ionization energy for a state with @xmath19 electrons in the 3d shell , @xmath49 may be approximated by the energy @xmath50 calculated within the lda single - electron calculation scheme .",

    "we test below both the lda+u method of green function calculations and the standard lda supercell description of dilute ( gu , ga)p semiconductor .",

    "we retain the spin index , having in mind to use the spin - unrestricted lsda+u version of this method for the calculation of spin properties of dilute magnetic semiconductors , although in the practical calculations below only the spin - independent lda+u version is used .",
    "the lda + u method incorporates a correction to the lda energy functional which provides an improved description of the electron correlations .",
    "the principal idea of the lda + u method is to separate the electron system into two subsystems of the localized @xmath0-electrons for which the coulomb interaction is accounted for by the hubbard repulsion term @xmath55 in the model hamiltonian whereas the delocalized @xmath3- and @xmath10-electrons are described by an orbital independent one electron potential @xmath56 .    as a result",
