    "we have therefore performed a fourier analysis of the light curves in the combined data base in the three bands macho m@xmath5  and m@xmath4  and ogle i with the mufran code ( multi - frequency analysis , kollth 1990 ) .",
    "the ogle v  band data set is generally sparse and less useful in the detection of ula variables .",
    "the analysis is performed in the 0  0.99d@xmath13 frequency range , but the plotted frequency range in the subsequent figures is 0.004  0.99 d@xmath13 , so as to avoid both the yearly and the daily aliases .",
    "one has to be careful not to miss a potential longer period that can occur in some ellipsoidals @xcite .",
    "we have sifted obvious outlying points from the light curves prior to analysis . in this paper",
    "all quoted amplitudes refer to fourier amplitudes .",
    "they are determined with mufran with a sinusoidal linear least - squares fit to the light curve using the frequency from the dominant fourier peak .",
    "we first reduce the set of over 3000 objects to those in which there are coincidences among the 8 largest fourier peaks in m@xmath5  and ogle i. for the standard , large amplitude cepheids the peaks are very sharp , and these variable stars are thus readily identified . in the case of the ula stars , the fourier peaks m@xmath5  amplitudes fall well below 0.01mag , but nevertheless there are coincidences among the m@xmath5  and i peaks .",
    "each of these cases has to be examined individually to ascertain that the detected variability is not spurious .",
    "for this purpose we also use the m@xmath4  data .",
    "we mention in passing that the typical m@xmath5 , m@xmath4  and ogle i  window functions have a very large sharp central peak with yearly side peaks at least 45% lower , but otherwise are very dull .",
    "we note one peculiarity with the fourier spectra which is a result of the extremely large 1 day alias of the data : all significant peaks of frequency @xmath14 occur with an alias at @xmath15 , _ i.e. _ ,  with peaks placed symmetrically around the frequency 0.5d@xmath13 .",
    "the peaks can be of comparable amplitude .",
    "the ambiguity of the period determination can generally be resolved by a comparison of the peaks in m@xmath5 , m@xmath4 , ogle i  and v. when the symmetrically placed peak is absent , which happens when the original peak is barely above the noise , it likely is an indication that the frequency is spurious .",
    "the objects we have found have been grouped into a singly periodic and a multiperiodic set , and will present them separately .",
    "figure  [ 1 ] displays _ all the singly periodic _ variables that we have uncovered in a period  magnitude ( pm ) diagram .",
    "@xmath16 is the wesenheit function , a reddening - free magnitude estimate .",
    "we now attempt to identify the nature of these objects .",
    "the black dots in fig .  [ 1 ] fall on two parallel bands which correspond to the fundamental and overtone classical cepheids .",
    "they are included in the figures for reference purposes .",
    "all these cepheids have i band amplitudes greater than @xmath170.015mag .",
    "the red and orange symbols below the classical cepheids have relatively large amplitudes .",
    "we will return to them below .",
    "the 25 ula variables we have found are listed in table  [ tab : ula ] .",
    "all objects have i band amplitudes less than 0.0067 , except for sc15  5854 which has an amplitude of 0.0115 .",
    "the first two columns of table  [ tab : ula ] give the macho and ogle names , respectively , followed by the average i magnitude and ( v  i ) color , and the period , @xmath8 , frequency @xmath18 , and the fourier amplitudes in m@xmath5  and in ogle i. the frequency @xmath9 ( and period ) is optimized in a linear squares fourier fit to the m@xmath5  data starting with the highest m@xmath5spectral peak .",
    "the penultimate column denotes the bands in which there is a strong common peak in the fourier spectra . by strong we mean that its amplitude stands out by at least a factor of two above the noise level .",
    "the asterisk in the last column denotes stars that were already discussed by @xcite .",
    "we have plotted the ula variables as light blue and cyan circles .",
    "for the four ula objects that are branded with an x , the evidence for very low amplitude periodicity is a little less strong in the sense that it does not satisfy all our criteria .",
    "we will return to them shortly .    because of the observational noise we have no way of distinguishing ula pulsating stars from ellipsoidal variables .",
    "however , we shall argue that there are very few ellipsoidals in our sample .",
    "for that purpose we present figure  [ 2 ] which locates , unencumbered , _ only _ the ula variables in the whole range we have analyzed , namely the @xmath6 range corresponding to the chosen parallelogram in the hr diagram ( see  1 ) and the frequency range from 0.004 to 0.99d@xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  @xmath7[d ] = 0.0044  2.40 . the way the ula objects cluster near the instability strip in the pm diagram suggests that a large majority of the objects are intrinsic variables and",

    "@xcite each frame was processed with the dophot photometry program . in this way",
    "independent psf profile photometry of each object was derived , supplemented with astrometric information ( current x , y position ) obtained via psf fitting . as a result",
    "proper motions can be inferred .",
    "in fact , unpublished ogle - iii data suggests that 9 objects show proper motion , which in turn suggests that they are foreground stars .",
    "they are represented as smaller cyan filled circles in figs .",
    "[ 1 ] and [ 2 ] , and are branded with a dagger in column 10 of table  [ tab : ula ] . however ,",
    "if they are indeed foreground stars in the solar vicinity that overlap in the cmd with the lmc instability strip @xcite it is nevertheless curious that 6 of them , additionally , appear so near the lmc classical cepheid pm relations , and the other 3 cluster just below .    if they are foreground stars , one would think that they are some sort of main - sequence ellipsoidal binary in the solar vicinity .",
    "generally , spectra can be used to tell giants from dwarfs and to derive radial velocities , so potentially foreground or lmc status could be investigated by spectral observations , along with radial velocity variations to check binarity _ vs.  _ pulsation .    for completeness",
    ", we note that we have also found one egregious large amplitude variable in the database , _ viz .  _",
    "sc8  81586 ( 79.5626.10 ) . despite the relative sparsity of its ogle and macho data and the noisiness of its macho data",
    "this object has a sharply defined period of @xmath19 = 1.0589d , and relatively large amplitudes ( @xmath10 = 0.024 , @xmath11 = 0.025 , @xmath20 = 0.036 ) .",
    "it is depicted as a green diamond in the upper left side in fig .  [ 1 ] .    [ 8 ]      plots of the results of our fourier analysis of each of these objects",
    "would take up too much space in this paper .",
    "we therefore give just a few representative examples .",
    "our figures are in a standard format and contain : ( 1 )  panels with the amplitude fourier spectra for the m@xmath5 , m@xmath4  and ogle i , respectively , plotted for a frequency range of 0.004 to 0.99 d@xmath13 .",
    "( 2 ) panels with the actual data points on the bottom right ;   because the ogle observations start three and 3/4 years ( 1376.5 days ) after the macho observations we have shifted them backwards in time in the ogle panel for better visualization . ( 3 ) panels on the top right side that display the light curves folded with the period that is indicated on top of the figure ;   the macho and ogle data have been phased by taking the 1376.5d shift into account .",
    "the solid red curves in the top right panels represent single frequency harmonic fits to the phased and folded m@xmath5 m@xmath4 , and ogle i  data . in some cases",
    "we have made small adjustments to the folding period @xmath9 to improve the phasing .",
    "the analyses of sc8  76141 , sc14  7197 , and sc11  325504 are exhibited in figs .  [ 3 ]  [ 5 ] .",
    "they are among the top 16 objects of table  [ tab : ula ] and they satisfy all our criteria for variability , _ viz .  _ clear peaks in all 3 bands , a strong 1 day alias , good consistent phasing of the folded light curves .    finally , we wish to give two examples of variability at the confidence limit .",
    "[ 6 ] displays the analysis of sc13  178852 .",
    "the ogle idata have a very convincing spectrum with a dominant peak at 0.3947d@xmath13 . while the corresponding peak is indeed the largest in m@xmath5  and m@xmath4 , one would perhaps not have claimed variability on the basis of the macho or the ogle data alone .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the _ same _ object would show common peaks , however weak if the variability were not real .",
    "note also that the m@xmath5  spectrum shows the 1-f alias and that there is a strong hint of it in the ogle i  spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the folded light curves show in - phase variability .    in fig .",
    "[ 7 ] we present perhaps our weakest case ( sc15  196983 ) for variability .",
    "ogle i  and m@xmath4  have their dominant peak at f@xmath21 = 0.3261d@xmath13 .",
    "ogle i  has a strong 1 day alias peak at 0.6739 , which is also present in m@xmath4  albeit just barely .",
    "however this is the prominent peak in m@xmath5  where the f@xmath21 peak is hidden in the grass. we have chosen the f@xmath21 peak as the actual frequency of this object for two reasons : first because it is the dominant peak in the ogle i  data which have the cleanest spectrum , and second , because the other peak gives a bad phasing between the folded macho and ogle data .",
    "since many of the objects lie in crowded fields the question arises as to the reliability of our assignments .",
    "the variability analysis and the periods that have been determined are immune to contamination by neigboring objects unless those objects have variability themselves or our object is part of a binary , for example .",
    "on the other hand , contamination by a neighboring object will affect the magnitude and the color of our objects .",
    "we have looked in some detail at the 3 objects sc4  62503 , sc5  124597 and sc4  295930 , for example .",
    "the first two are isolated objects , but the third one is a messy clump , so it is possible ( but not necessary ) that the photometry of this last object is poor .",
    "this will apply to both the ogle and macho data .",
    "i for this object is 1.38 , way outside the typical range ( see the cm plot of fig  8",
    ". a further look at sc4  295930 in i - m@xmath5 , v - m@xmath4  and v - i reveals that i is anomalously bright , by at least 0.5 mag .",
    "consequently , it should be shifted down in the pm plot and could well be a regular classical cepheid of very low amplitude rather than a strange cepheid .",
    "we now turn to fig .",
    "the top panel is a blowup of the pm ( @xmath7 , @xmath6 ) plot of fig .",
    "[ 1 ] , and the bottom panel is the corresponding cm ( v  i , i ) plot .",
    "all the objects that are listed in table  [ tab : ula ] and in @xcite are identifiable in the figure .",
    "the squares , diamonds , filled circles and upright triangles indicate the newly found ulas .",
    "the filled circles locate the potential foreground objects .",
    "the xs denote the 5 variables that are in common with the previous work of @xcite which concentrated on macho field 77 .",
    "the crosses are their additional variables that lie marginally outside the cut that defines this paper s data base ( see  1 ) . for reference",
    "we have again plotted the classical cepheids as small black dots .",
    "these ula objects are certainly a mixture of pulsating stars with perhaps a few ellipsoidals that can also have amplitudes in the millimag range .",
    "of course , the ula cepheids have to satisfy the known pm relations , but it is difficult to distinguish between these two types of low amplitude variability .",
    "one notes that 20 objects of table  [ tab : ula ] fall into the classical cepheid range , in both the pm and the cm diagrams .",
    "most of the ula objects fall outside of or near the edges of the f and o1 instability strips .",
    "that ula cepheids would be at the edges of the instability strip is consistent with theory @xcite .",
    "however one might claim that the figure indicates that the ula objects form two separate , parallel fundamental and overtone pm relations in which case they would be physically distinct from the regular cepheids(perhaps on the first crossing of the instability strip rather than on the second or third crossings on the blue loop ) .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram , unfortunately has too much scatter to provide any discriminating information .",
    "one object , sc15  5854 , with a period of 1.0674d lies in the continuation of the cepheid pm relation and falls into the cm range of the cepheids , albeit quite beyond the tip .",
    "there is a cluster of 6 stars that falls below the cepheid pm relation with periods 23 times longer than that of classical cepheids of the same magnitude .",
    "three of them are possibly foreground stars , as discussed in  2 .",
    "again , we can not be sure that these objects are not ellipsoidals , but it seems unlikely because of the clustering in pm .",
    "furthermore , 4 of them ( sc9  127569 , sc20  181340 , sc1  335382 , and sc13  191166 ) also cluster in cm .",
    "this suggests that they are pulsators rather than ellipsoidals . what is their nature ?",
    "they are unlikely to be classical cepheids because they have too small a brightness for their period , and potential contamination by neighboring objects would move them even lower in the pm diagram .",
    "it is possible that these stars are also ula population ii stars .",
    "however , sc5  416555 , which is very blue is perhaps an ellipsoidal .",
    "the star sc2  357794 , marked with an inverted triangle in fig .",
    "8 , falls into the proper cm range , but it has a period a factor of @xmath175 smaller than the fundamental cepheid period , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  the period the star would have if it pulsated in the f mode . the theoretical work of @xcite has shown that some cepheids can pulsate in a surface mode with a period that is about a factor of 45 shorter than the corresponding fundamental period .",
    "this object therefore is possibly a strange cepheid @xcite .",
    "but one can not rule out that the light curve might be contaminated by a bright nearby star in which case it could be a regular ula cepheid as we already suggested for object sc5  124597 that @xcite had identified as a strange cepheid candidate .",
    "object sc1  330647 is a little offset with @xmath22 15 and @xmath23 and lies in the w  vir instability region ( see fig .  [ 1 ] .",
    "it could be a ula w  vir star although its v  i color is very blue .",
    "we conclude that most if not all of the ula singly periodic objects in the data set are pop .",
    "i and pop .",
    "ii cepheids , with the caveat that some might be foreground stars or ellipsoidals .",
    "we now turn to the larger amplitude singly periodic stars that are exhibited in table  [ tab : popii ] .",

    "ii or rv  tau in red in fig .",
    "1 . their identifiers , their average i magnitudes , wesenheit magnitudes @xmath6 and their periods ( or cycling times )",
    "are given in table  [ tab : popii ] .",
    "the first two columns give the macho and ogle names .",
    "all these stars have i  band fourier amplitudes in the range 0.01 to 0.25 .",
    "an exception is the ula sc3  201554 with harmonic peak amplitudes of 0.0065 and 0.0075 , that is shown in yellow .",
    "the objects that are displayed as triangles have regular light curves .",
    "one object , sc4  53483 , has a crested top light curve that is typical of some w vir stars .",
    "the remainder show behavior with cycle to cycle alternations .",
    "these alternations are regular ( squares ) for some and some semi - regular ( circles ) .",
    "the period association is sometimes ambiguous by a factor of 2 when alternations are present .",
    "we have not chosen the period with the highest fourier peak , but somewhat arbitrarily the one that gives visually the folded light curve with the least scatter .",
    "one notes that all but 2 points would fall on 2 parallel , relatively tight pm relations that are separated by 0.3 ( factor of 2 in p ) .",
    "the binaries ( orange ) fall predominantly on the right sequence , and the pop .",
    "ii / rv  tau stars ( red ) predominantly on the left one .    actually , from a physical point of view , for the pulsating stars the shorter period is more relevant as it corresponds to the linearly excited pulsational mode , whereas the longer period arises through period doubling that is caused by nonlinear effects ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    for the binaries , the reverse situation holds . here",
    "there are also two sequences separated by 0.3 in @xmath7 because the `` no alt '' stars can adopt a period equal to half the orbital period ( there are two maxima per orbit ) .",
    "but , why does the binary sequence exist ?",
    "we will argue that it is because stars on the blue loops have a certain size at a given luminosity and color , and if they have a companion that is capable of causing ellipsoidal variations , it must be at a small multiple of the stellar radius",
    ". this radius increases with luminosity ( i ) and color ( v - i ) .",
    "the conversion to @xmath6 will tend to take out the v - i variation along tracks at given luminosity . if we remember that for both orbits and pulsation , @xmath24 , and that the period of the fundamental pulsation mode is not too different from the orbital period at the stellar surface , we can see that qualitatively the binary sequence should be parallel to the pulsation sequence : more detailed computations would be needed to estimate the exact shift in @xmath7 .",
    "the stars on the binary sequence should therefore be in the lmc .",
