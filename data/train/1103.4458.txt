    "the classical approaches to fermat@xmath1s last theorem ( flt ) are essentially of a @xmath2-adic nature in the @xmath2th cyclotomic field ; thus these studies turn to be arithmetic modulo @xmath2 , in which case the distinction between first and second case is necessary but unnatural as wiles@xmath1s proof suggests . even if the starting point is of a global nature ( @xmath2th powers of ideals , classes , units , logarithmic derivative of eichler ,  ) , the conclusion of the study is mostly local ( congruences modulo  @xmath2 ) as we can see for instance in ribenboim and washington@xmath1s books [ r , wa ] .",
    "we don@xmath1 t know ( for instance in the first case of flt ) if @xmath2-adic investigations ( kummer@xmath1s congruences , mirimanoff or thaine@xmath1s congruences , wieferich or wendt@xmath1s criteria ,  ) are able , from a logical point of view , to succeed in proving it .",
    "we think that probably not and we think that all these dramatically numerous necessary conditions can , in some sense , be satisfied in a very rare `` numerical setting '' , as for the question of vandiver@xmath1s conjecture for which we have given a probabilistic study in [ gr1 , ii.5.4.9.2 ] : the number of favourable primes less than @xmath2 ( for a counterexample ) can be of the form @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "this is to be relativized with the result of soul [ s ] showing ( after that of kurihara [ ku ] for @xmath5 ) that for odd @xmath6 , the real components @xmath7 of the @xmath2-class group and the corresponding eigenspaces @xmath8 , also denoted @xmath9 , @xmath10 ; see not.2.7 , and th.2.8 , subsec.2.3 . ]",
    "are trivial for any large @xmath2 .",
    "this result and the well - known relative case indicate that the probabilities are not uniform in the following way :    for small values of odd @xmath6 , the real components @xmath7 are trivial ( deep result of [ ku , s ] ) and for small values of even @xmath11 , the relative components @xmath12 are trivial ( because of the evident nondivisibility by @xmath2 of the first bernoulli numbers @xmath13 ) ; so that the real components @xmath14 , for a small odd @xmath15 , and the relative components @xmath16 , for a small even @xmath17 , are trivial , which implies , by reflection , that the real components @xmath18 are trivial and the cyclotomic units @xmath19 are not local @xmath2th powers at @xmath2 . and @xmath20 being a local @xmath2th power ( @xmath21 even ) is given by the theory of @xmath2-adic @xmath22-functions or the reflection theorem ; see example 2.9 . ]    in the particular speculative case of the existence of a solution in the first case of fermat@xmath1s equation , from results of krasner [ kr ] , [ g2 ] , and many authors , for small values of odd @xmath23 , the last bernoulli numbers @xmath24 must be divisible by @xmath2 , say @xmath25 for a small odd @xmath26 , giving the nontriviality of the relative components @xmath27 and the fact that the cyclotomic units @xmath28 are _ local _",
    "@xmath2th powers ( but not global @xmath2th powers because of the previous result of soul , at least up to min@xmath29 ) , which creates a significant defect for the probabilities .    as we see from the classical literature , strong diophantine or analytic arguments are absent , even when the @xmath2-rank of the class group is involved since this @xmath2-rank is used as a formal variable . moreover the second case is rarely studied .    of course a great part of the point of view developped here is not really new ( many papers of the early twentieth century , contain overviews of our point of view ) but we intend to organize the arguments in a more conceptual and accessible way , mainly to avoid bernoulli@xmath1s numbers considerations , and to suggest forthcoming studies in a more diophantine or analytic context by using radicals instead of ideal classes .",
    "we will see on this occasion that class field theory , in its various aspects , allows us to find again _ all _ classical technical properties , without dreadful computations .",
    "some papers already go partially in this direction ( e.g. angls [ a2 , a3 ] , granville [ g1 , g2 ] , helou [ he1 , he2 ] , terjanian [ te ] , thaine [ th1 , th2 , th3 ] , and many others ) .    finally , we must mention that all these studies strongly depend on the base field ( here @xmath30 ) since it is shown in [ a2 ] that many results or conjectures fail for the fermat equation over a number field @xmath31 .",
    "in section 1 we recall some basic facts for the convenience of the reader ; they can also be found for instance in washington@xmath1s book [ wa ] .    in section 2",
    "we recall some very useful properties of class field theory ( notion of @xmath2-primarity which avoids painful computations , reflection theorems in the general setting developped in [ gr1 , ii.5.4 ] ) and we introduce the radical @xmath32 associated to a solution in any case of the fermat equation .",
    "then we explain the insufficiency of the local study of flt , and we put the bases of a global approach with @xmath32 which does not separate the first and second cases of flt .",
    "we also examine the influence of a solution of the fermat equation on other arithmetic invariants .    in section 3 , for the first case of flt , we study @xmath2-adically the radical @xmath32 , introduced in section 2 , and show how mirimanoff@xmath1s polynomials are related to this radical , without use of bernoulli@xmath1s numbers ; moreover we modify these polynomials by introducing the characters of the galois group , which illuminates the class field theory context .    from this ,",
    "we show that the classical kummer and mirimanoff congruences are directly the expression of reflection theorems .    to be complete , we revisit some @xmath2-adic studies , as those of eichler [ e1 , e2 ] , covering works of brckner [ br1 , br2 ] and skula [ sk1 , sk2 ] .",
    "we then return to the well - known fact that wieferich@xmath1s criterion is a consequence of reciprocity law and , in an appendix , we give a proof suggested by qume ; for this simpler proof , we interpret , with current technics , some works of fueter  takagi ( 1922 ) and inkeri ( 1948 ) ( see [ r , ix.4 ] ) which do not use reciprocity law .",
    "finally we give a standard proof of the germain ",
    "wendt theorem , and introduce some ( perhaps new ) ideas to compare mirimanoff@xmath1s polynomials and gauss@xmath1s sums , and to study `` mirimanoff@xmath1s sums '' defined as sums of roots of unity .    in section 4 ,",
    "we give some conclusions and prospectives in various directions .",

    "we have @xmath970 ; this number has been used for instance in the following papers : [ ls ] ( for a similar purpose as us ) and [ a - hb ] , [ f ] to prove that the first case of flt holds for infinitely many primes @xmath2 .    see [ r , iv.4 ] for its explicit computation via wendt@xmath1s determinant .",
    "if @xmath971 this means that fermat@xmath1s equation in the residue field @xmath972 of @xmath88 has no nontrivial solutions ; thus if @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 is a solution in @xmath149 of fermat@xmath1s equation , necessarily @xmath89 divides one of these numbers , say @xmath973 .",
    "now we state the following result ( in the spirit of germain@xmath1s theorem ) .",
    "let @xmath974 be a prime number which does not divide the natural integer @xmath975 .",

    "so @xmath983 ; from lemma 1.2 , @xmath984 giving , from @xmath985 , @xmath986 , and @xmath175 , the relation @xmath987 which defines a non trivial solution in @xmath963 ( absurd ) .",
    "the conclusion of the theorem is the same if we replace the hypothesis `` @xmath988 is not a @xmath2th power modulo @xmath989 '' , by `` @xmath990 '' since in that case , wieferich@xmath1s criterion is not satisfied for @xmath89 .",
    "* appendix .",
    "wieferich@xmath1s criterion without reciprocity law * ( from a proof rediscovered by roland qume ) .",
    "we use the same notations as in subsection 3.6 . see also notations 2.7 .",
    "let @xmath81 be a prime number .",
    "we suppose that by choosing suitable @xmath867 , @xmath868 among @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , we have @xmath991 and @xmath992 in the writing @xmath993 = { \\mathfrak z}^p_1 $ ] ( valid in any case of fermat@xmath1s equation ) .",

    "we know that @xmath995 ( another application of the reflection theorem ; see [ gr1 , ii.5.4.6.3 ] ) , so that @xmath996 , @xmath997 , @xmath998 ; hence @xmath999 for @xmath1000 .",
    "thus this yields : @xmath1001    hence the relation @xmath1002 where @xmath1003 ( a @xmath2th power ) modulo @xmath89 , proving that : @xmath1004    but @xmath1005 is equivalent to @xmath1006 ; using remark 3.4 ( @xmath1007 ) we get immediately @xmath1008 .",
    "if moreover @xmath1009 ( e.g. first case of flt , or second case with @xmath1010 ) we obtain the result on wieferich@xmath1s criterion in the same way as in subsection 3.6 , without any use of the reciprocity law .",
    "we have shown that much of the classical literature on flt has been concerned with very basic facts of class field theory , often rediscovered by means of painful congruential computations ; but recall that class field theory is essentially algebraic as soon as , for instance , ebotarev@xmath1s density theorem is not used ( among other analytic tools ) , and that , algebrically , all is `` possible '' .",
    "so it appears that this approach is relatively poor , despite the power of class field theory to enunciate technical properties .",
    "moreover , most of the arguments are local , especially _ local at @xmath2_. of @xmath47 is in @xmath1011 if and only if @xmath1012 for all @xmath1013 , where the prime ideals @xmath1014 generate the @xmath2-class group of @xmath47 ( see [ gr1 , exer .",
    "ii.6.3.8 ] ) ; but this criterion is not effective . ]    the fact that the relative class group takes place in these studies does not change our point of view since it is utilized without serious analytic arguments ( except the unusable upperbound @xmath1015 and the ingenious but elementary derivation technic of eichler ) .",
    "moreover the analytic class number formula for the relative class group is not really analytic since it is , roughly speaking , equivalent to stickelberger@xmath1s theorem and is , in some sense , algebraic ( the main theorem on cyclotomic fields gives a better knowledge of the class field theory aspects , but it is not really necessary ) .",
    "it is likely that the most serious _ cyclotomic _ approaches are the study of `` mirimanoff@xmath1s sums '' , since at least half of them must be zero modulo @xmath830 , and that of wendt@xmath1s criterion since it is connected with the theory of prime numbers ; but all this only concerns the first case of flt , which is unnatural .    still in the first case , from the well - known class field theory exact sequence of @xmath409-modules : @xmath1016 where @xmath216 is the maximal abelian @xmath2-ramified pro-@xmath2-extension of @xmath47 , @xmath433 the group of principal units of @xmath345 , @xmath1017 the closure in @xmath433 of the group of global units @xmath1018",
    ", we get for any _ even _ character @xmath305 : @xmath1019 where all groups are @xmath2-torsion groups since @xmath305 is even . for @xmath2 large enough , the result of kurihara ",
    "soul is @xmath1020 ; suppose that it is possible to extend it to @xmath1021 ( taking `` @xmath2-ramification '' instead of `` nonramification '' ) , then @xmath1022 which means that the fundamental @xmath1023-unit @xmath1024 is not a local @xmath2th power and that the fundamental @xmath1023-cyclotomic unit @xmath1025 ( equal to @xmath1024 since @xmath1026 ) is not a local @xmath2th power , which is equivalent to @xmath1027 , in other words to @xmath1028 , which would contradict the first case of flt ( at least for @xmath2 large enough ) .",
    "we believe more in the possibility of a _ nonalgebraic _ study of the radical generated by @xmath41 , @xmath237 , @xmath233 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 and their conjugates , which would be independent of the considered case of flt , and which is not equivalent to a general study of the group @xmath1029 because as a matter of fact we are concerned with very specific @xmath2-classes , the same remark being valid for the utilization of other arithmetical invariants of @xmath47 .",
    "as the referee mentions , all these invariants are isomorphic or dual to adequate tate twists of the cohomology group @xmath1030 ( where @xmath399 is the galois group of the maximal @xmath2-ramified pro-@xmath2-extension of @xmath47 ) which relativizes the interest , but we don@xmath1 t know if the use of the pseudo - units @xmath481 in these contexts leads , in practice , to the same `` numerical '' criteria and to the same diophantine approach .",
    "it is indeed surprising that , to our knowledge , there is no important diophantine results on the mixed radical @xmath32 , using simultaneously @xmath1031 , and possibly the cyclotomic numbers , which constitutes a particular case of the study of the polynomial identity , in the polynomial ring @xmath1032 $ ] : @xmath1033    99 b. angls , on some @xmath2-adic power series attached to the arithmetic of @xmath1034 , j. number theory 122 ( 2007 ) , 1 , 221246 .",
