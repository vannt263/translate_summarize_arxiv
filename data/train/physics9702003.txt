    "<S> the dependence on @xmath2 is very strong . </S>",
    "<S> this is the main reason for the disagreement with some previous calculations , which employ bound state wave functions with incorrect asymptotic @xmath2 values . in a number of cases our theoretical results produces best agreement with absolute and relative experimental data .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we use the theory of multiphoton detachment from negative ions developed in our previous work ( gribakin and kuchiev 1996 ) to calculate @xmath0-photon detachment cross sections and excess photon detachment ( epd ) spectra for some negative ions and frequencies , which have been explored experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that for a linearly polarized light the differential @xmath0-photon detachment cross section for the electron in the initial state @xmath4 is @xmath5 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is determined by the initial energy of the electron @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the photoelectron momentum , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are its components parallel and perpendicular to the field , @xmath10 is the speed of light , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the associated legendre function , and @xmath13 is the phase which determines the oscillatory pattern of the photoelectron angular distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is due to interference between the two contributions to the photodetachment amplitude produced at the moments of time when the field strength reaches its maximum ( there are two such instants in every period of the field ) . </S>",
    "<S> the phase @xmath14 varies with the ejection angle of the photoelectron in between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , and can be quite large , even for the lowest-@xmath0 process , @xmath18 , @xmath19 . note that in accordance with the general symmetry properties , the cross section is zero at @xmath20 , when @xmath21 is odd .    </S>",
    "<S> after the electron detachment from a closed - shell negative ion the neutral atom is left in either of the two fine - structure states with the total angular momentum @xmath22 , e.g. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for halogens . in this case the @xmath0-photon detachment cross section summed over the projections of the angular momentum is given by @xmath25 where different values of @xmath2 and binding energies @xmath26 should be used for @xmath22 , since the two sublevels have different detachment thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> the main contribution to the sum in equation ( [ wj ] ) comes from @xmath27 , since these orbitals are extended along the direction of the field .    </S>",
    "<S> the sum over @xmath28 can be carried out analytically , taking into account the fact that @xmath12 in equation ( [ sign ] ) is a function of the imaginary angle @xmath29 , @xmath30 , so that @xmath31 ^*=(-1)^m p_l^{|m|}(\\cos \\vartheta ) $ ] . </S>",

    "<S> this depends on whether the lowest photoelectron partial wave is @xmath47 or @xmath48 </S>",
    "<S> . equations ( [ dsj ] ) and ( [ stot ] ) and figure 1 predict a variety of properties for the photodetachment from all negative ions .    the theory which has lead to equations ( [ sign ] ) and ( [ dsj ] ) shows that the detachment process takes place when the electron is far from the atomic core , at distances estimated as @xmath49 ( gribakin and kuchiev 1996 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is why the probabilities can be expressed in terms of the asymptotic parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the bound - state wave function . </S>",
    "<S> all corrections due to electron - atom scattering or electron correlations , e.g. , the electron - atom polarizational interaction , are expected to be suppressed by some powers of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ stot ] ) enables one to make simple estimates of saturation intensities @xmath50 defined as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the laser pulse duration , @xmath53 ^{1/n}.\\ ] ] for low photoelectron energies @xmath54 , @xmath55 , the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath50 is basically determined by the first factor with @xmath56 , @xmath57 this dependence was first noticed in the numerical calculations by crance ( 1988 ) .    in what follows we use equations ( [ dsj ] ) and ( [ stot ] ) to calculate the cross section for those negative ions and photon frequencies where some experimental data are available . </S>",
    "<S> parameters of the electron bound state wave functions in these negative ions are listed in table [ param ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that if after the detachment the neutral atom is left in its ground state , then @xmath2 is determined by the corresponding electron affinity @xmath58 ( hotop and lineberger 1985 ) , @xmath59 , and if the atom in the final state is excited ( e.g. , to the upper fine - structure level ) , then @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the energy of the atomic excitation ( radtsig and smirnov 1986 ) . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> we are dealing with the detachment of the valence electron , hence , the same value of @xmath1 is used . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with @xmath2 , the values of @xmath1 for most ions are known only to within 10 % or worse . in spite of the fact that the present theory is strictly valid for large @xmath0 </S>",

    "<S> two features are most obvious . </S>",
    "<S> first , our theoretical values are considerably higher than the experimental ones , and second , there is a much better agreement between the relative cross sections , as given by the theory and experiment . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a reasonable agreement between the two calculations for o@xmath65 , br@xmath65 and i@xmath65 .    the large disagreement between our value for f@xmath65 and that of crance 1988 is , as discussed in gribakin and kuchiev ( 1996 ) , due to the incorrect behaviour of the hf bound state wave function , which falls off much faster than the true one ( the hf value of @xmath2 for f@xmath65 is 0.6 , vs the true @xmath72 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that among the halogen negative ions this discrepancy is the largest for f@xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the theoretical cross sections for br@xmath65 and i@xmath65 are in better agreement ( hf values of @xmath73 respectively ; compare to the true values of @xmath74 for @xmath75 , see table [ param ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth pointing out that the calculations for halogens that employed hf wave functions of the photoelectron ( crance 1987a , 1987b ) produced cross sections close to those obtained within the plane - wave approximation . from the point of view of our theory </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the importance of large distances for the multiphoton detachment . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have to conclude that the agreement that the theoretical and experimental values had enjoyed for f@xmath65 was probably coincidental , caused by the significant error in the previous calculations . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the relative magnitudes of the cross sections for f@xmath65 , br@xmath65 and i@xmath65 given by our theory are very close to the measured ones .    the minimal number of quanta needed for the detachment of cl@xmath65 at the nd : yag laser frequency is four . in this instance </S>",

    "<S> , one can calculate the saturation intensities @xmath50 for some @xmath52 , e.g. , @xmath81 , as in blondel and trainham 1989 . using our cross sections and the data from blondel and trainham 1989 we complete table </S>",

    "<S> if the energy of the laser pulse is below the saturation limit , then for a pulse with a gaussian spatial and temporal profile this ratio is given by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 the peak intensity in the pulse . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the experimental points in figure 3 of davidson 1991 display an approximately linear dependence on the intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding slope can be estimated as 0.0415 , if the intensity is in units of @xmath104 w/@xmath86 , which is quite close to our theoretical estimate of 0.0466 . </S>",
    "<S> when the cross sections of crance 1988 are used , a value of 0.053 is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between our theory and that based on the hf description of the negative ion is not as large for the ratio of the cross sections , as it is for the cross sections themselves . at the peak intensity of @xmath105  w/@xmath86 , well into the saturation regime , we calculated the ratio of 4- and 6-photon detachments to be 120 , with the experimental value between 70 and 200 .    </S>",
    "<S> the epd was also measured for au@xmath65 , where 2- , 3- , and possibly 4-photon detachment signals were observed at @xmath71  ev ( stapelfeldt 1991 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the interpretation of that experiment is not straightforward , because already at @xmath106 of the maximal laser intensity of @xmath107 w/@xmath86 achieved in that experiment the @xmath42 channel is closed due to the ponderomotive threshold shift .    equation ( [ dsj ] ) can be used to calculate angular distributions of photoelectrons studied by blondel ( 1991,1992 ) and dulieu ( 1995 ) . for the 2-photon detachment from halogen negative ion at @xmath108  ev </S>",
    "<S> the shapes of the differential cross sections from equation ( [ dsj ] ) are close to those produced by the ` hf @xmath109 plane - wave ' calculations presented in figure 3 of blondel 1992 , the difference in the absolute values aside . </S>",
    "<S> they reproduce well the features of the experimental data . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are in better agreement with the experiment , e.g. , for cl@xmath65 , br@xmath65 ( @xmath23 final state ) , or f@xmath65 , see figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for f@xmath65 the analytical result ( [ dsj ] ) is also in good agreement with the numerical calcultions of pan and starace ( 1991 ) , where electron correlations in the initial , intermediate and final states of the 2-photon process have been taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the largest discrepancy between the theory and experiment is observed for i@xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> similar conslusions can be drawn from the comparison of our angular distributions at @xmath71  ev ( figure 3 of gribakin and kuchiev 1996 ) with the experimental results for f@xmath65 , @xmath110 , cl@xmath65 , @xmath111 , br@xmath65 , @xmath112 , and i@xmath65 , @xmath112 ( blondel 1991 , dulieu 1995 ) . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the simple analytical expression ( [ dsj ] ) reproduces remarkably well the complicated oscillatory pattern of the photoelectron angular distributions .    in summary , our theory of multiphoton detachment in a strong laser field ( gribakin and kuchiev 1996 ) yields very simple formulae for the @xmath0-photon detachment cross sections and photoelectron angular distributions . </S>",
    "<S> apart from @xmath39 and @xmath0 they depend only on the electron orbital angular momentum @xmath62 and the two constants @xmath1 and @xmath2 which characterize the behaviour of the bound - state wave function at large distances . </S>",
    "<S> the correct asymptotic behaviour of the bound - state wave fucntion at large distances is crucial for obtaining correct absolute values of the @xmath0-photon cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the theory is based on the properties of the wave function at large separations from the atom make it very reliable . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> the simple structure of our final results permits make quick estimates of the cross sections for any negative ion . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied the theory to the negative ions and processes studied experimentally , and found that our results are in reasonable , and in some cases , very good agreement with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> some discrepancies found call for more accurate absolute experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> when more sophisticated calculations are performed , our formulae can be used as a benchmark , to demonstrate the role of various possible corrections , which are expected be small for the processes considered . </S>",
    "<S> of course , there are other processes where many - electron correlations play a decisive role , e.g. , multiple photodetachment or ionization ( kuchiev 1987 , 1995 , 1996 ) .    </S>",
