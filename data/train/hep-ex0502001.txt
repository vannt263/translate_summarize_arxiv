    "results from recent neutrino experiments provide strong evidence for neutrino oscillations due to finite neutrino masses and mixings@xcite . their physical origin and experimental consequences are not fully understood .",

    "production of electron anti - neutrinos(@xmath9 ) due to @xmath10-decays of fission products at power reactors is a well - studied process .",
    "there are standard parametrizations for the reactor @xmath9 spectra@xcite .",
    "the typical fission rate at the reactor core with a thermal power of @xmath11 in gw is @xmath12 , while an average about 6 @xmath9/fission are emitted .",
    "the modeling of the @xmath9 energy spectra above 3  mev is consistent with measurements at the @xmath135% level@xcite , while the low energy portion is subjected to much bigger uncertainties@xcite . in a realistically achievable setting at a location 10  m from a core with @xmath11=4.5  gw , the @xmath9-flux is @xmath14 .",
    "nuclear reactors also produce @xmath0 via ( a ) electron capture or inverse beta decay of the fission products and ( b ) neutron activation on the fuel rods and the construction materials at the reactor core .",
    "there were unpublished studies@xcite on the reactor @xmath0-fluxes from early reactor experiments , indicating that they would not contribute to the background in the measurements with @xmath9 .",
    "we extended these studies with realistic simulations , and focused on the potentials of using them as sources to study neutrino physics .",

    "the leading contribution is from @xmath26 , where the yield summed over all four fissile isotopes is @xmath27/fission .",
