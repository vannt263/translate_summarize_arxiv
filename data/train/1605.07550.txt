    "grinin and sobolev @xcite were the first who showed that the optical continuum emission during the impulsive phase of stellar flares is formed near the photosphere .",
    "heating of the deep layers is due to the high energy proton or / and electron beams with the initial energy flux @xmath0 erg@xmath1s@xmath2 and @xmath3 erg@xmath1s@xmath2 , respectively @xcite . in these calculations ,",
    "the authors take into account the energy loss of the suprathermal particles in passing through the red dwarf _ chromosphere _ ( see eqs . ( 1,2 ) in @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite calculated the first gas dynamic model of the impulsive stellar flares ( the cut - off energy @xmath4 kev , the spectral index @xmath5 , the energy flux in the electron beam @xmath6 erg@xmath1s@xmath2 ) . according to this model",
    ", the blue component of the optical continuum is formed in a chromospheric condensation .",
    "the condensation is located between a temperature jump and the front of the downward shock ( the temperature wave of the second kind @xcite ) .",
    "the physical parameters of this source of white - light continuum ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and thickness @xmath9 ) lie in the range of the layer parameters in the model by grinin and sobolev @xcite ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) . here",
    ", @xmath13 is equal to the sum of the proton and atom concentrations .",
    "however , the condensation is formed at height @xmath14 km above the quiescent photosphere of a red dwarf , i.e. in the upper chromosphere .",
    "the downward shock @xcite propagates through _ a partially ionized gas _ of the red dwarf chromosphere .",
    "the flow speed is subsonic for the electron component of the plasma but this speed is hypersonic for the ion - atom component @xcite .",
    "therefore , both ions and atoms are heated more intensively than electrons at the shock front .",
    "thus , the region between the temperature jump and the front of the downward shock is , in fact , _ two - temperature _ ( @xmath15 ) @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath16 is the ion - atom temperature , and @xmath17 is the electron one .",
    "morchenko et al .",
    "@xcite calculated the emission spectrum of a homogeneous pure hydrogen layer with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the layer density lies in the range @xmath20 .",
    "initially , we assume that the lyman-@xmath21 optical depth in the center of the layer , @xmath22 , is approximately equal to @xmath23 ( see eq .",
    "( 1 ) in @xcite ) . however",
    ", then we consider the transition from the transparent gas to the gas whose emission is close to the planck function under conditions when the layer thickness , @xmath24 , is _ fixed _ ( the first paragraph of section 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "the following elementary processes were taken into account : the electron impact ionization , excitation , and de - excitation , the triple recombination , the spontaneous radiative recombination , the spontaneous transitions between discrete energy levels .",
    "we consider the influence of the layer s radiation ( bremsstrahlung and recombination ) on the occupation of atomic levels .",
    "it is necessary , as the flare luminosity is stronger in the optical range than that of the quiescent atmosphere of the whole star .",
    "we take into account the scattering of line radiation in the framework of the biberman - holstein approximation @xcite .",
    "since @xmath25 , photons escape the flare plasma in the distant line wings @xcite .",
    "the following asymptotic formula is valid for the resonance transition : @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is the stark broadening parameter , @xmath28 is the holtsmark field strength , and @xmath29 is the doppler width .",
    "our calculations @xcite have shown that the menzel factors do not differ from unity at values of @xmath30 and higher . moreover , the two - temperature @xmath31 layer with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 generates the blue continuum radiation ( the optical depth at wavelength @xmath35   , @xmath36 , is approximately equal to 6 ) .",
    "we also _ proposed _ that the radiative cooling of the gas behind the downward shock with a constant velocity ( the so - called stationary shock wave ) can produce an equilibrium region , which is responsible for the blackbody radiation during the impulsive phase of stellar flares ( the last sentence in @xcite ) .",
    "the model @xcite includes the one - temperature ( @xmath37 ) source of the white - light continuum .",
    "let us investigate the applicability of the calculations @xcite for a one - temperature layer with @xmath38 .",
    "it is true that @xmath39 therefore , the mean photon escape probability , @xmath40 , as well as the menzel factors of the layer does not depend on the ion - atom temperature .",
    "thus , at @xmath41 numerical results @xcite remain valid .",
    "then it is true that the 10 km layer with parameters from the model @xcite is _ * transparent * _ in the optical continuum ( see the lower curve designated to `` i '' in fig . 2 @xcite ) :",
    "@xmath42 , q.e.d ( quod erat demonstrandum ) . at the same time",
    ", this model can explain increasing the intensity of the hydrogen emission lines in the flare spectra .    in the paper",
    "@xcite we briefly discuss the theoretical possibility of the origin of the blue continuum radiation behind the _ stationary _ shock with _",
    "radiative cooling_. based on a simple estimate it is shown that the planck emission is formed only under conditions when the shock wave propagates on a small distance ( approximately five hundred meters ) .",
