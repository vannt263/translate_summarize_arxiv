    "recent _ in situ _ observations of solar polar regions by _ ulysses _ spacecraft have shown the presence of long - period ( periods of several hours ) outwardly propagating alfvn waves @xcite . the alfvn waves may play a significant role in solar wind acceleration , therefore it is very important to understand the process of their generation .",
    "as the observed alfvn waves show predominantly outward propagation , they probably are of solar origin .",
    "unfortunately no clear physical mechanism explaining the generation of such long - period alfvn waves has been suggested so far .",
    "it is an interesting fact , that the low - frequency oscillations have been observed also in solar lower atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of observed oscillations grows from the center of the solar disc to the limb i.e. the waves are rather tangential than radial . therefore the authors suggested that they can be alfvn waves propagating upwards from the solar interior .",
    "thus the energy source of these alfvn waves can be located well below the solar surface .    here",
    "we suppose that the long - period alfvn waves can be generated in the solar interior by pulsation either in the fundamental radial mode and/or in low frequency g - modes through the recently suggested _ swing wave - wave interaction _ @xcite .",
    "the period of the solar fundamental radial mode is @xmath0 1 hour ; periods of g - modes can be longer .",
    "the presence of a large - scale weak magnetic field in the interior can not affect the pulsation significantly .",
    "however the pulsation causes the periodical variation of some medium parameters ( such as density and magnetic field ) and consequently of the alfvn speed in the interior .",
    "but the periodical variation of alfvn speed either due to sound waves @xcite or fast magnetosonic waves @xcite leads to the amplification of alfvn waves with twice the period of compressible waves . by this mechanism",
    ", it has been shown that the pulsation in the fundamental mode of solar - like stars in binary systems , which is excited by the companion s gravity , may lead to the amplification of double period alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "thus the question naturally arises whether a similar process may occur in the sun . in this case , the solar fundamental pulsation may amplify torsional alfvn waves in the interior with the double period i.e. @xmath0 2 hours , while g - modes may amplify alfvn waves with longer periods .",
    "the generated alfvn waves may propagate upwards and cause the observed oscillations in the photosphere / chromosphere and the solar wind .",
    "it is a very intriguing fact that one of observed oscillation period in the chromosphere is @xmath0 2 hours @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we show how the solar fundamental radial pulsation may amplify the torsional alfvn waves in the interior . as to the coupling of g - modes and alfvn waves ,",
    "it is more complicate to describe it mathematically , therefore we will study it in future .",
    "we start from the ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations : @xmath1@xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the medium density , @xmath7 is the pressure , @xmath8 is the velocity , @xmath9 is the magnetic field , g is the gravitational constant , @xmath10 is the gravitational potential and @xmath11 is the ratio of specific heats .",
    "we consider a medium with zero viscosity , infinite conductivity and negligible displacement current .",
    "we argue that the coupling between pulsation and alfvn waves occurs below the convection zone , therefore we do not consider convective effects and consequently the @xmath12-effect term in the mean field electrodynamics induction equation ( see e.g. belvedere 1985 ) which represents a mean electromotive force generated by cyclonic convection . here and in the remaining part of the paper we also neglect the rotational effects .",
    "the sun is considered to be in hydrostatic equilibrium so that its own gravity is balanced by the pressure gradient .",
    "a slight deviation from the equilibrium leads to an oscillation which may be studied by the linear perturbation theory .",
    "stellar oscillations ( in the absence of magnetic field ) can be divided into two classes : high - frequency p - modes or pressure modes , whose restoring force is the pressure gradient , and low - frequency g - modes , where buoyancy is the restoring force .",
    "there are also intermediate oscillations sometimes called f - modes @xcite .",
    "the boundedness of any system usually leads to oscillation in the first eigenfrequency which is also called the fundamental frequency of the system .",
    "the mechanical analog of the fundamental oscillation is the tuning fork in the case of an impulsive force and the musical trumpet in the case of a continuous force .",
    "the oscillation of a star in the fundamental mode yields a wavelength comparable with the stellar radius .",
    "therefore the fundamental frequency evaluated for an homogeneous self - gravitating sphere will be of order of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the radius and the mass of star and @xmath16 is the mean sound speed in the interior .",
    "however the real equilibrium density is not uniform throughout the sun , therefore the fundamental period is shorter @xmath0 1 hour .",
    "unfortunately no clear observational evidence of the fundamental pulsation was found , which is probably due to the acoustic cutoff in the stratified atmosphere .",
    "the acoustic cutoff frequency in an isothermal atmosphere is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is pressure scale height . under conditions of the photosphere / chromosphere @xmath19 km .",
    "then for the typical photospheric sound speed @xmath20 km / s the cutoff frequency is 0.03 s@xmath21 , which gives the cutoff period of 210 s. this means that the sound waves with longer periods , such as the fundamental radial pressure mode , can not pass through the photosphere .",
    "probably this is a reason why the low - frequency pressure modes are not seen in oscillation spectrum ( but see a possible evidence of low frequency pulsation in @xcite ) .    as spherical coordinates lead to a more complicated mathematical formalism",
    ", we adopt a cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath22 , @xmath10 , @xmath23 ) and for simplicity consider only the axisymmetric problem so everywhere @xmath24 is assumed .",
    "we suppose that an uniform poloidal magnetic field , @xmath25 , exists inside the star directed along the @xmath23 axis ( see fig.1 ) . the large - scale magnetic field is generated either by classical dynamo or other mechanisms , but this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we just assume that the magnetic field exists .",
    "this field is considered to be relatively weak , so it does not affect the fundamental pulsation significantly .    in the adopted cylindrical coordinate system",
    ", we approximate the fundamental solar oscillation as a radial pulsation of the cylinder , thus neglect the motion along the @xmath23 axis . then the linearised equations ( 1)-(5 )",
    "can be split into radial and azimuthal components , where the radial component corresponds to pulsations and the azimuthal component to torsional alfvn waves .",
    "torsional alfvn waves have azimuthal velocity polarisation and propagate along the @xmath23 axis .",
    "as we will see later , the wavelength of the alfvn waves is much smaller as compared to the solar radius ( due to small alfvn speed in the interior ) , therefere the @xmath23 velocity component of the global pulsation , which has a spatial scale comparable to the solar radius , can be considered as homogeneous in alfvn spatial scale and therefore can not significantly affect the alfvn wave dynamics .",
    "therefore , the motion along the @xmath23 axis due to the global pulsation may only complicate the calculations and thus is neglected as mentioned above .",
    "the radial part of linearised equations ( 1)-(5 ) in cylindrical coordinates is    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28 - {",
    "\\delta { \\rho}}{{{\\partial { { \\phi}}}}\\over { \\partial r } } } , \\ ] ]    @xmath29    while the azimuthal part is @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the velocity , magnetic field , density and pressure perturbations respectively .",
    "equations ( 6)-(9 ) govern the linear radial pulsation of the star , while equations ( 10)-(11 ) describe the linear torsional alfvn waves .    in general",
    ", stellar radial adiabatic pulsations can be represented as standing spherical waves @xcite with a linear radial velocity field @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the eigenfrequency , @xmath36 is the eigenfunction and @xmath12 is the pulsation amplitude .",
    "the expression of the eigenfunction @xmath36 depends on the spatial profiles of the unperturbed physical quantities and may be represented by some combination of spherical bessel functions .",
    "however , here we are not interested in specific pulsation functional forms , therefore we retain its general form @xmath36 , which then may be specified by choosing the spatial distribution of the unperturbed quantities throughout the sun .",
    "then , using expression ( 12 ) , the linearised continuity and induction equations give the density and magnetic field perturbations as : @xmath37 @xmath38 where@xmath39@xmath40 where @xmath41 is the unperturbed density .",
    "equations ( 13)-(14 ) show that the radial pulsation leads to local periodical variation of density and magnetic field throughout the sun , which causes the periodical variation of the alfvn speed at each level @xmath22 . in next section",
    "we show that it determines an exponential amplification of torsional alfvn waves with half the frequency of pulsation .",
    "the radial pulsation affects the torsional alfvn waves through nonlinear interaction and then equations ( 10)-(11 ) can be rewritten as @xmath42 @xmath43    thus equations ( 17)-(18 ) describe the evolution of alfvn waves in presence of the global pulsation .",
    "since the energy associated to this pulsation is clearly much larger than the energy stored in alfvn waves , the back reaction of alfvn waves can be ignored ( at least at the initial phase of the wave evolution ) , which means that the amplitude of the pulsation remains constant .",
    "equations ( 17)-(18 ) can be further simplified by taking the alfvn oscillations in narrow cylindrical shells , then the unperturbed density @xmath44 and magnetic field @xmath25 can be considered as homogeneous ( thus @xmath22 will stand as a parameter in the equations ) and equations ( 13)-(14 ) give    @xmath45    then equations ( 17)-(18 ) lead to the second order differential equation @xmath46{{\\partial u_{\\phi}}\\over { \\partial t } } - \\left [ { { b_0(b_0 + b_z)}\\over { 4\\pi{\\rho_0}}}{{\\partial^2 u_{\\phi}}\\over { \\partial z^2 } } - { { u_{\\phi}}\\over { r}}{{\\partial u_r}\\over { \\partial t } } \\right ] = \\ ] ] @xmath47    using the fourier transform of @xmath48 with @xmath23-dependence @xmath49 equation ( 20 ) is rewritten as    @xmath50{{\\partial { \\hat u}_{\\phi}}\\over { \\partial t } } + \\left [ { { b_0(b_0 + b_z)}\\over { 4\\pi{\\rho_0}}}k^2_z + { { 1}\\over { r}}{{\\partial u_r}\\over { \\partial t } } \\right ] { \\hat u}_{\\phi}=\\ ] ] @xmath47    now , using the well known substitution of function @xmath51 the term with the first time derivative can be removed and with expressions ( 12)-(14 ) we finally get @xmath52{\\tilde u}_{\\phi}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath53{{\\partial u_r}\\over { \\partial r } } + \\left [ v^2_ak^2_z + { { \\omega^2_n}\\over 2 } \\right ] { { u_r}\\over r } .\\ ] ] without the pulsation ( i.e. taking @xmath12=0 ) , equation ( 24 ) describes the usual dispersion relation of alfvn waves .",
    "but , in presence of the forcing introduced by the pulsation ( @xmath54 ) , equation ( 24 ) is the well known mathieu equation .",
    "the solution of this equation with frequency @xmath55 has an exponentially growing character @xcite , thus the main resonant solution occurs when @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the frequency of torsional alfvn waves . under condition ( 26 ) the solution of equation ( 24 ) is @xmath58,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and the phase sign depends on @xmath60 ; it is @xmath61 for negative @xmath60 and @xmath62 for positive @xmath60 .",
    "note that the solution has a resonant character within the frequency interval    @xmath63    thus the radial pulsation leads to an exponential amplification of torsional alfvn waves with the half frequency @xmath64 .",
    "the growth rate depends on the amplitude @xmath12 and spatial structure of the pulsation eigenfunction @xmath36 , which in turn depends on the radial structure of density @xmath44 and magnetic field @xmath25 .",
    "the resonant condition ( 26 ) imposes a restriction on the wave number @xmath65 . in other words ,",
    "the pulsation `` picks up '' the harmonics of torsional alfvn waves with a certain wavelength at each radial distance @xmath22 .",
    "numerical simulation of equations ( 17)-(18 ) also shows the resonant amplification of torsional alfvn waves . for simplicity",
    "we take the function @xmath66 in expression ( 12 ) as constant and look for the temporal evolution of the spatial fourier harmonics of @xmath67 and @xmath48 .",
    "the results are shown on fig .",
    "the exponential amplification of the alfvn wave spatial fourier harmonics ( upper plots ) with the double period of pulsation is clearly seen .        as the main resonance occurs at the half frequency of pulsation ( see equation ( 26 ) )",
    ", the resonant alfvn waves in the solar interior will have a period @xmath68 where @xmath69 hour is the pulsation period .",
    "due to the resonant range ( 28 ) , the generated alfvn waves will have not a fixed period , but many periods in that range .",
    "the width of range depends on the amplitude of pulsation .",
    "thus the period of generated alfvn waves in the solar interior may be in the range of @xmath70    from expression ( 26 ) we may calculate the wavelength of the generated alfvn waves . using the dispersion relation of the sound waves",
    ", we have @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the wavelength of the resonant alfvn waves and @xmath73 is the mean alfvn speed in the interior . as the plasma @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) is higher in the solar interior",
    ", the wavelength of the alfvn waves will be shorter comparing to the solar radius .",
    "taking @xmath76 , we get a value of this wavelength in the solar interior such as @xmath77 .",
    "it must be mentioned that the amplification of the alfvn waves due to the fundamental pulsation can occur in the solar interior below the convection zone , as the motions in the convection zone may destroy the resonance process .",
    "the amplified alfvn waves can propagate along the magnetic field lines through the convection zone and reach the solar atmosphere ( see the schematic picture in fig .",
    "the configuration of large - scale magnetic field is very simplified as the complication due to the convection is completely ignored .",
    "in fact the stochastic small scale magnetic fields in the convection zone may make the wave propagation difficult .",
    "but the magnetic fields in sunspots and in regions between large convective cells are predominantly large scale and they may easily guide the waves through the convection zone . therefore the alfvn waves probably can be observed in sunspot latitudes and in polar regions where the dipole component of magnetic field dominates .",
    "it is an interesting fact that observed low - frequency oscillations found in photosphere , chromosphere and prominence by @xcite have the period of @xmath78 hours at sunspot ( 25@xmath79 - 30@xmath79 ) and higher ( 60@xmath79 ) latitudes .",
    "the observed oscillations are rather transversal than the radial and can be associated to the alfvn waves propagating from the solar interior .",
    "also long - period transversal oscillations with the period of @xmath80 hours have been observed in chromospheric spectral lines @xcite and again can be interpreted as alfvn waves .",
    "the long - period oscillations recently observed in solar prominence @xcite can be also due to the alfvn waves propagating from below .",
    "it is also intriguing fact that long - period alfvn waves are observed in fast solar wind at high latitudes where dipolar magnetic field component is dominant @xcite .",
    "it is quiet possible that photospheric and chromospheric alfvn waves may propagate into the corona and solar wind .",
    "the amplitude of long - period oscillations @xcite in the photosphere is @xmath81 km / s and in the chromosphere @xmath82 km / s .",
    "if these oscillations propagate into the low density corona then the amplitudes must be increased as the wave energy density remains approximately constant .",
    "the wave energy density is of order @xmath83 , where @xmath6 is the background density and @xmath84 is the wave velocity .",
    "the particle density in the photosphere is 10@xmath85 times more than in the corona .",
    "thus in order to retain the constant energy density , the wave velocity must increase 10@xmath86 times",
    "i.e. to the value @xmath87 km / s . which means that the waves become intrinsically non - linear as the alfvn speed has the similar value in the corona .",
    "it is the fact that solar wind alfvn waves are nonlinear @xmath88 .",
    "another question is the energy balance between solar global modes and observed alfvn waves .",
    "the energy stored in the fundamental pulsation is huge as the whole sun takes part in the oscillation .",
    "also the ratio between the densities in the interior ( say the base of convection zone ) and the photosphere is @xmath89 .",
    "therefore even low amplitude pulsation can be responsible for observed alfvn wave energy .",
    "on another hand , as we mentioned above there is no clear observational evidence of solar global pulsation .",
    "@xcite reported the variation of solar diameter with the periods around 1 hour .",
    "but since the pulsation was not clearly observed in solar oscillation spectrum . there can be two main reasons why the fundamental pressure mode is absent at the photosphere .",
    "either it has very low amplitude or it can not pass the photosphere due to the stratification cutoff ( see above ) . on another hand , the continuous energy transfer from the pulsation into the alfvn waves in the interior may significantly lower the amplitude of pulsation at the surface .    as the mean alfvn speed varies from the solar interior to the corona",
    ", the wavelength and the period of these upwards propagating alfvn waves will change along their way to the corona .",
    "therefore the observed alfvn oscillations in the solar wind will have a longer wavelength than the alfvn waves in the interior .",
    "it must be mentioned that many simplifications ( such as the cylindrical symmetry instead of the spherical one , the spatially homogeneous distribution of physical quantities ) have been made to outline the physics of the alfvn wave generation in a simple way .",
    "of course , the real situation is much more complicated , but the physical meaning of the mechanism will remain the same .",
    "future exstensive numerical simulation is needed in order to take into account the real distribution of physical quantities , but this is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "we suggest that outwardly propagating long - period alfvn waves , which have been observed in solar polar regions by _ ulysses _ @xcite can be generated in the solar interior due to the solar fundamental radial pulsation .",
    "it is shown that this radial pulsation parametrically amplifies torsional alfvn waves .",
    "the main resonance occurs for alfvn waves with the double period of pulsation , although the process has a resonant range of frequencies , whose width depends on the amplitude of pulsation .",
    "therefore the solar fundamental radial pulsation , with a period of @xmath0 1 hours , will amplify alfvn waves with a period of @xmath0 1.5 - 3 hours .",
    "these amplified alfvn waves may propagate upwards to the solar corona and cause the observed magnetic field and velocity oscillations in the solar wind .",
    "it must be mentioned that low - frequency g - modes may also amplify alfvn waves with longer periods , but we do not consider this process in this letter .",
    "however it is really worth to study the process in future , as the existence of g - modes in the solar interior could be revealed through alfvn oscillations in the photosphere / chromosphere and solar wind .",
