    "the coulomb system in arbitrary dimensions is among the well - known and best studied exactly solvable systems in quantum mechanics@xcite-@xcite .",
    "it describes the dynamics of charged particles under the influence of the @xmath3  potential .",
    "this is what we conventionally mean by coulomb system , even if the true @xmath0-dimensional coulomb potential satisfying the poisson equation goes like @xmath4 , for @xmath5 .",
    "it has been shown that the bound and scattering states of a coulomb system in @xmath0  dimensions can be associated with the rotation group @xmath6  and the lorentz group @xmath7  respectively@xcite-@xcite . in other words , for a fixed energy , these groups appear as invariance groups of the system .",
    "these symmetries for @xmath8  were discovered by fock@xcite and bargmann@xcite .",
    "moreover , it was pointed out in ref.@xcite that the dynamical group that yields the positive and negative energy spectra of the coulomb problem in @xmath0dimensions is @xmath9 ,  while the dynamical group in the case @xmath8  had been discussed by barut@xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that coulomb and harmonic - oscillator systems are the only spherically symmetric superintegrable systems in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we recall that in classical mechanics a closed system with @xmath0  degrees of freedom is completely integrable if it admits @xmath0  integrals of motion ( including the hamiltonian ) that are independent and in involution , i.e. the poisson brackets of any two integrals are zero .",
    "the system is called superintegrable if there exist @xmath10 , @xmath11 , additional independent integrals of motion .",
    "the cases @xmath12  and @xmath13  correspond to minimal and maximal superintegrability , respectively . in quantum mechanics the definitions of complete integrability and superintegrability are same , but poisson brackets are replaced by commutators ( see ref.@xcite for a general review ) .    in the present work we shall consider a quantum system characterized by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath14    we shall call the system governed by the hamiltonian given above the coulomb - rosochatius@xcite system.the motion is confined to the region bounded by the singularity of @xmath15  at hyper - planes @xmath16  ,  i.e. hyper - octant ( one of the @xmath17  regions of euclidean space @xmath18 ) . without loss of generality",
    "this can be taken to be the non - negative hyper - octant ( i.e. where @xmath19  ) .",
    "the main interest of the coulomb - rosochatius system consists in its maximal superintegrability , recently proved for @xmath8  in the classical caseve08 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the system had been proved long ago ma67,@xcite to be quasi - maximally superintegrable for @xmath20 , i.e. to admit @xmath21  operators quadratic in the momenta . for @xmath8 , the fifth integral of motion quartic in the momenta",
    "was explicitly worked out in refs@xcite-@xcite , thus proving the maximal superintegrability of the classical coulomb - rosochatius system .",
    "finally , the maximal superintegrability of the classical system ( [ v_cr ] ) in @xmath0-dimensional spherical , hyperbolic and euclidean spaces was proved in ref.@xcite : here again , one of the @xmath2  functionally independent integrals of motion turns out to be quartic in the momenta , while the remaining ones are quadratic .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is the complete algebraic solution of bound states and scattering states of the quantum - mechanical coulomb - rosochatius system in @xmath0 dimensions and the derivation of the @xmath2 integrals of motion expected for maximal superintegrability .    before describing the method of solution of the quantum coulomb - rosochatius system in @xmath0 dimensions , a few definitions are in order :",
    "a lie group @xmath22 is an invariance group for a quantum - mechanical system with hamiltonian @xmath15 if the latter can be related to a suitable function of a casimir operator , @xmath23 , of the group , @xmath22 @xmath24 an algebraic derivation of the energy spectrum is possible also when @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a subspace of the carrier space . in this case",
    "the group @xmath22  describes the same energy states of a family of hamiltonians @xmath15with different potential strength .",
    "this is why @xmath22  is called potential group @xcite .",
    "such an approach was proposed by ghirardi @xcite , who  worked it out in detail for the scarf potential  @xcite .",
    "it is similar to the approach of olshanetsky and perelomov @xcite , where quantum integrable systems are related to the radial part of the laplace operator on homogeneous spaces , i.e@xmath27  to the radial part of a second - order casimir operator of a lie group .",
    "moreover , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath1 matrix  can be associated with an intertwining operator , @xmath28 , between two weyl - equivalent representations , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , of @xmath22 , _",
    "i.e. _ two representations with the same casimir eigenvalues .    by definition",
    ", @xmath28 satisfies the following equations @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the corresponding representations of the algebra , @xmath35 , of @xmath22 .",
    "( [ intertw_1]-[intertw_2 ] ) have high restrictive power , determining the intertwining operator up to a constant .",
    "the @xmath1 matrix coincides with the intertwining operator @xmath28@xmath36 if eq .",
    "( [ inv_group ] ) holds , and with the reduction of @xmath28 to a proper hilbert subspace @xmath26@xmath37 if eq .",
    "( [ pot_group ] ) holds .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : section 2 will describe in full detail the potential group for the coulomb - rosochatius system , with a potential specialized to @xmath38 with subsection 2.1 dedicated to the derivation of bound states and subsection 2.2 to scattering states .",
    "finally , section 3 will be devoted to conclusions and perspectives .",
    "it is well known that the group @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) has a class of unitary irreducible representations ( uir s ) characterized by a number @xmath41  ( @xmath42 ) in which the basis vectors are completely labelled by @xmath43numbers only .",
    "this representation can be realized in the hilbert space spanned by negative - energy ( positive - energy ) states corresponding to a fixed eigenvalue of the coulomb hamiltonian in @xmath44 dimensions . according to this ,",
    "one introduces the angular momentum operators @xmath45 and the @xmath44-dimensional runge - lenz vector @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",

    "at this stage we note that , in  general , one can define the generators of @xmath69 ( @xmath62 ) ( let us call them @xmath70 ) , as follows @xmath71 where @xmath72 is some non - negative function of @xmath73 .",
    "now the generators @xmath74 act in the eigenspace @xmath75  of @xmath76  equipped with the scalar product @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a quasi - invariant measure on  @xmath79 . the representations acting in @xmath80 and @xmath75 are , of course , unitarily equivalent .",
    "the unitary mapping @xmath81 which realizes the equivalence is given by @xmath82    although these representations are equivalent from the mathematical view - point , they may be related to different physical problems .",
    "we shall prove that the bound states and scattering states of the quantum system ( non_centr_v2 ) are related to the representation of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , acting in the hilbert space with scalar product @xmath85where @xmath86 .  to this end , we choose @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
