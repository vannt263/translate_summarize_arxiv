    "suppose that an area is being monitored by a number of sensors which transmit their observations to a central location , that we will call fusion center . at some unknown time ,",
    "an abrupt disorder occurs , such as an unexpected intrusion , and changes the dynamics of the observed processes in all sensors simultaneously .",
    "the goal is to raise an alarm at the fusion center as soon as possible after the occurrence of the change . when the sensors transmit their complete observations to the fusion center ,",
    "this is the classical problem of sequential change detection , for exhaustive reviews on which we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , classical detection rules typically are not applicable in modern application areas , such as mobile and wireless communications and distributed surveillance systems . in such systems ,",
    "the sensors are typically low - power devices whose links with the fusion center are characterized by limited communication bandwidth @xcite,@xcite .",
    "thus , in order to preserve the robustness of the network , it is necessary to limit the overall communication load and , in particular , the transmission activity of each sensor .",
    "this primarily implies a _ quantization _ constraint , i.e. , each sensor should transmit a small number of bits each time it communicates with the fusion center , but also a _ rate _ constraint ,",
    "i.e. , each sensor should communicate with the fusion center at a lower rate than its sampling rate . as a result , before constructing a sequential detection rule at the fusion center , the designer must first decide what kind of information should be transmitted from the sensors , taking into account the above communication constraints . in what follows , we will call detection rules that respect such constraints _ decentralized _ , in contrast to the _ centralized _ ones that require knowledge of the full sensor observations .    most papers in the decentralized literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) assume that each sensor transmits a quantized version of _ every _ observation it takes , i.e. , the communication rate is equal to the sampling rate . for a discussion on one - shot schemes , where each sensor transmits to the fusion center a single bit _ at most once _ , we refer to @xcite . a decentralized detection rule which enjoys an asymptotic optimality property",
    "was proposed by mei @xcite , however the performance of this scheme in practice is often worse than that of asymptotically suboptimal detection rules .",
    "thus , it has been an open problem to find an asymptotically optimal decentralized detection rule that is also efficient in practice .",
    "the main contribution of this work is that we propose such a rule .",
    "specifically , we suggest that each sensor communicates with the fusion center at stopping times of its local filtration ; at every communication , it transmits a _ low - bit _ message which `` summarizes '' the evolution of its local sufficient statistic since the previous communication ; the fusion center , in parallel , runs a cusum test on the transmitted messages in order to detect the change . for similar communication schemes in the context of decentralized sequential hypothesis testing we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the design and analysis of the proposed scheme , that we call d - cusum , is different in discrete and continuous time .",
    "however , in both cases we establish a _ second - order _ asymptotic optimality property , that is stronger than the first - order asymptotic optimality of the detection rule in @xcite . in particular , we show that the performance loss of d - cusum with respect to the optimal centralized cusum remains bounded as the period of false alarms goes to infinity .",
    "moreover , we show that d - cusum remains first - order asymptotically optimal even when it induces an asymptotically low communication rate and there is an asymptotically large number of sensors .",
    "simulation experiments suggest that these strong theoretical properties are also accompanied by very good performance in practice and that d - cusum is much more efficient than a similar , cusum - based decentralized detection rule that relies on communication from the sensors at deterministic times .    in what follows , in section 2",
    ", we formulate the problem of ( decentralized ) sequential change detection and describe the main decentralized schemes in the literature . in section 3 ,",
    "we define and analyze the proposed scheme both in continuous and in discrete time . in section 4",
    ", we summarize and discuss an extension in the case of correlated sensors .",
    "the proof of all results , as well as some supporting lemmas , are presented in appendices a - e .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath1-dimensional stochastic process , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the observed process at sensor @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the local filtration at sensor @xmath4 and by @xmath7 the global filtration , i.e. , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "time may be either discrete @xmath10 or continuous @xmath11 and in the latter case all filtrations are considered to be right - continuous .",
    "we assume that at some unknown , deterministic time @xmath12 , the distribution of @xmath13 , which we denote by @xmath14 , changes from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , where @xmath16 and @xmath15 are two completely specified , locally equivalent probability measures on the canonical space of @xmath13 .",
    "in other words , @xmath14 coincides with @xmath15 when both measures are restricted to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , whereas for @xmath19 we can define the following log - likelihood ratio process @xmath20      in the centralized setup , where the fusion center has access to all sensor observations , the problem is to find an @xmath7-stopping time @xmath21 that has small detection delay and rare false alarms , i.e. , @xmath21 should take large values under @xmath15 and @xmath22 small values under @xmath23 .",
    "there are different approaches in how to quantify detection delay and false alarms , such as the bayesian formulation due to shiryaev @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or the minimax formulation due to pollak @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the formulation suggested by lorden @xcite , where the performance of a detection rule @xmath21 is measured by its worst - case ( with respect to @xmath24 ) conditional expected delay given the worst possible history of observations up to @xmath24 , @xmath25 =   \\sup_{\\tau \\geq 0 } \\",
    ", \\text{ess\\,sup } \\ ; { \\mathsf{e}}_{\\tau } [   ( { \\mathcal{t}}-\\tau)^{+ }    | { \\mathscr{f}}_{\\tau } ] , \\ ] ] and an optimal detection rule is a solution to the following optimization problem @xmath26 ~ \\text{when } ~   { \\mathsf{e}}_{\\infty } [ { \\mathcal{t } } ] \\geq \\gamma , \\ ] ] where @xmath27 . in other words ,",
    "the goal in this approach is to minimize the detection delay under the worst - case scenario with respect to both the changepoint and the history of observations before the change , while controlling the period of false alarms above a desired level , @xmath28 .",
    "it is well known ( see @xcite , @xcite ) that when @xmath29 is a random walk , the solution to this problem is given by page s @xcite cumulative sums ( cusum ) test , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is defined so that the false alarm constraint in ( [ lord_crit ] ) be satisfied with equality , i.e. , @xmath32=\\gamma$ ] .",
    "this exact ( i.e. , non - asymptotic ) optimality of the cusum test can be extended to a much richer class of dynamics if we adopt an idea of liptser and shiryaev @xcite and measure detection delay and period of false alarms not in terms of actual time , but in terms of kullback - leibler divergence .",

    ", \\text{ess\\,sup } \\ ; { \\mathsf{e}}_{\\tau } [ ( u_{{\\mathcal{t}}}-   u _ { \\tau } ) { \\mathbbm{1}_{\\{{\\mathcal{t}}>\\tau\\ } } } | { \\mathscr{f}}_{\\tau } ] \\ ] ] and define an optimal detection rule as a solution to @xmath35 ~ \\text{when } ~   { \\mathsf{e}}_{\\infty } [ -u_{{\\mathcal{t } } } ] \\geq \\gamma,\\ ] ] a problem that is equivalent to when @xmath36 is a random walk .",
    "however , it has been shown in @xcite , @xcite that the cusum test , with threshold @xmath31 chosen so that @xmath37 = \\gamma$ ] , also solves problem whenever @xmath36 has continuous paths and @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the quadratic variation of @xmath40 .",
    "the latter optimality result implies that cusum solves lorden s original problem ( [ lord_crit ] ) whenever @xmath36 has continuous paths and @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "this is the case , for example , when each @xmath3 is a fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) with hurst index @xmath43 before the change and adopts a polynomial drift term with exponent @xmath44 after the change @xcite .",
    "in the special case that @xmath45 , this implies the well - known optimality of cusum for detecting a constant drift in a brownian motion , established by shiryaev @xcite and beibel @xcite .      centralized ( classical ) detection rules as the cusum test can not be applied in a decentralized setup , where communication constraints must be taken into account . in this context , before defining a detection rule at the fusion center , we must first specify a _ communication scheme _ , that will determine the information that will be transmitted from the sensors to the fusion center .",
    "therefore , we define a _",
    "decentralized _ sequential detection rule as a pair @xmath46 , where @xmath21 is an @xmath47-stopping time and @xmath47 is a filtration of the form @xmath48 where each @xmath49 is the sequence of communication times for sensor @xmath4 and @xmath50 is the message transmitted to the fusion center at time @xmath51 .",
    "each @xmath52 must be an @xmath53-stopping time and each @xmath50 an @xmath54-measurable random variable that takes values in a _",
    "finite _ set , so that a small number of bits is required for its transmission to the fusion center .",
    "moreover , since many applications are characterized by limited storage capacity , we require additionally that each @xmath55 is measurable with respect to @xmath56 , the @xmath57-algebra generated by the observations at sensor @xmath4 between its @xmath58 and @xmath59 transmission . note",
    "that this framework forbids communication between sensors or feedback from the fusion center to the sensors .",
    "such possibilities impose a much heavier communication load on the network and raise questions regarding the design of the network architecture , which we do not consider here .",
    "for decentralized detection rules that require feedback we refer to @xcite .",
    "ideally , we would like to find the best possible decentralized detection rule , performing a joint optimization over the communication scheme at the sensors and the detection rule at the fusion center .",
    "such an optimization problem is highly intractable , even if one makes a number of simplifying assumptions @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we will use the centralized cusum as the ultimate benchmark and compare any decentralized detection rule against it .",
    "we can only hope that such a detection rule attains the optimal centralized performance asymptotically .",
    "thus , if @xmath60 is an arbitrary decentralized detection rule and @xmath61 the centralized cusum test so that @xmath62\\ge\\gamma= { \\mathsf{e}}_{\\infty}[-u_{{\\mathcal{s}}}]$ ] for any @xmath27 , we will say that @xmath21 is asymptotically optimal of _ first _ order if @xmath63/{\\mathcal{j}}[{\\mathcal{s } } ] \\rightarrow 1 $ ] as @xmath64 and of _ second _ order if @xmath63 - { \\mathcal{j}}[{\\mathcal{s } } ] = { \\mathcal{o}}(1)$ ] as @xmath65 .",
    "clearly , since @xmath66 \\rightarrow \\infty$ ] as @xmath64 , second order asymptotic optimality is a stronger property , which guarantees that the inflicted performance loss remains bounded as the rate of false alarms goes to 0 .",
    "as it is common in the literature of decentralized sequential detection , we will assume that observations from different sensors are independent .",
    "thus , if @xmath67 is the distribution of @xmath3 , then @xmath68 for any @xmath69 $ ] and , consequently , @xmath70 for any @xmath71 .",
    "we also assume that the local kullback - leibler ( kl ) information numbers , @xmath72 $ ] and @xmath73 $ ] , are positive and finite for every @xmath74 and , furthermore , we define the corresponding average kl - numbers @xmath75= \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{k=1}^{k } i_{0}^k \\quad   \\text{and } \\quad   \\bar{i}_{\\infty}:= \\frac{1}{k}{\\mathsf{e}}_{\\infty}[-u_{1}]=\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{k=1}^{k } i_{\\infty}^k.\\ ] ] in the remainder of this section , we describe the main decentralized sequential detection rules in the literature , embedding them in the above framework .",
    "we classify them into two categories ; in the first , the sensors transmit systematically compressed versions of their data to the fusion center and the latter combines the received messages in order to detect the change ; in the second , each sensor detects individually the change and the fusion center combines the local sensor decisions .",
    "suppose that each sensor transmits to the fusion center quantized versions of its local log - likelihood ratio process at deterministic , equidistant times .",
    "specifically , if for each sensor the communication period is @xmath76 and the available alphabet @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is an integer , then @xmath79 where @xmath80 are fixed thresholds .",
    "this communication scheme induces synchronous communication to the fusion center , which receives at each time @xmath81 the @xmath1-dimensional vector @xmath82 .",
    "if we additionally assume that each @xmath83 has stationary and independent increments , then a natural detection rule at the fusion center is the corresponding cusum stopping time @xmath84 where the threshold @xmath85 is chosen so that the false alarm constraint be satisfied with equality and the cusum statistic @xmath86 admits the following recursion : @xmath87 , ~ \\hat{y}_{0}:=0 , \\label{eq : cus1}\\ ] ] note that we have to multiply by @xmath76 in in order to return to physical time units , since the samples are acquired with a rate @xmath88 .",
    "we call this detection scheme q - cusum , where q stands for the `` quantization '' employed by this method . this detection rule has been studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in the case that the sensors take i.i.d . observations and",
    "each sensor communicates with the fusion center at _ every _ observation time ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that as @xmath64 @xmath90}{{\\mathcal{j}}[{\\mathcal{s } } ] } \\rightarrow \\frac{r \\bar{i}_{0}}{\\hat{i}_{0 } } , \\quad \\text{where } \\ ;   \\hat{i}_{0}:= \\frac{1}{k } \\sum_{i=1}^{k } \\sum_{j=1}^{b }   { \\mathsf{p}}_{0}(z_{n}^k = j)\\log \\frac { { \\mathsf{p}}_{0}(z_{n}^k = j)}{{\\mathsf{p}}_{\\infty}(z_{n}^k = j ) } , \\ ] ] and @xmath91 is the average kl - number defined in ( [ klaver ] ) , which implies that the asymptotic performance of @xmath92 is optimized by selecting thresholds @xmath93 in order to maximize @xmath94 .",
    "however , for any choice of thresholds , @xmath92 is not ( even first - order ) asymptotically optimal , since @xmath95 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "suppose now that each sensor @xmath4 communicates at the following times @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the local cusum statistic and @xmath98 is a fixed , positive threshold . in this way , the sensors communicate with the fusion center only to announce they have detected the change .",
    "this requires only _ one - bit _ transmissions , which means that even if the network supports the transmission of multi - bit messages , this flexibility is not going to be useful .",
    "there are many reasonable fusion center policies that can be based on ( [ meitau ] ) .",
    "for example , the fusion center may raise an alarm the first time any sensor communicates , i.e. , at @xmath99 ( min - cusum ) .",
    "this is clearly a one - shot scheme , i.e. , it requires transmission of at most one bit from each sensor , and as one would expect it is asymptotically suboptimal ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the case of i.i.d . observations and @xcite for the case of brownian motions ) .",
    "an alternative possibility is to raise an alarm the first time that all sensors communicate _",
    "simultaneously _ ,",
    "i.e. , at @xmath100 this rule was suggested ( although in a different form ) by mei @xcite , where it was shown that when each @xmath101 is a random walk with a finite second moment , @xmath102 is first - order asymptotically optimal ( in particular , @xmath103- { \\mathcal{j}}[{\\mathcal{s}}]= { \\mathcal{o}}(\\sqrt{\\log \\gamma})$ ] ) , as long as each @xmath98 is proportional to the local kl - number , @xmath104 .",
    "since the constant of proportionality is determined by @xmath28 , this means that for this decentralized scheme , contrary to q - cusum , it is not possible to control how often each sensor communicates with the fusion center .",
    "however , by construction , the induced communication activity will be intense only after the change has occurred ; before the change , a sensor communicates only to report a `` local false alarm '' , which is a rare event . finally , despite its asymptotic optimality",
    ", it is known ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) that the non - asymptotic performance of @xmath102 can be worse than that of q - cusum when the latter requires transmission of one - bit messages ( @xmath105 ) at every observation time ( @xmath89 ) , especially when @xmath1 is large .",
    "in this section , we define and analyze the decentralized detection structure that we propose .",
    "thus , we suggest that each sensor @xmath4 communicates with the fusion center at the following sequence of @xmath53-stopping times @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are fixed , positive thresholds . for every @xmath109 and @xmath110 we set @xmath111 i.e. , @xmath112 is the number of messages that have been transmitted by sensor @xmath4 up to time @xmath42 , @xmath113 is the most recent communication time for sensor @xmath4 at time @xmath42 and @xmath114 is the accumulated log - likelihood ratio at sensor @xmath4 in the time - interval @xmath115 $ ] .    at time @xmath116",
    ", we suggest that sensor @xmath4 transmits to the fusion center the following message @xmath117 where @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 are fixed , positive threshold and @xmath121 a positive integer .",
    "we will also use the following notation @xmath122 which allows us to rewrite ( [ zcdmany ] ) as follows @xmath123 when @xmath124 , @xmath55 is a one - bit message of the form @xmath125 that simply informs the fusion center whether @xmath126 or @xmath127 .",
    "when @xmath128 , @xmath55 requires the transmission of @xmath129 bits and the fusion center also obtains information regarding the size of the overshoot .",
    "the stopping times ( [ taucd ] ) and the messages ( [ zcdmany ] ) determine the flow of information ( [ flow ] ) at the fusion center . assuming that the fusion center uses this information and approximates each local log - likelihood ratio @xmath130 by some statistic @xmath131 , we suggest the following detection rule @xmath132 and threshold @xmath133 is defined so that @xmath134=\\gamma$ ] .",
    "the appropriate selection for @xmath135 , as well as the design and analysis of the resulting detection rule , is different in discrete and continuous time and , for this reason , we will treat these two setups separately .",

    "the fusion center is able to recover the value of @xmath140 at any time @xmath52 , since @xmath141 , and a natural approximation for @xmath142 at some arbitrary time @xmath42 is the corresponding most recently reproduced value , i.e. , @xmath143    the proposed scheme has a number of practical advantages .",
    "first of all , the fusion statistic @xmath144 is piecewise - constant and its value needs to be updated only at communication times , according to the following convenient formula : @xmath145 compare this with the centralized , continuous - time cusum statistic , @xmath146 , which does not in general admit such a recursion and whose calculation at the fusion center requires high - frequency transmission of `` infinite - bit '' messages from the sensors .    moreover , it is possible to control the communication rate of sensor @xmath4 by selecting appropriately @xmath138 and @xmath147 .",

    "we should emphasize that in the case of a binary alphabet ( @xmath124 ) , where @xmath267 is bounded away from 0 ( i.e. , @xmath268 ) , first - order asymptotic optimality can not be achieved with a fixed rate of communication , i.e. , when @xmath254 as @xmath64 .",

    "quantizing the overshoots is like quantizing a random variable with ( almost ) fixed statistics .",
    "consequently , the mean square quantization error , or any other similar quality measure , will be ( almost ) independent from @xmath234 for fixed number of bits .    on the contrary , for the classical quantization scheme , employed by q - cusum",
    ", quantization is applied on the value of each @xmath270 , where @xmath76 denotes the fixed corresponding period .",
    "it is very simple to realize that for fixed number of bits , if we increase the period @xmath76 , the mean square quantization error will _ increase _ , since the difference @xmath270 will involve a larger sum of i.i.d .",
    "random variables .",
    "this becomes particularly obvious when these random variables are bounded , in which case the support of the sum increases linearly with @xmath76 and we are asked , with the same number of bits , to quantize a larger range of values .",
    "this suggests that if we want to communicate with the fusion center at a smaller rate and preserve the same number of bits , this will inflict larger quantization errors and therefore additional performance degradation for q - cusum . as we mentioned above , this is not the case with the quantization scheme we adopt for d - cusum , since increasing @xmath234 ( to reduce the communication rate ) leaves the mean square quantization error almost intact .",
    "let us now illustrate these conclusions with a simulation study .",
    "specifically , suppose that each sensor @xmath4 takes independent , normally distributed observations with variance @xmath271 and mean that changes from @xmath272 to @xmath273 , i.e. , @xmath274 when @xmath18 and @xmath275 when @xmath276 .",
    "then , for every @xmath277 we have @xmath278 .",

    "note that such a fair comparison is not possible with decentralized rules that do not explicitly control their transmission rate . of course , the ultimate benchmark is the centralized cusum test , which requires transmission of the observation of each sensor at every time @xmath42 .",

    "this is exactly the _ second - order _ asymptotic optimality that we established theoretically . on the contrary ,",
    "the operating characteristic curve of q - cusum @xmath92 diverges as @xmath28 increases , as expected , since this not an asymptotically optimal scheme ( even of first order ) .    of course ,",
    "when an `` infinite - bit '' message is transmitted at each communication time , q - cusum corresponds to the centralized cusum with period @xmath76 and its operating characteristic curve is parallel to the optimal one .",
    "however , what is really interesting is that d - cusum with one - bit or two - bit transmissions is either very close or even outperforms this _ infinite - bit _ q - cusum .",
    "finally , we should also note that when the average communication period is small ( @xmath286 ) , there is a considerable improvement in d - cusum when using two , instead of one , bits per transmission ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) . on the other hand , when the average communication period is large ( @xmath287 ) , we do not observe similar performance gains for d - cusum by having the sensors transmit additional bits to the fusion center ( see fig.[fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is a novel decentralized sequential detection rule , that we called d - cusum , according to which each sensor communicates with the fusion center at two - sided exit times of its local log - likelihood ratio and the fusion center uses in parallel a cusum - like rule in order to detect the change .",
    "we showed that the performance loss of d - cusum with respect to the optimal centralized cusum is bounded as the rate of false alarms goes to 0 ( _ second order _",
    "asymptotic optimality ) .",
    "moreover , we showed that its first - order asymptotic optimality is preserved even with an asymptotically low communication rate and large number of sensors .",
    "we illustrated these properties with simulation experiments , which also showed that d - cusum performs significantly better than a cusum - based , decentralized detection rule that requires communication at deterministic times .",
    "we assumed throughout the paper that observations from different sensors are independent , an assumption which is not needed for the optimality of the centralized cusum test , but is universal in the decentralized literature .",
    "this assumption is necessary both for the design and the analysis of d - cusum in discrete time , however it is possible to remove it in continuous time , at least when the sensors observe _ correlated _ brownian motions . indeed , going over the proof of theorem [ prop1 ] in appendix[app : a ] , we realize that this assumption is needed only to the extent that it guarantees a decomposition of the form @xmath291 , where @xmath292 is an @xmath293-adapted process with continuous paths . that is , we did not use explicitly the fact that @xmath292 is the local log - likelihood ratio at sensor @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that theorem [ prop1 ] will remain valid even for sensors with correlated dynamics , as long as such a decomposition is possible .",
