    "since the discovery of the laser , technological progresses have allowed to produce optical sources of constantly growing power .",
    "laser intensities can now be so high that atoms and molecules , when exposed to such electric fields , can absorb simultaneously a large number of photons , leading to highly nonlinear dynamics and to the observation of phenomena such as strong field ionization or high - order harmonic @xcite and attosecond pulse @xcite generation . more particularly , at moderate intensity , the efficiency of these processes scales as a fixed power of the intensity .",
    "for instance , the rate of multiphoton ionization is well approximated by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the laser intensity and @xmath2 is the minimal number of photons that the electronic wavepacket needs to absorb for escaping from the ionic attractive potential .",
    "as the intensity rises ( typically higher than a few 10 tw/@xmath3 ) , the electronic structure of the system is strongly distorted allowing the occurrence of processes such as tunnel ionization , above - threshold ionization , and ionization channel closure . as a consequence",
    ", the very simple relation linking laser intensity and ionization does not hold anymore . instead",
    ", only an effective nonlinearity , which can also depend on the intensity , can be extracted from experiments .",
    "for instance , an effective nonlinearity @xmath47.5 @xcite has been determined for the ionization rate of argon at 800 nm for @xmath5 50 tw/@xmath3 , while a nonlinearity of 11 is expected in the multiphoton regime .",
    "the nonlinearity of a process @xmath6 is generally determined by fitting the measured process yield by a function proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "unfortunately , due to the highly nonlinear nature of the process , the dynamic range needed for an accurate measurement of such an effective nonlinearity is hardly achievable experimentally and leads to large uncertainties in the determination of @xmath8 . in this paper ,",
    "a simple method to determine the nonlinearity of any optical processes is implemented .",
    "this method is based on optical interferences induced by two crossed laser beams and relies only on two measurements in contrast with standard methods which need to reconstruct the dependence of the process as a function of the intensity on several decades .",
    "the presented method , which can be applied to any nonlinear process , is demonstrated analytically , numerically , and experimentally in the case of ionization .",
    "the proposed strategy also provides a control and enhance the production efficiency of the nonlinear process .",
    "in particular , we show that the yield can be increased by several order of magnitude and that the overall energy needed for the production of any nonlinear process in the two - beam geometry is reduced up to a factor 2 as compared to the single beam geometry . in the first section ,",
    "the principle of the method is presented analytically and compared to full 3d+1 pulse nonlinear propagation simulations . in the second section ,",
    "experimental results are presented and compared to theoretical results in several gases , leading to the determination of the effective nonlinearity driving the ionization process in these gases .",
    "the method presented in this paper is based on the fact that any nonlinear process is enhanced when , at constant energy level , two coherent pulses spatially interfere as compared to a single pulse experiment . in the first subsection , the principle is demonstrated with infinite plane waves . in the second subsection",
    ", the concept is extended analytically to gaussian beams propagating linearly . finally , the result is compared to realistic full 3d+1 nonlinear propagation simulations .",
    "the comparison between analytical calculations and numerical simulations is of particular importance when dealing with bulk media since nonlinear effects usually lead to strong deviations between analytical results obtained in the linear regime and realistic propagation resulting in large uncertainty on the experimental determination of the nonlinearity .      in this section ,",
    "analytical gain on a nonlinear process is derived when two crossing plane waves with same carrier frequencies interfere .",
    "assuming infinitely extended plane waves , the electric field envelope @xmath9 composed of two distinct crossing fields writes    @xmath10    where @xmath11 ( resp .",
    "@xmath12 ) is the electric field envelope of the first ( resp .",

    "the signal @xmath24 induced by a single beam with the same averaged intensity is given by    @xmath25    the gain @xmath26 then writes @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hypergeometric function .",
    "figure [ fig:1](a ) shows the gain @xmath26 as a function of @xmath29 for several nonlinearities .",
    "the gain on the nonlinear process can easily be controlled by adjusting the relative energy of the two pump beams .",
    "the maximal gain is obtained when the energy is equally shared between the two beams ( @xmath30 , _",
    "i.e. _ when the fringe contrast is maximal ( @xmath31 ) . in this case , the gain @xmath32 compared to a single pulse of intensity @xmath20 writes @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the gamma function . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) , the obtained gain is monotonic with the nonlinearity @xmath2 so that the determination of the gain leads in turn to the unambiguous determination of the nonlinearity . using this method , the determination of the nonlinearity only requires two measurements ( @xmath24 and @xmath35 ) unlike conventional methods which need to reconstruct the full dependence of the nonlinear process as a function of the intensity .     for different nonlinearity orders @xmath2 .",

    "the gain on the generation of any nonlinear process has been derived for infinite plane waves .",
    "considering plane waves is a useful approximation for understanding the proposed method and provides very simple analytical formula .",
    "nevertheless , most of nonlinear processes are produced with non collimated beams . in this section , the gain on a nonlinear process is therefore derived in the case of gaussian beams undergoing a linear propagation .",

    "this reduction is diminished when the interaction region is limited by the length of the nonlinear medium itself rather than by the crossing effect . for low nonlinearities ,",
    "the generation of the nonlinear process is even reduced as compared with the single beam case .",

    ", the same amount of nonlinear signal can be obtained in the two - pulse scheme with a total energy down to half the one required in the single pulse geometry . moreover , the presented method leads to very efficient optimization ( about one order of magnitude for nonlinearity @xmath2=8 - 9 ) of the nonlinear process generation , in particular if one compares with standard control strategy based on optical pulse shaping @xcite .",
    "we chose to test the presented method with the photoionization process .",
    "in this case , the interferences between the two pulses lead to the formation of a plasma grating .",
    "such a grating has been the subject of rising interest .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that a moving plasma grating formed by two intersecting lasers of slightly different central frequency leads to an energy exchange between them @xcite or that a stationary grating formed with pulses of same frequency results in the divergence or in the redirection of a third laser beam @xcite . in order to assess the analytical results derived above and evaluate the influence of nonlinear propagation effects such as intensity clamping in realistic experimental conditions , full 3d+1 numerical propagation calculations were performed .",

    "we chose @xmath2=7.5 since it is the widely admitted effective nonlinearity driving the ionization rate in argon .",
    "finally , we considered the same gas pressure ( 0.4 bar ) than the one used during our experiments .    in the two - beam case ,",
    "two gaussian pulses propagating slightly off - axis ( @xmath733@xmath56 ) with respect to the @xmath43 axis and crossing along the @xmath42 dimension have been considered .",

    "as expected , the production of free electrons is enhanced as soon as the pulses overlap . the maximal gain , which is obtained when the two pulses perfectly overlap ( @xmath43=0 ) , is about 37 in perfect agreement with eq .",
    "[ eq : gplane ] , which indicates that the plane wave approximation is valid in this particular situation . a remarkable agreement between analytical and numerical results",
    "is found when comparing the evolution of the free electrons gains all along the propagation as shown in figure [ fig:3](b ) .",
    "the gain of free electrons averaged over the whole propagation obtained analytically ( eq . [ eq : gaussianwave ] ) and numerically only differs by 0.2 @xmath80 ( 5.45 and 5.44 , respectively ) .",
    "it ensures that nonlinear propagation effects do not significantly alter the linear propagation , at least in the present initial energy and pressure conditions , and consequently validates the analytical results .",

    "the energy of the probe is about 4 @xmath80 of the total energy in p@xmath83 .",
    "moreover , its polarization is rotated by 90@xmath56 with respect to the polarization of the pumps .",

    "the waist of the pulses , @xmath86 m , were measured at weak intensity with the help of a camera .",
    "after the static cell , the probe is selected with the help of a polarizer .",

    "the cross - defocusing signal is then proportional to the square of refractive index change resulting from the ionization mechanism and accordingly proportional to the square of the amount of free electrons generated during the experiment .",
    "it then allows a direct experimental measurement of the latter .",
    "since the defocusing signal induced in the two - pulse scheme is about 30 times higher than the one induced during the single pulse experiment , a calibrated optical density is added before the photomultiplier during the former in order to keep the detection dynamics constant and to avoid a saturation of the photomultiplier .",

    "as far as the single pulse case is concerned , the defocusing signal increases as soon as the pump and probe pulses temporally overlap and then remains roughly constant for the rest of the scan , as expected from plasma - induced defocusing ( both electrons recombination and diffusion are negligible over the considered temporal window ) .",
    "in the two - pulse experiment , the defocusing signal remains hardly distinguishable on the scale of the figure until the two pulses temporally overlap , resulting in a sharp increase of the signal .",
