    "note that due to symmetry arguments discussed above , in @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath32 $ ] , it is not necessary to consider the @xmath96-boundary and hence we need not define the topmost prime",

    "is the same as the second largest edge cost in the mst - based path from the starting prime to the frontier prime .",
    "further , in a bounded graph with an @xmath91-boundary and/or a @xmath96-boundary , if the primes closest to these boundaries are at a distance from the boundary that is greater than the moat then the moat is a valid moat in the unbounded graph ( without these boundaries ) .    in order to find the mst covering the starting prime and the frontier prime , we specifically use kruskal s algorithm that greedily adds edges to the mst in increasing order of the edge lengths .",

    "hence , an mst - based path between two nodes is guaranteed to also minimize the largest edge cost in the path between the nodes .",
    "hence , the existence of a @xmath2-moat is indicated by kruskal s algorithm once an edge of cost greater than @xmath2 is added to the set of edges that will eventually form a minimum spanning tree including the starting prime .",
    "the frontier prime prior to the addition of this edge is the farthest prime that one can traverse to from the starting prime , if one is allowed to traverse edges of length @xmath122 .",

    "once an edge of cost greater than @xmath123 is added by kruskal s algorithm to the minimum spanning tree causing the discovery of a new frontier prime , then we have a possible @xmath123-moat .",
    "however , it is possible that if we included points outside the boundary , there could have been an edge with cost less than or equal to @xmath123 , allowing a traversal farther out . in order to check this",
    ", we compute the distance @xmath124 from the rightmost prime to the @xmath91-boundary line @xmath93 , and ( in the fields with @xmath12-fold symmetry ) the distance @xmath125 from the top - most prime to the @xmath96-boundary line @xmath97 .",
