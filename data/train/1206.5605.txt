    "out of the hundreds of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) so far observed with known redshifts , there are approximately ten grbs with an isotropic energy @xmath7 erg : grb 990123 , grb 990506 , grb 000131 , grb 050820a , grb 050904 , grb 080319b , grb 080607 , grb 080721 , grb 080916c , grb 090323 , grb 090926a ,",

    "[ tab : epeak ] in sec .",

    "grb 080319b was discovered by bat on march 19 , 2008 @xcite .",
    "it has a redshift @xmath18 @xcite and is characterized by an extraordinarily bright optical emission accompanying its @xmath10-ray emission , that makes it the brightest optical burst ever observed : with a peak visual magnitude of 5.3 , it could have been seen with the naked eye by an observer in a dark location @xcite .",
    "it is also one of the brightest grbs in @xmath10 and x rays .",
    "this extremely bright optical flash has promoted an intense theoretical analysis on the role of synchrotron self - compton ( ssc , see sec .",
    "[ sec : sedprompt ] ) radiation and this scenario has been investigated by several authors , including e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there has been also interest in examining the possible existence of beaming in order to reduce the energetics of this source .",
    "@xcite proposed a two - component jet model : a narrow jet , with a half - opening angle @xmath19 , dominating the early emission , surrounded by a wider jet , with @xmath20 , dominating the emission at intermediate and late times .",
    "this two - jet model would reduce the total energy budget to @xmath21 erg .",
    "however , the narrow jet should produce a jet break @xmath22 1 hr post - burst , which has not been observed .",
    "@xcite suggested that this could be explained if the optical flux of the narrow jet is fainter than that of the wider jet .",
    "the wider jet should give rise to a break at @xmath23 s. @xcite reported the observation of a jet break at @xmath24 days with an `` approximately achromatic behaviour '' , recalling that , in the _ swift _ era , the expected `` achromatic behaviour of breaks in x - ray and optical light curves has been rarely seen @xcite '' .",
    "an alternative single jet model has been considered by @xcite : taking into account the lack of an optical jet break during the first ten days of emission , they find a lower limit @xmath25 .",
    "the energy of the grb could in this case be @xmath26 erg ( twice larger for a double - sided jet ) .",
    "grb 050904 was discovered by bat on september 4 , 2005 @xcite .",

    "the beaming - corrected energy is @xmath31 erg @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we limit the analysis of these two sources to the @xmath10-ray emission of the prompt phase , which is energetically predominant with respect to the optical emission : the optical isotropic energy is @xmath32 of @xmath8 @xcite for grb 080319b and is even less for grb 050904 .",
    "also in view of the absence of achromatic breaks required by the jetted emission model , for grb 080319b and grb 050904 we assume spherical symmetry , which is one of the main features of the fireshell model .",
    "we recall that a satisfactory agreement between the theoretical predictions of the fireshell model and the observed light curves and spectra of grbs with @xmath8 up to @xmath9 erg has been previously obtained .",
    "what is really new in the analysis of these two sources is : 1 ) the very large value of @xmath13 , well above the _ swift _ bat bandpass ( see fig .  [",

    "[ tab : epeak ] ) ; 2 ) the fact that for both sources the _ swift _ bat bandpass covers the low energy part of the spectrum , that could then be investigated ; 3 ) in the case of lower energetic sources , the energy region near the peak has been observed by bat , while the low energy spectral component has been missed ( see fig .",

    "the behaviour of the spectra around the peak energy is not significantly affected by the value of @xmath5 ( see sec .",
    "[ newsed ] ) . for the higher energetic sources , the low energy component of the spectra falls inside the energy band covered by bat ;",
    "this is not the case for the lower energetic sources , for which only the region around the peak can be investigated . ]    in both grb 080319b and grb 050904 , _ swift _ bat data show more power in the low energy region than the theoretical predictions of the fireshell model ( see sec .",
    "[ grb080319b ] ) .",
    "we then introduce a new phenomenological spectrum in the comoving frame of the fireshell : the `` modified '' thermal spectrum ( see sec .",

    "[ fig : sp20s ] , does not modify significantly the considerations on the less energetic grbs previously discussed within the fireshell model , since in that case only the region encompassing the peak is inside the instrument bandpass and is not significantly affected by the value of @xmath5 ; 3 ) predicts a possible broader emission in the low energy spectral component of the lower energetics grbs which will possibly be tested by future missions below 10 kev such as , e.g. , loft @xcite and mirax @xcite .",
    "these observations will determine the possible general validity of the comoving spectrum introduced here .",
    "it will also be important to verify if an analogous phenomenological correction in the wien part of the comoving blackbody spectrum will allow the interpretation of the high energy data ( above hundreds of mev ) later observed in equally energetic grbs by agile and _ fermi_. in this respect , it must be noted that an extra high - energy power - law component has been actually invoked in the current literature to explain the emission above hundreds mev observed in e.g. grb 090902b @xcite , grb 090510 @xcite and grb 090926a @xcite .",
    "however , the phenomenological extra power - law component characterizing the low energy tail of the new comoving spectrum introduced here is not necessarily related to the low energy extrapolation of such a high - energy component .",
    "in fact it is also present in sources which show no evidence of high energy emission , like e.g. grb 090618 @xcite and grb 101023 .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sedprompt ] we describe the phenomenological and theoretical interpretation of grb prompt emission . in sec .",
    "[ fmodel ] we briefly outline the fireshell model , we introduce the `` modified '' thermal spectrum and explain how we perform the numerical simulations to be compared with the observational data . in secs .",
    "[ grb080319b ] and [ grb050904 ] we present , as specific examples , the analysis of grb 080319b and grb 050904 observations of the prompt @xmath10-ray emission . in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] we discuss the possible explanation for the need to introduce the `` modified '' thermal spectrum and in sec .",
    "[ concl ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the study of the grb prompt emission is often performed by means of phenomenological approaches consisting , for example , in modeling the burst spectra with empirical functions whose parameters are fixed by the @xmath35 minimization procedure of the spectral data .",
    "the explanation of the results obtained from such phenomenological approaches are a main goal of the theoretical models of grbs .",
    "the photon number spectrum time - integrated over the grb prompt emission duration is typically best fit by two power - laws joined smoothly at a given break energy ( the  band function ",
    "* ) , whose low energy and high energy photon indices , @xmath5 and @xmath36 , have median values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively @xcite .",
    "another example of phenomenological analysis is the correlation between the rest - frame value of the peak energy @xmath39 and the isotropic equivalent radiated @xmath10-ray energy @xmath8 , which leads to a power - law dependece : @xmath40 , with @xmath41 .",
    "there is also an additional phenomenological relation which has manifested itself in recent years , attracting attention : the possibility of fitting the observed spectra , integrated over selected time intervals , by a blackbody plus power - law ( bb+pl ) .",
    "there are cases in which the grb spectrum , again integrated over selected time intervals , is statistically indistinguishable between fits with a band function and a bb+pl ; there are other cases in which the bb+pl model is even preferred over the band function and finally there are sources for which the data fulfill the band function but not the bb+pl @xcite .",
    "generally , the additional blackbody component occurs in the early part of the prompt emission ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are bursts for which it is dominant with respect to the power - law , but opposite cases also exist , in which the power - law component is predominant with respect to the thermal one ; the relative intensity of the two components can vary with time @xcite .    in some interesting cases",
    "the blackbody component shows a characteristic evolution in time , with both its observed temperature and flux having a dependence from the arrival time well described by a broken power - law with indexes @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "it is appropriate to emphasize that the correspondence between different spectral models can not , in general , be applied to the entire grb light curve .",
    "there is then the necessity of identifying the specific time interval over which the different spectral features are identified , also possibly in order to recover their physical origin ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , for grb 080319b and grb 050904 both time - resolved and time - integrated bat spectra , including the ( p - grb , see below sec .  [ sec : cangrb ] ) spectrum of grb 080319b , are best fit by a simple power - law ( see sec .",
    "[ grb080319b ] and [ grb050904 ] ; see also @xcite and ) ; alternative models , such as a band function or a bb+pl , can not be constrained by the bat data .",
    "no concluding statements on the presence of a blackbody component in the p - grb of grb 080319b can be made due to the limited bandpass of the instruments ( see sec .",
    "[ grb080319b ] ) . the analysis of _",
    "konus_-wind data from grb 080319b has shown a best fit with a band function @xcite .",
    "for grb 050904 @xcite performed a joint spectral analysis among _ swift _ bat , _",
    "suzaku_-wam and _ konus_-wind , finding a good fit with both a power - law with exponential cutoff and the band function .",
    "a blackbody component has not been observed in either of these two sources .",
    "it is not clear at this stage if different conclusions could have been reached if these sources would have been observed by _",
    "fermi _ or agile .",
    "many different models have been developed to theoretically explain the observational properties of grbs .",
    "one of the most quoted ones is the fireball model ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "an alternative one , originating in the electrodynamical processes around a kerr - newmann black hole @xcite , is the fireshell model .",
    "the fireball model was first proposed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who have shown that the release of a large quantity of @xmath10-ray photons into a compact region can lead to an optically thick photon - lepton `` fireball '' through the production of @xmath46 pairs .",
    "the term `` fireball '' refers to an opaque plasma whose initial energy is significantly greater than its rest mass @xcite .",
    "the fireshell model also starts from an optically thick @xmath46 plasma whose evolution has been followed in a sequence of states of thermal equilibrium , taking properly into account the ultrarelativistic expansion and the detailed computation of the rate equation for the @xmath46 annihilation ( see sec .  [ sec : cangrb ] and ) .    in the fireball model , the prompt emission , including the sharp luminosity variations @xcite , are due to the prolonged and variable activity of the `` inner engine '' @xcite .",
    "the conversion of the fireball energy to radiation occurs via shocks , either internal ( when faster moving matter overtakes a slower moving shell , see @xcite ) or external ( when the moving matter is slowed down by the external medium surrounding the burst , see @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , for grb 080319b internal shocks have been considered responsible for the prompt emission ( @xcite ; see , however , @xcite ) and external shocks are then considered responsible for the afterglow ( see also , however , @xcite and references therein ) . for grb 050904 proposed that internal shocks are responsible for both the prompt and the afterglow emission ( see , however , for a detailed description of limits and advantages of both the internal and the external shock scenario ) .    much attention has been given to synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons , possibly accompanied by ssc emission to explain the observed grb spectrum .",
    "these processes were found to be consistent with the observational data of many grbs ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , several limitations have been evidenced in relation with the low energy spectral slopes of time - integrated spectra ( see @xcite , @xcite , and ; see also , however , @xcite ) and time - resolved spectra ( see @xcite and ) ; additional limitations on ssc have also been pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .    in all the above considerations ,",
    "the equations of motion of the fireball are evaluated under the ultrarelativistic approximation , leading to the @xcite self - similar power - law solution ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : cangrb ] ) . the maximum lorentz factor of the fireball is estimated from the temporal occurrence of the peak of the optical emission , which is identified with the peak of the forward external shock emission in the thin shell approximation @xcite . it was also proposed to put an upper limit on the maximum fireball lorentz gamma factor from the upper limit on the intensity of a possible smooth background signal in the hard x - rays to soft gamma rays during the prompt emission , which is identified with the contribution of the forward external shock emission to the prompt phase @xcite .",
    "another proposal was advanced to use compactness arguments within a scenario with two separate emitting regions for the mev and the gev emissions @xcite .    partly alternative and/or complementary",
    "scenarios to the fireball model have been developed , e.g. the ones based on : quasi - thermal comptonization , compton drag emission @xcite , synchrotron emission from a decaying magnetic field @xcite , jitter radiation @xcite , compton scattering of synchrotron self - absorbed photons @xcite , photospheric emission .",
    "in particular , @xcite pointed out that photospheric emission overcomes some of the difficulties of pure non - thermal emission models .",
    "in this paper we focus on the fireshell model .",
    "the characteristic parameters of the model are the total energy @xmath47 , the baryon loading @xmath48 and the circumburst medium ( cbm ) density @xmath49 ( see secs .  [",
    "sec : cangrb ] and [ procedure ] ) . the lorentz @xmath10 factor , directly linked to @xmath48 and @xmath47 , is explicitly computed from the description of all the phases starting from the moment of gravitational collapse .",
    "the fireshell radial coordinate is explicitly evaluated as a function of the laboratory time , the comoving time and the arrival time at the detector ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : cangrb ] ) .",
    "the optically thick @xmath46 plasma , endowed with baryon loading , is followed all the way to transparency .",
    "the collision with the cbm of the emerging relativistic expanding shell of baryons gives rise to the extended afterglow , which comprises both the prompt emission and the traditional decaying afterglow phases ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : cangrb ] ) .",
    "relativistic effects are taken into account in the computation of the equations of motion of the shell and of the equitemporal surfaces ( eqts , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see sec .",
    "[ sec : easpectrum ] ) . taking into proper account these relativistic effects ,",
    "it is possible to deduce the spectrum of the collision process between the baryons and the cbm in the comoving frame of the shell .",
    "for simplicity it was initially assumed that such collisions occur in a fully radiative regime and give rise to a pure thermal spectrum in the comoving frame ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : easpectrum ] ) .",
    "the observed spectrum is then obtained as a double convolution of thousands of thermal spectra , each one with a different temperature and weighted by the appropriate lorentz and doppler factors , following the solution of the equations of motion of the fireshell , both over the eqts and over the observation time @xcite thermal spectra for each second of observation has been used . ] .    as we recalled in the introduction ,",
    "this ansatz of a pure black body spectrum in the fireshell comoving frame , in spite of its simplicity , led to a successful interpretation of many different sources with an @xmath13 inside the instrumental bandpass .",
    "we were then quite confident that we could obtain any observed power - law by an adequate convolution of thermal spectra duly weighted by the relativistic doppler factors .",
    "the impossibility of obtaining the correct power - law indexes observed in both the sources treated in this paper , which have an @xmath13 above the instrumental bandpass , using solely thermal spectra in the fireshell comoving frame , was quite unexpected .",
    "this impossibility stems from the fact that neither the distribution of the temperature in the comoving frame , nor the doppler factors used in the thousands of convolution processes , can be arbitrarily given .",
    "both of them are constrained by the equations of motion of the fireshell and by the consequent release of kinetic energy in the collision .",
    "a priori , a convolution of thermal spectra with arbitrary temperatures and doppler factors can always fit any observed power - law .",
    "there is , however , no way to fit by convolutions of thermal spectra the observed power - laws consistently with the fireshell equations of motion in these two sources with @xmath13 above the instrumental bandpass .",
    "what is particularly interesting , however , is the fact that this difficulty can be overcome simply by adding an extra power - law component to the pure black body spectrum . as we will see , the application of the fireshell model to grb 080319b and grb 050904 leads in fact to the introduction of an additional phenomenological parameter @xmath5 , which characterizes the departure of the slope of the low energy part of the comoving spectrum from a pure thermal one ( see sec .  [ newsed ] )",
    ".    this new result is consistent also with all the previously analyzed grbs , and reasons for this are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : sp20s ] .",
    "the success of this approach is not trivial , since there is no direct analytic relation between the index of the power - law introduced in the spectrum in the fireshell comoving frame and the observed one .",
    "it is quite significant that the introduction of a single power - law makes the fireshell model consistent with all observed grb spectra",
    ".    the physical explanation for @xmath5 has not yet been found .",
    "analogously , no physical explanation has yet been found for the above described ( sec .",
    "[ phen ] ) phenomenological parameters of the band function and of the amati relation , and in this sense for the ones described by @xcite and @xcite as well .",
    "all these phenomenological parameters lead to a better quantitative description of grbs ; they are the object of active theoretical studies and are an important step toward reaching the future identification of the underlying physical processes characterizing the grbs .",
    "we now proceed to a detailed description of the fireshell model ( sec .",
    "[ fmodel ] ) .",
    "the fireshell model , avoiding a piecewise fit of the observed grb data , proposes a unified picture starting from the initial process of gravitational collapse to a black hole through all successive stages .",
    "it gives a theoretical treatment of each stage , identifying the parameters intrinsic to the source , essential to describing the evolution of the system , as well as its interaction with the cbm .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion are treated accordingly .",
    "regimes of lorentz gamma factors in the range @xmath50@xmath51 are encountered , implying the necessity of a fully relativistic approach . the model is intrinsically endowed with highly nonlinear effects : each prediction of the theoretical model at a given instant of the observation time is influenced by the entire history of the source .",
    "consequently , any solution of the model in agreement with the observations necessarily implies a high level of self - consistency .      within the fireshell model ,",
    "all grbs originate from an optically thick electron  positron plasma in thermal equilibrium , having total energy @xmath47 and formed in the gravitational collapse to a black hole @xcite .",
    "the condition of thermal equilibrium assumed in our model and proved by @xcite distinguishes our model from alternative approaches ( e.g. the one by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the total annihilation of the @xmath46 plasma was assumed , leading to a vast release of energy pushing on the cbm ( the concept of a `` fireball '' ) . in our case",
    "the annihilation of the @xmath46 pairs occurs gradually and is confined within an expanding shell : the `` fireshell '' . the rate equation for the @xmath46 pairs and their dynamics ( the pair - electromagnetic pulse or pem pulse for short ) has been given by .",
    "this plasma engulfs the baryonic material left over in the process of gravitational collapse having mass @xmath52 , still keeping thermal equilibrium between electrons , positrons and baryons .",
    "the baryon loading is measured by the dimensionless parameter @xmath53 .",
    "it was shown that no relativistic expansion of the plasma can be found for @xmath54 .",
    "the fireshell is still optically thick and self - accelerates to ultrarelativistic velocities .",
    "then the fireshell becomes transparent and the p - grb is emitted @xcite .",
    "the amount of energy radiated in the p - grb is only a fraction of @xmath47 .",
    "the remaining energy is stored in the kinetic energy of the optically thin baryonic and leptonic matter fireshell .",
    "the final lorentz @xmath10 factor at transparency , @xmath55 , can vary in a vast range between @xmath56 and @xmath57 as a function of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "after transparency , the remaining accelerated baryonic matter still expands ballistically and starts to slow down by the collisions with the cbm , having average density @xmath49 . during this phase , the extended afterglow emission occurs @xcite . in common with the majority of existing models ,",
    "we describe the motion of the baryons as an expanding thin shell enforcing energy and momentum conservation in the collision with the cbm .",
    "the condition of a fully radiative regime is assumed @xcite .",
    "it is appropriate to recall a further difference between our treatment and the ones in the current literature .",
    "the complete analytic solution of the equations of motion of the baryonic shell has been developed @xcite , while in the current literature usually the @xcite self - similar solution has been uncritically adopted .",
    "the similarities and differences between the two approaches have been explicitly pointed out in @xcite .    from this general approach ,",
    "a canonical grb bolometric light curve is defined which is composed of two different parts : the p - grb and the extended afterglow .",
    "the relative energetics of these two components , as well as the observed temporal separation between the corresponding peaks , is a function of the above three parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ; the first two parameters are inherent to the accelerator characterizing the grb , i.e. , the optically thick phase , while the third one is inherent to the grb surrounding environment which gives rise to the extended afterglow .",
    "what is usually called the grb `` prompt emission '' in the literature is actually composed of both the p - grb and the initial part of the extended afterglow encompassing its peak .",
    "as we proposed in @xcite , both the so - called `` short '' and `` long '' grbs fit into this canonical grb scenario .",
    "in particular , for baryon loading @xmath58 , the p - grb component is energetically dominant over the extended afterglow . in the limit @xmath59",
    "it gives rise to a `` genuine short '' grb .",
    "otherwise , when @xmath60 , the kinetic energy of the baryonic and leptonic matter , and consequently the extended afterglow emission , predominates with respect to the p - grb , giving rise to the `` long '' grbs or the `` disguised short '' grbs depending on the average cbm density and the astrophysical scenario .",
    "since the `` critical '' value of @xmath48 ( i.e. the value of @xmath48 for which both the p - grb and the extended afterglow have the same energy ) is a slowly varying function of @xmath47 , for @xmath61 the ratio of the total energies of the p - grb and of the extended afterglow is also a function of @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "if one goes to the observational properties of this model of a relativistic expanding shell , a crucial concept has been the introduction of the eqts . in this topic , also , our model is distinguished from those in the literature for deriving analytic expressions for the eqts from the analytic solutions of the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "the observed temporal variability of the extended afterglow is produced in our model by the interaction of the fireshell with cbm `` clumps '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also sec .  [ procedure ] ) .",
    "the issue of time variability in grb light curves has been longly debated .",
    "several authors , e.g. @xcite , found that cbm inhomogeneities are not able to produce the short - timescale variability in grb prompt and afterglow emission light curves , mainly because photons emitted at the same instant of time from different parts of the emitting regions have different arrival times : this tends to smoothen the light curve significantly .    within the fireshell model , also on this point",
    "there are some differences with the other models .",
    "it is emphasized that , from the correct computations of the equations of motion of the shell and of the lorentz @xmath10 factor , the short time scale variability of grb light curves occurs in regimes with the largest values of the lorentz gamma factor , when the total visible area of the emission region is very small and the `` dispersion '' in arrival time of the luminosity peaks is negligible .",
    "therefore , under this condition the short - timescale variability of grb light curves can be produced by inhomogeneities in the cbm , as found also by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the application of the fireshell model leads to a direct evaluation of the filamentary and clumpy structure of the cbm , which was already predicted in pioneering works by enrico fermi in the theoretical study of interstellar matter ( ism ) in our galaxy @xcite , and is much on line with the knowledge obtained from various studies of the ism in galaxies ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "clearly , the fact that the short time scale variability is observed only in the prompt emission , while the x - ray afterglow light curves are usually smooth , does not mean that the cbm is inhomogeneous only up to a given radius , beyond which it becomes homogeneous .",
    "inhomogeneities are everywhere in the cbm , but beyond a given distance from the source , corresponding approximately to the end of the prompt emission phase , they do not produce observable effects on the light curve since they are indeed smeared out by the curvature effect and the relativistic effects between the time in the fireshell comoving frame and the photon arrival time at the detector @xcite .",
    "the early x - ray afterglow originates in fact from the same kind of interaction of the fireshell with a clumpy cbm .",
    "the absence of spiky emission is simply a consequence of these effects .",
    "in other words , it is true that the fireshell model predicts that the same clumps at larger radii would produce longer spikes @xcite .",
    "however , at such large radii where the effect would be measurable , the smearing dominates and prevents the effect to be observed @xcite .",
    "vice versa , the prompt emission , where the effect of the cbm clumps are observable , occurs encompassing too limited a range of radial distances to make this effect noticeable in all sources .",
    "the only exception may occur in the case of isolated high density clumps along the line of sight at late time of emission where indeed this effect is observable @xcite .",
    "we are currently verifying if this aspect of the fireshell model may also explain some specific properties of the x - ray flares recently evidenced in the afterglow phase ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the drop in energy of 24 orders of magnitude from the prompt @xmath10-ray phase to the early x - ray afterglow is perfectly in line with the decrease of the lorentz gamma factor in the expansion of the fireshell .",

    "it is appropriate to stress that in the emission of the p - grb there are two different contributions : one corresponding to the emission of the photons due to the reach of the transparency , and the second originating from the interaction of the protons and electrons with the cbm .",
    "a spectral energy distribution with a thermal component and a non - thermal one should be expected to occur .",
    "the majority of work in the current literature has addressed the analysis of the prompt emission as originating from various combinations of synchrotron and inverse compton processes @xcite .",
    "it appears clear , however , that this interpretation is not satisfactory ( see sec .",

    "furthermore , in the description of an ultrarelativistic collision between protons and electrons and the cbm new collective processes of ultrarelativistic plasma physics occur , not yet fully explored and understood ( e.g. weibel instability , see * ? ? ?",
    "most promising results along this line have been already obtained by @xcite .    without waiting for the developments of these investigations",
    ", we have adopted a very pragmatic approach in the fireshell model by making full use of the knowledge of the equations of motion , of all the eqts formulations as well as of the correct relativistic transformations between the comoving frame of the fireshell and the observer frame . in this respect , we have adopted a fundamental procedure : to make an ansatz on the spectral properties of emission of the collisions between the baryons and the cbm in the comoving frame , and then evaluate all the observational properties in the observer frame . in order to take into proper account the filamentary , clumpy and porosity structure of the cbm , we have introduced an additional parameter @xmath62 , which describes the fireshell surface filling factor .",
    "it is defined as the ratio between the effective emitting area of the fireshell @xmath63 and its total visible area @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that the fact that only a fraction @xmath62 of the shell surface is emitting does not mean that only a fraction @xmath62 of the total shell energy is emitted .",
    "we must in fact distinguish between an instantaneous interaction of the fireshell with a single filament and its overall interaction with all the filaments of the entire cloud giving rise to the spiky structure of the light curve .",
    "this global interaction is clearly the superposition of randomly distributed instantaneous events .",
    "the different filaments inside the cloud interact with different parts of the fireshell and the entire cloud reduces the kinetic energy of the entire fireshell .",
    "the key point is that , during the prompt emission , the cloud , typically with a mass of the order of @xmath65 solar masses , covers the entire visible area of the fireshell ( typically with a radius between @xmath66 cm and @xmath67 cm for the sources analyzed in the present paper , see tables [ tab:08density ] and [ tab:05density ] ) .",
    "consequently , at any given instant of time , each filament of the cloud covers only a small fraction of the fireshell surface .",

    "[ fig : spectra ] are shown several theoretically predicted instantaneous spectra characterized by the same temperature and different values of the free parameter @xmath5 .",

    "the spectrum is instead only weakly dependent on the value of @xmath5 .    in the present paper",
    "we test the comoving modified thermal spectrum by comparing the numerical simulations with the observed prompt emission spectra and light curves of highly energetic grbs .",
    "in particular we present , as specific examples , the analysis of the observational bat data ( in the @xmath101@xmath102 kev bandpass ) of grb 080319b ( @xmath103 erg , @xcite ) and grb 050904 ( @xmath12 erg , @xcite ) in secs .  [ grb080319b ] and [ grb050904 ] , respectively .      to best reproduce the observational data within the fireshell model , we need to determine the following five parameters : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath5 , @xmath49 and @xmath62 .",
    "the procedure assumes a specific value of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath47 has to be larger or equal to the observed isotropic equivalent energy @xmath8 of the grb .",
    "@xmath47 can be actually quite larger than @xmath8 since , in many sources , we are limited by the threshold and the bandpass of the detectors .",
    "the value of @xmath48 is determined by the ratio between the energetics of the p - grb and of the extended afterglow , as well as by the time separation between the corresponding peaks @xcite .",
    "the determination of the three remaining parameters depends on the detailed `` fitting '' of the shape of the extended afterglow light curves and spectra .",
    "in particular , the parameter @xmath62 determines the effective temperature in the comoving frame and the corresponding peak energy of the spectrum , @xmath5 determines the low energy slope of the comoving spectrum and @xmath49 determines the temporal behavior of the light curve .",
    "it is found that the cbm is typically formed of `` clumps '' of width @xmath104 cm and density contrast @xmath105 . particularly important",
    "is the determination of the average value of @xmath49 .",
    "values of the order of @xmath106@xmath107 particles/@xmath108 have been found for grbs exploding inside star forming region galaxies , while values of the order of @xmath109 particles/@xmath108 have been found for grbs exploding in galactic halos .",
    "of course , `` fitting '' a grb within the fireshell model is much more complex than simply fitting the @xmath110 spectrum with phenomenological analytic formulas for a finite temporal range of the data .",
    "it is a consistent picture , which has to `` fit '' the intrinsic parameters of the source , as well as its spectrum and its light curve temporal structure .",
    "concerning the theoretical spectrum to be compared with the observational data , it is obtained by an averaging procedure of instantaneous spectra . in turn",
    ", each instantaneous spectrum is linked to the fit of the observed multiband light curves in the chosen time interval .",
    "therefore , both the `` fit '' of the spectrum and of the observed multiband light curves have to be performed together and jointly optimized .",
    "moreover , the parameters used in the numerical simulations are not independent .",
    "in fact , they have to be computed self - consistently through the entire dynamical evolution of the system and not separately at each time step . for each spike in the light curve the parameters of the corresponding cbm clumps",
    "must be computed , taking into proper account all the thousands of convolutions of comoving spectra over each eqts leading to the observed spectrum .",
    "it is clear then that since the eqts encompass emission processes occurring at different comoving times , weighted by their lorentz and doppler factors , the `` fitting '' of a single spike of the light curve is not only a function of the properties of the specific cbm clump but of the entire previous history of the source .",
    "any step of the `` fitting '' process affects the entire following evolution and , viceversa , at any step a `` fit '' must be made consistently with all the previous and subsequent history : due to the non linearity of the system and to the eqts , any change in the `` fit '' produces observable effects up to a much later time .",
    "this implies that the `` fitting '' process can not proceed for successive temporal steps : the complete analysis must be applied to the entire grb as a whole , to avoid possible systematic error propagation from a temporal step to the following ones .",
    "this leads to an extremely complex trial and error procedure in the fitting of the data in which the uniqueness of the parameters defining the source are further and further narrowed down .",
    "of course , we can not expect the latest parts of the fit to be very accurate , since some of the basic hypotheses on the equations of motion , and the possible fragmentation of the shell , can affect the fitting procedure .",
    "we analyzed the grb 080319b prompt emission light curve and spectrum observed by bat within the fireshell model .",
    "as we already mentioned in the introduction , for grb 080319b we have @xmath15 kev , although there is a hard - to - soft spectral evolution going from with @xmath111 kev at @xmath112 s after the bat trigger to @xmath113 kev at @xmath114 s after the bat trigger , and the bat spectral index reduces from @xmath115 to @xmath116 at @xmath117 seconds after the bat trigger @xcite .",
    "several authors found some evidence of the possibility to separate the prompt emission of this source into two main episodes , partitioned at about 28 s after the bat trigger time .",
    "@xcite analyzed the variability time - scale @xmath118 of the @xmath10-ray prompt emission , finding that the first part of the light curve ( up to @xmath22 28 s ) is dominated by @xmath119 0.1 s , while the last part shows a much longer characteristic time - scale ( @xmath119 0.7 s ) .",
    "@xcite found that the arrival offset between the swift - bat 15 - 25 kev and 50 - 100 kev energy band ( @xmath10-ray spectral lag ) is maximum at t @xmath120 28 s and it appears to be anti - correlated with the arrival offset between prompt 15 - 350 kev @xmath10-rays and the optical emission observed by tortora ( optical/@xmath10-ray spectral lag ) , maximum at t @xmath121 28 s.    concerning the first episode , we identify the first 7 s of emission ( from -5 s up to 2 s after the bat trigger time ) with the p - grb ; the theoretically estimated total isotropic energy emitted in the p - grb and the observed temperature are @xmath122 erg and @xmath123 @xmath22 16 kev respectively .",
    "there are three main reasons that supports this interpretation :    1 .",
    "first , we performed the analysis of bat spectra integrated over sub - intervals of time encompassing the whole prompt emission by using the standard ftools package ( heasoft , version 6.10 ) .",
    "we found that all these spectra are best modeled with power - laws and a discontinuity in the hard - to - soft evolution came out a few seconds after the bat trigger time , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phindex ] ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , there is a clear soft - to - hard evolution up to @xmath22 1 s after the bat trigger time , while a typical hard - to - soft transition starts at about 8 s after bat trigger time .",
    "it is difficult to evaluate at what time exactly the discontinuity occurs : in fact , in the region between @xmath22 1 s and @xmath22 8 s , the photon index first appears to reach an asymptotic value of @xmath22 0.76 , then further decreases up to @xmath22 0.7 : this behaviour could be due to the partial superimposition of the contributions of both the p - grb and the extended afterglow .",
    "2 .   the second reason suggesting the interpretation of the first seconds of emission as the p - grb is that the optical emission starts at t @xmath22 9 s after the bat trigger time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : optical ] ) : in fact , within the fireshell model the optical radiation is expected in the extended afterglow , but not in the p - grb .",
    "it is important to point out that , besides the two above observational considerations , the identification of the first 7 s of emission as the p - grb is the only interpretation that allow us to constrain the values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 in such a way as to make a consistent fit of both the p - grb and the extended afterglow .    of course , none of these three arguments separately would give support to our interpretation : e.g. , the optical component could have also been present before @xmath124 s but unobserved due to the instrumental constraints .",
    "however , the redundant occurrence of all three arguments implies that our interpretation of the first 7 s as the p - grb component is fully compatible both with our theoretical framework and with the observed data .",
    "the p - grb spectrum is expected to be composed of a thermal plus a non - thermal component ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : pgrb ] ) .",
    "we found that the bat spectrum of the first 7 s of the prompt emission is best fit by a power - law with photon index @xmath10=0.84 @xmath28 0.04 , with a chi square value of @xmath125 for 60 degrees of freedom .",
    "the presence of the expected additional thermal component can not be constrained by the data ( c. guidorzi , private communication ) .",
    "a possibility is that thermal flux is much lower than the non - thermal one and then it is negligible .",
    "another alternative and/or complementary possibility is that the thermal component has been missed due to the limited bandpass of the instruments .",
    "it can be only matter of speculation if observations by _ fermi _ and agile would have led to a different conclusion .     1 s after the bat trigger time , while a typical hard - to - soft transition starts at about 8 s after the bat trigger time . in the region between @xmath22 1",

    "woniak and of aas . ]        the remaining part of the first episode ( from @xmath22 7 s up to about 28 s ) is interpreted as the peak of the extended afterglow , whose temporal variability is produced by the interaction with the cbm .",
    "the numerical simulation that best reproduces the light curve ( fig .  [ fig : lc08 ] ) and the time - integrated spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum08 ] ) of this first episode ( @xmath127 ) is obtained with the following parameters : @xmath128 erg , @xmath129 and @xmath6 ; the lorentz gamma factor at the transparency point , occurring at @xmath130 cm , is @xmath131 .",

    "the structure of the cbm adopted is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:08density ] and the adopted density contrast with respect to the average density is reported in tab .",
    "[ tab:08density ] .",
    "the distribution of the cbm is just an approximation of the real one , where the cbm density shows some smooth fluctuations around its trend during the fireshell evolution .",
    "nevertheless , it is sufficient to account for the observed variability in the luminosity .",
    "we must note that there is a sharp and short spike in the light curve @xmath134 s after the bat trigger time ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) which we are unable to reproduce within our model , based on a spherically symmetric approximate dynamics .",
    "for this spike to be interpreted , a fully three - dimensional description of the cbm is needed .",
    "however , we expect that this more detailed description will not modify the overall dynamics of the system .",
    "in fact , the fluence of this spike is @xmath135 of the fluence observed in the first episode ( between @xmath136 s and @xmath137 s ) and @xmath138 of the fluence of the entire prompt emission ( between @xmath136 s and @xmath139 s ) .",
    "therefore , the error introduced by the omission of this spike from the numerical simulation is much smaller than the difference between the co - moving pure thermal spectrum and the modified one discussed in this paper .",
    "we can then omit the spike from our analysis , without hampering qualitatively the conclusions of our paper .",

    "[ tab:08density ] ) .",
    "therefore , a fully three - dimensional modeling of the cbm is needed at such a distance .",
    "we have mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : sedprompt ] the central role of the phenomenological parameterizations in the description of grbs .",
    "in addition to the @xmath5 parameter here defined , we have recalled the @xcite formula , the relation and the coefficients described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although no physical explanation for these parameters have been reached , they represent certainly a fundamental step in reaching a quantitative and qualitative description of the source and help to understand the underlying physical process of grbs .    in the fireshell model",
    "the radiation observed in the bat data comes from an integration which takes into account the cbm filamentary structure and applies a double convolution , over the eqts and the observation time , of a mixing of the co - moving thermal and power - law components given by eq.([eq : denfmod ] ) . in the bat energy range",
    "the cutoffs of the thermal components give a fundamental contribution .",
    "it was therefore unexpected that the theoretically computed spectrum would have given rise to a power - law so closely resembling the observed one .",
    "there is no simple relation between the power - law index of the observed bat spectrum and the one of the power - law component in the co - moving spectrum given in eq.([eq : denfmod ] ) .",
    "when the co - moving thermal component becomes negligible at low enough energy , the co - moving spectrum is described by just the power - law component .",
    "the convolution of power - laws with the same index results in a power - law of that index .",
    "observations by xrt in the prompt emission of a highly energetic source , if available , may then give direct and independent information about the existence of the power - law component in eq.([eq : denfmod ] ) and on its index .",
    "if so confirmed , this power - law component would not be just a mere phenomenological optimization of the agreement between our theory and the observed bat spectra .",
    "it would be an independent physical component of the co - moving spectrum , whose index can be directly read from the observational data .",
    "this would give an additional strong confirmation of our model .",

    "<S> we compare them with the grb 080319b and grb 050904 observed time - resolved spectra , as well as with their time - integrated spectra and light curves . </S>",
    "<S> although grb 080319b and grb 050904 are at very different redshifts ( z=0.937 and z=6.29 respectively ) , a value of @xmath6 leads for both of them to a good agreement between the numerical simulations and the observed bat light curves , time - resolved and time - integrated spectra . </S>",
    "<S> such a modified spectrum is also consistent with the observations of previously analyzed less energetic grbs and reasons for this additional agreement are given . </S>",
    "<S> perspectives for future low energy missions are outlined . </S>"
