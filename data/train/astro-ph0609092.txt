    "recently , a new observational class of neutron stars has been proposed @xcite , comprising eleven sources defined by the phenomenon of fast ( 2 - 30 ms ) radio bursts , which repeat on timescales of 4min - 3hr . through period folding , periodicities were claimed to be found in the range of @xmath70.4 - 7s for ten of the eleven sources , which suggested association with rotating neutron stars . in three of the eleven sources , period derivatives",
    "were claimed , with one suggesting a magnetic field strength of 5 g  a possible magnetar .",
    "because the @xmath8 analysis remains unpublished and undescribed , we regard association of the radio - bursting population with neutron stars to be an unsupported hypothesis ; nonetheless , we adopt the hypothesis and nomenclature of referring to the sources as rotating radio transients ( rrats ) , and consider their association with neutron stars to be the leading hypothesis .",
    "the proposed class was recently made more intriguing by the discovery of transient pulsed radio emission from a known magnetar , xte  j1810 - 197 @xcite , with peak flux density @xmath91 jy and 895% polarization at 8.4 ghz , with period @xmath10 .",
    "the radio pulsation was not present prior to the 2003 discovery outburst of this magnetar @xcite , detected serendipitously from x - ray pulsations during observations of a nearby source ; sensitive x - ray observations found a fading two - temperature x - ray source , with luminosity @xmath11  s  on timescales of 300 and 900 days ( for two different temperature components ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , day - to - day fluctuations in the radio peak flux were observed , of @xmath122 .",
    "this is interpreted to imply the appearance of the radio pulsations is associated with the reconfiguration of the magnetar magnetic field , which takes place associated with magnetar bursting activity @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the observed process and rrats is unclear , however observation of radio and x - ray activity associated with transient magnetic field reconfiguration may be applicable to the rrats , in light of the observed transient nature of their radio emission .",
    "an x - ray counterpart has been reported for rrat j1819 - 1458 , discovered serendipitously as cxou j181934.1@xmath13145804 @xcite .",
    "this x - ray source was observed with absorption corrected flux 2 s  ( 0.5 - 8 kev , with an order of magnitude uncertainty due to uncertainty in the absorption ) detected within the 5  @xmath14 32error ellipse of the rrat . comparison with the source density of such x - ray sources find the probability of finding such a bright source by chance @xmath15 , compared with the _ asca _ galactic plane survey @xcite , at the best - fit unabsorbed flux of 2 s. the x - ray spectrum is soft ( @xmath16=12040 ev ) , which supports classification of a thermal , cooling isolated neutron star ( ins )  further supported by the absence of a positionally coincident optical or infrared counterpart .",
    "the most convincing evidence for association cxou j181934.1@xmath13145804 with rrat j1819 - 1458 is the low probability of finding such a bright x - ray source in the rrat positional error circle .",
    "as reynolds point out , the observed soft spectrum in light of the high galactic column density ( = 1.6 cm ) in the direction of this source strongly supports interpretation of the x - ray source as within the galaxy , further supporting an neutron star interpretation .    a second source , , has an error ellipse of 15@xmath147(1@xmath17 ) , which includes the prolific transient neutron star low - mass x - ray binary aql x-1 @xcite .",
    "the derived dispersion measure distance @xcite is @xmath183.3 kpc , modestly but perhaps not significantly closer than the typical 4 - 6 kpc distance adopted for aql x-1 .",
    "four radio bursts at @xmath191.4 ghz , of half - width @xmath20=2 msec were observed in 13 hours of observing  the least active of the tabulated rrats  with peak fluxes of @xmath21=250 mjy .",
    "if we take @xmath20 to be the light crossing time of the emission region , this implies a source brightness temperature ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath22    this is significantly above the brightness temperature limit for inverse compton scattering ( @xmath23 ) which likely requires a coherent emission mechanism ( for this , and other rrats ) , possibly accompanied by x - ray emission . the historical x - ray coverage of aql x-1 permits study of this field ( although not covering the entire error box of the rrat ) .    in this paper , we report x - ray studies of the field of .",
    "we describe a candidate x - ray counterpart ( ) to the , detected serendipitously in an historical _ chandra _ observation of aql x-1 (   [ sec : obs ] ) . in   [ sec : pca ] , we describe a search for msec x - ray bursts from the rrat , deriving the first limit on the x - ray to radio flux ratio for the rrat bursts . in   [ sec : con ] we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "for analyses , we used ciao v3.3 , ftools @xcite , and xspec v11.3.1 @xcite , with common tasks as described .",

    "the @xmath24 fov of these observations rotates on the sky so that , except for an area @xmath25 near , the observations cover different areas of the sky .",
    "the event level=1 data was used for the source search , in addition to the processed event level=2 data , since msec duration x - ray bursting activity could result in pile - up ; events associated with a candidate rrat counterpart may be flagged as cosmic ray events and filtered from the observation data . with a signal - to - noise limit of @xmath26 , we found no sources which appeared in level=1 and not level=2 data in any of 11 _ chandra_/acis - s imaging observations .",

    "a systematic uncertainty of 4% was applied to the spectrum and the absorption was held fixed at = 3.3 cm @xcite .",

    "we find no evidence of coherent pulsations in the 0.0011 - 1.133 hz range , with an upper - limit ( based on the greatest observed power ) of @xmath1542% rms .",
    "the observation is not very sensitive due to the low number of counts .",
    "* bursting activity*. due to the @xmath31 time resolution of the _ chandra _  data , a @xmath27msec burst of ( multiple ) x - rays , such as might accompany the observed radio bursts , could result in instrumental pile - up  in which multiple x - ray photons are counted as a single photon , their photo - electrons summed into a single count , which is assigned a commensurately higher photon energy .",
    "such a count could be flagged as a cosmic ray and removed between the level=1 and 2 data processing ; or it could be assigned a to high pulse invariant ( pi ) channels in the level=1 data and remain in the level=2 data . to investigate @xmath27msec bursting activity of , with this data the high pi channels of the event level=1 observation",
    "were compared to the background .",
    "in a 4  region about the source , event level=1 data contained 109 counts , while the event level=2 contained 100 counts , for 9 counts rejected as cosmic rays . in a 33  region away from the source , event level=1 data contained 860 counts , while event level=2 data contained 247 counts ; this corresponds to an average 90.3 events rejected between level=1 and level=2 data in our source region ",
