    "the purpose of this paper is to give a complete and detailed proof of harer s stability theorem for the homology of the mapping class groups of surfaces , with the best known bound .",

    "the mapping class group of @xmath0 , @xmath3 is the group of components of the orientation preserving diffeomorphism group of @xmath0 , where the diffeomorphisms are assumed to be the identity on the boundary of @xmath0 .",
    "we consider in this paper the homology of these groups .",
    "recall that the homology of a group @xmath4 ( as a group ) equals the homology of its classifying space @xmath5 ( as a space ) , and that the moduli space of riemann surfaces @xmath6 is a model for the classifying space @xmath7 when @xmath8 , and a rational model when @xmath9 , i.e.   @xmath10 when @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "gluing a pair of pants along two or one of its boundary components define inclusions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which induce maps on the mapping class groups @xmath14 by extending diffeomorphisms to be the identity on the added pairs of pants .",
    "note that @xmath15 is injective , with left inverse the map @xmath16 induced by gluing a disc on one of the newly created boundary components .",
    "the main theorem proved in this paper is the following :    [ main ] let @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the map @xmath19 is surjective for @xmath20 and an isomorphism for @xmath21 .",
    "the map @xmath22 is always injective and is an isomorphism @xmath23 .",
    "considering @xmath24 now induced by gluing a disc to the only boundary component of @xmath25 , we also get a stability result for closed surfaces :    [ mainclosed ] the map @xmath26 is surjective for @xmath27 and an isomorphism for @xmath28 .",
    "theorems [ main ] and [ mainclosed ] were first proved by harer in @xcite with a stability bound of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "this was improved to @xmath30 shortly afterwards by ivanov @xcite .",
    "the first complete proof of a @xmath31-range is due to boldsen , though it is based on an earlier unpublished preprint of harer @xcite .",
    "we stated in the above theorems the bounds obtained by randal - williams in @xcite .",
    "these bounds are a slight improvement of @xcite . with our knowledge of the stable homology ( @xcite ,",
    "see also @xcite ) and using recent calculations of morita ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.1 ) , it follows that this last range is best possible for @xmath32 mod 3 , and at most one off the best possible bound otherwise .",
    "harer s stability theorem for mapping class groups of surfaces was inspired by the analogous pre - existing theorem for general linear groups which goes back to quillen and borel ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the general line of argument , due to quillen , is to build for each group in the sequence considered a simplicial complex with an action of the group , so that the stabilizers of simplices are previous groups in the sequence ",
    "the spectral sequence for the action of the group on the simplicial complex decomposes then the homology of the group in terms of the homology of the stabilizers of the action , making an inductive argument possible .",
    "( the mapping class groups of surfaces being a 2-parameter family , we will need here two simplicial complexes for each pair @xmath33 . ) for this argument to work , the simplicial complexes need to be highly connected and showing this high connectivity is the hard part of the proof .",
    "the simplicial complexes we use here are , as in @xcite , two ordered arc complexes ( defined in section  [ ordsect ] ) for surfaces with boundaries , and a disc complex ( defined in section  [ closedsect ] ) for closed surfaces .",
    "the connectivity arguments are a mix of arguments from the papers @xcite .",
    "the stability for mapping class groups of surfaces has been generalized in several directions .",
    "when considering surfaces with punctures , there are two different generalizations .",
    "let @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the mapping class group of a surface of genus @xmath1 , with @xmath36 boundary components and @xmath2 punctures , where the punctures are assumed to be fixed by the mapping classes in the first case , and to be fixed up to permutations in the second case .",
    "theorems  [ main ] and [ mainclosed ] still hold if @xmath37 is replaced by @xmath34 or @xmath35 , that is the maps @xmath38 and @xmath39 defined above are isomorphisms in homology in the same range .",
    "this can be deduced from the unpunctured case by a spectral sequence argument ( see @xcite ) , or by introducing punctures into the proof .",
    "an additional stabilization map can be defined by increasing the number of punctures . for @xmath35 ,",
    "this map induces an isomorphism in homology in a range increasing with the number of punctures ( * ? ? ?",
    "when the surface is a punctured disc , this is arnold s classical stability theorem for braid groups @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are homological stability theorems for spin mapping class groups @xcite , for mapping class groups of non - orientable surfaces @xcite , and more generally for moduli spaces of surfaces with certain tangential structures @xcite . for higher dimensional manifolds , the homology of the mapping class groups of 3-manifolds stabilizes by connected sum and boundary connected sum with another 3-manifold @xcite , and for simply - connected 4-dimensional manifolds , connected sums with @xmath40 gives a stabilization @xcite .",
    "the present volume contains a survey @xcite about the homology of the moduli space of curves , which gives an overview of the computation of the stable homology of mapping class groups , following the work of madsen - weiss and galatius - madsen - tillmann - weiss @xcite .",

    "section  [ closedsect ] takes care of the case of closed surfaces , proving theorem  [ mainclosed ] .",
    "finally , the appendix recalls some facts about simplicial complexes and piecewise linear topology , needed in particular for the connectivity arguments in section  [ connectivity ] .",
