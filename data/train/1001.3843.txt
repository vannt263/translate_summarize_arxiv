    "until the 20th century , total solar eclipses were the only means of observing the hot solar corona .",
    "however , with the invention of the internally - occulted coronagraph by bernard lyot in the 1930s @xcite , the addition of an external occulter @xcite , and the development of an ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer in the 1970s @xcite , a continuous and detailed exploration of coronal plasma physics became possible .",
    "such instruments , combined with spectroscopic diagnostic techniques , have become powerful tools for measuring a wide range of plasma properties in the acceleration regions of solar wind streams and coronal mass ejections ( see , _",
    "e.g. , _ ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "one of the most demanding requirements of a successful coronagraph is the suppression of `` stray light '' scattered from the bright solar disk .",
    "the coronal emission tends to be many orders of magnitude less bright than the emission from the sun s lower atmospheric layers . at a heliocentric distance of two solar radii ( @xmath1 ) ,",
    "the extended corona is approximately @xmath2 times less bright than the disk at visible wavelengths . in the ultraviolet",
    "the corona is relatively brighter , but still is only about @xmath3 ( at h   ly@xmath0 1216  ) to @xmath4 ( at mg   610  ) times the disk intensity .",
    "these numbers correspond to the lowest - intensity regions off the solar limb ( coronal holes ) .",
    "because light rays coming from the disk are separated in angle by only fractions of a degree from the rays coming from the corona , there are many ways that a small fraction of the former can easily contaminate the latter . a key purpose of an efficient coronagraph is to suppress as much of this stray light as possible through the use of re - imaging , occulters , baffles , light traps , and also by making the mirrors as smooth and accurate as possible .",
    "this paper presents a detailed analysis of the stray light properties of the _ ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer _ ( uvcs ) instrument @xcite onboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) spacecraft @xcite . at present , there are only a few published measurements of the stray light properties of uvcs , and many observations have been taken without dedicated stray - light measurements .",
    "thus , there is a need for a model that predicts the stray - light intensities at ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "the dominant source of uvcs stray light has been shown to be diffracted light from the external occulter that is non - specularly scattered by the telescope mirror into the spectrometer entrance slits . described other possible contributions to the stray light and explained how they are controlled .",
    "this paper primarily describes the non - specular scattering from the telescope mirror , which accounts for essentially all of the uvcs stray light background .",
    "the model developed for this paper applies mainly to the ly@xmath0 spectrometer channel of uvcs , which observes the strong h   ly@xmath0 1216  emission line and other spectral lines within a wavelength range of 1100  1361  .",
    "the model also is valid for the o   channel , which is optimized to observe the o   1032 , 1037  doublet , as well as other spectral lines within a wavelength range of 937  1126  in first order .",
    "the redundant ly@xmath0 path of this channel can be used to observe from 1166 to 1272  in first order as well .",
    "the stray - light properties of the uvcs white - light channel ( wlc ) were described by and are not discussed here .    the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 presents an overview of the relevant uvcs optical paths and occulting surfaces .",
    "section 3 describes how much light from the solar disk is diffracted by the uvcs external occulter , and section 4 describes how much of this light enters the spectrometer slit via finite - aperture diffraction and non - specular scattering .",
    "section 5 summarizes how the contributions from a range of locations on the uvcs primary mirror are summed to determine the total stray light intensity .",
    "section 6 presents the results of a calculation for h   ly@xmath0 stray light as a function of the observation height and compares the model predictions with measurements .",
    "section 7 contains a brief summary of the paper and a discussion of the capabilities of future instrumentation .",
    "finally , the appendix describes how the theoretical rates of non - specular scattering were derived separately for the effects of mirror micro - roughness and finite - aperture diffraction .",
    "the uvcs instrument contains three reflecting telescopes that feed two ultraviolet toric - grating spectrometers and one white - light polarimeter @xcite . unlike many other coronagraphs ,",
    "the uvcs occulting surfaces are linear , not circular , so that the incoming rays are well matched to the linear geometry of the spectrometer entrance slit .",
    "rays from the bright solar disk are blocked by an external occulter and enter a sunlight trap , whereas rays from the extended corona are reflected by the primary mirror into the spectrometer slits .",
    "these slits are oriented in the direction tangent to the solar limb .",
    "the coronal images can be positioned on the slit centers in heliocentric radius [ @xmath5 anywhere between about 1.4 and 10 @xmath1 and rotated around the sun in position angle .",
    "the slit length projected on the sky is 40 arcminutes , or approximately 2.5 @xmath1 in the corona , and the slit width can be adjusted to optimize the desired spectral resolution and count rate .",
    "figure [ fig1]a illustrates the geometry for light coming from the extended corona , being reflected by the uvcs primary mirror , and entering the spectrometer slit .",
    "the geometry is the same for the ly@xmath0 and o   channels .",
    "this diagram is not intended to be an accurate schematic of the instrument , however .",
    "we illustrate the mirror as being flat , but we take account of the fact that it focuses coronal light on the slit .",
    "the spatial scales are exaggerated in order to show how the relevant angles and distances are defined below . for example , all angles of reflection and scattering are small ( _ i.e. , _ near normal incidence on the mirror ) , with @xmath6 applying in most cases . because the analysis of this paper is mainly concerned with relative _ departures _ from the specularly reflected ray paths , it is unimportant which of the rays in figure [ fig1 ] is portrayed as exactly normal to the mirror .",
    "the external occulter is shown as the upper - most horizontal surface in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is positioned so that all specular rays from heliocentric distances less than a given distance @xmath7 miss the mirror entirely and are absorbed in the uvcs sunlight trap ( see dashed blue rays ) .",
    "thus , we can only observe the extended corona at radii @xmath8 ( see solid red rays ) .",
    "for uvcs , @xmath9 . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , the horizontal coordinate @xmath10 is measured along the length of the mirror . the origin @xmath11 is defined as the left edge where the ray coming from @xmath7 that just barely misses the external occulter also just barely misses the mirror .    the observation angle @xmath12 , which corresponds to the angular distance between the desired observation height and the rays that just miss the mirror , is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the angle subtended by one solar radius on the sky .",
    "for the mean heliocentric distance of the soho spacecraft , @xmath15 radians @xmath16 . for uvcs",
    ", the external occulter is positioned at a height of @xmath17 cm above the mirror .",
    "the maximum possible region of the mirror that can be illuminated by the corona extends from @xmath11 to @xmath18 .",
    "we can define these two limiting positions as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the area of the mirror exposed to coronal light can be reduced by moving the uvcs internal occulter ( which sits on top of the mirror ) to the left of its default position by a distance @xmath21 .",
    "the default ( `` zero over - occulting '' ) position corresponds exactly to @xmath20 , and most uvcs observations have been made with the internal occulter positioned at @xmath22 mm to the left of @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the so - called `` vignetting function '' of uvcs is defined by the radially increasing mirror area that is filled by coronal rays . for a given observation height",
    ", the unvignetted mirror area spans the distances between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it should also be noted that neither @xmath20 nor @xmath25 can exceed the actual physical size of the mirror in the @xmath10-direction , which for uvcs is 7.2 cm .",
    "the corresponding maximum observation height at which the mirror is `` filled '' is @xmath26 .",
    "parallel rays from an infinite distance are reflected by the mirror and are focused at the slit , which is positioned at @xmath27 cm above the mirror . for the orientation shown in figure",
    "[ fig1]a , the left edge of the slit is fixed in place ( exactly at the focus point ) and the right edge of the slit is the part that opens and closes to achieve a given slit width @xmath28 . in this analysis , all coronal rays  from the coronal region of interest  that are reflected from mirror positions between @xmath29 and @xmath25 are assumed to pass through the slit .",
    "figure [ fig1]b shows the behavior of light that is _ diffracted _ from the edge of the external occulter . from the point of view of geometrical optics ,",
    "these rays all appear to originate approximately at the tip of the external occulter itself ( _ i.e. , _ at a finite distance away from the mirror ) .",
    "thus , these rays are not focused to a point at @xmath30 , but instead are focused at a distance @xmath31 above the mirror , which is given by @xmath32 and @xmath33 cm for uvcs .",
    "note that the specular rays in figure [ fig1]b are nearly all blocked from entering the slit .",
    "the only exception would be the right - most rays that strike the mirror at @xmath34 .",
    "these are eliminated by just a small amount of over - occulting by the internal occulter .",
    "however , the diffracted beams also have substantial energy at non - specular angles , and these are discussed further in section 4 .",
    "the external occulter is the first line of defense against stray - light contamination . in this section ,",
    "we compute how much light is diffracted by the external occulter and falls onto the mirror .",
    "we ignore the diffracted light that does not hit the mirror , but instead strikes other structural components of the instrument where it can undergo multiple reflections before possibly finding its way to the entrance slit .",
    "specifically , we ignore the stray light produced by scattering off the mirror edge and the surface of the internal occulter . these effects can be important at visible wavelengths , but they have been shown to be negligible in the ultraviolet for externally - occulted designs like uvcs ( see , _ e.g. , _ ; ) .",
    "the problem of parallel rays diffracting around an ideal one - dimensional straight edge ( _ i.e. , _ a semi - infinite screen ) is treated in standard textbooks ( _ e.g. , _ ; ) . in practice",
    ", it has been found that serrated , or `` toothed '' edges perform better than ideal straight edges @xcite . in the late 1980s ,",
    "laboratory measurements were made at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory for both straight - edged and serrated occulters , in combination with the _ spartan 201 _ uv coronagraph spectrometer ( see ) .",
    "the laboratory measurements were done with a light source that subtends the same solid angle as the solar disk .",
    "the serrated occulter used on uvcs has symmetric sawtooth - shaped notches ( _ i.e. , _ resembling a repeating triangle waveform ) with a separation of the peaks , parallel to the occulter edge , of 229 @xmath35 m .",
    "the depth of the peaks , perpendicular to the occulter edge , is 267 @xmath35 m .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] illustrates laboratory measurements and theoretical predictions for the reduction in irradiance ( _ i.e. , _ radiative flux ) seen as an observer moves progressively into the occulter s shadow .",
    "this quantity is shown specifically for the h   ly@xmath0 wavelength , and the distance behind the occulter was converted into dimensionless fresnel diffraction coordinates @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the wavelength of interest and @xmath38 is the mirror position that corresponds to rays from the near edge of the solar disk that barely miss the external occulter .",
    "because these rays do not strike the mirror , @xmath38 is negative in our coordinate system , and it is given by @xmath39)$ ] .",
    "thus , all values of @xmath40 that are relevant for uvcs are positive .",
    "we denote the relative irradiance quantity plotted in figure [ fig2 ] as @xmath41 .",
    "the uppermost curve in figure [ fig2 ] corresponds to parallel rays ( _ i.e. , _ from a point - source on the sky at infinite distance ) .",
    "this is given by @xmath42^{2 } +    \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } - s(v ) \\right]^{2 } \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the standard fresnel integrals @xcite .",
    "when observing the sun , this function must be convolved with the finite size of the solar disk on the sky , since the total diffracted light is a combination of beams between the `` near edge '' of the solar disk ( _ i.e. , _ only 0.2 @xmath1 behind the @xmath7 ray that just grazes the left edge of the mirror ) and the `` far edge '' ( up to 2.2 @xmath1 behind the grazing ray ) . for the h   ly@xmath0 emission line ,",
    "we consider the solar disk to be uniformly bright @xcite .",
    "the result of this numerical convolution ( lower solid curve ) agrees very well with the measured data for a straight - edge occulter ( points ) taken with a light source with the same finite solid angle as the sun ( see also ) .",
    "it can also be seen from figure [ fig2 ] that the serrated edge produced a significantly lower amount of diffraction than the straight edge .",
    "the dashed curve corresponding to the serrated edge is denoted @xmath45 .",
    "the laboratory measurements extended up to an occulting distance corresponding to @xmath46 .",
    "uvcs observations made at @xmath47 fall into the range of heights where the laboratory measurements can be applied via interpolation .",
    "however , uvcs observations at larger heights require some degree of extrapolation beyond the measured range .",
    "for example , the largest height of @xmath48 fills the mirror with a range of @xmath40 values between about 5 and 220 .",
    "after some experimentation , we found that a power - law extrapolation curve that scales as @xmath49 best reproduced and continued the slope of the measured data .",
    "used an exponential function which may become lower than the @xmath49 curve at large values of @xmath40 .",
    "thus , our power - law extrapolation may give rise to a slight ( but conservative ) overestimate of the diffraction at large observation heights .",
    "each point on the mirror between @xmath29 and @xmath25 acts as a `` source '' of solar - disk light that has been diffracted by the external occulter .",
    "these specular rays are focused at a point @xmath31 above the mirror , and are blocked by the left - side slit edge .",
    "however , the light is not concentrated all along the ideal specular ray , but instead has a characteristic _ non - specular _ spread that subtends a broader range of solid angle .",
    "thus , there are always non - specular rays from the mirror that are able to pass through the slit .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] illustrates those rays , which are denoted by non - specular angles ranging between @xmath50 and @xmath51 . for a given point [ @xmath10 ] ,",
    "the values of these angles are given by @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath28 is the slit width .",
    "note that for the special case of @xmath55 , some specular rays pass through the slit since @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "of course , for any finite amount of internal over - occulting , these rays never get reflected at all , since we endeavor to keep all rays that reach the mirror at @xmath58 .",
    "the fraction of reflected light that passes non - specularly into the spectrometer slit is computed by summing the effects of two distinct physical processes : _ i _ ) diffraction due to the finite size of the mirror , and _ ii _ ) scattering due to mirror micro - roughness .",
    "the appendix gives a derivation of these two components .",
    "we note that this separation into two parts is an approximation of the full angular distribution of non - specular intensity , which for uvcs is not known with sufficient detail to specify as a single function .",
    "it is useful to specify these two effects separately so that different assumptions about their origin and magnitude can be made without each `` contaminating '' the other .",
    "taking their direct sum may result in an amount of non - specular scattering that is slightly larger than the actual combined effect of these two processes , but this errs on the side of making a conservative overestimate of the stray light .",
    "the combined differential scattering and diffraction can thus be expressed as @xmath59 \\,\\",
    ", ,    \\label{eq : sboth}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the illuminated mirror width , @xmath61 is the non - specular angle measured in the plane of figure [ fig3 ] , @xmath62 is a wing enhancement factor that takes account of deviations from a perfect diffraction aperture , @xmath63 is the root - mean - squared ( r.m.s . )",
    "micro - roughness of the mirror , and @xmath64 is a horizontal coherence length for the mirror s non - ideal surface modulations .",
    "the first term in square brackets above takes account of diffraction due to the mirror s finite size , and the second term accounts for micro - roughness .",
    "equation ( [ eq : sboth ] ) assumes both that the micro - roughness is small compared to the wavelength ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath65 ) and that the non - specular angles are large compared to the angular size of the specular beam ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath66 ) .",
    "we denote the relative fraction of the diffracted solar - disk light on the mirror surface that makes it through the slit as @xmath67 .",
    "this fraction is given by integrating over all non - specular angles between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and @xmath68 note that the integration over the other non - specular angle @xmath69 is discussed in the appendix .",
    "next , it is necessary to compute the total flux that comes from a given location on the mirror and passes through a given part of the slit",
    ". we must take account of the full two - dimensional shape of the slit aperture ; _ i.e. , _ not just the width [ @xmath28 ] but also the height [ @xmath71 of the spatial element of interest ( in the direction normal to the page in figure [ fig1 ] ) . from the point of view of the mirror , the solid angle of the slit",
    "is given by @xmath72 .",
    "the flux of light from the extended corona is thus given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the coronal intensity , in units of erg s@xmath75 @xmath76 sr@xmath75 ( _ i.e. , _ integrated across the spectral line ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath74 is constant over the slit aperture .",
    "the stray light , which began its life as the direct solar - disk intensity @xmath77 , is attenuated by diffraction and non - specular scattering . without this attenuation ,",
    "the flux from the solar disk is given by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the solid angle of the sun in the sky ( essentially @xmath80 ) .",
    "however , because of the finite slit height @xmath81 , only a fraction of this flux would make it through the slit . in the limiting case where the angle subtended by the slit - height direction ( approximately @xmath82 )",
    "is small compared to the solar diameter ( @xmath83 ) , the piece of the solar disk that is `` seen '' through the slit is only a strip with solid angle @xmath84 . in the opposite limit of @xmath85 , then @xmath86 .",
    "the code used to compute the stray light uses an exact expression that bridges these limiting cases , which for @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 for all of the numerical calculations shown below , however , the approximation @xmath84 is reasonably valid .",
    "thus , the fully attenuated stray - light flux is @xmath89    the two fluxes defined above represent power per unit mirror surface area .",
    "the total power , in erg s@xmath75 , that passes through the slit for the two cases is given by integrating over the mirror surface : @xmath90 @xmath91 where the integration over the @xmath92-coordinate ( the mirror dimension out of the page in figure [ fig1 ] ) is trivial because the fluxes are independent of @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath10-coordinate ranges from @xmath29 to @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath92-coordinate ranges from @xmath93 to @xmath94  cm ( the latter being the uvcs mirror height ) .    finally , the `` calibrated '' measurement for stray - light intensity can be constructed .",
    "once the total power quantities defined above are known , the corresponding intensities can be computed simply by dividing either @xmath95 or @xmath96 by the product @xmath97 .",
    "the illuminated mirror area is given by @xmath98 this process is unnecessary for the coronal intensity , since @xmath74 was used in its initial definition [ equation ( [ eq : fcor ] ) ] .",
    "however , the stray - light intensity [ @xmath99 is computed in this way by dividing @xmath96 by @xmath97 directly .",
    "we do not consider any instrumental properties beyond the entrance slit ( _ e.g. , _ efficiencies of the grating and detector ) because they do not distinguish between coronal and stray light .",
    "we implemented the above constraints on ray geometry , external - occulter diffraction , non - specular scattering , and flux calibration into an idl code that predicts the stray - light intensity [ @xmath99 for various configurations of the uvcs instrument .",
    "a standard set of models for the h   ly@xmath0 spectral line was constructed with the geometric parameters given in the previous sections , as well as the following choices for the internal occulter position ( @xmath22 mm ) , slit width ( @xmath100 @xmath35 m ) , and the angular resolution of the spatial element of interest along the slit ( 10 arcseconds , or @xmath101 @xmath35 m on the slit ) .    in the models presented here ,",
    "the two main properties of the mirror that describe its diffraction and non - specular scattering are the r.m.s .   micro - roughness [ @xmath63 ] and the r.m.s .",
    "wavefront error [ @xmath103 .",
    "as described in the appendix , the wavefront error is a single parameter that characterizes the large - scale figure error of the mirror .",
    "this parameter determines the angular width of the specular beam and the enhancement of the large - angle diffraction wing .",
    "the figure error can also be expressed as an effective mirror size @xmath104 , which acts as a large - scale coherence length analogous to the micro - roughness coherence length [ @xmath64 ] .",
    "although no precise measurements of these quantities exist for the uvcs mirrors , there are several reasonable lower and upper bounds that can be applied .",
    "first , a `` best - case '' model can be constructed with the assumption of zero micro - roughness . for @xmath106 ,",
    "the non - specular rays are solely the result of diffraction around the finite aperture of the primary mirror .",
    "the lowest possible level of non - specular intensity is consistent with the diffraction - limited case of no figure error ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "this limit is interesting because it provides a true lower bound on the stray light that can not be improved upon without changing the instrument design .",
    "second , we constructed a model with empirical upper limits on the micro - roughness and figure error .",
    "scattering measurements were made with a helium - neon laser on the mirror eventually chosen for flight as the ly@xmath0 channel primary @xcite .",
    "these measurements were consistent with a value for the r.m.s .   micro - roughness of approximately 20  .",
    "we note that this determination is dependent on a particular numerical model for the scattering properties of mirrors , which has been described by .",
    "nonetheless , we use @xmath108  as an approximate upper limit for the uvcs primary mirrors .",
    "two independent determinations of the spatial coherence lengths of the mirror were found that agree with one another reasonably well :    .",
    "we used the measurements of non - specular scattering to put a limit on the mirror s coherence length .",
    "the large - angle limit of equation ( [ eq : sinha ] ) can be used to show that @xmath109 measurements of @xmath110 were taken at angles [ @xmath111 corresponding to heliocentric distances between 0.95 and 11.3 @xmath1 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath64 for all of these measurements , derived from equation ( [ eq : lamlev ] ) , was found to be 1.36 cm .",
    "this results in a ratio @xmath112 = 5.3 $ ] for the full unvignetted mirror width @xmath113 cm .",
    "another determination of the mirror s performance can be found from the measured uvcs spatial resolution .",
    "the most definitive upper limits on spatial resolution were obtained from in - flight observations of the star @xmath114 leo , made in august 1996 . for h",
    "ly@xmath0 , the measured full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the spatial resolution element was found to be 5.7 arcseconds .",
    "although some fraction of this value may be attributable to other instrumental factors , it is useful to assign it all to the mirror s figure error to obtain an upper limit .",
    "ideally , the fwhm should be converted into an angular half - width [ @xmath115 as defined in the appendix . if the measured profile were a gaussian beam , it would encompass 83.8% of the encircled intensity out to an angular half - width of about 0.8 times the fwhm .",
    "because this is so close to unity , and because its exact shape is unknown , we just use the fwhm itself to assume an upper - limit value of @xmath116 arcseconds .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : thetas ] ) gives @xmath117 cm .",
    "the stellar observations were taken at a heliocentric distance @xmath118 at which the unvignetted mirror width was @xmath119 cm .",
    "the derived ratio @xmath120 was found to be 5.6 .",
    "because the ratios @xmath121 and @xmath120 were found to be in good agreement with one another , we make the tentative assumption that one can treat @xmath64 and @xmath104 roughly interchangeably for this analysis .",
    "thus , we adopt a mean ratio @xmath122 and we use figure [ fig5 ] to give the corresponding wavefront error @xmath123 and wing enhancement ratio @xmath124 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the numerically computed @xmath125 ratios that correspond to the two limiting sets of parameters described above .",
    "the lower - limit set of mirror parameters ( @xmath106 , @xmath126 ) shows the effect of having only diffraction contribute to the stray light .",
    "for the empirical upper - limit parameters ( @xmath127  , @xmath122 ) the micro - roughness contributed roughly half ( 45% ) of the total stray light .",

    "observations of the faint si   1206  emission line  which has no coronal counterpart and is 100% stray light when measured by uvcs  were made in june 1996 ( triangles ) and scaled to the disk intensity of h   ly@xmath0 to obtain the stray - light suppression ratio @xcite .",
    "additional data points obtained from measurements of the c   977  line ( squares ) are also shown .",

    "figure [ fig4 ] does not show data for distances larger than @xmath132 . at these large observation heights ,",
    "the measured stray light is dominated by a roughly constant background .",
    "this background is likely to be the result of several effects , including the dust - scattered f - corona , interstellar line emission ( for h   ly@xmath0 and other lines of neutral species ) , and possibly other sources of instrumental stray light that are negligible at lower heights . in visible - light lyot coronagraphs ,",
    "a constant stray - light background of this kind is often the result of dust particles on the primary mirror @xcite .",
    "however , for the externally - occulted design of uvcs  in which the relatively small primary mirror is never exposed to direct sunlight  the effects of dust have been considered negligible at both visible and ultraviolet wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of uvcs coronal measurements have been made within the range of heights shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "for any given observation height , the intensity of the extended corona can vary by several orders of magnitude .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the mean radial dependence of the intensity of h   ly@xmath0 in polar coronal holes measured during the 1996  1997 minimum of solar activity @xcite .",
