    "a well - known conjecture in the theory of random walk on a group asserts that for the random walk on the symmetric group generated by all permutations of a common cycle structure , the mixing time of the walk depends only on the number of fixed points .",

    "the formal conjecture seems to have first appeared in @xcite .",

    "we give the second moment method proof in appendix [ lower_bound_appendix ] .",
    "since the initial work of diaconis and shahshahani , conjecture [ main_conjecture ] has received quite a bit of attention , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for cases of conjugacy classes with finite numbers of non - fixed points .",

    "see @xcite and @xcite for broader perspective .",
    "recently berestycki , schramm and zeitouni @xcite have established the conjecture for any set of @xmath1 cycles with @xmath1 fixed as @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , they assert that their analysis will go through to treat the case of any conjugacy class having bounded total length of non - trivial cycles , and may cover the case when the total cycle length grows like @xmath26 , although they state that they have not checked carefully the uniformity in @xmath1 with respect to @xmath25 .",

    "[ main_theorem ] conjecture [ main_conjecture ] holds when @xmath27 is the conjugacy class of all @xmath1 cycles with @xmath1 permitted to be any function of @xmath25 that satisfies @xmath28 as @xmath4 . if @xmath29 then the conclusion of conjecture [ main_conjecture ] remains valid when @xmath30 is any function satisfying @xmath31 .    when @xmath29 the window @xmath32 is essentially best possible .    as remarked above , the lower bound",
    "was already known .",
    "prior to @xcite , which is purely combinatorial , all approaches to conjecture [ main_conjecture ] have followed the work of diaconis and shahshahani in passing through bounds for characters on the symmetric group .",
    "we return to this previous approach ; in particular , we give an asymptotic evaluation of character ratios at a @xmath1 cycle for many representations , in the range @xmath33 .",
    "the asymptotic formula appears to be new when @xmath34 , see @xcite for the smaller cases .",
    "a precise statement of our result appears in section [ s_n_char_theory_section ] , after we introduce the necessary notation .",
    "the basis for our argument is an old formula of frobenius @xcite , which gives the value of a character of the symmetric group evaluated at a @xmath1 cycle as a contour integral of a certain rational function , characterized by the cycle and the representation . in the special case of a transposition",
    "this formula was already used by diaconis and shahshahani .",
    "previous authors in attempting to extend the result of @xcite had also used frobenius formula , but they had attempted to estimate the sum of residues of the function directly , which entails significant difficulties since nearby residues of the function are unstable once the cycle length @xmath1 becomes somewhat large .",
    "we avoid these difficulties by estimating the integral itself rather than the residues in most situations .",
    "in doing so , a certain regularity of the character values becomes evident .",
    "for instance , while nearby residues appear irregular , by grouping clumps of poles inside a common integral we are able to show that the ` amortized ' contribution of any pole is slowly varying .    it may be initially surprising that our analysis becomes greatly simplified as @xmath1 grows .",
    "for instance , once @xmath1 is larger than a sufficiently large constant times @xmath35 , essentially trivial bounds for the contour integral suffice , and the greatest part of the analysis goes into showing that our method can handle the handful of small cases which had been treated previously using the character approach .",
    "a similar feature occurs in the related paper @xcite where a contour integral is also used to bound character ratios at rotations on the orthogonal group .",
    "it seems that the contour method works best when there is significant oscillation in the sum of residues , but is difficult to use in the cases where the residues are generally positive .    in appendix [ contour_appendix ]",
    "we show that frobenius formula has a natural generalization to other conjugacy classes on the symmetric group , but with increasing complexity , since one contour integration enters for each non - trivial cycle .",
    "the analysis here applies more broadly than to just the class of @xmath1 cycles , but we have not pushed the method to its limit because it seems that some new ideas are needed to obtain the full conjecture [ main_conjecture ] when the number of small cycles in the cycle decomposition becomes large . from our point of view , the classes containing @xmath36 2-cycles would appear to pose the greatest difficulty .",
    "we remark that , as typical in the character ratio approach , our upper bound is a consequence of a corresponding upper bound for the walk in @xmath37 , so that our result gives a broader set of markov chains on @xmath0 to which one can apply the comparison techniques of @xcite .    regarding notation , it will occasionally be convenient to use the vinogradov notation @xmath38 , with the same meaning as @xmath39 .",
    "the implicit constants in notation of both types should be assumed to vary from line to line .",
