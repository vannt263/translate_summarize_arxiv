    "control problems for wheeled robots are usually described by nonholonomic systems .",
    "a nonholonomic system arises when the dimension of configuration space is greater than the dimension of control . here and below",
    ", the configuration space represents possible positions of a wheeled robot , i.e. , for a car - like robot it can be expressed in the following way : @xmath0 where @xmath1 corresponds to the reference point of the robot on a plane and @xmath2 corresponds to the orientation of the robot . for nonholonomic systems , motion in some directions is infinitesimally prohibited , but it is locally and globally possible ( through complex maneuvers of the system ) .",
    "there is a well - known problem about parking of a car which can not move in a direction perpendicular to the direction of motion of the wheels .",
    "in fact , every driver has faced this problem .",
    "let us consider the simplest case where a car should be parked on an empty parking lot ( a plane ) with no other cars or static obstacles .",
    "it is the classical hypothesis of `` rolling without slipping '' that provides the kinematic model of the car .",
    "the control problem for this model is stated as follows : given a system of differential equations , fixed initial and final positions of the mobile robot and restrictions on one or two dimensional control , one should find a control law and the corresponding trajectory satisfying these conditions .",
    "note that in order to control a real robot , the kinematic model should be derived from a dynamic one .",
    "from a driver s point of view , cars have two controls : the accelerator and the steering wheel .",
    "the position of a rear - wheel drive car can be defined by a vector @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the midpoint of the rear wheels and @xmath5 is the angle of the car orientation which coincides with the direction of the rear wheels .",
    "the direction of the front wheels is not fixed and corresponds to the steering control .",
    "it is possible that each pair of wheels can be reduced to one wheel only .",
    "moreover , if we are not concerned with the direction of the front wheels , the control system for a car - like robot is equivalent to the system for a wheel or a skate  @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 are respectively linear and angular velocities as controls .",
    "note that the mechanical constraint for the steering angle of the front wheels of a car should be reduced to the constraint on @xmath7 .",
    "such a system looks like the kinematic model of a unicycle or a two - driving wheel mobile robot .",
    "however , the dynamical models of these systems are not identical .",
    "the main difference between kinematic models lies in the admissible control domains which should be obtained from dynamical models .",
    "further in the text , a car is identified with a mobile robot .",
    "the problem is to find controls @xmath8 and the corresponding trajectory @xmath9 satisfying system  ( [ sys ] ) with boundary conditions : @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "since such a formulation of the problem has a continuum of solutions in the general case , a cost functional should be added and minimized in order to choose the optimal solution among the family .    the fact that we can choose the coordinate system @xmath12 allows us to always associate the initial position with the origin : @xmath13    further",
    ", the paper considers a number of known approaches to solve the described above problem , which admits different restrictions on the control .",
    "markov is one of the first mathematicians to work on such a problem  @xcite . in 1887",
    ", he studied four problems with application to railroad practice .",
    "the first problem can be formulated geometrically in the following way . given two points @xmath14 in a plane , a positive number @xmath15 and a direction @xmath16 , the problem is to find the shortest smooth path @xmath17 joining @xmath18 and @xmath19 s.t .",
    "@xmath20 is the tangent direction of @xmath17 at the point @xmath18 and the curvature of @xmath17 is bounded everywhere by @xmath21 .",
    "the solution consists of an arc of a circle with radius @xmath15 and a straight segment or of two arcs depending on the position of the point @xmath19 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : skmark ] ) .",
    "such a solution can be applied to parking problem  ( [ sys]),([positions ] ) , provided that the car is moving with a constant speed equal to one and is unable to move on a circle with radius smaller than @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath22 and the direction of the car is of no importance at the desired end state , i.e. , @xmath23 is not fixed .",
    "since the car is moving with the unit velocity , the length minimization is equivalent to the time minimization : @xmath24    other problems from  @xcite involve the condition about the direction at the point @xmath19 , but also have some additional constraints on the curvature and its derivative .        in 1957 ,",
    "l.  dubins  @xcite solved problem  ( [ sys])([timemin ] ) with fixed @xmath23 using geometric methods .",
    "the solution is reduced to selection among 6 variants of smooth connection of arcs and straight segments ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dub ] ) .",
    "this model corresponds to the time - optimal control problem for a car moving with a constant velocity and with bounds on angular velocity .",
    "such a car is called the dubins car .      in 1990 ,",

    "however , the number of variants of shortest paths increases significantly , the worst case providing 68 variants .",
    "optimal trajectories could contain cusp points , i.e. , points where the movement vector of the car changes to the opposite ( see example in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsh ] ) . as in dubins work",
    ", this characterization is done without obstacles .        soon ,",
    "simpler solutions for both models were obtained in  @xcite and in  @xcite via pontryagin s maximum principle  @xcite .",
    "in addition , h.j .",
    "sussmann and g.  tang reduced the sufficient family to 46 canonical paths .    the reeds ",
    "shepp car is small time controllable from everywhere , i.e. , the reachable set of admissible configurations for any small time @xmath26 contains a small neighborhood of an initial point ( see geometric proof in  @xcite ) .",
    "the dubins car is locally controllable , i.e. , it is possible to find a path for the initial and final configurations that are arbitrarily close , but not small time controllable from everywhere , so the length of such a path does not converge to zero .",
    "optimal control for both cars is a piecewise constant function .",
    "both models serve as classical examples of time - optimal problems .",
    "however , another criterion for choosing an optimal solution which minimizes the amount of car maneuvers can be considered . a classic problem from mechanics with such a variational principle",
    "is described below .          in 1744 , l.  euler considered a problem on stationary configurations of an elastic rod  @xcite . given an elastic rod in a plane with fixed endpoints and tangents at the endpoints ; should find the possible profiles of the rod with given boundary conditions .",
    "euler derived differential equations for stationary configurations of a rod and described their possible qualitative types .",
    "these configurations are called euler s elasticae . in 1880 , l.  saalschutz obtained explicit parametrization of the curves  @xcite .",
    "these curves have rich history including max born s work  @xcite on stability of euler s elasticae ( see fig .",

    "in other words , we have system  ( [ sys ] ) with @xmath28 , boundary conditions  ( [ positions ] ) and a cost functional of energy to be minimized @xmath29    one of the solutions to the parking problem of a car can be expressed via the shape of an elastic rod  @xcite , provided the car is moving forwards with a constant linear speed and with no boundary on steering .",
    "time minimization in this case has no solutions ( curves tend to straight segments but can not reach them for general boundary conditions ) .",
    "note that time @xmath30 is fixed in  ( [ inte ] ) and is equal to the length of the corresponding rod .",

    "that being said , the complexity of the parking problem increases significantly for a car with a trailer moving backwards .",
    "a detailed survey on the various control strategies for the backward motion of a mobile robot with trailers can be found in  @xcite .",
