    "these @xmath11-ladders have been used in various contexts such as abstract measure theory ( dobbertin  @xcite ) , lattice theory ( grtzer , lakser , and wehrung  @xcite ) , ring theory ( wehrung  @xcite ) , or general algebra ( rika , tma , and wehrung  @xcite ) . a sample result , established in  @xcite ,",

    "the basic idea of `` ladder proofs '' is always the same : we are given categories  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 together with a functor  @xmath14 and a ` large ' object  @xmath15 of  @xmath13 ( of ` size '  @xmath2 ) , that we wish to represent as  @xmath16 , for some object  @xmath17 in the domain of  @xmath18 .",

    "then , using the existence of a @xmath11-ladder of cardinality  @xmath2 , we can replace the original poset  @xmath21 by that @xmath11-ladder . under `` amalgamation - type '' conditions , this makes it possible to represent each  @xmath20 as some  @xmath22 , with transition morphisms between the  @xmath23s being constructed in such a way that @xmath24 can be defined and @xmath25 .",

    "nevertheless i must reluctantly admit that no potential use of the existence of @xmath26-ladders of cardinality  @xmath0 had been found so far , due to the failure of a certain three - dimensional amalgamation property , of set - theoretical nature , stated in section  10 in wehrung  @xcite , thus making ditor s problem quite ` romantic ' ( and thus , somewhat paradoxically therefore arguably , attractive ) .    however , this situation has been evolving recently . for classes",
