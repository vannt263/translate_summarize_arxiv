    "the nontrivial boundary structure of finite hyperbolic spaces plays an essential role in the analysis of ads space by means of entanglement entropy  @xcite .",
    "the mutual relations among condensed - matter physics , the general theory of relativity , and the conformal field theory ( cft ) enrich the interdisciplinary research , such as ads - cft correspondence  @xcite .    in 2007 , we proposed a way to generalize the corner transfer matrix renormalization group ( ctmrg ) algorithm to a simple hyperbolic surface  @xcite .",
    "the current study extends our recent generalization to arbitrary regular hyperbolic geometry  @xcite , and we focus on the complexity of the boundary effects of hyperbolic lattice geometry . because no satisfactory analytic studies are available yet , we analyze multistate spin models on hyperbolic lattices numerically . in particular , we focus on phase transitions , which require special treatment because of the non - negligible boundary effect , as they have been suppressed thus far .",
    "the ctmrg algorithm enables us to calculate the free energy accurately , including all thermodynamic functions in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the free energy approach of the current work has been chosen because it incorporates all the non - negligible boundary effects of the models on hyperbolic lattices .",
    "the current study is intended to provide complementary and missing information with respect to the boundary effects performed by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "hyperbolic lattice geometry is known for exhibiting strong boundary effects , which prevent the mc simulations from performing sufficiently precise calculations to classify the phase transitions by means of the free energy .",
    "the reason lies in the large fluctuations coming from the rich boundary structure : the boundary size grows exponentially , as the diameter ( the shortest distance from the lattice center to the boundary ) increases linearly .",
    "_ studied the ising model via mc simulations , and they determined the phase transition by gradually contracting a couple of the boundary layers  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to perform a thorough numerical analysis of the multistate spin models by ctmrg with respect to the boundary layers , which are gradually contracted from the entire lattice in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we briefly classify an infinite set of hyperbolic lattices by a pair of two integers @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the multistate potts model on the negatively curved lattice surfaces .",
    "iii  a is devoted to the numerical ctmrg analysis of the first- and second - order phase transitions on square and bethe lattices .",
    "these two lattices are chosen because they are exactly solvable and can serve as the benchmarks for the future studies .",
    "this section can be skipped if the reader is familiar with numerical analysis of phase transitions using thermodynamic functions .",

    "we generalize our study to classify @xmath1-state potts models on regular hyperbolic lattice geometries .",
    "a concise study of the phase transition deeply inside the infinite bulk is given when contracting the infinite number of boundary layers .",
    "a phase - coexistence region is specified as a temperature interval , within which the first - order phase transition can be controlled by varying the magnetic field on the boundary layer .",
    "section  iv is devoted to discussions and concluding remarks .",
    "consider a regular two - dimensional lattice ( a curved surface ) formed by the tessellation of congruent polygons with @xmath2 sides ( referred to as the @xmath2-gons ) , and the coordination number @xmath3 is fixed for the entire lattice .",
    "such a regular lattice can be described by a pair of integers , @xmath0 , known as the schlfli symbol  @xcite .",
    "depending on the choice of the two integers @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the schlfli symbol can describe either euclidean ( flat ) or curved ( spherical or hyperbolic ) lattice geometries .",
    "if the condition @xmath6 holds , only the following three regular euclidean two - dimensional lattices exist : the triangular @xmath7 lattice , the square @xmath8 lattice , and the honeycomb @xmath9 lattice .",
    "the inequality @xmath10 describes five spherically curved lattices of finite size .",
    "however , if @xmath11 , an infinite set of hyperbolic lattice geometries can be constructed by tessellation .",
    "each hyperbolic lattice has a particular constant and negative gaussian curvature , provided that the size of any @xmath2-gon side is identical  @xcite .",
    "although an arbitrary hyperbolic lattice @xmath0 of infinite size forms a negatively curved surface , none of the lattices can be embedded in the three- or finite - dimensional space .",
    "hence , the hausdorff dimension is infinite for an arbitrary hyperbolic lattice @xmath0 , provided that the thermodynamic limit is taken . to visualize the hyperbolic lattice @xmath0 ,",
    "it is useful to project each lattice onto a unitary circle ; this mapping is known as the poincar disk representation  @xcite . in such a representation , the congruent @xmath2-gons ( all of the polygons have an identical size and shape on the entire lattice ) are deformed if displayed graphically on the disk .",
    "the size of the @xmath2-gons decreases toward the circumference of the disk ; the circumference represents the lattice boundary ( in the infinity ) .     in the poincar disk representation .",
    "the entire hyperbolic lattice is composed of @xmath12 concentric layers , where @xmath12 is referred to as the lattice size ( the radius ) , which enumerates the layers from the center outward .",
    "the inner sublattice , the bulk , has @xmath13 sites with the diameter @xmath14 of the layers .",
    "the outer layers , the boundary , are enumerated by @xmath15 and consists of @xmath16 sites.,scaledwidth=49.5% ]    at first we specify the size of the lattice in terms of the radius @xmath12 , which is well - visible if the hyperbolic lattice is graphically represented in the poincar disk .",

    "now it is obvious how the total number of the @xmath2-gons grows exponentially with respect to the linear increase of the radius @xmath12 ( generalization to any hyperbolic lattice @xmath0 is straightforward ) .      to characterize the boundary layers as a hyperbolic lattice",

    "let @xmath23 be the total number of the lattice vertices ( the sites ) for a given diameter @xmath12 . if @xmath24 , the entire lattice can be thought of as a system composed of two parts : the bulk subsystem containing @xmath14 inner layers and the @xmath15 outer boundary layers .",
    "the total number of the sites is an integer function of @xmath12 and is denoted by @xmath25 , which depends on the lattice geometry .",

    "it is instructive to stress that @xmath34 for the three selected lattices , which means that the number of the boundary sites is at least twice as large as the inner @xmath35 sites , even in the thermodynamic limit @xmath29 ( the inset ) . or , to be more specific , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 on the lattices @xmath17 , @xmath28 , and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "this clearly implies that an enormous number of sites lies on the outermost boundary layer , which significantly influence the inner ( bulk ) properties that we study in this paper .",

    "the model is equivalent to the ising model .    for the calculation of the thermodynamic functions , we apply the generalized ctmrg algorithm  @xcite , which has been proven to be a powerful numerical method for classical multistate spin lattice models  @xcite .",
    "the ctmrg is a classical counterpart of the density matrix renormalization group  @xcite .",

    "the effects of the lattice boundaries are strongly suppressed in this type of calculation .",

    ", the phase transition can be extracted from the singularity ( a diverging peak ) of the specific heat , which is proportional to taking the numerical derivative of @xmath77 with respect to temperature .",
    "\\(ii ) the second , and independent way to find the phase transition is to evaluate the free energy of the entire system , and the boundary effects contribute significantly to the free energy .",
    "we have recently derived recursive expressions for the free energy per spin site , @xmath78 for any multistate spin system including the boundary magnetic field @xmath48 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the free energy per site is given in ref .  .",
    "thus , the free energy per spin site ( expressed in the thermodynamic limit ) has the form @xmath79 we can directly use eq .",
