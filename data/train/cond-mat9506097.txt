    "in this paper we build on previous work  @xcite by analysing an unusual bifurcation phenomenon in the theory of noise - activated transitions .",
    "we  study its appearance in the overdamped limit of two - dimensional double well systems , with nongradient dynamics . in  this context , the new phenomenon is a bifurcation of the most probable transition path ( in  the limit of weak noise ) between the two wells , as  a system parameter is varied .    in many ways ,",
    "the behavior of a system whose most probable transition path is just beginning to bifurcate resembles that of a system undergoing a _ phase transition_. in  particular , double well systems which are ` at  criticality ' in  the bifurcation sense will exhibit non - arrhenius behavior .",
    "this means that the growth of the mean time between inter - well fluctuations , _",
    "i.e. _ , the growth of the mean time needed for the system to hop from one well to the other , will _ not be pure exponential _ in the weak - noise limit . in  double well systems at  criticality , relaxation due to activation will proceed ( in  the limit of weak noise ) at an anomalous , in  fact anomalously large ,  rate .    to  treat the previously unnoticed phenomenon of bifurcation , we  need to develop a new approach for treating transitions induced by weak noise , when a ` soft mode ' appears in the dynamics of transverse fluctuations around the most probable transition path .",
    "since this is analogous to a phase transition , we  introduce a  _ scaling theory_. in  the context of double well systems , our scaling theory is a theory of behavior near the saddle point between the two wells , since the saddle is where the most probable inter - well transition path begins to bifurcate .",
    "we  shall demonstrate that the theory explains the weak - noise behavior , at  criticality , of a large universality class of double well systems .",
    "the scaling theory will reveal a striking feature of the bifurcation phenomenon , which is that in any ` critical ' double well system there appears ( in  the weak - noise limit ) a  _ nongeneric singularity _ in the stationary probability distribution , located at the saddle point .",
    "as  berry  @xcite discusses , a  singularity is nongeneric if it arises , in an appropriate wkb sense , from a catastrophe of unusual type ; _ i.e. _ , one of _",
    "infinite codimension_. the stationary distribution near the saddle point is described , in the limit of weak noise , by an unusual ( non - canonical ) diffraction function .",
    "the familiar special functions of wkb theory ( airy functions , pearcey functions ,  etc . )  do not suffice .",
    "the singularity at the saddle , and the diffraction function with which it  is ` clothed , ' can be viewed as the mathematical source of the non - arrhenius weak - noise asymptotics .",
    "we begin with three largely qualitative sections . in section  [ sec : prelims ]",
    "we review the physical relevance of overdamped models with non - gradient dynamics , and in section  [ sec : doublewell ] explain how the weak - noise behavior of any double well model of this type is determined by its flow field of _ instanton trajectories _",
    "( most  probable fluctuational paths ) . in  section  [ sec : bifurcation ]",
    "we sketch the gross features of the bifurcation phenomenon , including features such as further bifurcations and universality . in  section  [ sec : mae ] , our treatment becomes more quantitative .",
    "we  first review the matched asymptotic approximations technique we  have employed elsewhere  @xcite , and begin extending  it to handle models with singularities . in  section  [ subsec : mae25 ] we explain why the bifurcation transition deserves to be called a phase transition . in  particular , we explain how behavior near criticality is described by _ critical exponents _ , which characterize the rate of divergence of measurable quantities ( _ e.g. _ ,  the pre - exponential factor in the weak - noise asymptotics of the mean inter - well fluctuation time ) . in  section  [ subsec : mae3 ]",
    "we explain how to determine whether any given double well model is ` critical . '",
    "the _ transverse jacobi operator _ is the differential operator appearing in the second variation of the onsager - machlup action functional , when one varies about the most probable inter - well transition path .",
    "the onset of bifurcation occurs when this operator acquires a zero eigenvalue .",
    "in  section  [ sec : maslov ] we explain the use we shall make of maslov s geometric theory of wave asymptotics  @xcite . in  section  [ sec : real ] we introduce the concept of a scaling theory , by developing a scaling theory of weak - noise behavior near generic ( cusp ) singularities .",
    "we  show how the scaling theory justifies the ginzburg - landau approximation used in this context by dykman _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite . in  section  [ sec : nascent ] we develop an analogous scaling theory for the nongeneric singularity associated with the onset of bifurcation .",
    "we  compare our theory with numerical data , and examine its predictions for non - arrhenius behavior and the stationary distribution near the saddle point .",
    "in  section  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss our results .",
    "the reader may wish to glance ahead at fig .",
    "[ fig : arrhenius ] , which is an arrhenius plot of the inter - well hopping rate of any double well system at  criticality . the non - arrhenius behavior shown there , in  particular the ` logarithmic bend",
    ", ' is the key result of this paper .",
    "statistical physics and chemical physics include many examples of stochastically perturbed dynamical systems .",
    "it  is often the case that the state of such a system is modelled as a particle moving in an @xmath0-dimensional force field  @xmath1 , and subject to additional random perturbations ( ` noise ' ) .",
    "since our interest is in the modelling of nonequilibrium systems , we  shall not assume ( as  is usually done ) that this force field is conservative .",
    "if  the motion of the particle is isotropically damped , with damping constant  @xmath2 , in  the absence of noise the particle position  @xmath3 would obey the deterministic equation @xmath4 adding a random force @xmath5 yields the langevin equation @xmath6 in physical problems @xmath5 is often modelled as gaussian white noise with amplitude @xmath7 , where @xmath8  is the ambient temperature . in  this case",
    "the associated partial differential equation , which describes the time evolution of the probability density of  @xmath9 and its velocity , is known as the ( forward ) fokker - planck equation .",
    "a case particularly important in applications is the _ overdamped _ , or _",
    "case , when @xmath10 , for @xmath11  the physical time scale . in  this case",
    "the @xmath12 term in  ( [ eq : prelangevin ] ) can be dropped , and the langevin equation becomes first order in time . if  time is rescaled by a factor  @xmath13 ( _ i.e. _ ,  @xmath14 ) , it  may be written in the normalized form @xmath15 here @xmath16 is a standard @xmath0-dimensional gaussian white noise ( the derivative of  @xmath17 , a  standard @xmath0-dimensional wiener process ) , the ` drift field '  @xmath18 equals  @xmath19 , and @xmath20  equals  @xmath21 . the corresponding scalar advection - diffusion equation for the probability density @xmath22 of  @xmath3 , @xmath23 is known as the ( forward ) smoluchowski equation .",
    "it  may be written as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 it  is often necessary to generalize the equation to include the effects of anisotropic damping  @xcite , or state - dependent noise  @xcite . however , in  this paper we consider only overdamped systems whose langevin equation is of the form  ( [ eq : langevin ] ) .",
    "since we do  not require the deterministic forces to be conservative , _ we  do not require  @xmath18 to be a gradient field_. this means that even in stationarity , the system may not display detailed balance .",
    "equivalently , the stationary probability distribution for the system may not be ( in  the traditional sense ) in thermal equilibrium .",
    "attractors of the drift field  @xmath18 , in  particular point attractors , correspond to ` metastable states ' : they are stable states of the underlying deterministic dynamics , but the thermal noise may induce transitions between them . of  great physical interest is the time needed for this to occur .",
    "for example , how long does it  take for the noise in  ( [ eq : langevin ] ) to overcome the drift toward a specified stable point  @xmath26 , and drive the system state  @xmath9 beyond the domain of attraction of  @xmath26 , toward another attractor ?",
    "the study of such noise - activated transitions is known as the _ stochastic exit problem _ , or the _",
    "escape problem_. for general stochastic models only numerical results can be obtained ( see ,  _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "the smoluchowski equation is particularly difficult to handle in the @xmath27 limit .",
    "this is the weak - noise , or low - temperature limit , in  which the mean first passage time ( mfpt )  @xmath28 from @xmath26  to the boundary of its domain of attraction grows exponentially . in  this limit",
    "a single escape path ( the  most probable escape path , or  mpep ) usually dominates .",
    "our approach to the weak - noise limit , which does not rely on a numerical simulation of the smoluchowski equation , will exploit this asymptotic determinism quite heavily .",
    "as in two of our earlier papers on the stochastic exit problem  @xcite , we  shall focus on two - dimensional ` double well ' systems , with smooth drift field @xmath29 of the symmetric form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : drift ] .",

    "there is assumed to be a linearly stable point attractor @xmath35 whose domain of attraction is the entire open right - half plane . by  symmetry , its reflection @xmath36 attracts the open left - half plane .",
    "there is also assumed to be a single _ saddle _ , or hyperbolic point , on the @xmath33-axis separatrix between the two domains of attraction .",
    "it  must be at the origin , by  symmetry .",
    "nongradient drift fields with this topology arise in statistical and chemical physics , and also in theoretical biology , _ e.g. _ ,  in stochastic competition models of population dynamics  @xcite .",
    "one expects that as  @xmath27 , exit from either of the two domains of attraction will occur preferentially over the saddle .",
    "the drift field  @xmath37 is assumed to have a nondegenerate linearization at the saddle .",
    "so  @xmath38 , and  @xmath39 .",
    "we  shall see that the character of the abovementioned bifurcation phenomenon depends strongly on the quotient  @xmath40 .",
    "= 3.5 in    a typical ( and not necessarily gradient ) symmetric double well drift field , which we have used elsewhere for purposes of illustration and shall examine further below , is @xmath41 in which @xmath42  appears as a parameter .",
    "we  shall call this drift field the ` standard ' double well model . for any choice of  @xmath43 ,",

    "if  this is the case , the drift from the saddle toward  @xmath26 ` softens ' as one moves away from the @xmath32-axis .",

    "this is analogous to assuming that thermodynamic surfaces are real analytic , and that non - analyticities in thermodynamic behavior ( _ i.e. _ ,  phase transitions ) can be transformed away by working in  terms of the appropriate thermodynamic potential .",
    "equivalently , it  is analogous to assuming that all phase transitions have classical critical exponents .",
    "our scaling theory makes it  clear that the nascent cusp singularity is a genuine _ point of non - smoothness _ of the lagrangian manifold . in  thermodynamic terms",
    ", it  has nonclassical , indeed continuously varying , critical exponents .    applying the maslov - wkb method to the nascent cusp yielded several interesting predictions , which we summed  up in the four bulleted items at the end of the last section .",
    "one normally expects that in a double well system perturbed by weak noise of strength  @xmath79 , the rate of inter - well hopping @xmath841 will be asymptotic to a _ constant _ multiple of the arrhenius factor @xmath846 , where @xmath250  is an effective barrier height .",
    "also , one expects that the distribution of exit locations ( from either well ) will asymptotically become a gaussian of @xmath798 standard deviation , centered on the saddle point between the two wells .",
    "the maslov - wkb method predicts that at  criticality , both these phenomena are strongly altered . in  particular , the factor @xmath846 must be replaced by @xmath847 , where @xmath848 is the singularity index of the nascent cusp .",
    "( as  we noted in section  [ subsec : mae25 ] , the singularity index is a sort of critical exponent . ) in  fig .  [",
    "fig : arrhenius ] we sketch an arrhenius plot , showing this anomalous ( non - arrhenius ) behavior .      in mathematical terms , the nascent cusp appearing at the onset of bifurcation is a _ nongeneric _",
    "singularity , _",
    "i.e. _ , a  singularity different from any of the now classical singularities of catastrophe theory . as  shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nascent ] , in  many double well models it  induces an unusual caustic in the flow field of instanton trajectories .",
    "this caustic is itself nongeneric , in  that its exponent is not equal to  @xmath127 . as  we have seen ( see ,  _",
    "e.g. _ , fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis ] ) , its  presence quantitatively confirms the validity of our scaling theory .",
    "it  is remarkable that such nongeneric phenomena are a _",
    "generic _ feature of singly parametrized symmetric double  well models .    at  least",
    "as developed in this paper , our scaling theory is a scaling theory of weak - noise behavior near the nascent cusp , precisely at  criticality",
    ". it  would be useful to treat as  well models that are nearly critical , but not exactly  so . such models should display a crossover from non - arrhenius behavior to arrhenius behavior at sufficiently weak noise strength . by  developing a _ joint scaling theory _",
    ", one  of the variables in  which measures the distance from criticality , it  should be possible to analyse this phenomenon .",
    "we  expect that it is possible to derive a ` ginzburg criterion '  @xcite , expressing how  close to criticality any given double well model should  be , for the non - arrhenius behavior of fig .",
    "[ fig : arrhenius ] to be visible .",
    "work on  this is under way .",
    "we briefly mention two geometric features of models ` off criticality ' that cry  out for a theoretical explanation .",
    "a  nongeneric caustic appears near the separatrix not  only at  criticality , but in many non - critical models as  well  @xcite .",
    "also , as  criticality is approached ( _ e.g. _ ,  as @xmath106 in the standard model of  ( [ eq : standard ] ) ) , it  frequently happens that the nascent cusp is formed by a collision of two generic cusps , which move along the separatrix toward the saddle point .",
    "these phenomena can presumably be explained by an appropriate _ joint unfolding _ , but that is for the future .",
    "we close by mentioning a possible extension of a more theoretical  sort . in  this paper",
    "we have focused exclusively on the asymptotic solutions of the time - independent weak - noise smoluchowski equation .",
    "there is reason to believe that nongeneric singularities resembling the nascent cusp can occur , and are perhaps even widespread , in  the asymptotic solutions of other singularly perturbed elliptic partial differential equations .",
    "most wkb treatments of singularly perturbed elliptic pde s ( see ,  _",
    "e.g. _ , duistermaat  @xcite ) assume that each wkb characteristic ( _ i.e. _ ,  instanton trajectory ) eventually leaves any bounded region of space .",
    "this assumption is violated in the smoluchowski equation for any double  well model , since the mpep(s ) terminate on the saddle point , rather than extending to infinity .",
    "we  expect that when it is violated in other pde s , analogous nongeneric singularities in formal asymptotic solutions can occur .",
    "the nongeneric singular phenomena that we have seen in this paper may simply be representatives of a larger class .",
