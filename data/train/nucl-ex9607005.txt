    "more than half a century after its discovery @xcite , the study of fission is still of general interest .",
    "while the availability of relativistic heavy ions has enabled the study of several aspects of the fission process in the high energy region @xcite , it has been shown recently that a new approach @xcite to investigate excitation functions of low energy , light particle induced fission allows for the model independent extraction of fundamental quantities of the fission process , like fission barriers , shell effects , and the much discussed fission delay time ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    from early studies it is well known that the fission excitation functions vary dramatically from nucleus to nucleus over the periodic table @xcite :",
    "some of the differences can be understood in terms of a changing liquid - drop fission barrier with the fissility parameter , others are due to to strong shell effects which occur e.g. in the neighborhood of the double magic numbers @xmath1=82 and @xmath2=126 .",
    "further effects may be associated with pairing and the angular momentum dependence of the fission barrier @xcite .",
    "fission rates have been calculated most often on the basis of the transition state method introduced by wigner @xcite , and applied to fission by bohr and wheeler @xcite .",
    "the success of this method has prompted attempts to justify its validity in a more fundamental way , and to identify regimes in which deviations might be expected .",
    "recent publications claim the failure of the transition state rates to account for the measured amounts of prescission neutrons or @xmath3-rays in relatively heavy fissioning systems @xcite . this alleged failure has been attributed to the transient time necessary for the so - called slow fission mode to attain its stationary decay rate @xcite .",
    "the larger this fission delay time , the more favorably neutron decay competes with the fission process .",
    "this leads to an effective fission probability smaller than predicted by the bohr - wheeler formula .",
    "the experimental methods of these studies , however , suffer from two difficulties : first they require a possibly large correction for post - saddle , but pre - scission emission ; second , they are indirect methods since they do not directly determine the fission probability .",
    "the measured prescission particles can be emitted either before the system reaches the saddle point , or during the descent from saddle to scission . only from the anomalies in the first component ,",
    "would deviations of the fission rate from its transition state value be expected .",
    "the experimental separation of the two contributions , however , is fraught with difficulties which make the evidence ambiguous .",
    "it seems therefore desirable to search for transient time effects by directly measuring the fission probability and its energy dependence against the predictions of the transient state method for a large number of systems and over a broad energy range .    in the last few decades ,",
    "several studies have investigated heavy ion and high energy light ion induced fission @xcite .",
    "these reactions involve a large and variable deposition of energy , mass and , most important , of angular momentum .",
    "the latter , in particular , greatly affects the fission process and makes comparisons with liquid drop model calculations difficult @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the problem of excessive angular momentum , mass and energy transfer and the associated uncertainties can be minimized by the use of light projectiles and relatively low bombarding energies , see e.g. ref .",
    "have , in particular , measured @xmath4he induced fission excitation functions of several nuclei with masses between 159 and 232 at bombarding energies ranging from 19.1 to 44.5 mev @xcite .",
    "their analysis with statistical fission theory indicates fission barriers which , in contrast to heavy ion induced fission , differ only slightly from liquid drop model predictions .    in a recent letter ,",
    "a new scaling of fission excitation functions based upon the transition state prediction , collapses a large number of fission excitation functions from compound nuclei produced in @xmath5-induced reactions @xcite to a single straight line , once the shell effects are accounted for @xcite .",
    "an investigation of fission delay times gave an upper limit of 3@xmath610@xmath0 seconds .",
    "in this paper , we show the results of a recent experiment investigating @xmath4he induced fission of the compound nuclei @xmath7tl , @xmath8po , and @xmath9at at excitation energies between 25 and 145 mev .",
    "these fissioning systems bracket the closed shell region around @xmath10pb , and due to the strong shell effects , the analysis of these systems represents a sensitive test of the method introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section  [ experiment ] , we present an experimental setup which allows one to measure fission excitation functions for various nuclei efficiently , and we show the results of such a measurement . in the subsequent section ,",
    "we describe the analysis of the fission data and our findings .",

    "the lawrence berkeley national laboratory s 88-inch cyclotron delivered @xmath15he beams with 19 different energies between 21 mev and 135  mev .",
    "the number of energy points was increased to 26 ( see table  [ xs ] ) by using a set of degraders made of aluminum foils with thicknesses between 186 and 433  @xmath13 m which were determined by weighing .    in the past",
    ", these fission reactions have been studied using small solid angle solid state counters or nuclear track detectors , see e.g. ref .",
    "therefore , beamtimes on the order of weeks were necessary to measure complete excitation functions . to cover a large solid angle and , therefore , to minimize beam time",
    ", we performed an experiment using two large area parallel - plate - avalanche counters ( ppacs ) with an active area of 200 x 240 mm@xmath16 each .",
    "the detectors were mounted at 80@xmath17 and 260@xmath17 with respect to the beam axis , allowing for the detection of both fission fragments in coincidence .",
    "the ppacs were placed at a distances of 150  mm from the target to the center of each detector . as the beam energy increases the velocity of the compound nucleus in the laboratory s frame increases , resulting in a decreasing folding angle . since we require the detection of both fission fragments in coincidence , and our detectors",
    "are mounted at a fixed relative angle , the acceptance has a weak dependence on the bombarding energy of the projectile : for our detector setup , we have determined a geometric angular coverage between 18 and 20% for bombarding energies between 135 and 21  mev , respectively .",
    "the ppac s detector volume is divided by a cathode foil made of 2  @xmath13 m thick mylar foil which is set at a voltage of 450 - 550  v during operation .",
    "the readout of the cathode gives a position independent amplitude and time signal . on both sides of the cathode ,",
    "signal wireplanes are mounted at a distance of 3  mm , one with horizontal and the other one with vertical oriented wires .",
    "the wires have a thickness of 20  @xmath13 m , the distance between the individual wires is 1  mm .",
    "five wires are combined to a group which is read out by a delay line to reconstruct the position of the particle .",
    "an intrinsic resolution of 1.0  mm ( fwhm ) has been achieved in both horizontal and vertical position which allows for the measurement of the folding angle precisely .",
    "each detector has an entrance window made of mylar foil which separates the gas atmosphere in the detector from the chamber vacuum . in the present experiment ,",
    "the counters were operated by flowing isobutane gas at a constant pressure of 4  mbar .    in fig .",
    "[ amp ] , we show a typical experimental amplitude spectrum for coincidence events .",
    "it shows that the fission peak is clearly visible and the background is negligible .",

    "once these shell effects are accounted for , no deviation from the transition state rate is observed .",
    "furthermore , the shell effects can be determined directly from the experimental data by using the above described procedure .",
    "finally , plotting the reduced fission rate @xmath86 allows one to look for evidence of fission delay times as they have been discussed in a series of papers .",
