    "the discovery of the first pulsar in 1967 by bell and hewish @xcite gave birth to pulsar astronomy .",
    "pulsars are believed to be rapidly - rotating , compact neutron stars that possess strong magnetic , electric , and gravitational fields @xcite .",
    "they emit radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum , including radio , optical , x - ray , and @xmath0-rays @xcite .",
    "since the launch of the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ in june 2008 , over 150 @xmath0-ray pulsars have been detected , of which the crab and vela pulsars are the brightest sources .",
    "_ fermi _ consists of two parts including the large area telescope ( lat ) and the gamma - ray burst monitor .",
    "the lat measures @xmath0-rays in the energy range between 20 mev and 300 gev @xcite . over the past six years ,",
    "_ fermi _ has released two pulsar catalogues , both describing the light curve profiles and spectral characteristics of @xmath0-ray pulsars @xcite .",
    "the light curves show great variety in profile shape , and may be divided into three general classes based on the relative phase differences between the radio and @xmath0-ray pulses @xcite .",
    "the light curves also show energy - dependent behaviour .",
    "most of the young and millisecond pulsars exhibit two @xmath0-ray peaks whereas some pulsars including vela display three peaks @xcite .     a schematic representation of the different geometric pulsar models .",
    "the pc model extends from the neutron star surface up to low - altitudes above the surface ( yellow region ) .",
    "the tpc emission region ( curved magenta lines ) extends from @xmath2 ( neutron star radius ) up to the light cylinder @xmath3 ( where corotation speed equals the speed of light , vertical lines ) , the og region ( cyan regions ) from @xmath4 ( the null charge surface , where the goldreich - julian charge density @xmath5 @xcite , indicated by the dark blue lines ) up to the @xmath3 , and the pspc from @xmath2 to the @xmath3 , covering the full open volume region . adapted from @xcite . ]",
    "models of pulsar geometry are characterised by the inclination angle ( @xmath6 ) between the rotation ( @xmath7 ) and magnetic ( @xmath8 ) axes , the observer s viewing angle ( @xmath9 ) between the rotation axis and the observer s line of sight , and the impact angle ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "geometric models assume the presence of several ` gap regions ' in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "these are defined as regions where particle acceleration and emission take place .",
    "these geometric models include the two - pole caustic ( tpc ) @xcite ( the slot gap ( sg ) @xcite model may be its physical representation ) , outer gap ( og ) @xcite , and pair - starved polar cap ( pspc ) model @xcite .",
    "all of these models are represented in figure  [ models ] .",
    "the emissivity @xmath11 of high - energy photons within this gap region is assumed to be uniform in the corotating frame for geometric models ( for physical models the @xmath11 changes with radial distance when an electric field is assumed ) .",
    "since the @xmath0-rays are expected to be emitted tangentially to the local magnetic field in the corotating frame @xcite , the assumed magnetic field geometry is very important with respect to the predicted light curves .",
    "several magnetospheric structures have been studied , including the static dipole field @xcite , the retarded vacuum dipole field ( rvd ) @xcite and the offset - dipole @xmath1-field . the latter is motivated by the fact that retardation of the @xmath1-field at the light cylinder causes offset of the polar caps ( pcs ) , always toward the trailing edge of the pc ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "the offset is characterised by parameters epsilon ( @xmath13 ) and magnetic azimuthal angle ( @xmath14 ) which represents a shift of the pc away from the magnetic axis , with @xmath15 corresponding to the static - dipole case .",
    "in this paper we studied the effect of using different combinations of magnetospheric structures , geometric models , and model parameters on @xmath0-ray light curves . in section",
    "[ section : review ] we discuss the implementation of an offset - dipole solution and associated electric field .",
    "section  [ section : matching ] describes how we matched limiting cases of the low - altitude and high - altitude @xmath16-fields using a matching parameter @xmath17 . in section  [ section : fits ] we describe the chi - squared ( @xmath18 ) method we used to search for best - fit light curves .",
    "our results are given in section  [ section : results ] and the conclusions follow in section  [ section : conclusions ] .",
    "we implemented @xcite an offset - dipole magnetic field @xcite into an existing geometric pulsar modelling code @xcite which already includes static and rvd fields .",
    "the implementation involves a transformation of the @xmath1-field from spherical to cartesian coordinates , rotating both the @xmath1-field components and its cartesian frame through an angle @xmath19 , thereby transforming the @xmath1-field from the magnetic frame ( @xmath20 ) to the rotational frame ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we extended the range of @xmath13 for which we could solve the pc rim ( for details , see @xcite ) by enlarging the colatitude range thought to contain the last open field line ( tangent to @xmath3 , see figure  [ models ] ) .",
    "it is important to take the accelerating @xmath16-field into account ( in a physical model ) when such expressions are available , since this will modulate the @xmath11 in the gap ( as opposed to geometric models where we just assume constant @xmath11 at all altitudes ) .",
    "we use analytic expressions @xcite for a low - altitude and high - altitude sg @xmath16-field in an offset - dipole magnetic geometry .",
    "these are matched at a critical scaled radius @xmath22 to obtain a general @xmath16-field valid for all altitudes @xcite . in previous work we chose @xmath23 . in this paper",
    "we solve @xmath24 on each field line . using the general @xmath16-field",
    "we could solve the particle transport equation @xcite ( taking only curvature losses into account ) to obtain the particle lorentz factor @xmath0 that is necessary for calculating the curvature emissivity .",
    "we tested several fitting methods in order to select the most suitable one .",
    "we decided to use the standard @xmath18 method .",
    "for each combination of @xmath1-field and geometric model , we calculate @xmath18 for each set of free model parameters @xmath6 , @xmath9 , normalisation ( @xmath25 ) and phase shift ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we assume that for the bright vela pulsar , with a large amount of counts in each bin , the @xmath18 will be gaussian distributed with @xmath27 the number of degrees of freedom . for the standard gaussian distribution ,",
    "assuming very small gaussian errors , the reduced @xmath28 values are very large and therefore we needed to scale the @xmath18 values with the optimal @xmath29 and multiply by @xmath30 .",
    "the scaled @xmath18 is denoted by @xmath31 , and the reduced scaled @xmath18 will have a value of @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we next determined confidence intervals ( 1@xmath33 , 2@xmath33 , and 3@xmath33 ) in ( @xmath6,@xmath9 ) space for these model parameters , using @xmath34 .",
    "we only fitted the @xmath0-ray light curve , because we do not want to bias our results with a simplistic radio model .",

    "the dark circle in figure  [ atlas1 ] is the non - emitting pc , and the sharp , bright regions are the emission caustics , where radiation is bunched in phase due to relativistic effects .",
