    "more than thirty years after their discovery , indefinite and , more specifically , hyperbolic kac - moody ( km ) algebras remain an unsolved challenge of modern mathematics .",
    "for instance , there is not a single such algebra for which the root multiplicities are known in closed form .",
    "even less is known about the detailed structure of the imaginary root spaces , and a manageable explicit realization analogous to the current algebra realization of affine algebras appears to be beyond reach presently .",
    "( however , there are intriguing hints that a `` physical '' realization might be found in an extension of einstein s theory of general relativity , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "given this lack of knowledge , any new information about these algebras may be of potential value and importance .    in this note",
    "we point out that hyperbolic km algebras possess a very rich structure of nonisomorphic infinite dimensional subalgebras , all of which can be generated by a set of root vectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where certain roots @xmath5 from the root system of the original algebra are taken as new simple roots .",
    "if these roots are real , then the subalgebra can be an indefinite km algebra ; however , we will also exhibit examples where the new simple roots are imaginary , and the resulting subalgebra is a borcherds algebra @xcite .",
    "two subalgebras are said to be @xmath6-equivalent if their respective simple roots are related by a weyl transformation from the weyl group of the original algebra .",
    "geometrically , some of the non-@xmath6-equivalent subalgebras of indefinite km algebras can be understood in terms of conical sections .",
    "generally there are three ways of slicing indefinite ( and hyperbolic ) km algebras corresponding to the intersections of the light - cone with a hyperplane in the dual of the cartan subalgebra . that dual space is equipped with an indefinite bilinear form , @xmath7 , and depending on whether the hyperplane is space - like , light - like or time - like ( meaning that its normal vector , @xmath8 , satisfies @xmath9 , @xmath10 , or @xmath11 ) one obtains elliptic , parabolic or hyperbolic sections corresponding to a decomposition of the original km algebra with respect to a finite , an affine or an indefinite subalgebra .",
    "( the latter need not be hyperbolic , even if the original algebra is hyperbolic . )    previous attempts to understand indefinite km algebras were almost exclusively based on a decomposition into irreducible representations of their affine subalgebras .",
    "( decompositions with respect to finite subalgebras seem to have received scant attention so far . )",
    "although the theory of representations of affine algebras is reasonably well understood , this approach has not yielded much information about the behavior of the algebra `` deep within the light - cone '' .",
    "a complete analysis was carried out up to affine level two in @xcite for the rank 3 hyperbolic algebra , @xmath2 ( also referred to as @xmath12 ) , containing the affine algebra @xmath13 .",
    "this work was generalized in @xcite to the rank 10 hyperbolic km algebra @xmath14 , where the first two levels with respect to the affine subalgebra @xmath15 were analyzed .",
    "this analysis has been extended as far as level 5 for @xmath2 and also carried out for some levels for some other algebras @xcite , but appears rather hopeless as a method for giving all levels .",
    "finally , ddf operators have been used in @xcite to probe some root spaces in detail .",
    "we conclude this introduction with a brief description of the main results in each section . in section 2",
    "we give the necessary background and details about the rank 3 hyperbolic km algebra , @xmath2 , which the most decisive example for understanding the subject . in section 3",
    "we prove the key theorem which identifies a class of subalgebras of km algebras by the choice of a set of positive real roots whose differences are not roots .",
    "we apply that theorem to the algebra @xmath2 to find inside it all simply laced rank 2 hyperbolic km algebras , as well as an infinite series of inequivalent rank 3 indefinite km algebras .",
    "we have generalizations of these results where the role of the algebra @xmath2 is played by an arbitrary rank @xmath16 lorentzian km algebra , @xmath0 , and we find two infinite series of inequivalent indefinite km subalgebras , one series of rank @xmath17 and one series of rank @xmath16 .",
    "in section 4 we go back to the special case of @xmath2 , and exploit the beautiful geometry of its weyl group , @xmath6 , which is the hyperbolic triangle group @xmath18 , through its action on the poincar disk model of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "this allows us to find , in principle , a large class of km subalgebras of @xmath2 which are inequivalent to those already found in section 3 .",
    "a complete classification of such subalgebras is beyond the scope of this paper , but we give a number of representative examples to illustrate the idea .",
    "we also discuss how the geometry of the poincar disk gives information about the generators and relations defining the weyl groups of these subalgebras , and how they are related to the weyl group @xmath6 .",
    "we then use this geometrical picture to relate the weyl groups of the series of rank 3 indefinite subalgebras of @xmath2 found in section 3 to @xmath6 .",
    "( thanks to tadeusz januszkiewicz for suggesting and explaining this geometrical way of finding subgroups of @xmath6 . ) in section 5 we give a method of finding borcherds generalized km algebras inside @xmath2 , inside and lorentzian algebra @xmath0 , and even inside rank 2 hyperbolics .",
    "the canonical example of a hyperbolic km algebra is the rank 3 algebra @xmath2 studied in @xcite , whose cartan matrix is @xmath19 whose simple roots are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and whose dynkin diagram is @xmath23 this algebra is the minimal rank hyperbolic km algebra with both finite and affine km subalgebras . rank 2 hyperbolic km algebras are also quite interesting ( @xcite ) because of their connections with real quadratic fields and hilbert modular forms @xcite .",
    "they have infinitely many @xmath24 subalgebras , infinitely many rank 2 hyperbolic km subalgebras , and our new work shows that they contain borcherds subalgebras as well .",
    "but our main inspiration has been the hyperbolic algebra @xmath2 , which seems to be the simplest such algebra that incorporates all the essential features of higher rank examples .",
    "further evidence that @xmath2 deserves most serious study is that it contains all the symmetric rank 2 hyperbolics , as well as many other rank 3 hyperbolics . from a physicist s point of view , it is attractive because it may appear as a hidden symmetry in ( an extension of ) einstein s theory of gravity in four space - time dimensions ( see @xcite for a review of recent developments and further references ) .",
    "many interesting results about the structure of @xmath2 were obtained in @xcite , as well as a relationship with siegel modular forms of genus 2 , but a complete understanding of the root multiplicities has remained elusive despite considerable further work ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is apparent from the cartan matrix and dynkin diagram that @xmath2 contains an affine subalgebra @xmath25 of type @xmath13 with simple roots @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the approach in @xcite is based on the decomposition @xmath26 with respect to @xmath25 , that is , with respect to the `` level '' which is the value of the central element of @xmath25 .",
    "the feature of @xmath2 which first attracted the attention of ajf was its weyl group , @xmath6 , which is a reflection group @xmath27 isomorphic to the hyperbolic triangle group , @xmath28 and to @xmath29 .",
    "the action of @xmath6 shows that there are infinitely many subalgebras of type @xmath13 inside @xmath2 , corresponding to cusps of the modular group , or to lines of null roots on the light - cone .",
    "however , these lines of null roots are all related by the weyl group , and therefore the corresponding affine subalgebras of @xmath2 are all @xmath6-equivalent .    to give more details , let @xmath30 be the cartan subalgebra of @xmath2 and let @xmath31 be its dual space , which has a basis consisting of the simple roots @xmath32 , and a symmetric bilinear form whose matrix with respect to this basis is the cartan matrix above .",
    "that form is indefinite , and can be very conveniently described as follows . on the space @xmath33 of @xmath34 symmetric real matrices define a bilinear form by @xmath35 so the associated quadratic form is @xmath36 then the root lattice of @xmath2 is isometric to @xmath37 where the entries @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are integers , and the weight lattice of @xmath2 is isometric to @xmath41 where @xmath38 and @xmath40 are integers but @xmath42 .",
    "we make the correspondence explicit by choosing @xmath43 the weyl group action of @xmath44 on @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 and the explicit matrices which represent the three simple reflections are @xmath47 the root system of @xmath2 is @xmath48 which is just the elements @xmath49 of the root lattice for which the norm squared is less than or equal to 2 , @xmath50 . the real roots ( weyl conjugates of the simple roots ) are @xmath51 which lie on a single sheeted hyperboloid .",
    "the light - cone is the set of points @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "all real roots have multiplicity one , and in the case of @xmath2 , the same is true of all roots on the light - cone .",
    "this comes from @xmath25 ( with simple roots @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) whose underlying finite dimensional lie algebra is the rank one lie algebra @xmath54 of type @xmath24 .",
    "any light - cone root , @xmath55 , satisfies @xmath53 and is @xmath6 equivalent to a unique one on level 0 of the form @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "the roots @xmath58 decompose into the disjoint union of positive and negative roots , and we can distinguish these level @xmath59 light - cone roots easily according to whether @xmath38 is negative or positive .",
    "the roots on level 1 are of the form @xmath60 with @xmath61 so @xmath62 .",
    "the affine weyl group of @xmath25 is an infinite dihedral group generated by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and it preserves each level .",
    "each root on level 1 is equivalent by the affine weyl group to one of the form @xmath65 , and because level 1 , @xmath66 , is a single irreducible @xmath25-module ( the basic module ) , the multiplicity of that root is a value of the classical partition function , @xmath67 @xcite . each root on level 2 is equivalent by the affine weyl group to one of the form @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath25-module structure of level 2 is much more subtle , being the antisymmetric tensors in @xmath70 with one irreducible module removed .",
    "if we form a generating function of the level 2 root multiplicities in those two columns , @xmath71 it is remarkable that the first 20 coefficients are again given by the partition function @xmath72 .",
    "the exact formula for that generating function @xmath73 \\left[\\prod_{j\\geq 1 } ( 1 - q^{4j-2})\\right ] \\frac{q^{-3}}{2}\\left [ \\prod_{j\\geq 1 } ( 1 + q^{2j-1 } ) - \\prod_{j\\geq 1 } ( 1 - q^{2j-1 } ) - 2q \\right]\\ ] ] was one of the main results of @xcite , but further work has shown the increasing complexity of higher levels as @xmath25-modules .",
    "there are other ways in which one might naturally decompose @xmath2 , for example , with respect to the finite dimensional subalgebra of type @xmath74 with simple roots @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in that decomposition",
    "the analogue of level of a root @xmath75 would be the coefficient @xmath76 of @xmath22 .",
    "each graded piece of the decomposition would be a finite dimensional @xmath74 module , and it is not hard to use a computer to find the irreducible modules which occur and their multiplicities for quite a few levels has been used in @xcite , and is known up to level @xmath77 ( t.  fischbacher , private communication ) . ] .",
    "the question is whether there is a useful ( recursive ) description of those module multiplicities which sheds more light on the hyperbolic root multiplicities .",
    "the main point of the present contribution is that indefinite km algebras possess infinitely many non - isomorphic subalgebras , which are of indefinite type ( in fact , km subalgebras of equal rank with inequivalent cartan matrices ) . unlike finite or affine subalgebras",
    ", these subalgebras are themselves not yet well understood , but the corresponding decompositions may nevertheless provide valuable new viewpoints .    we will use the following theorem , which allows us to find subalgebras by locating a set of simple roots for the subalgebra within the root system of the larger algebra .",
    "one can not just choose an arbitrary subset of positive roots and declare them to be the simple roots of a subalgebra .",
    "for example ,",
    "if root vectors @xmath78 correspond to simple roots @xmath79 and root vectors @xmath80 correspond to their negatives @xmath81 , then one of the required serre relations , @xmath82 = \\delta_{ij } h_i$ ] could be violated for @xmath83 if @xmath84 were a root of the larger algebra .",

    ".    it would be interesting if one could use the geometry of the tesselated disk to classify the subgroups of the weyl group of @xmath2 and use that to classify the subalgebras coming from theorem [ subrootsys ] .",
    "we would like to finish this section by showing how the series of subalgebras of @xmath2 found at the end of the last section fit into the geometrical point of view given in this section .",
    "when theorem [ rankr2thm ] is applied to @xmath2 , for @xmath123 , the set @xmath198 is @xmath219 so the weyl group @xmath192 is generated by two of the simple generators of @xmath6 , @xmath220 and @xmath64 , along with one other reflection , @xmath221 .",
    "it is not hard to check that @xmath222 which can be seen in figure 1 .",
    "the case of @xmath178 just gives @xmath6 , but when @xmath223 we see that the three reflecting lines enclose a fundamental domain @xmath197 containing three images of @xmath180 , and the angles of the triangle are @xmath182 , @xmath59 and @xmath59 , so in that case @xmath224 is of index 3 in @xmath6 .",
    "but for @xmath165 , the three sides do not form a triangle , and there are infinitely many copies of @xmath180 in their fundamental domain , and the index of @xmath192 in @xmath6 is infinite .",
    "we would also like to mention that @xmath225 is the matrix in @xmath29 which represents the reflection @xmath221 as discussed in section 2 .",
    "although one might have been surprised to find so many inequivalent indefinite km subalgebras in any lorentzian algebra @xmath0 , it is perhaps even more surprising to find borcherds algebras as proper subalgebras in @xmath2 , in any lorentzian algebra @xmath0 , and even in rank 2 hyperbolics .",
    "as is well known , borcherds ( or generalized km ) algebras can be defined in terms of a generalized cartan matrix and a set of generators and relations just like standard km algebras , but are distinguished by the existence of _ imaginary simple roots_. these correspond to zero or negative diagonal entries in the cartan matrix , with corresponding modifications of the serre relations @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "moreover , the multiplicity of a simple imaginary root may be greater than one .    to explain the basic idea let us return to theorem [ rank2thm ] .",
    "as we have seen , for each @xmath118 , the hyperbolic algebra @xmath119 can be embedded into @xmath2 by identifying its two simple roots @xmath226 and @xmath227 in the root system of @xmath2 , and the corresponding simple root generators as multiple commutators of the generators of @xmath2 .",
    "let us also choose the @xmath228 sign to be @xmath229 in the definition of @xmath227 .",
    "the root system of @xmath119 is contained in the linear subspace spanned by @xmath226 and @xmath227 inside the root lattice of @xmath2 .",
    "as we already explained , this subspace gives a hyperbolic section of the light - cone in the root lattice of @xmath2 .",
    "the root space @xmath230 associated with any root @xmath231 in this hyperplane is contained in , but in general will not equal the root space @xmath232 .",
    "rather we will have strict inequality for `` sufficiently imaginary '' roots @xmath231 , viz .",
    "@xmath233 ( actually the difference in dimension of these two root spaces will grow exponentially as @xmath231 is moved deeper into the light - cone . ) as an example , let us take the rank 2 `` fibonacci '' algebra @xmath234 ( so called because of its connection with the fibonacci numbers @xcite ) , and in it the root @xmath235 . then , from the table on page 214 of @xcite , where this root is denoted by @xmath236 , we have @xmath237 on the other hand , with the identification of theorem [ rank2thm ] , we have @xmath238 as a root of @xmath2 . the weyl group reflection",
    "@xmath63 sends @xmath231 to the root @xmath239 which is denoted by @xmath240 in @xcite , page 215 , where the multiplicity of the root is given as @xmath241 , so @xmath242 showing that the root space @xmath232 contains six independent vectors not contained in @xmath243 .",
    "we are thus led to define a new algebra inside @xmath2 , as follows .",
    "let @xmath244 be the set of roots of @xmath2 which are in the plane spanned by @xmath226 and @xmath227 , so they are the same as the roots of @xmath119 .",
    "let @xmath245 be the span of @xmath246 and @xmath247 from theorems [ subrootsys ] and [ rank2thm ] , that is , the cartan subalgebra of @xmath119 . then define the subspace @xmath248 which is a proper lie subalgebra of @xmath2 which contains @xmath119 properly .",
    "the only subtle point involved in checking the closure of @xmath249 under brackets is that @xmath250\\subseteq { { \\mathfrak{h}}}_m$ ] , but this follows immediately from the invariance of the bilinear form on @xmath2 .",
    "we can think of @xmath249 as an extension of @xmath119 in the following way . for @xmath251 , @xmath252 , define the @xmath119-height @xmath253 .",
    "note that this is not the same as the height of @xmath231 as a root of @xmath2 .",
    "define a sequence of extensions , @xmath254 , recursively , beginning with @xmath255 .",
    "for @xmath256 let @xmath254 be the lie algebra containing @xmath257 and the additional generators taken from the complement of @xmath258 in @xmath232 for all @xmath259 with @xmath260 .",
    "this amounts to adding a new imaginary simple root for each such @xmath231 with simple multiplicity @xcite ( not to be confused with the root multiplicity of @xmath231 ) @xmath261 then , we have @xmath262 however , to work out the complete system of imaginary simple roots , their multiplicities , and the associated generalized cartan matrix even for these simple examples would be an extremely difficult task .",
    "this would in particular require full knowledge of the root multiplicities of @xmath2 .",
    "fortunately , this is not necessary because we can invoke the following theorem of borcherds @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "a lie algebra @xmath85 is a borcherds algebra if it has an almost positive definite contravariant form @xmath263 , which means that @xmath85 has the following properties :    1 .",
    "( grading ) @xmath264 with @xmath265 for @xmath266 ; 2 .",
    "( involution ) @xmath85 has an involution @xmath267 which acts as @xmath268 on @xmath269 and maps @xmath270 to @xmath271 ; 3 .",
    "( invariance ) @xmath85 carries a symmetric invariant bilinear form @xmath272 preserved by @xmath267 and such that @xmath273 unless @xmath274 ; 4 .",
    "( positivity ) the contravariant form @xmath275 is positive definite on @xmath270 if @xmath276 .",
    "thus , we have    for all @xmath165 , @xmath249 is a borcherds algebra such that @xmath277    all properties listed in theorem [ thm - b1 ] are satisfied for @xmath249 because they are manifestly true for @xmath2 .    in theorem [ rankr2thm ]",
    "we have seen how any lorentzian km algebra @xmath0 of rank @xmath16 contains an infinite series of inequivalent indefinite km subalgebras , @xmath150 , for @xmath148 .",
    "let @xmath278 be the set of roots of @xmath0 which are in the hyperplane spanned by the simple roots @xmath79 , @xmath151 , of @xmath150 , and let @xmath245 be its cartan subalgebra .",
    "then defining @xmath279 gives a proper lie subalgebra of @xmath0 generalizing the previous construction .    for all @xmath148 , @xmath280 is a borcherds algebra such that @xmath281    let s denote more briefly by @xmath282 any of the  hyperplane borcherds subalgebras \" just constructed inside @xmath0 , and let @xmath283 denote the indefinite km subalgebra properly contained in @xmath282",
    ". then we have the following decomposition @xmath284 where @xmath285 and @xmath286 are supported on positive and negative roots , respectively .",
    "this decomposition corresponds to a similar decomposition found in @xcite for all borcherds algebras , @xmath287 where @xmath288 is an infinite dimensional extension of the cartan subalgebra of the km algebra @xmath283 which makes all the imaginary simple roots linearly independent .",
    "this extension is analogous to the extension of the cartan subalgebra mentioned at the end of the previous section .",
    "but this extension would not be contained in @xmath0 . as shown in @xcite , @xmath285 and @xmath286",
    "are free lie algebras",
    ". it would be interesting to determine their structure as @xmath283-modules .",
    "similar structures were studied in @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to note that there are borcherds algebras inside the rank 2 hyperbolics , and in particular , in @xmath234 , whose positive roots are shown in figure 2 .",
    "note that the positive real roots are shown by open circles and the positive imaginary roots by solid dots .",
    "the figure also shows the simple reflection lines and root multiplicities .",
    "we draw the reader s attention to the central vertical line in the figure , and define the subalgebra @xmath282 which is the direct sum of all the root spaces along that line , including the negative root spaces not shown and the one - dimensional subspace of the cartan subalgebra spanned by @xmath289 .",
    "this is the simplest example of a borcherds algebra embedded inside a hyperbolic km algebra . in this case",
    "we have the decomposition @xmath290 and it would not be hard to determine the number of free generators in the root spaces of @xmath285 by using the formulas in @xcite for the dimensions of graded subspaces in free lie algebras with graded generators .",
