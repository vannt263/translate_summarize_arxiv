    "the understanding of nuclear structure based on the realistic nuclear force is one of the main issue of nuclear physics .",
    "the strong tensor force is a characteristic feature of the nuclear force and is known to play important roles in nuclear structure . in the clustering structure of nuclei ,",
    "the tensor force is believed to be essential .",
    "the reaction matrix ( @xmath2-matrix ) calculation for @xmath0be and @xmath3c adopting molecular orbitals as single - particle states @xcite showed that the starting energies in the @xmath2-matrix equation become smaller when an alpha - clustering structure develops and , as the result , the @xmath2 matrices in the triplet - even channel become more attractive .",
    "this attraction is caused mainly by the tensor force and enhances the alpha - clustering structure .",
    "the argonne - illinois group performed the variational monte carlo and green s function monte carlo calculations with the realistic nuclear force systematically in light nuclei .",
    "they found that @xmath0be has a well - developed two - alpha cluster structure.@xcite in their result a large attraction energy comes from the one - pion - exchange potential .",
    "this result infers the importance of the tensor force in alpha clustering .    for the alpha clustering in the be isotopes",
    ", there are many studies using various models.@xcite they shows the importance of the alpha - clustering structure in the be isotopes .",
    "however , the tensor force is not usually treated explicitly there .",
    "the effect of the tensor force is included implicitly by renormalizing the central and ls parts of effective interactions appropriate to model spaces .",
    "recently , there are attempts that try to treat the tensor force or the pion explicitly by expanding usual model spaces.@xcite we proposed a mean - field - type model ( the charge- and parity - projected hartree - fock ( cpphf ) method ) , which can treat the tensor force explicitly by mixing parities and charge states in single - particle states.@xcite we applied the cpphf method to the alpha particle and found that the tensor correlation can be treated in our method .",
    "because two parities are mixed in a single - particle state , a @xmath1-state component appears in the single - particle wave function in addition to an @xmath4-state component . by performing the parity projection on the total wave function consisting of the single - particle states with parity mixing",
    ", the wave function with 2-particle2-hole correlations ( @xmath5 ) and 4-particle4-hole correlations ( @xmath6 ) is obtained.@xcite the @xmath1-state component is induced by the tensor force in the @xmath7 configuration , which is usually assumed as a wave function of the alpha particle .",
    "the @xmath1-state component corresponds to the @xmath8-state probability and is not treated in usual model calculations explicitly .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath2-matrix calculation in refs .",
    "@xcite , the effect of the @xmath1-state component is included in the @xmath2 matrix as the effective interaction in the model space which essentially consists of the @xmath7 configuration .",
    "therefore it is interesting to study @xmath0be based on the cpphf method .    in the present paper ,",
    "we make an alpha - cluster model using the wave function of the alpha particle calculated by the cpphf method and apply it to @xmath0be to see the effect of the tensor force on the alpha clustering . in section  [ sec : formulation ]",
    "we formulate the alpha - cluster model with the wave function of the alpha particle calculated in the cpphf method and in section  [ sec : result ] we apply it to @xmath0be . in section  [ sec : summary ]",
    "we summarize the paper .",
    "in the present study , the wave function of the alpha particle is calculated with the charge- and parity - projected hartree - fock ( cpphf ) method.@xcite in the cpphf method , the wave function of the alpha particle has the following form , @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is a slater determinant composed of single - particle states with charge and parity mixing and , therefore , does not have a good parity and a definite charge number . to exploit a wave function having a good parity , positive ( @xmath11 ) or negative ( @xmath12 ) , and a definite charge number @xmath13 ,",
    "the parity - projection operator @xmath14 and the charge - projection operator @xmath15 are operated on @xmath10 . in the present study , the wave function of the alpha particle is fixed to the ground state and , then , the parity is positive and @xmath13 is equal to 2 .",
    "the detail of the cpphf method is found in ref .  .",
    "@xmath10 can be thought as a kind of an intrinsic wave function .",
    "assuming the spherical symmetry , the intrinsic wave function can be written as @xmath16 in the above equation , @xmath17 is a radial wave function for the component with the total angular momentum @xmath18 ( @xmath19 for proton and @xmath20 for neutron ) , @xmath21 is an eigenfunction of the total spin @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is an isospin wave function for proton when @xmath24 or for neutron when @xmath25 .",

    "we put two alpha particles which have a finite relative distance .",

    "@xmath40 is the antisymmetrization operator for all 8 particles .",
    "the wave function @xmath38 is not spherical symmetric but deformed axially symmetrically .",
    "then we need to perform the angular momentum projection to obtain a wave function which has a good angular momentum . in principle",
    "we can do such a calculation , but it is too time consuming .",

    "in the present study we assume the intrinsic wave function of the alpha particle as spherical symmetric and , then , the cpphf method can take into account only the coupling between @xmath60 and @xmath61 by the tensor force .",
    "however , the couplings of @xmath60 to @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are found to be also important to gain the attractive energy from the tensor force in the study of the shell - model - type calculation proposed by myo et al.@xcite by considering this , we change the strength of the tensor force by multiplying the @xmath65 part of the tensor force by a numerical factor @xmath66 , which is a dominant part in the tensor force .",
