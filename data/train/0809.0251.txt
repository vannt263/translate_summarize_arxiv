    "in contrast to the problem of controlling deterministic chaos , for which a number of methods have been proposed and successfully applied @xcite , control of noise - induced and noise - mediated motion is a significantly less studied concept .",
    "noise - induced dynamics refers to the case where there are no self - sustained oscillations in the absence of noise .",
    "the deterministic system rests in a stable steady state , e.g.  a stable fixed point , and may be pushed out from it by random fluctuations . on the other hand , in the case of noise - mediated motion ,",
    "the system already exhibits deterministic oscillations . generally , the addition of noise may not only smear - out those oscillations but may also induce qualitatively new structures and dynamics , like coherence resonance @xcite .    the ability to control the properties of noisy oscillations ( both noise - induced and noise - mediated ) is very often of practical relevance",
    "this usually implies the enhancement in the regularity of motion .",
    "however , in some cases , for instance in medical or biological applications , too much regularity is unwanted since it may lead to damaging consequences , e.g.  epilepsy or parkinson s disease @xcite .",
    "previous works have mainly concentrated on the control of stochastic oscillations in low - dimensional simple models @xcite , while control of noise - induced dynamics in spatially extended systems @xcite seems still to be an open problem .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper .",
    "it is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we will introduce the stochastic model of a semiconductor superlattice . in sect .",
    "iii time - delayed feedback control is implemented . in sect .",
    "iv delay - induced spatio - temporal charge dynamics is studied in the absence of noise . sect .",
    "v deals with the time - delayed feedback control of stochastic spatio - temporal dynamics .",
    "we consider a stochastic model for a superlattice @xcite which consists of epitaxial layers of two alternating semiconductor materials with different bandgaps , thus forming a periodic sequence of potential wells and barriers .",
    "the superlattice is a prominent example of a semiconductor nanostructure device which may serve as a practically relevant nonlinear model system @xcite and may find applications as an ultra - high frequency electronic oscillator @xcite .",
    "our model is based on sequential tunneling of electrons @xcite .",
    "the resulting tunneling current density @xmath0 from well @xmath1 to well @xmath2 depends only on the electric field @xmath3 between both wells and the electron densities @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the respective wells ( in units of @xmath6 ) , as given by eqs .",
    "( 83 ) , ( 86 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we simulate numerically a superlattice @xcite of @xmath7 gaas wells of width @xmath8 , and al@xmath9ga@xmath10as barriers of width @xmath11 , doping density @xmath12 and at temperature @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the random fluctuations of the current densities are modelled by additive gaussian white noise @xmath14 with @xmath15 which yields the following langevin equations ( @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the noise intensity @xcite . since the wells in our superlattice model are considered to be weakly coupled and the tunneling times are much smaller than the characteristic time scale of the global current @xmath19 these noise sources can be treated as uncorrelated both in time and space .",
    "charge conservation is automatically guaranteed by adding a noise term @xmath20 to each current density @xmath21 .",
    "the electron densities and the electric fields are coupled by the discrete poisson equation : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the relative and absolute permittivities , @xmath25 is the electron charge and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the fields at the emitter and collector barrier , respectively . in the deterministic case ,",
    "i.e.  at @xmath28 , rich dynamical scenarios can be observed including formation of charge accumulation and depletion fronts associated with field domains bounded by these charge fronts , and with stationary , periodic or even chaotic current oscillations @xcite .",
    "the two control parameters which are crucial for the dynamics , are the applied voltage @xmath29 between emitter and collector , which gives rise to a global constraint : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the superlattice period , and the contact conductivity @xmath32 @xcite . for the current densities at the emitter and collector",
    "we use ohmic boundary conditions , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "time - delayed feedback was originally proposed by pyragas in the context of chaos control @xcite .",
    "the goal of this method is to stabilize unstable periodic orbits ( upos ) by adding , to a chaotic system , a control force in the form of the difference between a system variable at time @xmath35 and its delayed version at time @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 is a delay time and @xmath38 is the feedback strength .",
    "apart from the control of upos the stabilization of unstable fixed points can also be achieved by time - delayed feedback @xcite .",
    "this method proved to be very powerful and has been successfully applied to various physical systems since then @xcite .",
    "other variants have been elaborated , e.g. extended time - delay autosynchronization ( etdas ) @xcite , and have been applied not only to deterministic systems @xcite including fixed points but to stochastic systems as well @xcite .",
    "apart from the deliberate design of feedback control loops to manipulate the intrinsic dynamics , delay arises also naturally in many systems .",
    "typical examples of such systems are lasers where the delay enters through the coupling to external cavities ( optical feedback ) @xcite and neurons , where the signal propagation yields a delay time @xcite .    an easy way to implement control in the superlattice model is to choose the output signal to be the total current density , @xmath39 and simply add the control force to the external voltage @xmath29 , i.e.@xmath40 where @xmath41 is the time - independent external voltage bias and @xmath42 is the total current density , filtered by a low - pass filter , @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the cutoff frequency @xcite .",
    "since both voltage and total current density are externally accessible global variables , such a control scheme is easy to implement experimentally .",
    "the low - pass filter in the current density was introduced initially for the effective control of chaotic motion in the superlattice @xcite . due to the well - to - well hopping of the depletion and accumulation fronts ,",
    "the current is modulated by fast small - amplitude oscillations .",
    "these high - frequency oscillations render the control loop unstable as @xmath45 is fed back to the system and therefore they need to be filtered out .",
    "stochastic oscillations , like chaotic ones , exhibit the same high - frequency oscillations and thus we apply this filter here , too .",
    "in the following , the system is prepared in a stable fixed point corresponding to values of voltage @xmath46 and conductivity @xmath47 .",
    "it corresponds to a stationary accumulation front separating the high - field domain attached to the collector from the low - field domain adjacant to the emitter . besides the stable fixed point ( node ) there exists a saddle - point , whose unstable manifolds are connected to the stable node , forming a closed loop in phase space as depicted schematically in fig.[fig : fig1 ] @xcite .    in this regime",
    "the system is very close to a saddle - node bifurcation on a limit cycle ( saddle - node infinite period bifurcation , _ sniper _ ) . in @xcite",
    "a bifurcation analysis in the @xmath48 plane was performed showing how _ sniper _ bifurcations govern the transition from stationary to moving field domains in the superlattice . in the vicinity of such a bifurcation",
    "the system is excitable @xcite and therefore very sensitive to noise which is able to trigger front motion through the device .",
    "moreover , the phenomenon of coherence resonance @xcite was also confirmed in our model .    in this paper , we will study how time - delayed feedback acts on the system both in the presence and absence of noise . when prepared in the vicinity of a _ sniper _ bifurcation .    in the absence of both delay and noise",
    "the only stable attractor in phase space is the stable node .",
    "regardless of the initial condition , all trajectories end there .",
    "in particular , when selecting the initial condition on one of the two unstable manifolds of the saddle - point , the system performs a long excursion along the invariant circle before ending in the stable node ( fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) . this deterministic path",
    "is affected by the delay for given combinations of the two control parameters , @xmath38 and @xmath37 . by keeping the delay @xmath37 fixed and considering different control amplitudes @xmath38 we track these orbits in phase space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) ( k=0 ) shows a trajectory which closely follows the unstable manifold of the saddle - point ( cross ) and ends in the stable node ( full circle ) , cf .",
    "blow - up in the middle panel .",
    "note that in the chosen 2-dimensional projection of the n - dimensional phase space the invariant circle ( saddle - node loop ) is distorted to a figure - eight shape .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) , during the first few nanoseconds the systems acts as it would in the absence of delay , repelled by the saddle - point .",
    "control is switched on at @xmath49 when the control force begins to act .",
    "the interval @xmath50 $ ] serves as initial condition of the delay equation .",
    "this becomes evident in a `` twist '' in the trajectory just before the orbit reaches the stable node ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) ) . for a moment",
    "it looks as if the system is attracted to the saddle - point instead of the node .",
    "this may be understood as follows : the control force shortly pulls the system off the phase space of the uncontrolled system pushing it towards the stable manifold of the saddle - point . at a critical value @xmath51 ,",
    "the system is indeed `` swallowed '' by the saddle and the trajectory closes in a homoclinic orbit .    in the top panel of figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b )  -  [ fig : fig2](d ) the trajectories for three values of @xmath38 approaching this critical value are shown .    due to the high dimensionality of the system , which is blown up to infinity due to the delay ,",
    "the above mechanism is not clearly demonstrated in a 2-dimensional projection in phase space .",
    "one must zoom in carefully in order to see the deviation from the deterministic path due to delay ( middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "this deviation is even better visible in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] where the final part of the electron density time series of @xmath52 is plotted . in ( a )",
    "the deterministic trajectory is plotted and the thick grey solid and dashed lines mark the position of the stable node and the saddle - point , respectively .",
    "it is clear that , the closer one is to the homoclinic bifurcation ( d ) , the closer to the saddle - point does the system reach and the longer the trajectory remains there , before ending up in the stable node .    beyond the critical value of @xmath53 the homoclinic orbit breaks and a limit cycle",
    "is born . in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a )  -  [ fig : fig3](c ) the time series of the current density for three different values of @xmath38 above @xmath54 are shown .",
    "the period clearly decreases for increasing @xmath38 . plotting it as a function of the control strength we obtain fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ( d ) .",
    "the period @xmath55 shows a characteristic scaling law @xcite , @xmath56 $ ] , shown in the inset .",
    "this law governs another type of global bifurcation , namely the homoclinic bifurcation .",
    "this delay - induced dynamics is in perfect agreement with a generic two - variable model for the _ sniper _ bifurcation , which also exhibits homoclinic bifurations of a limit cycle if delay is added @xcite . here",
    ", however , we have a much more complex spatio - temporal system .",
    "the corresponding space - time plots are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "it is clear that accumulation and depletion fronts corresponding to dipole domains are created at the emitter ( bottom ) , and move through the device . due to the global voltage constraint",
    ", they interact with the additional accumulation front in the middle of the sample , thus forming a tripole oscillation @xcite .     +    following the homoclinic bifurcation in the @xmath38-@xmath37 plane we numerically obtain the regime where control induces limit cycle oscillations .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .    crossing the bifurcation line by increasing either @xmath38 or @xmath37 ,",
    "oscillations are born , whose period decreases with @xmath38 or @xmath37 .",
    "in this section , gaussian white noise is added according to eqs .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) , ( [ sl - equations ] ) . by considering two values of the control strength which lie inside or outside of the regime where delay induces a limit cycle ( fig.[fig : fig5 ] ) ) , we will study the effect of the time delay on noise - mediated and noise - induced oscillations , respectively .",
    "the regularity or coherence of noisy oscillations can be quantified by various measures .",
    "here we use ( i ) the correlation time @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the autocorrelation function of the current density signal @xmath45 , and ( ii ) the normalized fluctuation of pulse durations @xcite : @xmath59 typically used for excitable systems exhibiting oscillations in the form of spike trains with two distinct time scales . these time scales are the _ activation time _ , which is the time needed to excite the system from the stable fixed point and the _ excursion time _ which is the time needed to return from the excited state to the fixed point .",
    "the sum of these two times equals the pulse duration or period of the oscillation @xmath55 , which denotes the time between two spikes and is also known as interspike interval .    by keeping the noise intensity fixed at @xmath60 we first select a value @xmath61 outside the delay - induced limit cycle regime .",
    "this corresponds to the lower dashed horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6](a ) , the correlation time is plotted versus the time delay .",
    "it exhibits a slight modulation with a period close to the period of the noise - induced oscillations @xcite , @xmath62 and reaches minimum values for @xmath63 .",
    "overall , however , it remains close to the control - free value , @xmath64 .    at @xmath65 inside the delay - induced limit cycle regime (",
    "upper dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) , this modulation is much stronger and has a period close to the delay - induced period ( @xmath66 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](d ) ) .",
    "in addition , one can better distinguish between non - optimal and optimal values of @xmath37 at which the correlation time attains maximum values .",
    "this is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ( b ) . for a higher noise intensity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ( c ) , right panel ) the effect is similar but weaker .",
    "next we are interested in how the time scales are affected by the delay .",
    "we express the time scales through the mean interspike interval @xmath67 and look at its dependence upon the time delay @xmath37 for a fixed value of the noise intensity , @xmath60 , and control strength @xmath61 , chosen outside of the delay - induced oscillations regime ( lower dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) . as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ( a ) , @xmath67 is slightly modulated due to the delay with a period close to the noise - induced mean period ( @xmath68 ) @xcite .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ( b ) a value of @xmath38 inside the delay - induced oscillations regime is used , @xmath65 ( upper dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] ) . for @xmath69 ,",
    "the mean interspike interval is equal to the noise - induced period , @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "as the time delay increases , and the delay - induced bifurcation line is crossed , @xmath67 sharply drops to the value of @xmath70 which corresponds to the period induced by the delay ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3](d ) ) . by further increase of @xmath37 ,",
    "@xmath67 rises a little above @xmath71 .",
    "then , for @xmath72 the mean interspike interval decreases again and the same scenario is repeated with a modulation period very close to the delay - induced period .",
    "there is some resemblance to the piecewise linear dependence of @xmath67 upon @xmath37 reported in other excitable systems : the fitzhugh - nagumo model in @xcite and the oregonator model of the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction ( under correlated noise and nonlinear delayed feedback ) in @xcite which , like our system , is also spatially extended .",
    "the difference to our present analysis is that in those models the case of a delay - induced limit cycle was excluded .",
    "an explanation for the entrainment of the time scales by the delayed feedback in case of systems below a hopf bifurcation @xcite was given on the basis of a linear stability analysis .",
    "it was shown that the basic period is proportional to the inverse of the imaginary part of the eigenvalue of the fixed point which itself depends linearly upon @xmath37 , for large time delays .",
    "the effect of noise and delay in excitable systems was also studied analytically in @xcite based on waiting time distributions and renewal theory .",
    "finally we look into the dependence of the correlation time @xmath73 and the normalized fluctuation of the interspike intervals @xmath74 on the noise intensity .",
    "we keep the control strength fixed to the value corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6](b ) ( right panel ) , from which we also select an optimal and a non - optimal value of the time delay and compare the results to the uncontrolled system . in the left and",

    "[ fig : fig7 ] , @xmath74 and @xmath73 are plotted , respectively . the case @xmath75 is shown in fig",
    "[ fig : fig7](a ) for direct comparison .",
    "coherence resonance shows up as a minimum of @xmath74 and a maximum of @xmath73 , respectively . for both non - optimal ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7](b ) ) and optimal @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7](c ) ) , there is an enhancement in the coherence at low noise intensity .",
    "correlation times attain much higher values than those of the uncontrolled system , especially at low noise level .",
    "similarly , the interspike interval fluctuation @xmath74 is much smaller .",
    "in addition , for non - optimal delay time @xmath76 , the effect of coherence resonance is suppressed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7](b ) ) .",
    "the correlation time still shows a small local maximum exactly where the uncontrolled system does , but for small noise intensities the correlation time dramatically increases in a monotonic way to much larger values of @xmath73 . on the other hand , for optimal @xmath77 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7](c ) ) , coherence resonance is maintained and both @xmath73 and @xmath74 show a maximum and minimum , respectively , but at a much lower noise intensity than in the free system .",
    "the comparison between all three cases is better visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7](d ) where the three curves are plotted together .",
    "we have shown that by applying a time - delayed feedback force to a semiconductor superlattice stationary field domains ( bounded by charge accumulation and depletion fronts ) can be transformed into travelling domains in a homoclinic bifurcation of a limit cycle if the system is prepared below a saddle - node infinite period _ sniper _ bifurcation . with the addition of gaussian white noise , control results in a modulation of both the coherence and time scales of the system with the time delay .",
    "the periodicity of this modulation is determined by the competition between the different time scales imposed by noise and control and their dependence on the noise intensity and time - delay , respectively .",
    "we distinguish between optimal and non - optimal time delays at which the coherenc resonance effect is enhanced or destroyed , respectively . in both cases",
    "the correlation times of stochastic domain motion are dramatically increased at low noise intensities .",
