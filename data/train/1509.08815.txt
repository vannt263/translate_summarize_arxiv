    "in recent years , the field of cavity optomechanics has been subjected to rapid exploration in terms of both theory and experiment [ 1 - 6 ] .",
    "the basic principle of coupling through radiation pressure force , as predicted in [ 7 - 9 ] can lead to kerr type nonlinearity between the optical and mechanical modes [ 10 - 11 ] .",
    "the optomechanical interaction between optical and mechanical modes is not only a tool for readout of mechanical motion [ 12 ] , but it also triggers the possibility of observing fundamental quantum effects in mesoscopic systems . owing to the inherent nonlinearity ,",
    "cavity optomechanics is a strong candidate for futuristic aspects of achievement of standard quantum limit [ 13 ] , continuous variable entanglement of optical and mechanical modes [ 14 ] , nonclassical state generation [ 15 ] , quantum state transfer between different modes [ 16 ] , optomechanically induced transparency [ 17 ] , quantum nondemolition measurements [ 18 ] etc .    for observing quantum effects in optomechanical systems ,",
    "ground state cooling of the mechanical oscillator is an essential condition [ 19 , 20 ] . in an optomechanical system ,",
    "the light scattered from the movable end mirror gives rise to stokes and anti - stokes sidebands . during the stokes process",
    ", the mirror absorbs a quantum of energy from the cavity optical field , leading to heating of the mirror ; whereas during the anti - stokes process , the cavity field absorbs energy from the mirror resulting in cooling of the mirror . to obtain an effective cooling of the mechanical mirror , cooling rate should be higher than the heating rate .",
    "therefore , in analogy to the laser cooling of ions in the strong binding regime [ 21 ] , conventional cavity cooling of mechanical oscillators requires the condition of resolved - sideband regime , where the cavity mode decay rate is lower than the mechanical oscillator resonance frequency [ 19 , 22 ] .",
    "however , in practical situations , for typical mechanical oscillators of frequency in the range of khz - mhz ; fulfilling this condition is a challenging task , that poses serious constraints experimentally . to relax this requirement , few different approaches have been suggested such as cooling using dissipative coupling [ 23 - 24 ] , coupling with high - q auxiliary cavity [ 25 ] , hybrid atom- optomechanical systems [ 26 ] , optomechanically induced transparency [ 27 ] . here , in this paper , we consider the cavity cooling of a micromechanical mirror , with a quantum well ( qw ) having lower exciton decay rate , placed inside the optomechanical cavity .",
    "this type of solid - state systems has their own advantages over atomic cavity systems .",
    "engineerable emission frequency , fixed position and potential for integration with cavities and waveguides using developed semiconductor fabrication techniques [ 28 ] make them unique tool for exploring optomechanics further [ 6 , 29 ] .",
    "the same type of systems has been studied in the context of nonlinear effects like bistability and squeezing of the output field [ 30 ] .",
    "it is also predicted in such a system that the interaction between the exciton and mechanical modes through the cavity field may lead to entanglement between the two [ 31 ] .",
    "we explore the aspect of ground state cooling of the mechanical oscillator in the unresolved - sideband regime .    in this regime , by coupling the mechanical oscillator to a quantum well placed at the anti - node of the cavity field",
    ", one can modify the noise spectrum .",
    "this illustrates mode structuring around the sidebands , due to the inhibition of the heating process while enhancing the cooling process through quantum interference . in order to study the cooling process in the mechanical oscillator",
    ", we use an effective exciton - phonon interaction model that is analogous to dark mode formation , which has been studied extensively in optomechanics , in connection to state transfer protocols[32 ] .",
    "the dark mode in optomechanics is similar to coherent - population trapped state or the dark state in atomic physics [ 33 ] .",
    "the similarity to the so - called stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) is also notable .",
    "in fact , stirap protocols are also studied extensively in the context of state transfer in optomechanical and electromechanical systems [ 32 ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the hamiltonian of the system and derive the quantum langevin equations for the system operators .",
    "section iii is devoted to the analysis of cooling of the mechanical oscillator , followed by conclusion of our work in section iv .",

    ", there is an increase in cooling rate while the heating rate is reduced , and for @xmath63 , the opposite happens .",
    "therefore , by tuning the cavity - field detuning , the cooling rate of the mechanical resonator can potentially be enhanced while reducing the heating rate .",
    "this is possible due to the interaction of the high - q qw with the mechanical mode through the cavity field .",
    "intuitively , the asymmetry in cooling and heating rates can be pictured as a outcome of quantum interference . as can be observed from fig . 2 , due to the presence of the exciton - cavity coupling @xmath13",

    "this dark - mode is responsible for an effective cooling [ 32 ] .",
    "it is worth to be noted that in case of a single optomechanical cavity without the qw , cooling occurs in the red detuned regime only .",
    "but , with the qw inside the cavity , the damping is significantly enhanced in the blue - detuned regime as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 . the effective detuning term @xmath91 contains both @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "hence , it is possible to tune these blue - detuned terms to get a red - detuned @xmath91 at high value of @xmath92 , that results in cavity cooling .",

    "for example , for @xmath94 , the maximum tolerable bath phonon number is approximately equal to @xmath95 .",
    "it is also to be noted that more bath phonon number is tolerable for ground state cooling with lower decay rate of the qw excitons .",
    "it is important to have an idea about the optimum range of the optomechanical coupling @xmath96 and the exciton - cavity coupling @xmath13 to be used for efficient mechanical mode cooling .",
    "these couplings are fixed by the material at the fabrication stage . though the optomechanical coupling @xmath96 also depends on the input laser power , it is difficult to tune the couplings at a later stage .",

    "for the stability of the system , the effective coupling must follow @xmath98 , as observed from the quantum limit of cooling .",

    "it is worthwhile to note that such semiconductor structures , with well - developed semiconductor fabrication techniques , are easily integrable with cavities and waveguides making them a unique tool for exploiting optomechanics .",
    "the exciton and mechanical modes are not coupled directly , but their interaction with the cavity optical field gives rise to an indirect coupling between them .",

    "<S> we theoretically demonstrate the ground state cooling of a mechanical oscillator in an optomechanical cavity in presence of a quantum well , in the unresolved - sideband regime . due to the presence of the quantum well </S>",
    "<S> , the cavity response gets modified and leads to asymmetric heating and cooling processes . </S>",
    "<S> the cooling rate of the mechanical resonator can potentially be enhanced by tuning the cavity - field detuning . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that , even when the cavity is in the unresolved - sideband regime , the effective interaction of the exciton and mechanical modes can bring the system back to effective resolved - sideband regime . </S>",
    "<S> time evolution of the mean phonon number in the mechanical resonator is studied using the quantum master equation . </S>",
    "<S> the average phonon occupancy in the mechanical resonator tends to zero with time , exhibiting dynamic controllability of cavity dissipation .    </S>",
