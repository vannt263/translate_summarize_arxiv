    "mo pyrochlore oxides , whose chemical formula is generally given by @xmath3mo@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath6 is rare earth ) , are known to exhibit interesting phase competition and related phenomena . by chemical substitution of @xmath6 cations ,",
    "the system changes from a ferromagnetic metal ( fm ) to a spin - glass ( sg ) insulator systematically depending on the ionic radius of @xmath6 cation  @xcite . on the other hand , in applied external pressure , fm collapses and",
    "turns into a peculiar paramagnetic metal ( pm ) with showing an intermediate sg metallic state , whereas the sg insulator remains rather robust against pressure  @xcite .",
    "this variety of phases and competition among them offer an opportunity to systematically study many fascinating phenomena in strongly correlated electron systems , such as metal - insulator transition and anomalous transport properties  @xcite .    the basic lattice structure of @xmath3mo@xmath4o@xmath5",
    "is composed of two intervening pyrochlore lattices : one is formed by mo cations and the other is by @xmath6 . the pyrochlore lattice is a three - dimensional network of corner - sharing tetrahedra , which is known to possess strong geometrical frustration .",
    "mo cation is nominally tetravalent and has two electrons on average .",
    "the crystal field from trigonal distortion of moo@xmath7 octahedra splits three - fold @xmath8 levels of mo @xmath9 electrons into @xmath1 singlet and @xmath0 doublet .",
    "the trigonal axis is along the direction toward the center of each mo tetrahedron , which is called the local @xmath2 axis . with aligning their spins",
    "parallel according to the hund s rule , one of two electrons occupies the lower @xmath1 level , and the other comes in the doubly - degenerate @xmath0 levels .",
    "( see , for example , fig .  1 in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) hence spin , charge , and orbital degrees of freedom are all active in these compounds , and the frustration of the lattice structure promotes the competition among them by preventing a simple ordering .",
    "in addition , the coupling between mo @xmath9 electrons and @xmath6-site rare - earth moments brings about further complications . in the following ,",
    "however , we will focus on the phenomena commonly observed regardless of magnetic or nonmagnetic @xmath6 cations , such as the phase competition mentioned above , and neglect the @xmath6 sites : we will concentrate on the mo pyrochlore network alone and the intrinsic physics from mo @xmath9 electrons in this paper .",
    "several theoretical studies have been done for understanding the phase competition in the mo pyrochlore oxides .",
    "a pioneering work was done for the chemical substitution at ambient pressure by solovyev by using the lda+@xmath10 calculation  @xcite .",
    "the calculated electronic structure indicates that the lower @xmath1 level has rather localized nature with a narrow band , while the @xmath0 levels form a relatively wide band and bears itinerant nature .",
    "the observation suggests that the system can be viewed as a double - exchange ( de ) system , in which localized @xmath1 spins are coupled with itinerant @xmath0 electrons via the ferromagnetic hunds - rule coupling .",
    "this explains well the emergence of fm in the compounds with large ionic radius of @xmath6 , such as @xmath6=nd and sm .",
    "the calculation while changing the value of @xmath10 shows that the localization from fm to sg insulator by the substitution is basically understood by the correlation effect ( or the bandwidth control ) .",
    "these calculations , however , were performed with assuming a simple collinear ferro or antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering ; hence , the detailed nature of the frustrated insulating phase , such as the sg behavior and the orbital state , was not clarified .",
    "recently , the authors have studied the phase competition under applied pressure  @xcite .",
    "the results show that the change from fm , sg metal , to pm is well reproduced by monte carlo ( mc ) calculations for an extended de model including the superexchange ( se ) af coupling between localized spins .",
    "in particular , the peculiar diffusive nature of pm is explained by the strongly incoherent state originating from competition between the de ferromagnetic interaction and the se af interaction  @xcite .",
    "the sg metallic state is also accounted by an instability toward phase separation related to the competition  @xcite .",
    "the agreement implies that the physical pressure causes a different effect from the chemical pressure ( chemical substitution ) , as implied in the experimental report  @xcite : the former tends to increase the se af coupling between the @xmath1 spins dominantly , while the latter mainly modifies the bandwidth of itinerant @xmath0 electrons .",
    "mc calculations so far were performed for a single - band model with neglecting the coulomb repulsion between itinerant electrons ; for comprehensive understanding of the phase competition in the mo pyrochlore oxides , it is necessary to extend the analysis to incorporate the electron correlation as well as the @xmath0 orbital degree of freedom .    in this contribution , we investigate the effect of electron correlation and orbital degeneracy on the phase competition in the extended de model .",
    "the model explicitly includes the twofold orbital degeneracy and the coulomb repulsion between itinerant electrons .",
    "thermodynamic properties of the model are studied by mc calculations , in which the electron correlation is handled by an unrestricted - type hartree approximation .",
    "the results indicate that , in addition to the phase transition from fm to pm previously obtained in the single - band model , a metal - insulator transition is caused by the electronic correlation accompanied by a ` ferro'-type orbital ordering .",
    "we discuss the phase diagram in relation to the distinct behaviors in experiments for the chemical substitution and the applied pressure in the mo pyrochlore oxides .    0",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we introduce our model and numerical method .",
    "mc results are shown in sec .  3 .",
    "schematic phase diagram at low temperatures is deduced . in sec .  4",
    ", we discuss the results in comparison with experiments with some concluding remarks .",
    "as an extension of the previous studies  @xcite , we here consider the de model with twofold orbital degeneracy .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with orbital @xmath14 and spin @xmath15 at site @xmath16 , @xmath17 denotes the pauli matrix , and @xmath18 represents the localized spin at site @xmath16 .",
    "the first term describes the electron hopping between nearest - neighbor sites @xmath19 on the pyrochlore lattice ; the transfer integrals depend on the orbital indices @xmath14 and @xmath20 which represent two @xmath0 orbitals .",
    "the second term denotes the onsite coulomb interactions between the @xmath0 electrons , including the intra and interorbital repulsions , the hunds - rule coupling , and the pair hopping .",
    "the third term denotes the hunds - rule coupling between itinerant electrons and localized spins @xmath18 .",
    "the last term is the se af coupling between the neighboring localized spins .",
    "a similar model has been studied on the square or cubic lattices in the context of colossal magnetiresistive ( cmr ) manganites  @xcite .",
    "our purpose is to clarify thermodynamics of the model given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_full ] ) and to elucidate the competing phases including correlated disordered states , such as the diffusive pm or the mott insulating state . for this purpose ,",
    "some sophisticated method beyond a simple mean - field approximation is necessary .",
    "the model ( [ eq : h_full ] ) , however , is very complicated and difficult to handle beyond a simple mean - field approximation .",
    "hence , we introduce several simplifications as follows .",
    "first we take the limit of large @xmath21 . in this limit , as often considered in the study of cmr , spins of itinerant electrons are aligned parallel to the localized spin at each site , and the transfer integrals are modulated by the relative angle between the neighboring localized spins . at the same time , among may contributions in the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_full ] ) , only the interorbital interaction between the same spin electrons remains relevant .",
    "furthermore , we consider the localized spins @xmath18 as classical vectors with the renormalized length @xmath22 .",
    "the simplifications were shown to give reasonable results in the study of a single - band model for the phase competition under pressure in the wide - bandwidth compounds  @xcite .",
    "consequently , by taking the local spin axis along the direction of localized spin at each site , the model can be described by spinless fermions in the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the spinless fermion operator and @xmath25 . here ,",
    "@xmath26 is considered as an effective interorbital interaction , which controls the double occupancy in the @xmath0 orbital with the same spin electrons under the strong hunds - rule coupling ; its origin is traced back to the @xmath0 interorbital coulomb repulsion and the hunds - rule couplings between @xmath0-@xmath0 and @xmath0-@xmath1 orbitals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_full ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we consider the filling with one electron per site on average .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , the effective transfer integral is given by @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 denotes the angle of @xmath18 . to estimate the value of @xmath29 , it is necessary to take account of the anisotropy of the @xmath0 orbitals and the relative angle of mo - o - mo bond .",
    "following the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate the orbital diagonal and off - diagonal elements : it turns out that the ratio between them depends solely on the mo - o - mo bond angle @xmath30 as @xmath31 thus , the orbital off - diagonal element is larger than the diagonal one for @xmath32 . in mo pyrochlore oxides ,",
    "@xmath30 is estimated around @xmath33 at ambient pressure  @xcite . in the following calculations , for simplicity ,",
    "we consider only the dominant off - diagonal element and fix @xmath34 and @xmath35 , although the transfer integrals might change depending on both chemical and physical pressure .",
    "we study the model ( [ eq : h ] ) by mc simulation in a similar way as in the previous studies for the single - band model  @xcite . to facilitate the mc calculations without negative sign problem",
    ", we introduce an unresticted - type mean - field decoupling to the coulomb interaction in the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) . here , as the simplest approximation",
    ", we employ the hartree approximation ; @xmath36 .",
    "the mc sampling is performed to update the configurations of localized spins @xmath37 . in each mc step , the mean fields @xmath38 are recalculated by using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained from the exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "we confirmed the convergence of the mean fields within the statistical errorbars after thermalization .",
    "we also employ the averaging over the twisted boundary conditions to suppress the finite size effect  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we show the result for 16 site system with averaging over @xmath39 different twisted boundary conditions .",
    "typically , we perform 2000 mc steps for measurement after 1000 mc steps for thermalization .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the mc results for the model ( [ eq : h ] ) at a low temperature @xmath40 while changing the coulomb repulsion @xmath26 and the se af coupling @xmath41 .",
    "we compute the square of magnetization @xmath42 , the charge compressibility @xmath43 , and the @xmath44 component of orbital polarization @xmath45 , by @xmath46 respectively . here",
    "the bracket @xmath47 denotes the thermal average , @xmath48 is the number of sites , @xmath49 is the chemical potential , and @xmath50 is the electron density .",
    "mc results for the model given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) at @xmath51 and @xmath40 : ( a ) square of the magnetization @xmath42 [ eq .  ( [ eq : m^2 ] ) ] , ( b ) charge compressibility @xmath43 [ eq .  ( [ eq : chi_c ] ) ] , and ( c ) @xmath44 component of orbital polarization @xmath45 [ eq .  ( [ eq : tau^z ] ) ] . the results are obtained for 16 site cluster by taking average over twisted boundary conditions with @xmath39 different fluxes . ]    as shown in fig .  [ fig1](a ) , in the small @xmath41 region , the magnetization is large , indicating that the system is ferromagnetic . the ferromagnetism collapses as @xmath41 increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetism is relatively insensitive to @xmath26 . for small @xmath26 ,",
    "the charge compressibility @xmath43 is finite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , indicating that the system is metallic .",
    "hence , the system is fm for small @xmath41 , while it turns into pm as @xmath41 increases in the small @xmath26 region .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively the same as observed in the single - band model  @xcite . in the single - band case",
    ", phase separation appears between the two phases  @xcite ; we expect a similar behavior in the present two - band case , but it is not clearly seen in the present calculation presumably because of the small size cluster .    as @xmath26 increases",
    ", @xmath43 decreases rapidly to zero , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "this signals the metal - to - insulator transition .",
    "the insulating state is characterized by an orbital ordering .",
    "figure  [ fig1](c ) shows that the orbital polarization becomes nonzero almost simultaneously with the disappearance of the charge compressibility .",
    "this means that the insulating state shows a ` ferro'-type orbital order by choosing one of two @xmath0 orbitals .",
    "the reason for the ` ferro'-type orbital order is understood from the strong coupling picture as follows . in the large @xmath26 limit",
    ", the second order perturbation in the transfer integrals leads to the so - called kugel - khomskii - type spin - orbital exchange couplings  @xcite . in the present model , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the spin configuration is governed by the competition between de and se interactions , not by @xmath26 . then , the ` ferro'-type orbital configuration is favored via the spin - orbital exchange couplings , irrespective of spin configurations , because the dominant hopping processes in the perturbation are the orbital off - diagonal ones by @xmath52 in the present model .",
    "the situation is contrastive to the ` myth ' for the kugel - khomskii - type interactions , in which the system usually favors complementary spin - orbital configurations , such as spin - af orbital - ferro or spin - ferro orbital - af .",
    "it is worthy to note that the ` ferro'-type orbital order is not a uniform orbital order .",
    "the trigonal distortion is along the local @xmath2 axis at each site , and hence , the @xmath0 orbital polarization takes place along the site - dependent local axis . in other words ,",
    "the ` ferro'-type orbital order is a @xmath53 four - sublattice order .",
    "thus it does not break the cubic symmetry of the pyrochlore lattice structure .    summarizing the results ,",
    "we obtain four dominant phases at low temperatures in the plane of @xmath26 and @xmath41 , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the spin - ferro orbital - para metal in the small @xmath26 and small @xmath41 region",
    "is stabilized by the de mechanism .",
    "the spin - para orbital - para metal in the small @xmath26 and large @xmath41 region is induced by the competition between the de ferromagnetic interaction and the se af coupling under the geometrical frustration . in these two phases ,",
    "the orbital degree of freedom is less important , and hence , the physics is common to the single - band case  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin - ferro and orbital-`ferro ' insulator in the large @xmath26 and small @xmath41 region is a correlation - driven insulator with development of the orbital ordering .",
    "the spin - para orbital-`ferro ' insulator is driven by the increase of @xmath41 and the spin frustration .",
    "schematic phase diagram at low temperatures suggested from the results in fig .",
    "the dotted ( dot - dashed ) arrow in the figure indicates a possible parameter change while changing the physical ( chemical ) pressure in the mo pyrochlore oxides .",
    "see the text for details . ]",
    "in mo pyrochlore oxides , as mentioned in sec .  1 , the chemical substitution leads to the transition from fm to sg insulator , while the pressure induces the transition from fm to pm .",
    "the latter is qualitatively explained by the change of @xmath41 in the single - band model  @xcite , and the present calculation for the extended two - band model also gives similar results in the small @xmath26 regime ; the parameter change is , e.g. , schematically shown by the dotted arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the metal - insulator transition by the chemical substitution can not be understood by the single - band physics . from our results",
    ", we deduce that the transition from fm to sg insulator is described by the transition from the spin - ferro orbital - para metal to the spin - para orbital-`ferro ' insulator , as indicated by the dot - dashed arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the",
    "spin - para orbital-`ferro ' insulating state , the spin degree of freedom remains paramagnetic because of the strong frustration , but short - range af correlations are expected by the dominant @xmath41 .",
    "the remaining frustration might be released by remnant perturbations neglected in the present model .",
    "in fact , one of the author and his collaborators recently demonstrated that the frustrated spins have instability toward a sg state through the coupling to local lattice distortions in the presence of bond disorder , reasonably in accord with the experiments in mo pyrochlore oxides  @xcite .",
    "thus , our results provide a hint for understanding the nature of the frustrated mott insulating state in the mo pyrochlore oxides . from these observations , we consider that , despite several simplifications introduced , our effective two - band model given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) can offer a simple starting point for comprehensively understanding the intricate physics @xmath3mo@xmath4o@xmath5 .",
    "further analysis in larger system sizes is desired to elucidate the thermodynamics as well as transport properties .    why and how the two effects , the chemical substitution and the pressure , lead to such different behaviors remain unclear . in the present scenario ,",
    "these effects are attributed to the different control of the coulomb repulsion ( or the bandwidth ) and the se af coupling between @xmath1 spins .",
    "the bandwidth is basically determined by the transfer integrals between the itinerant @xmath0 orbitals , i.e. , @xmath29 in our model , on the other hand , the se af coupling @xmath41 is approximately set by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the transfer integral between the @xmath1 orbitals and the intraorbital coulomb repulsion in the @xmath1 orbital , respectively . both @xmath29 and @xmath55",
    "are modified by the chemical or physical pressure via the change of the angle and/or bond length of mo - o - mo bonds . in order to clarify how they are modified and to distinguish the two effects ,",
    "it is highly desired to study the microscopic change of the lattice parameters by , e.g. , the detailed x - ray scattering experiment or the first - principles calculations with structural optimization .",
