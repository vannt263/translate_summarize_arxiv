    "structured light waves have become particularly interesting in recent years due to their remarkable properties and extended range of applications.@xcite a big part of the effort in the field has been targeted at the so - called _ non - diffracting waves _ , namely waves that resist diffraction ( in their realistic finite - energy versions ) and thus maintain their transverse intensity profile over large distances.@xcite bessel beams @xcite are perhaps the most familiar example with diverse applications in optical manipulation , atom and nonlinear optics .",
    "@xcite other examples are mathieu @xcite and parabolic beams @xcite which follow as separable solutions of the wave equation in elliptic or parabolic coordinates , respectively .",
    "self - imaging beams that reproduce their profile periodically with distance and beams that rotate their profile around the axis of propagation also qualify as non - diffracting or , more generally , as propagation - invariant waves.@xcite more recently , the family of non - diffracting beams expanded with the introduction of accelerating airy beams @xcite and , subsequently , with the complete set of paraxial accelerating beams.@xcite these waves have a non - diffracting profile that shifts laterally according to a quadratic law with the propagation distance , thus writing a parabola in free space .",
    "the demonstrated and envisaged applications of accelereting beams have also been numerous.@xcite hybrids between the accelerating and non - accelerating families are also possible , as for example the accelerating bessel - like beams in the paraxial @xcite or nonparaxial @xcite regime .",
    "non - diffracting waves owe their properties to their special structure of rays which is such that the resulting transverse interference pattern does not change with the propagated distance . a bessel beam , for example ,",
    "is produced by ray cones with a fixed opening angle and expanding circular bases on the input aperture.@xcite with appropriate deformation of the cones , their apexes can be made to trace a curved path which results in an accelerating bessel - like beam.@xcite airy beams , on the other hand , have a very different structure since their rays create parabolic optical caustics .",
    "what is however common among non - diffracting waves is that their profile at increasing propagation distances is produced by rays emitted from points on the input aperture that are increasingly far from their `` center of mass '' ( the center of mass of a beam with amplitude @xmath0 propagating along the @xmath1 axis lies at the transverse position @xmath2 ) .",
    "the on - axis far field of a bessel beam , for example , is produced by rays emitted from the expanding circles on the input plane mentioned before .",
    "this property of non - diffracting beams ensures that , if some of the inner rays are scattered or blocked , the outer rays will still produce the beam s profile at longer distances , which is a remarkable property of non - diffracting beams called _ self - healing_.@xcite a wave - optics description of this property is also possible .",
    "@xcite this should be contrasted with gaussian beams where the on - axis field is produced by the single on - axis ray ( except on the focal point ) . if this ray is blocked then the field along the entire @xmath1 axis is distorted .",
    "along the same lines , certain advantages have been highlighted in the propagation of non - diffracting beams in turbulent media .",
    "@xcite    perusing the literature one sees that non - diffracting waves have been so far a concept limited in free space or homogeneous media , with medium inhomogeneities introduced only locally or randomly when self - healing after scattering or robustness in turbulence are to be studied , respectively .",
    "going beyond these ideas , one may wish to explore the possibility of waves that propagate in a non - diffracting fashion in non - scattering inhomogeneous media that are inherently more diffractive than free space .",
    "that would be for example the case of _ optical antiguides _",
    "( also called unstable optical ducts @xcite ) , namely cylindrically symmetric inhomogeneous media whose index of refraction increases with the distance from the axis thus making rays bend outwards and waves diffract quickly .    that non - diffracting waves of this kind should exist",
    "is already suggested by the airy wavepacket paradigm .",
    "the airy wavefunction is the unique non - spreading solution ( excluding the unbounded function bi ) of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) schrdinger equation in a field of constant force.@xcite by the analogy between schrdinger equation and helmholtz equation for paraxial optical waves , it is deduced that a 1d optical airy beam propagates without diffracting ( and without accelerating ! ) in a medium whose index of refraction varies linearly in the transverse direction , e.g. @xmath3 .",
    "this is obvious from the fact that the airy function solves the differential equation @xmath4 .",
    "again , the non - spreading nature ( or stability ) of this wave can be explained by its structure of parabolic rays enveloping a straight caustic.@xcite now imagine a cylindrical antiguide whose index increases linearly with the distance @xmath5 from the axis .",
    "if we consider circularly symmetric waves , their corresponding rays are meridional and the underlying ray equation is identical to the 1d case with the cartesian coordinate @xmath6 replaced by the radial coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "hence , a circularly symmetric beam must exist ( a 2d wave ) that propagates without diffracting along the unstable linear duct and has in the @xmath7 plane the same ray structure with the 1d airy wavepacket in a linear potential .    beyond these simple arguments , in this paper",
    "we report a family of waves that propagate without diffracting in optical antiguides with a power - law variation of their refractive index .",
    "these waves can have zero or nonzero angular momentum while their radial amplitude satisfies a bcher - type differential equation . at sufficiently large radial positions the solution behaves asymptotically like a bessel function with an argument of the order @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the power with which the refractive index varies .",
    "for a certain value of the propagation constant that is equal to the wave number on the antiguide s axis ( core wave number ) , the wave amplitude is exactly proportional to a bessel function with an argument that is proportional to @xmath10 . in any case",
    ", this nonlinear dependence of the argument on the radius causes the wave amplitude to oscillate with an increasing spatial frequency similar to a chirped pulse in time .",
    "these properties prompt us to name the new waves _ chirped bessel _ waves .",
    "similar to standard bessel beams in homogeneous space , chirped bessel waves in antiguides carry ideally infinite power which means that their realistic versions have to be subject to some kind of apodization of aperturing .",
    "closing this introduction , we would like to mention that the question of trapping vortex waves in an optical antiguide was addressed recently .",
    "@xcite in this work simple vortex modes of the laguerre - gauss type were launched in curved antiguides with a gaussian index profile hoping to observe some trapping effect and guidance of the vortex along the antiguide . the conclusion was negative as the test waves had no special structure ( for example chirp ) in the radial direction .",
    "the chirped bessel waves introduced here can indeed propagate in a stable ( diffraction - resisting ) fashion along a straight optical antiguide .",
    "moreover , our simulations show that these waves remain robust when launched in a curved antiguide being however attracted along a curved trajectory toward the direction of increasing index .",
    "to keep things simple , we consider paraxial propagation of waves in an optical antiguide with a refractive index that increases radially as @xmath11 ^{1/2 } \\label{refractive_index}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a characteristic radius and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are real parameters .",
    "notice that in eq .",
    "we have used a notation that is familiar within the field of graded - index optical fibers.@xcite to stay in the paraxial regime and ignore polarization effects , the increase in the refractive index must act as a perturbation to the core index @xmath15 .",
    "in analogy to the terminology of weakly guiding waveguides and fibers , an antiguide of this form can be thought to be _",
    "weakly antiguiding_. with @xmath16 , this will be true within distances of few @xmath12 from the axis .",
    "we will return to this point later in this section .    in the paraxial regime",
    ", any component of the electromagnetic field can be expressed as @xmath17 , where @xmath0 is an envelope function that varies slowly along @xmath1 and @xmath18 is the core wave number at a vacuum wavelength @xmath19 .",
    "the evolution equation for the envelope is the paraxial wave ( or paraxial helmholtz ) equation which reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the above equation is often viewed from a quantum - mechanical perspective namely as schrdinger equation for wave function @xmath22 with @xmath1 playing the role of time . in this context",
    "an antiguide is equivalent to an unstable potential @xmath23 which justifies the minus sign that we used in its definition .",
    "we now assume a non - diffracting solution of eq . of the form @xmath24 where integer @xmath25 is the order of vorticity ( or topological charge ) and",
    "@xmath26 is a dimensionless real number with @xmath27 so that the assumption of a slowly varying along @xmath1 envelope stays true . substituting into eq .",
    "we get @xmath28 with the primes indicating ordinary differentiation with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "the above falls under the general family of bcher s equations @xcite and has no tabulated solution for a general value of @xmath9 .",
    "the solution has to be obtained numerically or in the form of a series , a method that is frequently applied to graded - index optical fibers.@xcite in the particular case @xmath29 and @xmath30 , eq . is called the _ bessel wave _ equation and has been studied to some extent in the literature . in analogy to the terminology of bessel functions ,",
    "its non - singular solution is termed bessel wave function of the first kind @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite    let us first note two cases where eq",
    ". admits a solution in terms of standard bessel functions .",
    "the first is the limit @xmath32 whereby the medium is homogeneous with an index @xmath33 .",
    ". reduces to bessel equation with the nonsingular solution being the bessel function of the first kind @xcite @xmath34 we thus obtain a standard bessel beam of order @xmath25 .",
    "obviously we must have @xmath30 , which means that the propagation constant @xmath35 is lower than the medium wave number @xmath36 ( recall the @xmath37 factor muliplying the envelope function @xmath0 of eq . ) .",
    "the second case is that of a wave with @xmath38 namely with a propagation constant @xmath39 equal to the core wave number . we then obtain a transformed version of bessel equation with nonsingular solution @xcite @xmath40 this is a chirped bessel beam with vorticity @xmath25 that propagates without spreading ( or diffracting ) along the antiguide . note",
    "that , for real @xmath9 and integer @xmath25 , the order of the bessel function @xmath41 is generally a real number which reduces to @xmath25 only when @xmath42 namely in a homogenous medium .",
    "why such a solution is chirped we can easily understand from the large - argument asymptotics of bessel functions @xmath43 which holds generally for real order @xmath44 ( and complex argument with @xmath45 ) .",
    "having a closed - form solution like at hand , few interesting remarks are in order .",
    "first , note that the argument of the bessel function in eq .",
    "can be intuitively explained by the concept of the local radial wave number @xmath46 .",
    "this is a measure of the spatial frequency of the radial oscillations and , due to the asymptotic form , it is defined as the derivative of the argument in eq . with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "the result is @xmath47 where we have also used eq . .",
    "thus @xmath46 and @xmath48 are connected through the dispersion relationship of a plane wave in a homogeneous medium with index equal to the local value @xmath49 .",
    "second , note that in a homogeneous medium with index @xmath33 , @xmath36 is a cut - off propagation constant for propagating waves in the sense that @xmath50 . as @xmath51",
    ", the transverse wave number tends to zero and the corresponding bessel beam oscillates so slowly that it effectively assumes a constant amplitude which is nonzero only for the @xmath52 case .",
    "however , when the index is perturbed as in eq . , waves with @xmath53 are enabled and , no matter how small @xmath54 is , chirped bessel waves can oscillate many times as long as the characteristic radius is large enough compared to the wavelength in the medium @xmath55 this is easily deduced from eq . by setting @xmath56 .",
    "the argument becomes proportional to @xmath57 thus allowing a large ratio @xmath58 to compensate for a small @xmath54 .",
    "it is also interesting to see how the solution of eq .",
    "behaves near the axis of the antiguide . in the limit @xmath59 ,",
    "the power term @xmath60 becomes negligibly small compared to the quadratic term and eq .",
    "reduces to the bessel or modified bessel equation depening on whether @xmath30 or @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "thus in this limit the solution behaves either like a bessel or modified bessel function of the first kind with the same argument with eq . .",
    "this could also be expected intuitively since , near the axis , the medium has a flat index profile @xmath62 hence the wave should behave as a standard bessel beam in a homogeneous medium . in any case",
    "the small argument asymptotic of bessel functions reads @xcite @xmath63 hence the envelope of the wave behaves near the axis as @xmath64 . in the other extreme , namely as @xmath65 , the power term @xmath60 dominates the quadratic term which can be neglected .",
    "we thus obtain the modified bessel equation of the @xmath66 case and , since we are far from @xmath67 , the solution behaves asymptotically as a linear superposition of a bessel and a neumann function ( or bessel function of the second kind ) with the argument of eq . .",
    "figure [ figure_1 ] shows examples of chirped bessel waves with @xmath66 and various orders of vorticity . for the antiguide",
    "we have used parameters that are common to graded - index optical fibers .",
    "one can observe the chirped oscillations of the solution as well as the discussed behaviour near the axis .",
    "in the @xmath68 case notice the flattening of the amplitude near the axis which is due to the @xmath69 dependence .     of the chirped bessel waves of eq . for different orders of vorticity @xmath70",
    "the insets show the corresponding transverse intensity profiles @xmath71 . for the antiguide we have chosen the parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath29 , @xmath74 at a vacuum wavelength @xmath75.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      before proceeding to numerical simulations",
    ", it is instructive to obtain a better physical intuition of the waves under consideration using ray optics .",
    "we have already mentioned that the non - diffracting nature of the 1d airy wavepacket in a linear potential ( constant force field ) can be explained through its structure of parabolic rays enveloping a straight caustic .",
    "a generalization of this picture to a nonlinear power - law potential provides the ray structure of our chirped bessel waves . for simplicity",
    "we limit ourselves to waves with zero angular momentum @xmath76 .",
    "then the rays are meridional and the paraxial ray equation is written in the @xmath7 plane as @xcite @xmath77 where we have used the fact that the index of refraction does not dependent on @xmath1 . as a result , the ray equation is invariant along the @xmath1 axis or , using the strict mathematical term , autonomous .",
    "this implies that , if @xmath78 is a solution to eq .",
    ", the shifted along the @xmath1 axis ray @xmath79 is also a solution for any @xmath80 . based on this property ,",
    "the ray pattern of a non - diffracting wave is obtained as a continuum of shifted copies of a particular solution of the ray equation for @xmath80 running ideally from @xmath81 to @xmath82 . by revolving this @xmath7 pattern around the @xmath1 axis ,",
    "the total 3d ray structure is obtained .",
    "a transverse cut of this ray structure at any level @xmath1 yields the same interference pattern which is what one physically observes as a non - diffracting wave .    by substituting eq . into the ray equation and rearranging we get @xmath83 where in the right - hand side we have approximated a factor @xmath84^ { - 1}$ ] by unity . for @xmath85 ( a linear potential ) , the right - hand side is a constant and we obtain parabolic rays of the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 are integration constants while the subscript _",
    "l _ is a reminder of the linear variation of the refractive index . for @xmath29 ( inverse harmonic oscillator potential ) ,",
    "the ray equation is solved by exponential rays of the general form @xmath88 where the subscript _ q _ indicates the quadratic variation of the refractive index . for @xmath89 ,",
    "is a second - order nonlinear differential equation of the emden - fowler type @xcite and has a known implicit solution .",
    "@xcite instead of directly applying the relevant formula , we here find it more useful to reduce eq . to an equivalent first - order differential equation .",
    "this is done by multiplying both sides with @xmath90 and integrating with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "the result is @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a dimensionless constant of integration .",
    "this constant is connected with the propagation constant of our non - diffracting waves .",
    "this is better understood if one views eq . as the conservation law of the longitudinal momentum in our system .",
    "indeed , in a medium that is invariant along @xmath1 , the @xmath48 component of the wavevector of a ray is conserved exactly as the tangential wave vector after refraction through a planar interface ( snell s law ) .",
    "it follows that each ray is characterized by a @xmath48 that stays invariant along its trajectory and is given by the projection of the local wave vector along the @xmath1 axis , namely @xmath93^ { - 1/2 }   \\label{ray_kz}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the angle between the ray and the @xmath1 axis .",
    "according to our definition and the previous discussion , the rays that compose our non - diffracting waves have the invariant @xmath35 . substituting into eq . and making a paraxial approximation @xmath95 , we get @xmath96 which is identical with eq . if @xmath97 .    the particular form of the ray equation or allows to distinguish two different regimes or patterns of ray structure . for @xmath61 ,",
    "the slope of a ray with respect to the axis @xmath90 vanishes at the radius @xmath98 .",
    "this radius is a turning point of the rays and is identified with a caustic radius of the corresponding non - diffracting wave . since the rays can not reach this region , the intensity of the wave is low in @xmath99 . for waves with @xmath30 , on the other hand , @xmath90 never vanishes and the rays cross the axis of the antiguide with a slope @xmath100 . after the crossing their convexity changes sign and",
    "the total trajectory is symmetric with respect to the crossing point . in the boundary between the two regimes ,",

    "the rays are also asymptotic to transverse planes @xmath104 .",
    "finally , for @xmath66 and @xmath29 , eq . yields exponential rays which are also asymptotic to the @xmath1 axis .",

    "( d ) two different ray colors are used for visualization purposes.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    figure [ figure_2 ] illustrates the different cases of rays discussed above .",
    "the rays are repeated along the @xmath1 axis to show the ray structure of our chirped bessel waves in a meridional plane .",
    "the slope of the rays has been exagerrated for visualization purposes .",
    "figure [ figure_2](a ) shows the case @xmath61 where the rays are reflected at the caustic radius @xmath109 which is the point at which @xmath26 equals the relative index difference @xmath110 . in ( b ) we have the case @xmath30 where the rays cross the axis and continue with the opposite convexity . in ( c )",
    "we have the case @xmath66 and @xmath102 in which the rays are reflected at the axis , while ( d ) shows the case @xmath66 and @xmath107 where the rays are asymptotic to the axis .",
    "finally note that these ray patterns suggest that the chirped bessel waves are also able to self - heal like their standard bessel counterparts , since the rays contributing to the field near the axis at a large distance @xmath1 are emitted from far off - axis points on the input plane @xmath111 .",
    "the above concern waves without angular momentum . by introducing the azimuthal",
    "coordinate in the ray equation , ray patterns of vortex waves can also be derived .",
    "these involve skew rather than meridional rays .",
    "the vorticity introduces an additional unstable potential with a dependence @xmath112 which acts as a centrifugal force pushing the intensity distribution of the waves away from the axis which becomes a field node .",
    "finally note that , in using paraxial ray optics results , one should be aware of their limitations .",
    "a rule of thumb is that the paraxial approximation is satisfactory for ray angles smaller than @xmath113 or roughly slopes @xmath114 . for larger angles",
    ", the complete nonparaxial ray equation is required to determine the accurate shapes of the rays .",
    "@xcite for example , rays in a medium with a linear index profile are actually parabolic only within a finite propagation length around their turning point , where the paraxial approximation holds , while they diverge with an exponential law at larger slopes .",
    "however , we will not pursue ray optics any further here .",
    "we now proceed to investigate numerically the propagation of chirped bessel waves in antiguides .",
    "as mentioned , their radial profile is obtained by solving eq . .",
    "to this end , we transform this second - order differential equation to a system of two first - order differential equations for functions @xmath115 and @xmath116 and then we solve this system using a high - order runge - kutta scheme.@xcite to avoid the singularity of this system at @xmath67 , the initial conditions are imposed at @xmath117 and their values are obtained from the limiting behaviour of the solution that we determined in section [ wave analysis ] . for a wave with @xmath68 for example , we may start with @xmath118 , @xmath119 .",

    "the complete evolution of the solution with @xmath26 is tracked in the map of fig .",
    "[ figure_3](c ) .",
    "as @xmath26 assumes lower negative values , the oscillations get compressed because the local transverse wave number increases ( recall the discussion following eq . ) . as @xmath26 assumes larger positive values , the maximum shifts further away from the axis because the caustic radius increases .",
    "exactly as happens with the airy wave packet , the wave amplitude decays super - exponentially toward the dark side of the caustic and thus the interior of the caustic cylinder contains low optical intentisy .",
    "we can now use the chirped bessel waves that we have determined numerically as an input to an optical antiguide and investigate their propagation dynamics . at this point",

    "the wave starts propagating along a straight trajectory demonstrating its non - diffracting property .",
