    "the origin of mass is a fundamental and fascinating subject in physics for a long time .",
    "a standard interpretation of mass origin is the interaction with the higgs field .",
    "however , the mass of higgs origin is only about 1% of total mass in the world , because the higgs interaction only provides the current quark mass ( less than 10mev for light quarks ) and the lepton mass ( 0.51mev for electrons ) . on the other hand ,",
    "apart from unknown dark matter , about 99% of mass of matter in the world originates from the strong interaction , which actually provides the large constituent quark mass @xmath10 .",
    "dynamical fermion - mass generation in the strong interaction can be interpreted as spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , which was first pointed out by y.  nambu  et  al .",
    "@xcite . according to the chiral symmetry breaking , light quarks are considered to have a large constituent quark mass of about @xmath11 .    then , a question arises .",
    "is there any mechanism of dynamical mass generation without chiral symmetry breaking ? to answer this question , we note the following examples .",
    "one example is gluons , colored vector particles in qcd . while the gluon is massless in perturbation qcd , non - perturbative effects due to the self - interaction of gluons seem to generate a large effective gluon mass as @xmath12 , which is measured in lattice qcd @xcite",
    "actually , glueballs , which are composed by gluons , have a large mass , e.g. , about @xmath13 @xcite even for the lightest glueball ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "another example is charm quarks .",
    "the current mass of charm quarks is about @xmath15 at the renormalization point @xmath16 @xcite . in the quark model",
    ", however , the constituent charm - quark mass is about @xmath17 , which reproduces masses of charmonia @xcite .",
    "the about 400mev difference between the current and the constituent charm - quark masses can be explained as dynamical mass generation without chiral symmetry breaking , since there is no chiral symmetry for such a heavy - quark system .",
    "these examples suggest that there is other type of mass generation without chiral symmetry breaking and the higgs mechanism .",
    "then , we conjecture that , even without chiral symmetry breaking , large dynamical mass generation generally occurs in the strong - interaction world , i.e. , _ all colored particles have a large effective mass generated by dressed gluon effects . _",
    "in this paper , we study light ( @xmath18-colored ) `` scalar - quarks '' @xmath0 and their color - singlet hadronic states using quenched su(3)@xmath1 lattice qcd .",
    "this is a test - place for dynamical mass generation without chiral symmetry breaking . also , this light scalar - quark can be regarded as `` diquark '' idealized to be a local field at the scale of @xmath9 , since the diquark picture is often used as an important degrees of freedom in hadron physics .    here , we investigate `` scalar - quark mesons '' @xmath2 and `` scalar - quark baryons '' @xmath3 as the bound states of scalar quarks @xmath0 .",
    "we also investigate bound states of scalar - quarks @xmath0 and quarks @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which we name `` chimera hadrons '' .    to include scalar - quarks @xmath0 together with quarks @xmath4 and gluons in qcd , we adopt the generalized qcd lagrangian density , @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the quark part and @xmath21 the bare mass of scalar - quarks @xmath0 . in the lattice formalism , we adopt the euclidean lattice action for the scalar - quark sector as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the link - variable . for the gluon sector , we adopt the standard wilson action with @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath25 on the lattice spacing @xcite . for the bare scalar - quark mass , we take @xmath26=0.0 , 0.11 , 0.19 and 0.26gev . for the quark sector , we adopt the wilson quark action with the bare quark mass of @xmath27=0.09 , 0.14 and 0.19gev .",
    "the lattice qcd calculations have been performed on the supercomputer nec - sx5 at osaka university with the setup summarized in table  1 .",
    "the large mass generation of scalar - quarks @xmath0 reflects large quantum corrections for scalar particles , similar to the necessity of fine tuning for higgs scalar fields .",
    "this lattice result also indicates that the simple modeling which treats the diquark as a local scalar field at the scale of @xmath28 in qcd is rather dangerous and needs subtle fine tuning .    to summarize ,",
    "we have studied light scalar - quarks @xmath0 ( colored scalar particles or idealized diquarks ) and their color - singlet hadronic states in quenched su(3)@xmath1 lattice qcd in terms of dynamical mass generation .",
    "we have investigated the mass of `` scalar - quark mesons '' @xmath2 , `` scalar - quark baryons '' @xmath3 and `` chimera hadrons '' @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , which are composed by quarks @xmath4 and scalar - quarks @xmath0 . for these new - type hadrons including @xmath0 ,",
    "we have observed large dynamical mass generation of scalar - quarks as @xmath29 due to large quantum corrections by gluons , even for zero bare scalar - quark mass @xmath8 at @xmath30 .    in this way , even without chiral symmetry breaking , large dynamical mass generation occurs for the scalar - quark systems as scalar - quark / chimera hadrons .",
    "together with the large glueball mass ( @xmath31 1.5gev ) and large difference ( @xmath32 400mev ) between current and constituent charm - quark masses , this type of mass generation would be generally occurred in the strong interaction , and therefore we conjecture that all colored particles generally acquire a large effective mass due to dressed gluon effects as shown in fig.2 ."
