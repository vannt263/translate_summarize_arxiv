    "the idea that the h@xmath0 emission lines of be stars originate from an equatorially flattened circumstellar envelope or disk has now been directly verified by interferometric imaging ( quirrenbach et al .",
    "the related explanation of the linear polarization of be stars as due to scattering of the starlight by free electrons in the disk was also confirmed , because the observed position angle of the polarization was found to be perpendicular to the direction of elongation of the disk as projected onto the plane of the sky .",
    "it is this apparent asymmetry of the scattering region that results in a net polarization , by defeating the cancellation which would take place if there were identical scattering subregions in adjacent quadrants of the projected disk ( see fig .  1 ) .    ,",
    "while in the lower sketch the disk is viewed equator - on , with @xmath1 .",
    "double arrows show the direction of vibration of the electric field of starlight scattered in the disk . for",
    "the pole - on case cancellation occurs between adjacent quadrants of the disk , and the net polarization is zero because the electric fields of the scattered light are perpendicular .",
    "when the disk is viewed equator - on there is no cancellation , so the observed polarization is a maximum.,width=432 ]    a thorough historical review of both observation and theory of polarization in be stars was given by coyne & mclean ( 1982 ) .",
    "since that time the major observational developments in the field have been increased spectral resolution by spectropolarimetry and extension of the wavelength coverage into the ultraviolet by space - based observations ( bjorkman 2000 ) . beginning with the pioneering work of poeckert & marlborough ( 1978a , b ) , who calculated the single scattering polarization in an nlte hydrogen envelope , theoretical analysis and modeling of the continuum polarization of",
    "be star disks has progressed through increasingly complicated treatments .",
    "fox ( 1991 ) developed analytic equations to calculate the single scattering polarization for axisymmetric envelopes .",
    "bjorkman & bjorkman ( 1994 ) extended the single scattering calculations to include attenuation and emission within the envelope .",
    "hillier ( 1994 ) developed polarization source functions using traditional feutrier methods to integrate the transfer equation for optically thick cases , while wood , bjorkman , & bjorkman ( 1997 , hereafter wbb ) developed monte carlo methods .",
    "one may wonder , then , if there is anything new to be learned about be stars from continued broadband polarimetry .",
    "the answer is , of course , that even though we now have firmer knowledge of the disk characteristics , including temperature , density , and geometry , broadband polarization monitoring is still a primary source of information on the variability of these quantities over time scales of years to decades , which are typical of the most fundamental aspect of the be phenomenon : the unpredictable transition from the normal b phase to the be phase and back again , associated with the formation and later dissipation of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "this paper attempts to establish a simple and approximate , but nevertheless serviceable approach to the modeling and analysis of polarimetry data to derive the basic envelope parameters .",
    "tracing the observed variability in terms of these parameters still promises to give valuable hints about the nature of the unknown processes involved in the be phenomenon .",
    "figure  2 shows the geometry of the circumstellar envelope model adopted for this study",
    ". introduced by kruszewski , gehrels , & serkowski ( 1968 ) to investigate the polarization of red variables , it was later used by brown & mclean ( 1977 ) to illustrate their theoretical formulation of the polarization by electron scattering in a be disk .",
    "its shape may be described as an axially symmetrical sector of a sphere , with a wedge - shaped cross section opening outward at half - angle @xmath0 .        for small opening angles",
    "the spherical sector is a good representation of an equatorial disk , with the advantage of being mathematically suited for spherical coordinates .",
    "a basic starting point is to assume the disk is pure hydrogen with uniform electron temperature @xmath2 , extending to infinite distance ( @xmath3 in fig .",
    "2 ) from a central star of radius @xmath4 , with electron number density @xmath5 given by a radial power law with exponent @xmath6 :    @xmath7    waters , cot , & lamers ( 1987 ) derived values of @xmath8 for some of the stars also studied in this paper using the slope of the infrared continuum from @xmath9 observations , but the spherical sector model with @xmath3 has the peculiarity that the disk mass is infinite unless @xmath10 . in what follows ,",
    "the symbol @xmath6 will be retained for generality , but @xmath11 is used as a representative mean value in all the numerical computations .",
    "according to fox ( 1991 ) except for a sign error in the first argument of the beta function @xmath12 , the net polarization of light from a central star due to scattering of photons by free electrons ( thomson scattering ) in a surrounding envelope may be roughly approximated for the specific case of the infinite spherical sector geometry as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the angle of inclination of the rotation axis of the star to the line of sight and    @xmath15    is the total radial optical depth for electron scattering in the equatorial plane of the spherical sector in terms of the thomson scattering cross section    @xmath16    equation ( 2 ) is only a single - scattering approximation , based on the assumption that the disk is optically thin and neglecting multiple scattering .",
    "it includes a correction for the geometrical complication that the star is an extended source of light and can not be treated as a point source ( cassinelli , nordsieck , & murison 1987 , hereafter cnm ) , but it does not take into account the occultation of part of the scattering envelope by the star .",
    "so far the calculated polarization has no dependence on wavelength , since it comes from pure electron scattering . however , neutral hydrogen in the envelope absorbs some light both before and after scattering , and the envelope emission ( which is treated here as unpolarized and is not considered to scatter ) dilutes the polarization .",
    "it is therefore necessary to include these wavelength - dependent effects , since they combine to produce the slope of the continuum polarization and the well - known abrupt changes in the polarization at the ionization series limits , as first demonstrated by capps , coyne , & dyck ( 1973 ) and later refined by mclean ( 1979 ) .",
    "assuming lte ionization fractions and level populations , equation  ( 5 ) gives the total wavelength - dependent opacity @xmath17 per gram of neutral hydrogen in the ground state ( aller 1963 ) .",
    "@xmath18 is a fixed numerical factor , @xmath19 is the ionization energy from level @xmath20 in units of @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the correction factor for stimulated emission .",
    "the three individual terms in the equation are a summation over the ionization edges of the first seven discrete energy levels , an integrated term for the combination of all the remaining levels , and a free - free absorption term ( with gaunt factors taken to be unity ) .",
    "see appendix  a for a discussion of nlte corrections .",
    "@xmath23    where    @xmath24    @xmath25    and    @xmath26    if the free electron number density @xmath27 and the electron temperature @xmath2 are known , then the number density @xmath28 of neutral hydrogen atoms in the ground state can be found from the saha equation :    @xmath29    where    @xmath30    the total radial optical depth for neutral hydrogen absorption in the equatorial plane of the spherical sector is therefore    @xmath31    which acts as a wavelength - dependent attenuation factor to reduce the gray polarization .    the volume emission coefficient of the envelope is    @xmath32    where    @xmath33    is the planck function ( not to be confused with the beta function in  3 ) .",
    "the total luminosity of the envelope is then    @xmath34    which together with the stellar flux @xmath35 produces a further wavelength dependence of the polarization .",
    "theoretical values of the stellar flux @xmath35 are taken from tabulated model atmospheres by kurucz ( 1994 ) .    with the wavelength dependence",
    "included , our polarization estimate may now be written as    @xmath36    it should be emphasized that this equation is only an approximation ( even if the disk is optically thin ) , since it includes neither the contribution of scattering of the disk emission to the polarization nor attenuation of the direct starlight by the disk .",
    "also the neutral hydrogen opacity is treated in a very crude way , using only the maximum radial optical depth in the equatorial plane .",
    "it may be of interest to calculate the total mass of the disk , which can be done approximately by simply counting pairs of electrons and protons under the assumption that it consists purely of fully ionized hydrogen :    @xmath37",
    "adjustment of the envelope parameters in the theoretical model to give results consistent with observations might be expected to yield valuable information about the nature of be disks . to compare with observations on the johnson - cousins system , it is first necessary to convolve the theoretically estimated polarization p(@xmath38 ) from equation  ( 15 ) with the bandpass characteristics of the optical system .    as a first approximation ,",
    "let us assume gaussian filter transmission curves based on the standard wavelengths and @xmath39 ( bessell 1979 ) , which are closely matched by the system actually used for the observations ( see table  1 ) .",

    "with the model in hand , an interactive graphical computer interface was designed to allow adjusting the input parameters by trial and error to fit polarization measurements ( mcdavid 1999 ) of eight be stars .",
    "solutions obtained this way should be viewed with some caution since they may not be unique : different geometrical distributions of scatterers can produce the same net polarization .",
    "moreover , given the gross approximations involved , only order - of - magnitude results should be expected .",
    "the model disk has three adjustable parameters : the maximum electron number density @xmath54 , the angle of inclination @xmath14 of the rotation axis to the line of sight , and the opening half - angle @xmath0 .",
    "additionally required fixed parameters for each individual star are the radius @xmath4 , the effective temperature @xmath55 , and the surface gravity @xmath56 , which were estimated from table  1 of collins , truax , & cranmer ( 1991 ) based on spectral types from slettebak ( 1982 ) .",
    "the electron temperature of the disk was then fixed at @xmath57 and the appropriate kurucz flux table chosen to match @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the fixed disk temperature @xmath2 affects the wavelength dependence of the polarization through its influence on the neutral hydrogen opacity by setting the degree of ionization and the populations of the excited states ( eq .  [ 5 ] ) .",
    "it influences not only the hydrogen absorption optical depth ( eq .  [ 11 ] ) , but also the disk luminosity ( eq .  [ 14 ] ) , which is another contributor to the wavelength dependence of the polarization . as a result , @xmath2 is important in determining the polarization balmer jump and the slope of the polarization over the paschen continuum , both of which generally increase at lower temperatures .",
    "appendix  a explains the nlte corrections to the level populations which are necessary to fit these features for some of the program stars .",
    "it is instructive to summarize individually the effects of the three adjustable parameters on the behavior of @xmath58 according to equation  ( 15 ) .",
    "\\(1 ) the overall degree of gray polarization is directly proportional to @xmath59 through the factor @xmath60 in equation  ( 2 ) .",
    "however , simply increasing @xmath59 does not always result in an overall polarization increase , because it also increases the attenuation and adds to the wavelength dependence of the polarization through @xmath61 ( eq .  [ 11 ] ) and @xmath62 ( eq .  [ 14 ] ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the earliest basic electron scattering models ( e.g.  brown & mclean 1977 ) gave a @xmath63 dependence of the polarization on @xmath14 , and further refinements have not qualitatively changed the simple picture of figure  1 in which a face - on disk shows no net polarization because of symmetrical cancellation , while the maximum asymmetry of an edge - on disk results in the maximum polarization .",
    "it may seem likely that @xmath14 is poorly determined in this model since the same polarization might be obtained , for example , by decreasing @xmath14 while increasing @xmath0 , keeping @xmath59 constant .",
    "experiments do not bear this out , though , because a thicker disk has a higher luminosity , which changes the wavelength dependence of the polarization enough to ruin the fit ( eq .  [ 15 ] ) .",
    "another helpful constraint on @xmath14 is the presence or absence of shell lines , which are thought to be absorption features in the spectral line profiles due to circumstellar material in the line of sight for nearly edge - on equatorial disks . since be stars are generally rapid rotators , spectroscopic measurement of the projected rotational velocity @xmath64",
    "can also suggest roughly the value of  @xmath14 .",
    "\\(3 ) figure  3 shows how the model polarization @xmath65 in the @xmath12 passband varies as @xmath0 increases from @xmath66 to @xmath67 using a typical set of parameters .",
    "the polarization first rises as the widening disk presents an increasing number of scatterers , then begins to decline due to the buildup of enough density at high latitudes to cancel the polarization from the equatorial regions .",
    "the model of waters & marlborough ( 1992 ) also shows this behavior , which becomes of practical concern because the hump - shaped graph allows for both a `` thick disk '' and a `` thin disk '' solution , producing identical polarization at @xmath0 values on opposite sides of the peak . for equal densities , however , the thick disk will have a higher luminosity than the thin disk , giving the polarization a recognizably different wavelength dependence .     on the opening half - angle @xmath0 of the disk using a typical set of parameters.,width=336 ]    figures",

    "since the model presented here is such a crude approximation , it is important to compare its results with those from a more sophisticated model to investigate , at least qualitatively , the accuracy we can expect .",
    "the monte carlo code of wbb is one such standard , and it is based on the same set of input parameters except that the density input is the electron scattering optical depth rather than the electron number density , which requires only a minor conversion .",
    "ideally we would like to determine wbb fits to the program star observations , and then quantitatively evaluate the simplified model by direct comparison of the fit parameters .",
    "unfortunately , because of the slow convergence of the monte carlo method , deriving a wbb fit is a complex process requiring substantial amounts of cpu time even on a fast computer . otherwise there would be no reason for interest in the kind of quick approximation that is the subject of this paper .",
    "for the time being , though , we can at least make use of the existing wbb fit to @xmath79  tau .",

    "it is also encouraging that for @xmath79  tau the best fit of the approximate method as shown in figure  7 and table  2 has @xmath85 , which is well within the range of @xmath86 found by waters , cot , & lamers ( 1987 ) in their infrared study .",
    "however , it must be noted that there is a possibly serious disagreement between the wbb model and the simplified model presented here with regard to the best - fit values of @xmath60 and @xmath0 for @xmath79  tau . while the wbb disk ( @xmath87 and @xmath83 ) is optically thick but geometrically thin ,",
    "the simplified model disk ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) is optically thin and geometrically thicker ( although it still qualifies as `` geometrically thin '' ) .    in figure  12",
    "the approximate model fails to produce a polarization large enough to fit the observations of @xmath79  tau by increasing @xmath60 at constant @xmath0 because it becomes dominated by opacity .",
    "as shown in table  2 , this problem is seemingly avoided by increasing @xmath0 instead of @xmath60 , but the resulting optically thin solution could possibly be ruled out on other grounds , such as the associated infrared emission as discussed by wbb .",
    "this is only one cautionary example emphasizing the importance of independent observational consistency checks in the interpretation of be - star polarimetry data .",
    "in summary , the model presented here appears to give reasonable results for optically thin cases , but we should only trust it for order - of - magnitude accuracy because it is based on so many simplifying assumptions .",
    "even so , it may be useful for estimating trial values of the parameters as starting points for rigorous fitting with more elaborate models .",
    "an interesting result from applying the model to observations of the eight program stars is that all of them may be fit with geometrically thin disks , with opening half - angles of ten degrees or less .",
    "this adds tentative support to the statistics in favor of thin disks as presented by bjorkman & cassinelli ( 1990 ) and later discussed at length by wbb .",
    "if most be disks prove to be similarly flat , it will surely have important implications concerning their formation process .",
    "it may seem discouraging that this model will never find optically thick solutions even if they physically exist . and with three adjustable parameters , there might be any number of apparently valid optically thin fits to a set of data points , rendering the entire exercise inconclusive .",
    "nevertheless , there are good reasons for a more optimistic point of view . due to the efforts of many investigators ,",
    "as documented , for example , in the references in  1 of this paper , the range of physically allowable parameters has been narrowed significantly . and",
    "within even the most liberal of these constraints , experience with a quick , interactive trial - and - error system based on even the elementary physics presented here will show that it is surprisingly difficult to find multiple solutions with qualitatively different sets of parameters .",
    "i will be glad to share my idl modeling program with interested users on request .",
    "thanks to joe cassinelli for critical reading and commentary on early drafts of this paper , and especially for suggesting a method to estimate the nlte departure coefficients for the neutral hydrogen in a be disk .",
    "kenny wood and barbara whitney also provided very helpful discussions , and jon bjorkman kindly gave me a version of the monte carlo polarization code .",
    "i especially thank the anonymous referee for pointing out many serious errors in the original manuscript and for patiently explaining the necessary corrections .",
