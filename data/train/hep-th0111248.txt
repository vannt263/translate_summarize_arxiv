    "in the present note we will report on the evaluation of the correlator of the stress - energy tensor in three - dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( sym(2 + 1 ) ) .",
    "correlation functions play a crucial role in string / field theory correspondences , because they can typically be calculated both on the string and on the field theory side .",
    "the crucial difficulty is that due to the nature of the correspondence , the correlator has to be evaluated in the strong coupling regime on one of the sides . in the past",
    ", we have used the non - perturbative method of supersymmetric discrete light - cone quantization ( sdlcq ) to evaluate correlators at strong couplings , with encouraging results for the validity of the conjectured correspondence @xcite .",
    "while @xmath0 sym(2 + 1 ) is interesting by itself for a number of reasons , it is the version of this theory with extended @xmath4 supersymmetry that corresponds to a string theory of d2 branes @xcite . we have learned from past calculations that the number of supersymmetry operators greatly enhances the size of the numerical calculations . as a first step towards the full @xmath4 calculations we tackle @xmath0 sym(2 + 1 ) here .",
    "contrary to the mass spectrum , correlators use all spectral information , namely energy eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions , and can thus be used to test wavefunctions . in the present case , this is especially useful in order to examine the bps states of the theory .",
    "these states are annihilated by one of the supercharges , and their masses are protected by their symmetry properties , whereas their wavefunctions could change as a function of the coupling .",
    "this is what we seem to find in the present study .    from conformal field theory",
    "it is known that the behavior of the correlator as a function of the distance @xmath3 between the operators should be like @xmath2 for small distances . on the other hand",
    ", the contributions of bound states will have a characteristic length scale associated with their size and one would therefore expect a @xmath5 behavior at small @xmath3 .",
    "the different contributions have thus to work in concert to give the correct @xmath2 behavior .",
    "we will reproduce this behavior both analytically by calculating the free particle correlator and numerically by evaluating the correlator in the interacting theory . at large distances",
    "we find a critical coupling where the correlator goes to zero .",
    "in general we find a good convergence in both the longitudinal and the transverse cutoffs , which is non - trivial since we are dealing here with a three - dimensional theory , whereas most of our previous studies were in 1 + 1 dimensions . from conformal field theory calculations",
    "one knows that the correlators are simpler in collinear limit @xmath6 , and we will work in this limit .",
    "discretized light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) can be formulated in a way that preserves supersymmetry at each step of calculation @xcite .",
    "namely , one discretizes the supercharge @xmath7 rather than the hamiltonian @xmath8",
    ". this special approach is called supersymmetric dlcq , or sdlcq .",
    "one uses light - cone coordinates @xmath9 where @xmath10 plays the role of a time .",
    "the total longitudinal momentum is denoted by @xmath11 , @xmath8 is the light - cone energy , and @xmath12 the total transverse momentum .",
    "let us now focus on @xmath0 sym(2 + 1 ) .",
    "the action is @xmath13 we decompose the spinor @xmath14 in terms of its projections , @xmath15 , and use the light - cone gauge , @xmath16 .",
    "the advantage of this physical gauge is that we can express everything in terms of the physical degrees of freedom , which are in the present example the fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the light - cone supercharge is a two - component majorana spinor , and is decomposed into the projections @xmath19,\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{sucharge- } q^-&=&2^{3/4}\\int dx^-\\int_0^l dx_\\perp\\mbox{tr}\\left[2\\partial_\\perp\\phi\\psi \\right.\\nonumber\\\\&&\\left .",

    "the periodic boundary condition for the fields dictated by the supersymmetric formulation .",
    "the momentum modes become discrete and we can use the standard fourier expansion for the fields @xmath27 and @xmath17 . with the usual commutation relations the supercharges become @xmath28 dk,\\\\ q^-&{=}&q^-_1+g_{\\rm ym}q^-_2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the exact expressions for @xmath29 are listed in ref .  @xcite . here",
    "it suffices to note that @xmath7 is linear in the coupling @xmath30 .",
    "we want to calculate the spectrum of the theory on the computer , and need therefore finite dimensional representations of these operators .",
    "they are obtained by applying a truncation procedure , which defines the ( finite ) fock basis .",
    "the longitudinal momentum of a particle can take the values @xmath31 , and the transverse components are @xmath32 .",
    "this symmetric truncation ensures the conservation of transverse parity symmetry , which leads to exactly degenerate doublets .",
    "the other symmetry of the theory is the so - called s - symmetry , which is non - degenerate and is related to the orientation of the string of partons in the fock state ; it results in a sign change when the color indices of an operator are flipped .",
    "additionally we have supersymmetry , so we get a total factor of 8 savings in linear matrix size and the density of eigenstates will be much smaller , which allows for a better interpretation of results .",
    "the program is then to construct the supercharge @xmath7 , apply eq .",
    "( [ susyalg ] ) to calculate the hamiltonian @xmath8 by squaring @xmath7 , and to diagonalize @xmath8 to obtain eigenvalues and -functions .",
    "these data go into the calculation of the correlator , which we describe in the next section .",
    "we retrieve the continuum results by solving the system for lager and larger @xmath23 , reaching the continuum limit @xmath33 eventually by extrapolation .",
    "the general expression for a correlator in light - cone formulation is @xmath34 inspired by the simpler structure of correlators in the collinear limit @xmath35 in conformal field theory , we apply the same limit here .",
    "we can evaluate the expression , eq .",
    "( [ expr ] ) , by inserting a complete set @xmath36 with energy eigenvalues @xmath37 @xmath38\\\\ & = & t^{++}_b(x)+t^{++}_f(x)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] its boson and fermion contributions expressed in mode operators are @xmath39 @xmath40 the important thing to notice here is that only the two - particle states contribute to these operators .",
    "it is instructive to consider the free case , because we know from conformal field theory that we should obtain a @xmath2 behavior .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath41 are now a set of free particles with mass @xmath42 .",
    "the four independent sums over quantum numbers are converted to integrals by @xmath43 the evaluation of the bosonic contribution , eq .",
    "( [ bosons ] ) , yields @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "analogously we can evaluate the fermion contribution , eq .",
    "( [ fermions ] ) , and get @xmath46\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we continue to euclidean space by taking @xmath47 to be real . in the small-@xmath3 limit",
    "we recover the @xmath2 behavior @xmath48 expected from conformal field theory .      in the full calculation we use the bound - state solutions obtained from sdlcq and insert them into the expression for the correlator .",
    "it is useful to write @xmath49 and to use the notation @xmath50 with a normalization factor @xmath51 .",
    "we insert the complete set of bound - states @xmath41 with masses @xmath52 .",
    "after some algebra to separate the dependencies on the different length scales in the problem we obtain @xmath53 \\nonumber\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] evaluation of sums over @xmath23 and @xmath54 as integrals yields finally @xmath55 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term in square brackets is basically the overlap of the bound state @xmath41 with the vector @xmath56 .",
    "it is calculated numerically and multiplied by some function of the distance @xmath3 involving the bessel function @xmath57 .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) that we need both the eigenfunctions @xmath41 and the mass eigenvalues @xmath52 to evaluate this expression .",
    "for free particles we have two independent sums over the transverse momenta , and would therefore expect that the transverse dimension be controlled by the dimensional scale of the bound state @xmath58 .",
    "hence , the correlation function should scale like @xmath59 .",
    "because of transverse boost invariance , however , the matrix element are independent of the difference of transverse momenta , and scales like @xmath60 .",
    "at small distances @xmath3 , we expect the correlator to behave like @xmath2 , because at large energies the bound states will look like free particles . eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) on the other hand tells us that each individual bound state behaves like @xmath5 .",
    "we have to have a coherent behavior of all states to get the @xmath2 behavior , and this is a non - trivial check of our results . looking at fig .  [ smallr ] , we observe exactly this behavior .",
    "the constant @xmath5 behavior of the curves at very small distances is caused by numerical artifacts , basically because the largest possible mass in the system is regulated by the transverse cutoff and is not infinite .",
    "the slope of minus unity around @xmath61 gives rise to the correct @xmath2 behavior .",
    "it consistently sets in at smaller @xmath3 for larger cutoffs @xmath23 and @xmath62 .    at large @xmath3 the correlator",
    "is totally determined by the massless states . actually , there are two types of massless states",
    ". the massless states at @xmath63 are reflections of all the states of the dimensionally reduced theory in @xmath64 @xcite@xcite .",
    "they behave as @xmath65 , and for @xmath66 there should be no dependence of the correlator on the transverse momentum cutoff @xmath62 at large @xmath3 .",
    "this is exactly what we find in our calculations , see fig .",
    "[ smallr ] .",
    "secondly , we have states that are exactly massless for all @xmath67 , which are the bps states .",
    "they are actually massless at all resolutions , but have a complicated dependence on the coupling @xmath67 through their wavefunctions . in this way",
    "the correlator gives us information on wavefunctions of the bps states .",
    "surprisingly , we also find a coupling dependence of the large-@xmath3 limit of the correlator , see fig .",
    "[ k5 + 6large ] .",
    "correlator does not change monotonically with @xmath67 , but has singularity at a critical coupling which is a function of @xmath23 and @xmath62 .",
    "if we plot the ` critical ' couplings vs.  @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ linear ] , we find that the coupling is a linear function of @xmath68 at @xmath69 and 6 .",
    "so we would conclude that ` critical ' coupling goes to infinity in the transverse continuum limit .",
    "unfortunately , we see no region dominated by massive bound states , where @xmath3 is large enough to see structure of the bound states but small enough that the correlator is not dominated by massless states .",
    "we presented the first calculation of the correlator of the stress - energy tensor from first principles in three - dimensional @xmath0 sym .",
    "we recovered the @xmath2 behavior of the free particle correlator , also known from conformal field theory .",
    "the individual @xmath5 behaviors of the bound states add up to give this result which is a non - trivial test of our results . at large @xmath3",
    "we found that the bps states depend on the coupling through their wavefunctions , altough their masses stay fixed due to their symmetry properties .",
    "we found a vanishing correlator at some critical coupling @xmath70 , which seems to be a numerical artifact of the discrete approach .",
    "some remarks on the computer code seem in order .",
    "the present code handles two million fock states , and uses all known symmetries in the problem(susy , parity , s - symmetry ) , which in turn gives a factor eight of reduction in the matrix size to be diagonalized .",
    "calculations in 3 + 1 dimensions seem therefore not completely out of reach .",
    "another challenge is the evaluation of the correlator in the @xmath71 version of sym(2 + 1 ) .",
    "this theory is conjectured to correspond to a string theory of d2-branes .",
    "we hope to report on progress in this direction soon , which would establish a further test of a version of the maldacena conjecture .",
