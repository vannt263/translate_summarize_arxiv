    "@xcite and @xcite , whereas a comprehensive analysis of the weak neutral and weak charged current dvcs reactions in collaboration with w.  melnitchouk and a.  radyushkin has been presented in ref .",
    "neutrino scattering off nucleons for neutral and charged currents was also discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the underlying theory of strong interaction physics is the universally accepted nonabelian gauge field theory known as quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the theory postulates that hadrons are composite objects made up of quarks , and that the color interaction between them is mediated by gluons as the gauge bosons . in principle , qcd embraces all phenomena of hadronic physics , in other words , the fundamental building blocks of hadrons ( i.e. quarks and gluons ) are known , and further the interactions between them are described by the well - established qcd lagrangian . nevertheless , knowing the first principles is not sufficient .",
    "the main difficulty is that qcd is formulated in terms of colored degrees - of - freedom , while the physical hadrons observed in the experiments are colorless . how to translate the information obtained from the experiments at the hadronic level into the language of quark and gluon fields has yet to be answered , and it represents a challenging task .",
    "+ one way to tackle this problem is to consider projecting these fields onto the hadronic states , and then use different phenomenological functions ( e.g. form factors , parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , distribution amplitudes and gpds ) to describe the resulting hadronic matrix elements .",
    "the key idea of this approach is the handbag factorization . according to this property , in the specific kinematical regime featuring the presence of a large invariant , such as the virtuality of the probe or the momentum transfer , the amplitude of the process splits into the hard ( short - distance ) part with only one active parton propagating along the light - cone and the soft ( long - distance ) part represented by the lower blob ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ handbag ] .",
    "the asymptotically free nature of qcd allows us to compute the short - distance interactions by means of perturbation theory , whereas the nonperturbative stages of interactions are expressed in terms of well - defined quark - gluon operators taken on the light - cone , and being sandwiched between the hadronic states .",
    "these matrix elements , which accumulate the information about the long - distance dynamics of the process , are process independent nonperturbative objects .",
    "thus they are parametrized in terms of universal phenomenological functions , and they can be measured with the help of different probes ( e.g. photons and weak interaction bosons ) .",
    "+ there are several situations , where the handbag contribution plays an essential role :    * both initial and final photons are highly virtual and have equal space - like virtualities .",
    "this situation corresponds to the forward virtual compton scattering amplitude .",
    "its imaginary part , through the optical theorem , determines the structure functions of deeply inelastic lepton scattering ( dis ) . *",
    "the condition on photon virtualities may be relaxed in a sense that the initial photon is still far off - shell but the final photon is real and the invariant momentum transfer to the hadron is small .",
    "the situation corresponds to the nonforward virtual compton scattering amplitude , which is accessible through processes such as deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) and deeply virtual meson production . * the configuration , in which both photons in the initial and final states are real but the invariant momentum transfer is large .",
    "the physical process corresponding to this situation is known as wide - angle real compton scattering .",
    "the description of specific aspects of the hadron structure is provided by several different phenomenological functions .",
    "the well - known examples are the so - called old phenomenological functions such as form factors , pdfs and distribution amplitudes since they have been around for a long time . on the other hand ,",
    "the concept of gpds is new .",
    "these new functions , as hybrids of the old ones , provide the most complete information about the hadron structure .",
    "in fact , the old phenomenological functions are just the limiting case of gpds . like pdfs , gpds encapsulate longitudinal momentum distributions of hadron s constituents , however , at the same time , like form factors , they also provide the information about their transverse coordinate distributions , and hence give a comprehensive three - dimensional snapshot of the substructure of the hadron",
    ". moreover , the universality of gpds enables one to develop a unified description of wide variety of different hard ( i.e. light - cone dominated ) processes , both inclusive and exclusive . + in the symmetric partonic picture , see fig .",
    "[ partonicpicture ] , we treat both the initial and final hadron momenta symmetrically by introducing the average hadron momentum @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath1 is the usual light - cone momentum fraction .",
    "in addition , another scaling variable is introduced , the so- called skewness @xmath2 .",
    "it is defined as the coefficient of the proportionality between the light - cone plus components of the momentum transfer , @xmath3 , and average hadron momentum , @xmath4 , and it specifies the longitudinal momentum asymmetry . clearly , in the skewed ( nonforward )",
    "kinematics gpds uncover much richer information about the hadron structure , which is not accessible in dis , or in general in any inclusive process . by removing the parton with the light - cone momentum fraction @xmath5 from the hadron , and replacing it at some later point on the light - cone with the parton of fraction @xmath6 , gpds measure the coherence between the two parton momentum states in the hadron as well as their spin correlations .",
    "finally , by considering two different hadrons in the initial and final states one can study flavor nondiagonal gpds , for example , in the proton - to - neutron transition accessible through the exclusive charged pion electroproduction , the proton - to-@xmath7 transition in the kaon electroproduction or the nucleon - to-@xmath8 transition .",
    "+    since @xmath9 , the momentum fractions @xmath10 of the active partons can be either positive or negative , and for that reason gpds have three distinct regions .",
    "when @xmath11 both partons represent quarks , while for @xmath12 they are both antiquarks . in these two regions gpds",
    "are just a generalization of pdfs . in the central region , @xmath13 , which is often referred to as the mesonic region ,",
    "the partons represent the quark - antiquark pair . here",
    "gpds behave like meson distribution amplitudes .",
    "+ at the leading twist-2 level , the hadron structure information can be parametrized in terms of two unpolarized and two polarized gpds denoted by @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "they are functions of three variables @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the invatiant momentum transfer , and further they are defined for each quark flavor @xmath20 .",
    "gpds have interesting properties linking them to pdfs and form factors . in the forward limit , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , they reduce to pdfs . in particular ,",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 coincide with the quark density distribution @xmath27 and the quark helicity distribution @xmath28 .",
    "we write the so - called reduction formulas , @xmath29 and @xmath30 while @xmath31 and @xmath32 have no connections to pdfs .",
    "they are always accompanied with the momentum transfer , and hence simply not visible in dis . even though they have no analogue in the forward limit their limits",
    "do exist . in the local limit",
    "gpds reduce to the standard nucleon elastic form factors ( i.e. dirac , pauli , axial and pseudoscalar form factors ) , @xmath33 we call these relations the sum rules .",
    "+ gpds in general are also relevant for the hadron spin structure . in terms of gpds their second moments at @xmath24",
    "give the quark total angular momentum , @xmath34 .",
    "\\label{eq : quarkangularmomentum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , by decomposing @xmath35 into the quark intrinsic spin @xmath36 ( measured through polarized dis ) and quark orbital angular momentum @xmath37 , @xmath38 , we can access @xmath37 .",
    "finally , since the total nucleon spin comes from quarks and gluons , @xmath39 , we can extract the total angular momentum @xmath40 carried by gluons .",
    "in recent years , significant effort was made to study gpds through measurements of hard exclusive electroproduction processes .",
    "the simplest process in this respect is the standard electromagnetic dvcs process .",
    "complementary to dvcs different combinations of quark flavors can be accessed by utilizing the weak interaction current in neutrino - induced dvcs ( or , alternatively deeply virtual neutrino scattering - dvns ) , namely @xmath41 for the charged current , and @xmath42 for neutral current reactions .",
    "the presence of the axial part of the @xmath43 interaction enables to probe a different set of gpds , i.e. the charge conjugation odd combinations of gpds as well as charge conjugation even combinations and hence independently measure both the valence and sea content of gpds .",
    "furthermore , one deals with a different flavor decomposition , in particular , less enhancement from @xmath44-quarks .",
    "an additional feature of the dvns process is the study of gpds that are not diagonal in quark flavors , such as those associated with the neutron - to - proton transition . + in the most general case , there are three relevant diagrams for a dvcs - like process , see fig .  [ dvns ] . the nucleon blob with the boson leg , which can be either a virtual photon or weak interaction boson , and photon leg represents the virtual compton scattering amplitude .",
    "this diagram is referred to as the dvcs diagram or the compton contribution .",
    "the real photon can also be emitted by a lepton as depicted in the remaining two diagrams .",
    "they illustrate the bethe - heitler process , where the lower blob with one boson leg stands for the electroweak form factor , while the upper part in each diagram can be exactly calculable in qed .",
    "+    in the bjorken regime , in which the virtuality of the weak boson @xmath45 and the invariant mass of the weak boson - nucleon system , @xmath46 , are both sufficiently large while the bjorken ratio @xmath47 $ ] is kept finite , the behavior of the virtual compton scattering amplitude is dominated by the light - like distances .",
    "the dominant light - cone singularities are represented by two ( @xmath48- and @xmath44-channel ) handbag diagrams , see fig .",
    "[ dvnshandbag ] , in which the hard quark propagator is convoluted with gpds .",
    "in addition , by keeping the invariant momentum transfer to the nucleon as small as possible we arrive at the so - called dvcs kinematics , @xmath49 .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath50-dependence enters only in the soft part of the amplitude .",
    "+    in our case in terms of symmetric momentum variables , @xmath0 and @xmath51 , the virtual compton scattering amplitude is given by the fourier transform of the correlation function of the electromagnetic and weak ( neutral or charged ) interaction currents , @xmath52 the weak current couples to the quark current through two types of vertices , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and hence the quark fields at coordinates @xmath55 can either have the same or different flavor quantum numbers .",
    "for that reason , we treat these two cases separately . the method employed to study the amplitude ( [ eq : reducedamplitude ] ) in the dvcs kinematics",
    "is based on the nonlocal light - cone expansion of the time - ordered product of currents in terms of qcd bilocal operators in coordinate space @xcite , @xmath56\\right.\\nonumber \\\\ &   & \\left.-\\ c_{a}^{f}\\left[s^{\\mu\\rho\\nu\\eta}\\mathcal{o}_{5\\eta}^{f- } \\left(z\\left|0\\right.\\right)-i\\epsilon^{\\mu\\rho\\nu\\eta } \\mathcal{o}_{\\eta}^{f+}\\left(z\\left|0\\right.\\right)\\right]\\right\\}\\ , \\label{eq : weakneutralexpansion2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 denotes the electric charge of the quark with flavor @xmath20 ( in units of @xmath58 ) , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the corresponding weak vector and axial vector charges , @xmath61 is the symmetric tensor and @xmath62 the antisymmetric tensor in lorentz indices ( @xmath63 ) , and further @xmath64\\ , \\\\",

    "explicily presented here , the expansion for the weak charged and electromagnetic currents is a bit more complicated due to the fact that @xmath65 carries an electric charge .",
    "thus we end up with different nucleons in the initial and final states and accordingly , the bilocal operators are accompanied with different electric charges as well as flavors .",
    "+ next we isolate the twist-2 part of these operators , and sandwich it between the initial and final nucleon states . to construct the parametrization for nonforward matrix elements on the light - cone",
    ", we use a spectral representation in terms of eight gpds , which have well - defined symmetry properties with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , in case of the weak neutral current we have @xmath66 in contrast to the electromagnetic dvcs process , which measures only the _ plus _ gpds ( i.e. the sum of quark and antiquark distributions ) , the dvns process gives also access to the _ minus _ distributions ( i.e. the valence configuration ) associated with the axial part of the @xmath43 interaction .",
