    "the search for matter field solutions in general relativity started with schwarzschild @xcite who studied a perfect fluid with spherically symmetric energy density distribution given by @xmath5 and pressure @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the radial coordinate , for a constant energy equation of state , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 a constant , matched to a static spherically symmetric vacuum exterior spacetime .",
    "the exterior solution is the schwarzschild solution , while the whole solution , comprised of the interior plus exterior , is called the schwarzschild interior solution @xcite .",
    "schwarzschild also obtained a compactness limit , the interior schwarzschild limit .",
    "he showed @xcite that at @xmath4 the central pressure becomes infinite , and for smaller @xmath1 there is no central pressure that can sustain the configuration , and it presumably collapses , where @xmath1 is the radius of the configuration and @xmath0 its mass .",
    "tolman @xcite and oppenheimer and volkoff @xcite then discussed in detail the structure of those matter field equations by writing the pressure gradient field in a convenient form , now called the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation .",
    "volkoff @xcite and then misner in his lectures @xcite showed how the schwarzschild interior solution can be extracted directly from the tov equation and rederived the limit of @xmath4 as had been found by schwarzschild @xcite . nowadays , standard texts in general relativity exhibit the schwarzschild interior solution and its limit .",
    "a constant density equation of state for a fluid in a star is certainly interesting not only from a historical perspective .",
    "notably , a constant density is achieved when the matter is negligibly compressible and can sustain huge pressures .",
    "this happens when the velocities of the matter particles become relativistic , i.e. , when the temperatures are of the order of the particles rest mass if the matter is composed of bosons , or when the fermi levels are again of the order of the particles rest mass if the matter is composed of fermions .",
    "this means that in both cases the densities approach one particle per cubic compton wavelength .",
    "in addition , it is from an incompressible equation of state that one extracts the important compactness schwarzschild limit , which can then be compared with other compactness bounds , and the results give a clean and robust picture .",
    "of course , an incompressible equation of state also has some drawbacks , as the speed of sound through such a medium is infinite , although this does not have a major influence in the overall structure .",
    "there are many other equations of state that can be used to study compact stars .",
    "indeed , for instance , oppenheimer and volkoff @xcite applied the method to study compact neutron stars , stars that do not obey an incompressible equation of state .",
    "as expected then , the most compact neutron stars are not as compact as the interior schwarzschild limit allows .",
    "buchdahl @xcite took further interest in general relativistic equilibrium and proved that , under certain conditions , a spherically symmetric matter configuration could only exist when the radius @xmath1 of the configuration divided by its mass @xmath0 satisfies the relation @xmath10 .",
    "the result is quite general . indeed",
    "the only assumptions for providing this result are that the fluid s energy density @xmath11 is non - negative and decreasing outward , and the pressure @xmath12 is non - negative and isotropic , i.e. , the fluid is perfect , and the boundary defined by @xmath13 is matched to the exterior schwarzschild solution .",
    "the inequality is a compactness bound , the buchdahl bound , and the value @xmath4 is the buchdahl limit .",
    "it is a limit of limits .",
    "it also means a star made of such a fluid can not approach its own gravitational radius @xmath14 and so trapped surfaces are eliminated . although derived from completely different means , the interior schwarzschild limit ( i.e. , the limit of infinite central pressure for incompressible spheres ) @xcite and the buchdahl limit ( i.e. , the limit for perfect fluids obeying reasonable physical conditions ) @xcite coincide , and so the interior schwarzschild solution with infinite pressure saturates the buchdahl bound and , thus , realizes the buchdahl limit .",
    "the interest of adding electric charge to the matter in writing the tov equation was understood by bekenstein in @xcite . indeed ,",
    "although a significant excess of electric charge in stars is unlikely , its study in stars is of great interest since it mimics other fields and possible alterations in the gravitational field as proposed in alternative theories of gravity . perhaps , the most simple electric star is a star with a schwarzschild incompressible interior with some type of added electric charge distribution . adding electric charge to these configurations",
    "can bring some insight to their overall structure in more complex situations .",
    "thus , in this spirit and sticking to incompressible fluids , de felice and collaborators @xcite studied the structure of electric stars with a power - law charge distribution @xmath15 of the form @xmath16 , for some exponent @xmath17 , total charge @xmath2 , and star s radius @xmath1 , matching the solutions , at the star s boundary , to the reissner - nordstrm solution for the given star s mass @xmath0 , radius @xmath1 , and charge @xmath2 .",
    "numerical techniques were used .",
    "they also analyzed the most compact stars for each @xmath2 .",
    "anninos and rothman @xcite also studied incompressible fluids with somewhat more intricate charge distributions .",
    "now , in the case the radius @xmath1 of the charged star is taken to the gravitational radius of the star itself , the configuration is called a quasiblack hole . it is an extremal configuration . in this extremal configuration the total electric charge of",
    "the star @xmath2 is equal to the star s",
    "mass @xmath0 , @xmath18 , and the configuration has a radius @xmath1 equal to its own gravitational radius @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "this configuration is highly compact and is a limit for the case @xmath18 . in @xcite",
    "such configurations were detected .",
    "the stability of physical system , in particular of electrically charged stars , is always of importance .",
    "an analysis of the stability of such stars against radial perturbations has been performed in @xcite with the conclusion that for a range of the star parameters , and depending on how stiff the perturbed matter is , these systems can be stable .",
    "there has also been interest in finding a buchdahl electric limit formula which started in the works @xcite . in @xcite , among other cases studied , the @xmath8 solution , with @xmath9 a constant , with the @xmath21 power - law distribution for the charge given in @xcite , was revisited with the aim of finding the most compact configuration and a buchdahl electric limit formula . up to now ,",
    "the sharpest bound has been given by andrasson @xcite .",
    "this buchdahl - andrasson bound for electrically charged matter is taken from the condition @xmath22 , where @xmath12 and @xmath23 are the radial and tangential pressures , respectively , and some other reasonable physical conditions @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath24 .",
    "surprisingly , although derived from completely different hypotheses , the buchdahl bound for the uncharged @xmath25 case @xmath10 is reobtained .",
    "it also gives the quasiblack hole limit , for @xmath26 one obtains @xmath20 , and so @xmath18 also .",
    "charged shells saturate the buchdahl - andrasson bound @xcite , whereas the @xmath8 solution , with @xmath9 a constant , and @xmath27 of @xcite do not , as noticed in @xcite .",
    "presumably , the whole set of solutions found in @xcite also does not saturate generically the buchdahl - andrasson bound .",
    "motivated by these settings we want to further investigate relativistic stars made of an incompressible fluid , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being a constant . in order to probe the genericity of the results mentioned above we will assume a new charge distribution @xmath15 ,",
    "namely , we take the electric charge density @xmath28 as proportional to the energy density , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 a number obeying @xmath31 .",
    "this is a possible assumption as one might think that the net charge is inherent to each particle , having arisen from some physical consorted process . then the charged distribution @xmath15 is taken from the maxwell field equation @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the @xmath34 component of the spacetime metric .",
    "this gives a @xmath15 different from the ones considered in @xcite , namely , @xmath16 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "other @xmath15 distributions can be thought of , such as one that has most of the charge at or near the core of the star .",
    "here we stick to @xmath29 .",
    "we then analyze the structure of such spheres and study the compactness bounds , namely , we numerically probe the electric interior schwarzschild limit with an electric charge @xmath2 within the range @xmath35 and compare the results to the buchdahl - andrasson bound @xcite .",
    "we also study the quasiblack hole limit @xmath36 of this set of configurations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there are equations of state , other than an incompressible one , that can be used in the study of electrically charged stars and that should be mentioned .",
    "for instance , cooperstock and de la cruz @xcite and florides @xcite used an equation of the form @xmath37 and studied some properties of the solutions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "polytropic equations were used in @xcite , where star configurations and their structure were studied , and the schwarzschild electric limit for the given equation of state and for a given charge was considered .",
    "there are also works that treat a quark deconfining phase in compact neutron stars @xcite , where an unbalance of electric or color charge might appear . these works @xcite stayed away from the extremal quasiblack hole configuration .",
    "works that did consider the schwarzschild electric limit and the quasiblack hole limit are ( i ) works that analyzed the cooperstock - de la cruz - florides equation of state @xcite as in @xcite , ( ii ) works that used a generic polytropic equation of state with any exponent as in @xcite , ( iii ) works with a dust equation of state , i.e. , where the fluid is composed of purely extremal charged matter , also called electrically counterpoised matter , where static equilibrium configurations at the quasiblack hole limit , with @xmath18 and @xmath20 were found @xcite , ( iv ) works that in addition to the electric charge have a scalar charge @xcite , and of course ( v ) works with an incompressible equation of state @xcite as mentioned before , to name a sample . note that some works , e.g. @xcite , have been calling the buchdahl limit what should in fact be named the interior schwarzschild limit .",
