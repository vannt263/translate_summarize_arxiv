    "the most classical sn impostors are thought to be the eruptions of extragalactic luminous blue variables ( lbvs , * ? ? ?",
    "they may experience eruptions with comparable energies as those of real sne , but the stars survive the eruptive events .",
    "+ lbvs are evolved , massive stars very close to the classical eddington limit , showing irregular outbursts and , occasionally , even giant eruptions during which they lose massive portions of their h - rich envelope ( up to a few solar masses per episode ) . in quiescence",
    "they are blue stars located in the so called ` s doradus instability strip ' of the hr diagram , namely in the luminosity - temperature range @xmath3 m@xmath4 @xmath511 and 14000  k @xmath6 t@xmath7 @xmath6 35000  k . during eruptive episodes lbvs become redder and evolve with a roughly constant bolometric magnitude .",
    "however , it has been proposed that they may increase their bolometric luminosity during giant eruptions @xcite .",
    "active lbvs show quite erratic variability and , sometimes , fast optical luminosity declines after the outburst , possibly because of prompt dust formation in the circum - stellar environment .",

    "their spectra share some similarity with those of type iin sne , with prominent and narrow hydrogen lines in emission @xcite .",
    "+ sn impostors are believed to be extra - galactic counterparts of the famous ` giant eruption ' of the galactic lbv @xmath9 carinae in the mid-19th century .",
    "this , together with the eruption of p cygni in the 17th century , are the only two major eruptions registered in the milky way in recent times .",
    "however , weaker eruptions were occasionally observed in the past either in the milky way ( e.g. ag car ) or in the local group ( e.g. s  doradus in the lmc , * ? ? ?",
    "these nearby examples are fundamental to our understanding of the nature of eruptive phenomena since their physical parameters are well constrained , and give us the opportunity to demonstrate that these stars survive major eruptions .",
    "it has been argued that a connection may exist between interacting sne and impostors , mainly based on the observed similarity in the spectra , although they usually have remarkably different photometric properties .",
    "even more importantly , there is evidence ( though debated ) that lbvs or other massive stars may explode as real interacting sne soon after major outbursts ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we also adopt no additional host galaxy extinction contribution in the transient direction , since a detailed analysis of the spectra of 2007sv revealed no evidence of narrow absorptions of the naid doublet at the recessional velocity of the host galaxy . + a rough estimate of the metallicity of the host galaxy can be obtained from the relation of : @xmath18 that links the integrated absolute _",
