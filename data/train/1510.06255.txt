    "+ @xmath176 forms a convex @xmath1-gon .",
    "this holds since @xmath162 is to the right of @xmath151 , to the left of @xmath121 and above @xmath168 .",
    "+ so , according to the definition [ good ] , @xmath151 is an @xmath148-convexifying point for @xmath24 .",
    "the second part can be proved in the same way as the second part in the theorem [ m,4 ] , either by following that proof or using that result with symmetry in order to replace cups with caps .",
    "[ h ]    now we combine the theorems [ m,4 ] , [ 4,l ] with lemma [ subadd ] in order to get the following bound on the convexification function @xmath15 .",
    "[ boundgood ] for any natural numbers @xmath182 , we have @xmath183    first define the function @xmath184 as @xmath185 so we need to show that @xmath186 , for all @xmath187 .",
    "we apply double induction on @xmath18 and @xmath51 . for the induction basis ,",
    "suppose @xmath188 .",
    "then according to theorem [ 4,l ] we have @xmath189 similarly , the other induction basis @xmath190 can be proved by using theorem [ m,4 ] .",
    "now suppose the inequality holds for @xmath94 and @xmath191 , we prove it for @xmath89 . note that based on the identity @xmath192 we can get that @xmath193 by lemma [ subadd ] we have @xmath194 where the last inequality holds according to the induction hypothesis .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "in this section , we prove the main result of this paper , theorem [ main ] . we start with the following lemma which we need for theorem [ f+g ] .",
    "[ f+g ] let @xmath13 be a natural number and consider the set @xmath24 of @xmath201 points in the plane , where the function @xmath202 is defined in theorem [ boundgood ]",
    ". then @xmath24 contains an @xmath78-cap or a convex @xmath1-gon .",
    "consider the partition of @xmath24 into the upper and lower subsets @xmath203 as in the definition [ ul ] .",
    "if @xmath204 , then it either contains an @xmath78-cup or an @xmath78-cap . in the former case , we get an @xmath1-cup by the lemma [ ext ] , and in the latter case , we are immediately done .",
    "so we can assume that @xmath205 .",
    "on the other hand , we can assume that @xmath39 is @xmath206-free , since otherwise we are immediately done or again by lemma [ ext ] .",
    "we have @xmath207 where the last term is positive .",
    "so by applying theorem [ boundgood ] iteratively , we get @xmath208 @xmath206-convexifying points for @xmath39 .",
    "denote the set of these convexifying points by @xmath209 .",
    "consider the set @xmath210 .",
    "we have @xmath211 so it must contain either an @xmath78-cup or an @xmath78-cap . in the latter case ,",
    "we are done . in the former case , denote this @xmath78-cup by @xmath212 .",
    "if @xmath213 , by the lemma [ ext ] we get an @xmath1-cup in @xmath24 , which means we are done . on the other hand ,",
    "every point of @xmath209 is the leftmost point of an @xmath214-cap in @xmath39 , which by lemma [ ext ] , can be extended to an @xmath77-cap in @xmath24 by adding a point to the right of it .",
    "so if @xmath215 , then by lemma [ extt ] , we either get an @xmath1-cup or an @xmath78-cap , which finishes the proof .",
    "[ @xcite , @xcite ] [ pt ] define @xmath218 to be the minimum natural number such that every set with at least @xmath218 points in the plane contains either an @xmath78-cap or a convex @xmath1-gon",
    ". then we have @xmath219    let @xmath24 be a set of @xmath220 points in the plane .",
    "we have to show that @xmath24 contains @xmath1 points in convex position .",
    "let @xmath28 be a vertex of the convex hull of @xmath24 , @xmath221 , and take the point @xmath29 outside @xmath221 such that none of the lines spanned by the points of @xmath222 intersects the segment @xmath223 .",
    "also , take a line @xmath51 through @xmath29 which does not intersect @xmath221 .",
    "now consider the projective transformation taking the line @xmath51 to the line at infinity and also mapping the segment @xmath223 to the vertical half - line emanating downwards from @xmath224 .",
    "since the line @xmath51 avoided @xmath221 , @xmath225 does not change convexity on the points of @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath226 is in convex position if and only if @xmath227 is in convex position .",
    "one can see that none of the lines spanned by the points of @xmath228 intersects the vertical half - line emanating downwards from @xmath224 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath228 is a non - vertical set .",
    "so for any natural number @xmath51 , any @xmath51-cap in @xmath228 can be extended to a convex @xmath53-gon by adding the point @xmath224 .",
    "therefore , because @xmath229 , we have @xmath230 , and by the definition of the function @xmath218 , we get that @xmath228 must contain either an @xmath78-cap or a convex @xmath1-gon",
    ". based on what was stated before , @xmath231 contains a convex @xmath1-gon , and as a result , @xmath24 contains a convex @xmath1-gon , as well .",
