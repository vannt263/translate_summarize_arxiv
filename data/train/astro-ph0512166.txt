    "galaxy clustering is a tool for the study of a diverse set of phenomena at different scales . on large scales ( @xmath11 )",
    "the density perturbations are small enough to be described in a linear framework , allowing analysis of cosmological models in detail and constraints on cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent studies have used extremely large - scale galaxy clustering to test fundamental cosmological hypotheses , such as homogeneity of the universe @xcite and flatness of the universe @xcite .    on intermediate scales",
    "( @xmath12 to @xmath13 ) , galaxy clustering probes the relation of galaxies to dark matter through the biased clustering of dark matter halos . on these scales",
    "the two - point correlation function is found to be very close to a power law .",
    "recent work has shown that the observed small deviations of the correlation function from a power - law on these scales can be interpreted in the framework of the halo occupation distribution ( hod ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a natural transition between galaxy pairs within a single virialized halo and galaxy pairs in separate halos ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    on sufficiently small scales within a halo ( @xmath14 )",
    ", galaxy clustering will probe more than just the properties of the dark matter . on these scales",
    "one expects a variety of more complex processes to modify the galaxy clustering and thus presumably give rise to features in the correlation function @xmath2 .",
    "these processes include dynamical friction , tidal interactions , stellar feedback and other dissipative processes .",
    "these processes will force close galaxy pairs to merge over time - scales of order of the dynamical time ( @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "thus measurements of the correlation function @xmath2 on small scales can be translated to a number density of near - future merger events .",
    "some understanding of the merger process can be used to turn this density into a galaxy merger rate or at least a constraint thereon , providing an empirical measure of the importance of mergers as a fundamental mode of stellar mass addition to galaxies .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations within the cold dark matter paradigm find that self - bound substructures within dark matter halos ( subhalos ) merge to form larger systems .",
    "it is tempting to associate these subhalos with galaxies in groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "comparison between galaxy clustering and subhalo clustering on very small scales can lead to a better understanding of the connection between galaxies and dark matter subhalos @xcite .",
    "there are no measurements of the real - space correlation function on scales smaller than @xmath16 .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that on small angular separations the selection function of typical surveys becomes too complex and the pair counts are limited by shot noise . @xcite and",
    "@xcite measured the angular correlation function for angular separations that , for the median redshift of their sample translates to @xmath17 .",
    "they both find that the correlation function @xmath2 power law extends down to these small scales .",
    "the drawback of these studies is that they measure only angular , not proper correlations , and they are difficult to interpret without precise knowledge of the radial selection function and density field .    the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ?",
    "* ) has provided the largest spectroscopic sample ever of these massive galaxies ; its special luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) target selection @xcite uses color to pre - select luminous early - type galaxies in a volume much larger than that of the sdss main sample .",
    "because of their high luminosities , their association with massive halos , and their spectral uniformity , lrgs are extremely useful probes of large - scale structure .",
    "in addition , however , their morphological simplicity makes it straightforward to study their clustering at very small scales ; their lack of cold gas ( and , indeed , the lack of equally bright blue galaxies ) means that close passages and mergers do not trigger significant star formation , change the colors significantly , or change the morphology significantly , and therefore do not `` remove '' systems of interest at small scales from the parent sample . in this paper",
    "we capitalize on these properties of the lrgs  and the enormous volume of the sdss lrg sample  to measure the clustering to extremely small scales ( @xmath18 ) and to constrain the lrg ",
    "lrg merger rate .    throughout this paper all distances",
    "are comoving , calculated for a cosmological world model with @xmath19 and hubble constant parameterized by @xmath20 . at the mean redshift of the sample ( @xmath21 ) ,",
    "the fiber collision scale , @xmath5 , corresponds to @xmath22 and the sdss median psf width , @xmath23 , translates to @xmath24 .",
    "the sdss @xcite is conducting an imaging survey of @xmath25 square degrees in 5 bandpasses : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath8 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "photometric monitoring @xcite , image processing @xcite , and good photometric calibration @xcite allow one to select galaxies @xcite , quasars @xcite , and stars for spectroscopic observations with the twin fiber - fed double - spectrographs .",
    "targets are assigned to spectroscopic fiber plug plates with a tiling algorithm that ensures nearly complete samples @xcite .",
    "the angular completeness is characterized carefully for each unique region of overlapping spectroscopic plates ( `` sector '' ) on the sky .",
    "an operational constraint of sdss spectrographs is that the physical size of the fiber coupling forces the angular separation of the targets to be larger than @xmath5 .",
    "this  fiber collision ",
    "constraint is partly reduced by having roughly one third of the sky covered by overlapping plates , but it still results in @xmath30 of targeted galaxies not having measured redshifts .",
    "we focus here on the luminous red galaxy spectroscopic sample @xcite .",
    "this sample is constructed from color - magnitude cuts in @xmath27 , @xmath8 , and @xmath28 to select galaxies that are likely to be luminous early - type galaxies at redshifts between 0.15 and 0.5 .",
    "the selection is highly efficient and the redshift success rate is excellent .",
    "the sample is constructed to be close to volume - limited up to @xmath31 , with a dropoff in density toward @xmath32 .",
    "this study uses a sample drawn from nyu lss sample14 @xcite and covers 3,836 square degrees containing 55,000 lrgs between redshift of 0.16 and 0.47 .",
    "the subsample of lrgs used in this paper has luminosity and redshift ranges of @xmath33 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the absolute magnitudes include galactic extinction corrections @xcite , @xmath34-corrections and passive evolution corrections to redshift @xmath35 .",
    "this subsample , which is chosen to maximize our use of the volume - limited portion of the lrg spectroscopic sample , is identical to the first subsample ( 29298 galaxies ) used in @xcite , with the difference that in this paper we limit ourself only to the north galactic cap ( 24520 galaxies ) .",
    "this is due to the slight difference in some aspects of tiling and photometric calibrations between the north and south galactic cap areas .",
    "the details of the radial and angular selection functions are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we create large catalogs of randomly distributed points based on these angular and radial models .",
    "these catalogs match the redshift distribution of the lrgs and are isotropic within the survey region .",
    "these catalogs allow us to check the survey completeness of any given volume and provide a homogeneous baseline ( e.g. , expected numbers ) for the tests that follow .",
    "to calculate the real - space correlation function on intermediate scales , one estimates the correlation function on a two - dimensional grid of pair separations parallel ( @xmath36 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath37 ) to the line of sight , termed @xmath38 .",
    "this can be turned into projected correlation function    @xmath39    in which @xmath40 is set to a value sufficiently large to include most correlated pairs and give stable results ( i.e. , independent of the choice of @xmath40 with in the error - bars ) . using this method , @xcite",
    "calculate @xmath1 for the lrg sample in the range @xmath41 .",
    "the lower limit in the @xcite analysis was set to eliminate the incompleteness effects that are introduced by the @xmath5 fiber collision radius .",
    "we overcome the fiber collision problem by cross correlating the spectroscopic sample with the full sample of lrg targets in the sdss imaging , whether or not they have observed redshifts .",
    "to do this we use the @xcite subsample of lrgs ( as explained above ) as our spectroscopic sample , and _ all _ lrg targets as our imaging sample . for each lrg from the spectroscopic sample , we treat the nearby imaging lrgs ( whether they have spectrum or not ) as if they are at the same redshift as the spectroscopically observed lrg .",
    "this allows us to calculate a @xmath27-band absolute magnitude ( @xmath42 ) for them in the same manner as the lrgs with spectra and choose the ones that make it inside the sample limits ( e.g. , @xmath33 ) .",
    "this turns our cross - correlation into an auto - correlation .",
    "in addition , assuming the lrg redshift we can bin the pairs according to their comoving projected separation .",
    "we statistically remove the interlopers , i.e. , galaxies not at the same redshift but treated as such by the algorithm , by making random spectroscopic samples with the same redshift distribution as lrg spectroscopic sample and cross - correlating this sample with the imaging lrg sample .",
    "we subtract the scaled random interlopers from our data - data correlation .",
    "this method makes use of the fact that essentially all the support for the projected correlation function @xmath43 integral ( [ eq : wp ] ) arises from line - of - sight separations @xmath36 that are much smaller than the distance to the given galaxy .",
    "the downside to this method is the loss of signal - to - noise due to interlopers , which becomes irrelevant at small - scales , where the correlation function becomes much larger than unity .    using this method we calculate @xmath1 ; schematically : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the average comoving density of the spectroscopic lrg sample used here , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the spectroscopic and imaging data samples , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the random spectroscopic and random imaging samples . in detail , the factors are :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the weight given to each spectroscopic lrg to account for the fiber collisions .",
    "we calculate this weight by running a friends - of - friends grouping algorithm with a @xmath5 linking length provided within sample14 package . within each `` collision group '' made by the friends - of friends we find the number of objects that with spectroscopic redshifts and divide by the total number .",
    "the inverse of this ratio is the weighting @xmath51 assigned to each spectroscopic lrg .",
    "this procedure emulates the sdss tiling algorithm @xcite .",
    "@xmath52    where @xmath53 is the inverse square of the comoving distance to spectroscopic galaxy @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the number density of the random imaging catalog per solid angle .",
    "the average of multiplication of these two terms gives the average number of random imaging objects per unit comoving area around each spectroscopic galaxy .",
    "@xmath56    where @xmath57 is the weight given to spectroscopic galaxy @xmath54 which accounts for the incompleteness of the spectroscopic survey in that region of the sky _ not _ due to fiber collision but due to all the other selection effects in survey .",
    "the sample14 package provides the angular geometry of the spectroscopic survey expressed in terms of spherical polygons .",
    "the geometry is complicated : the spectroscopic plates are circular and overlap , while the imaging is in long strips on the sky , and there are some overlap regions of certain plates that may not have been yet observed .",
    "the resulting spherical polygons track all these effects and characterize the geometry in terms of `` sectors '' , each being a unique region of overlapping spectroscopic plates . in each sector",
    ", we count the number of possible targets ( lrg , main , and quasar ) , excluding those missed because of fiber collisions , and the number of these whose redshifts were determined .",
    "we weight the random spectroscopic lrgs by the inverse of the ratio of these numbers ( @xmath57 ) . in truth ,",
    "the priority of all targets are not equal , such that lrgs will always lose to quasar candidates , but the lrg priority is equal to the dominant main targets . only about @xmath58 of the fibers",
    "are assigned to quasars , hence quasar lrg collisions are rare and this priority bias could be ignored .",
    "@xmath59    is similar to equation [ eq : secterm ] but for the random spectroscopic and random imaging pairs .",
    "figure  [ fig : w_rp ] shows the projected correlation function measured in this manner ( data in table [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "the error - bars are estimated using jackknife resampling covariance matrix with 50 subsamples.these results agree well with @xcite on their overlap range ( @xmath12 to @xmath60 ) and on smaller scales ( @xmath61 to @xmath62 ) is very close to an extension of the best - fit power - law from @xcite .      to test our method",
    ", we use an n - body simulation of a @xmath63cdm cosmological model , with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "this model is in good agreement with a wide variety of cosmological observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "initial conditions were set up using the transfer function calculated for this cosmological model by cmbfast @xcite .",
    "the simulation was run at los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) using the hashed - oct - tree ( hot ) code @xcite ; the simulation followed the evolution of @xmath70 dark matter particles , each of mass @xmath71 , in a comoving box of size @xmath72 .",
    "the gravitational force softening is @xmath73 ( plummer equivalent ) . we identify halos in the dark matter particle distributions using a friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking length equal to @xmath74 times the mean inter - particle separation .",
    "we populate these halos with galaxies using a simple model for the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) .",
    "every halo with a mass @xmath75 greater than a minimum mass @xmath76 is assigned a central galaxy that is placed at the halo center of mass and is given the mean halo velocity . a number of satellite galaxies is then drawn from a poisson distribution with mean @xmath77 , for @xmath78 .",
    "these satellite galaxies are assigned the positions and velocities of randomly selected dark matter particles within the halo .",
    "we select the parameter values @xmath79 ,",
    "@xmath80 , and @xmath81 that yield a mock galaxy population with the observed space density of lrgs and approximately the correct galaxy - galaxy correlation function .",
    "in order to carve the sdss lrg sample geometry out of our mock cube , we create a new cube with 27 times larger volume by tiling the mock cube @xmath82 .",
    "since the n - body simulation used to construct the mock was run with periodic boundary conditions , we can tile the cube without having density discontinuities at the boundaries .",
    "we set the center of this tiled cube to be the origin and put galaxies into redshift space using the line - of - sight component of their peculiar velocities .",
    "we then compute ra , dec , and redshift coordinates for every mock galaxy in the tiled cube .",
    "finally , we only keep galaxies whose coordinates would place them within the lrg sample geometry .",
    "the final step in creating a mock lrg catalog is to incorporate the fiber collision constraint . in the sdss ,",
    "lrg fibers collide both with each other , and with other galaxies that are mostly uncorrelated foreground galaxies .",
    "we create a foreground screen of mock galaxies on the sky by populating the same n - body simulation with a different hod that yields an angular correlation function equal to the mean for all sdss galaxies .",
    "we then allow all galaxies to collide with each other and keep track of collided mock lrg galaxies .",
    "this approach produces results that are very close to the sdss tiling algorithm @xcite .",
    "we use this mock to test two different aspect of our correlation estimator : the cross - correlation method and the fiber collision weighting scheme .",
    "first we use all the mock galaxies as both our spectroscopic and imaging samples ( no galaxies eliminated by fiber collisions ) .",
    "next we drop the galaxies that would not get a redshift in sdss due to fiber collision from our spectroscopic sample and repeat the test .",
    "figure [ fig : mock ] shows the measured projected correlation function for both cases in comparison to the real projected correlation function for the full cube of the mock .",
    "it is worth noting that on very small scales the shot noise dominates the galaxy pair counts and limits the comparison .",
    "one important issue with all clustering measurements on small scales is possible photometric biases when measuring close pairs .",
    "this may emerge when the outskirts of a pair of galaxies overlap on these scales .",
    "this can lead to biased flux measurements for galaxies which will affect the completeness of the samples .",
    "to estimate the magnitude of this effect for sdss , we ran a simulation in which we create fake images of pairs of galaxies with separations ranging from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "we studied two different cases , one for galaxy pairs consisting of two identical galaxies and another with galaxies of different luminosities .",
    "the basic information regarding these galaxies is summarized in table [ tab : sim ] .",
    "these galaxies represent passively evolving lrg galaxies observed at a redshift of @xmath35 with de vaucouleurs profiles ( @xmath85 s@xmath86rsic profiles ) .",
    "we place one such galaxy pair onto run @xmath87 of sdss imaging .",
    "this run has a typical sdss seeing of about @xmath88 .",
    "each galaxy image is convolved with the local seeing of the field .",
    "the flat fielding vectors and gain corrections applied to the sdss imaging in reverse to each constructed image .",
    "after inserting known bad pixels into the mock galaxy images ; these images are added to raw sdss images .",
    "these new images are then processed using the standard sdss pipeline , photo , to determine the effect of proximity of galaxies on their measured properties .",
    "we found that for the case of two identical galaxies , for separations below @xmath89 , the two galaxies are not well deblended , leading to the detection of a single galaxy with combined flux of the individual galaxies . at separations larger than @xmath90 , the petrosian flux measures @xmath91 percent of the input s@xmath86rsic flux ( as expected ) and the ratio of the recovered to input flux is independent of the separation . in other words , in the absence of a close neighbor for a @xmath85 s@xmath86rsic galaxy , the petrosian flux only measures about @xmath92 percent of a galaxy s light . for intermediate separations , ( @xmath93 )",
    ", the fraction of the recovered flux to input flux increases to @xmath94 percent .",
    "this increase is likely due to a double counting of the low level diffuse emission from the two galaxies which is being poorly deblended between the two objects .",
    "figure [ fig : richard ] shows this result .    using this result we correct for the completeness of our sample on small scales .",
    "we convert angular separation to projected separation using the median redshift of the sample @xmath35 ( the same redshift is used for the test ) .",
    "in addition we know from @xcite that for each @xmath95 magnitude change of the faint limit of our sample the number of galaxies in the samples is increased by roughly 30 percent . for each projected distance separation @xmath37 bin in the projected correlation function",
    "@xmath1 we convert the excess flux count for that separation to an excess of galaxy counts in the sample .",
    "the square of this quantity will be the excess in galaxy pairs allocated to that separation bin .",
    "we then correct our projected correlation function by this factor for each given separation ( figure [ fig : w_rp ] , table [ tab : data ] ) .",
    "the result for the second case with galaxies of different magnitudes is close enough to the first case that we use only the first case to correct our sample .",
    "the projected correlation function @xmath1 can be `` deprojected '' to get @xmath2 by    @xmath96    ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we calculate this integral analytically by linear interpolation between the binned @xmath1 values , following @xcite .",
    "this estimate is only accurate to a few percent , due to limitations of the interpolation .",
    "figure  [ fig : xi ] shows the real - space correlation function , obtained in this fashion , combined with the real - space correlation function @xmath2 on intermediate - scales from @xcite and redshift - space correlation function @xmath97 on large - scales from @xcite for the lrg sample . also shown",

    "figure  [ fig : rsqxi ] shows the real space correlation function divided by a @xmath7 power - law to accentuate the deviations from a power - law .",
    "the dip at @xmath100 is described and quantified by the halo model as the transition from 2-halo to 1-halo term @xcite .",
    "the upturn at @xmath101 could be real but is not highly significant .",
    "finally the drop of the innermost point at @xmath102 is most probably due to deblending issues .",
    "if we interpret the lrg correlation function @xmath2 , measured at small scales as a quasi  steady - state inflow leading to the mergers of pairs of lrgs , we can straightforwardly turn the measured @xmath2 into a merger rate .",
    "we assume that there is a length scale @xmath103 inside of which dynamical friction is so effective that pairs at this separation merge in a dynamical time @xmath104 , where the dynamical time is @xmath105 and @xmath106 is the circular velocity of the orbit , which is roughly @xmath107 times the velocity dispersion @xmath108 ; the exact value of the numerical factor depends on the velocity ellipsoid . for typical velocity dispersions , @xmath109 , and merger length scales,@xmath110 , we find a dynamical time @xmath111 , which is in agreement with time - scales derived by @xcite from merger simulations .",
    "if the number density of lrgs is @xmath112 , the average number @xmath113 within distance @xmath103 of any `` target '' lrg is @xmath114 and the lrg merger rate @xmath115 is , by assumption @xmath116    in this derivation we have used the fact that the @xmath117 ( figure  [ fig : rsqxi ] ) .",
    "this merger rate can be written as @xmath118     \\,\\left[\\frac{\\sigma_v}{200~{{\\mathrm{km}}}\\,{{\\mathrm{s}}}^{-1}}\\right ]     \\,\\left[\\frac{{n_\\mathrm{lrg}}}{10^{-4}~{{\\mathrm{mpc}}}^{-3}}\\right ]     \\quad , \\ ] ] which is equivalent to a comoving volume merger rate of : @xmath119    this merger rate does not depend on the choice of @xmath103 which is indeed poorly known .",
    "it is worth noting that this merger rate is a strict upper limit .",
    "first , we assume that all close pairs will merge , but in principle galaxies in high density clusters could pass by each other without merging .",
    "secondly , we are assuming that all galaxies will merge in a dynamical time , which is the minimum possible time for a merger to occur .",
    "we have combined the data for @xmath3 luminous red galaxies from the sdss spectroscopic sample with lrg targets in the sdss imaging sample to measure the strength of clustering for lrgs on small scales ( @xmath61 to @xmath60 ) .",
    "we deal with the fiber collision incompleteness of the sdss spectroscopic sample on scales smaller than @xmath5 by cross - correlating the spectroscopic and imaging samples and statistically removing the interloping galaxies .",
    "this method is extremely powerful on small scales at which the correlation function becomes much larger than unity .",
    "we find that the correlation function on these scales is very close to an extrapolation of the correlation function power - law found on larger scales @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "this is surprising , as one might expect the direct interactions between galaxies ( e.g. , dynamical friction , galaxy merger , tidal impulses , etc . ) to create features in the correlation function .",
    "this result can not be simply explained with the current best - fit of the of halo occupation distribution ( hod ) models for galaxy clustering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this inconsistency arises from the fact that in current hod models the galaxy - galaxy correlation function on small scales simply follows the convolution of the dark matter halo profile with itself ( 1-halo term ) . for an nfw profile @xcite",
    "this relation is proportional to @xmath121 toward the core of the halo and similarly for the moore profile @xcite produces a @xmath122 relation ; neither is sufficiently steep to fit the results of this paper .",
    "figure  [ fig : xi ] shows the 1-halo term of the correlation function calculated for the hod parameters given in @xcite . if hod models are modified to have a galaxy distribution much more concentrated than the dark matter or to have dark matter halos with density profiles much steeper than nfw toward the core of the halo , this result could in principle be accommodated within hod models .",
    "we convert the correlation function on these scales to statistics of galaxies in close dynamical pairs , and we infer an lrg - lrg merger rate of @xmath123 or a comoving volume merger rate , @xmath124 . the fact that in large clusters , galaxies can closely pass each other without merging , turns any merger rate inferred from close dynamical pair statistics into an strict upper limit .",
    "this upper limit on the lrg merger rate could in principle be violated if the merger process triggers such strong star - formation activities in these galaxies that they become too blue to make it to the lrg sample selection cuts .",
    "however , this proposal is not tenable , as lrgs contain little apparent gas or dust and essentially there are no blue galaxies with luminosities comparable to the lrgs @xcite .",
    "therefore the lrg merger rate is in fact very close to merger rate for all galaxies with lrg luminosities regardless of their color .    in previous work , there are two main methods for measuring merger rates , the most popular one is to convert the close pair statistics to a merger rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other method uses the asymmetry parameter ( @xmath125 ) to determine the fraction of galaxies undergoing mergers @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to compare these previous studies of the merger rate with that found here because our lrg sample is more luminous and has a significantly smaller number density than the samples uses in those studies .",
    "the merger rate has been found to be higher for higher redshifts and higher for fainter samples @xcite .",
    "for this reason , an sdss - size sample was required to measure the merger rate for lrg type galaxies at low redshifts .",
    "nevertheless our result is , in principal , consistent with the extrapolation of the best fits to samples at higher redshifts or fainter samples @xcite .",
    "one question to address by merger - rate measurements is the importance of major mergers in the mass build - up of massive galaxies .",
    "this could be answered by measuring the cross - correlation of galaxies of different mass with lrgs on small scales to obtain a mass spectrum for objects merging into lrgs .",
    "@xcite created a simulation for @xmath126 galaxies to answer this question .",
    "they find that smooth accretion plays the dominant role in mass build - up .",
    "unfortunately the resolution of the simulation ( @xmath127 ) was too close to the galaxies in question to be able to distinguish true smooth accretion from mergers with objects below the mass resolution .",
    "lrgs are massive enough that the merger of objects far below their mass could be studied in hydro - dynamical simulations to give a detailed mass spectrum for merger events .",
