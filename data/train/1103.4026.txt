    "age estimates are required for studying the evolutionary history of star clusters . based on such age estimates ,",
    "a general framework has been developed starting from formation within the dense cores of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) ; a stage where the young stars are completely obscured by their dusty gas cocoons ; an emerging stage where the clusters become visible in the infrared ( ir ) and then visible in the optical as stellar winds and supernovae blow away the gas and dust ; a stage where an expanding bubble of ionized gas is blown ; and later stages with no evidence of ionized gas ( e.g. , see the lada & lada 2003 review article ) .    in the past , two general methods for estimating the ages of unresolved extragalactic star clusters have been used .",
    "the first requires obtaining high quality spectroscopic observations covering wavelength regions of lines which change as a function of time .",
    "examples of this approach include bica & alloin ( 1986 ) , schweizer & seitzer ( 1993 ) , whitmore ( 1999 ) , bastian et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) and wofford et  al .",
    "while these spectroscopic observations typically provide high quality age determinations , they are limited to age - dating relatively small numbers of bright clusters due to constraints on the brightness of clusters that can be observed spectroscopically in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "the standard method for age - dating large numbers of extra - galactic clusters compares photometry in several broadband filters ( e.g. , _ ubvi _ ) with predictions from population synthesis models ( e.g. , chandar et  al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "comparisons of age estimates using spectroscopic and photometric observations of the same clusters show good agreement in most cases .",
    "an early example of this is the famous searle et  al .",
    "( 1980 ) paper where they compare integrated four - filter _ ugvr _ photometry of 61 star clusters in the magellanic clouds with the strength of different spectral features ( e.g. , balmer lines , @xmath14  band , etc . )",
    "a recent example is wofford et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) who compared ages estimated from spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting with those derived from uv spectroscopy for 14 young ( @xmath15  myr ) clusters in the nuclear starburst region of m83 and found that the photometric ages are within a factor of 1.4 of the spectroscopic ones .",
    "whitmore et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) find similar agreement between their photometric age estimates and the spectroscopic estimates from bastian et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) for clusters in the antennae galaxies . while generally satisfactory , both the spectroscopic and photometric techniques have limitations .",
    "it is therefore important to develop independent methods for estimating the ages of clusters , especially for cases where spectroscopic or multi - band photometric observations are not available and it is necessary to estimate ages based on morphological appearance alone .    here ,",
    "we develop two new methods for estimating the ages of young star clusters in nearby galaxies based on high - resolution images at optical wavelengths .",
    "the first method uses the morphology of the ionized gas and its position relative to the cluster stars , as measured from narrowband h@xmath0 emission , to estimate ages ( @xmath16 ) for clusters younger than @xmath17  myr .",
    "this method relies on the general premise that the distribution of h@xmath0 will be largely coincident with the distribution of optical light in the youngest clusters ( i.e. , @xmath10  few myr ) , will be in a small ring - like structure around the optical stellar emission in slightly older clusters where massive star winds and supernovae have had time to blow a bubble ( i.e. , @xmath18 myr ) , and will be in a larger ring - like bubble for still older clusters ( i.e. , 510 myr ) .",
    "many past observational and theoretical studies of hii regions and `` supershells '' in the milky way and nearby galaxies have laid the groundwork for this method .",
    "for example , walborn ( 2002 ; see also walborn & parker 1992 and especially walborn 2010 for related discussions ) outlined an evolutionary cluster sequence based on observed properties of several well known clusters and ob associations in the milky way with ages ranging from @xmath19  myr to @xmath5  myr .",
    "this sequence was then used to illustrate observed changes with age in the visually brightest stars , in the ionized gas and dust content , and in the existence of red supergiants .",
    "much of this sequence was based on spectroscopy of individual stars .",
    "while we are unable to make similarly detailed observations at the distance of m83 , many of the same basic correlations and underlying physical processes are relevant for the age sequence outlined in this paper .",
    "theoretically , several works have made predictions for the size evolution of an expanding hii region over time .",
    "oey & clark ( 1997 , 1998 ) model the size evolution due to mass loss and supernova - injected energy from cluster stars , and assume that expanding bubbles `` stall '' when their internal pressure equals the ambient pressure in the ism .",
    "these simulations predict a strong dependence of bubble size on both the age and mass of the central cluster .",
    "( e.g. , weaver et  al .",
    "1977 , oey & massey 1995 , oey & garcia - segura 2004 , dopita et  al .  2006a , 2006b ) .",
    "our observations of clusters in m83 reveal a strong dependence of bubble size on cluster age , and possibly a weak dependence on cluster mass , as discussed in section  6 .",
    "the second method developed in this paper uses the surface brightness fluctuations of cluster stars to estimate their ages .",
    "young clusters have strong pixel - to - pixel flux variations , due to the presence of massive , luminous stars . as a cluster ages , the bright ,",
    "short - lived massive stars disappear , and these fluctuations fade in strength .",
    "this technique is especially useful in the range @xmath20100  myr , ages that can be somewhat difficult to deal with using the sed method , because the predicted integrated colors loop back on themselves .",

    "it is a slightly barred galaxy , with a hubble type sab(s)c ( 3rc ) . in this work ,",

    "briefly , the observations are part of the early release science project  1 ( ers1 ) program 11360 ( pi : oconnell ) and were taken in august , 2009 .",
    "observations were taken in several broadband ( `` uv '' - f225w , `` u '' - f336w , `` b '' - f438w , `` v '' - f555w , `` i '' - f814w , `` j '' - f110w , and `` h '' - f160w ) , and narrowband filters ( [ oiii ] - f373n , h@xmath23 - f487n , [ oii ] f502n , h@xmath0 - f657n , [ sii ] - f673n , paschen@xmath23 - f128n , and [ feii ] - f164n ) . in the appendix",
    "we briefly investigate clusters in m51 and find that the age versus morphological category relationship derived for m83 is appropriate for this galaxy as well .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we outline our working scheme for an evolutionary cluster classification system based on observables at optical wavelengths . in section  3",
    "we investigate the correlation between h@xmath0 morphology and sed age estimates while section  4 examines the correlation between the strength of surface brightness fluctuations within clusters and their ages .",
    "a catalog of smaller hii regions , apparently ionized by `` single stars , '' is presented in section  5 .",
    "we examine the effect of cluster mass on h@xmath0 bubble size in section  6 , and summarize our primary results in section  7 .",
    "the early formative stages of star cluster evolution are best studied in the ir or microwave part of the spectrum , since the stars remain embedded in their placental dust cocoons for the first million years or so ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "for example , in nearby groups and clusters in the milky way , individual young stellar objects ( ysos ) can be age - dated using a classification scheme ranging from category 0 to iii , as developed by wilking et  al .",

    "in principle , it should be possible to approximately estimate the ages of young ( @xmath17  myr ) star clusters from the size of the ionized gas ( h@xmath0 ) bubble that surrounds them , as outlined in sections  1 and 2 . in this section",
    "we test this idea by selecting a representative catalog of young clusters primarily based on their apprearance in the narrowband h@xmath0 image ( i.e. , the red color in figure  [ fig : large_image ] ) , and then visually classify each source based on the scheme outlined in section  2 .",

    "predictions from single stellar population g.  bruzual & s.  charlot ( 2009 ; private communications , hereafter bc09 ) models are superposed for comparison .",
    "as expected , clusters in the two youngest categories ( 3 and 4a ) have somewhat higher extinction than those in later categories , which results in their colors spreading out along the reddening vector .    the middle set of panels present histograms of ages determined from the photometric dating method used in chandar et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) , for all clusters within a given category .",
    "these age estimates are included in table  1 .",
    "there is a clear trend for clusters in later categories to have older ages . for clusters with associated h@xmath0 emission ,",

    "while our sed dating method includes photometry in the narrowband filter directly in the fit , the photometry is measured in a small ( 3  pixel radius ) aperture that misses most or all of the h@xmath0 emission after category  3 .",
    "hence the age estimates from the sed fitting and from the h@xmath0 morphology are largely independent of one another .",

    "the top panel shows the full range of cluster ages and categories . there is a clear , albeit nonlinear , correlation , with a steeper correlation between morphological category and age for clusters younger than @xmath33  yr .",
    "the nonlinearity is to be expected since h@xmath0 morphology evolves rapidly between the ages of 110 myr .",
    "note that in figure  [ fig : ha_vs_sed ] we have subdivided the morphological types into a finer grid of categories ( based on subjective estimates of the h@xmath0 bubble size ) than outlined in section  2 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : ha_vs_sed ] shows one of the main results of this work , _ that between 2 and 10 myr , the clusters in m83 show a strong correlation between their h@xmath0 morphology and age_. this suggests that the morphology of ionized gas alone can be used as an age indicator .",

    ".    we note that a similar correlation exists between our morphological categories and ages estimated by comparing color magnitude diagrams of individual stars with stellar tracks for stars around some of our objects , as will be discussed in a study of 50 regions in m83 by h.  kim et  al .",
    "( 2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "while the dispersion in the estimated sed ages within each morphological category is remarkably small ( see figure  [ fig:18plot ] and table 2 ) , a close inspection reveals four outliers in category  5b .",
    "three of these clusters ( 44034 , 18032 and 74692 ) have no associated h@xmath0 emission , have relatively small pixel - to - pixel flux variations ( discussed in section 4 ) , and have optical colors consistent with those predicted for extinction - free intermediate age clusters , and therefore almost certainly have ages @xmath40 .",
    "the sed fitting , however , erroneously assigned them lower ages ( @xmath36 ) , and higher extinctions ( i.e. , @xmath41 , 0.36 , 0.50 mag ) .",
    "the fourth cluster ( 10114 ) has significantly bluer colors than the other clusters in category  5b .",
    "in retrospect , this cluster probably belongs in morphological category 4a , since there does appear to be a small amount of h@xmath0 emission associated with it . in this case",
    "it is the morphological classification which appears to be in error rather than the sed age estimate ( the latter is @xmath42 ) .",
    "overall , we find good agreement between the previously determined sed age and currently determined morphological category for 95% of the clusters ( i.e. , 84 out of 88 cases ) , demonstrating that _ both _",
    "techniques are quite reliable .",
    "while the good correlation between the morphological category and sed age found in figure  3 is encouraging , this approach has several limitations .",
    "in particular , placing the clusters into the different categories is subjective and hence not easily automated .",
    "an additional complication is that an isolated , full 360 degree ring with a single dominant central cluster is very rare .",
    "partial rings , multiple loops , and multiple clusters in the region are more typical situations .    here , we attempt to better quantify the relationship between h@xmath0 morphology and cluster age by measuring the radii of the most prominent `` coherent '' ring or partial shell of ionized gas associated with the cluster stars . while the measurement of h@xmath0 bubble size is also difficult to automate , this more quantitative approach provides the opportunity for improving the correlation still further , and for exploring the impact that other physical parameters ( e.g. , cluster mass ) have on this relationship .",
    "figure  [ fig : ha_vs_r ] plots the measured h@xmath0 bubble size versus photometric age for clusters younger than @xmath5  myr ( top panel ) , and bubble size versus morphological category ( bottom panel ) .",
    "there is clearly a strong correlation which suggests that h@xmath0 morphology alone can be used as an age indicator for clusters younger than @xmath5  myr .",
    "this figure hints at other intriguing results as well .",
    "the correlation between age and bubble size is strongest for clusters younger than @xmath43 , with typical bubbles growing from a few pc to @xmath44  pc in size . after this time , between ages @xmath436.9",
    ", there is a large range observed in bubble size , from @xmath44  pc to nearly 80  pc , and no strong dependence on age .",
    "these trends are illustrated by the solid lines , which represent simple linear fits to observations in the two different regimes .",
    "the best linear fits for the top panel are given by : @xmath45 for r @xmath10 20 pc , and @xmath46 for r @xmath12 20 pc .",
    "similar fits are shown in the bottom panel , but numerical values are not included here since the use of morphological category makes them more qualitative .",
    "the large , open circles in the top panel of figure  [ fig : ha_vs_r ] show the clusters with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "these will be discussed further in section 6 .",
    "as discussed in section  2 , bright individual stars are expected to be visible within m83 clusters at ages younger than @xmath49  myr , giving the clusters a mottled appearance with relatively large pixel - to - pixel flux variations .",
    "after this , the flux variations have mostly disappeared , leading to a more uniform appearance among cluster stars .",
    "compare , for example , the images in categories 4b and 5a in the top panel of figure  [ fig:18plot ] , where a number of bright individual cluster stars are clearly visible , with the images for categories 5b and 6 , where individual cluster stars are no longer observed .",
    "figure 2 also shows a variety of cases where older clusters appear as fuzzy objects while single individual stars are clearly observed within the young clusters .    here , we use the strength of these surface brightness fluctuations to develop a new method for estimating the ages of clusters in m83 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the surface brightness fluctuation method used to estimate distances to early - type galaxies ( e.g. , tonry & schneider 1988 ) , but in our case the clusters are all at the same distance and the surface brightness fluctuations are caused by differences in age .",
    "one must exercise caution when using this technique for other galaxies , since the relationships derived below for m83 would need to be renormalized for galaxies at different distances .",
    "we first need to remove the overall radial gradient in the cluster luminosity profile , since this gradient typically dominates over the peak - to - peak variations in pixel flux within the cluster .",
    "we accomplish this by creating a median divided image ( with a @xmath50 smoothing box size ) , which effectively flattens the radial profile of the cluster , leaving behind primarily the smaller scale pixel - to - pixel variations that we are interested in here .",
    "we then measure the rms scatter in the fluxes of pixels located within a 10 pixel radius .",
    "a more sophisticated method is being developed by c.  kaleida et  al .",
    "( 2011 , in preparation ) where the rms variations are measured within the half - light or effective radius r@xmath51 of the cluster , hence accounting for clusters of different sizes in a more systematic manner .",
    "figure  [ fig : sbf ] shows a comparison of the f555w image and the median divided f555w image in a region including clusters younger than @xmath52 ( blue circles and labels ) and older than this ( red circles and labels ) .",
    "the rms measurements are indicated in the bottom panel .",
    "one can easily see that old clusters ( e.g. , nos .",
    "65 and 70 ) nearly disappear from the median divided image , resulting in low values of the rms , while bright , individual stars are observed in the younger clusters ( e.g. , nos .",
    "32 and 49 ) , resulting in a higher rms .",
    "small , barely visible dust lanes also contribute to larger values of rms for the young clusters . in a few very concentrated clusters",
    "there are small artifacts at their centers , for example in cluster no .",
    "64 . however , the rms is dominated by pixels outside of this central region , hence this is a relatively small effect .",
    "we note that for four clusters , identified in table  1 , we have used a slightly smaller radius to avoid single bright stars that are almost certainly unrelated to the cluster ( e.g. , nos .",
    "66 , 69 , 70 and 79 ) .    in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : m83_rms_2plot ]",
    "we plot the rms in the pixel - to - pixel flux measured in the @xmath53 band versus the morphological category .",
    "the resolution is better here for clusters younger than @xmath54  yr ( i.e. , category 3 and 4 objects ) . in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : m83_rms_2plot ]",
    "we plot the rms vs.  the sed age , which gives better resolution for clusters older than @xmath33  yr .",
    "these figures show the second main result of our work , _ that older clusters have smaller rms values of the pixel - to - pixel flux variations .",
    "_ however , we also note , especially in the top panel , that the rms is degenerate , and increases in strength over the age range 27 myr ( i.e. , morphological categories 3 and 4 ) , peaks in category 4 , corresponding to an age of approximately 510  myr , and decreases in strength for clusters with older ages and in later categories .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this behavior .",
    "the first , and probably most important effect , is that the brightest stars ( i.e. , red and blue super giants ) do not appear until about 5 myr , and are largely gone by about 20 myr .",
    "two other evolutionary effects may potentially contribute to the low rms measured for the very young clusters .",
    "( 1 )  the central part of the cluster , where it is difficult to detect individual stars due to the high background , might emerge from its dust cocoon before the outskirts .",
    "( 2 )  clusters may start out very compact and expand with age . hence crowding",
    "may make it impossible to detect individual stars at very early ages .",
    "there is both theoretical and observational support for both of these conjectures , as discussed below .",
    "these trends are illustrated by the lines in figure  [ fig : m83_rms_2plot ] , which represent linear fits to observations .",
    "the best fits for the top panel are given by : @xmath55 ( i.e. , a 5 @xmath35 correlation ) for category @xmath104.7 , and @xmath56 ( i.e. , a 6 @xmath35 correlation ) for category @xmath574.7 .",
    "for the bottom panel , only the trend for older clusters is shown , with @xmath58 for @xmath39 .",
    "we will better quantify the correlation between cluster age and the rms in pixel - to - pixel fluxes in a future paper using a significantly larger number of clusters .",
    "we note that these relationships will be different for galaxies at different distances , and in different filters .",
    "for example , fluctuations will generally be larger for older clusters ( 1001000  myr ) in the near - ir due to the presence of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "values of rms pixel - to - pixel flux variations for each cluster are included in table 1 , and the mean values for clusters in each morphological category are included in table 2 .",
    "the rms method is particularly promising for estimating the ages of clusters between 10 and 100 myr , a range which can be somewhat difficult for the sed method because the integrated colors of clusters loop back on themselves during this period .",
    "clusters in this age range can be identified initially by their lack of ionized gas .",
    "it is instructive to look at the outliers in figure  [ fig : m83_rms_2plot ] , just as we did for the correlation between sed age and morphological category in section  3.1 . in the bottom panel",
    "the cluster with rms  = 0.03 and @xmath59 ( i d  = 44034 ) is an apparent outlier .",
    "it is also one of the sources which we believe , based on the discussion in section  3.1 , has an incorrect sed age estimate .",
    "based on its measured colors and assuming @xmath60 instead of 0.28 , this cluster has a likely age of @xmath61 , more appropriate for it s low rms value .",
    "similarly , many of the data points just to the right of this one are the same category 5b outliers discussed in section  3.1 that have suspect ages .",
    "other data points in the same region of the @xmath29 versus rms plot are located in the large bubble just below the nucleus of m83 , where it is difficult to measure the rms accurately due to the very high background .",
    "we note that the four clusters with rms  @xmath62 and @xmath63 are all in morphological category 3 , and are largely responsible for the decline in the measured rms for the youngest clusters .",
    "many of the trends discussed above are seen in table 2 , which lists the mean values of several parameters as a function of morphological category . in particular , the trends in @xmath64 , @xmath29 , and h@xmath0 shell radius ( when present ) are clearly evident .",
    "in addition , the double - valued nature of pixel - to - pixel rms values is evident , with a peak at category 4a .",
    "one correlation that was mentioned briefly is the trend of increasing cluster size with age , quantified by the increase in the concentration index ( ci ) from values around 2.5 for categories 3 and 4a to @xmath65 for categories 5b and 6 .",
    "we find the same trend in our m51 data , which is briefly discussed in the appendix .",
    "this effect appears to be real , and is likely related to the rapid expansion of the clusters ( see , for example , mackey & gilmore 2003 ; bastian et  al .",
    "2009 ; pfalzner 2009 ) .",
    "several different physical mechanisms may be responsible for this expansion , including the expulsion of leftover ism due to feedback from massive stars ( e.g. , goodwin & bastian 2006 ; baumgardt & kroupa 2007 ) , and heating by binary stars and stellar mass black holes ( e.g. , mackey et  al .",
    "2008 ; see portegies zwart et  al .",

    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "while the dominant sources of ionizing flux responsible for the h@xmath0 emission in m83 are massive , young star clusters , which were studied in the previous sections , there is also a population of compact hii regions which are ionized by what appear to be single stars . in this section",
    "we identify and study a sample of 22 hii regions with very small h@xmath0 radii and an unresolved central point source ( based on their ci , i.e. , the magnitude difference between 0.5 and 3 pixel radii ; see chandar et  al .",

    "only the brighter candidates have been retained for this first exploratory study ; the sample could be increased by a factor of two or more if fainter , less distinct objects were included .",
    "the measured colors of these sources , shown in figure  [ fig : mini_cmd ] , either coincide with the colors predicted for the bluest ( youngest ) stars in the upper left portion of the diagram , or are found downstream along the reddening vector .",
    "basic properties of these sources , including positions , @xmath26 , ci , colors and measured radii of the h@xmath0 bubble , are compiled in table  3 .",
    "we note that it is unlikely that all of these objects are actually individual massive stars , hence the use of quotes around `` single star . ''",
    "some , or even most of these may be a dominant star among a close grouping of stars which are either too close to the primary source , or too faint , to be detected .",
    "what we can say is that a single ( or very close binary ) star dominates the light profile , resulting in a ci that is indistinguishable from a single star .",
    "if we assume that all of these objects have a similar age , and that the distribution in the two - color diagram is primarily due to reddening , we can correct for the effects of reddening and extinction .",
    "we show the corrected photometry in a color magnitude diagram in the left panel of figure  [ fig : mini_cmd ] . here",
    ", we have assumed an intrinsic color of @xmath66 , the color of the bluest object , and solve for the @xmath27 color excess of each hii region .",
    "we find that this procedure moves most of the objects to a very young isochrone ( 4 myr is shown ) , although three sources scatter to the left of the models . these may be especially young stars , or the offset may result from observational uncertainties , since these are the three most reddened sources , and hence have the largest corrections .    while many of these single - star hii ( i.e. , sshii ) regions are found near large regions of recent star formation , several of them are quite isolated ( see figure 3 from whitmore 2010 ) , raising the possibility that these massive stars formed in the field rather than in clusters or associations .",
    "for example , five of the 22 sshii regions are @xmath671 kpc away from any region of active star formation .",
    "if these are stars that have been dynamically ejected from their birthsites , i.e. , runaways , they must have velocities @xmath67200 km / s .",
    "however , they do not appear to have the prominent bow - front morphologies typical of many runaway stars in the galaxy and magellanic clouds ( e.g. , gvaramadze et  al .",
    "velocity measurements are needed to establish if these massive stars formed in the field or are runaways from larger star - forming regions .",
    "as summarized in the introduction , the spatial relationship between young @xmath68  yr star clusters and their hii regions has been previously studied both observationally and theoretically . to our knowledge however , no study has yet systematically measured the sizes of h@xmath0 bubbles in a nearby galaxy and correlated these sizes with the properties of their ionizing star clusters , as we have done here .",
    "we have demonstrated that in m83 there is a good correlation between bubble size and age for clusters younger than @xmath43 , and that clusters with ages @xmath436.9 have a larger range in bubble size .",
    "this suggests that some of the expanding bubbles at these older ages may have effectively `` stalled . ''",
    "theoretical work suggests that bubble size should depend not only on the ambient pressure in the ism and the age of the cluster , but also on cluster mass . to look for evidence of a mass - dependence on bubble size",
    ", we compare the sizes measured for h@xmath0 bubbles associated with @xmath696.9 clusters that are more and less massive than @xmath70 . at these ages",
    "the bubbles are presumably approaching their stall radius , and the effect of cluster mass should be more apparent .",
    "the large , open circles in the top panel of figure  [ fig : ha_vs_r ] show the sizes of clusters with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "while clusters at high and low masses have an overlapping range in cluster size , there is a tendency for more massive clusters to have larger bubbles , with median sizes of 18  pc and 41  pc for @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "a formal fit of h@xmath0 radius versus @xmath73 for these clusters gives a slope of @xmath74 , suggesting that there may be a weak correlation between bubble size and mass .",
    "future studies that include a larger number of sources , selected in a more systematic way , are needed to confirm this result .",
    "however , other effects may also be important .",
    "for example , stochasticity in the number of massive stars formed in lower mass clusters can strongly affect their integrtated colors and hence their estimated ages . in this case , a lower mass cluster can have an intrinsically redder color than a higher mass cluster of the same age ( e.g. , fouesneau & lancon 2010 ) , and hence an older estimate for the age of the cluster .",
    "in addition to the correlation between h@xmath0 bubble size and cluster age ( and possibly mass ) , we also found that the rms variations in pixel - to - pixel brightness correlates with cluster age .",
    "this result has applications beyond star clusters , and can be used to constrain the ages of stellar populations in general .",
    "for example , portions of m83 itself that contain young stars and star clusters , such as along the spiral arms , have larger pixel - to - pixel flux variations than portions of m83 dominated by older stars , such as between the arms ( see h.  kim et  al .",
    "2011 , in preparation for a discussion ) .",
    "this is also true in large portions of m82 and in portions of the tidal tails of galaxy mergers , where regions dominated by intermediate age star clusters ( @xmath67100  myr ) have small fluctuations in the surface brightness of the field stars .",
    "we have used observations taken with the newly installed wfc3 camera on - board the _ hubble space telescope _ to develop two independent methods for age - dating young star clusters in the nearby spiral galaxy m83 .",
    "our primary results are summarized below .",
    "a working classification system , largely based on h@xmath0 morphology and pixel - to - pixel flux variations , was developed to map an observed age sequence onto a proposed sequence of cluster evolution .",
    "the underlying evolutionary picture includes the formation of dense cores in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) ; a stage where the young stars are completely obscured by their dust cocoon ; an emerging stage where the clusters become visible in the ir , and then in the optical as stellar winds and supernovae blow away the dust ; a stage where an expanding h@xmath0 bubble is blown and the existence of very bright young stars leads to large pixel - to - pixel flux variations ; and later stages with no evidence of h@xmath0 and diminishing pixel - to - pixel flux variations .    \\2 .",
    "we found that h@xmath0 morphology , i.e. , the size of the ionized gas bubble , provides a viable method for age - dating clusters in the range 110  myr .",
    "this method is based on the simple premise that the gas in very young ( @xmath2  few myr ) clusters is largely coincident with the cluster stars , is in a small , ring - like structure surrounding the stars in slightly older clusters since the winds from massive stars have had time to push out the natal gas ( e.g. , @xmath75  myr ) , and is in a larger ring - like bubble for still older clusters ( i.e. , @xmath67510  myr ) .",
    "if no h@xmath0 is associated with a cluster it is generally older than @xmath6710  myr .",
    "we first made _ qualitative _ estimates based on the classification scheme outlined above , and find that the ages of the clusters , as determined from the sed method described in chandar et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) , correlate well with the morphological categories , with a scatter of @xmath670.1 in @xmath29 within each category for the clusters with h@xmath0 emission , and a scatter of @xmath670.5 in @xmath29 for the older clusters .",
    "we then _ quantified _ this technique by correlating the measured radii of the most conspicuous h@xmath0-emitting ring or shell which appears to be physically related to the cluster with the sed ages determined in chandar et  al .",
    "we found tentative evidence for a weak correlation between bubble size and cluster mass , but a larger , more objectively selected sample will be required to confirm this .",
    "we then used pixel - to - pixel flux variations to age - date clusters .",
    "this technique is based on the fact that individual stars are bright enough to be visible within clusters when they are young ( e.g. , m@xmath6 , the approximate detection level , for the brightest stars with ages @xmath10100 myr ) , leading to relatively large pixel - to - pixel variations in flux . the strength of the fluctuations peaks in clusters with ages of @xmath67510  myr , presumably because this is when the brightest stars ( e.g. , red and blue super giants ) appear .",
    "the number of luminous , evolved stars falls off for both younger and older clusters .",
    "this degeneracy in age can be broken using other age indicators such as the h@xmath0 morphology .",
    "the technique is especially useful for identifying clusters older than 100 myr .",
    "a by - product of this study was the identification of 22 `` single - star '' hii regions in m83 . by assuming that all of these objects have a similar age , and that the distribution in the two - color diagram is primarily due to reddening , we corrected for the effects of reddening and extinction .",
    "we found that this procedure moves most of the objects to a very young isochrone with an age approximately 4  myr .",
    "some of these massive stars are located far from any star - forming region , indicating that they either formed in the field or were dynamically ejected from their birthsites at very high velocities .",
    "these sshii regioins will be studied in more detail in h.  kim et  al .",
    "( 2011 , in preparation ) .    in the future , we will extend the classification system into the near - ir ( i.e. , categories  1 and 2 ) using our j and h observations .",
    "we will also calculate the energy budget of cluster stars and compare with physical properties of the clusters and the ism .",
    "finally , we will extend this analysis to other galaxies in the ers1 sample ( including `` low pressure '' systems such as the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc  4214 ) in order to determine whether the relationships are universal or are strongly dependent on environment .",

    "<S> we use new wfc3 observations of the nearby grand design spiral galaxy m83 to develop two independent methods for estimating the ages of young star clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the first method uses the physical extent and morphology of h@xmath0 emission to estimate the ages of clusters younger than @xmath1  myr . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the simple premise that the gas in very young ( @xmath2  few myr ) clusters is largely coincident with the cluster stars , is in a small , ring - like structure surrounding the stars in slightly older clusters since massive star winds and supernovae have had time to push out the natal gas ( e.g. , @xmath3  myr ) , and is in a larger ring - like bubble for still older clusters ( i.e. , @xmath410 myr ) . if no h@xmath0 is associated with a cluster it is older than @xmath5 myr . </S>",
    "<S> the second method is based on an observed relation between pixel - to - pixel flux variations within clusters and their ages . </S>",
    "<S> this method relies on the fact that the brightest individual stars in a cluster are most prominent at ages around 10 myr , and fall below the detection limit ( i.e. , m@xmath6 ) for ages older than about 100 myr . </S>",
    "<S> older clusters therefore have a smoother appearance and smaller pixel - to - pixel variations . </S>",
    "<S> the youngest clusters also have lower flux variations , hence the relationship is double valued . </S>",
    "<S> this degeneracy in age can be broken using other age indicators such as h@xmath0 morphology . </S>",
    "<S> these two methods are the basis for a new morphological classification system which can be used to estimate the ages of star clusters based on their appearance . </S>",
    "<S> we compare previous age estimates of clusters in m83 determined from fitting _ _ ubvi__h@xmath0 measurements using predictions from stellar evolutionary models with our new morphological categories and find good agreement at the @xmath7% level . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter within categories is @xmath8  dex in @xmath9 for young clusters ( @xmath1010 myr ) and @xmath11  dex for older ( @xmath1210 myr ) clusters . </S>",
    "<S> a by - product of this study is the identification of 22 `` single - star '' hii regions in m83 , with central stars having ages @xmath13 myr . </S>"
