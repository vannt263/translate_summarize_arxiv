    "iv , and finally the conclusion of this study will be presented in sec . v.",
    "the model that is analyzed in this study consists of two quantum dots which are placed into a single - mode cavity .",
    "the quantum dots have large sizes satisfying the condition @xmath4 .",
    "we also assume that there are a few electrons excited from valence - band to conduction - band .",
    "then the excitation density of the coulomb - correlated electron - hole pairs , excitons , in the ground state for each quantum dot is low .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the average number of excitons is no more than one for an effective area of the excitonic bohr radius .",
    "therefore exciton operators can be approximated with boson operators , and all nonlinear terms including exciton - exciton interactions and the phase space filling effect can be neglected .",
    "the ground energy of the excitons in each dots is assumed to be the same .",
    "there is a resonant interaction between the single - mode cavity field and the excitons .",
    "the distance between two quantum dots is assumed to be much larger than the optical wavelength @xmath5 of the cavity field , so the interaction between quantum dots can be neglected . under the rotating wave approximation",
    ", the hamiltonian for this system can be written as  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the operators of the cavity field with frequency @xmath8 , @xmath9 denote the exciton operators with the same frequency @xmath8 of the cavity field , and @xmath10 represent the first dot or the second dot .",

    "it is very clear that three subsystems become entangled with the time evolution except at some critical times @xmath40 for integer @xmath41 .",
    "but what we are interested in is the entanglement between two subsystems of excitons , so we trace over mode of the cavity field in the density matrix of the system given as @xmath42 to obtain the reduced density matrix @xmath43 of excitons for any arbitrary time @xmath36 .",

    "it is evident that unitary evolution of the wave function can not change its purity , however tracing out the cavity field reduces the other subsystems into a statistical mixture .",

    "we can choose two different coherent states , which are nonorthogonal and form a super - complete set , as a basis to span a two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "but it is not suitable to define qubits using two - dimensional super - complete set of basis .",

    "it has been shown that such mesoscopic coherent superpositions can be generated by experimentalists using cavity qed  @xcite or a trapped ion  @xcite .",
    "for the cavity field initially prepared in the odd coherent state , eq.([eq : op ] ) can be written as @xmath73 with normalization constant @xmath74 . under the above conditions ,",
    "we can write @xmath75 and @xmath76 . then the reduced density operator ( [ eq : ee ] ) can be rewritten in the matrix representation as follows    @xmath77    2 in the standard basis @xmath78 denotes state @xmath79 .",
    "we can obtain the square roots of eigenvalues of the matrix ( [ eq : m ] ) corresponding to the matrix ( [ eq : r ] ) as    @xmath80    then the concurrence @xmath81 of the prepared state with an initial odd coherent state of the cavity field is found as @xmath82    we can also obtain the average photon number @xmath83 of the cavity field as follows @xmath84 eqs.([eq : ww]-[eq:20 ] ) show that two subsystems of the excitons becomes maximally entangled for any time satisfying the condition @xmath85 for any intensity @xmath86 of the coherent cavity field , and in this moment no photon of the cavity field can be detected .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the time evolution of ( [ eq : ww ] ) for two different intensity values @xmath86 of the cavity field .",
    "it is clearly seen that maximally entangled coherent states of excitons can be prepared by the cavity field of odd coherent states .",
    "the entanglement periodically reaches its maximum .",
    "it is also found that when the excitonic states are in a maximally entangled state , the average photon number of the cavity field is zero ( see fig.[fig3a ] ) .",
    "this enables us to monitor the status of the system during preparation of the entangled excitonic coherent states by detecting the photon number of the cavity field .",
    "if the cavity field is initially prepared in an even coherent state @xmath87 where the normalization constant is @xmath88 , using the same procedure the concurrence @xmath89 is found as @xmath90 and the average number @xmath83 of the cavity field is @xmath91 ) , it is found that we can not obtain maximally entangled states when the cavity field is initially in the even coherent state .",
    "but the analytical expression ( [ eq : ce ] ) shows that when the coherent intensity @xmath92 of the cavity field tends to infinity , we can approximately obtain maximally entangled excitonic coherent state at    = 4.5 cm = 4.25 cm    time @xmath85 .",
    "in fact numerical results show that when the coherent intensity @xmath93 , the concurrence approximately reaches its maximum at the same time @xmath85 .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows the time evolution of the concurrence @xmath89 for two different @xmath92 values of the cavity field .",
    "it is concluded that a quasi - maximally entangled excitonic coherent states can be prepared using the initial even coherent state of the cavity field when the coherent intensity @xmath92 becomes intensive .    in fig.[fig3a ] , a comparison of the degree of entanglement and its relation with the average number of photons ( @xmath83 ) in the cavity for cavity fields initially prepared in odd and even coherent states is presented .",
    "it is seen that ( i ) both the concurrence and @xmath83 shows a periodic evolution , ( ii)concurrence reaches to its maximum value when @xmath94 for both cases , and ( iii ) for the cavity field initially prepared in odd coherent state , it is possible to obtain maximally entangled states for some evolution times , but this is not true for cavity field initially prepared in even coherent state .",
    "in this section , we will focus our attention on how the environment with zero temperature affects the entanglement of the excitons .",
    "we assume that the energy of the system is dissipated only by the interaction of the excitons in the quantum dots with the multi - modes of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "our discussion is limited to these two completely equivalent quantum dots , that is , they have the same coupling constants with the cavity field , and also have the same dissipative dynamics . under above considerations , we have the following hamiltonian with the rotating - wave approximation as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is determined by ( [ eq : h0 ] ) , and @xmath97 denote the multi - modes electromagnetic field operators with the frequencies @xmath98 , and @xmath10 means the quantum dot one ( two ) . using the assumption @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , we can write the equations of motion for all operators as follows    @xmath101    we know that only the solution of the cavity field operator is enough to solve our problem .",
    "we apply the laplace transformation and the wigner - weisskopf approximation  @xcite to the above set of eqs.([eq : q1]-[eq : qq ] ) .",
    "so the time - dependent solution of the cavity field operator with the zero - temperature environment can be obtained as @xmath102 where    @xmath103e^{-i\\omega t}}{i2\\delta } \\label{eq : sh1}\\\\ v_{1}^{\\prime}(t)&=&v_{2}^{\\prime}(t)= \\frac{2\\kappa[e^{\\frac{1}{4}(-\\gamma+i\\delta)t}- e^{\\frac{1}{4}(-\\gamma - i\\delta)t } ] e^{-i\\omega t}}{i\\delta } \\label{eq : sh2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath104 , and @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a distribution function of the multimode electromagnetic radiation field .",
    "a small lamb frequency shift has been neglected in above eqs.([eq : sh1]-[eq : sh2 ] ) .",
    "we take the same steps as in the sect .",
    "ii , and obtain the time - dependent wave function of the whole system with cavity field initially in the odd mesoscopic coherent superposition of states ( [ eq : odd ] ) and other subsystems in the vacuum states @xmath107 after tracing over the environment and the cavity field , we obtain the reduced density matrix of two subsystems of the excitons as @xmath108 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & |c|^2(|\\alpha_{1}v^{\\prime}_{1}\\rangle \\langle\\alpha_{1}v^{\\prime}_{1}|)_{1 } \\otimes(|\\alpha_{1}v^{\\prime}_{2}\\rangle \\langle\\alpha_{1}v^{\\prime}_{2}|)_{2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & |c|^2(|\\alpha_{2}v^{\\prime}_{1}\\rangle \\langle\\alpha_{2}v^{\\prime}_{1}|)_{1 } \\otimes(|\\alpha_{2}v^{\\prime}_{2}\\rangle \\langle\\alpha_{2}v^{\\prime}_{2}|)_{2 } \\label{eq : mm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath109 , where the condition @xmath110 , which comes from the commutation relation @xmath111=1 $ ] , is used",
    ". then we choose the basis as the section ii , and use the same step to obtain the concurrence corresponding to the reduced density matrix operator ( [ eq : mm ] ) @xmath112 where @xmath113 is determined by ( [ eq : sh2 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath114 which means that the whole system has no any dissipation of energy , then we find that ( [ eq : ww2 ] ) returns to ideal case ( [ eq : ww ] ) .",
    "figs . 4 and 5",
    "show that the entanglement of the two coherent excitonic states is gradually reduced by the environment with time evolution . if the decay rate @xmath115 of the excitons is fixed , then the higher the intensity of the cavity field is , the faster the decay of entanglement is . in the same way ,",
    "if the intensity of the cavity field is fixed , then for a system with larger decay rate @xmath115 of excitons , the amount of entanglement reduces faster .",
    "= 5.5 cm    = 5.5 cm",
    "the entanglement of formation for coherent states of the excitons in the system of two coupled quantum dots by cavity field is investigated .",
    "we find that a maximally entangled coherent state of two - modes excitons can be prepared by an odd coherent state of the cavity field .",
    "the status of this entangled excitonic coherent state can be probed by the measurement of the cavity field .",
    "no photon detection in the cavity implies the preparation of maximally entangled excitonic coherent states . in the case of photon detection of any number",
    ", it can be said that the excitons are not maximally entangled .",
    "the effects of the zero - temperature environment on the entanglement of excitons is also studied by using concurrence .",
    "it is found that the amount of entanglement between two excitonic coherent states is reduced by the environment with time evolution due to the loss of photons of the cavity field to the environment .",
    "if leakage from the cavity to the environment is monitored by photon counting detectors , an absence of photo - detections implies that maximally entangled state of the excitons can be found in the coupled quantum dot system with time evolution . in case of any photon detection , we are certain that the system can not reach to a maximally entangled state . if the decay rate @xmath115 of the excitons is given , for the system with higher cavity field intensity , the decrease in the amount of entanglement is faster .",
    "it is also understood that if the coherent intensity of the cavity field is given , then the large decay rate @xmath115 of excitons corresponds to a fast reduction in entanglement of the system .",
    "to have an idea on the characteristic time - scales of the dynamics of entanglement in our model , we can take @xmath116 which may be possible to obtain in a system of large area quantum dot with cavity @xcite . in that case , for an ideal cavity with initial field prepared as an odd coherent state , the first maximally entangled state could be observed after a time evolution of @xmath117 and this would repeat itself periodically with a period of @xmath118 . for a practical cavity ,",
    "the finite cavity lifetime may be taken as @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "for these @xmath120 and @xmath115 values , we can find @xmath121 . with @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) ,",
    "the maximum value for concurrence would be @xmath124 ( @xmath125)which occurs at @xmath126 . after a time evolution of @xmath118 , the second peak for the concurrence would appear with a value of @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that for a practical scheme the main parameters which would affect the dynamics of the system are the fast rate of the photon loss from the cavity and intensity of the initial cavity field .",
