    "according to relativistic kinematics a photon velocity in vacuum @xmath0 does not depend on its energy @xmath1 , while a possible dependency is constrained by the current photon mass limit as where @xmath2 is a massless particle vacuum speed .",
    "however , the laboratory or stellar vacuum always contains background fields ( matter ) and quantum interactions can slow down or speed up photon propagation .",
    "tiny changes of the photon velocity have been predicted  @xcite,@xcite for such non - trivial , polarized vacua modified by electromagnetic or gravitational fields , temperature or boundary conditions within the perturbative quantum electrodynamics which allows to derive inverse relative velocities ( vacuum refraction indices @xmath3 ) mainly for low energy @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the electron mass ) photons  @xcite . even in the absence of background fields",
    "vacuum quantum fluctuations can influence light propagation as pointed out for the gravitational vacuum by recent developments in quantum gravity theory  @xcite .",
    "changes of photon speed are expected to be significant at photon energies close to the planck mass @xmath6 decreasing with lower energies .",
    "hypothetical lorentz symmetry deformations considered for explaining the observed ultrahigh energy cosmic rays above the gzk cutoff ( and possibly neutrino oscillations )  @xcite may also introduce an energy dependent photon speed  @xcite .",
    "magnitudes of these predicted effects are small and though may exceed by many orders the constraints imposed by the photon mass , all experimental tests so far show that different energy photons in vacuum move at the same velocity ( light vacuum speed @xmath2 ) within the constraints displayed on fig.1 ( use of vacuum refraction index @xmath7 instead of photon velocity is convenient to distinguish between photon mass and vacuum properties ) .",
    "the most stringent limits are coming from the detection of highest energy proton and @xmath8 cosmic particles as first noted in  @xcite , since in a dispersive vacuum they would quickly decay by vacuum cherenkov radiation and pair creation .",
    "these processes are kinematically forbidden in case @xmath9 for cherenkov radiation and pair creation respectively with @xmath10 the proton mass and energy .",
    "excluded areas in fig.1 correspond to a highest detected proton energy of @xmath11  @xcite and to a cosmic photon spectrum up to @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "also shown is a limit inferred from the highest observed electron energy of @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "other areas are excluded by experiments utilizing direct time of flight techniques sensitive to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a time difference between arrivals of simultaneously emitted photons with different energy and @xmath16 is a distance to the source . while laboratory experiments are limited by time resolutions of typically a few @xmath17 and distances of a few @xmath18 ( an early slac result  @xcite @xmath19 is shown on fig.1 by a narrow white bar at the astrophysical observations could do much better owing to huge distances to the source . in ref .",
    "@xcite one can find limits on light speed variations in wide energy ranges based on different astrophysical events ; these limits suffer , however , from very uncertain distance scales .",
    "meanwhile an observed spectacular gamma ray burst grb990123  @xcite followed by an optical counterpart detected within , with a distance , could establish a constraint for which is anyhow the order of constraints quoted in ref .",
    "photons with highest observed energies from a well defined active galaxy source ( markarian 421 ) put constraints @xmath20 @xcite ( hatched area in fig.1 ) .",
    "apart from the discussed threshold effects for vacuum cherenkov and pair creation , the dispersive vacuum will modify the kinematics of other processes involving free photons according to the dispersion relation however , the tiny refraction imposed by such vacuum becomes observable only at high energies with corresponding small angles .",
    "when the photon ( four - momentum @xmath21 ) interacts with a particle ( four - momentum @xmath22 ) the vacuum index will contribute to the convolution @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath251 are energy , lorentz - factor of the particle , and @xmath26 is the angle between the photon and the particle .",
    "thus , such processes in general could detect a relative photon speed variation , at given energy @xmath1 , as small as the order of @xmath27 .",
    "below we concentrate on photon scattering off an ultrarelativistic electron and apply ( [ eqpk ] ) in energy - momentum conservation to get sensitivity of the high energy compton process to the vacuum refraction index .",
    "if @xmath28 designate energy and angle of the incident and scattered photons , for @xmath29 we have @xmath30 \\label{eqnm1}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are the lorentz - factor and energy of the initial electron , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the index for the direction @xmath34 and energy @xmath1 . in a case of laser compton scattering on accelerator electrons",
    "the initial states ( @xmath35 ) are known to high degree of precision ( typically to @xmath36 ) which allows to gain information about @xmath33 from each event measuring the @xmath1 and @xmath34 ( or the energy and angle of the scattered electron @xmath37 , since ) .",
    "alternatively one could detect only the compton edge i.e. maximal(minimal ) energy of the scattered photons(electrons ) at to measure @xmath38 down to values of @xmath39 which follows from ( [ eqnm1 ] ) if @xmath40 is measured with relative uncertainty @xmath41 .",
    "a dotted line in fig.1 shows the potential of laboratory compton scattering in limiting @xmath33 according to ( [ eqnmm ] ) for optical lasers ( @xmath42 ) with a modest precision @xmath43 up to a photon energy of @xmath44 .",
    "the laser scattering is particularly attractive to test vacuum birefringence since the highest energy scattered photons preserve the laser polarization  @xcite which is easy to change . flipping the laser linear polarization one could measure @xmath45 , @xmath46 components for multi - gev photons by detecting the compton edge dependence on @xmath47 ,",
    "@xmath48 polarization states ( current bounds on the vacuum birefringence  @xcite are set by polarimetry of ( near)optical photons coming from distant astronomical sources ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been proposed to test different quantities related to photon velocity by high energy compton process measuring simultaneously the scattered photon and electron energies .",
    "however , this set of measurements is not sensitive to the photon speed which is accessible only from the photon energy and momentum combined information . to measure the photon momentum one has to register scattering angle of the photon or electron relying for the latter case on energy - momentum conservation",
    "it is possible to indirectly register zero scattering angle of the photon by detecting the compton edge as it pointed out above and only then an energy measurement alone is sufficient to obtain information about the photon speed .",
    "another distinguished kinematic point in the compton process , where circularly polarized photons interact with longitudinally polarized electrons , is the energy asymmetry ( between spin 1/2 and 3/2 states ) zero crossing which occurs at the maximal scattering angle of the electron and therefore at a fixed photon momentum .",
    "thus , the corresponding energy @xmath49 of the scattered photon gives a measure of the photon speed @xmath50   \\label{eqnm11}\\ ] ] this is a reduced form of eqn.([eqnm1 ] ) where angle detection is replaced by an energy measurement at the expense of dealing with polarized beams and is useful because most of the laboratory compton devices are working as polarimeters .",
    "derived relations allow to extract the refraction index and associated photon speed from existing polarimetric data .",
    "consider photon spectra ( fig.2 ) from ref .",
    "@xcite measured by the hera compton polarimeter .",
    "the spectra were obtained by directing a cw @xmath51 laser light against the hera transversely polarized , @xmath52 electron beam with a vertical crossing angle of @xmath53 and detecting produced high energy @xmath8-quanta with a sampling calorimeter .",
    "the whole detection scheme is designed for measurement of an up - down spatial asymmetry of the @xmath8-quanta which is introduced by a flip of the laser light helicity and is proportional to the electron beam polarization while the energy measurement is auxiliary and serves as a mean to enhance the asymmetry by proper energy cuts .",
    "we are going to extract compton @xmath8 s maximal energy from the spectra and estimate the refraction index via eqn.([eqnm1 ] ) at .",
    "hence , following  @xcite and  @xcite , we concentrate on details of the experimental setup important for energy measurement only , ignoring all features related to polarization .    the scattered compton photons originate from an interaction region ( ir ) about @xmath54 long , defined by the crossing angle and size of the electron and laser beams . bending magnets downstream of the ir",
    "separate the electron and @xmath8 beams and the photons leave the vacuum pipe through a @xmath55 thick aluminum window to pass @xmath56 of air before entering the calorimeter which is installed @xmath57 away from the ir .",
    "collimators placed at a distance of @xmath58 from the ir , define an aperture of @xmath59 the same as angular size of the calorimeter as seen from the ir .",
    "the aperture is 15 times larger than the largest ( horizontal ) angular spread of electrons at the ir and 40 times larger than the characteristic radiation angle @xmath60 so the acceptance inefficiency can be ignored .",
    "the collimators are followed by magnets to sweep out charged background .",
    "the calorimeter consists of 12 layers of @xmath61 thick tungsten and @xmath62 thick scintillator plates surrounded by 4 wavelength shifters attached to 4 photomultipliers .",
    "pmt signals from single photons are integrated within @xmath63 gate then digitized with 12 bit adcs and gains of the pmts are adjusted to about @xmath64 per adc channel .",
    "a fast daq handles the signals and operates without dead time up to an average data rate of @xmath65 .",
    "the detector performance has been simulated with egs4 monte - carlo program and tested using desy and cern test beams .",
    "measured energy resolution of @xmath66 , spatial non - uniformity of @xmath67 and nonlinearity of @xmath68 at @xmath69 are reported to be in agreement with the simulations .",
    "apart from the laser light , the electron beam also interacts with residual gas , thermal photons and bending magnetic field in the beam pipe producing respectively bremsstrahlung , scattered blackbody and synchrotron radiation reaching the calorimeter . to measure this background",
    "the laser beam is blocked for @xmath70 of each @xmath71 measurement cycle ( light on / off is 40/20  sec ) .",
    "the procedure allows to eliminate the background by a simple subtraction of time normalized light - off spectrum from the light - on spectrum .",
    "exact on / off durations are counted by daq clocks .    at the time of the measurements",
    "an electron beam current of @xmath72 and a laser power of @xmath73 provide @xmath74 rate above an energy threshold of @xmath75 while the background rate was @xmath76 . with such high threshold",
    "only the bremsstrahlung contributes to background since the scattered blackbody radiation maximal energy is @xmath77 and the synchrotron radiation is absorbed in the first tungsten plate of the calorimeter .    putting the laser photon , hera electron energy and the crossing angle ( @xmath78 ) into the definition of the kinematic parameter @xmath79",
    ", we get @xmath80 .",
    "the precision of the parameter is limited by the electron beam energy uncertainty @xmath81 .",
    "errors of the other constituents @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 @xmath85 contribute negligibly .    to measure",
    "the ratio @xmath86 ( the only unknown in the right part of ( [ eqnm1 ] ) at we can utilize the bremsstrahlung spectrum ( @xcite , fig.18 ) which helps to cancel the absolute energy calibration of the calorimeter since @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a calibration constant and @xmath89 , @xmath90 are the bremsstrahlung and compton edges derived from the measured spectra in arbitrary units .",
    "it is easy to verify that influence of the term ( [ eqpk ] ) to the bremsstrahlung maximal energy is negligible i.e. a non - zero @xmath91 shifts only the compton edge .",
    "a spectrum measured via calorimetry is conventionally described by a function @xmath92 where a parent energy distribution @xmath93 incident on the detector is folded with a response function which is a gaussian with energy dependent width equal to the calorimeter energy resolution ( in our case @xmath94 ) , @xmath95 is a normalization constant and @xmath96 is the cutoff energy of the parent distribution .",
    "the original energy calibration is made to match the nominal compton edge @xmath97 ( fig.2 , upper scale ) by applying a differentiation deconvolution method to find the cutoff energy .",
    "this method unfolds the spectrum by numerical differentiation to reveal a nearly gaussian peak ( inverted ) within the spectrum fall - off range and assigns the peak position to the cutoff value .",
    "the main drawback of this method comes from ignorance of the parent distribution which results in a shifted answer in case of non - flat distributions as follows from ( [ eqfold ] ) .",
    "therefore , to extract the @xmath89 , @xmath90 values from the spectra we have used a more precise approach ( fitting via ( [ eqfold ] ) ) and have applied the differentiation method only to find the fit ranges around end points where the differentiated spectra peak , since outside of these ranges the spectra contain no information about the cutoff energies .",
    "such localization also helps to avoid possible bias of the fit results caused by physical effects affecting the spectra and not entering in the function @xmath98 .",
    "dominating among these effects are photon conversions between the interaction point and the calorimeter , detector nonlinearity and spatial non - uniform response .",
    "these effects change the shape of the spectra in a way the function ( [ eqfold ] ) is not able to describe adequately over the full energy range which is expressed also in ref .",
    "@xcite and is noticeable for original fits shown on fig.18 and fig.21 of the same ref .",
    "fitting the function @xmath98 to the background spectrum with the beam - gas bremsstrahlung cross - section  @xcite as the parent distribution and 2 free , variable parameters @xmath96 , @xmath95 , we get @xmath99 , ( see fig.2 )",
    ". the fit range is predefined by numerical differentiation of the spectrum as discussed above . from a similar fit to the background subtracted compton spectrum ( from fig.21 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) by @xmath98 with the compton cross - section  @xcite as parent distribution , we find ( fig.2 inset ) . according to the derived numbers @xmath89,@xmath90 and relations ( [ eqrat]),([eqnm1 ] ) we have the compton edge at well below from the nominal @xmath100 value and a vacuum index for the @xmath101 photons @xmath102 which is responsible for such reduction .",
    "now we return to the above mentioned systematic effects to estimate their possible influence on the obtained cutoff energies .",
    "the non - evacuated path of @xmath8 beam line serves as an extended target to convert them into @xmath103 pairs , subject to continuous energy loss and multiple scattering before registration by the calorimeter .",
    "this modifies the spectra by enhancing lower energy parts without affecting the highest detected energies from non - converted @xmath8-quanta .",
    "the most significant instrumental source affecting the result is the detector non - linear response @xmath104 under a given energy @xmath105 with from the quoted nonlinearity of @xmath68 at @xmath106 ( @xmath107 corresponds to a conventional calorimetric nonlinearity arising from shower leakage ) .",
    "this brings the ratio ( [ eqrat ] ) to @xmath108 with a corresponding correction of @xmath109 for @xmath33 and half of that value as the correction error .",
    "another possible source of the edges mismatch would arise if the bremsstrahlung and compton beams incident on calorimeter are separated in space . propagating the quoted spatial non - uniformity of the calorimeter @xmath67 ( @xmath110 ) to the value of @xmath33",
    "we finally have @xmath111 with statistical and systematic non - uniformity , nonlinearity errors displayed separately .",
    "for completeness of the analysis , we discuss a few additional systematic sources which have no significant effect on the energy distributions .",
    "first is the adc electronic pedestal with a width equal to @xmath112 and a measured systematic shift of the mean of @xmath113 .",
    "this is neglected , since the pedestal spread is incorporated into the energy resolution while the shift is less than the result s smallest , statistical error by almost one order of magnitude .",
    "next is an emission of multiple photons by a single electron bunch resulting in enhanced maximal detected energies due to a pile - up in the calorimeter .",
    "using a poisson distribution and evaluating the quoted single photon emission probability @xmath114 at the given compton rate , one readily has probabilities for 2 photon emission @xmath115 and @xmath116 for compton and bremsstrahlung respectively .",
    "the latter number is too small to cause any considerable shift of @xmath89 , since the whole bremsstrahlung spectrum contains less than a few pile - up events .",
    "concerning the compton edge , correcting for pile - up would only aggravate the observed energy reduction .",
    "the same is true also for non - linear compton scattering events where an electron emits two or more photons at once .",
    "in ref .  @xcite one can find a compton asymmetry ( fig.3 ) measured by the slc polarimeter where high power laser pulses of @xmath117 circular light interact with longitudinally polarized bunches of @xmath118 electrons under a crossing angle of @xmath119 and recoil electrons are registered by an array of cherenkov counters installed downstream of two momentum analyzing bending magnets .",
    "each channel of the detector integrates multiple electrons per pulse , within a certain energy range according to its position in the array . following a detailed description of the polarimeter setup in  @xcite one",
    "infers that energies detected in the @xmath95-th channel are constrained by @xmath120 where @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 which is the channel size and @xmath125 is the compton kinematic endpoint distance from the channel 7 inner edge which also depends on the initial electron beam position relative to the detector .",
    "information about the photon speed is encoded into the relation of the compton maximal and asymmetry zero crossing energies according to eqn.([eqnm11 ] ) .",
    "a coarse granularity of the detector ( binning in fig.3 ) , however , makes it difficult to apply this simple kinematic method .",
    "instead one can utilize dynamic features of the compton scattering in the case of @xmath126 . using an invariant representation of the compton process in ref .",
    "@xcite , for longitudinal polarization of the incident electron beam one can write the cross - section as @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the classical electron radius , @xmath129 is the electron beam and circular light polarizations product , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 with @xmath133 being the photon s initial four - momentum , and @xmath134 , which is the kinematic parameter defined above .    to introduce a refraction index into the cross - section , we modify @xmath23 entering in @xmath135 according to ( [ eqpk ] ) and scale cross - section ( [ eqnxs ] ) by a factor of @xmath136 which accounts for a change of the delta function @xmath137 to @xmath138 in the phase space of the outgoing photon .",
    "in addition we use ( [ eqnm1 ] ) and energy conservation to eliminate @xmath34 and express the cross - section in terms of @xmath139 .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath140 measured in a given detector channel @xmath95 is a product of @xmath129 and an analyzing power @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) where @xmath143 with @xmath144 being the scattered electron energy limited by the channel s energy acceptance @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eqhorz])-([asym ] ) that in the case of @xmath147 , the parameters @xmath125 and @xmath129 establish horizontal and vertical scales respectively ( energy and asymmetry ) in fig.3 .",
    "however , these variables alone are not sufficient for a satisfactory description of the asymmetry distribution as indicated by a least squares fit performed with only two free parameters @xmath125 and @xmath129 . ref .",
    "@xcite also reports about interchannel inconsistencies which dictate the choice and use of only one channel ( number 7 ) for the polarization measurement .    to extract the photon speed we add one more free parameter @xmath148 and use the polarized compton cross - section modified by dispersion , assuming a constant refraction index across the entire energy range of the measured asymmetry .",
    "now the @xmath149 minimization converges with @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( fig.3 ) , which yields @xmath153 for photons in the energy range @xmath154 .",
    "an influence of the detector response on the asymmetry is quoted in  @xcite to be about 1% , which is much smaller than statistical fluctuations and we ignore it . assuming perfect circular polarization of the laser light",
    ", @xmath129 equals the electron beam polarization , which is measured to be @xmath155 from the channel 7 asymmetry .",
    "both numbers agree within statistical and declared 1.41% systematic  @xcite errors , and at the same time the @xmath126 hypothesis allowed the asymmetry spectrum to be fitted successfully .    although the obtained result is more precise compared to the hera observation , it is less reliable because of the multi - electron generation - detection scheme and a theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the multi - particle mode , in general , poses difficulties to separate and treat the systematics and it also forced us to abandon the clear kinematic approach utilized in the case of the hera polarimeter , while the method applied for modification of the compton cross - section is somewhat heuristic and may introduce theoretical errors .",
    "the observed value of the index , obtained from one sample of the hera polarimeter data , is statistically significant and does not contradict any previous experimental result ( fig.1 ) .",
    "it is below unity testifying that @xmath101 energy photons are moving faster than light ( by @xmath156 ) .",
    "however a slac experiment shows that for photons of energy @xmath157 , the departure from the speed of light is at most @xmath158 .",
    "although the sign of the effect alone may be favorable for some theories discussed in sec.1 , the detected magnitude is too large to be associated with polarized electromagnetic or gravitational vacuum .",
    "so , the outcome is unexpected , especially in view of the sharper limits for surrounding energies ( see fig.1 ) and it is interesting to see whether the result can stand an examination by dedicated measurements and/or rigorous analysis of other pieces of data .",
    "the author would like to thank a.  t.  margarian for useful discussions and to m.  lomperski for providing measurement details and pointing to some sources of systematic uncertainties of the hera polarimeter .",
