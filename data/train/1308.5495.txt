    "supercapacitors store energy at the electrode / electrolyte interface without involving faradaic reactions ; this confers on them characteristics very distinct from batteries .",
    "they can be used as high - power generators and can undergo one million charge / discharge cycles without deterioration .",
    "nevertheless , compared to batteries , they suffer from a relatively low energy density .",
    "there are four principal components in supercapacitors on which we can act to optimize these systems : the active matter , the current collectors , the separator and the electrolyte .",
    "as the energy stored in a supercapacitor is proportional to the capacitance and the square of the operating voltage ( @xmath0 ) , the improvements will come by optimizing the electrode morphology , which determines the capacity of the system , and the electrolyte , which sets the maximum voltage by its decomposition limit  @xcite .",
    "the modifications of these two components will also impact the power which can be delivered by the capacitor , as this property is a function of the maximum voltage and resistance ( @xmath1 ) .    focusing on liquid electrolytes ,",
    "different fluids have been studied up to date which are suited for distinct applications .",
    "aqueous electrolytes are attractive because of their high ionic conductivities ( @xmath2  400  ms.@xmath3 ) , which allow for a higher specific power , but they have relatively narrow electrochemical windows ( 1.2  v )  @xcite . on the contrary , ionic liquids ( ils ) and organic electrolytes exhibit larger electrochemical windows , up to 5  v and 3  v respectively  @xcite .",
    "ionic liquids have a number of attractive properties such as low combustibility , high thermal stability and low vapor pressure , which make them _ a priori _ safe .",
    "they are also adaptable thanks to the broad choice of anions and cations that can be combined . from mixtures of different ils ,",
    "various operating conditions can be ameliorated , for example the working temperature range can be enlarged  @xcite .",
    "the major drawback of using ils in supercapacitors is their low ionic conductivity ( @xmath4  15  ms.@xmath3 )  @xcite .",
    "consequently , in many experimental studies and applications of supercapacitors , organic electrolytes using acetonitrile ( acn ) or propylene carbonate ( pc ) as solvent are still used instead of pure ils  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that adding acn to ils enhances greatly the ionic conductivity of the system  @xcite .",
    "the structural and dynamic effects of solvation on the bulk properties of electrolytes have been examined by experiments  @xcite and simulations  @xcite but the interfacial properties of the mixtures are less thoroughly studied , especially from a theoretical standpoint .",
    "recent electrochemical measurements on carbide - derived carbon electrodes immersed in pure 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ( [ emi][tfsi ] ) and in a 2  m solution of [ emi][tfsi ] in acn display an unexpected peak in the cyclic voltammetry ( cv ) curve of the solution  @xcite .",
    "some experimental results indicates that this peak is not associated with a faradaic process and a clear explanation is missing .",
    "molecular simulations of the interface between porous carbons and organic electrolytes may be needed to explain this effect , but , even simpler interfaces between , for example , planar electrodes and solutions may contribute to a better understanding .",
    "the gouy - chapman theory , which describes highly - diluted solutions at smooth planar interfaces , is not applicable for common electrolytes as typical salt concentrations are 1  m or more . to study these interfaces",
    ", there is a need for more complex theories  @xcite or molecular simulations which correctly describe ionic correlations . up - to - date",
    ", molecular simulations involving the interface between various carbon structures ( carbon nanotubes  @xcite , slit pore  @xcite , graphite  @xcite ) and organic electrolytes have mainly focused on the liquid side of the interface . in the present study",
    ", we investigate the influence of mixing two salts , namely 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ( [ bmi][pf@xmath5 ) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ( [ bmi][bf@xmath6 ) , with acn on the electrolyte and electrode properties .",
    "we use a comparison between pure ils and their corresponding 1.5  m organic electrolytes to highlight the modifications of structural and capacitive properties associated with solvation .",
    "the use of a constant potential approach to model the electrodes , instead of the constant charge methodology , allows us to gain knowledge about the polarization of the electrodes by the electrolytes and how this is affected by the acn solvent .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations are conducted on four different electrolytes surrounded by model graphite electrodes : pure [ bmi][pf@xmath5 and [ bmi][bf@xmath6 and their corresponding 1.5  m solutions with acn as a solvent .",
    "all molecules are represented by a coarse - grained model in which the forces are calculated as the sum of site - site lennard - jones potential and coulombic interactions .",
    "parameters for the ions and carbon atoms are the same as in our previous works  @xcite : three sites are used to describe the acn and the cation and the anions are treated as spheres .",
    "the two ils differ by the nature of the anion , the diameter of pf@xmath7 being larger than the one of bf@xmath8 by approximately 0.5  . the model for acn",
    "was developed by edwards _",
    "et al . _",
    "all the parameters of the force field are recalled in table  [ param ] and a schematic representation of the molecules is given in figure  [ cgm ] .",
    "each electrode is modelled as three fixed graphene layers .",
    "the electrolyte is enclosed between two planar electrodes and two - dimensional periodic boundary conditions are applied , i.e. there is no periodicity in the direction perpendicular to the electrodes .",
    "figure  [ snapshot ] shows a snapshot of the simulation cell for the acn-[bmi][bf@xmath6 mixture with a salt concentration of 1.5  m. the molecular dynamics simulations were conducted in the nvt ensemble using a time step of 2  fs and a nos - hoover thermostat  @xcite with a time constant of 10  ps .",
    "the ewald summation is done consistently with the two - dimensional periodic boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "pure ils and electrolyte solutions are simulated at 400  k and 298  k respectively .",
    "these temperatures were chosen because of the very high viscosities of the pure ils at room temperature ( 261.4  mpa.s for [ bmi][pf@xmath5 and 100.2  mpa.s for [ bmi][bf@xmath6  @xcite ) and the fact that acn boils at 355  k. nevertheless , static properties usually depend weakly on the temperature for conditions far from phase transitions .",
    "thus , the qualitative conclusions raised in this article should hold for pure ils at lower temperatures and the comparison with acn - based electrolytes is relevant .",
    "the sizes of the simulation cells are chosen in order to reproduce the experimental densities of the electrolytes .",
    "table  [ cells ] gathers the lengths and number of molecules for all the simulation cells .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     looking at the surface charge versus potential drop plots and capacitance values , it clearly appears that the trend is the same as for the polarization of the electrodes : in the solutions , the behavior of the two salts become very similar on both the positive and negative sides , despite the strong asymmetry in size and shape between the ions ( this is particularly true for [ bmi][bf@xmath6 ) . on the positive electrode side ,",
    "the capacitance is increased when going from pure ils to solvated ions , and the reverse is observed for the negative electrode side , leading to a mean value of around 4.6  @xmath9f.@xmath10 for both interfaces in the electrolyte solutions .",
    "this uniformization of the capacitive behaviors upon addition of a solvent is consistent with the molecular density profiles which are dominated by a small dependency on the electrode potential for acn and with the charge distributions functions which are more gaussian shaped for electrolyte solutions compared to pure ils . in the presence of acn in the first adsorbed layer ,",
    "specific adsorption effects due to the molecular details appear to be wiped off , even if at this concentration highly - diluted theories remain irrelevant .",
    "we would like to point out here that we could expect a lower capacitance value for the diluted electrolytes compared to the pure ionic liquids as the screening efficiency decreases with a decrease of ionic concentration .",
    "our results reveal that this not the case .",
    "it presumably reflects the fact that the solvent enables cations and anions to be more readily separated by the application of a potential difference so that the layer compensating the charge on the electrode is narrower consistently with the reduction of the overscreening in electrolyte solutions .",
    "the fact that the capacitance of each interface is nearly constant upon addition of a solvent was also observed in other molecular simulations .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the interface between acn-[bmi][bf@xmath6 electrolytes and graphite with a mass fraction of acn ranging between 0  % and 50  % ( their highest mass fraction is slighlty smaller than our 63  % mass fraction of acn for the acn-[bmi][bf@xmath6 solution ) .",
    "they show that the capacitance of the system is nearly constant and comprised between 6.5  @xmath9f.@xmath10 and 7.0  @xmath9f.@xmath10 . with a slightly different electrolyte , acn-[emi][bf@xmath6 , shim _",
    "also reach the conclusion that the capacitance depends only weakly on the presence of the solvent .",
    "interestingly , they do not observe the uniformization of the negative and positive capacitances , and we observe quantitative differences with their results . our simulation procedure differs a lot from theirs due to the use of a constant potential approach for the electrodes with coarse - grained electrolytes in our case , while these authors have used a constant charge method with all - atom force fields .",
    "this observation should be explored in future works .",
    "we note that in a completely distinct electrolyte consisting of [ li][pf@xmath5 and solvent mixtures  @xcite , an asymmetry between negative and positive electrodes was noticed but , in this case , the dissymmetry between the anion and the cation is much more important .",
    "in this article we have examined the impact of the presence of non - ionic solvent on the structural , polarization and capacitive properties of the interfaces between planar graphitic electrodes and liquid electrolytes .",
    "the main effect of solvation on the structure of the interface is the reduction of the region where ionic / molecular layering is observed near the graphite electrodes .",
    "although the density of ions at the surface is lower in the solutions , this reduction in layering appears to result in a smaller reduction in the capacitance with respect to the pure ils than might be expected .",
    "the molecular density profiles also show that the acn molecules are only weakly affected by the potential difference applied between the electrodes .",
    "the reorganization of the layers upon charging of the electrodes varies when going from pure ils , in which a polarization of the ionic layers occur , to electrolyte solutions , where a mechanism based on exchange of ions between the different layers is at play . from the coordination numbers at the interface ,",
    "we conclude that , for the electrolyte solutions , the coordination number of acn molecules around ions is more affected by the interface than the coordination numbers between ions .",
    "the polarization of the electrode is highly influenced by the type of electrolyte present .",
    "solvent - free electrolytes generates charge distributions functions with skewed shapes and are impacted by the nature of the ions . on the contrary , charge distributions curves for electrolyte solutions have shapes closer to gaussians and do not depend on the size of the anion . in pure ils , the polarization of the electrode also leads to a larger dissymmetry between positive and negative applied potentials compared to electrolyte solutions because of the asymmetry of the ions .",
    "the effect of solvation extends to the capacitive properties of the system .",
    "when a solvent is present in the electrolyte , the size / asymmetry of the ions do not generate different capacitances and the two solutions have similar properties .",
    "moreover , the dissymmetry between positive and negative potentials is attenuated and a general linear trend is observed for the surface charge versus potential drop curves .",
    "this work raises conclusions about equilibrium interfaces between planar graphitic electrodes and free - solvent / electrolyte solutions which can not be extended straightforwardly to porous electrodes systems .",
    "the effect of solvation in supercapacitors including porous electrodes will require further work in order to understand experimental results and design new electrolytes / electrodes .",
    "the impact of solvation on dynamic properties and charge / discharge processes should also be investigated to go further into the understanding of supercapacitors .",
