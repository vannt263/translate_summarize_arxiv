    "this paper is concerned with the question of reconstructing a vector @xmath0 in a finite - dimensional _ complex _ hilbert space @xmath1 when only the magnitudes of the coefficients of the vector under a redundant linear map are known .",
    "specifically our problem is to reconstruct @xmath2 up to a global phase factor from the magnitudes @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a frame ( complete system ) for @xmath1 .",
    "the real case was considered in @xcite . here",
    "we develop the theory for the complex case .",
    "a previous paper @xcite described the importance of this problem to signal processing , in particular to the analysis of speech .",
    "the problem appears in x - ray crystallography under the name of `` phase retrieval '' problem ( see @xcite ) where the frame vectors are the fourier frame vectors .",
    "the case of the windowed fourier transform was considered in the 80s @xcite ; see also @xcite for a frame based approach to this case .",
    "a different approach is taken in @xcite .",
    "the authors propose a novel algorithm adapted to compactly supported signals and fft that uses individual signal spectral powers and two additional interferences between signals .",
    "a 3-term polarization identity has been used in @xcite together with the angular synchronization algorithm .",
    "recently the authors of @xcite developed a convex optimization algorithm ( phaselift ) and proved its ability to perform exact reconstruction in the absence of noise , as well as its stablity under noise conditions . in a separate paper , @xcite",
    ", the authors developed further a similar algorithm in the case of windowed dft .",
    "the original requirement of @xmath5 vectors has been relaxed to @xmath6 in @xcite .",
    "similar convex optimization solutions have been proposed by the authors of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite studied the duality gap in this approach and obtained a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a dual certificate .    while writing this paper , we become aware of @xcite where the authors obtained similar results to the injectivity criteria presented here , as well as to the cramer - rao lower bound derived in this paper .",
    "we will comment more later in the paper .",
    "we also acknowledge the paper @xcite where certain lipschitz bounds have been obtained in the real case .",
    "the real case of the stabilty bounds obtained here are presented in a separate paper @xcite together with additional results for the real case .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we define the problem explicitly . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we describe new analysis results .",
    "specifically we analyze in more detail spaces of symmetric operators of constrained signature , and then we show how they are related to the phaseless recovery problem .",
    "our results are canonical , meaning they are independent to a particular choice of basis . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we establish two robustness results : bi - lipschitzianity of the nonlinear analysis map , and the cramer - rao lower bound ( crlb ) . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we present a new reconstruction algorithm based on the least - square method .",
    "we also obtain robustness bounds to noise .",
    "its performance is analyzed in section [ sec6 ] and is compared to the crlb .",

    "the collection of coefficients @xmath20 represents the analysis of the vector @xmath0 given by the frame @xmath14 . in @xmath1",

    "we prove some convergence results and we study its performance in the noisy case .",
    "we shall derive the cramer - rao lower bound ( crlb ) for this model and compare the algorithm performance to this bound .",
