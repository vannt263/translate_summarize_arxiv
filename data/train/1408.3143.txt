    "it is well - known that giant planet occurrence is strongly dependent on stellar metallicity for main - sequence and subgiant stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent works suggest that planet occurrence is also correlated with stellar mass , with the probability of a star hosting a jovian planet rising linearly over the mass range 0.2 to 2.0 m@xmath3 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , it has recently been argued that the subgiants / giants studied at the massive end off the planet - host mass distribution ( representing a stars after they evolve off the main sequence ) may not be as massive as initially suggested @xcite .",
    "if the stellar masses have been previously underestimated , the nature and interpretation of the correlation between planet occurrence and stellar mass would need to be revised .",
    "an accurate assessment of the stellar masses of subgiants and giants is thus required to fully understand this apparent correlation . in this work ,",
    "we start to address this question by performing a spectroscopic analysis of the giant / subgiant star hd 185351 .",
    "three spectra were obtained for hd 185351 using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ; @xcite ) on the keck i 10-meter telescope ( mauna kea , hawaii ) .",
    "they have a nearly complete wavelength coverage from 3650 to 7950  , resolution r = 77,000 and s / n @xmath4 250 per resolution element at @xmath46700  .",
    "we measured the atmospheric parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath2 g , [ fe / h ] and @xmath5 ) in lte using an iterative method based on the excitation and ionization equilibria of fe i and fe ii lines , ares , moog @xcite and kurucz odfnew model atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the results were : @xmath0 = 5035 @xmath1 29 k , @xmath2 g = 3.30 @xmath1 0.08 , [ fe / h ] = 0.10 @xmath1 0.04 and @xmath5 = 1.08 @xmath1 0.03 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we also measured the lithium abundance in lte using a spectral synthesis technique , the atmospheric parameters above and moog .",
    "our iterative procedure ( see @xcite for details ) tested different combinations for a(li ) and a single gaussian broadening fhwm@xmath7 .",
    "a reduced @xmath8 minimization was used to find the best fit between the observed and synthetic spectra , which occurred for the following parameters : a(li ) = 0.77 @xmath1 0.07 and fhwm@xmath7 = 0.152  ( see figure [ synth_li ] ) .",
    "we measured the physical parameters of hd 185351 using the atmospheric parameters @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] , the v magnitude ( 5.18 @xmath1 0.01 ) from the hipparcos catalog @xcite , the revised hipparcos parallax ( 24.49 @xmath1 0.22 mas ; @xcite ) , and the param web interface with the parsec evolutionary tracks @xcite .",
    "the results were : m = 1.77 @xmath1 0.04 m@xmath3 , r = 4.85 @xmath1 0.11 r@xmath3 , @xmath2 g = 3.29 @xmath1 0.02 , and age = 1.79 @xmath1 0.09 gyr .",
    "following the analysis of , we also obtained an independent estimate of the stellar mass from the analysis of the non - standard mixing history of hd 185351 : m = 1.64 @xmath1 0.06 m@xmath3 ( see figure [ models_lithium ] ) .",
    "the independently measured masses are not only consistent , but also lie within the interval ( @xmath91.6 @xmath10 2.0 m@xmath3 ) defined by the extensive analysis of @xcite , which includes results from interferometry , spectroscopy , and asteroseismology ( see their figure 7 ) .",
    "the mass of hd 185351 was determined using different methods and all estimated values are higher than 1.5 m@xmath3 .",
    "these measurements are consistent with hd 185351 being the evolved counterpart of an a dwarf , which supports the results from @xcite .",
    "we plan to extend the spectroscopic analysis described here to the entire sample of @xmath9300 evolved stars .",
