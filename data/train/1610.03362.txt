    "classification is the task of recognizing the modulation type ( mt ) employed at the transmitter of a detected signal , which is required for various military and civilian applications .",
    "in particular , cognitive radio with adaptive mts @xcite is a promising future application of mc . in such scenario ,",
    "the transmitter dynamically adjusts the data rate by switching the modulation order depending on channel conditions . by employing automatic / blind mc at the receiver , the communication overhead can be reduced .",
    "mc techniques are of two types : feature - based and likelihood - based @xcite .",
    "while adding more antennas in mimo technology @xcite increases spectral efficiency , the complexity of optimal likelihood - based mc @xcite increases exponentially with this addition , especially when each layer is allowed to have a different mt .",
    "an alternative low complexity sub - optimal feature - based mc scheme for mimo systems exploits the higher - order cyclic cumulants ( ccs ) of the baseband intercepted signal @xcite .",
    "moreover , without perfect channel state information ( csi ) , independent component analysis has been used @xcite to blindly estimate the channel in conjunction with either likelihood - based or feature - based mc .    in this letter , we propose near - optimal low - complexity likelihood - based mc for mimo systems .",
    "we first decompose the channel matrix employing subspace decomposition , and then detect the mt on the partially decoupled stream of interest using a modified likelihood metric .",
    "a joint mc and subspace data detection receiver is also proposed . regarding notations , bold upper case , bold lower case , and lower",
    "case letters correspond to matrices , vectors , and scalars , respectively .",
    "scalar norm , vector norm , conjugate transpose , and inverse are represented by @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we consider , a spatial multiplexing mimo system with @xmath4 transmit , and for simplicity @xmath5 receive antennas : @xmath6 with @xmath7^{t}\\!\\in\\!\\mathcal{c}^{m\\!\\times\\!1}$ ] being the received complex vector , @xmath8\\!\\in\\!\\mathcal{c}^{m\\!\\times\\!n}$ ] the complex channel matrix , @xmath9^{t}\\!\\in\\!\\mathcal{c}^{n\\!\\times\\!1}$ ] the transmitted symbol vector , and @xmath10 the complex additive white gaussian noise vector with zero mean and variance @xmath11 ( @xmath12=\\sigma^{2}{\\mathbf{i}}_n$ ] ) .",
    "each symbol @xmath13 belongs to a normalized complex constellation @xmath14 of size @xmath15 , thus @xmath16 and @xmath17\\!=\\!1 $ ] .",
    "consequently , the signal to noise ratio ( @xmath18 ) is defined in terms of the noise variance as @xmath19 .",
    "the bit representation of symbol @xmath13 is a coded bit - interleaved sequence @xmath20 .    in a mimo system that supports non - uniform mts , each of the @xmath4 transmitted symbols",
    "is assumed to be drawn from one of @xmath21 possible mts , with equal probability .",
    "we develop mc schemes to estimate the mt per - layer , using the received signal @xmath22 and assuming perfect csi .",
    "the optimal likelihood - based mc scheme decides on the mt that has the maximum likelihood within multiple hypotheses .",
    "bayesian hypothesis testing is performed on the @xmath23 possible hypotheses , corresponding to @xmath24 finite lattices ( @xmath25 ) , with likelihoods : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the probability density function . under statistical independence between the components of @xmath28 , and assuming uniform priors , @xmath29 , where @xmath0 denotes the constellation set cardinality , the decision metric is derived as : @xmath30    noting that @xmath31 , and neglecting the term @xmath32 which is assumed fixed over hypotheses , the resultant log - map decision metric is : @xmath33 which is the average likelihood ratio test ( alrt ) solution .",
    "solving equation is computationally intensive , because for each @xmath34 we have to calculate @xmath35 exponential terms .",
    "however , one of these terms is dominant and corresponds to the scaled maximum likelihood ( ml ) distance : @xmath36 using the approximation @xmath37 , we get : @xmath38 which is the near - optimal max - log - map classifier .",
    "while max - log - map eliminates exponential operations , the number of euclidean distance computations per hypothesis remains exponential , and computing the likelihood functions @xmath23 times is exhaustive .",
    "an alternative approach is required , that separates the transmitted signals for individual treatment , which results in only @xmath39 distance computations per layer @xmath40 and hypothesis @xmath41 .",
    "this is achieved by the per - layer sub - optimal alrt solution . with perfect csi at the receiver ,",
    "the sub - optimal alrt classifier finds the zero - forcing ( zf ) equalized output @xmath42 , computes the scaled noise variance @xmath43 , and generates the likelihood function per layer @xmath40 as follows :    @xmath44    we seek a classifier that decouples the layers while maintaining distance metrics that are close to that of log - map .",
    "while the standard qr decomposition ( qrd ) decomposes the channel matrix @xmath45 into an upper triangular matrix ( utm ) @xmath46\\in\\mathcal{c}^{n\\times n}$ ] with @xmath47 , and a unitary matrix @xmath48 , the so - called wr decomposition ( wrd ) scheme punctures in addition the red - marked entries above the diagonal in fig .",
    "[ f : matrices](a ) .",
    "we aim at transforming @xmath45 into a punctured utm @xmath49 as shown in fig .",

    "we assume @xmath52 $ ] to have a full column rank , and impose the condition on the column vectors of @xmath53 to have unit length , i.e. , @xmath54 for @xmath55 , so that the transformed noise vector will maintain an unaltered covariance matrix ( @xmath56=\\sigma^{2}{\\mathbf{i}}_{n}$ ] ) .",
    "the brute force approach for computing @xmath53 involves extensive matrix inversions , which is computationally intensive and prone to numerical error . an alternative approach @xcite consists of qrd followed by elementary matrix operations .",
    "let @xmath45 be qr - decomposed such that @xmath57 .",
    "consider row @xmath58 of @xmath59 , and assume the @xmath60 entry @xmath61 , @xmath62 , is to be nulled .",
    "we have @xmath63 and @xmath64 , from which it follows that @xmath65 .",
    "therefore : @xmath66 @xmath67 puncture the required entry and update @xmath68 accordingly .",
    "finally , the non - zero entries in row @xmath40 of @xmath69 are updated , and @xmath70 is normalized to have unit length : @xmath71 @xmath72 repeating this on required entries ( bottom to top , right to left ) , the resulting @xmath68 is @xmath53 , and @xmath69 is the desired punctured @xmath49 .      to generate the likelihood functions on all layers ,",
    "the @xmath4 streams are decoupled , one at a time , by cyclically shifting the columns of @xmath45 and generating the punctured utms , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : matrices](b - e ) .",
    "alternatively , a minimal swapping operation can put the layer of interest at the rightmost column location , and hence a decomposition as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : matrices](b ) will always follow .",
    "we represent this swapping operation by a permutation : @xmath73 for @xmath74 and at a layer of interest @xmath40 .",
    "each permuted @xmath75 is then wr - decomposed into @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we first partition @xmath78 , @xmath77 , and permuted @xmath28 as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "then , the modified distance metric is expressed in terms of @xmath87 as :    @xmath88    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the slicing operator . since @xmath91 is a diagonal matrix , slicing",
    "is applied to the individual elements of the vector @xmath92 in parallel .    accumulating @xmath93 observations before deciding on a winning hypothesis , the proposed likelihood functions at layer @xmath40 are :    @xmath94    @xmath95    @xmath96    note that optimal slicing in equation requires knowledge of mts on all remaining layers , which is infeasible in an independent per - layer scheme .",
    "therefore , we propose to do slicing assuming dense constellations , @xmath971024-qam for example .",
    "the idea of slicing over a dense constellation comes from the work in @xcite on multiuser mimo ( mu - mimo ) detection , where it has been shown that near - optimal data detection can be achieved while assuming interferers to have high order mts , which captures the geometry of constellations while minimizing errors .",
    "note that 1024-qam was not considered in @xcite because of the entailed complexity of ml detection .",
    "this is not an issue in our case , since subspace detection only employs the dense constellations in slicing operations .",
    "table [ table : complexity ] compares the upper bound on computational complexities of studied classifiers , in terms of the number of euclidean distance computations , as well as exponential and logarithmic operations , where @xmath98 is the largest possible mt .",
    "note that the table does not account for the less significant preprocessing computations ( zf equalization , qrd / wrd ) that can be computed once for a large number of observations when the channel variation is slow . while computations in optimal alrt are exponential in the number of transmit antennas , they are linear in the proposed subspace - based classifiers and sub - optimal alrt solution ( the latter is less complex since its distance computations are one dimensional ) .",

    "in order to generate the log - likelihood ratio ( llr ) of the @xmath102 bit of the @xmath103 symbol @xmath104 via subspace detection , we compute two distance metrics defined as : @xmath105 where @xmath106 , the sets @xmath107 and @xmath108 correspond to subsets of symbol vectors in @xmath109 , having in the corresponding @xmath102 bit of the @xmath103 symbol a value of @xmath100 and @xmath110 , respectively , and the distance metrics are expanded as in equation .",
    "the unscaled llrs are then calculated as : @xmath111    if @xmath49 is unpunctured , the parallel slicing operation of equation can not be executed , and successive interference cancellation ( sic ) is applied to obtain @xmath112 . expanding the distances in equation via sic results in a special subspace detector called layered orthogonal lattice detector ( lord ) @xcite , and expanding the distances in equations and accordingly results in lord - log - map and lord - max - log - map classifiers , respectively .",
    "be it detection or mc , while independently processing a layer of interest , the mts on the remaining layers are unknown , and parallel slicing or sic is conducted assuming 1024-qam .",
    "this means that the distance metrics computed for data detection are identical to those computed in equations and for the winning hypothesis , and thus combining mc and detection results in a minimal mc overhead .",
    "the joint mc and detection setup is summarized in algorithm [ propalg ] and architecturally illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : architecture ] . for @xmath93 observations ,",
    "the detection routine is called @xmath93 times for all hypotheses , and the resulting distance metrics are stored in memory .",
    "concurrently , the likelihood of each hypothesis is computed .",
    "eventually , the metrics corresponding to the winning hypothesis are retrieved for llr processing .",
    "the receiver can run in this joint mode for a sufficient number of observations and then switch back to regular data detection .",
    "moreover , since the operations on different layers are independent , the proposed algorithm can be parallelized on multiple processing units . finally ,",
    "if the system had more receive antennas ( @xmath113 ) , the `` thin '' form of the qr decomposition for tall matrices can be used , and other modifications immediately follow .",
    "swap the column of interest @xmath40 with column @xmath4 in @xmath45 as in equation decompose the channel matrix as in equation calculate the distance metrics for all hypotheses as in equation while assuming the mts on the remaining layers to be 1024-qam calculate the classifier likelihood function as in equations and repeat steps 3 and 4 for @xmath93 observations , accumulate likelihoods , and decide on the winning hypothesis forward the distance metrics that correspond to the winning hypothesis for bit llr generation as in equation",
    "several mc and detection schemes were simulated in the context of @xmath114 mimo .",
    "we considered five hypotheses of mts per layer , varying with equal probability on every new frame , which are @xmath115 , qpsk , 16-qam , 64-qam and 256-qam , with @xmath115 representing a constellation having one entry of zero power , corresponding to the case when the transmitting antenna is silent .",
    "note that an all - qam set of hypotheses that only differs by modulation order is hard to classify , but is more likely to occur in future standards .",
    "the winning hypothesis was decided after accumulating @xmath116 observations .",
    "turbo coding was used , with a code rate of @xmath117 and @xmath118 decoding iterations . moreover , in addition to the regular channel @xmath45 , we considered a correlated channel @xmath119 , where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the transmit and receive antenna correlation matrices , respectively , with a correlation factor of 0.3 .",
    "the proposed classifiers are compared in terms of correct classification ratio ( ccr ) . fig .  [",
    "f : plot1 ] shows that for uncorrelated channels , the best performance is achieved by subspace - log - map and lord - log - map classifiers , when the mts on the remaining layers are assumed to be 1024-qam .",
    "the subspace - max - log - map and sub - optimal alrt classifiers lag behind , but are also capable of achieving unity ccr at high @xmath18 .",
    "however , assuming 64-qams instead of 1024-qams resulted in bad classification performance for both subspace and lord based classifiers .",
    "the exhaustive log - map classifier with @xmath122 observations only was added as a reference , and the much less complex proposed approaches outperformed it .",
    "also , the reference feature based ( 4 order ccs ) classifier performed very bad with an all - qam set of hypotheses .",
    "[ f : plot2 ] then shows that for highly correlated channels , only subspace - log - map performs well at high @xmath18 , approaching the upper log - map bound .",
    "the corresponding coded frame error rate ( fer ) performance of the proposed detectors with high channel correlation is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : plot3 ] .",
    "the detectors were simulated assuming the layer of interest to use 64-qam ( following successful per - layer mc ) , while the mts at the remaining layers were unknown , and randomly hopping over possible hypotheses .",
    "both lord and subspace detectors were tested , assuming the remaining mts to be 1024-qam or 64-qam .",
    "these detectors were compared to the regular mt - aware lord and subspace detectors that have perfect knowledge of mts on all layers .",
    "while regular subspace detection beats lord by more than @xmath123{db}$ ] , only assuming 1024-qam in conjunction with subspace detection was able to achieve near mt - aware performance .",
    "this declares the subspace - based classifiers winners in the context of joint mc and detection .",
    "finally , not shown in this letter for lack of space , are the fer plots with uncorrelated channels , where all schemes achieved near - mt - aware performance , and the ccr plots with imperfect csi , that show remarkable performance deterioration ( mitigating channel estimation errors is beyond the scope of this work ) .",
    "low - complexity per - layer mc schemes have been proposed for mimo systems , based on subspace decomposition .",
    "it has been shown that assuming the modulation type on all layers except the layer of interest to be a dense constellation results in good classification performance .",
