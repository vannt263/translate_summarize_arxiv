    "clusters of galaxies represent unique signposts in the universe , where the physical properties of the cosmic diffuse baryons can be studied in great details and used to trace the past history of cosmic structure formation ( e.g. rosati et al .",
    "2002 ; voit 2005 , for reviews ) . as a result of adiabatic compression and shocks generated by supersonic motion during shell crossing and virialization ,",
    "a hot thin gas permeating the cluster gravitational potential well is formed .",
    "typically this gas , which is enriched with metals ejected form supernovae ( sne ) explosions through subsequent episodes of star formation ( e.g. matteucci & vettolani 1988 ; renzini 1997 ) , reaches temperatures of several @xmath7 k and therefore emits mainly via thermal bremsstrahlung in the x - rays . at such temperatures most of the elements are either fully ionized or in a high ionization state .",
    "+ particularly evident in x  ray spectra of galaxy clusters are the strong transitions to the @xmath8 level ( k  shell ) of the h  like and he  like ions of iron in the energy range 6.76.9 kev .",
    "below 2 kev , @xmath9 level ( l  shell ) transition of iron and @xmath10 elements can be detected , especially in the low temperature region in the centers of the so  called cool core clusters , that are characterized by a strong peak in the surface brightness distribution , and therefore short cooling times .",
    "spatially resolved cc clusters show a peak in the metal distribution associated to the low temperature core region ( e.g. de grandi & molendi 2001 and 2002 , hereafter dm01 and dm02 ) .",
    "although the amount of energy supplied to the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) by sne explosions depends on several factors ( e.g. the physical condition of the icm at the epoch of the enrichment ) and can not be obtained directly from x  ray observations , the radial distribution of metals , as well as their abundance as a function of time , are crucial information to shed light on the cosmic star formation history and to trace the effect of sn feedback on the icm .",
    "+ several analyses have been presented in the literature with the aim to study the radial distribution of metals in clusters of galaxies .",
    "finoguenov , david & ponman ( 2000 ) performed a spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopic analysis of 11 relaxed clusters observed by rosat and asca , deriving a radial distribution of single heavy elements such as fe , si , ne and s. they found that the total fe abundance decreases significantly with radius in all clusters , while the si , ne and s abundances are either flat or decrease less rapidly .",
    "dm01 derived radial metallicity profiles ( mainly driven by fe ) of 17 nearby clusters observed by bepposax .",
    "they found a strong enhancement in the abundance in the central regions of the cc clusters .",
    "a flatter metallicity profile was observed instead for the non - cool core clusters in their sample .",
    "since all the ncc clusters show signs of recent merger activity , they suggested that the merger events may have redistributed efficiently the metal content of the intracluster medium .",
    "irwin & bregman ( 2001 ) derived iron - abundance profiles for 12 clusters with @xmath11 observed by beppo sax .",
    "although they investigated the differences between cc and ncc clusters in a less systematic way than dm01 , they found a negative gradient in the abundance profiles of all the cc clusters and to a lesser significance also in the ncc clusters . similarly to dm01 , they found that cc clusters have higher metallicity than ncc clusters at every radius .",
    "it is worth to say that the aforementioned papers investigated the metallicity trends only within @xmath12 .",
    "spatially resolved measures of the metal abundance in galaxy clusters were performed also with xmm - newton . in particular tamura et al .",
    "( 2004 ) analyzed a sample of 19 x - ray bright relaxed clusters , obtaining elemental abundances of fe , si , s and o. they found that while the distribution of fe , si and s is generally peaked toward the center , the o abundances are uniform throughout the cluster , pointing out to a different origin among these metals , most likely in sne ia and ii .",
    "more recently vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have derived temperature and metallicity profiles for 11 low - redshift clusters observed by chandra .",
    "the clusters in their sample however are all cc clusters , presenting a very regular overall x - ray morphology and showing only very weak signs of dynamical activity .",
    "although they have not analyzed the metallicity profiles rescaled to the virial radius of the cluster ( as they did for the temperature profiles ) a negative gradient of @xmath13 is present in all the objects in their sample .",
    "however , almost all the spatially - resolved metallicity profiles are measured in local clusters ( @xmath14 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "measurements of the metal content of the intracluster medium at high@xmath15 has been obtained with single emission - weighted estimates from chandra and xmm - newton exposures of 56 clusters at @xmath16 in balestra et al .",
    "they measured the iron abundance within ( 0.15 - 0.3)@xmath17 and found a negative evolution of @xmath18 with the redsfhift , with clusters at @xmath19 having a constant average fe abundance of @xmath20 , while objects in the redshift range @xmath21 show @xmath18 significantly higher ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "such evolution is not driven entirely by the presence of the cool cores .",
    "this result has been recently confirmed by maughan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present measurements of the radial temperature and metallicity profiles of a sample of 12 clusters with temperatures larger than 6 kev observed with chandra at intermediate redshift , @xmath23 .",
    "we take advantage of the acis superior spatial and spectral resolution to investigate in a systematic fashion the differences that may exist between cc and ncc clusters .",
    "the spectroscopic measurements of the icm temperature and metallicity allow to characterize statistically the radial profiles and to quantify their gradients in this unexplored redshift region .",
    "all the uncertainties are quoted at 1@xmath24 ( 68% ) for one interesting parameter .",
    "the abundance estimates are relative to the compilation of cosmic values given in anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) ( hereafter ag89 ) , unless otherwise stated .",

    "therefore we reset the correction performed by @xmath30 on the level=1 event file , so that the hot pixels and the afterglow events may be properly removed by the improved ciao tool @xmath31 , ( introduced after sdp version ds 7.4.0 ) .",
    "a new level=1 event file is then created ( through the ciao tool @xmath32 ) to apply the latest calibration files to the data ( e.g. apply the newest acis gain maps , apply the time - dependent acis gain correction , apply the acis charge transfer inefficiency correction , etc . ) .",
    "moreover in the case of observations telemetered in vfaint mode it is possible to reduce the background using the additional screening of the events with significantly positive pixels at the border of the @xmath33 event island .",
    "two further filtering steps are then required to obtain the level=2 event files , i.e. filter for bad grades ( using asca grades ) and for a `` clean '' status column and apply the good time intervals ( gtis ) supplied by the pipeline .",
    "the final step is to examine background light curves during each observation to detect and remove the periods of high background , due to flaring episodes .",
    "we perform the flare detection and removal following the recommendations suggested in markevitch et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ; both the total and the clean exposure times are listed in table  [ sample ] .",
    "most of the observations are slightly affected by background flares thus we were able to use practically all the exposure time .",
    "the only exceptions are obsid 3205 , 4193 , 906 and especially obsid 1666 , where @xmath34 ks of the exposure were lost due to high background .",
    "+      an accurate subtraction of the background is crucial to perform a correct study of the spectral properties of the clusters in our sample , especially in their outskirts .",
    "since we are dealing with extended objects , occupying most of the acis field of view we need to use a compilation of the blank - field observations , processed identically to the cluster observation ( i.e. as described above ) and reprojected onto the sky using the aspect information from the cluster pointing .",
    "it is worth noticing that the synthetic backgrounds correspond to longer exposure times ( @xmath35 msec ) than any of our observations , giving us a very good sampling in the estimate of the background to subtract .",
    "moreover , in order to tailor the background to our data we follow the recommendations given in the ciao web - pages . in particular we renormalize the blank - fields to the background in each observation , considering a region of the acis field of view practically free from cluster emission ( mainly acis - s1 for acis - s observations , and acis - s2 for acis - i observations ) and a spectral band ( 9.5 - 12 kev ) where the chandra effective area is nearly zero , therefore all the observed flux is due to the particle background .",
    "in addition to the particle - induced background we check also if the diffuse soft x - ray background could be an important factor in our observations and if appropriate adjustments are needed . for each observation , we follow the procedure of vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , extracting a spectra in the source - free regions of the detector , subtracting the renormalized blank - field background and fitting the residuals in xspec v11.3.2p ( in the 0.4 - 1 kev band ) with an unabsorbed mekal model , whose normalization was allowed to be negative .",
    "the best - fit model obtained is therefore included as an additional component in the spectral fits ( with its normalization scaled by the area ) .",
    "however , in every observation the adjustments required are minimal and do not affect significantly the determination of @xmath36 and @xmath13 , even at large radii .",
    "this is also due to the properties of the clusters in our sample , whose high @xmath36 values ( @xmath37 kev ) even in the resolved outer regions are not affected significantly from the method applied for the subtraction of the diffuse soft background .",
    "the @xmath38 statistics require grouping of the spectra , having at least 20 counts per bin , in order to be able to approximate the poissonian distribution of counts with a gaussian . on the contrary , cash statistics do not require any grouping and represent a more reliable ( and less biased ) approach to fit the data .",
    "indeed , it is well known from the literature ( see e.g. nousek & shue 1989 ; balestra et al .",
    "2007 ) that the @xmath38 statistics systematically `` sees '' the observed spectra softer than the real ones .",
    "this usually leads to an overestimate of the slope of the observed spectra in the case of a simple power - law fit , while in the case that a thermal model is fitted to the data , the temperature measured is usually underestimated . as a test to see whether this systematics is present also in our data , we have decided to apply both these fit statistics .",
    "we find that for all the clusters of the sample , a systematically lower temperature is measured with the @xmath38 ( on average @xmath39 lower , depending on the cluster ) . on the other hand",
    "no obvious systematic trend is observed in the determination of @xmath13 , being the variation in the best  fitting value of the metallicity in each cluster ranging between @xmath40 and @xmath41 with no preferential direction . to avoid the dependence on the grouping method , and the bias in the best - fit temperature , we decide to use the modified cash statistics , as implemented in xspec v11.3.2p , to determine the best - fit parameters and their uncertainties .      in order to study the radial properties of the cluster emission",
    ", we subdivide each cluster in annuli ( circular or elliptical , depending on the morphology of the cluster ) centered on the x - ray emission peak . in the more disturbed clusters , where an emission peak is not clearly identifiable , we assume the center of the cluster to correspond with the x - ray centroid at @xmath42 .",
    "we require each region to have at least @xmath43 net counts , so that it would be possible to estimate the temperature and the metallicity of the annulus with sufficient accuracy . for each cluster",
    "the outermost annulus corresponds to an area where the intensity of the source in the 0.8 - 8 kev band is roughly equal to that of the background .",
    "we extract a spectra from each annulus after excluding the 3@xmath24 point sources detected by the ciao tool @xmath44 .",
    "the source list produced is also inspected by - eye in order to remove possible additional sources not detected by @xmath44 ( especially in the regions where the diffuse emission from the cluster is brighter ) .",

    "except for the inner radial bin where the metallicity in cc objects can be higher by 50 per cent than in ncc ones , the cc and ncc profiles are very similar and consistent within the errors .",

    "this might be due to the different method used to compute @xmath136 , being in dm01 work estimated as fit with a constant to the radial metallicity profile . however , apart from the inner radial region , the discrepancy between the local profiles and the ones at intermediate redshits are within 1@xmath24 . using the same method to determine @xmath136 on our data , we find that the values of @xmath186 are fully consistent with dm01 .      all the analysis described in the current section",
    "has been performed adopting the ag89 compilation of photospheric abundances .",

    "therefore , we have also performed the fits using solar abundances by a05 to check whether adopting the `` old '' ag89 values might have introduced any bias in our analysis .",
    "+ the shape of the @xmath13 profile for both the cc sample and the ncc sample resembles very closely that observed in figure  [ z_cc_vs_nocc_mean ] for the ag89 values of @xmath13 . however to better quantify this comparison we fitted also these new values with a power - law functional .",
    "we measure @xmath236 with @xmath237 .",
    "if we compare the result of the fit with the last two rows in the first column in table  [ bestfit ] , it is quite clear that the slope of the power - law in both the cc and ncc sample is consistent with what we obtained using the ag89 values ( well within the 1@xmath24 uncertainties ) and the difference is only in the normalization . as expected , this result might indicate that our metallicities are mostly driven by iron and that the contribution of the @xmath10 elements to the determination of the abundances is negligible .",
    "indeed , all our clusters have a temperature larger than @xmath238 kev , therefore the abundance measures are dominated by the fe - k@xmath10 line . as a further test to this hypothesis we tried to fit the fe abundance independently from the @xmath10 elements abundances .",
    "to this aim we used a vmekal model where the abundances of o , mg , si and s were tied - up to the same value and fitted as a single free parameter ( in order to reduce the number of free parameters ) , while the other elements ( apart from fe ) were frozen at solar . while the fe abundance remained always consistent with the value of @xmath13 measured considering the metallicity as a single parameter , in almost all the spectra we could not find any statistically significant detection of a contribution from @xmath10 elements .",
    "their abundances has been measured as upper limits in most cases ( generally @xmath239 ) , and as very low values in the rest of the spectra ( generally @xmath240 , often consistent with @xmath241 at 1@xmath24 ) .",
    "this is true even in the inner part of the clusters in the sample , where the signal - to - noise of the spectra is higher and in principle it may be easier to detect the presence of elements other than iron .",
    "+ these results suggest that the measure of @xmath13 in our cluster sample consists mainly in a measure of iron metallicity .",
    "therefore , adopting the ag89 solar abundances instead of the a05 ( which have different @xmath242 ratios ) produces only a difference in the value of the relative @xmath13 measured .",
    "this does not introduce any bias in the analysis of the radial profiles , since the absolute value of @xmath13 does not change and only the reference value assumed for the solar metallicity experience a variation .",
    "we investigate the correlation of the central slopes of the temperature and metallicity profiles with the central cooling time in each cluster .",
    "to this aim , the values of @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @xmath223 ( normalized to the average temperature , the average metallicity and the virial radius measured in each cluster , respectively , as described in section  3 ) with @xmath142 have been considered to characterize the cooling cores .",
    "we find that the most robust correlation is present between the slope @xmath245 of the temperature profiles , @xmath246 and @xmath247 , with a spearman s @xmath248 rank correlation value of -0.87 that corresponds to a significance of the non - correlation case of @xmath249 . in the @xmath250 and @xmath251 relations , the values of the spearman s @xmath248 are 0.44 and 0.54 , corresponding to a significance of 0.15 and 0.07 , respectively .",
    "the exponent @xmath245 correlates with @xmath247 , being higher at lower values of @xmath247 , with all the cc clusters having @xmath252 and @xmath6 ( figure  [ alphatc ] ) .",

    "these clusters were chosen in the 0.1 - 0.3 redshift range , regardless of their shape .",
    "we computed the cooling time of the clusters , subdividing the sample in 7 cool core clusters and 5 non  cool core clusters .",
    "this subdivision allowed us to compare the two categories in a systematic fashion , following the approach of dm01 .",
    "we performed a spectral analysis in radial bins of each cluster in the sample requiring each bin to have @xmath253 counts , fitting the spectra with a thermal model with galactic absorption .",

    "the main results coming from our work can be summarized as follows .",
    "+    * the temperature profiles in the inner @xmath2 have , on average , a positive gradient , @xmath254 with @xmath255 in cc systems , whereas it is almost flat in ncc systems .",

    "the general trend of our cc sample is fully consistent with vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) at @xmath144 .",
    "the low number statistics above @xmath145 prevents us from any statistically significant comparison between the two samples at @xmath147 . *",

    "a steep negative gradient is observed ( @xmath258 ) in the central regions . at @xmath150 ,",
    "a power - law reproduces well the distribution of the spectral measurements , with a slope that is marginally steeper in cc clusters ( @xmath259 ) than in ncc clusters ( @xmath260 ) . *",
    "comparing our averaged metallicity profiles with the ones in dm01 , we found that our values of @xmath186 are systematically higher , with differences up to 50% within @xmath2 of cc systems .",
    "this may be explained by the different method adopted in dm01 to estimate @xmath136 , as best - fit with a constant over the entire metallicity profile , without any exclusion of the central core . *",
    "using the solar abundances from asplund ( 2005 , a05 ) gives consistent results with what we obtain using the values by anders & grevesse ( 1989 , ag89 ) , with a discrepancy only in the normalization ( as expected , @xmath261 higher ) but not in the slope of the @xmath13 radial profiles .",
    "together with the fact that , in most cases , we were able to measure the @xmath10 elements only as upper limits , this indicates that our metallicities are mostly driven by iron and that adopting the ag89 solar abundances instead of the a05 results in a difference only in the absolute values of the @xmath13 measured but does not introduce any bias in the radial profile analysis . * fitting a power  law shape to the temperature profiles , @xmath262 , we found that @xmath245 correlates strongly with the cluster cooling times , being higher at low values of @xmath247 , with all the cc clusters having @xmath263 and @xmath6 .",
