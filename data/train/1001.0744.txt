    "the formal uncertainties for the opacity corrected line intensities given by the hfs fits are negligible ( see table  [ tab : hfsfits ] ) . in order to independently estimate the uncertainty of the ( 1,1 ) integrated line intensities obtained from the hfs fit , we divide the full barnard  1 data set into three subsets , 58  min integration time each , and fit each subset independently . from the three measurements we derive a 2.7% uncertainty for the mean which we use as an estimate of the uncertainty of our final ( 1,1 ) measurement . adding in quadrature the corresponding statistical uncertainty for  of 4.2%",

    "a comparison of our fractionation measurements with the nitrogen `` superfractionation '' models of @xcite is of interest . in their figure  3 , @xcite present results of time - dependent models of the evolution of the @xmath0n/@xmath1n enhancement ratios in key species , including ammonia .",

    "the time at which the maximum fractionation is reached depends strongly on the initial fraction of nitrogen in molecular form , but is typically of order 1  myr .",
    "the enhancements of the magnitude that we measure can be present very early on , or a few tenths of a myr after the peak enhancement time .",
    "the @xcite model results depend strongly on the gas temperature  at 7  k , significantly higher enhancements are found in the gas - phase ammonia fractionation , as compared to 10  k. the sources we have studied are somewhat warmer than the model clouds considered by @xcite .",
    "it would thus be extremely interesting to extend our measurements to colder clouds , such as ldn  1544 or ldn  134n , with central temperatures of order 7  k. our present observations are exploratory in nature , but show that accurate measurements of nitrogen fractionation in ammonia in cold ism sources are clearly feasible using the gbt .",
    "a focused observing program of a larger , carefully selected sample of prestellar cores with varying temperatures and gas densities would allow significant progress in our understanding of nitrogen fractionation in local ism and its possible implications for the existing measurements in various solar system reservoirs .",
