    "quantum information processing  ( qip ) is a fundamental resource for the next generation of technological devices based on quantum principles .",
    "the field of qip is attracting a continuously increasing interest since its birth , a few decades ago , and branches into several subfields : quantum computation , quantum communication , quantum algorithms , and quantum cryptography , just to name a few  @xcite .",
    "possible broad - reaching applications of such devices are triggering experimental and theoretical efforts , which aim at controlling and manipulating the systems on a quantum scale and characterizing their many - body properties .    in this paper , we focus on quantum state transfer  ( qst ) , perhaps the simplest communication protocol , designed to send a quantum state through interconnected on - chip architectures , from one node to another .",
    "qst can be useful in short distance communications to avoid interfacing problems with flying qubits . in its simplest version , a qst task is performed between parties connected via quantum spin channels , that is , @xmath0d interacting spin-@xmath1 chains working as data buses , see fig .  [ f.1qubitqstqed ] .    ,",
    "encoded on spin @xmath2 , and residing on the first site of a spin chain , is meant to be transferred to spin @xmath3 , which resides on site @xmath4 , at some time @xmath5 , by exploiting the coherent dynamics of the quantum channel @xmath6 .",
    "[ f.1qubitqstqed ] ]    since the seminal paper by bose  @xcite , numerous protocols acting on spin-@xmath1 chains have been proposed and investigated in order to achieve a high qst fidelity .",
    "these can be classified into two broad groups , namely time - dependent and time - independent protocols  ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein for review ) . in the former protocols ,",
    "the transfer operation is performed by a time - modulation of the interaction parameters of the spin model ; whereas , in the latter scenario , the interaction parameters are kept fixed during the execution of the qst protocol . notwithstanding the rapid improvement of the ability to control the interactions between quantum spins  ( especially in cold atom set - ups  @xcite ) , the accuracy required to perform time - dependent protocols seems to be still out of reach .",
    "hence , in this paper , we will focus on time - independent qst protocols .",
    "as far as the transfer of the quantum state of a single qubit is concerned , it has been shown  @xcite that perfect - qst and perfect entanglement distribution are completely equivalent .",
    "in other words , if a quantum channel is capable of transferring a quantum state with unit fidelity from a sender to a receiver , then it will also allow for a maximally entangled state to be distributed between these two parties .",
    "a high - fidelity qst data bus can be employed as an entangling gate between two spins  @xcite , producing , e.g. , any one of the maximally entangled bell states with two qubits : @xmath7 and @xmath8 , here expressed in the ( logical )  basis of eigenstates of the pauli matrix @xmath9 .",
    "the shared entangled state can be then exploited , via the celebrated teleportation protocol  ( tp )  @xcite , as a resource to teleport an unknown quantum state from one location to another , thus achieving the desired qst .",
    "the tp requires the sender to perform a two - qubit measurement , followed by the transmission of two bits of classical communication to the receiver , which report the result of the measurement .",
    "finally , a conditional unitary operation on the target spin is carried out by the receiver himself . as a consequence",
    ", one - qubit qst can be achieved deterministically by the use of a two - qubit bell state teleportation channel .",
    "unfortunately , there is not such a clear - cut equivalence when multipartite qst is addressed , that is , when the quantum state to be transferred has @xmath10 qubits .",
    "the reason for this difficulty in connecting the @xmath11-qst with multipartite entangled states , which would be useful as a resource for implementing a teleportation channel , is mainly due to the in - equivalence of entangled states in the multipartite regime .",
    "for instance , the entanglement of teleportation @xmath12  @xcite has been adopted as a quantifier of the capability of an entangled state to act as a teleportation channel .",
    "it turned out that 4-qubits ghz - states , @xmath13 , have @xmath14 and only special classes of 2-qubit states can be deterministically teleported  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a different class of maximally entangled 4-qubit entangled states , the so - called w - states , @xmath15 , have @xmath16 , and no deterministic 2-qst is possible . actually , it is possible to teleport a 2-qubit state by using a 4-qubit entangled state  @xcite , and an explicit protocol for generic @xmath11-qst has been introduced in terms of the so - called @xmath17 generalized bell states  @xcite , which , indeed , have unit teleportation entanglement .    notwithstanding the possibility to teleport an @xmath11-qubit state by means of suitable entangled states , shared by the sender and the receiver , in this paper we address the question in terms of the _ transport _ of the state .",
    "this presents some advantages with respect to the use of a teleportation channel : first of all , in order to perform the @xmath11-qst via tp , there is the need to implement generalized bell measurements , which up to now seem to be highly non - trivial ; furthermore , sender and receiver need to protect efficiently their shared pure entangled state from the environment , as the entanglement of teleportation has to be unity in order to achieve a successful tp .",
    "if this is not the case , little can be said .",
    "indeed , to be best of our knowledge , an analysis of @xmath11-qst via tps employing mixed states has yet to be performed , and not much is known about the efficiency of such tasks .",
    "therefore , we consider the case of qst in a setting where the state is encoded at one end of the spin chain",
    ". then , by exploiting the natural dynamics of the quantum channel , we aim at retrieving the same state  ( up to some unitaries ) at the other end , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ f.nqubitqsta ] .     of the sender",
    "qubits is aimed at being transferred to the receiver spins via the quantum channel @xmath6 .",
    "[ f.nqubitqsta ] ]    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ s.overview ]",
    "we review some of the main single - qubit qst mechanisms based on spin chains ; in sec .",
    "[ s.dynamics ] we solve the many - body dynamics for our model , which will be used in sec .  [ s.results ] to present our main results on the qst fidelity . finally , in sec .  [ s.conclusions ]",
    "we draw some conclusions .",
    "in this section , we will focus on @xmath0-qst as performed by means of an open and finite spin-@xmath1 chain , like the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ f.1qubitqstqed ] .",
    "the hamiltonian describing its dynamics is taken to be of the @xmath18-heisenberg type , with nearest - neighbour interactions only , plus a magnetic field along the @xmath19-axis : @xmath20 the initial state , encoded on the sender spin @xmath2 , reads @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , whereas the rest of the chain , including the quantum channel @xmath6 and the receiver @xmath3 , is initialized in @xmath23 .",
    "the evolution of the overall state is @xmath24 . by tracing out all of the spins but @xmath3 ,",
    "one obtains the  ( generally mixed ) state of the receiver spin on site @xmath4 : @xmath25 .",
    "the fidelity between the state transferred to the receiver on site @xmath4 , and the state encoded initially on spin @xmath0 by the sender , is given by  @xcite : @xmath26    the quality of a qst - bus , however , can not be simply evaluated by considering the fidelity of the transfer of a single , specific input state , but rather by an average qst - fidelity obtained over some classes of states .",
    "we will consider here the average fidelity @xmath27 , evaluated by integration over the bloch sphere of all possible pure input states , as a qst figure of merit . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the average fidelity is given  ( up to a phase that can be adjusted by a suitable magnetic field ) by the expression @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the transition amplitude of the excitation  ( or , equivalently , of the spin - flipped state @xmath30 ) from site @xmath0 to site @xmath4 . the total magnetization along the @xmath19-axis commutes with the hamiltonian given by eq",
    ".  [ e.hambus ] , then , the subspaces with a fixed number of excitations are invariant under its action . as a consequence",
    ", the amplitude is straightforwardly evaluated via @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the single - particle eigenvalues and eigenvectors of eq .",
    "[ e.hambus ] .",
    "now , the average fidelity @xmath27 depends  ( monotonically ) only on the modulus of the excitation transition amplitude @xmath33 from site @xmath0 to site @xmath4 .",
    "besides , @xmath29  ( eq .  [ e.frs ] ) is a sum of products of the overlaps of any ( single particle ) eigenstate with the initial and final states @xmath30 and @xmath34 .",
    "each these overlaps bring in a phase factor determined by the eigenvalues @xmath35 and the @xmath36-sum in eq .",
    "[ e.frs ] runs over all the eigenstates of eq .",
    "[ e.hambus ] .",
    "it turns out that the different components of @xmath29 interfere destructively .",
    "accordingly , a very low quality of 1-qst is obtained for uniformly coupled spins in long chains , unless a specific procedure  @xcite is applied to single - out some of the terms in the sum given in eq .",
    "[ e.frs ] .    from eq .",
    "[ e.fid01 ] it is evident that , as far as @xmath0-qst is concerned , high - fidelity protocols aim at maximizing the transfer of the spin - flipped state @xmath30 from site @xmath0 to site @xmath4 . in order to maximize @xmath29 , within time - independent hamiltonian protocols ,",
    "several strategies have been adopted , which can be broadly classified in : a. ) couplings - engineering methods  @xcite , b. ) ballistic transfer  @xcite , and c. ) rabi - like dynamics  @xcite .    in protocols relying on methods of the a.)-type ,",
    "the nearest - neighbor spin couplings are chosen in such a way that the energy spectrum becomes linear , thus allowing a dispersion - less transfer of the excitation ; an instance of such a coupling set is given by @xmath37 , which yields a perfect qst , that is @xmath38 . with regards to ballistic transfer settings of the b.)-type ,",
    "the main idea is to modify only the couplings of the sender and the receiver to the rest of the spin chain .",
    "these couplings are chosen in such a way that , even tough the overall energy spectrum is non linear , most of the modes prominently involved in the dynamics reside in a portion of the spectrum , which is approximately linear .",
    "for example , by tuning @xmath39  ( with @xmath40 reading @xmath41 for @xmath42 ) average fidelities higher than @xmath43 are achieved  @xcite ; furthermore , allowing also for modulations of the second and last - but - one couplings , @xmath44 gets as high as @xmath45 in arbitrarily long chains  @xcite . finally , methods of c.)-type consist in restricting the dynamics to just two  ( or three ) modes of the spectrum in such a way that effective rabi oscillations of the excitations take place between the endpoints of the chain .        up to now , these schemes have been applied mainly to the qst of a single qubit  ( even if this does not mean , in general , that the dynamics is restricted to the single excitation subspace , as the chain could be initialized in a state different from @xmath46 ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , it would be of uttermost importance to have a _ single _ channel able to perform different qip tasks , such as , for instance , a qst of arbitrary @xmath11-qubits or a qst involving more than just a single sender and receiver .    in the next section we will focus on a specific rabi - like 1-qst protocol  ( fig .",
    "[ f.1qubitqsta ] ) , presented in ref.@xcite , with the idea to investigate its capability to be used as an @xmath11-qst bus .",
    "the relevant feature of the protocol is given by the presence of ( strong ) magnetic fields applied only on the spins sitting at sites 2 and @xmath47 , whereas the spin - spin coupling is assumed to be uniform .",
    "these strong magnetic fields on the next - neighboring spins to the sender and the receiver , named hereafter _ barrier _ spins , play a crucial role in effectively decoupling the end - spins from the rest of the chain .",
    "then , an effective rabi - like hamiltonian @xmath48 can be written down , with the two modes @xmath49 bi - localized on sender and receiver : @xmath50 . in the following",
    ", we will investigate if such a scheme succeeds also in the @xmath11-qst scenario .",
    "it is worth mentioning that such a setup has been already extended in ref .",
    "@xcite to perform a one - to - many routing protocol .",
    "in the usual single qubit qst scenario  ( sketched in fig .  [ f.1qubitqstqed ] ) , a pure state @xmath51 is encoded at time @xmath52 in a spin located at site @xmath0  ( the sender ) .",
    "the aim is to retrieve , at some time @xmath53 , the very same state in a spin located at site @xmath4 ( the receiver ) , via the natural  ( coherent ) dynamics of the channel ruled by @xmath54 .",
    "as the number of excitations ( flipped spins ) remains constant during the evolution , the dynamics takes place in the single excitation subspace , as witnessed by eqs .",
    "[ e.fid01 ] and  [ e.frs ] .",
    "though , one of the applications of the qst protocol is , for instance , to transfer the output of a qip task , performed by a quantum processor , to another quantum device , and often it is the case that such an output consists of more than just one qubit . as a consequence ,",
    "the output has to be encoded in a larger hilbert space , say , that of @xmath11 spins ; so the resulting dynamics of the @xmath11-qst may take place simultaneously in all the subspaces with @xmath55 excitations .",
    "these components of the initial state have to evolve in such a way that there exists a certain time @xmath5 at which the initial state is rebuilt at the @xmath11 receiver spins .",
    "it is evident that not only the analytical , or numerical , complexity of the problem increases exponentially with the number of spin flipped in the initial state , but also the achievement of high - quality transfer may become considerably more difficult w.r.t . the 1-qst case .",
    "one way to circumvent the problem would be to employ @xmath11 _ identical _ , non - interacting quantum channels , each transferring one component of the state  @xcite . however , there are some drawbacks in this configuration : all of the @xmath11 channels have to posses exactly the same technical specifics , as each of the component of the whole @xmath11-qubit quantum state has to be delivered at the same time @xmath53 to the corresponding receiver . unfortunately , experimental imperfections are likely to modify the coupling strength between spins in the different chains , thus yielding different optimal transfer times @xmath5",
    ". these times could also depend on the state to be transferred , thus making the @xmath11-qubit qst a quite involved task in the presence of disorder ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "furthermore , in order to fulfil the assumption of coherent dynamics , the @xmath11 quantum channels have to be efficiently protected from detrimental environmental effects , which may result in a demanding technical ( and economical ) request . also endowing the qip devices by moving parts give rise to easily presumable difficulties .",
    "it would be therefore interesting to explore the possibility to use a single quantum channel to perform arbitrary @xmath11-qubit qst , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ f.nqubitqsta ] .    to achieve this goal",
    ", we now turn our attention to a detailed analysis of the dynamics in the many - body regime .",
    "let s consider the spin model given in eq .",
    "[ e.hambus ] , with uniform couplings  ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) .",
    "this model can be mapped to a spinless fermion model via a jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite @xmath58 where we have taken @xmath59 as our energy unit .",
    "notice that the magnetic field is zero everywhere but at the barrier spins , on sites @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where it takes the same value @xmath62 .",
    "the most general initial @xmath11-qubit pure state reads  @xcite @xmath63 the last spin @xmath11 of the sender string is coupled to the first barrier spin on site @xmath64 , which is the first spin of the quantum channel @xmath6 , made out of @xmath65 spins ; the last spin of @xmath6 ( the second barrier ) is coupled to the first spin of the @xmath11 receiver string , located at the other end of the chain . in fig .",
    "[ f.1qubitqstmb ] an instance of such a setting is shown for @xmath66 .",
    "finally , both the spin bus @xmath6 and the receiver spins are initialized in @xmath67 .",
    "we now derive the time - evolved state of the whole system , sender spins , quantum channel , and receiver spins .",
    "because @xmath68 commutes with the total number of excitations , each @xmath11-fermions sector is an invariant subspace , and the analysis can be performed separately in each subspace .",
    "a lengthy but straightforward calculation shows that @xmath69 here the arrow in @xmath70 indicates that the set of @xmath71 s are ordered with the location label increasing from left to right , i.e. , @xmath72 , whereas @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 is the determinant of the minor made up by taking the @xmath76 rows and the @xmath77 columns of the matrix @xmath78 , which diagonalizes the @xmath79 hamiltonian matrix given by eq .",
    "[ e.hfermrealspace ] , in the single particle sector , while @xmath80 denotes the @xmath81-th eigenvalue .",
    "finally , by tracing out all of the spins but the receivers , the reduced density matrix @xmath82 , describing the spins located on sites @xmath83 and embodying the qst target string , is obtained .",

    "we conveniently adopt the following parametrization for 2-qubit pure states @xmath95 where @xmath96 are local rotations acting on the first and second spins , and @xmath97 characterize the initial amount of entanglement  ( as the concurrence is given by @xmath98 ) .      with the reduced density matrix written above",

    "we see that the fidelity increases if larger and larger values values of @xmath100 are taken , and that spin - buses with an odd number of sites perform better that even - numbered ones , both because they require smaller barrier magnetic fields and because the optimal times where the maximum fidelity is achieved are shorter .     for the 2-qst through chains made of @xmath103 and @xmath104 spins , for time scans @xmath105 $ ] and @xmath106 $ ] , respectively  ( upper and lower panels ) .",
