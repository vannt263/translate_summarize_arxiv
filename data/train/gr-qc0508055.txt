    "several authors have considered charged distributions of matter @xcite , although it is well known that astrophysical objects are not significantly charged . nevertheless , in some stages of the gravitational collapse",
    "even a small amount of charge can change the final state of the body",
    ". some interesting features of charged collapsing matter justify any effort to get physical insight by studying this problem .",
    "for instance , naked singularities can be prevented @xcite ; the final geometrical structure left over after the complete collapse of a spherically symmetric charged source and of a chargeless rotating star are similar @xcite ; cauchy horizons , gravitational repulsion and perhaps traversable wormholes are also possible @xcite .",
    "if the mathematical treatment is simplified , the evolution of a charged distribution of matter can be followed by the einstein  maxwell equations . in this paper",
    "we explore the self  similar gravitational collapse of charged spheres in the diffusion approximation .",
    "it is well known that dissipation due to the emission of massless particles is a characteristic process in the evolution of massive stars .",
    "the only plausible mechanism to carry away the bulk of binding energy of the collapsing star , leading to a neutron star or black hole , is neutrino emission @xcite .",
    "it seems clear that the free  streaming process is associated with the initial stages of the collapse , while the diffusion approximation becomes valid toward the final stages .",
    "the junction conditions at the boundary of a charged and dissipative sphere have been considered with outgoing heat flow and radiation flux @xcite . on the other hand , the field equations admit homothetic motion @xcite .",
    "applications of homothetic similarity range from modeling black holes to producing counterexamples to the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite . in particular , homothetic charged and isotropic ( or anisotropic ) fluids have been studied @xcite .",
    "we observe in the literature that much work has been done under static conditions and dusty charged matter .",
    "also authors make additional assumptions such as equations of state or relationships between metric variables @xcite . in this paper",
    "we obtain a dynamical model from a simple solution to the homothetic motion , without any additional supposition except spherical symmetry and self  similarity . in section 2",
    "we write the field equations and the junction conditions .",
    "the equations at the surface of the distribution of matter are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we write the symmetry equations to describe self  similarity . in section 5 , we show an example from a simple solution which we discuss in the last section .",
    "let us consider a non  static distribution of matter which is spherically symmetric and consists of charged fluid of energy density @xmath0 , pressure @xmath1 , electric charge density @xmath2 and radiation energy flux @xmath3 diffusing in the radial direction , as measured by a local minkowskian observer comoving with the fluid",
    ". in radiation coordinates @xcite the metric takes the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are functions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the time  like coordinate : in the flat space ",
    "time @xmath7 is just the retarded time , so that surfaces of constant @xmath7 represent null cones open to the future ; @xmath8 is a null coordinate ( @xmath9 ) such that surfaces of constant @xmath8 and @xmath7 are spheres ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the usual angular coordinates .",
    "also , in this paper we use relativistic units ( @xmath12 ) .    the einstein field equations , * g * @xmath13*t * , are considered with the energy ",
    "momentum tensor * t * @xmath14*v*@xmath15*v*@xmath16*g*@xmath17*q*@xmath15*v*@xmath17*v*@xmath15*q*@xmath17*e * , where * v * and * q * are the four  velocity and the heat flux four  vector , respectively , which must be orthogonal ; * e * is the electromagnetic field energy ",
    "momentum tensor constructed with the maxwell field tensor * f * as is usually done . the maxwell field equations , * d*@xmath18*f*@xmath19*j * and * df*@xmath20 , are coupled minimally with gravitation , where * j*@xmath21*v * is the electric current four  vector .    because of the spherical symmetry , only the radial electric field @xmath22 is non  vanishing . if we define the function @xmath23 by the relation @xmath24 the inhomogeneous maxwell equations become @xmath25 and @xmath26 where the comma subscript represents partial derivative with respect to the indicated coordinate . the function @xmath23 is naturally interpreted as the charge within the radius @xmath8 at time @xmath7 . thus , the inhomogeneous field equations entail the conservation of charge inside a sphere comoving with the fluid , expressed by @xmath27    let @xmath28 be the velocity of matter as seen by a minkowskian observer moving at @xmath29 with respect to the local comoving frame ; the matter velocity in radiation coordinates is then given by @xmath30 introducing the mass function by @xmath31 we can write the einstein equations as @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35 @xmath36 + \\frac{3\\beta_{,r}}{8\\pi r}(2cc_{,r}/r - c^2/r^2)\\ ] ] @xmath37    we describe the exterior space ",
    "time by the reissner ",
    "vaidya metric @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the total mass and @xmath40 the total charge .",
    "it can be shown that the junction conditions to match the metrics ( [ i m ] ) and ( [ em ] ) , across the moving boundary surface @xmath41 , are equivalent to the continuity of the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 across the boundary , that is , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and to the equation @xmath46 where the subscript @xmath47 indicates that the quantity is evaluated at the surface @xmath41 .",
    "we have used the continuity of the radial electric field through the boundary assuming no surface free charge density , yielding @xmath48 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the discontinuity of the pressure at the boundary , @xmath49 , is a direct consequence of ( [ mv ] ) , ( [ ec2 ] ) , ( [ ec3 ] ) and the junction conditions @xcite .",
    "one of the surface equations is just ( [ mv ] ) evaluated at @xmath50 , which takes the form @xmath51 where ( [ mf ] ) has been used as well as the junction conditions for m , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "it is convenient to scale the variables by the initial mass @xmath54 , such that    @xmath55 defining the surface potential f and @xmath56 by @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( [ apch ] ) can be written in the form @xmath59 which is the first surface equation .",
    "the second surface equation relates the total mass loss rate to the energy flux through the boundary surface .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this equation can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 the third surface equation is the charge conservation law given by ( [ cc ] ) , evaluated at the boundary @xmath62    the fourth surface equation is model dependent .",
    "this correspond to the bianchi identity @xmath63 , given by @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "equation ( [ hidro ] ) is the generalization of that of tolman  oppenheimer ",
    "volkov for non  static and charged radiative situations @xcite ( see reference @xcite for the static case ) .",
    "self - similarity is invariably defined by the existence of a homothetic killing vector field @xcite .",
    "we shall assume that the spherical distribution admits a one  parameter group of homothetic motions .",
    "a homothetic vector field on the manifold is one that satisfies @xmath682@xmath69 on a local chart , where @xmath70 is a constant on the manifold and @xmath71 denotes the lie derivative operator . if @xmath72 we have a proper homothetic vector field and it can always be scaled so as to have @xmath73 ; if @xmath74 then @xmath75 is a killing vector on the manifold @xcite .",
    "so , for a constant rescaling , @xmath75 satisfies @xmath76 and has the form @xmath77    the homothetic equations reduce to @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are solutions if the self  similar variable is defined as @xmath88 in the next section we propose a simple solution which evolves toward staticity , rendering an inhomogeneous and dusty fluid sphere .",
    "the simple solution @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 satisfies the additional symmetry equations ( [ se1 ] ) and ( [ se2 ] ) , the charge conservation equation ( [ contcar ] ) , the continuity of the radial electric field and the continuity of the first fundamental form .",
    "now , with these solutions and the junction condition ( [ csf ] ) ( continuity of the second fundamental form ) , @xmath92 is determined by @xmath93    the heat flow at the surface is obtained from the conservation equation ( [ hidro ] ) evaluated at the surface , resulting in @xmath94 this last equation , together with ( [ omega ] ) , must be taken into account to integrate numerically the equations ( [ ap ] ) and ( [ fp ] ) . using a standard runge  kutta algorithm and the initial conditions @xmath95 and @xmath96 , we study the effect of charge on collapse . once the boundary evolution and its energetic are determined , we calculate the physical variables from the field equations .",
    "figures 17 show the results obtained for our simple solution . we shall discuss them in the next section .",
    "figure 1 displays the evolution of the surface for different values of the total charge .",
    "it is clear that the increase of the total charge favors the collapse in a first stage of the evolution . later",
    "the collapse is halted , with damped oscillations rendering a distribution which is less compact for greater total charge .",
    "we show in figure 2 how the bondi mass decreases and oscillates about the total charge ( given positive ) until reaching the same value of @xmath40 .",
    "figures 36 sketch the pressure @xmath1 , the density @xmath0 , the heat flow @xmath3 and the matter velocity @xmath97 .",
    "observe that the whole sphere of fluid becomes dust ( @xmath98 at all points ) and inhomogeneous when staticity is reached .",
    "it is interesting to note that the cooling proceeds with emission and absorption of energy and consequently all the shells bounce and contract as a unit , over and over , until reaching staticity in the whole sphere .",
    "also it is striking how the ratio @xmath99 is a function only of the bondi time , i.e. , it is the same at any point of the charged distribution ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "we would like to stress that our solution , in spite of its simplicity , behaves very well when one takes into account the results reported by other authors .",
    "the sphere collapses and rebounds as a unit @xcite , over and over , until reaching staticity .",
    "equilibrium configurations are possible , with no necessity of internal pressure ; moreover , electric charge halts the gravitational collapse @xcite",
    ". the spheres of charged matter can oscillate and the final static configuration is reached when the total mass is equal to the total charge @xcite , that is , the charged spheres of dust in equilibrium belong to the interior papapetrou  majumdar class @xcite .    finally , we make special mention of the herrera and ponce de len homothetic models @xcite . for a null radial pressure at the surface ( as a boundary condition )",
    "they find a charged dust . otherwise , the distribution is infinitely extended .",
    "from an altogether physical point of view , perhaps it is possible to find finite perfect ( and self  similar ) fluid sources with zero pressure at the surface , considering free  streaming as the inner transport mechamism . in general , herrera and ponce de len find that the total charge is less than the total mass .",
    "the equality will only be valid in the case of homothetic charged dust spheres .",
    "we benefited from research support by the consejo de investigacin under grant ci-5 - 1001 - 0774/96 of the universidad de oriente .",
    "we would like to thank loren lockwood for his helpful reading and valuable comments .",
