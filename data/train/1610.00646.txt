    "the purpose of relativistic nuclear collision experiments is the creation and study of nuclear matter at high energy densities .",

    "collective motion of the particles emitted from such collisions is of special interest because it is sensitive to the equation of state in the early stages of the reaction  @xcite .",
    "directed flow was the first type of collective motion identified among the fragments from nuclear collisions @xcite , and in current analyses , is characterized by the first harmonic coefficient in the fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution of the emitted particles with respect to each event s reaction plane azimuth ( @xmath1 )  @xcite :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the azimuth of a charged particle , or more often , the azimuth of a particular particle species , and the angle brackets denote averaging over all such particles in all events . in some experimental analyses",
    ", @xmath0 is evaluated directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , then a correction is applied for reaction plane resolution @xcite , whereas in a typical modern analysis method , the directed flow correlation is extracted using cumulants @xcite . in general , @xmath0 is of interest when plotted as a function of rapidity , @xmath4 , or sometimes pseudorapidity @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the polar angle of the particle .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on collision centrality and on transverse momentum , @xmath7 , can offer additional insights .    until relatively recently @xcite , the rapidity - even component @xmath8 was always assumed to be zero or negligible in mass - symmetric collisions . in fact , fluctuations within the initial - state colliding nuclei , unrelated to the reaction plane ,",
    "can generate a significant @xmath9 signal @xcite .",
    "this fluctuation effect falls beyond the scope of the present review , which focuses on fluid - like directed flow , @xmath10 , as per eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , and from here on , @xmath0 for mass - symmetric collisions implicitly signifies @xmath11 .    during the first decade of the study of @xmath0 in nuclear collisions ,",
    "it was more commonly called sideward flow .",
    "it refers to a sideward collective motion of the emitted particles , and is a repulsive collective deflection in the reaction plane . by convention , the positive direction of @xmath0",
    "is taken to be the direction of ` bounce - off ' of projectile spectators in a fixed target experiment @xcite .",
    "models imply that directed flow , especially the component closest to beam rapidities , is initiated during the passage time of the two colliding nuclei ; the typical time - scale for this is @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the nuclear radius and lorentz factor , respectively .",
    "this is even earlier than the still - early time when elliptic flow , @xmath15 , is mostly imparted .",
    "thus @xmath0 can probe the very early stages of the collision @xcite , when the deconfined state of quarks and gluons is expected to dominate the collision dynamics  @xcite .",
    "both hydrodynamic  @xcite and transport model @xcite calculations indicate that the directed flow of charged particles , especially baryons at midrapidity , is sensitive to the equation of state and can be used to explore the qcd phase diagram .",
    "the theoretical work leading to the prediction of collective flow in nuclear collisions evolved gradually . in the mid-1950s , belenkij and landau @xcite",
    "were the first to consider a hydrodynamic description of nuclear collisions . during the 1970s , as the bevatron at lawrence berkeley national lab was converted for use as the first accelerator of relativistic nuclear beams , the idea of hydrodynamic shock compression of nuclear matter emerged  @xcite , and these developments in turn led to increasingly realistic predictions @xcite that paved the way for the first unambiguous measurement of directed flow at the bevalac in the mid-1980s @xcite .",
    "a frequent focus of theory papers during the subsequent years was the effort to use directed flow measurements to infer the incompressibility of the nuclear equation of state in the hadron gas phase and to infer properties of the relevant momentum - dependent potential @xcite .",
    "the observed directed flow at ags energies @xcite and below is close to a linear function of rapidity throughout the populated region , and the slope @xmath16 can adequately quantify the strength of the signal . at sps energies and above  @xcite , a more complex structure",
    "is observed in @xmath17 , with the slope @xmath16 in the midrapidity region being different from the slope in the regions closer to beam rapidities .",
    "various models also exhibit this kind of behavior . at these energies , both hydrodynamic and nuclear transport calculations predict a negative sign for charged particle @xmath16 near midrapidity , where pions are the dominant particle species .",
    "this negative @xmath16 near midrapidity has been given various names in the literature : `` third flow component '' @xcite , `` anti - flow '' @xcite , or `` wiggle '' @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been discussed as a possible qgp signature , and a negative @xmath16 for baryons has been argued @xcite to be particularly significant .",
    "however , some aspects of anti - flow can be explained in a model with only hadronic physics @xcite by assuming either incomplete baryon stopping with a positive space - momentum correlation  @xcite , or full stopping with a tilted source  @xcite .",
    "a three - fluid hydrodynamic model  @xcite predicts a monotonic trend in net - baryon directed flow versus beam energy in the case of a purely hadronic equation of state , whereas a prominent minimum at ags energies , dubbed the `` softest point collapse '' , is predicted when the equation of state incorporates a first - order phase transition between hadronic and quark - gluonic matter .",
    "recent measurements of both proton and net - proton directed flow at rhic  @xcite indeed indicate non - monotonic directed flow as a function of beam energy , with the minimum lying between 11.5 and 19.6 gev in @xmath18 .",
    "however , more recent hydrodynamic and nuclear transport calculations which incorporate significant theoretical improvements ( see section [ s - models ] ) do not reproduce the notable qualitative features of the data , and therefore cast doubt on any overall conclusion about the inferred properties of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "directed flow has also been measured at the lhc @xcite .",
    "a negative slope of @xmath19 is observed for charged particles , but its magnitude is much smaller than at rhic , which is thought to be a consequence of the smaller tilt of the participant zone at the lhc .    in this article , we review a representative set of directed flow results spanning ags to lhc energies . in sections",

    "@xmath16 for @xmath64 is closer to zero than @xmath16 for @xmath65 , which supports the inference that @xmath65 and @xmath64 experience nuclear potentials that are repulsive and attractive , respectively , under the conditions created at this beam energy @xcite .",

    "there are two separate contributions to the energy dependence of proton directed flow in the vicinity of midrapidity : one part arises from baryon number transported from the initial state at beam rapidity towards @xmath66 by the stopping process of the collision , while the other part arises from baryon - antibaryon pairs produced in the fireball near midrapidity . clearly , these two contributions have very different dependence on beam energy , and disentangling them has a good potential to generate new insights . towards this end ,",
    "the star collaboration has defined @xcite net - proton directed flow according to @xmath67_p = r(y)[v_{1}(y)]_{\\bar{p } } + [ 1-r(y)]\\,[v_{1}(y)]_{{\\rm net\\mbox{-}}p}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the observed rapidity dependence of the antiproton to proton ratio .",

    "star s measurements of net - proton and net - kaon directed flow slope as a function of beam energy are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ netp_qm15 ]  @xcite .",
    "the net - proton directed flow shows a double sign change , and a clear minimum around the same beam energy where the proton directed flow has its minimum .",
    "this coincidence is not surprising , since antibaryon production is low at and below the beam energy of the minimum , and therefore net - proton and proton observables only begin to deviate from each other at energies above the minimum .",
    "the observed minimum in directed flow for protons and net - protons resemble the predicted `` softest point collapse '' of directed flow @xcite , and these authors are open to an interpretation in terms of a first - order phase transition . other theorists ( see section [ s - models ] ) point out that mechanisms other than a first - order phase transition can cause a drop in pressure ( a softening of the equation of state ) and therefore a definitive conclusion requires more research .    the net - kaon directed flow reproduced in fig .",
    "[ netp_qm15 ]  @xcite shows close agreement with the net - proton result near and above 11.5 gev , but deviates very strongly at 7.7 gev .",
    "this deviation is not understood .",
    "to date , all of the several model comparisons with star @xmath0 measurements at bes energies have considered only particle @xmath0 as opposed to net - particle @xmath0 .     for net protons and net kaons in 10 - 40% centrality au+au collisions , as reported by star @xcite . ]",
    "models that explicitly incorporate properties of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram and its equation of state ( typically hydrodynamic models ) suggest that the magnitude of directed flow is an excellent indicator of the relative pressure during the early , high - density stage of the collision .",
    "therefore , directed flow at sub - ags beam energies can reveal information about hadron gas incompressibility , while at the higher energies that are a focus of the present review , it can flag the softening , or drop in pressure , that may accompany a transition to a different phase , notably quark gluon plasma .",
    "for example , there may be a spinodal decomposition associated with a first - order phase transition @xcite , which would cause a large softening effect .",
    "however , interpretation of flow measurements is not straightforward , and it is known that directed flow can also be sensitive to poorly - understood model inputs like momentum - dependent potentials @xcite in the nuclear medium . more theoretical work is needed to elucidate the quantitative connection between softening signatures , like the beam energy dependence directed flow , and qcd phase changes .",
    "gev @xcite , which should be considered a preliminary measurement .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite is based on a boltzmann transport approach similar to urqmd for the initial and late stages of the collision process , while a hydrodynamic evolution is employed for the intermediate hot and dense stage .",
    "the equation of state for the hydro stage includes crossover and first - order phase transition options . the data comparison by konchakovski _ et al .",
    "@xcite uses the parton - hadron string dynamics ( phsd ) model @xcite of the giessen group , a microscopic approach with a crossover equation of state having properties similar to the crossover of lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "the phsd code also has a mode named hadron string dynamics ( hsd ) , which features purely hadronic physics throughout the collision evolution , and which yields directed flow predictions in close agreement with those @xcite of the urqmd model . the data comparison by ivanov and soldatov @xcite uses a relativistic 3-fluid hydrodynamic model ( 3fd ) @xcite with equations of state that include a crossover option and a first - order phase transition option .",
    "the most recent comparison to the star bes @xmath0 data , by nara _",
    "@xcite , uses the jet aa microscopic ( jam ) model @xcite .",
    "jam is a purely hadronic boltzmann transport code , but the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite introduce an option to switch from the normal stochastic binary scattering style to a modified style where the elementary 2-body scatterings are always oriented like attractive orbits @xcite .",
    "they argue that the switch - over from random to attractive binary orbits mimics the softening effect of a first - order phase transition .",
    "[ model_comparison1 ] focuses on the most promising directed flow measurement from the rhic beam energy scan , namely the @xmath63 for protons at 10 - 40% centrality , and summarizes recent model comparisons @xcite with these data .",
    "these authors are largely in agreement that the data disfavor models with purely hadronic physics .",
    "however , some conclude that a crossover deconfinement transition is favored @xcite , while others conclude that a first - order phase transition is still a possible explanation  @xcite .",
    "note that the argument of nara _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is that a more sophisticated implementation of a first - order phase transition would transition from the ` jam ' curve at low bes energies to the ` jam - attractive ' curve at higher bes energies .",
    "overall , fig .",
    "[ model_comparison1 ] underlines the fact that no option in any of the model calculations to date reproduces , even qualitatively , the most striking feature of the data , namely , the minimum in proton directed flow in the region of @xmath70 gev .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the @xmath0 difference between nominally equivalent equation of state implementations in different models is very large .",
    "for example , the differences in @xmath16 between the 1st - order phase transition in the hybrid model @xcite and a similar nominal quantity for the 3fd model @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ model_comparison2 ] ) is currently more than an order of magnitude larger than the experimental measurement being interpreted , and is larger still than the error on the measured data .",

    "in this review , we discuss heavy ion directed flow results for charged particles and for identified particle types , covering beam energies from the brookhaven ags to the cern lhc .",
    "charged particle directed flow measurements have been published as a function of transverse momentum , pseudorapidity , and collision centrality , while cu+cu and au+au have also been compared .",
    "the charged particle directed flow magnitude at the lhc is a factor of three smaller than that at top rhic energy .",
    "the observations from rhic suggest that the charged particle directed flow is independent of system size , but depends on the incident beam energy . limiting fragmentation scaling",
    "is observed for @xmath0 at rhic energies , but entropy - driven multiplicity scaling in terms of @xmath36 is not seen at rhic . in mass - asymmetric collisions , specifically cu+au , recent directed flow measurements at @xmath71 gev have opened a new window into quark and antiquark formation at the very earliest times of the collision evolution ( @xmath72 fm/@xmath24 ) and could clarify theoretical and experimental questions related to the chiral magnetic effect and the chiral magnetic wave .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 for identified species offer deeper insights into the development of hydrodynamic flow .",
    "opposite @xmath0 for pions and protons at ags / sps and at lower rhic energies suggests an important role for nuclear shadowing .",
    "signals of anti - flow of neutral kaons in ags / e895 together with kaon measurements in the rhic beam energy scan region point to kaon - nucleon potential effects . the single sign - change in proton @xmath0 slope and a double sign - change in net - proton @xmath0 slope , with a clear minimum around @xmath73 11.5 - 19.6 gev shows a qualitative resemblance to a hydrodynamic model prediction called `` softest point collapse of flow '' .",
    "this original prediction assumed a first - order phase transition , but a crossover from hadron gas to a deconfined phase can also cause a softening ( a drop in pressure ) .",
    "none of the current state - of - the - art models can explain the main features of the star directed flow measurements , and different models with nominally similar equations of state diverge from each other very widely over the bes range .",
    "looking ahead to likely developments during the period 2017 - 2018 in the area of directed flow at @xmath18 of a few gev and above , we can expect new bes phase - i results for the @xmath3 meson , as well as final publication of current preliminary rhic beam energy scan phase - i results , like those in ref .",
    ". we can also expect parallel theoretical work on related physics and interpretation of the newest data .",
    "the preliminary results for new particle species like @xmath48s and charged and neutral kaons , as well as bes @xmath0 for protons , @xmath48s and pions in narrow bins of centrality ( nine bins spanning 0 - 80% centrality ) amount to very stringent constraints on the next round of theoretical interpretation in terms of the qcd phase diagram and equation of state .",
    "more comprehensive measurements of the many phenomenological aspects of directed flow outlined in this review will be possible beginning in the year 2019 , as a consequence of the much increased statistics of phase - ii of the rhic beam energy scan ( to take data in 2019 and 2020 ) , in conjunction with the anticipated upgrades to the performance of the star detector @xcite . thereafter ,",
    "new facilities like fair @xcite in germany , nica @xcite in russia , and j - parc - hi  @xcite in japan , will begin coming online .",
    "these new dedicated facilities will further strengthen worldwide research on the qcd phase diagram at high baryon chemical potential .",
