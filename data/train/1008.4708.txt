    "the theory of lyapunov exponents of hard - ball systems has a long history .",
    "it started with the pioneering work of krylov @xcite , was rigorously developed by sinai @xcite and collaborators , and completed ( to some extent ) by van beijeren , dorfman and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the analytical calculation of , e.g. , the largest lyapunov exponent of a dilute rigid - sphere gas , is based on the fact that the dynamics consists of free rectilinear motions interrupted by instantaneous elastic collisions @xcite ; the expressions so - obtained agree quantitatively with the numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "the case of a dilute gas with finite - range interactions can be handled in close analogy with the rigid - sphere problem : though the collisions are not trivial any more , the dynamics is still ruled by occasional pairwise encounters @xcite .",
    "however , when one considers long - range interactions ( or short - range interactions and high densities ) , the theoretical approach must be substantially modified .",
    "in the general case we must deal with the full system of coupled differential equations that govern the evolution of multidimensional tangent vectors @xmath2 .",
    "consider for instance a gas of @xmath3 particles in three dimensions described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are conjugate position - momentum coordinates . assuming @xmath7 , tangent vectors evolve according to @xmath8 ( dot meaning time derivative ) , where @xmath9 is the hessian matrix of the potential @xmath10 , namely @xmath11 the hessian depends explicitly on time because it is calculated along a reference trajectory @xmath12 .",
    "once initial conditions @xmath13 and @xmath14 have been specified , one can find @xmath2 from eq .",
    "( [ tangent ] ) .",
    "then the lyapunov exponent @xmath0 is obtained by calculating the limit @xcite @xmath15 assuming ergodicity on the energy - shell , @xmath0 becomes independent of initial conditions @xmath16 , which can then be chosen randomly according to the microcanonical distribution .",
    "there will also be no dependence on initial tangent vectors , because if @xmath14 is also chosen randomly , it will have a non - zero component along the most expanding direction .",
    "it is this average over @xmath16 and @xmath14 that permits to treat equations ( [ tangent ] ) formally as a system of stochastic differential equations @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the dynamics can be thought of as free motion plus weak interactions , then perturbative techniques , like the cumulant expansion @xcite , can be invoked .",
    "so , the theory attempts to calculate the average @xmath17 however , in practice , it is much simpler to develop an estimate for the generalized lyapunov exponent @xcite @xmath18 this is essentially the approach followed by barnett et al @xcite , pettini et al @xcite , and the present authors @xcite . in situations of weak intermittency both exponents are expected to be close . if one wishes to use a theoretically calculated @xmath1 as an approximation to @xmath0 , then a numerical check must be done first to verify that both exponents coincide . the cumulant expansion to be discussed below offers an analytical expression for @xmath0 via the replica trick .",
    "note , however , that the difficulties involved in such a calculation are much greater than those we shall face when dealing with @xmath1 .",
    "though there are some differences among the formulations of the three just - mentioned groups , it may be said that the main theoretical conclusion extracted from that body of work is : if one combines the cumulant expansion with some kind of isotropy approximation ( which may be fully justified in some cases ) , the original problem of @xmath19 differential equations can be reduced to a system of only two equations for a  representative \" single degree of freedom : @xmath20 in this kind of mean - field approximation , the  curvature \" @xmath21 is a scalar stochastic process , whose cumulants can be related to the ( operator ) cumulants of the hessian @xmath22 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the comparison of theoretical results obtained with the cumulant approach versus numerical simulations has met mixed success .",
    "the agreement is very good for a many - particle system with bounded weak interactions @xcite and for the fermi - pasta - ulam system @xcite .",
    "however , the results for the 1d - xy model @xcite , for a dense one - component plasma @xcite , and for a dilute lennard - jones gas @xcite are not so satisfactory .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the limits of validity of the cumulant approach for the lyapunov exponent of a many particle system .",
    "we choose as a starting point the simplified mean - field setting ( [ tangent2 ] ) and consider two possibilities for @xmath21 .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that , for typical chaotic many - body systems , @xmath21 should be close to gaussian white noise ; this is the first case we shall consider . in the white - noise case",
    "the second - order expansion for @xmath1 is exact , thus this case is ideally suited for analyzing the difficulties that appear in the _ numerical _ calculation of @xmath1 .",
    "next , we keep the gaussian and markov properties but allow for finite correlation times , leading to the ornstein - uhlenbeck process ; in this case we calculate the fourth cumulant contribution to @xmath1 .",
    "though it will not be considered here , we also mention the interesting situation of @xmath21 being a poisson process , which appears to be the appropriate choice for modeling the tangent - vector dynamics in a dilute gas with short - range interactions .",
    "formally , eq .  ( [ tangent2 ] ) describes a harmonic oscillator with a random frequency @xmath23 such that @xmath24 ( kubo oscillator ) .",
    "it is worth generalizing this model a bit to account for the possibility of damping , i.e. , we shall consider an oscillator described by the dynamical equation @xmath25 setting @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , recovers ( [ tangent2 ] ) .    some analytical results for the lyapunov exponent of the kubo oscillator ( [ kuboosc ] ) can be found in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here we shall restrict ourselves to the analytical calculation of the generalized exponent @xmath1 .",
    "for this purpose we must consider the dynamics of second moments : @xmath29 let us think that , in principle , both parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 are stationary stochastic processes . if fluctuations are small enough ( in a sense that will be discussed later ) , one can obtain the average of the second - moment vector using the first terms of the cumulant expansion , which works as follows @xcite .",
    "first we split the stochastic matrix as an average plus fluctuations : @xmath32 for long times one has : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the @xmath35 matrix given by the operator cumulant expansion @xcite @xmath36 dots stand for third and higher cumulants ( some explicit expressions can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath1 is related to the eigenvalue of @xmath34 that has the largest real part : @xmath37 with @xmath38 the eigenvalues of @xmath39 .",
    "when the entries of the fluctuation matrix @xmath40 are gaussian white noise ( and only in this case @xcite ) the cumulant expansion stops at the second order , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ cum ] ) is exact ( without the ellipsis ) .",
    "this is the case we consider now .",
    "let us first study the situation where the damping @xmath30 is a constant and @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a zero - mean gaussian white noise .",
    "its correlation function reads @xmath43 with these definitions one has @xmath44 after substitution into eq .",
    "( [ cum ] ) we readily obtain @xmath45 the generalized exponent @xmath1 can now be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ lambdastar ] ) . a closed expression for the standard lyapunov exponent can be found in the literature @xcite . as an example , fig .",

    "we preferred to consider intermittent cases , because it is in these regimes that the numerical difficulties arise , as we discuss in the following section .",
    "we remark that there are situations of interest where both exponents practically coincide , e.g. , for a dilute lennard - jones gas @xcite . in such cases",

    ", one must calculate the squared - norm averaged over several realizations at a given large time .",
    "however , we must keep in mind that such an average is dominated by the extreme positive values of the local exponent @xmath59 .",
