    "the discovery of the long - sought neutrino mixing parameter @xmath6 in the short - baseline disappearance reactor neutrino oscillation experiments , double chooz , reno and daya bay @xcite has completed the list of the unknown mixing parameters of the neutrino oscillation theory .",
    "the goals of the ongoing series of medium - baseline reactor neutrino disappearance experiments , juno and reno50 @xcite , and the long - baseline accelerator neutrino appearance experiments , nova and dune @xcite , as well as future neutrino factory experiments @xcite are to measure the leptonic cp - violating phase , the only yet unknown parameter of the theory , which is highly favored for the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe , to determine the correct ordering of the neutrino masses , normal or inverted , and to achieve high precision in the standard mixing parameters and the magnitudes of the mass - squared differences .",
    "the solar neutrino experiment , borexino , has recently yielded for the first time the real - time measurement of the low - energy pp neutrinos @xcite which , although not very precise , are a milestone for the solar neutrino flux .",
    "concurrently , lena is underway to give a high - precision measurement of the mixing parameters @xcite .",
    "the short - baseline accelerator neutrino- and reactor antineutrino - electron elastic scattering experiments @xcite have played a key role in confirming the gauge structure of standard model , in precisely testing the electroweak mixing parameter@xmath7 @xmath8  @xcite and constraining the nonstandard physics parameters davidson , forero , jb1,jb2,jb3 , ank2,isodar , texono2 .",
    "though these experiments are very challenging because of the tiny sizes of cross sections , they are perfect probes of the precise determination of the @xmath9  and the nonstandard physics because no complications due to the hadronic structure are involved .",
    "these experiments are also explored for hints on neutrino magnetic moments @xcite , searches for unparticles @xcite , neutrino @xmath10couplings @xcite , the large mass - squared difference case due to the sterile neutrinos sterile ( @xmath111ev@xmath12 ) and the nonstandard neutrino interactions ( nsis ) .    the currently running precision neutrino oscillation and neutrino and antineutrino - electron elastic scattering experiments can be used as perfect probes for the new physics due to the lepton universality violation and the lepton flavor violation . in the neutrino oscillation experiments , nonuniversal ( nu ) and flavor - changing ( fc ) nsis",
    "are studied in combination with the neutrino oscillations at the neutrino source , propagation and at the detector @xcite . on the other hand , in the short - baseline neutrino and antineutrino - electron scattering experiments",
    ", these nsis can be studied without the interference of neutrino oscillations because their baselines and energies result in small l / e@xmath13 ratios and one can safely ignore the oscillation effects .",
    "another important aspect of the nsi study in the short - baseline experiments is that their measurements are independent of the energy resolution of the detector because the neutrino beam dispersion is negligibly small and there are no degeneracies between nsis and the energy uncertainties of the beam @xcite . as has been checked in refs .",
    "@xcite there are no effects of the energy resolution on the size of neutrino cross sections in these experiments , so we ignore the detector energy resolution effects for all the reactor neutrino cross sections included in this study .",
    "we use the formalism developed in ref . @xcite and extend the analysis of reference @xcite , where only nu nsis were considered , to find the global fits on all the possible nsi parameters ( nu and fc ) at source and detector and their interplays as we did in ref .",
    "@xcite only for the case of texono experiment . the striking feature of the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite is that it connects the physics at the source and at the detector .",
    "this enables one to explore the semileptonic nsis at the source using the recoiled electron data of @xmath14  and @xmath15scattering processes .",
    "the combination of the @xmath14  scattering data and @xmath15scattering data can significantly improve the detector nsi parameter bounds as the @xmath14  scattering data are sensitive to the left - handed ( lh ) couplings , whereas the @xmath16  scatterings are sensitive to the right - handed ( rh ) couplings .",
    "we focus on the leading order neutrino- and antineutrino interaction processes , calculate their cross sections in the form appropriate for these experiments and then fit the global data from these experiments with all the unknown nsi parameters relevant for the @xmath14  and  @xmath15scatterings . _ _  _ _ this analysis is based on the combined data of accelerator - based neutrino sources in the energy range ( 7 - 50 )  mevand the reactor neutrino sources in the energy range of ( 3 - 8 ) mev in the respective leptonic scattering processes . _  _    in the following section , we review the formalism being used in this analysis .",
    "we then turn to the global fitting analysis for the standard model parameter , @xmath8  in sec .",
    "ii using the combined data of the eight scattering experiments . in sec .",
    "iii , we find the global fits on nsi parameters only at the sources , using the recoiled electron energy data ; we call them the source - only parameters . in sec .",
    "iv , we turn to the global fitting analysis of the nsi parameters only at the neutrino detectors and them the detector - only parameters , using the recoiled energy spectrum at the detector . in sec .",
    "v , we find the interplay between the source - only and the detector - only nsi parameters using the global data . in sec .",
    "vi , we conclude and summarize .",
    "for the setup under consideration , the sources of neutrinos are the charged - current ( cc ) pion decays at the accelerators and , for antineutrinos , are the cc neutron beta decays at the reactors , while the target particles at the detectors are electrons and the contributions for the @xmath17 scatterings come from both the cc and neutral currents ( nc ) .",
    "therefore , the effective four - fermion lh lagrangians governing the cc semileptonic decays at both the accelerators and reactors @xcite and the lh and rh effective four - fermion lagrangians for the leptonic @xmath18 scattering processes @xcite at the detector are , respectively , given as        where@xmath21the superscripts _ s _  and @xmath22  designate semileptonic and leptonic and the subscripts nu  and fc  correspond to the nonuniversal and flavor - changing nsis for both the cases , respectively . here",
    "`` @xmath23 '' and `` @xmath24 ''  are the flavor - basis indices and `` @xmath25 '' is the mass - basis index which can be eliminated by the effective replacement of u@xmath26  in eq . ( 3 ) and @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( 4)@xmath7  because oscillations play no role due to the small l / e@xmath13 ratio for these experiments .    for simplicity , we consider only the lh effective lagrangian at the sources and ignore the rh part because we do not consider any rh interactions of neutrinos in this study .",
    "the complex coefficients @xmath28  represent the relative coupling strengths of the flavor combinations in the presence of new physics at accelerator or reactor sources , and the complex coefficients @xmath29represent the relative coupling strengths of the flavor combinations in the presence of new physics at detector to sm , while in the sm case both @xmath30and @xmath31the hermiticity of the leptonic effective lagrangian@xmath7 @xmath32  requires that the detector nsi parameters matrix is hermitian and therefore , @xmath33 , so the nu nsi parameters at the detectors are real , but the fc nsi parameters are complex in general . with the effective lagrangians defined , we are now ready to summarize the cross sections and flux factors needed for quantifying the nsi effects at the source and detector .
