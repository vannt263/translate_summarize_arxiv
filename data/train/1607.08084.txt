    "local effective field theories have also been applied to systems with deeply inelastic reactions that produce particles with momenta too large to be described accurately within the effective field theory .",
    "for example , a deeply inelastic three - body recombination event produces a molecule and an atom whose momenta may be outside the domain of validity of the effective theory .",
    "the large energy release from the inelastic reaction comes from the conversion of rest energy into kinetic energy .",
    "the standard argument for the locality of the effective field theory does not apply .",
    "the particles with large momenta produced by the inelastic reaction can propagate over arbitrarily long distances , so their effects on low - energy particles are not obviously restricted to short distances .",
