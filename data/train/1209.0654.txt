    "optical deflectometric tomography ( odt ) is an imaging modality that aims at reconstructing the spatial distribution of the refractive index of a transparent object from the deviation of the light passing through the object . by reconstructing the refractive index map ( rim )",
    "we are able to optically characterize transparent materials like optical fibers or multifocal intra - ocular lenses ( iol ) , which is of great importance in manufacture and control processes .",
    "odt is attractive for its high sensitivity and effective detection of local details and object contours .",
    "the technique is insensitive to vibrations and it does not require coherent light . compared to interferometry , odt can be applied to objects with higher refractive index difference with respect to the surrounding solution .",
    "the deflectometer used for the data acquisition is based on the phase - shifting schlieren method  @xcite . for each orientation of the sample , two - dimensional  ( 2-d ) mappings of local light deviations are measured .",
    "as these light deviations are proportional to the transverse gradient of the rim integrated along the light ray , odt is able to reconstruct the rim from the angle measurements .",
    "first works on deflectometric tomography  @xcite have focused on the use of common reconstruction techniques like the filtered back projection ( fbp ) .",
    "they have proved that fbp provides an accurate estimation of the rim when sufficient amount of object orientations is available . however ,",
    "when we consider a scenario with a limited number of light incident angles , and in the presence of noise in odt observations , fbp induces the apparition of spurious artifacts in the estimated rim , lowering the reconstruction quality .    inspired by",
    "the compressed sensing ( cs ) paradigm  @xcite , which demonstrates that few measurements are enough for an accurate reconstruction of low complexity ( _ e.g. _ , sparse ) signals , recent works in odt have started to exploit sparsity to reconstruct the rim from few acquisitions , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the presence of an ill - posed inverse problem .",
    "foumouo et al .",
    "@xcite and antoine et al .",
    "@xcite have used a sparse representation in a b - splines basis and regularized the problem using the @xmath1-norm .",
    "the reconstruction was performed using iterative schemes and the results show that , although the method is capable of reproducing the shape of spatially localized objets , the image dynamics is not well preserved and the borders are smoothened .    although sparsity based methods are new in odt , they have been used in other applications , such as magnetic resonance imaging ( mri )  @xcite , absorption tomography ( at )  @xcite , radio interferometry  @xcite and phase - contrast tomography  @xcite , for image reconstruction under partial observation models .",
    "more details are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : state - of - the - art ] .",
    "an additional problem that rises in all physical applications is the estimation of the sensing operator that fits better the physical acquisition .",
    "most operators present a non ideal behavior , which conditions the numerical methods to solve the inverse problem . in tomographic problems ,",
    "this operator requires to map spatial data in a cartesian grid to fourier data in a polar grid .",
    "previous works have used _ gridding _ techniques to interpolate data from a polar to a cartesian or pseudo polar grid before applying the fourier transform  @xcite .",
    "however , the error introduced when using these techniques is not bounded and introduces an uncontrolled distortion .      in this work , we show that the odt can be made both compressive and robust to gaussian noise . in the context of a simplified 2-d sensing model",
    ", we propose a constrained method based on the minimization of the total - variation ( tv ) norm that provides high quality reconstruction results even when few acquisitions are available and in the presence of high level of gaussian noise .",
    "this is motivated by assuming the rim composed of slowly varying areas separated by sharp transitions corresponding to material interfaces .",
    "such a behavior is known to be represented by spatial functions having _ bounded variations _ ( small tv norm ) , such as those following a cartoon - shape model .",
    "this also distinguishes our work from two previous studies focused on continuous rim decomposition with a b - splines basis .",
    "deflection integrals were there estimated in the spatial domain using complex numerical methods leading to a smoother rim estimation @xcite .    to account for the noise and the raw data consistency , we add an @xmath2 data fidelity term adapted to gaussian and uniformly distributed noise .",
    "moreover , the proposed method offers the flexibility to work with more than one constraint .",
    "in contrast with  @xcite , we add here two more constraints based on general prior information on the rim in order to converge to an optimal solution : _",
    "( i ) _ the rim is positive everywhere and _",
    "( ii ) _ the object is completely contained in the experimental field of view .",
    "these extra constraints provably guarantee the unicity of the odt solution .    as for the operator",
    ", we use the nfft algorithm , a fast computation of the non - equispaced dft .",
    "this algorithm provides an efficient estimation of the polar fourier transform with a controlled distortion regarding the true polar transform .",
    "the compressive odt problem is solved by means of the primal - dual algorithm proposed by chambolle et al .",
    "@xcite , complemented by an adaptive choice of its parameters improving the global convergence speed , as proposed in a recent work of goldstein et al . @xcite .",
    "the results are compared with a minimum energy ( me ) method and a common fbp approach , showing clear gain compared to these two approaches in terms of compressiveness , noise robustness and reconstruction quality .      in sec .",

    "* section  3.2 , p.  56 ) , there exists a deflectometric fourier slice theorem ( dfst ) that relates the 1-d ( radial ) fourier transform of the deflection angle along the _ affine parameter _",
    "@xmath86 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath87 to the 2-d fourier transform of the rim .",

    "hereafter , the value @xmath90 is called _",
    "affine frequency_.    we may remark from ( [ eq : measures ] ) that there are different ways to cover the 2-d frequency plane with deflectometric measurements .",
    "this can be observed from the following symmetry relations for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 :    @xmath94    where the two first relations come from the change @xmath95 in ( [ eq : deflectionangle ] ) and ( [ eq : measures ] ) , and the last equation is due to the fourier conjugate symmetry of real spatial functions .    in particular , from the symmetry ( [ eq : od - eqsym-3 ] ) , we can restrict @xmath90 to positive values by taking @xmath96 in the whole circle @xmath97 . or alternatively , from ( [ eq : od - eqsym-2 ] ) and ( [ eq : od - eqsym-3 ] ) , we can deduce @xmath98 and restrict @xmath96 to the half circle @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",

    "[ sec : reconstruction ] , this implies that the rim can only be estimated relatively to the known reference rim  @xmath83 .",
    "let us conclude by insisting on the impact of the equivalence . similarly to the use of the fourier slice theorem in common ( absorption ) tomography , is of great importance for defining a discrete odt sensing model which can be computed efficiently in the fourier domain given a discretized refractive index map @xmath55 .",

    "in order to reconstruct efficiently the rim from odt measurements , recorded data must be treated appropriately considering , jointly , the data discretization , the polar geometry of the odt sensing and unavoidable measurement noises .",
    "we present here the discrete formulation of the odt sensing and the construction of the forward model from the recorded data .",

    "moreover , the value @xmath125 and the resolution @xmath123 are also related to the fov @xmath50 so that @xmath129 . since there is no reason to ask more resolution to the sampling @xmath130 than the available in the affine variations of the odt measurements , we will work with @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "third , in this discretized setting , the affine frequency @xmath90 in ( [ eq : measures ] ) must also be sampled with @xmath133 values . as described in the next section , this comes from the replacement of the ( radial ) fourier transform in ( [ eq : radial - fourier - deflecto ] ) by its discrete counterpart .",
    "this leads to a ( signed ) frequency polar grid of same size @xmath134 with @xmath135 . as it will become clearer in the following , only half of this polar grid will be necessary to bring independent observations of the rim , _ i.e. _ , we will often work on @xmath136 with @xmath137 .      from the discrete domains defined above , the continuous rim @xmath55 observed in the experimental fov is discretized into a set of @xmath138 values @xmath139 from the coordinates @xmath140",

    "<S> optical deflectometric tomography ( odt ) provides an accurate characterization of transparent materials whose complex surfaces present a real challenge for manufacture and control . in odt , the refractive index map ( rim ) of a transparent object is reconstructed by measuring light deflection under multiple orientations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this imaging modality can be made _ compressive _ , _ i.e. _ , a correct rim reconstruction is achievable with far less observations than required by traditional minimum energy ( me ) or filtered back projection ( fbp ) methods . assuming a cartoon - shape rim model , this reconstruction is driven by minimizing the map total - variation under a fidelity constraint with the available observations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , two other realistic assumptions are added to improve the stability of our approach : the map positivity and a frontier condition . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , our method relies on an accurate odt sensing model and on a primal - dual minimization scheme , including easily the sensing operator and the proposed rim constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude this paper by demonstrating the power of our method on synthetic and experimental data under various compressive scenarios . in particular , the potential compressiveness of the stabilized odt problem is demonstrated by observing a typical gain of 24db compared to me and of 30db compared to fbp at only 5% of 360 incident light angles for moderately noisy sensing .    </S>",
