    "in high - energy processes the quark - gluon structure of the nucleon is described by a set of parton distributions . at the level of leading twist a complete quark - parton model of the nucleon",
    "requires three quark distributions , i.e. the quark density , or unpolarized distribution , @xmath0 , the longitudinal polarization , or helicity , distribution , @xmath1 , and the transverse polarization , or transversity , distribution , @xmath2 .",
    "the first two distributions are well known quantities and can be extracted from inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) data .",
    "the last one is totally unknown because , being a chiral - odd quantity , does not contribute to inclusive dis and is only accessible experimentally when coupled to another chiral - odd partner in the cross section .    theoretically , these quark distributions are the forward limit of so - called generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) defined as non - diagonal hadronic matrix elements of bilocal products of the light - front quark and gluon field operators .",
    "they depend on the momentum transferred to the parton , as well as on the average longitudinal momentum . a complete set of quark gpds at leading twist include four helicity conserving , usually labeled @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and four helicity flipping ( chiral - odd ) gpds , labeled @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10  @xcite . in the forward limit , as the momentum transfer vanish , @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 reduce to @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "a variety of model calculations is available for the helicity conserving gpds  @xcite .",
    "less attention has been paid up to now to the chiral - odd case . up to now",
    ", there is only one proposal to access the chiral - odd gpds in diffractive double meson production  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "the chiral - odd gpds are studied in the overlap representation of light - cone wave functions ( lcwfs ) that was originally proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite within the framework of light - cone quantization . in a fully covariant approach",
    "the connection between the overlap representation of gpds and the non - diagonal one - body density matrix in momentum space has further been explored in ref .",
    "@xcite making use of the correct transformation of the wave functions from the ( canonical ) instant - form to the ( light - cone ) front - form description . in this way",
    "the lowest - order fock - space components of lcwfs with three valence quarks are directly linked to wave functions derived in constituent quark models ( cqms ) .",
    "results for the four helicity conserving gpds have been obtained  @xcite , automatically fulfilling the support condition and the particle number and momentum sum rules .",
    "this approach has been extended to include the next - order fock state component , by developing a convolution formalism for the unpolarized gpds which incorporatae the quark sea contribution  @xcite .",
    "important dynamical effects are introduced by the correct relativistic treatment ; as a consequence , e.g. , a nonzero anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon is obtained even when all the valence quarks are accommodated in the @xmath14-wave . an effective angular momentum , as required by the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite , is introduced by the boost from the rest frame to the light - front frame producing a nonvanishing unpolarized nonsinglet ( helicity - flip ) quark distribution .    in this paper , following the approach discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , chiral - odd gpds are derived using the fock - state decomposition in the transverse - spin basis and lcwfs with three valence quarks .",
    "numerical results are presented including the forward limit , i.e. transversity , and its first moment , i.e. the tensor charge .",
    "the chiral - odd gpds are off - diagonal in the parton helicity basis . working in the reference frame where the momenta @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the initial and final nucleon lie in the @xmath17 plane",
    ", they become diagonal if one changes basis from eigenstates of helicity to eigenstates of transversity , i.e. states with spin projection @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) directed along ( opposite to ) the transverse direction @xmath20 . in such a basis",
    "they are obtained by means of the following relations @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the invariant momentum square , @xmath23 is its minimum value for a given value of the skewness parameter @xmath24 defined in terms of the momentum transfer @xmath25 and the average nucleon momentum @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the @xmath29-component of @xmath30 .",
    "the transverse matrix elements are defined as follows @xmath31 of plus - momentum fractions , where the generalized quark distributions describe the emission of a quark with plus - momentum @xmath32 and its reabsorption with plus - momentum @xmath33 , they can be written in the overlap representation of lcwfs as @xmath34_n[d^2\\vec{k}_\\perp]_n\\delta(\\bar{x } - \\bar{x}_j)\\mathit{\\psi}^{*}_{\\lambda'_t , n,\\beta'}(\\hat{r } ' ) \\mathit{\\psi}_{\\lambda_t , n,\\beta}(\\tilde{r } ) , \\label{eq : tuno}\\\\ & & \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : ttilde_ov } \\tilde{t}^{q } _ { \\lambda'_t\\lambda_t } & = & \\sum_{\\beta,\\beta',n } \\bigg(\\sqrt{1 - \\xi}\\bigg)^{2 - n}\\bigg(\\sqrt{1 + \\xi}\\bigg)^{2 - n } \\sum_{j=1}^n\\delta_{{\\mu_j^t}'-\\mu_j^t}\\delta_{{\\mu_i^t}'\\mu_i^t}\\mathrm{sign}(\\mu_{j}^{t } ) \\delta_{s_jq}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\int[d\\bar{x}]_n[d^2\\vec{k}_\\perp]_n\\delta(\\bar{x } - \\bar{x}_j)\\mathit{\\psi}^{*}_{\\lambda'_t , n,\\beta'}(\\hat{r } ' ) \\mathit{\\psi}_{\\lambda_t , n,\\beta}(\\tilde{r } ) , \\label{eq : tdue}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the momentum lcwf of the @xmath36-parton fock state , @xmath37 labels the quantum numbers of the @xmath38-th active parton , with transverse initial ( final ) spin polarization @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , and @xmath41 are the transverse spin of the spectator initial ( final ) quarks .",
    "the set of kinematical variables @xmath42 are defined according to refs .",
    "the integration measures in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tuno ] ) and ( [ eq : tdue ] ) are defined as _",
    "n = _ i=1^n dx_i ( 1-_i=1^n x_i ) ,   [ d^2 k_]_n = _ i=1^n^2(_i=1^nk_,i - p _ ) d^2k_i .",
    "as an application of the general formalism reviewed in the previous sections we consider the valence - quark contribution ( @xmath43 ) to the chiral - odd gpds calculated starting from an instant - form su(6 ) symmetric wave function of the proton derived in the relativistic quark model of ref .",
    "the structure of the nucleon wave function in this model is su(6 ) symmetric for the spin - isospin components .",
    "in such a model , e.g. , from the forward limit of the chiral - even gpds the anomalous magnetic moments for the @xmath44 and @xmath45 quarks are @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , corresponding to fairly good proton and neutron anomalous magnetic momenta @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    as an example",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] the four calculated chiral - odd gpds , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 at @xmath54 ( gev)@xmath55 and for different values of @xmath56 . in all cases",
    "the gpds vanish at @xmath57 since in our approach they include the contribution of valence quarks only and we can not populate the so - called erbl region with @xmath58 where quark - antiquark pairs and gluons are important . therefore , at low @xmath59 this gives a strong @xmath56 dependence of the peak position of the distribution , but for large @xmath59 the @xmath56 dependence turns out to be rather weak .",
    "concerning the @xmath60 dependence , it affects the low-@xmath59 region and is more pronounced in the cases of @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for large @xmath59 values the decay of all the distributions towards zero at the",
    "boundary @xmath61 is almost independent of @xmath60 ( see ref .",
    "in the forward limit @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , with @xmath29 being the usual bjorken variable ) , only the quark gpds @xmath64 can be measured and , in fact , becomes the quark transversity distributions @xmath65 .",
    "although the quark gpds @xmath66 and @xmath67 do not contribute to the scattering amplitude , they remain finite in the forward limit , whereas @xmath68 vanishes identically being an odd function of @xmath56 as already noticed  @xcite .",
    "the transversity distribution @xmath69 is the counterpart in the transverse - polarization space of the helicity parton distribution @xmath70 which measures the helicity asymmetry . as it was stressed by jaffe and ji  @xcite , in nonrelativistic situations where rotational and boost operations commute , one has @xmath71 .",
    "therefore the difference between @xmath69 and @xmath70 is a measure of the relativistic nature of the quarks inside the nucleon . in light - cone cqms",
    "these relativistic effects are encoded in the melosh rotations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] the helicity and transversity distributions , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , obtained as a forward limit of the corresponding gpds calculated with the cqm of ref .",
    "@xcite are compared and plotted together with the nonrelativistic result when melosh rotations reduce to identity .",
    "the large difference between @xmath12 and @xmath13 shows how big is the effect of relativity .",
    "recalling the expression for the unpolarized parton distribution @xmath72 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is easy to see that the following relations hold @xmath73 which are compatible with the soffer inequality  @xcite . in the nonrelativistic limit one obtains @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    "we note that the relations ( [ eq : soffer ] ) generalize to the case of parton distributions the results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite for the axial ( @xmath76 ) and tensor ( @xmath77 ) charges , defined as @xmath78 respectively .",
    "the tensor ( axial ) charge measures the net number of transversely ( longitudinally ) polarized valence quarks in a transversely ( longitudinally ) polarized nucleon .",
    "as shown in table  [ table : tab1 ] the up - quark contribution dominates in a transversely polarized proton .",
    "however , the obtained numbers are closer to those derived in the nonrelativistic approach than those predicted by qcd sum rules  @xcite ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 at the scale of the nucleon mass ) , with a nonnegligible negative contribution of the down quark .",
    "when evolved in leading - order qcd from the intrinsic scale of the model ( @xmath81 gev@xmath55 ) to @xmath82 gev@xmath55 the tensor charges become @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the cqm of ref .",
    "@xcite , within the range of values calculated in the different models considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and in fair agreement with lattice qcd calculations  @xcite .",
    ".valence contributions to the axial and tensor charge calculated within different su(6)-symmetric quark models : the nonrelativistic quark model ( nr ) , the harmonic oscillator model ( ho ) of ref .  @xcite , and the cqm model of ref .  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      another quantity related to the forward limit of chiral - odd gpds is the angular momentum @xmath85 carried by quarks with transverse polarization in the @xmath20 direction in an unpolarized nucleon at rest .",
    "this quantity has recently been shown  @xcite to be one half of the expectation value of the transversity asymmetry , i.e. ^x j^x_q= j^x_q,+x - j^x_q ,- x= , where the invariant form factors @xmath86 @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the second moments of the chiral - odd gpds @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "using lcwfs derived from the relativistic cqm of ref .",
    "@xcite we obtain ^x j^x_u=0.54 , ^x j^x_d=0.37 , while using the simple harmonic oscillator wave function of the nucleon as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain ^x j^x_u=0.68 , ^x j^x_d=0.28 .",
    "the same also occurs for the forward matrix element of @xmath89 , i.e. ^q_t dx .",
    "[ eq : kappat ] the quantity @xmath90 describes how far and in which direction the average position of quarks with spin in the @xmath20 direction is shifted in the @xmath91 direction in an unpolarized nucleon  @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath90 governs the transverse spin - flavor dipole moment in an unpolarized nucleon and plays a role similar to the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath92 for the unpolarized quark distributions in a transversely polarized nucleon . as a matter of fact",
    ", we obtain      apart from their magnitude , the same sign of @xmath90 is predicted in both models .",
    "this may have an impact on the boer - mulders function @xmath93 describing the asymmetry of the transverse momentum of quarks perpendicular to the quark spin in an unpolarized nucleon  @xcite . since for @xmath94 we expect that quarks polarized in the @xmath91 direction should preferentially be deflected in the @xmath20 direction , in accordance with the trento convention  @xcite @xmath95 would imply @xmath96  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , keeping in mind the magnitude of the quark anomalous magnetic moments @xmath92 derived with relativistic cqm of ref .",
    "@xcite , the average boer - mulders function is predicted here larger than the average sivers function  @xcite , @xmath97 , describing the transverse momentum asymmetry of unpolarized quarks in a transversely polarized target .",
