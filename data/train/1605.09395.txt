    "joint electromagnetic  ( em ) and gravitational - wave  ( gw ) observations of compact object mergers could allow for unprecedented measurements of astrophysical processes in strongly - curved spacetimes .",
    "such observations are possible thanks to a suite of advanced gw detectors and multi - wavelength wide - field surveys that recently came online last year .",
    "a hundred years after einstein s initial prediction of gws , the first observations of gws from binary black hole mergers were measured simultaneously by the two ligo detectors on september 14th  2015  @xcite and december 26th  2016 .",
    "these first detections mark a new era of transient - gw astronomy ( see  @xcite for an overview and references therein ) . aside from binary black holes , the other most numerous sources predicted for kilohertz gw detectors , such as ligo @xcite and virgo @xcite , are the mergers of double neutron star ( dns ) and black hole - neutron star ( bh - ns ) systems @xcite . through their dimensionless wavestrain @xmath7 ,",
    "gws encode key information about the progenitors physical and geometric properties that probe the sources bulk dynamic properties .",
    "these complicated mergers should also produce em signatures from energetic matter outflows at different timescales .",
    "gw - em detections will increase our confidence in detections of the gw signal and are essential for the identification of the hosts and measuring their distances  @xcite .",
    "additionally , em counterparts of mergers inform us about the environment , and the matters thermodynamic and composition properties .",
    "we require both em and gw measurements to fully understand neutron star binary mergers . in this paper",
    ", we focus on how to observe both gw and late radio emissions from neutron star binary mergers .    based on population synthesis models calibrated by observed galactic dns systems , advanced versions of gw detectors operating at their design sensitivity , such as ligo , virgo and kagra , expect to detect from 0.4 to 400 ( with a mean value of 40 ) dns mergers per year out to several hundred mpc @xcite .",
    "such an expected rate is consistent with the observed short-@xmath0 ray burst ( sgrb ) rate assuming a half - opening beaming angle of @xmath8 @xcite and solar system abundance patterns of @xmath9-process elements @xcite .",
    "based entirely on population synthesis models as we have yet to observe a bh - ns system , we expect to detect 0.2 to 200 bh - ns systems per year with detectable distances @xmath10 gpc .    for em follow - up observations of compact object binary mergers ,",
    "a fundamental challenge is the poor sky resolution of a single gw interferometer .",
    "localizing a transient source on the sky depends primarily on triangulating the gw signal s arrival times using networks of three or more gw detectors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we must anticipate gw errors that span from 0.5 to 100s square degrees sometimes with multimodal islands ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the wide range depends on the sources signal - to - noise ratio , their sky position , the number of detectors in the network and whether they are being used coherently . by exploiting the detectors quadrupolar antenna functions",
    ", two or more gw detectors can also localize events from several hundreds to a thousand square degrees within arcs of the sky @xcite .",
    "therefore em observatories must be prepared for triggers from gw detectors that span these huge swaths of the sky of several hundred degrees released within minutes to thirty minutes of the merger being detected in gws ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    at present several em counterparts of dns and bh - ns mergers",
    "have been proposed at different wavelengths and emission timescales .",
    "these include sgrbs and their afterglows @xcite , optical - near ir counterparts called macronova or kilonova ( e.g. , @xcite ) and long - lasting radio merger remnants @xcite . additional radio emission and , in particular , a coherent prompt radio pulse from a magnetically - driven , relativistic plasma outflow prior to the dns merger have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "these prompt radio counterparts are both harder to detect and less certain than the above three candidates to dns mergers , so we do not discuss these in this paper ; see @xcite for a detailed study .",
    "the radio counterparts of neutron star merger events promise to uniquely probe their energetics and environment .",
    "the interaction of the merger ejecta with the circum - merger medium results in the radio remnant with timescales of a few months to years @xcite .",
    "the radio luminosity can be brighter by a couple of orders of magnitude than that of a typical radio supernovae .",
    "although such radio remnants have not been observed yet after sgrbs  ( e.g. , @xcite ) , they may be detectable by follow - up observations for gw merger events since they will take place at much closer distances than sgrbs .",
    "in addition , the sgrb jet produces the radio afterglow with timescales of a few weeks , which can be seen provided that the viewing angle is not too large .",
    "in fact , radio afterglows have been already detected for four sgrbs  ( e.g. , @xcite ) and they will be detectable counterparts of gw merger events  @xcite .",
    "recent observations suggest that the radio transient sky is far more quiet compared to the optical one , so we expect far fewer false positives by a factor of a hundred or more depending on the sky location than in the optical - ir ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this paper focuses on strategies for detecting and identifying , following a detection of a gw event , two different radio post - merger counterparts : i ) the longer duration radio remnants that may last from months to years and ii ) the faster ultra - relativistic radio afterglows components that last weeks to months @xcite .",
    "importantly , we do not consider here the ideal case in which a sgrb or an optical counterpart to a gw merger have been detected .",
    "note that a sgrb and its bright afterglow are expected only for on - axis events , which are most likely a small fraction of all events .",
    "in this case , the high - energy signal will immediately provide a much better localization enabling very accurate radio identification of the merger s position .    to define an optimal strategy for detecting radio counterparts , we run a simulation that considers both gw and radio detectability of neutron star mergers with a slew of gw and radio telescopes .",
    "our simulation comprises six steps and the structure of the paper follows these :    1 .",
    "we construct underlying astrophysically - motivated distributions of dns and bh - ns ( with a 5 m@xmath11 bh ) mergers ( sec .",
    "[ sec : catalog ] ) .",

    "we begin describing how we construct neutron star binary merger catalogs and the methods used to derive sky location , distance and inclination angle measures for populations of dns or bh - ns binary mergers detectable in gws .",
    "we first outline the schema of our method . based on sections 2",
    " 5 of @xcite ( henceforth denoted nkg13 ) , we then describe technical aspects of simulating the anticipated sky positions and distance measurements .",

    "however , each binary in our two catalogs is described by the nine parameters that are encoded in the theoretical predictions of the gw wavestrain ( or gw waveform ) for non - spinning compact binary systems ( @xcite and references therein ) . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : gwpe ] , these parameters are critical to the gw detectability as the gw waveform depends on them .",
    "they include the two compact object masses @xmath16 and @xmath17 , a sky position @xmath18 , a luminosity distance @xmath19 , an inclination angle @xmath20 , a polarization angle @xmath21 and a time and phase of gw merger .",

    "we set the time of merger to be a constant value .",
    "we specify neutron star and black hole component masses of @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "as indicated by sph and numerical relativity simulations , we choose these particular values in masses such that the mergers of the two objects will form some dynamic ejecta and the neutron star will not be swallowed entirely by the gravitational potential of a too massive bh ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ejecta create matter outflows and therefore are potentially responsible for radio afterglows and long - lasting radio remnants @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume in our simulations that the neutron stars and black holes are non - spinning ; in the physical universe we expect bhs in bh - ns systems to have a considerable spin , so there may be more dynamical ejecta produced for a neutron star orbiting in a prograde orbit around a black hole with a maximal spin . furthermore , modulo selection effects and the small sample number , observations of galactic dns systems imply a narrow mass distribution for dns systems .",

    ", we assume that the spatial distribution of neutron star binaries traces host galaxy light .",

    ", we assume that the neutron - star binary merger distribution follows a constant comoving volume density in a @xmath38cdm universe @xcite .",
    "we consider different gw networks comprising the advanced versions of ligo , virgo , kagra and ligo india ; see @xcite for a observing scenario roadmap of the ligo and virgo detectors over the next decade .",
    "each detector will operate in staggered science modes with increasing sensitivity until they reach their target design sensitivity .",
    "for instance , advanced ligo began its first observation run in september 2015 , advanced virgo could begin its first observation run as early as september 2016 and kagra could begin as early as 2019 .",
    "we make several assumptions in this work ; for instance , we assume gaussian , stationary , and zero - mean noise that is independent and uncorrelated between detectors .",
    "we also take the anticipated noise sensitivity curve for a single advanced ligo detector , given in @xcite , for broadband tuning , to be representative of all our detectors , imposing a low - frequency cut off of 10 hz ; see the recent @xcite for parameter inference methods using non - gaussian , non stationary noise .",
    "in reality , ligo , virgo and kagra will have different noise sensitivities in different frequency bands because of variations in each instrument s design , and systematic calibration effects must be taken into effect .    in the rest of the paper , we use the following notation to describe different gw networks with @xmath39 detectors : _",

    "jets produce not only the prompt gamma - ray emission but also afterglows at longer wavelength as a result of the interaction with the circum - merger material  ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . for relativistic jets ,",

    "it is worth noting that the spectral shapes of grb afterglows are different from those of the long - lasting radio remnants . for grb afterglows , as the characteristic frequency decreases with time because of the relation @xmath78 during the jet s deceleration , observers detect synchrotron radiation from higher  ( e.g. , x ray ) to lower multi - wavelength frequencies .",
    "when @xmath63 decreases to the radio frequencies , the lorentz factor , i.e , the beaming factor , is sufficiently low so that off - axis observes can detect the late - time radio signals from the jet . for observers on or close to the jet axis , observing at higher radio frequencies ( e.g. , @xmath4  ghz ) is preferable for avoiding flux losses due to synchrotron self - absorption . on the contrary , for the long - lasting radio remnants and off - axis orphan afterglows , observing at lower radio frequencies",
    "is preferable because the characteristic frequency @xmath63 is typically lower than @xmath79  ghz for sub - relativistic ejecta and off - axis afterglows .",

    "our work focuses on the follow - up surveys of gw merger events so that the observations are optimized and can reach the sensitivity as deep as @xmath320 . on the contrary",

    "identification of post - merger magnetar emission from gw events will be relatively straightforward .",
    "here we briefly summarize our recommendations for the radio surveys .",
    "we propose that radio follow - up observations of gw mergers at @xmath1  ghz take place in five epochs separated by logarithmic time intervals : within a day after the detection , at @xmath164  days , at @xmath165  days , at @xmath166  days , at @xmath324  days and at @xmath168  days . at @xmath211  ghz , a similar strategy can be employed .",
    "the radio surveys at @xmath211  ghz have an advantage of high angular resolution , which reduces the radio contamination of the host galaxies , while the peak fluxes are lower than those at @xmath1  ghz by a factor of @xmath163 . at @xmath80  mhz ,",
    "we recommend conducting intensive surveys at late times  ( a year or later ) because the radio light curves at the low frequencies arise at later times .",
    "importantly , the peak flux densities are higher than those at @xmath1  ghz",
    ". therefore , the late - time observations at @xmath80  mhz will be quite important for both the detections and confirmations of the gw radio counterparts .",
    "finally , the comparison with the optical data will be necessary to identify the redshift of the radio counterpart candidates otherwise astrophysical false positives mainly radio variable agns contaminate significantly .",
    "we have explored optimized strategies for detecting long - lasting radio signals arising from compact binary mergers following detection of gw events . to do so , we first simulated gw merger events and constructed mock catalogs of detectable gw events .",
    "we then computed the expected radio flux densities assuming different ejecta models and circum - merger densities for each detectable gw event .",
    "we focused on synchrotron radiation arising from ( i ) sub - relativistic merger ejecta  ( long - lasting radio remnants ) and ( ii ) ultra - relativistic jets  ( orphan grb afterglows ) .",
    "the radio flux densities depend on the unknown ejectas kinetic energy and velocity distributions and the circum - merger densities . here",
    "we take into account uncertainties in the ejecta s kinetic energy and velocities according to numerical simulations of compact binary mergers and three different circum - merger densities of @xmath147 , @xmath146 , and @xmath199 based on the galactic dns population .",
    "based on the derived light curves , we propose that radio follow - up observations of gw mergers at @xmath1  ghz take place in five epochs separated by logarithmic time intervals : within a day after the detection , at @xmath164  days , at @xmath165  days , at @xmath166  days , at @xmath325  days and at @xmath168  days .",
    "we compare the expected radio flux density of each gw merger event with the sensitivities of a slew of radio facilities assuming that each radio telescope searches the radio counterparts in the gw localization areas . assuming a total observation time of @xmath213  hr for each epoch",
    ", we derive the detection likelihood of each ejecta model .",
    "note that we have not taken into account northern and southern hemisphere considerations of the gw sky localizations , and hence the following relative detectability fractions should be reduced by approximately a factor of two . for the sub - relativistic merger ejecta",

    "for the orphan grb afterglows with a canonical  ( large ) kinetic energy , @xmath326 of the gw events will be detected by the jvla .",
    "we find that the detection likelihood does not change significantly for a gw network with five detectors because the gain in the radio sensitivity due to better localizations somehow compensates the loss in radio flux densities due to the increase in the gw detectable distance .    the detection likelihood increases if we conduct follow - up observations only for the well - localizable gw events . for instance",
    ", the jvla can detect more than @xmath216 ( @xmath196 ) of the gw events of which gw localization areas are better than @xmath225 for the ejecta model with medium kinetic energies , velocities , and a density of @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "note that the probability of localizing a gw dns merger to within a sky area of @xmath225 is about @xmath327 for a gw network of three detectors .",
    "the detectable radio signals at @xmath80  mhz appear at later times  ( @xmath328 years or later ) and the sensitivity of wide - field searches may be limited by the confusion noise . however",
    ", it is quite important to search for the radio counterparts at low frequency since the spectral properties at low frequency of radio counterparts are quite different from those of other radio transients and variables , e.g. , radio supernovae and agns .",
    "such observations will be significant to discriminate between radio counterparts from other astrophysical false positives .",
    "therefore , we suggest that low frequency arrays , such as lofar , search with high angular resolution for the radio counterparts of gw events for which the radio counterpart candidates have been detected earlier by other radio facilities at higher frequencies .    looking into the next decade , the square kilometer array  ( ska ) will achieve much faster survey speeds than those used in this work .",
    "it will hence detect radio counterparts of gw mergers far more efficiently . here",
    "we discuss prospects for ska - mid and focus on the detectability prospects based on dns@xmath93 at @xmath149 with the gw net 5 . in order to detect most of the radio counterparts of gw merger events at @xmath224 ,",
    "the required survey speed is @xmath285 times faster than that of the jvla .",
    "the survey speeds of ska - mid will reach this value .",
    "therefore we expect a significant progress in studies of radio counterparts once ska and gw net 5 coincidently both become operational .",
    "we discuss the possible contamination of the host galaxies , which can be divided into normal star - forming galaxies that spatially extend on a radial scale of @xmath329  kpc and agns and star - bursts that have central radio bright compact regions on a radial scale of @xmath10  kpc . for both cases , resolving the hosts will greatly reduce the contamination . for instance",
    ", the radio counterparts are identifiable for dns@xmath93 with a density of @xmath146 in milky way - like galaxies out to @xmath330  mpc .",
    "while the probability is low , mergers may take place in radio bright agns and star bursts . in order to be identifiable",
    ", the radio counterparts must be separable spatially from the galaxies bright compact regions .",
    "for such a galaxy at @xmath154  mpc , we estimate that the fractions that the radio counterpart are masked due to galaxy contamination are @xmath195 , @xmath89 , and @xmath254 for the jvla a configuration , b configuration , and askap respectively .",
    "astrophysical false positives , include extragalactic radio transients and variables , may mimic the radio counterparts .",
    "we estimate that a few to tens of radio transients will be detectable at @xmath195  mjy as false positives and most of them maybe type ii supernovae .",
    "these false positives can be rejected by using the optical identification of supernovae , their longer timescales , and strong - absorption feature in the radio spectra .    the false positives due to radio variables will be more problematic .",
    "a few hundreds to thousands of variables  ( mainly agns ) will be detectable at flux densities comparable to the detectable gw - radio counterparts in a gw localization area of @xmath331 .",
    "most of these false - positives will be located at distances far beyond the gw detectable distance and they can be rejected as merger candidates by identifying their distances or redshifts .",
    "however , there will be a few to tens of radio variables in the gw - localization volumes .",
    "moreover some fraction of radio variables beyond the gw - horizon distance will be located behind the host galaxy candidates .",
    "they can be rejected by using multi - epoch variability test , the location of the host , and the flatter spectra than that of the radio counterparts .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the number of false positives is significantly reduced for well - localized events .",
    "we expect there to be less than one false positive for such an event .",
    "note the number of false positives due to variables per unit sky area depends on the sensitivity , degree of variability , observed frequency , and the sky direction , so that a better understanding of the statistical properties of radio variables will be important for identifying radio counterparts .    in summary",
    ", while there are uncertainties in the ejectas kinetic energy , velocity , and circum - merger density , a certain fraction of gw merger events will be detectable with current and upcoming radio facilities .",
    "in addition , identifying radio counterparts will not be so difficult thanks to the relatively quite radio transient sky .",
    "we therefore advocate radio counterpart surveys for gw merger events of which em counterparts in other wavelengths  ( e.g. , x - ray and optical ) have not been detected using not only the gw sky error but the gw distance and the use of galaxy catalogs thanks to the relatively long timescales of the radio emission .",
