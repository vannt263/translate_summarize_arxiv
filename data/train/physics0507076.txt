    "the positive column of gas discharge has been experimentally studied for a long time but still there are some lack of the simulation techniques which are able to reproduce discharge properties in closed details .",
    "modeling of the positive column ( pc ) is based mostly on fluid approaches , which are inapplicable for sheath region as well for low pressures and small currents because they do not reflect the physical picture of discharge ( due to assumption of maxwellian electron distribution function and simplified treatment of photon transfer ) and results in inadequate simulation .",
    "as it was well established , electron component of discharge generally reaches a state far from the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "hence the temporal and spatial distributions of anisothermic plasmas can be described only on appropriate microphysical basis .",
    "there are two quite different approaches .",
    "one way consists of the formulation of a kinetic equation and its approximate solution .",
    "until recently , most studies of the electron behavior in positive columns based on solution of the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "the other approach uses the technique of the particle - in - cell simulation coupled with monte - carlo ( mc ) event selection .",
    "the last method has no disadvantages of the kinetic boltzmann method , and it is limited only the available computing power @xcite .    electron and ion motions in low temperature plasmas may be studied by mc approach in which the path of a single particle is traced by computer simulation .",
    "the particle is considered to move classically during period of free flight under influence of a self - consistent electric field .",
    "this field is determined by electron and ion density according to poison s law .",
    "the free flight is interrupted with scattering by neutral atoms , ionization , excitation , wall loss and other kind of collisions which must be considered in the model of discharge . the free flight length and outcome of these events are selected randomly from known probability distributions .",
    "transport properties of the discharge under investigation are found from the time average of the behavior of the individual particle .",
    "when an collision occurs one of the possible collision mechanisms must be chosen .",
    "the probability of each mechanism is proportional to its frequency",
    ". then the particle velocity is modified according to the physical nature of the mechanism chosen .",
    "the simulation of a number of particles may be carried out simultaneously and the time dependence of their behavior can be derived from an ensemble average .    resonance photon transfer is also very important for a quantitative simulation of gas discharge tube as well the charged particle motion .",
    "a new simple monte - carlo treatment of radiation imprisonment based on holstein - biberman theory @xcite is developed and embedded into the model .",
    "we present a high accurate self - consistent monte - carlo approach to simulation of the positive column of argon discharge in this short report .",
    "at present model the first 14 excited ar levels are involved into consideration . the 15th level of argon @xmath1 is a combined level that represents great number of the higher excited atomic levels as one state .",
    "we assume that ar may be ionized and excited or de - excited by electron - atom collisions according to general formula which can be written as : @xmath2 where a is atomic symbol , index @xmath3 denotes initial state ( before collision ) , @xmath4 corresponds to the final state , and @xmath5 is a cross section for given pair @xmath6 and electron kinetic energy is @xmath7 . in the case of @xmath8 eq.([eq : pt02 ] ) represents excitations and ionization of atom , elastic scattering in the case of @xmath9 , and super - elastic electron - atom collisions for @xmath10 .",
    "the electron excitation and ionization cross sections are taken from refs.@xcite .",
    "after ionization of atom a new electron appears .",
    "we assume that both the ejected and scattered electrons are redistributed isotropically , and both electrons randomly share available energy which is given by subtracting the ionization energy for a given energy level from the kinetic energy of the incident electron . at very low pressure of argon",
    "the excitation of inner electron shells of atom and multiple ionization becomes more probable due to the higher electron temperature .",
    "the present model contains very simplified calculation of double ionization events and may obtain only qualitative description of discharges at electron temperature @xmath11ev .",
    "the cross section of the super - elastic collisions @xmath12 ( reverse reaction to eq.([eq : pt02 ] ) ) is calculated according to the principle of detailed balance @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is initial electron kinetic energy , @xmath16 is a degeneracy of the energy level . therefore the inverse cross section @xmath17     solid line correspond to momentum transfer cross section for electrons in argon @xcite .",
    "note the ramsauer minimum below 1 ev .",
    "dash line denotes electron impact ionization cross section from ground state of ar . ]    in the mc model we consider elastic electron - ar scattering by using the published momentum transfer cross section @xcite ( see fig.[fig : els_e - ar ] ) . on average an elastic recoil energy loss of @xmath18 of the incident kinetic energy",
    "are used in all simulations . here",
    "@xmath19 is electron mass and @xmath20 is argon atom mass .",
    "after elastic collision an electron is redistributed isotropically in the center - of - mass ( cm ) system .    it is often supposed in positive column models that all ions and electrons reaching the tube wall recombine one another .",
    "this assumption is also used in our model .",
    "recombination of ions at wall produces the neutral atoms in ground state .",
    "the program redistributes uniformly these atoms within tube domain to maintain balance of the atom number density .",
    "momentum transfer cross section and resonant charge transfer cross section for @xmath21 in parent gas .",
    "lines are fitted functions , symbols denote experimental data @xcite . ]    in contrast to elastic electron - atom collisions where energy exchange is limited by factor @xmath22 , energy exchange in electron - electron collision has the same order as energy of colliding electrons and moreover a huge electron - electron momentum transfer cross section ( coulomb cross section ) . for low axial electric field and",
    "not too small current , the electron - electron collisions result mainly in energy transfer from cold bulk electrons to hot tail electrons which are responsible for particle ( ionization ) balance in discharge .",
    "so the correct treatment of electron - electron collisions is one of the key elements of the discharge simulation .    to describe electron - electron collisions by mc simulation we are using classical coulomb cross section @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is debye length and @xmath25 is coulomb radius",
    ", @xmath26 is the reduced mass of colliding electrons , @xmath27 is their relative speed , and @xmath28 are the local electron density and temperature .",
    "the energy exchange during particle - particle ( here electron - electron ) scattering depends on the velocity vectors of a projectile 1st - particle and target 2nd - particle according to equations : @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the velocities of particles in the laboratory system after collision .",
    "the unknown unit vector @xmath33 is assumed to distribute isotropically",
    ".    calculation of electron - electron collisional frequency takes much larger computational power than electron - heavy particles collisional frequency because of target electron distribution is unknown a priori .",

    "we assume in our model that the local collisional frequency @xmath46 in eq.([eq : pt09 ] ) depends only on electron kinetic energy @xmath47 instead of vector velocity @xmath48 .",
    "then the collisional frequency @xmath49 for electrons having kinetic energy in the @xmath50 energy bin @xmath51 becomes @xmath52 here @xmath53 if @xmath54 , and @xmath55 if @xmath56 , @xmath57 is number of projectile electrons in @xmath50-bin .",
    "the electron - ion and ion - ion elastic collision processes are also included to the model in the same manner as for electron - electron collision .",
    "however according to our simulation these processes do not play any significant role in the pc .",
    "it should be note that for arbitrary projectile - target pair the relative velocity may be a very small value and the corresponding coulomb radius @xmath58 in eq.([eq : pt05 ] ) becomes larger than debye length and/or spatial mesh size . in these cases the electron - electron collision event is assumed as a null collision because the long range electron interactions are already included in solution of poisson s equation .",
    "ion transport in the ion - parent - atom case is mostly guided by resonant charge transfer because of its cross section is large at low collision energies .",
    "we use a simple fitted function for the charge transfer cross section @xcite given by @xmath59 here @xmath60[ev ] is a kinetic energy of a projectile ion in cm system , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the fitting parameters : @xmath63[ ] , @xmath64[ ] , see fig.[fig : els_i - ar ] . due to the large cross section the ions and atoms are practically undeflected in the center - of - mass system . therefore ,",
    "after the resonant charge transition occurs a new ion will accept velocity of the neutral atom which are randomly generated according normal distribution function for a given gas temperature which is assumed to be constant across the tube .",
    "polarization scattering of ion by a neutral atom can be described by momentum transfer cross section @xcite ( without @xmath65 term ) : @xmath66 where @xmath67 cm is bohr radius , @xmath68ev is ionization potential of hydrogen atom , and @xmath69 is kinetic energy of relative motion of ion and atom ( that is in the cm system ) .",

    "reduced mobility of @xmath21 in argon gas is @xmath74 @xcite , hence the experimental drift velocity for gas pressure 0.261 torr and electric field 2 v / cm is 93.18 m / s which is in good agreement with simulated @xmath21 drift velocity 92.3 m / s .",
    "we take into account excited atom - atom collision ionization process as follow @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is any one of a number of excited ar levels .",

    "ionization frequency @xmath154 is a function of the axial electric field @xmath157 .",
    "hence @xmath157 is independent of electric current and only determined by electron wall - loss frequency .",
    "we may extend schottky theoretical model by including ionization from one sort of the excited resonance atoms only as it have been done in @xcite : @xmath158 @xmath159 where @xmath160 is radiative decay frequency of x - level atom to ground state 0 , @xmath161 is number density of excited atoms . by solving eq.([eq : pb02b ] ) for @xmath161 and rewrite eq.([eq : pb02b ] ) to obtain balance equation @xmath162 it is clear that the ionization term in eq.([eq : pb03 ] ) is superlinear in @xmath150 , except the case @xmath163 ( high current ) .",

    "because the number of metastable atoms is much higher than the number of resonance atoms in low current region eq.([eq : pb05 ] ) conforms to the discharge much better than eqs.([eq : pb02a],[eq : pb02b ] ) .",

    "these superlinear terms result in negative slope of v - i curve .",
    "but with increasing of current the atom - atom ionization term @xmath176 becomes a sublinear term in @xmath150 ( almost independent of @xmath150 ) , but the impact ionization from metastable atoms tends to linear term in @xmath150 .",
    "it may cause a positive slope of v - i curve if @xmath177 for further increasing of current we have to take in consideration the electron impact ionization from resonance states ( see eq.([eq : pb04a],[eq : pb04b ] ) ) and transitions between metastable and resonance states .",
    "it adds to eq.([eq : pb07 ] ) a new superlinear ionization term which have to turn v - i curve from the growth to the drop of voltage .",
    "therefore the unknown whole electron balance equations have to contain the ionization rates consisting from the sublinear , linear , and superlinear terms as we show above .",
    "the interplay between them results in a slope of v - i curve .",
    "we may distinguish at least three electric current region in accordance with slope sign of the v - i curve .",
    "low current region ( ionization from metastable atom @xmath169 ) corresponds to the negative slope , the middle current region is for the positive slope ( due to independence of atom - atom ionization rate on @xmath150 ) , and the high current region corresponds again to the negative slope ( due to superlinear ionization from excited atoms @xmath178 ) .",
    "we have to note that this theoretical model is not applicable for very low current pc where the electron - wall loss frequency @xmath149 depends on electron density @xmath150 , and the electron temperature significantly grows with decreasing of current .",
    "the general condition to be satisfied for maintenance of the column can be written as @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is a mean life time of an electron ( @xmath181 at steady conditions ) .",
    "it is clear ( and easy to see on simulation data ) that lower electron density / current discharge results in more strong radial electric field @xmath182 in bulk plasma and relatively smaller one in sheath than in higher current case . under the influence of this radial field",
    "the ions are accelerated towards tube wall much faster in the lower current pc .",
    "the cause of that the mean ion velocity @xmath183 is mostly determined by first term and almost does not depends on a variation of ion density profile .",
    "therefore the mean life time of ions / electrons is longer for higher current pc and , hence , ionization rate per a electron must decrease with increasing of current to sustain the discharge at balance .",
    "this conclusion is quite general but it can not directly determine the slope of voltage - current curve . nevertheless , for the simplest model ( or for enough small current ) where the ionization rate depends strongly on axial electric field @xmath157 , the equilibrium axial electric field @xmath157 have to be also less for higher current positive column @xcite .    finally we may conclude that the developed particle balance theory itself can not predict precisely the sign of v - i slope because the axial electric field @xmath157 responds first of all for energy balance in discharge .",

    "excited atoms in their turn gain / lose energy by the electron hits and radiative transitions , and lose energy by diffusion to the tube wall .",
    "our mc program provides detailed information on these all processes included in the model . according to our simulation the distribution of power loss across the tube is not uniform .",
    "figure [ fig : ei - loss ] shows strong nonuniformity in the spatial dependencies of elastic electron - atom and ion - atom power loss in pure argon discharge simulation .",
    "elastic ( and charge exchange ) ion - atom collisions becomes more important than elastic electron - atom power loss near the tube wall due to strong acceleration of ions by radial electric field , especially in the sheath .",

    "simulation shows that the power balance maintains with a good accuracy . to reveal the influence of dissipating n - channel on the axial electric field @xmath157 we may rewrite eq.([eq : eb01 ] ) as @xmath189 where @xmath190 is a partial axial field which corresponds to n - channel of the total power dissipation . by using the partial electric field @xmath190 we may easily estimate contribution of each n - channel to the total energy loss in a steady pc and , moreover , determine the real atomic reasons behind variation of measured axial field @xmath157 .",
