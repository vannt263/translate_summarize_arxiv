    "the majority of the mass in the universe is known to consist of dark matter ( dm ) of unknown composition .",
    "identifying the nature of this dark matter is one of the outstanding problems in physics and astrophysics .",
    "leading candidates for this dark matter are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , a generic class of particles that includes the lightest supersymmetric particle .",
    "these particles undergo weak interactions and their expected masses range from 1  gev to 10  tev .",
    "many wimps , if present in thermal equilibrium in the early universe , annihilate with one another , leaving behind a relic density found to be roughly the correct value . furthermore , recent interest in low mass wimps lead us to mention asymmetric dark matter models , which naturally predict light wimps @xcite .",
    "thirty years ago , refs . @xcite",
    "first proposed the idea of detecting weakly interacting particles , including neutrinos and wimps , via coherent scattering with nuclei .",
    "soon after @xcite computed detection rates in the context of a galactic halo of wimps .",
    "this work also showed that the count rate in wimp direct detection experiments will experience an annual modulation @xcite as a result of the motion of the earth around the sun .",
    "then development of ultra - pure ge detectors permitted the first limits on wimps @xcite . since that time",
    ", a multitude of experimental efforts to detect wimps has been underway , with some of them currently claiming detection .",
    "the basic goal of direct detection experiments is to measure the energy deposited when weakly interacting particles scatter off of nuclei in the detector , depositing small amounts of energy , e.g. 1 - 10 kev , in the nucleus . a recent review of the basic calculations of dark matter detection , with an emphasis on annual modulation ,",
    "may be found in @xcite .",
    "numerous collaborations worldwide have been searching for wimps using a variety of techniques to detect the nuclear recoil . in this paper",
    "we elaborate on a novel mechanism for direct detection of wimps using explosives @xcite .",
    "the small amount of energy deposited in the nucleus by the wimp scattering event can be enough to trigger an explosion .",
    "the registration of such an explosion then indicates that a wimp / nucleon scattering event took place . in our search for appropriate explosive materials",

    "everything on the surface of earth , including the conventional chemical explosives , has been constantly bombarded by ionizing particles coming from trace amounts of naturally occurring radioactive materials and cosmic radiation . since",
    "conventional explosives can be stored in large quantities for extended periods of time ( without blowing up ) , we may conclude that all the conventional explosives that are currently being used in commercial or military applications can not be used in dm detection applications .",
    "this does not imply that there are no explosives that can be detonated by a single highly ionizing particle .",
    "if one were to synthesize such a material it would be highly unstable and would mysteriously explode .",
    "we need to be  contrarians \" and test such  unsafe \" explosives , which were discovered but rejected in prior r&d .",
    "luckily there are two directions to pursue .",
    "first , the chemical explosive , nitrogen triodine ( ni@xmath2 ) , has been studied and can be ignited by a single highly ionizing particle ( e.g. an @xmath3-particle ) @xcite .",
    "future work on using ni@xmath2 for dm detectors will be interesting . in this paper",
    "we instead study the second approach , nanothermites .",
    "thermites have been used for more than 100 years to obtain bursts of very high temperatures in small volumes , typically a few @xmath4 .",
    "thermites are two component explosives , consisting of a metal and either an oxide or a halide .",
    "these two components are stable when kept separated from one another ; but when they are brought together they undergo a rapid exothermic reaction  an explosion .",
    "the classical examples are @xmath5 one advantage of thermites is the impressive number of elements , which can be used .",
    "classic implementation of thermites uses micron scale ( 1 to 10 microns ) granulation , but in recent years nano - sized granules of high explosives have been increasingly used @xcite .",
    "these nano - thermites make interesting dark matter detectors . when a wimp strikes the metal layer , the metal may heat up sufficiently to overcome the chemical energy barrier between the metal and metal - oxide .",
    "an explosion results .",
    "nanoexplosive dark matter detectors have several advantages :    1 .",
    "they can operate at room temperature ; 2 .",
    "low energy threshold of 0.5 kev , allowing for study of low mass @xmath6 gev wimps ; 3 .",
    "flexibility of materials : one may choose from a variety of elements with high atomic mass ( _ e.g. _ tl or ta ) to maximize the spin - independent scattering rate . given a variety of materials one can also extract information about the mass and cross section of the wimps ; 4 .",
    "one can also select materials with high nuclear spin to maximize spin - dependent interaction rate ; 5 .",
    "signal is amplified by the chain reaction of explosions ; 6 .",
    "excellent background rejection due to physical granularity of the detector .",
    "because the cells containing the nanoparticles are less than a micron in size , the detector has the resolution to differentiate between wimp nuclear recoils , which only interact with one cell of our detectors , and other backgrounds ( such as @xmath3-particles , @xmath7-particles and @xmath8-rays ) which travel through many cells .",
    "thus , if the background has enough energy to cause the ignition of one cell , then it would ignite multiple cells . in the section @xmath9 , the typical ranges (",

    "enough energy deposit in the metal sphere heats it up to the point where there is an explosion beginning at the interface of the two materials at the edge of the nanoparticle . as a specific design ,",
    "we imagine constructing a  cell \" which consists of @xmath12 metal nanoparticles embedded in an oxide .",
    "a full detector will need many of these cells ; e.g. to obtain 1 kg of target material ( the metal ) there will be @xmath13 cells . a wimp hitting",

    "two different images are depicted at the bottom of the figure : ( a ) shows the design model used for all calculations , and ( b ) represents a more realistic depiction of the nano - thermite detector .",
    "the dissimilarity between both images is the addition of a passivation layer in image ( b ) .",
    "a passivation layer is a metal - oxide coating placed around the nanoparticle in order to prevent oxygen molecules interacting with the metal .",
    "an oxidized metal will not react chemically with a metal - oxide , since it is no longer favorable to gain oxygen atoms .",
    "thus , an oxidized metal will not produce a thermite reaction .",
    "the passivation layer covering the metal nanoparticle would be required in the synthesis of the detector ; since it would prevent oxidation of the metal nanoparticle during construction of the detector ( i.e. before embedding the nanoparticle into the cell ) . as well , in some differing implementations , the metal - oxide of the cell could be comprised of mixed nano - wires @xcite , which would produce a larger temperature increase due to a higher effective thermal resistance between the oxide and the metal .",
    "image ( a ) represents a simplified design model , which enabled analytic results in later sections .",
    "]    more precisely , when a wimp elastically scatters with a metal nucleus and deposits energy to the metal , then that energy is converted into a temperature increase .",
    "if the temperature increase is big enough to overcome the potential barrier of the thermite reaction , then the metal will react with the surrounding oxidizer exothermically . in the design using metal nanoparticles ,",
    "after the first thermite reaction of one nanoparticle occurs , the exothermic heat produced by the thermite will heat up the other metal nanoparticles within the 0.5 @xmath11 m cell ; thus creating a chain reaction which amplifies the signal to a measurable effect .",
    "utilizing eq [ thermite ] as an example , the amplification factor for the signal is on the order of @xmath14-@xmath15 .",
    "the detection of the cell explosions could be made by sensitive microphones or spectroscopic studies of the debris .",
    "figure [ detectorfinal ] shows a schematic representation of the nano - thermite detector studied in this paper . on top",
    ", the first picture of figure [ detectorfinal ] shows an array of cells embedded into an insulating material .",
    "the insulator is used to thermally decouple the cells ; so that the reaction within a cell does not cause the explosion of neighboring cells .",
    "the length of each cell is taken to be @xmath16 m .",
    "the spatial scale of the cells enable us to distinguish background from wimp / nucleus collisions .",
    "backgrounds composed of @xmath3 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 particles will traverse multiple cells ; whereas a recoiled ion from a wimp / nucleus collision will only interact with a single cell .",

    "the nanoparticles , represented by the white circles , are embedded into the metal - oxide , shown as the black background .",
    "finally , the bottom pictures of figure [ detectorfinal ] depicts an enlarged section of the cell surrounding a single nanoparticle of radius @xmath17 nm .",
    "there are two pictures at the bottom .",
    "image ( a ) shows the simplified model used to make all the calculations in the sections @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "in contrast , image ( b ) depicts a more realistic design for the nano - thermite detector .",
    "a thin passivation layer is placed around the metal to prevent oxidation of the metal during the construction of the detector ( i.e. before embedding the metal nanoparticle into the cell ) .",
    "the passivation layer is a metal - oxide coating placed around the nanoparticle in order to prevent oxygen molecules interacting with the metal .",
    "an oxidized metal will not react chemically with a metal - oxide , since it is no longer favorable to gain oxygen atoms .",
    "thus , an oxidized metal will not produce a thermite reaction . however , the passivating barrier is lowered if the metal nanoparticle or the passivation layer melts due to the temperature increase . in a realistic scenario ,",
    "the synthesis of the nanoparticle embedded into the oxide would require a passivation layer .",
    "it should be noted that the addition of an extra layer between the metal and the oxide of the cell would produce an additional thermal resistance at the interfaces .",
    "this thermal resistance would cause the metal to hold in heat ; and thus , increase the temperature increase yield after a wimp / nucleus collision , when compared to the results presented in this paper . as well , in some differing implementations , the metal - oxide of the cell could be comprised of mixed nano - wires @xcite , which would produce a larger temperature increase due to a higher effective thermal resistance between the oxide and the metal .",
    "as explained in the section @xmath18 , the temperature increase is calculated utilizing the design model of image ( a ) ( i.e. no passivation layer ) and zero thermal resistance between the oxide and the metal nanoparticle .",
    "thus , our calculations are conservative and underestimate the temperature increase sourced by an elastic collision between a wimp and a metal nucleus .",
    "more generally , many other detector designs may be possible , such as two parallel layers of the two components .",
    "this latter design would allow determination of the direction from which the wimp came , as only wimps headed first into the metal ( rather than first into the oxide ) would initiate an explosion .    the goal of this paper is to study the ignition of the explosion when a wimp hits the metal nanoparticle . a parallel paper @xcite studies the nano boom dark matter detectors more generally , including methods of detection and readout of the explosion ; alternate explosives other than thermites ; and other aspects of the problem .    in this paper",
    "we begin by reviewing the relevant particle and astrophysics of direct detection , and then turn to the viability of a nanothermite detector for wimps . for our calculations",
    "we consider wimp masses of @xmath20 gev .",
    "wimp direct detection experiments seek to measure the energy deposited when a wimp interacts with a nucleus in a detector .",
    "if a wimp of mass @xmath21 scatters elastically from a nucleus of mass @xmath22 , it will deposit a recoil energy @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the reduced mass of the wimp - nucleus system , @xmath25 is the speed of the wimp relative to the nucleus , and @xmath26 is the scattering angle in the center of mass frame . the typical energy transferred to the nucleus in a scattering event is from 0.1 to 50 kev , depending on the wimp mass and the detector material .",
    "typical count rates in detectors are less than 1 count per kg of detector per day",
    ". reviews of the dark matter scattering process and direct detection can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . over the past twenty five years a variety of designs",
    "have been developed to detect wimps .",
    "they include detectors that measure scintillation ; ionization ; and dilution - refrigerator based calorimeters which measure the total energy deposed by means of a phonon spectrum .",
    "current detector masses range in size up to 100 kg",
    ". the upcoming generation of detectors will reach one tonne .",
    "a major concern in all wimp detectors is backgrounds . to eliminate spurious events from cr ,",
    "the detectors must be placed deep underground ( @xmath0 2,000 m of water equivalent ) . yet",
    "radioactive backgrounds remain and must be eliminated .",
    "thus the experimental determination of annual and/or diurnal modulation is a crucial test of the wimp origin of any events observed in the detector , as most backgrounds should not exhibit the same time dependence .",
    "* particle physics : wimp / nucleus cross sections : *    for a supersymmetric ( susy ) neutralino and many other wimp candidates , the dominant wimp - quark couplings in direct detection experiments are the scalar and axial - vector couplings , which give rise to spin - independent ( si ) and spin - dependent ( sd ) cross - sections for elastic scattering of a wimp with a nucleus , respectively .",
    "si scattering is typically taken to be @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the atomic mass of the nucleus , @xmath29 is the wimp - proton reduced mass and @xmath30 is the si scattering cross section of wimps with protons . for large momentum transfer , this relation is multiplied by a form factor correction to account for the sensitivity to the spatial structure of the nucleus .",
    "since the si cross - section grows rapidly with nuclear mass , direct detection experiments often use heavy nuclei to increase their sensitivity to wimp scattering .",
    "spin - dependent ( sd ) wimp - nucleus interactions depend on the spin of the nucleus .",
    "most nuclei have equal numbers of neutrons and protons so that there is no sd contribution ; specific nuclei must be chosen in experiments to search for nonzero sd couplings .",
    "sd scattering is often of lesser significance than si scattering in direct detection experiments for the heavy elements used in most detectors due to the extra @xmath31 coherence factor in the cross section .",
    "* astrophysics : velocity structure of the galactic halo : *    the velocity distribution @xmath32 of dark matter particles in the galactic halo is crucial to their signals in dark matter detectors ( as first stressed by @xcite ) .",
    "the dark matter halo in the local neighbourhood is likely to be composed mainly of a smooth , well mixed ( virialised ) component with an average density @xmath33  gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the simplest model of this smooth component is the standard halo model ( shm ) , a spherically symmetric nonrotating isothermal sphere with an isotropic , maxwellian velocity distribution characterized by an rms velocity dispersion @xmath34 km / sec ; the distribution is truncated at escape velocity @xmath35 550 km / sec in the galactic rest frame , or @xmath35 750 km / sec in the laboratory frame ( the frame of the earth ) where the measurements are made .",
    "the resultant count rates in direct detection experiments due to the shm were first discussed in @xcite .",
    "a key issue for dark matter detectors using nano - explosives is the question of whether or not a wimp deposits enough energy in the detector to initiate an explosion .",
    "the wimp velocity plays a key role , as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy_deposit ] ) .",
    "we will study two different wimp velocities .",
    "first , we take the typical wimp speed , which is roughly 300 km / sec in the lab frame . however , it is possible that , although the typical wimp is not sufficient to set off an explosion , there are plenty of high velocity wimps on the tail of the distribution that do cause explosions .",
    "in fact many existing dark matter detectors ( such as lux , xenon , and cdms ) rely on this tail in obtaining results for low mass wimps near the threshold of their sensitivities .",
    "thus , as our second case , we will consider fast wimps with speeds of 700 km / sec in the lab frame .",
    "herein , we study both cases for oxide - based nano - thermites ; and aim to extend the study both cases for halide - based nano - thermites in future work .",
    "a related question is the value of the energy recoil , which depends on the scattering angle ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy_deposit ] ) ) .",
    "the maximum recoil energy takes place for forward scattering with an angle of @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 in some cases a more typical value of the energy recoil is half of the maximum , but an accurate calculation including form factors for the detailed interactions with the nucleons inside the nucleus would be required and is the subject of future work . for our case of 300 km / sec wimp speed ,",
    "we assume a characteristic energy of 1/2 the maximum energy recoil ; whereas for the fast wimps with 700 km / sec , we assume the maximum energy recoil . in the future",
    "it would be interesting to integrate over the entire wimp velocity distribution , with results dependent on the detector material of choice as well as wimp mass .",
    "* current experimental status for direct detection : *    in the past decade , a host of direct detection experiments using a variety of different detector materials and designs have reported unexplained nuclear recoil signals which could be due to wimps .",
    "detection of annual modulation has now been claimed by the dama and , more recently , cogent experiments .",
    "the italian dark matter experiment , or dama @xcite , consists of 250 kg of radio pure nai scintillator situated in the gran sasso tunnel underneath the apennine mountains near rome , and became the first direct detection experiment to observe a positive signal .",
    "the group now has accumulated 1 ton - yr of data over the past decade and finds an 8.9 @xmath38 annual modulation with the correct phase and spectrum to be consistent with a dark matter signal .",
    "recently cogent @xcite , consisting of germanium , also claim to see annual modulation of the signal with the correct phase to be consistent with wimps , and together with a third cresst - ii @xcite experiment , could be seeing @xmath3910 gev wimps .",
    "the cdms experiment also has seen a few unexplained events in their silicon detectors at low energies @xcite , that might be compatible with low mass wimps .",
    "however , other experiments , notably cdms - ge @xcite , supercdms @xcite , xenon @xcite and lux @xcite , have null results that conflict with these positive signals and may rule them out .",
    "many direct detection experiments are either currently running or gearing up to do so , and we can expect more data soon .",
    "the coupp @xcite@xcite , picasso @xcite , simple @xcite , and pico @xcite ( a new collaboration between the coupp and picasso teams ) experiments are the most similar to the nano explosives proposed here .",
    "picasso and simple use superheated droplet detectors and coupp uses bubble chambers . these detectors go through a phase transition when hit by a wimp ; easily visible bubbles form in the bubble chambers .",
    "these detectors operate at room temperature and are sensitive to low mass wimps , down to about 15 gev .",
    "the new pico collaboration aims for a 3 kev energy threshold , allowing it to study wimps of even lower masses ; their limitations are due to gamma - ray backgrounds .",
    "one of our goals is to explore new materials and designs that allow the detector to have even lower threshold and sensitivity to even lighter wimps .",
    "because our targets are nm in size , we have the resolution to differentiate between wimp nuclear recoils , which only interact with one cell of our detectors , and other backgrounds ( such as @xmath3s and @xmath8s ) which travel through many cells and cause multiple ignitions .    in the past few years",
    "the cross - sections that have been reached by detectors have improved by three orders of magnitude ; over the next few years another two orders of magnitude should be reached .",
    "the next generation of detectors being built will be one tonne in mass or directional .",
    "a review of the theory and experimental status of dark matter detection can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of using nano explosive dm detectors is to design low threshold detectors that can test the light mass @xmath110 gev hypothesis .",
    "for a given energy deposit by a wimp ( given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy_deposit ] ) , the amount that the nanoparticle heats up is determined by @xmath40 where the heat capacity of the nanoparticle @xmath41 depends on the material as well as on the size of the nanoparticle .",
    "it is instructive to see specific examples of eq [ [ eq.heat_capacity ] ] in order to get an idea of the amount of temperatures roughly expected to be produced inside the nanoparticle .",
    "the specific heat per volume of al is @xmath42 kev / nm@xmath43 . the heat capacity for an aluminum nanoparticle of radius @xmath44  nm is @xmath45 kev / k .",
    "thus , the expected temperature increase for an aluminum nanoparticle with an energy of @xmath46 kev deposited by a wimp interacting with an aluminum nucleus is @xmath47 k. the ignition temperature for a micron - size @xmath48 thermite necessary for the reaction to begin is roughly @xmath49 k , which implies that a nanoparticle with radius ( @xmath50 nm ) could produce high enough temperatures for the thermite reaction to begin and produce an explosion .",
    "the low values of the heat capacity for metal nanoparticles allows for a very large temperature increase .",
    "this is one of the main reasons for pursuing nano - thermites as a possible wimp detector . in this paper",
    ", we aim to improve our previous calculation with eq [ [ eq.heat_capacity ] ] in order to establish if the nanoparticle could work as a wimp detector or not .",
    "there are two issues that need to be considered .",
    "the first complication arises from the fact that the metal nanoparticle will not retain the temperature increase for an infinite amount of time and will dissipate heat following the dynamics of the heat transfer equation .",
    "the question of whether the thermite reaction will begin or not needs to be addressed by studying the heat transfer equation in order to establish the amount of time the nanoparticle stays heated .",
    "then the arrhenius equation approximates the reaction rate given a specific chemical reaction , size of the nanoparticle and temperature .",
    "this reaction rate is multiplied by the timescale determined from the heat transfer equation to estimate the probability of a nanoparticle exploding .",
    "the arrhenius equation allows us to estimate the quantum efficiency of detonation , the probability that a detonation would occur following a nucleus recoil event .",
    "the second complication considered is the distance traveled by the recoiling nucleus .",
    "it is expected that sometimes the recoiling nucleus will escape the metal nanoparticle after interacting with the wimp .",
    "the escaping nucleus will not depose all of its energy into the nanoparticle . the range at which the recoiling nucleus stops needs to be understood in order to approximate correctly the amount of energy deposed into the metal nanoparticle .",
    "calculations to address these two complications ; utilizing the heat transfer equation , the reaction rate and stopping distance for the recoiling nucleus in order to establish the viability of nano - thermites as wimp detectors ; will be done in later sections below .",
    "we may ask what temperature increase is required to initiate an explosion . here",
    "we describe the basic idea , and continue in detail in the next section .",
    "we treat the system as a phase transition with a barrier that must be overcome in order for the thermite reaction to take place .",
    "the ability to use nano - thermites for dark matter detection is pulled in two contrary directions . on the one hand ,",
    "the material must be chosen so that it does not spontaneously explode due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "we may require no spontaneous explosion for at least one year ; this requirement determines the barrier height for the chemical reaction",
    ". the required barrier height can be quite significant and is particularly restrictive for a detector operating at room temperature . yet , on the other hand , we would like the most sensitive possible detectors to incoming wimps .",
    "ideally the materials with the smallest required temperature increase ( due to a wimp hit ) would detect the most wimps .",
    "we ve seen that typical wimp interactions deposit 0.1 - 50 kev s of energy .",
    "given the barrier height required to avoid spontaneous combustion , temperature increases of @xmath01000 k are required for the thermite reaction to take place at room temperature .",
    "we will see that heavy wimps with masses above 100 gev ( or for some materials above 1 tev ) are able to deposit enough energy ( @xmath010 kev ) to cause ignition at room temperature for the detector geometry considered in this paper ( other more favorable geometries are considered in the companion paper @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to operate at cryogenic temperatures , such as 77 k using liquid nitrogen or 4.2 k using liquid helium as coolants . at these lower temperatures , the thermal fluctuations that produce spontaneous ignition",
    "are less effective , and we may choose a material with a lower barrier height for the phase transition without spontaneous detonation . in this case the detector can react to lower temperature increases @xmath39 50 k , corresponding to lower energy thresholds , for some materials as low as @xmath39 0.5 kev . some of the explosives that are designed to operate at 4.2 k may not be stable at room temperature . to realize such explosives we need to develop cryogenic methods of mixing metal nanoparticles and oxides . when operating cryogenically , the nano explosive wimp detector can detect @xmath110 gev wimps better than any previous dark matter detector .",
    "we can see the advantages of using nano - thermites , rather than larger micron - sized ones :    1 .",
    "only when the objects are nano - sized is their specific heat small enough to allow operating at room temperature .",
    "smaller detector elements have smaller @xmath41 and thus , for the same energy deposited by a wimp , larger temperature increase ( see eq.([eq.heat_capacity ] ) ) . for nano - sized thermites",
    "the temperature increase due to wimp interactions is large enough to cause an explosion ; whereas for micron - sized thermites the temperature increase would be too low . 2",
    ".   low energy threshold of 0.5 kev , allowing for study of low mass @xmath6gev wimps , can be achieved when : 1 .",
    "operating at cryogenic temperatures ; 2 .   using chemically active metals with low melting temperatures such as : gallium , rubidium , caesium , indium , tin , lead or bismuth ; 3 .",
    "employing f - based ( fluorine - based ) nano - thermites",
    "( e.g. al @xmath51 wf@xmath52 ) ; 4 .   considering more advance models other than nanoparticles embedded in an oxide . +",
    "the possibility of reaching lower energy thresholds through the implementation of cryogenic temperatures will be further discussed in this paper .",
    "a detailed discussion for the design concepts ( b)-(d ) is beyond the scope of this paper and will be discussed in forthcoming papers .",
    "3 .   only when the detector elements have a size smaller than the track range of background can one use new methods of background rejection .",
    "the track lengths of recoiling nuclei are @xmath53 nm , which is much smaller than the typical range of an @xmath3 particle ( approximately @xmath54 m ) emitted by radioactive decay . in nanothermites , a wimp will make one and only one cell explode , while other background particles will cause many cells to explode .",
    "in contrast , currently employed detectors with a physical granularity greater than approximately @xmath54 m will not be able to make this differentiation .",
    "4 .   directional detectors are possible , not with spherical nanoparticles , but with asymmetric detector designs that may be the study of future work . here",
    "the goal is to obtain the direction that the wimp came from ; for the case of forward scattering this is the same as the direction of the nuclear recoil .",
    "directionality would prove wimp detection with much less statistics , with only @xmath39 100 wimps required ; in addition one would learn about the structure of the dark matter halo . for directional sensitivity , the detector resolution must be smaller than the size of the track range of recoiling nuclei in order to measure the particles track . if the resolution is micron - sized , while the track length is nanometers , then of course the track will be impossible to follow .",
    "thus nano - scale detectors in principle have the capability to obtain nanometer track resolution .",
    "the spherical nanoparticles studied in this paper do not have directional sensitivity but other designs may .",
    "we take the rate of the thermite reaction @xmath55 at temperature @xmath56 to be represented by the arrhenius equation @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of interacting sites where a metal nucleus could chemically interact with the oxide , and @xmath28 is the arrhenius prefactor which is unique for each reaction but can be approximated by the vibrational frequency at the interface of the reactants .",
    "the vibrational frequency of a crystal is roughly @xmath59 hz .",
    "a survey of published values for the arrhenius prefactor @xmath28 experimentally measured for solid decomposition reactions showed a slight predominace of @xmath28 values between @xmath60 hz - @xmath59 hz@xcite . in this paper , we will approximate @xmath61 hz , but wish to note that differences in the arrhenius prefactor of order @xmath62 will not change our future results of the desired ignition and activation temperatures dramatically ( less than an order of magnitude ) due to the dominance of the exponential term .",
    "the arrhenius equation eq [ eq : arrhenius ] will allow us to calculate the probability of ignition of the nano - thermite following a transient temperature increase .",
    "now we turn to computing two important temperatures : one characterizing the barrier height of the phase transition and the other , the ignition temperature needed for a thermite reaction to take place .",
    "we will find that each of these temperatures must exceed a minimal value : the temperature characterizing the barrier height must be high enough to prevent spontaneous explosion even when no wimp has hit the detector , and the ignition temperature @xmath63 sets a minimum value needed in order for an explosion due to a wimp interaction to take place .",
    "these two conditions are important considerations when choosing a metal and oxide to make up the oxide - based thermite we will use in dm detectors . _ the first condition : _ the barrier height is characterized by the  activation energy \" + @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 is the boltzmann constant ) and its corresponding  activation temperature \" @xmath66 . as mentioned above , the barrier height is determined by requiring the thermite to be stable at room temperature @xmath67 k to thermal fluctuations for at least one year , i.e. , we require @xmath68 . even though the latter requirement is a conservative estimate",
    ", we will later show that a nano - thermite dark matter detector could meet such a constraining stipulation .",
    "in adapting eq.([eq : arrhenius ] ) to the requirement @xmath68 and computing the prefactor @xmath58 , we must add up all metal nuclei that could chemically interact with the metal - oxide and possibly produce an explosion within the entire detector .",
    "as mentioned previously , each cell has a radius @xmath69 nm . since the typical size for the lattice constant @xmath70 , which measures the separation between nuclei in the metal , is a few angstroms ( @xmath71 ) , the number of sites per nanoparticle of radius @xmath72 nm is @xmath73 thus , the total number of interacting sites @xmath74 found in a detector of total mass @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the density and volume of a single nanoparticle . to obtain a numerical value we will take @xmath79 kg . to be as conservative as possible",
    ", we will take the lowest metal density for all the elements we consider : aluminum .",
    "then we find @xmath80 and set @xmath81 in eq.([eq : arrhenius ] ) .",

    "nevertheless , our previous result is very robust because of the exponential nature of the arrhenius equation ( i.e. the same calculation of the activation temperature for any varying conditions under the assumed simple nanoparticle / oxide model will not vary much from this result eq@xmath85 $ ] ) .",
    "_ the second condition : _ now we can proceed to find the ignition temperature @xmath63 needed for a signal to be seen in our detector .",
    "we want to find the minimal temperature increase required by the energy deposited in a wimp interaction that can lead to an explosion .",

    "we may take the entire nanoparticle to be heated by some temperature @xmath87 .",
    "however , this value of the temperature does not last more than nanoseconds . in the next section",
    "we will solve the heat transfer equation to estimate the diffusion timescale of the heat out of the nanoparticle .",
    "shortly after a characteristic timescale known as the  conduction time \" @xmath88 , the metal nanoparticle is no longer hot enough to induce ignition .",
    "thus the appropriate timescale with which to multiply the rate in eq.([eq : arrhenius ] ) is this conduction time . to successfully have an exploding nanoparticle operating at some temperature @xmath87 , we thus require @xmath89 .",

    "this calculation was done in order to gain perspective under our assumed simple model into how the activation and ignition temperatures change as a function of the stability timescale of the detector .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the ignition temperature might be higher than the melting temperature of the metal and/or oxide .",

    "it is important to note that a cryogenic detector with a very low activation temperature would make the detector unstable at room temperature .",
    "thus , the materials would also need to be synthesized at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "neverthless , a thermite detector working at cryogenic temperatures will be stable even when considering very low activation temperatures ; on the order of @xmath230 k and @xmath231 k for detector temperatures of @xmath232 k ( liquid nitrogen ) and @xmath233 k ( liquid helium ) respectively . specifically , an al / cuo nano - thermite detector with an ignition temperature of @xmath234 k permits an energy threshold of 0.5 kev .",
    "only experiments would determine the actual ignition temperature of an al / cuo nanothermite .",
    "fortunately , the ignition temperature of thermites is proportional to the size of the nanoparticle ( i.e. a smaller nanoparticle has a lower ignition temperature ) , and other similar metals / oxide to al / cuo could be used in order to achieve a ignition temperature close to 50k@xcite .",
    "the latter consideration is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "any wimp detector is vulnerable to background coming from the cosmic rays or radiation from its components .",
    "cosmic rays can be minimized by putting the detector deep inside a mine underground .",
    "nevertheless , background will still be present due to radiation decay inside the detector , which are mostly due to natural impurities of the materials .",
    "the energy deposed per unit length of the background onto the detector can be calculated by using bethe - bloch theory .",
    "the bethe - bloch equation , in contrast to the lindhard equation , is used for relativistic ionizing particles like alphas and betas . the stopping power of alphas and betas",
    "can be found utilizing the astar and estar programs [ @xcite,@xcite ] .",
    "since the stopping power is linearly proportional to the density of the medium , we calculate the stopping power for alphas and betas moving in the densest material ( platinum ) common to both programs .",
    "excellent background rejection can be achieved because of the nanoscale granularity of the detector .",
    "single charged particles have a very long range .",
    "alpha particles , for example , have a much longer range in the detector than do recoiling nuclei , which can be used to get rid of background due to alphas . the energy loss of particles moving through the detector cells is @xmath235 . for helium @xmath236 = 4 ( near the end of the range the ion will pick up electrons and de / dx increases , but for the most part one can take @xmath237 for helium ) .",
    "z is much higher for nuclear recoils due to wimp interactions , causing faster energy loss ; thus the nuclei stop within a single cell .",
    "the wimp makes only one cell explode : the chain reaction initiated by one exploding metal nanoparticle is restricted to nanoparticles within only one cell , which is thermally isolated from neighboring cells by an insulating material . on the other hand ,",
    "the range of the @xmath3-particles , usually on the order of @xmath238 m or greater , is longer than size of one cell , and therefore make about 20 cells explode at once .",
    "thus the nanoscale granularity is key for background rejection .",
    "alpha particles produced in a radioactive decay usually have energies around 5 mev .",
    "utilizing astar , the stopping power of an alpha particle moving through platinum with an energy of 5 mev is @xmath239 kev/(10 nm ) .",
    "alphas have a large enough stopping power to produce a signal in a nano - thermite detector composed of a highly dense metal and energy threshold @xmath240 kev .",
    "fortunately , the range of alpha particles is much larger than that of heavy ions .",
    "rejection of alpha particle signals can be made due to the nanometer granularity of our detector .",
    "specifically , the typical range of a heavy ion is around 50 nm ; whereas , an alpha particle moving through a material would typically travel approximately @xmath241 m or more . as an illustrative example ,",
    "the stopping distance for a 5 mev alpha particle moving through al@xmath242o@xmath2 ( sio@xmath242 ) is 13.76 @xmath11 m ( 20 @xmath11 m ) .",
    "since each cell has a size of @xmath243 m , then a heavy ion would only explode 1 cell ; and an alpha particle would explode 20 or more cells .",
    "signals produced by alpha particles can be rejected by eliminating all exploded cell clusters .",
    "the energy range of beta particles is wide , ranging from a few kev to hundreds of mevs .",
    "this occurs , because the energy of the radioactive decay is usually shared between an electron and a neutrino .",
    "specifically , the biggest stopping power for a beta particle moving through platinum in the range of energies @xmath244 mev(found at energy @xmath245 mev ) is @xmath246 kev/(10 nm ) .",
    "a nano - thermite detector will produce a signal if one or more nanoparticles ignite and initiate a chain reaction within the cell .",
    "thus , if our detector has an energy threshold greater than @xmath247 kev , then beta particles will not produce a signal in our detector .",
    "it should be noted that the range of beta particles is much longer than alpha particles .",
    "thus , assuming that a beta particle can deposit enough energy to the nanoparticle to make an explosion and/or the detector has a lower energy threshold of @xmath248 kev ; then the same method of rejecting signals originated by alpha particles could be used to identify explosions caused by beta particles .",
    "the signal produced by a beta particle ( if any ) would explode many cells , much more than alpha particles .",
    "this result would hold true also if we considered other metals with a lighter density , since the quoted stopping power is from one of the densest metals in the periodic table .",
    "another source of background are gammas , which are highly energetic photons .",
    "even though gamma particles are electrically neutral , they can create photo electrons through the photoelectric effect and the compton effect .",
    "either of those interactions will eject an electron at relativistic speeds , turning it into a beta particle that will ionize many more atoms .",
    "typical energies for gamma particles produced in a radioactive decay range from a few hundred kev to 10 mev .",
    "estar can be employed to learn the behavior of the electrons produced by the interaction of an atom with a gamma ray . by the same argument",
    "found for beta particles above , gammas will not produce a signal in a nano - thermite wimp detector with energy threshold @xmath249 kev .",
    "the nanometer granularity of the nano - thermite detector is such that background from beta and gamma particles do not produce any signal ( assuming an @xmath249 kev ) , and signals originated by alpha particles can be discarded due to the large number of cells exploded .",
    "we have studied the ignition properties of nanoscale explosives as a novel type of dark matter detector .",
    "other design concepts may be employed for the nanothermite dark matter detector , which could obtain lower energy thresholds and/or measure directionality of the recoiling nucleus sourced by a wimp / nucleus interaction .",
    "we focused on two - component nanothermite explosives consisting of a metal and an oxide . as a specific example",
    ", we considered metal nanoparticles of 5 nm radius embedded in a gel of oxide , with millions of these nanoparticles constituting one  cell \" isolated from other cells . a large number of cells adds up to a total of 1 kg detector mass . a wimp striking a metal nucleus in the nanoparticle , deposits energy that may be enough to initiate a reaction at the interface between the two layers .",
    "we calculated the temperature increase of a metal nanoparticle due to a wimp interaction and compared it to the ignition temperature required for the nanoparticle to explode .",
    "we computed the range of the nuclear recoil using the lindhard formula ; if the recoiling nucleus did not stop inside the nanoparticle , we considered only the fraction of the energy that was deposited inside the metal nanoparticle itself .",
    "this energy fraction was then converted to a temperature increase .",
    "we needed to know how long the nanoparticle remained hot in order to determine whether an explosion was set off .",
    "this timescale was obtained from the heat transfer equation .",
    "all assumptions made during the calculations were chosen in the spirit of being as conservative as possible .",
    "we then compared the temperature increase to the ignition temperature required to set off a nanothermite explosion .",
    "this ignition temperature varies for different thermite materials , and was computed by requiring two conditions to be met : ( i ) for each of the thermites we considered , there should be no spontaneous combustion of any of the metal nanoparticles for at least a time period of one year , and ( ii ) the temperature increase from a wimp interaction must be sufficiently high to overcome an activation barrier and allow the thermite reaction to proceed .",
    "we searched through a variety of thermite materials to find those whose temperature increases from wimp interactions would exceed their ignition temperatures for an explosion .",
    "we found aluminum , ytterbium , thallium and tantalum to be particularly suited to discover wimps via the explosion they would induce .",
    "we note that our model assumed that both the metal and oxide interact as solids .",
    "however , if the metal changes physical state into a gas due to a correspondingly high temperature increase , then the nano - thermite reaction rate may drastically increase .",
    "excellent background rejection can be achieved because of the nanoscale granularity of the detector .",
    "the wimp makes only one cell explode : the chain reaction initiated by one exploding metal nanoparticle is restricted to nanoparticles within only one cell , which is thermally isolated from neighboring cells by an insulating material .",
    "the range of the @xmath3-particles on the other hand is longer than size of one cell , on the order of @xmath54 m , and therefore makes approximately 20 or more cells explode at once .",
    "thus the nanoscale granularity is key for background rejection .",
    "betas and gammas , on the other hand , rarely set off an explosion at all .",
    "we found a number of thermites that would serve as efficient wimp detectors . using a single model",
    ", we found that if the detector operates at room temperature , wimps with masses above 100 gev ( or for some materials above 1 tev ) could be detected ; they deposit enough energy ( @xmath010 kev ) to cause an explosion .",
    "when operating cryogenically at liquid nitrogen or liquid helium temperatures , the nano explosive wimp detector can detect energy deposits as low as 0.5 kev , making the nano explosive detector sensitive to very light @xmath110 gev wimps .",
    "even with the conservative model presented in this paper , our calculations suggest that oxide - based nano - thermites would work as a dark matter detector .",
    "we look forward to experiments which will establish accurately the minimal energy deposition by a recoiling nucleus necessary for a nano - thermite combustion .",
