    "the theory of frster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) between two chromophores ( molecules , ions ) with dipole - allowed optical transitions ,  @xcite and its generalization by dexter  @xcite to forbidden optical transitions and exchange interactions between the chromophores , already have a history of more than 50 years .",
    "this celebrated theory gives an excellent description of transfer rates for distant chromophores with rather broad spectral lines .",
    "@xcite it describes these rates in terms of the overlap integral of experimentally measured optical absorption and luminescence spectra , which makes it of great utility . with minor reformulations , the concept of fret",
    "may also be applied successfully to the description of nonradiative transitions in ions and molecules in condensed phases,@xcite as well as to energy transfer in the presence of a nonstationary bath relaxation.@xcite finally , it has been shown that the frster theory also explains the efficient long - range energy transfer in assemblies of closely packed cdse quantum dots  @xcite and cdse nanocrystals assembled with molecular wires,@xcite systems of possible use for quantum computation.@xcite    in spite of its great success , it has been recognized since the 1980 s that in certain situations standard fret theory is not applicable . in particular , this holds for chromophores with narrow spectral lines and a small spectral overlap , such as rare - earth ions embedded in a crystalline or glassy host.@xcite more recently another important situation in which fret theory may break down has been emphasized , namely energy transfer between two systems that both contain many interacting chromophores .",
    "this problem has drawn particular attention in the context of excitation energy transfer from the b800 to the b850 ring of the photosynthetic antenna system lh2 .",
    "the first complication when dealing with systems of strongly interacting chromophores is that their excited states are excitons , consisting of a coherent superposition of the excited states of many molecules . due to their spatial extent , which may easily exceed the separation between the two systems , the effective interaction between an exciton state on the donor system and one on the acceptor system",
    "can not be modelled as the interaction between the transition dipoles of both states . as a result ,",
    "excitation energy transfer may occur from or towards a dipole forbidden ( optically dark ) exciton state , implying that a description of the energy transfer in terms of overlap integrals of optical spectra no longer holds .",
    "this breakdown of the point - dipole approximation was first pointed out by sumi and coworkers.@xcite treating the electronic coupling between both rings in lh2 as a perturbation , they derived a transfer rate between the rings that strongly differed in magnitude from the frster result and which was in good agreement with experiment .",
    "@xcite    it should be noted that lh2 is a rather special case of transfer between two aggregates .",
    "the reason is that the molecules in the b800 ring are weakly coupled to each other .",
    "thus , the b800 excitations are almost monomeric  @xcite and they occur in a narrow band just above the upper edge of the b850 band and far ( 965 @xmath0 ) away from the optically dominant bottom of that band .",
    "@xcite moreover , the intermolecular interactions between both rings are weak , in the order of 20 @xmath0.@xcite given these special circumstances , it is not surprising that the perturbative treatment of the inter - aggregate ( inter - ring ) interactions gives good results .",
    "in many cases of closely separated aggregates , however , a perturbative treatment of the interaction that causes energy transfer between them will not be valid .",
    "an interesting example is the case of nanotubular carbocyanine j - aggregates that have recently been developed by dhne and coworkers  @xcite and which have been suggested as building blocks for synthetic light - harvesting systems .",
    "these aggregates consist of two walls , which are only a few nanometers apart .",
    "each wall is responsible for the formation of an exciton band ; even though their optically dominant lower edges are separated by a few hundred @xmath0 , the two bands overlap over a large energy range ( @xmath1 2000 @xmath0 ) .",
    "@xcite using fluorescence and pump - probe experiments , fast excitation energy transfer between both walls has been observed.@xcite the strong overlap of the exciton bands makes it doubtful that a perturbative treatment of the interwall interactions holds for this example : ( dark ) states inside both bands may be close to degenerate , thus falling outside the perturbative regime .",
    "this observation also holds for the example of energy transfer between two linear pseudo - isocyanine aggregates studied by kobayashi and coworkers .",
    "@xcite like sumi and coworkers , these authors focused on a breakdown of the dipole approximation ; they did not consider the limitations of a perturbative treatment .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study theoretically the energy transfer between two molecular j - aggregates carrying frenkel excitons .",
    "we will be inspired by the example of the double - wall cyanine tubes , where the bottoms of both exciton bands occur at different energies , but their central parts overlap . to keep the problem computationally tractable ,",
    "we will consider two interacting linear j - aggregates with different bandwidths , leading to a crossing of both bands in their center .",
    "the chain with the higher ( lower ) band bottom is considered the donor ( acceptor ) . using this generic model",
    ", we will investigate the breakdown of the perturbative approach by comparing to an exact treatment , in which both aggregates form one exciton system and the energy transfer is associated with phonon - assisted relaxation within this system .",
    "we thus find that the crossover between the weak coupling ( perturbative ) and strong coupling ( nonperturbative ) situations is determined by the separation between both aggregates as well as by the temperature .",
    "another important issue which we address is that fast intraband relaxation ( thermalization ) between visible and dark exciton states may obscure the observation of the actual energy transfer process and thereby plays a crucial role in the proper definition of the transfer rate as extracted from experiment . as a consequence , also the initial excitation conditions strongly affect the possibility to measure the transfer rate .",
    "this key role of intraband relaxation in the process of energy transfer between excitonic systems seems to have gone unnoticed thus far .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we first present our model of two homogeneous linear j - aggregates , interacting with each other as well as with a vibrational bath .",
    "we then introduce the general issue of perturbative versus nonperturbative treatment of interchain interactions by considering the various dynamic processes that can occur in and between weakly coupled or strongly mixed exciton bands .",
    "the perturbative approach is worked out in more detail in sec .",
    "[ perturbative ] , where we derive the general expression for the one - phonon assisted transfer rate between any two exciton states located on different chains . in sec .",
    "[ exact ] we develop the approach for the case of strong interchain coupling ( nonperturbative case ) .",
    "results of numerical simulations of the fluorescence kinetics in both the perturbative and the nonperturbative approach are presented in sec .  [ discussion ] and are used to study the validity of the former as well as the best way to extract the transfer rate from experiment .",
    "both the temperature and distance dependence of the transfer dynamics are addressed and distinction is made between resonant and off - resonant initial excitation of the donor . a comparison to standard fret theory",
    "is made as well .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ summary ] we summarize .",
    "we consider two parallel linear chains each consisting of @xmath2 equidistant two - level chromophores , with their transition dipoles aligned to the chains ( see fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ) .",
    "the lattice spacing within each chain is denoted @xmath3 , while the distance between the chains is @xmath4 .",
    "one of the chains will be referred to as the donor ( d ) , the other as the acceptor ( a ) ( see below ) .",
    "we will assume that both chains are homogeneous and we will impose periodic boundary conditions in the chain direction ( the formalism may easily be extended to account for disorder and open boundary conditions ) .",
    "the chromophores building up the d chain are different from those of the a chain ; in particular , we will assume that the transition energies and dipoles of the individual chromophores within the d chain all have the values @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , while in the a chain they take the values @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we will account for the dipole - dipole interactions between all chromophores in both chains and also include in the model a coupling of the electronic excitations to a bath of vibrations .",
    "the latter coupling is derived from the first - order change of the chromophores transition energies caused by nuclear displacements in the environment . in the site representation ,",
    "the resulting hamiltonian of system and bath reads @xmath9 with    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the electronic ( exciton ) hamiltonians for the isolated donor and acceptor chains , respectively , while @xmath18 is the electronic interaction between both chains , composed of all dipole - dipole interactions between molecules of one chain and the other . in these terms",
    ", @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) denotes the state in which the @xmath21th ( @xmath22 ) chromophore of the donor ( acceptor ) chain is excited and all the other chromophores are in the ground state .",
    "furthermore , the hopping integrals @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the various dipole - dipole interaction matrix elements between chromophores of the same or different chains . for the geometry considered here , we have @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29/ \\big [ 1 + ( n - m)^2h^2/d^2 \\big]^{5/2}$ ] , with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .    @xmath33 describes the vibrational modes of the host , labeled @xmath34 and with the energy spectrum @xmath35 ( we set @xmath36 ) . the operator @xmath37 annihilates a vibrational quantum in mode @xmath34 .",
    "finally , @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the operators of the exciton - bath coupling of the donor and acceptor , respectively , where the quantities @xmath40 and @xmath41 indicate their strength .",
    "we do not provide explicit expressions for these quantities ; rather we will consider them on a phenomenological basis . specifically , realizing that in most experimental studies of aggregates the host is strongly disordered , we will treat these strengths as stochastic variables with correlation properties :    [ < correlationsvdva > ] @xmath42 @xmath43",
    "@xmath44    these relations imply that the surroundings of different chromophores are not correlated .",
    "we now turn to a general discussion of perturbative versus nonperturbative approach to describe the excitation energy transfer between both chains . throughout this paper",
    ", we will assume that the exciton - phonon coupling is weak compared to the intrachain dipole - dipole interactions , in the sense that the coherence length of the excitons within each chain is not limited by the coupling to the bath .",
    "in that case , the bloch eigenstates of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are a good starting point for our considerations and the main role of the bath is to make up for energy differences in possible intraband energy relaxation .",

    "we see two exciton bands that cross at their center .",
    "the bottom of each band occurs at @xmath58 , which is the superradiant state that contains all oscillator strength to the ground state ; all other exciton states are optically forbidden .",

    "as long as the interactions @xmath68 are weak ( large separation @xmath4 ) , it seems reasonable to apply the usual perturbative approach to them , using the bands of the isolated donor and acceptor chains as starting point .",

    "[ perturbative ] , where we also will treat the exciton - phonon interactions perturbatively . in this approach , the rate of energy transfer between an arbitrary donor state and acceptor state is calculated using second order perturbation theory , involving two steps : ( i ) the excitation is transferred from the donor to the acceptor .",

    "we notice that aside from energy transfer between both chains , the interactions with the phonon bath also give rise to relaxation of the exciton states within both bands ; details of this process are studied in ref .  .",
    "if we focus on the optically dominant bottom states of both bands , it seems that the perturbative treatment of the interchain interactions is valid as long as @xmath69 . generally speaking ,",
    "this criterion is not sufficient , however .",
    "depending on temperature and initial excitation condition , the transfer process may involve the optically forbidden states higher in the exciton bands . as near the band center",

    "these states in the vicinity of the band edges are only weakly coupled ( @xmath181 is rather small , see sec .",
    "[ strategy ] ) .",
    "this explains why the difference between the perturbative and nonperturbative results quickly vanishes for @xmath182 .",
    "this difference only is considerable for @xmath183 , because the interchain interactions then quickly grow ( @xmath184 ) , increasing the band mixing even for the band edge states .    upon increasing the temperature",
    ", the initial population will spread to higher @xmath50 states in the donor band . for these states ,",
    "the band mixing becomes increasingly more important , even for growing values of the distance @xmath4 .",
    "this effect finds its origin in the fact that the energy separation between the isolated donor and acceptor bands decreases with growing @xmath50 , while the interchain interaction @xmath185 grows ( cf .",
    "[ fig : bands ] ) .",
    "this explains why the range of @xmath4 over which the perturbative approach fails , increases with growing temperature .",
    "it is of interest also to compare the above derived energy transfer rates with frster s formula , which is obtained from eq .",

    "[ fig : forster ] , together with @xmath176 and @xmath177 at @xmath178 .",
    "clearly , the frster result gives an enormous overestimation of the exact as well as the perturbative rate for interchain distances smaller than roughly the chain length .",
    "this is not surprising , because at distances small compared to the chain size , the @xmath188 defined below eq .",
    "( [ da - excitonic ] ) , does not reduce to the interaction between the excitons transition dipoles .      in the above",
    ", we characterized the excitation energy transfer by a single rate , which is possible if we assume fast equilibration inside the donor and the acceptor band , and neglect the back transfer from the acceptor to the donor .",
    "in general , one can not rely on these assumptions . as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ strategy ] ( also see sec .  [ exact ] ) , the most straightforward way to characterize the energy transfer between donor and acceptor in experiment is to follow the fluorescence kinetics of both subsystems .",
    "in this section , we will use this approach . in all cases ,",
    "the calculations were done using the nonperturbative method , i.e. , accounting for band mixing and for relaxation within and between the mixed bands .",
    "we will not assume a priori that equilibration takes place on a timescale shorter than the one for energy transfer .",
    "as only the bottom ( @xmath58 ) states of the mixed bands have oscillator strength , both the absorption and the fluorescence spectrum consist of a single @xmath189-peak .",
    "thus , the total donor and acceptor fluorescence intensity as a function of time are given by @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively .",
    "these are the quantities that will be analyzed in the following and related to the intraband relaxation and excatitation energy transfer .",
    "we first study the fluorescence kinetics for resonant excitation , i.e. , assuming that initially the superradiant state @xmath179 of the donor band is excited by the pump . following this excitation ,",
    "the population of this state has two channels to relax , namely scattering to higher states in the donor band ( intraband relaxation ) or scattering to the acceptor band ( energy transfer ) .",
    "once transferred to the acceptor band , the excitation may undergo relaxation within that band , or it may transfer back to the donor .",
    "figure  [ fig : donorkinetics ] shows the donor fluorescence kinetics @xmath192 resulting from the interplay of these processes at different temperatures and interchain distances , calculated by solving eq .",
    "( [ pnu ] ) with the above initial condition . in doing so",
    ", we neglected the radiative decay rates @xmath193 of the exciton states , assuming this relaxation channel to be much slower than all the others . as a result , at nonzero temperatures",
    ", @xmath194 eventually reaches a finite value , which is in accordance with the boltzmann equilibrium over donor and acceptor states .",
    "we notice that even the neglect of the superradiant emission rate for chains of the order of @xmath195 molecules ( @xmath196ps lifetime ) does not limit the validity of the results presented in this section .",
    "typical values for @xmath197 are in the @xmath198fs time scale ,  @xcite so that at all times considered in figs .",
    "[ fig : donorkinetics ] and [ fig : res - offres ] the radiative decay indeed has a negligible effect .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : donorkinetics ] ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) one can distinguish two stages in the donor fluorescence kinetics , prior to reaching the boltzmann equilibrium .",
    "these stages are characterized by different time scales . the first stage , indicated by i in fig .",
    "[ fig : donorkinetics](c ) , is a fast intraband relaxation . here",
    ", the initially created population of the superradiant donor state @xmath199 rapidly scatters to the higher - lying dark states @xmath200 , resulting in a fast decay of the donor s fluorescence intensity .",
    "obviously , this process gets more pronounced with increasing temperature .",
    "the second stage , indicated by ii in fig .",
    "[ fig : donorkinetics](c ) , is noticeably slower .",
    "this stage is associated with the interband relaxation , i.e. , with the energy transfer between the donor and acceptor bands .",
    "we note that at @xmath178 the upward intraband relaxation is absent and the monoexponential fluorescence decay directly reflects the transfer rate calculated through eq .",
    "( [ w+to- ] ) at @xmath178 .",
    "as is seen , stages i and ii are easily separated as long as the interchain distance @xmath201 ; it is then possible to determine a meaningful effective energy transfer rate from the stage ii decay of the donor fluorescence . at @xmath180 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : donorkinetics](a ) ] , it is hardly possible to distinguish the two stages ; the fluorescence kinetics only exhibits a fast initial drop , almost directly followed by the boltzmann plateau .",
    "the reason is that for @xmath202 , the bare donor and acceptor bands are strongly mixed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pert - nonpert ] ) . as a result , the intra- and interband relaxation rates are of the same order , making it impossible to distinguish their signatures in the fluorescence kinetics .",
    "we also observe that the intraband relaxation is much more sensitive to changing the temperature than the energy transfer process .",
    "this is due to the fact that this relaxation is directly sensitive to the number of thermally accessible dark states in the donor band .    the above statement that the stage ii part of the donor kinetics indeed yields a meaningful measure for the energy transfer rate to the acceptor , is corroborated by fig .",
    "[ fig : res - offres ] , in which for three different separations at two different temperatures the donor fluorescence kinetics is plotted again ( thick solid curves ) , and is compared to the monoexponential decay obtained through eq .",
    "( [ w+to- ] ) at the same temperature ( dashed line ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig : res - offres](b , c , e , f ) stage ii can be distinguished and this part of the kinetics is ( roughly ) parallel to the monoexponential curve .",
    "the agreement deteriorates with decreasing separation @xmath4 and with growing temperature . in panel ( e ) stage ii already is rather hard to see and the agreement with the monoexponential curve is only fair . in panels ( a ) and ( d ) , stage ii can not be distinguished , and no part of the fluorescence kinetics shows a reasonable agreement with the monoexponential decay line .    from the above it may be concluded that in the case of strong interchain coupling , under conditions of resonant excitation , the kinetics of the donor fluorescence is not a good tool to determine the energy transfer rate .",
    "one may expect that under these conditions , the acceptor fluorescence yields a better tool , because this quantity is influenced less directly by the upward relaxation within the donor band .",
    "for this reason , we also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : res - offres ] the acceptor fluorescence as a function of time ( thick dash - dotted curves ) .",
    "these curves represent @xmath203 $ ] , where @xmath204 equals the thermal equilibrium value .",
    "we observe that even in the case of strong coupling and high temperature , the acceptor fluorescence indeed seems to be affected less by the initial thermal relaxation part and more directly reflects the energy transfer rate as calculated assuming equilibration ( dashed lines ) .",
    "we next turn to the case of off - resonant excitation . to this end",
    "we also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : res - offres ] ( thin solid curve ) the donor fluorescence after the system has been brought ( artificially ) in the initial state with @xmath205 and @xmath206 , i.e. , the center state of the donor band is excited .",
    "as for the case of resonant excitation , we observe that at low temperatures and ( or ) large interchain separations , the kinetics exhibits two stages prior to reaching the boltzmann plateau . the first stage , intraband relaxation , now manifests itself through the increase of the donor fluorescence from its initial value zero , because the donor population needs time to reach the superradiant bottom state of the donor band .",
    "we note that , in spite of the many relaxation steps needed to reach the bottom , for low temperatures this first stage occurs on the same timescale or even faster than for the case of resonant excitation . as a result",
    "the stage ii process , related to the energy transfer , reflects the same timescale as for resonant excitation .",
    "by contrast , at higher temperatures the distinction between the first and second stage of the kinetics is less clear : there is a more gradual change between the two , which also creates the impression of a longer timescale for the intraband relaxation .",
    "we explain this as follows . as near the band center",
    "the mixing of donor and acceptor bands is very strong , the intraband and interband relaxation there happen at the same timescale . as a result",
    ", off - resonant excitation is followed by very fast distribution of the excitation over donor and acceptor bands , in both of which the population relaxes to the bottom .",
    "thus , as opposed to the case of resonant excitation , the energy transfer problem at the bottom of the band takes place in a situation where a large part of the population already has ended up in the acceptor band .",
    "in this situation , the back - transfer from the acceptor to the donor , which takes place at temperatures of the order of the band edge detuning @xmath60 , feeds the donor fluorescence after the initial relaxation , which prolongs the time during which the donor fluorescence increases and slows down its overall kinetics . comparing to the dashed lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : res - offres ] , we observe that at the higher temperatures no part of the kinetics curve for off - resonant excitation reflects the energy transfer rate calculated through eq .",
    "( [ w+to- ] ) .",
    "thus , at high temperatures ( comparable to @xmath60 or higher ) off - resonantly excited donor fluorescence seems not to be a good ruler for the energy transfer rate . at low temperatures , this technique is more useful and then yields the same transfer rate as donor or acceptor fluorescence after resonant excitation of the donor .    without showing details ,",
    "we mention that in the case of off - resonant excitation also the kinetics of the acceptor fluorescence suffers from the interplay between intraband and interband transfer and therefore also does not yield a proper tool for measuring the energy transfer rate .",
    "we theoretically studied the excitation energy transfer between two linear chains of dye molecules , whose primary excitations are frenkel excitons .",
    "the superradiant band bottoms of both chains were detuned by a value @xmath60 ; the chain with the higher ( lower ) band bottom was considered the energy donor ( acceptor ) .",
    "in addition to electronic interchain interactions , our theory accounts for weak exciton - phonon coupling .",
    "two methods were investigated . in the perturbative method , we used the common approximation of treating the interchain interactions as a perturbation , which also is the basis for the standard fret formalism . in the nonperturbative approach",
    ", we allowed for mixing of the donor and acceptor exciton bands and considered the various phonon - induced relaxation mechanisms in and between these bands to describe the energy transfer process .    using the perturbative approach ,",
    "we have confirmed that energy transfer between multichromophoric systems can occur from and towards dipole forbidden states .",
    "we have focused , however , on two other aspects specific to multichromophoric systems , namely the effects of band mixing and intraband relaxation on the energy transfer .",
    "the first has been studied by comparison of the perturbative and the nonperterbative method .",
    "not surprisingly , we find that the perturbative approach looses its validity when the interchain distance decreases ( and the interchain interactions grow ) .",
    "the perturbative result for the energy transfer rate then strongly overestimates the exact one that accounts for band mixing .",
    "the distance at which the perturbation theory breaks down increases with temperature , because the effect of band mixing is larger for the states inside the bands , which get populated upon heating .",
    "we also compared our results to standard fret theory , which turns out to lose its validity as soon as the interchain separation falls below the chain length ( or exciton delocalization length , in case one considers disordered chains ) .    from our study",
    "it turns out that the process of energy transfer between multichromophoric systems is strongly affected by intraband relaxation .",
    "this is most obvious in the kinetics of the donor and acceptor fluorescence after pulsed excitation .",
    "as these quantities are natural choices for probing energy transfer , it is important to realize that this kinetics does not only reflect the actual transfer process of interest , but also is affected by thermal relaxation inside the donor and acceptor bands",
    ". only if both processes can be separated , due to different time scales , one may extract the energy transfer rate from such experiments .",
    "our results suggest that the best way of determining the transfer rate between two j - aggregates is to measure the fluorescence kinetics of the acceptor s j - band after resonant excitation of the donor band . under these conditions",
    ", the approach of the acceptor s fluorescence intensity grows towards its equilibrium value almost mono - exponentially , allowing for a meaningful definition of the transfer rate .",
    "we also found that the thus extracted rate agrees well with the transfer rate obtained when assuming equilibration over the donor band .",
    "if , due to relaxation to the ground state , measuring the acceptor s equilibrium fluorescence intensity turns out to be a problem , one may also resort to analyzing the decay of the time - derivative of this intensity .",
    "the first component of that decay should then reflect the transfer rate , while the second reflects the relaxation to the ground state .",
    "we note that throughout this paper we have neglected the homogeneous linewidths @xmath207 of the individual exciton transitions . within our model ,",
    "these widths result from exciton - phonon scattering .",
    "@xcite it may be estimated that within the context of excitation energy transfer these widths may indeed be neglected ( i.e. , @xmath208 ) as long as @xmath209 .",
    "the results of this paper were derived using the simplest possible model of two interacting homogeneous chains with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the same issues of band mixing and intraband relaxation will play an important role for more general systems , where one allows for energy and interaction disorder and ( or ) for different geometries .",
    "in fact , all expressions in secs .",
