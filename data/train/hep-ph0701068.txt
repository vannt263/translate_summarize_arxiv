    "recently neutrino physics has given us many surprises with strong evidences for flavor neutrino conversion to another type of neutrinos .",
    "analysis of data from solar , atmospheric and reactor neutrinos have shown us that no other mechanism can explain all the data , unless you have massive neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "these experiments are the first strong evidence for non - conservation of family lepton number and this may indicate that new symmetries and interactions are the source of this phenomena .",
    "experimental evidences of massive neutrinos imply that the minimal standard model ( sm ) is no longer correct .",
    "the simplest extension would be the inclusion of right - handed sterile neutrinos , what would allow dirac mass terms for neutrinos . despite its simplicity , this approach does not help us to understand the neutrino mass scale or predict the neutrino masses . due to the large gap between neutrino mass scales and the other sm scales , several mechanisms have been suggested to generate neutrino masses , relating this mass scale to new physics . in many of these models",
    "the masses are of the majorana type or a mix between majorana and dirac types , what implies non - conservation of lepton number .",
    "as it s well known , lepton number is an accidental global symmetry ( @xmath4 ) of the standard model .",
    "so , if the neutrino mass matrix includes majorana terms , lepton number is broken either explicitly or spontaneously .",
    "if lepton number ( @xmath5 ) is indeed a global symmetry , its spontaneous breaking will generate a goldstone boson , usually called majoron  @xcite . in this case the breaking of @xmath5 sets a new scale and requires a scalar which carries lepton number and acquires a non - null vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "several extensions of the sm allow spontaneous @xmath5 breaking and predicts the existence of the majoron . however , the simplest extensions ( with a triplet scalar ) are excluded due to the experimental results of lep on the @xmath6 invisible decay .    another important class of models which predicts the existence of majorons are supersymmetric extensions of the standard model with spontaneous r parity breaking . in these models ,",
    "the introduction of anti - neutrino superfields ( @xmath7 ) and new singlet superfields ( @xmath8 ) ( which contain neutral leptonic scalars ) , allows spontaneous breaking of lepton number  @xcite . in almost all of these models",
    "the majoron will be the imaginary part of some linear combination of sneutrinos , the scalar component of the super higgs fields ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and the @xmath8 superfields .",
    "therefore we may safely assume as a model - independent coupling the following interaction term between @xmath11 and @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a general complex coupling matrix in the flavor basis . because in most models @xmath11 is basically a singlet ( avoiding the constraints imposed by the lep results ) , the above couplings are usually the most relevant ones to phenomenological analysis ( at least at low energies ) . in most models we must also include couplings between neutrinos and a new light scalar ( that we call @xmath15 ) with the same couplings as @xmath11 : @xmath16 usually neutrino masses and mixings will depend on the vevs associated to the spontaneous breaking of @xmath5 and the matrix @xmath17 . in this context , knowledge of the couplings between neutrinos and majorons may help us to understand the neutrino mass scale .",
    "however , this relation is very model dependent and may be very hard to realize in practice . trying to make our results as model independent as possible",
    ", we will make no assumptions on @xmath14 and present our results with and without the existence of the massive scalar @xmath15 . nevertheless , assuming majorana neutrinos ( what is reasonable since lepton number is violated ) , bounds on @xmath18 may be transformed to the mass basis through the relation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the neutrino - majoron coupling matrix in the basis where the neutrino mass matrix is diagonal ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 rotates the mass eigenstates to the flavor eigentates ( see section [ iid ] ) .",
    "majoron models can be interesting from the cosmological point of view because they can affect bounds to neutrino masses from large scale structure  @xcite .",
    "neutrinos coming from astrophysical sources can also be significantly affected by fast decays , where the only mechanism not yet eliminated is due to neutrinos coupling to majorons .",
    "this can affect the very high energy region , strongly changing the flavor ratios between different neutrino species  @xcite or the lower energy region , as supernova neutrinos  @xcite .",
    ".some of the previous bounds on neutrino - majoron couplings from different sources . in the last two columns",
    "are shown the process used to constraint the couplings and the respective references . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     because the spectrum is more sensitive to changes in the cubic term ( or the @xmath23 parameter ) , we consider the majoron contributions to @xmath23 : @xmath24 using the chi - square method at 90% c.l .",
    "we obtain : @xmath25    as can be seen in figure [ enspec ] , the majoron main modifications to the spectra occurs in the neutrino spectrum , which has been measured by the karmen experiment  @xcite",
    ". however , due to experimental uncertainties , the resulting bounds on @xmath17 are too weak in this case .    summarizing ,",
    "the strongest bounds are given in the table [ finalres ] , where we compared the previous limits and the newest constraints obtained here .",
    "all the results obtained so far are written in the flavor basis . however , in many cases , theoretical analysis are easier on the mass basis .",
    "we have two possible cases : dirac or majorana neutrinos . in this section",
    "we assume majorana neutrinos to transform our bounds to the the mass basis .",
    "we can translate the previous results to the mass basis using the transformation matrix @xmath22  @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath21 and for a given mass @xmath34 , we can written all other masses as a function of @xmath34 and the squared mass differences as follows @xmath35 although the mass differences and angles have been measured experimentally  @xcite , we have no information on the majorana phases @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .     plane .",
    "we show the curves for @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "these curves are for @xmath42 , non - zero values of @xmath43 are more restrictive . ]    to calculate the bounds in the mass basis , we will use the transformation rule for majorana neutrinos @xmath44 where g is the neutrino - majoron coupling matrix in the flavor basis and g is the neutrino - majoron coupling matrix in the mass basis .    although it is not valid in general , many models  @xcite have the following property ( at least in some limit ) @xmath45    following  @xcite , we calculate the allowed region for different values of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 and then choose the union of these regions as the final result , valid for any value of the phases , as shown in figure [ massbounds ] .",
    "using three different techniques we were able to constraint the neutrino - majoron couplings .",
    "the strongest constraints are shown in table [ finalres ] . considering only the limits from meson",
    "decays we improve by one order of magnitude the previous limits on @xmath46 and @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "although the best constraints were obtained from meson decay rates , we have shown that independent bounds can also be obtained from @xmath48 and @xmath49 decays .",
    "the latter one being the best to constraint the @xmath50 elements .",
    "we stress that the bounds on @xmath50 shown in table [ finalres ] is probably the first model - independent constraint for this parameter .",
    "the third alternative used was an analysis of the spectrum of muon decay . despite its potential for constraining the @xmath51 elements , the experimental values are not precise enough to make such an analysis useful .",
    "our best constraints are latexmath:[$"
