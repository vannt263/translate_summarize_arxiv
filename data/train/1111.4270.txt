    "three years after the launch of the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ , pulsations have been detected with its large area telescope ( lat ) from at least 100 rotation - powered neutron stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we included all point sources in a preliminary version of the 2fgl catalog @xcite within @xmath44 of the pulsar , as the broad point - spread function ( psf ) at low energy allows sources away from the aperture boundary to contribute to the observed counts .",
    "identified pulsars were modeled with a power law with exponential cutoff , @xmath45 . in the fits reported below , we varied all parameters for sources within @xmath46 of the aperture , while sources outside of the aperture were held fixed at the catalog values .",

    "@xcite noted that the profiles of pulsars with high @xmath61 share many common features .",
    "in particular , the profiles with two components generally show ( i ) two components with equal width , ( ii ) the trailing component stronger than the leading component , ( iii ) close to 100% linear polarization , ( iv ) significant circular polarization under the trailing component , and ( v ) flat position angle swings which appear to steepen at the far trailing edge of the profile .",
    "the profile of  conforms in some ways to these generalizations .",
    "the profile is symmetrical with the trailing edge brighter .",
    "the pa swing is remarkably flat with a hint of steepening at the trailing edge .",
    "however , although the leading component is highly polarized , the trailing edge is not , unlike the majority of the high @xmath61 pulsars .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the transition between pulsars with low linear polarization and those which are highly polarized occurs at @xmath62 .",
    "could be an example of a pulsar in transition from high to low polarization .",
    "the interpretation of these profiles by @xcite was that the magnetic pole crossing occurs at the ( symmetry ) center of the profile .",

    "this may also be the case in .",
    "if we assume that the inflexion point of the pa swing is the rise in the pa curve some @xmath63 after the profile center in figure  [ fig : pol ] , this implies an emission height of @xmath64 km ( close to 10% of the light cylinder ) , similar to those seen in other high @xmath61 pulsars .",
    "we also note that a height of @xmath64 km would in turn imply an overall pulse width of some @xmath65 , similar to the observed value .",
    "this further suggests that the inclination between the magnetic and rotation axes can not be too far from orthogonal .",
    "we can use the gamma - ray light curve and polarimetric measurements to test the predictions of magnetosphere beaming models .",
    "such tests are most constraining when the magnetic inclination angle @xmath66 and the viewing angle @xmath67 are well determined .",
    "the polarization data provide some geometrical constraints .",
    "since the lower frequency data may be affected by interstellar scattering , our primary constraints are based on the 1.5ghz data .",

    "also , the background is slightly over - predicted by the sg model , especially for the parameters consistent with the polarization curves .    none of these ( og , sl , sg ) gamma - ray light curve fits are particularly consistent with our inferences from the radio profile and polarimetric constraints .",
    "for instance , the latter suggest a nearly orthogonal rotator ( section  [ sec : simon ] ) , for which there are no good gamma - ray light curve fits . however , the polarimetric data provide limited constraints , owing to the small range of pulse longitude for which they are obtained , and our inferences rely on some assumptions . as for the gamma - ray fits ,",

    "many more galactic plane unidentified lat sources have been searched for radio pulsars than the three mentioned here .",
    "this work is being done at the gbt , parkes , nanay , gmrt , and effelsberg telescopes by members of the  pulsar search consortium , and includes searches of all sources that have pulsar characteristics at all galactic latitudes .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  and . while a detailed population analysis will have to wait for the publication of all the completed searches , the lone example of  already stands out",
    "why have more radio pulsars not been detected among the unidentified galactic plane lat sources ?",
    "a point related to this question concerns the very deep radio searches done of 34 pulsars discovered in blind pulsation searches of gamma rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : only four of them were found to also be radio emitters ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the remaining one , psr  j2032 + 4127 @xcite , is like  in that they are both located in the cygnus region and both are relatively bright , being detectable in 1  minute with the gbt at 2ghz .",
    "they were not known prior to the launch of  simply because no sensitive surveys had ( or have yet fully ) been done of the northern ( equatorial ) reaches of the galactic plane , using the high radio frequencies desired to unveil the galactic disk .",
    "conversely , the enormously successful 1.4ghz parkes multibeam survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) _ did _ search the entire galactic plane at @xmath140 with sensitivity sufficient to detect ordinary ( non - msp ) radio pulsars with @xmath141mjykpc@xmath139 out to @xmath142kpc .",
    "a very large fraction of all potentially detectable ordinary radio pulsars in that area of the sky that could also be plausible gamma - ray sources were therefore discovered before  launch , especially when adding those discovered in deep pointed observations of known pulsar wind nebulae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in time",
    ", several of these pulsars were detected by lat ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "subsequent to the parkes multibeam survey an even deeper parkes survey extended galactic plane coverage out to @xmath143 ( camilo et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , and the on - going palfa arecibo survey is doing so out to @xmath144 @xcite .    in our view , the above suggests that the answer to `` why have more radio pulsars not been detected among the unidentified galactic plane lat sources ? ''",
    "is that the vast majority of ordinary radio pulsars accessible to the current generation of telescopes and located within a few degrees of the plane at @xmath145 that can yield an appreciable gamma - ray flux at the earth were discovered a long time ago ( it is possible that in rare but important cases very high @xmath146 distant pulsars will have their radio pulses scattered beyond practical detectability ) .    many of the lat sources that remain unidentified along the galactic plane are surely pulsars  but they may not be detectable as radio sources , and should be searched anew in gamma rays ( some of these may be in binaries , and inaccessible to current blind searches ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "is bright enough that it would have been discovered in blind searches of 18 months of lat data , if the photon selection criteria had been adjusted to take into account its flat spectrum ( e.g. , if only photons with @xmath147gev had been searched for pulsations ) , as we confirmed after discovery .",
    "spectral analysis of a region can improve the signal - to - noise ratio by selecting events based on the probability that they come from the source of interest ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and applying this technique to the cygnus region also resulted in the unbiased detection of pulsations from .",
    "for fainter point sources superimposed on the large and uncertain diffuse galactic background , spectral analysis and localization are harder (  was only @xmath148 from the actual pulsar position ) , but these and other improvements in search techniques are already resulting in the discovery of many more gamma - ray pulsars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence , the ratio of known gamma - ray - only to gamma - ray - and - radio ordinary pulsars , which is currently slightly under 1.0 , should increase substantially .",
    "when will we ever learn all that we can ( in the  era ) about the geometry and emission properties of gamma - ray and radio pulsar accelerators ?",
    "perhaps when full details emerge from the continuing collaborative radio and gamma - ray observational and modeling work .",
    "the future is bright ( at some wavelength ) , but requires publication of all searches , including radio non - detections , and consideration of the non - detection by lat of radio pulsars with very large @xmath4 flux at the earth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
