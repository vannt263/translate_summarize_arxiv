    "one of the fundamental questions of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb)@xcite . the simplest description of ewsb results in one neutral scalar particle , the higgs boson , which has well known problems associated with it . a priori",
    ", a more complicated higgs sector is phenomenologically just as viable .",
    "the next simplest case is the general two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "a constrained version of the 2hdm arises in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite where spontaneous symmetry breaking is induced by two complex higgs doublets and leads to five physical scalars ; the neutral cp - even @xmath5 and @xmath3 bosons , the neutral cp - odd @xmath4 boson , and the charged @xmath6 bosons . at tree level",
    "the mssm higgs sector has two free parameters which are usually taken to be the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , @xmath7 , and the mass of the @xmath4 boson , @xmath8 .",
    "the elucidation of ewsb is the primary goal of the large hadron collider at cern ( lhc ) .",
    "direct searches at lep2 yield lower limits @xmath9  gev for the sm higgs mass @xcite and @xmath10  gev for the neutral susy higgs masses while @xmath11  gev depending on the @xmath6 decay modes .",
    "more detailed results have been presented by the lep collaborations as plots of excluded regions of the mssm parameter space @xcite .",
    "similar plots have been obtained by the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron @xmath12 collider @xcite .",
    "it is expected that run ii of the tevatron @xmath12 collider will be able to find evidence at @xmath13 for the sm higgs boson up to about 180  gev although a @xmath14 signal is limited to around 130  gev @xcite .    in proton - proton collisions at @xmath15  tev at the lhc",
    "the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite experiments have shown that they are sensitive to the sm higgs boson over the entire mass range of 100 - 1000  gev .",
    "the mssm higgs boson can be discovered in a variety of channels so that at least one higgs boson can be discovered for the entire parameter range . in a fraction of the parameter space",
    "more than one higgs boson is accessible .",
    "however , there is a region in which the extended nature of the supersymmetric higgs sector may not be observable since only the lightest higgs boson can be seen in sm - like production processes .",
    "likewise , only a limited number of measurements of higgs boson properties can be carried out at the lhc .",
    "a future high energy linear @xmath1 collider has been proposed as an instrument that can perform precision measurements that would complement those performed at the lhc @xcite . in this context , the photon - photon `` compton - collider '' option , from backscattered laser light off of highly energetic and possibly polarized electron beams , has been advocated as a valuable part of the lc physics program @xcite . recently ,",
    "a number of papers have shown how the compton - collider option can make important measurements in the higgs sector @xcite .",
    "for example , the analysis by mhlleitner , _ et al .",
    "_ , shows that the @xmath16 option of tesla can be used to produce the @xmath5 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 for intermediate values of @xmath17 that may escape discovery at the lhc @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that the hadronic content of the photon can result in cross sections large enough that they should be considered in precision measurements of @xmath18 cross sections and that they may be useful in the study of the higgs sector of the theory .",
    "the importance of resolved photon contributions has been demonstrated by the opal @xcite and delphi @xcite collaborations in obtaining interesting limits on leptoquark properties from @xmath19 production of leptoquarks @xcite .",
    "the resolved photon approach is the same for all processes we consider so we begin with a brief description of the generic approach shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the resolved photon approach the quark and gluon content of the photon",
    "are treated as partons described by partonic distributions , @xmath20 in direct analogy to partons inside hadrons @xcite .",
    "the parton subprocess cross sections are convoluted with the parton distributions to obtain the final cross sections . however , since the photons themselves have an associated spectrum , either the energy distribution obtained from backscattering a laser from an electron beam @xcite or the weizscker williams distribution @xcite , we must further convolute the cross sections with the photon distributions to obtain cross sections that can be compared to experiment . thus",
    ", the cross sections are found by evaluating the following expression : @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents parton @xmath23 in the photon which could be a quark , anti - quark , or gluon , @xmath24 represents the subprocess cross section with parton c of m energy @xmath25 .",
    "the processes we are studying are typically of the form @xmath26 and therefore take a particularly simple form . in this preliminary study",
    "we only include tree - level contributions and are aware that higher order corrections are likely to be non - negligible .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that our approach is satisfactory for a first survey of resolved photon contributions to identify which processes may warrant more detailed study .",
    "we will adopt the standard used in many lc studies that 20 events represents an interesting signal for the canonical integrated luminosities used in such studies of 1  ab@xmath27 .",
    "we do not include branching ratios , detector efficiencies , nor consider backgrounds . in the former case",
    "the branching ratios are well known @xcite and we assume that the environment is sufficiently clean that the signal can be reconstructed with reasonable efficiency . clearly , our study is crude and a more detailed study is warranted which includes a realistic consideration of detector acceptance and efficiency assumptions , decays leading to final state particles , and background studies .",
    "our calculations have explicit dependence on the @xmath28 and @xmath29-quark masses .",
    "we take @xmath30  gev , @xmath31  gev , @xmath32  gev , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 @xcite . in addition",
    ", we used @xmath35  gev , @xmath36  gev@xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39  gev .",
    "we begin with sm higgs production because the discovery and elucidation of the standard model higgs boson is the first order of business for any future collider project .",
    "one of the strongest motivations for the compton collider is to measure higgs boson properties .",
    "the @xmath40 production of the higgs boson is an especially interesting reaction @xcite as it proceeds via loop contributions @xcite and is therefore sensitive to new particles much higher in mass than the cofm energy that can not be produced directly .",
    "it has also been suggested that this reaction can be used to distinguish between the sm higgs and the lightest scalar higgs of the mssm in the decoupling limit in which no other higgs or susy particles are observed at the lc @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important that all sm contributions to this cross section be carefully considered .",
    "the first process we consider is @xmath41 where the quark and anti - quark arise from the quark parton distributions of the photon , the so called resolved photon processes .",
    "the expression for the subprocess cross section is rather trivial and is given by : @xmath42 the cross section is dominated by the @xmath28-quark content .",
    "the lower mass of the @xmath28-quark enters eqn .",
    "[ qqtoh ] quadratically , but its charge and mass enhance the @xmath28-quark content in the photon . in fig .",
    "2 we show , for the backscattered laser case with @xmath43  gev , 1  tev and 1.5  tev using the grv distribution functions @xcite , the contributions from both @xmath44 and @xmath45 production and the sum of the two .",
    "we also show the cross sections for the subprocess @xmath46 @xcite which we calculated using the comphep computer package @xcite .",
    "the contributions from lighter quarks ( including the @xmath29 ) are dominated by the collinear region of @xmath47 , and as such are well described via the resolved photon approach . on the other hand , due to its large mass",
    ", the @xmath48-quark avoids the collinear region so that the resolved photon approach is inappropriate and we use the full subprocess .",
    "for the higgs masses we consider , this process is below threshold for @xmath49  gev due to the t - quarks produced .",
    "for @xmath50  gev , where there is more available phase space , this mechanism is interesting for higgs masses up to about 200  gev and up to about 300  gev for @xmath51  gev .",
    "whether these two cases are interesting experimentally will depend crucially on the t - quark tagging efficiency .    for comparison",
    "we also show the @xmath52 production which proceeds via loops .",
    "the expressions are well known in the literature @xcite and we do not reproduce them here . likewise , we show the contribution from gluon fusion , @xmath53 , which arises from the gluon content of the photon . again ,",
    "the subprocess cross section is well known in the literature . a final process that will produce higgs bosons is @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the cross section was calculated using comphep @xcite and is shown as the dot - dashed curves in fig .",
    "the cross sections are seen to be substantial , rivalling the dominant @xmath18 at @xmath51  gev although it is much smaller at @xmath49  gev , where it is comparable to the resolved photon processes we are interested in . to some extent",
    "this process can be disentangled from the @xmath55 process and the resolved photon processes via @xmath56 and jet tagging .",
    "nevertheless it is yet another ingredient that should be considered in measuring the higgs two - photon width .",
    "the two photon process dominates the resolved photon processes over the full range of higgs masses we consider .",
    "the gluon - fusion process is almost three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath57 over the entire @xmath58 range .",
    "we note that for @xmath59  gev the gluon - fusion contribution increases to about 10% of the total @xmath60 contributions for @xmath61  gev .",
    "this reflects the increasing importance of the small @xmath62 contributions from the gluon distributions at higher @xmath63 .",
    "nevertheless , it does not seem unreasonable to neglect the gluon fusion contributions in our results .",
    "in contrast , the quark annihilation processes contribute at the percent level for @xmath64  gev and @xmath43  gev .",
    "this increases to the several percent level for @xmath65  tev .",
    "this higgs mass region has received considerable attention for study at a future linear collider and compton collider and measurements of the @xmath55 cross section at this level of precision is touted as a probe of new physics entering via loops .",
    "recent studies by asner _",
    "et al _ @xcite and by krawczyk _",
    "et al _ @xcite find that these processes can be measured to approximately the 2% level .",
    "thus , depending on @xmath58 , higgs production via the hadronic content of the photon may not be negligible at this level of precision , suggesting that these contributions deserve further study .",
    "there exist many different sets of photon parton distributions in the literature @xcite . in fig .",
    "3 we give an indication of the uncertainties due to the distribution functions by plotting the variation in cross section using different photon parton distribution functions . the solid band and shaded bands are for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath53 using the do @xcite , grv @xcite , dg @xcite , lac1 and lac2@xcite distributions .",
    "this , by no means represents a complete survey of available distributions and is only meant to illustrate the uncertainties inherent in our current knowledge .",
    "it can be seen that there is considerable variation in the cross section depending on the specific distribution used . fortunately , with significant amounts of new data from the lep and hera experiments , revised distributions based on these new data are arriving @xcite . to take a conservative approach we used the grv distributions which generally give the smallest cross sections .",
    "in addition to the compton collider configuration , @xmath0 luminosities arise at @xmath68 and @xmath1 colliders . in @xmath68 collisions",
    "one @xmath69 comes from a backscattered laser as before , while the second photon is a weizscker - williams bremsstrahlung photon . in @xmath1",
    "both photons are weizscker - williams photons .",
    "the weizscker - williams photon spectrum is softer than the backscattered laser spectrum but it extends to higher @xmath70 . in fig .",
    "4 we show the sm higgs production cross section as a function of @xmath58 for the 3 cases . as we go from @xmath0 to @xmath68 to @xmath1 the cross section decreases by about an order of magnitude in each case although at larger values of @xmath58 , near the kinematic limit where the @xmath0 luminosity goes to zero , the @xmath0 luminosity extends further out for the @xmath68 and @xmath1 cases .",
    "we find similar patterns for charged higgs production and the production of the heavier higgs bosons of the mssm model .",
    "we will therefore only show cross sections for the @xmath0 case , although for completeness we mention results for the @xmath1 and @xmath68 cases when appropriate .      charged higgs bosons arise naturally from the simplest extension of the sm : the introduction of a second higgs doublet .",
    "two variations of the two doublet model are discussed in the literature : in model i , @xmath71 couples to both the @xmath72 and @xmath73-type quarks and the other field decouples . in model ii , which arises in the mssm , @xmath71 couples to the up - type quarks and @xmath74 to the down - type quarks .",
    "the ratio of these vev s is one of the fundamental parameters of the theory ; @xmath75 . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to model ii .",
    "a charged higgs boson will be difficult to find at the lhc if its mass is greater than @xmath76  gev .",
    "this discovery reach is extended to almost @xmath77 at an @xmath1 linear collider where they can be pair produced in the process @xmath78 with a cross section which depends mainly on the @xmath6 mass , dropping quickly near threshold due to @xmath79-wave suppression @xcite .",
    "charged higgs bosons can also be pair produced in the process @xmath80 @xcite given the interest in their properties , there have been a number of recent studies of single charged higgs bosons at lc s @xcite .",
    "if charged higgs bosons were observed , cross section measurements could potentially give information about the underlying theory .",
    "as before the subprocess cross section is rather straightforward to calculate and for @xmath81 fusion in model ii is given by : @xmath82 with an analogous expression for @xmath83 fusion .",
    "we include in our results a factor of 2 to take into account that the @xmath29-quark can come from either photon and likewise for the @xmath28 anti - quark and a 2nd factor of 2 for summing over @xmath84 and @xmath85 production .",
    "a priori one would expect the @xmath86 process to dominate over the @xmath87 process due to the much larger mass of the @xmath29-quark compared to the @xmath88-quark mass .",
    "however , the mass ratios @xmath89 and @xmath90 are compensated by the ratio of the ckm matrix elements @xmath91 so that @xmath92 and @xmath93 . for small values of @xmath17",
    "the @xmath87 fusion process will be larger than the @xmath94 fusion process .",
    "in addition to @xmath86 and @xmath87 fusion , charged higgs bosons can also be produced via @xmath95 fusion .",
    "the @xmath48-quark is too heavy to be treated as a massless constituent of the photon so in this case we calculate the cross section for @xmath96 .",
    "although this last process will have a kinematic limit constrained by the higgs and @xmath48-quark mass , below threshold it is the dominant contribution due to the large @xmath48-quark mass @xcite . above the @xmath97 threshold",
    "the relative importance of the @xmath87 and @xmath94 subprocesses is dependent on @xmath17 via eqn [ bctoch ] .",
    "the various contributions are shown in fig . 5 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath49  gev .",
    "it should be noted that the cross sections for @xmath100 are larger than those for @xmath98 . in all cases , for relatively low @xmath58",
    ", the largest contribution to the total charged higgs production cross section comes from the @xmath101 contribution .",
    "as the higgs mass increases the other contributions become dominant until the @xmath101 contribution goes to zero at the @xmath48-@xmath102 kinematic limit . for small values of @xmath17",
    "the @xmath87 contribution is larger than the @xmath86 contribution while for large values of @xmath17 the @xmath87 and @xmath94 contributions are comparable in size . in fig .",
    "6 we show the sum of these three contributions for a range of values of @xmath17 . for comparison , we also show the cross sections for @xmath103 ( medium dashed line ) @xcite and for @xmath104 ( dot - dashed line ) @xcite .    using the criteria adopted by the tesla tdr of 20 events for 1  ab@xmath27 of integrated luminosity we find that for @xmath49  gev , a charged higgs bosons can be detected in this process up to @xmath105  gev and 240  gev for @xmath10640 , and 30 respectively . as we have not taken into account acceptance cuts nor have we examined background reduction these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "a proper analysis would require detailed simulations including detector dependent considerations which are clearly beyond the scope of the present work . with this caveat , for the high @xmath17 cases , a charged higgs boson could be detected with mass roughly comparable to the standard kinematic limit associated with charged particle pair production at @xmath1 colliders .",
    "however , these cross sections are greater than most of the processes considered by kanemura , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite so that cross section information from this production mechanism would offer complementary information to other processes . for @xmath107 , charged higgs boson production in model i would be too small to be observed .",
    "we also considered the case where the photons bremsstrahlunged off of the incident @xmath108 beams using the weizscker - williams effective photon distribution . in this case",
    "the cross sections would only produce measurable event rates for higgs masses much smaller than could be produced in the pair production process @xmath109 .",
    "the intermediate case , for an @xmath68 collider , where one photon radiates off an initial beam electron and the other obtained from backscattering a laser off of the initial electron beam results in a cross section intermediate in magnitude between the @xmath0 case and @xmath1 case . using the same criteria as above , for @xmath49",
    "gev we obtain measurable rates for @xmath110 and 165  gev for the @xmath10630 and 40 cases .",
    "the discovery limits for various collider energies are summarized in table i. given that @xmath111 is significantly larger than these cross sections it is unlikely that much would be learned from this process in @xmath68 collisions .    motivated by the article of kanemura , _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we also calculated the resolved photon contributions to @xmath112 production which proceeds via @xmath60 fusion through an intermediate neutral higgs boson .",
    "however , the cross sections were found to be small with event rates uninteresting from an experimental point of view .      in two higgs doublet models there",
    "exist a total of three neutral higgs bosons in addition to the two charged higgs bosons discussed above .",
    "the three neutral higgs bosons consist of two cp - even bosons , @xmath113 and @xmath102 , the former light and the latter heavy , and a heavy cp - odd boson @xmath114 . at the cern lhc ,",
    "the pseudoscalar higgs is not detectable above @xmath115  gev for intermediate values of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the mssm higgs bosons can be produced in @xmath0 collisions , @xmath116 , with favorable cross sections allowing a heavy higgs boson to be found up to 70 - 80% of the initial @xmath1 collider energy for moderate values of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that the resolved photon process has different dependence on @xmath17 than the process proceeding through intermediate loops @xcite .",
    "for example , the two - photon decay width of the @xmath4 is small for large @xmath17 while the decay width of the @xmath3 is small for small @xmath17 @xcite . for the resolved photon processes , for large @xmath117 the @xmath4 and @xmath3 have roughly similar cross sections independent of @xmath17 .",
    "we use the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , to partially constrain the parameters of the model in our calculations @xcite . taking @xmath17 and @xmath117 or @xmath118 as input",
    ", the rest of the parameters can be calculated . for simplicity , and given the other uncertainties in our results , we use tree level relationships for the various parameters .",
    "these are given by : @xmath119 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\cos 2\\alpha = -\\cos 2\\beta \\left ( { { m_a^2 -m_z^2}\\over { m_h^2   -m_h^2 } } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the higgs couplings to quarks are given by : @xmath120    these couplings result in the following subprocess cross sections : @xmath121    the cross sections for @xmath3 and @xmath4 production via @xmath45 and @xmath44 annihilation for @xmath122 and 30 are shown in fig 7 . for higher values of @xmath17 , @xmath45 annihilation dominates , while for lower values , @xmath44 annihilation becomes more and more important until at sufficiently small values of @xmath17 the @xmath44 annihilation contribution will become larger than the @xmath45 contribution .",
    "8 shows the sum of the @xmath123 and @xmath124 contributions for a variety of @xmath17 values for @xmath125 and 1000  gev . for a @xmath0 collider with @xmath43  gev , again using the criteria of 20 events for integrated luminosity of 1  ab@xmath27 , the @xmath3 can be observed up to 375  gev , 365  gev , 275  gev , 175  gev and 135  gev for @xmath106 40 , 30 , 7 , 3 , and 1.5 respectively .",
    "the cross section is totally dominated by @xmath45 annihilation for the three large @xmath17 cases while for @xmath100 the @xmath44 contribution is actually larger for the values of @xmath58 with large enough cross section to allow for discovery .",
    "the relative importance crosses over for @xmath126  gev but for the full range of @xmath58 shown , the @xmath44 contribution is not negligible .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath4 production are very similar to the @xmath3 cross sections so we do not show them but simply summarize the results in table ii .    for both @xmath102 and @xmath114 production , for the larger values of @xmath17 , the @xmath3 and @xmath4 will be produced in substantial numbers for masses substantially larger than @xmath127 . even if one uses a much more stringent criteria for discovery than the one we have adopted here",
    ", we expect that the heavy higgs bosons can be observed with relatively high masses .",
    "this is in contrast to the sm higgs production where the resolved photon contributions are at best a non - negligible contribution that need to be understood in precision measurements .",
    "if @xmath102 and @xmath114 were produced in sufficient quantity it is possible that the cross section could be used to constrain @xmath17 in analogy to the proposal by barger , _ et al . _ to use heavy higgs productions to determine @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "thus , the resolved photon contributions may very well play an important role in understanding the higgs sector .",
    "this can be seen most clearly by showing the regions of the @xmath128 plot which can be explored via @xmath102 and @xmath114 production .",
    "plots are given in fig .",
    "9 for @xmath49 and 1000  gev .",
    "three regions are shown .",
    "region 1 is for @xmath129  fb which would result in @xmath130 events for 1  ab@xmath27 , region 2 is for @xmath131  fb which would result in @xmath132 events while in region 3 less than 20 events would be expected .",
    "the regions covered would complement measurements made in other processes .",
    "the resolved photon contributions to two photon production of the sm higgs boson is non - negligible for the more probable higgs masses found in electroweak fits . given that this process it touted as a sensitive probe of new physics via loop contributions it is important that the resolved photon contributions be understood at the same level as the loop contributions .",
    "the resolved photon production of charged higgs is unlikely to be an important production mechanism .",
    "at best , if @xmath118 and @xmath17 take on certain values , it may offer complementary information to other processes .",
    "resolved photon production of the heavy higgs bosons in the mssm are potentially the most interesting processes .",
    "they can be produced up to relatively high mass and in regions of mssm parameter space that complements other measurements .",

    "<S> we study single higgs boson production in @xmath0 collisions proceeding via the hadronic content of the photon . </S>",
    "<S> these processes complement previous studies of pair and single higgs production at @xmath1 colliders . for sm higgs masses of current theoretical interest , </S>",
    "<S> the resolved photon contributions are non - negligible in precision cross section measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the charged higgs cross sections are not competitive with the @xmath2 process and at best might offer some information about quark - higgs couplings . finally , resolved photon production of the heavier higgs bosons , @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the mssm , can probe regions of the susy parameter space that will complement other measurements . this last process shows some promise in susy higgs searches and warrants further study .    1.0 cm </S>"
