    "classical level raising results typically show that if the reduction mod @xmath0 of a level @xmath4 modular form @xmath5 has certain properties ( depending on a prime @xmath6 ) , then there exists a modular form @xmath7 of level @xmath8 , new at @xmath3 , with @xmath9 .",
    "an example of a level raising result for classical modular forms is the following , due to ribet @xcite :    let @xmath10 be an eigenform , and let @xmath11 be a finite place of @xmath12 such that @xmath13 and @xmath5 is not congruent to an eisenstein series modulo @xmath14 . if @xmath15 is a prime number such that the following condition is satisfied , @xmath16 then there exists a @xmath3-new eigenform @xmath17 congruent to @xmath5 modulo @xmath14 .",
    "in this paper we prove an analogous level raising result for families of @xmath0-adic automorphic forms . in @xcite and",
    "part iii of @xcite , buzzard defines modules of overconvergent @xmath0-adic automorphic forms for definite quaternion algebras , and constructs from these a so - called ` eigencurve ' .",
    "the eigencurve is a rigid analytic variety whose points correspond to certain systems of eigenvalues for hecke algebras acting on these modules of automorphic forms .",
    "this space @xmath0-adically interpolates the systems of eigenvalues arising from classical automorphic forms .",
    "emerton has constructed eigenvarieties in a cohomological framework @xcite , but in the following we will work with buzzard s more concrete construction .",
    "since we first wrote the present text , we have also proven some cases of level raising for @xmath0-adic modular forms using the completed cohomology spaces investigated by emerton ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the first construction of an eigencurve was carried out for modular forms ( automorphic forms for @xmath18 ) in coleman and mazur s seminal paper @xcite .",
    "an important recent result is the construction of a @xmath0-adic jacquet - langlands map between an eigencurve for a definite quaternion algebra and the @xmath18 eigencurve ( interpolating the usual jacquet - langlands correspondence ) , as carried out in @xcite .",
    "we follow the general approach of the first part of diamond and taylor s paper @xcite , and our theorem [ supporttheorem ] is an analogue of theorem 1 in that paper , but several new features appear in our work . in particular , the level raising results in @xcite and @xcite for definite quaternion algebras are proved by utilising a pairing on finite dimensional vector spaces of automorphic forms . in our setting , the spaces of automorphic forms are banach modules over an affinoid algebra , so we introduce spaces of ` dual ' automorphic forms and work with the pairing between the usual space of automorphic forms and the dual space .",
    "we then prove suitable forms of ihara s lemma , our theorem [ lemma : trivialtorsion ] ( cf .",
    "lemma 2 of @xcite ) , for the usual and dual spaces of automorphic forms .",
    "an interesting asymmetry between the two situations can be observed .",
    "this investigation of level raising results was motivated by a conjecture made by a. paulin , prompted by results on local - global compatibility on the eigencurve in his thesis @xcite .",
    "paulin s conjecture was made for the @xmath18-eigencurve ; we may apply our theorem to the image of the @xmath0-adic jacquet - langlands map there to prove many cases of his conjecture .",
    "since we have applications to the eigencurve for @xmath19 in mind we work with definite quaternion algebras over @xmath2 in this paper , but some of the methods of section [ mainbody ] should apply to definite quaternion algebras over any totally real number field , although we do use the fact that weight space is one - dimensional in our arguments .",
    "we end this introduction by stating the conjecture made by paulin .",
    "we fix two distinct primes @xmath0 and @xmath3 , and an integer @xmath4 coprime to @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the cuspidal eigencurve of tame level @xmath22 , parametrising overconvergent cuspidal @xmath0-adic modular eigenforms ( see @xcite for its construction ) .",
    "if @xmath23 is a point of @xmath21 , corresponding to an eigenform @xmath24 , paulin defines an associated representation of @xmath25 , denoted @xmath26 .",
    "we call an irreducible connected component @xmath27 of the eigencurve _ generically special _ if the @xmath25-representations associated to the points of @xmath27 away from a discrete set are special .",
    "we define _ generically unramified principal series _ similarly .",
    "denote by @xmath28 and @xmath29 the roots of the polynomial @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the @xmath33 and @xmath34 eigenvalues of @xmath24 .",
    "paulin makes the conjecture :    suppose @xmath27 is generically unramified principal series .",
    "suppose further that there is a point @xmath23 on @xmath27 where the ratio of @xmath28 and @xmath29 becomes @xmath35 and @xmath26 is special .",
    "then there exists a generically special component @xmath36 intersecting @xmath27 at @xmath23 .",
    "chenevier raised the same question ( in a slightly different form ) in relation to the characterisation of the zariski closure of the @xmath3-new classical forms in the eigencurve .",
    "we address this issue in section [ neweigen ] .",
    "finally , in a recent preprint @xcite paulin has proved versions of his level raising ( and lowering ) conjectures ( even for ramified principal series ) .",
    "his techniques are completely different to ours , making use of deformation theory and requiring a recent important result of emerton showing that the space @xmath37 constructed by kisin in @xcite is equal to the @xmath18-eigencurve ( if one restricts to pieces of the two spaces where certain conditions are satisfied by the relevant mod @xmath0 galois representations ) .",
