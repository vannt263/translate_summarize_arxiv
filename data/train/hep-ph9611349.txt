    "recently it has been found that cumulant moments of the multiplicity distributions both in @xmath0 annihilations and hadronic collisions show prominent oscillatory behaviors when plotted as a function of their order @xmath2 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "this behavior was attributed to the qcd - type of branching processes apparently taking place in those reactions . however , in @xcite we have shown that the same behavior of the moments emerges essentially from the modified negative binomial distribution ( mnbd ) ( which actually describes the data much better than the negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) @xcite ) .",
