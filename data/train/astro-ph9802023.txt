    "soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgr ) are a rare class of recurrent high energy transient believed to be associated with young neutron stars @xcite .",
    "sgr1806 - 20 is the most prolific object in this class . between 1978 and 1986",
    "more than one hundred burst events were detected from this source by x - ray detectors on the international cometary explorer ( ice ) satellite @xcite .",
    "various bursts from this source have also been detected by many of the interplanetary network instruments @xcite .",
    "batse detected a reactivation of sgr1806 - 20 in november , 1996 @xcite .",
    "this triggered pointed observations of this source with rxte in an effort to investigate burst spectra , search for pulsations , extend the burst size distribution to much fainter levels and investigate the spectrum of the persistent emission .",
    "we obtained a set of 4 pointed observations totaling 100 ksec of on source time .",
    "observations from nov .",
    "18 , 03:25:00 utc to 11:30:00 utc revealed more than 100 sgr bursts ranging in peak flux from @xmath4 ergs @xmath1 s@xmath5 to @xmath6 @xmath7 ergs @xmath1 s@xmath5 .",
    "here we summarize some of the x - ray spectral properties of these bursts as measured with the proportional counter array ( pca ) .",
    "a striking feature of sgr bursts noted from previous studies is the uniformity of spectra from burst to burst and within a single event @xcite . with its large area",
    ", low background and high time resolution pca observations can test the uniformity of sgr burst spectra to a much greater level than previous instruments .",
    "we have not yet completed an exhaustive investigation of burst spectra , however , we have investigated a sample of moderately bright bursts for which the pca deadtime is not excessive .",
    "we give examples of spectral variability from burst to burst as well as evidence for significant spectral evolution in a single event .",
    "we obtained x - ray event data with 125 @xmath8s ( 1/8192 sec ) time resolution and 64 spectral channels across the 2 - 100 kev pca bandpass .",
    "for each burst we estimated the background using about 20 s of pre- and post - burst data . in all cases",
    "the backgrounds were flat .",
    "for the bursts described here the background was at most a few percent of the total counts .",
    "figure 1 shows the time history of one of the bursts detected in the pca .",
    "we fit spectra with optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung ( ottb ) and power law models both modified by photelectric absorption .",
    "both models provide statistically acceptable fits to most bursts , but the ottb model provides a marginally better fit in almost all cases .",
    "we also fit the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) model which has now been used extensively to investigate the continuum spectra of grb with batse @xcite , but the ottb model also provides a marginally better fit than this model .",
    "figure 2 shows the best fit ottb model for the burst in figure 1 . the best fit temperature , @xmath9 , and column density of hydrogen , @xmath10 , for this burst are 164 kev and @xmath11 @xmath1 .",
    "we tested for spectral variability from burst to burst by comparing the derived confidence regions for the ottb model parameters for different bursts . as we show below , different bursts",
    "do show statistically significant differences in the derived ottb model parameters . to illustrate this we compare in figure 3 the derived confidence regions for two bursts which had similar peak countrates and durations .",
    "we compare bursts with similar peak countrates in order to reduce any spectral changes that could be introduced by differential deadtime effects . even at peak rates of 50,000 cts",
    "/ sec the deadtime fraction is not more than about 18 % , and is reasonably well understood @xcite .",
    "we show the 68 , 90 , and 99 % confidence contours for each burst .",
    "the contours were computed by calculating the @xmath12 appropriate for three parameters ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and normalization constant ) @xcite .",
    "the contours centered at @xmath13 kev and @xmath14 @xmath1 are those for the burst shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the confidence regions for these two bursts are disjoint at the 99.9 % level , suggesting that these two bursts had measurably different spectra .",
    "this result is not unique to these two bursts , across the sample of bursts analysed to date we find that values for @xmath9 and @xmath10 can range from @xmath15 kev to @xmath16 @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we have also investigated spectral variations within bursts .",
    "figure 4 shows the time history of a bright burst which shows evidence for spectral evolution .",
    "we accumulated spectra both at the rising and falling edges of this burst .",
    "the accumulation intervals are denoted by the vertical dashed lines in figure 4 .",
    "we selected the intervals to have approximately the same total number of counts as well as similar countrate profiles to again minimize any differential deadtime effects .",
    "figure 5 compares the confidence regions for the ottb model parameters for both the rising and falling portions of the burst .",
    "the rising interval is represented by the contours with the higher ( harder ) temperature .",
    "the regions are disjoint at the @xmath17 level , suggesting that the spectrum during the rising portion of this burst was moderately harder than during the falling portion . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first substantial evidence for spectral variations during bursts from sgr1806 - 20 .",
    "spectral results based on ice data from sgr1806 - 20 showed strong evidence for a rolloff in the burst spectra below about 8 - 10 kev @xcite .",
    "our results confirm the presence of a downturn in the photon spectrum at about 4 - 5 kev .",
    "all models we investigated required with high significance such a rolloff in the photon number spectrum .",
    "our modelling with a photelectric absorption component implies an absorbing column of @xmath18 @xmath1 . this is higher than the @xmath19 @xmath1 inferred from asca measurements @xcite , but significantly less than the column of about @xmath20 @xmath1 suggested from the analysis of ice data @xcite",
