    "randomized load balancing , where a job is assigned to a server from a small subset of randomly chosen servers , is very simple to implement , and can surprisingly deliver better performance ( for example reducing collisions , waiting times , backlogs ) in a number of applications , such as data centers , hash tables , distributed memory machines , path selection in networks , and task assignment at web servers .",
    "one useful model extensively used to study randomized load balancing schemes is the supermarket model . in the supermarket model",
    ", a key result by vvedenskaya , dobrushin and karpelevich @xcite indicated that when each poisson arriving job is assigned to the shortest one of @xmath0 randomly chosen queues with exponential service times , the equilibrium queue length can decay doubly exponentially in the limit as the population size @xmath1 , and the stationary fraction of queues with at least @xmath2 customers is @xmath3 , which indicates a substantially exponential improvement over the case for @xmath4 , where the tail of stationary queue length in the corresponding m / m/1 queue is @xmath5 . at the same time , the exponential improvement is also illustrated by another key work in which luczak and mcdiarmid @xcite studied the maximum queue length in the supermarket model with poisson arrivals and exponential service times .",
    "the distributed load balancing strategies in which individual job decisions are based on information on a limited number of other processors , have been studied by analytical methods in eager , lazokwska and zahorjan @xcite and by trace - driven simulations in zhou @xcite .",
    "based on this , the supermarket models can be developed by using either queueing theory or markov processes .",
    "most of recent research deals with a simple supermarket model with poisson arrivals and exponential service times by means of density dependent jump markov processes .",
    "the methods used in the recent literature are based on determining the behavior of the supermarket model as its population size grows to infinity , and its behavior is naturally described as a system of differential equations whose fixed point leads to a closed - form solution with a doubly exponential structure .",
    "readers may refer to , such as , azar , broder , karlin and upfal @xcite , vvedenskaya , dobrushin and karpelevich @xcite and mitzenmacher @xcite .",
    "certain generalizations of the supermarket models have been explored , for example , in studying simple variations by mitzenmacher and vcking @xcite , mitzenmacher @xcite , vcking @xcite , mitzenmacher , richa , and sitaraman @xcite and vvedenskaya and suhov @xcite ; in discussing load information by mirchandaney , towsley , and stankovic @xcite , dahlin @xcite and mitzenmacher @xcite ; and in mathematical analysis by graham @xcite , luczak and norris @xcite and luczak and mcdiarmid @xcite .",
    "using fast jackson networks , martin and suhov @xcite , martin @xcite , suhov and vvedenskaya @xcite studied supermarket mall models , where each node in a jackson network is replaced by @xmath6 parallel servers , and a job joins the shortest of @xmath7 randomly chosen queues at the node to which it is directed . for non - poisson arrivals or for non - exponential service times , li , lui and wang @xcite discussed the supermarket model with poisson arrivals and ph service times , and indicated that the fixed point decreases doubly exponentially , where the stationary phase - type environment is shown to be a crucial factor .",
    "bramson , lu and prabhakar @xcite provided a modularized program based on ansatz for treating the supermarket model with poisson arrivals and general service times , and li @xcite further discussed this supermarket model by means of a system of integral - differential equations , and illustrated that the fixed point decreases doubly exponentially and that the heavy - tailed service times do not change the doubly exponential solution to the fixed point .    for the ph distribution , readers may refer to neuts @xcite and li @xcite .",
    "the map is a useful mathematical model , for example , for describing bursty traffic , self similarity and long - range dependence in modern computer networks , e.g. , see adler , feldman and taqqu @xcite . for detail information of the map , readers may refer to chapter 5 in neuts @xcite , lucantoni @xcite , chapter 1 in li @xcite , and three excellent overviews by neuts @xcite , chakravarthy @xcite and cordeiro and kharoufeh @xcite .",
    "in computer networks , andersen and nielsen @xcite applied the map to describe long - range dependence , and yoshihara , kasahara and takahashi @xcite analyzed self - similar traffic by means of a markov - modulated poisson process .",
    "it is interesting to answer whether or how non - poisson arrivals or non - exponential service times can disrupt doubly exponential solutions to the fixed points in supermarket models . to that end , this paper studies a supermarket model with maps and ph service times , and shows that there still exists a doubly exponential solution to the fixed point .",
    "the main contributions of the paper are threefold .",
    "the first one is to provide a novel matrix - analytic approach to study the supermarket model with maps and ph service times .",
    "based on density dependent jump markov processes , the supermarket model is described as a system of differential vector equations whose fixed point has a closed - form solution with a doubly exponential structure .",
    "the second one is to obtain a crucial result that the fixed point can be decomposed into the product of two factors inflecting arrival information and service information , which indicates that the doubly exponential solution to the fixed point can exist extensively , but it is not always unique for more general supermarket models .",
    "the third one is to analyze exponential convergence of the current location of the supermarket model to its fixed point .",
    "not only does the exponential convergence indicate the existence of the fixed point , but it also shows that such a convergent process is very fast . to study the limit behavior of the supermarket model as its population size goes to infinity , this paper applies the kurtz theorem to study density dependent jump markov process given in the supermarket model with maps and ph service times , which leads to the lipschitz condition under which the fraction measure of the supermarket model weakly converges the system of differential vector equations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we first describe a supermarket model with maps and ph service times . then the supermarket model is described as a systems of differential vector equations in terms of density dependent jump markov processes . in section 3 ,",
    "we first introduce a fixed point of the system of differential vector equations , and set up a system of nonlinear equations satisfied by the fixed point .",
    "then we provide a closed - form solution with a doubly exponential structure to the fixed point , and show that the fixed point can be decomposed into the product of two factors inflecting arrival information and service information . in section 4 , we provide an important observation in which the doubly exponential solution to the fixed point is not always unique for more general supermarket models .",
    "in section 5 , we study exponential convergence of the current location of the supermarket model to its fixed point . in section 6",
    ", we apply the kurtz theorem to study density dependent jump markov process given in the supermarket model with maps and ph service times , which leads to the lipschitz condition under which the fraction measure of the supermarket model weakly converges the system of differential vector equations .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section 7 .",
    "in this section , we first provide a supermarket model with maps and ph service times .",
    "then the supermarket model is described as a system of differential vector equations based on density dependent jump markov processes .",

    "each arriving customer chooses @xmath48 servers independently and uniformly at random from the @xmath49 servers , and waits for service at the server which currently contains the fewest number of customers .",

    "servers , width=377 ]    the following lemma , which is stated without proof , provides an intuitively sufficient condition under which the supermarket model is stable .",
    "note that this proof can be given by a simple comparison argument with the queueing system in which each customer queues at a random server ( i.e. , where @xmath4 ) .",
    "when @xmath4 , each server acts like a map / ph/1 queue which is stable if @xmath50 , see chapter 5 in neuts @xcite .",
    "the comparison argument is similar to those in winston @xcite and weber @xcite , thus we can obtain two useful results : ( 1 ) the shortest queue is optimal due to the assumptions on maps and ph service times ; and ( 2 ) the size of the longest queue in the supermarket model is stochastically dominated by the size of the longest queue in a set of @xmath49 independent map / ph/1 queues .    the supermarket model with maps and ph service times is stable if @xmath51    we define @xmath52 as the number of queues with at least @xmath2 customers who include the customer in service , the map in phase @xmath44 and the ph service time in phase @xmath32  at time @xmath53 .",

    "<S> in this paper , we provide a novel matrix - analytic approach for studying doubly exponential solutions of randomized load balancing models ( also known as _ supermarket models _ ) with markovian arrival processes ( maps ) and phase - type ( ph ) service times . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the supermarket model as a system of differential vector equations by means of density dependent jump markov processes , and obtain a closed - form solution with a doubly exponential structure to the fixed point of the system of differential vector equations . based on this </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the fixed point can be decomposed into the product of two factors inflecting arrival information and service information , and further find that the doubly exponential solution to the fixed point is not always unique for more general supermarket models . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we analyze the exponential convergence of the current location of the supermarket model to its fixed point , and apply the kurtz theorem to study density dependent jump markov process given in the supermarket model with maps and ph service times , which leads to the lipschitz condition under which the fraction measure of the supermarket model weakly converges the system of differential vector equations . </S>",
    "<S> this paper gains a new understanding of how workload probing can help in load balancing jobs with non - poisson arrivals and non - exponential service times </S>",
