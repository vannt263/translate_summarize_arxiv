    "after a fundamental nonclassical aspect of entanglement was recognized by einstein , podolsky , and rosen in 1935 @xcite , werner proposed the accurate definitions of separability and entanglement in 1989 @xcite . in recent years , with the rapid progress in quantum information science , it has become more and more clear that entanglement is a valuable quantum resource @xcite and acts as an important role in many other physical phenomenon such as quantum phase transition @xcite and efficient simulation of many body systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , many entanglement measures have been proposed in order to quantify it @xcite",
    ". however , separability and entanglement are not yet fully understood @xcite , and it is also necessary to present measures for separable states to show how unentangled the state is .    why to define separability measure ?",
    "one reason is that in many practical situations , people need to know how can we transform given separable states to entangled states .",
    "however , for typical entanglement measures , separable states always have zero entanglement . to distinguish the difference of each separable state",
    ", one needs a separability measure to show how unentangled a given separable state is .",
    "another reason is for the _ integrity _ of the entanglement measure theory .",
    "the separability measure is a natural complementarity for entanglement measure and can present detailed descriptions of separable states which , in the following , will be analytically explained in the two - qubit system .",
    "thirdly , quantitative investigation of entanglement dynamics involves both entangled and separable states .",
    "this is evident when we consider the sudden death and birth of entanglement in open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "similar situation occurs in the investigation of quantum phase transition by entanglement measures .    in this work",
    ", we define a negative entanglement measure ( nem ) , i.e. , separability measure for separable states which shows that how much entanglement one should pay at least for changing the unentangled state into an entangled state . based on this definition ,",
    "edge states of separable ( ess ) states are also introduced to describe the boundary between the separable and entangled states , and the necessary and sufficient condition of two - qubit ess states can be obtained via the nem .",
    "furthermore , for two - qubit systems , we obtain an explicit formula for the nem , and exact values or lower bounds for special classes of states in higher - dimensional systems are also presented , and the nem always vanishes for bipartite separable pure states .",
    "interestingly , the nem can be used to describe the quantum phase transition of the transverse ising model and the 1d bose - hubbard model with suitable parameters .",
    "the first derivative of nem in the transverse ising model diverges on approaching the critical value for the next - next - nearest neighboring sites , although this two - site reduced density matrix has no entanglement . and the nem as a function of @xmath0 in the 1d bose - hubbard model changes from zero to negative on approaching the critical point of quantum phase transition .",
    "another application is for entanglement dynamics @xcite .",
    "actually , a pioneer research using negative concurrence for entanglement dynamics has been done by yu and eberly @xcite .",
    "consider a bipartite system where the dimension of its hilbert space @xmath1 is finite , we can define the nem for separable states .    for a bipartite separable state @xmath2 , its negative entanglement is @xmath3 where the infimum is taken over all possible @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6",
    ", @xmath7 is an arbitrarily entangled bipartite state ) .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the entanglement measure concurrence or i concurrence for two - qubit system or higher - dimensional bipartite system , respectively .",
    "it is noticed that every separable state has non - positive value of nem .",
    "the absolute value of nem @xmath9 describes how much entanglement at least a separable state @xmath10 should mix with , in order to wipe out all separability of @xmath10 . on the contrary , any entangled state ( not necessarily normalized ) with less than @xmath9 entanglement",
    "must be changed into a separable state by mixing with @xmath10 .",
    "the definition of the nem can be viewed as a parallel definition of robustness of entanglement @xcite , since @xmath9 shows the robustness of separability .",
    "similar to robustness of entanglement , @xmath9 describes the robustness of the separability of @xmath10 , i.e. the amount of entanglement at least the separable state @xmath10 should mix with in order to wipe out all separability .",
    "therefore , the nem has its physical meaning and it can be regarded as complement to the entanglement measures , e.g. for describing quantum phase transition and entanglement dynamics .    the same idea can be used to define the ess states .",
    "a separable state @xmath2 is an edge state of separable states if , for arbitrary @xmath11 , there exists an entangled state @xmath7 such that @xmath12 is entangled .",
    "[ 1 ] demonstrates the nem and the ess states .",
    "a separable state @xmath10 , mixing with an entangled state @xmath5 , is changed into another entangled state @xmath13 .",
    "the infimum amount of mixed entanglement is defined as @xmath9 .",
    "it is also shown in fig . [ 1 ] that the ess state @xmath14 exactly lies in the boundary between the separable and the entangled states . furthermore , according to definitions 1 and 2 , one can obtain the following properties .",

    "the concurrence for a two - qubit state @xmath10 is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , and the @xmath25s are squared roots of eigenvalues of @xmath26 in the decreasing order @xcite . according to refs .",

    "( [ negative ] ) has a close relation with @xmath27 .    for a two - qubit separable state @xmath10 ,",
    "the exact value of nem is @xmath42    proof . since @xmath5 is an arbitrarily entangled two - qubit state , @xmath43 and @xmath23",
    ", one can obtain that @xmath44 and @xmath45 . according to lemma 1 ,",
    "the convex inequality is @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , @xmath47 holds . in the following",
    ", it will be proved that the infimum of @xmath48 is indeed @xmath49 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , every two - qubit separable state @xmath10 has the decomposition @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "( i ) if @xmath53 , for arbitrary @xmath11 , one can choose @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath6 for separable states ) , such that @xmath56 and @xmath57 hold .",
    "( ii ) if @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 as well . for arbitrary @xmath11 , one can choose @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 , such that @xmath64 and @xmath65 hold .",
    "therefore , the infimum of @xmath48 is indeed @xmath49 and the explicit formula for the nem in two - qubit systems is @xmath66 . @xmath41",
    "theorem 1 states that the quantity of entanglement a two - qubit separable state @xmath10 should mix with is at least @xmath67 , in order to wash out all the separability .",
    "in other words , the quantity of separability of @xmath10 is @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , theorem 1 also points out the relation between ess states and @xmath15 from its proof .    in two - qubit systems ,",
    "a separable state @xmath10 is an ess state if and only if @xmath68    proof .",
    "if a separable state @xmath10 satisfies @xmath15 , from the proof of theorem 1 there are two situations .",
    "( i ) if @xmath53 , for arbitrary @xmath11 , @xmath69 , there is an entangled state @xmath54 such that @xmath43 .",
    "( ii ) if @xmath58 , for arbitrary @xmath11 , @xmath63 , one can choose @xmath61 such that @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , if a separable state @xmath10 satisfies @xmath15 , it must be an ess state .",
    "the converse of the corollary is immediate from definitions 1 and 2 .",
    "@xmath41    remark . for higher - dimensional systems ,",
    "an ess state @xmath10 must satisfy @xmath15 , i.e. , eq . (",
    "[ necessary ] ) is still a necessary condition of ess states .    for two - qubit separable state @xmath10",
    ", @xmath9 does not increase on average under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) operations .",
    "this corollary can be proved directly following the proof of theorem 3 in @xcite .",
    "@xmath41    remark .",
    "corollary 2 shows a similar property as an entanglement monotone .",
    "let us demonstrate theorem 1 with a simple example .",
    "consider the separable state @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 . according to theorem 1 ,",
    "its nem is @xmath73 one can choose a special class of entangled states as @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath74 . when @xmath75 , the final state @xmath13 is entangled . therefore , in the special class of @xmath5 , @xmath76 .",
    "( i ) if @xmath77 , @xmath78 , i.e. , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are just the minimum of all @xmath6 and entangled states @xmath5 .",
    "( ii ) if @xmath81 , @xmath82 . @xmath79 and @xmath80 can not reach the minimum .",
    "actually , one can choose @xmath83 .",
    "when @xmath84 , @xmath22 is entangled , and @xmath85 .",
    "it means that @xmath86 and @xmath5 reach the minimum .",
    "numerical simulation also shows that the infimum of @xmath48 is @xmath9 for all @xmath6 and entangled states @xmath5 to get an entangled final state @xmath22 .    remark .",
    "according to definition 1 , arbitrarily close to some separable states are entangled states , and others are not .",
    "that is because we consider all the states in the hilbert space @xmath1 of the given separable state @xmath10 , and the same consideration has also been used in robustness of entanglement . for example , given a two - qubit separable state @xmath10 , we calculate eq .",
    "( 1 ) using all the entangled two - qubit states and find the infimum among all entangled two - qubit states . therefore",
    ", we obtain the infimum among all entangled states in the hilbert space of @xmath10 , which is similar to robustness of entanglement .",
    "the _ i _ concurrence of a bipartite pure state is defined as @xmath87 , where the reduced density matrix @xmath88 is obtained by tracing over the subsystem b @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the definition of _ i _ concurrence can be extended to mixed states @xmath10 by the convex roof , @xmath89 , for all possible decomposition into pure states , where @xmath90 and @xmath35 . although the generally explicit formula for _ i _ concurrence is still under research , for pure states and some special classes of states such as isotropic states the explicit formulas are available . in the following",
    ", we also present exact values and lower bounds of nem for pure separable states and separable isotropic states , respectively .",
    "the nem for pure separable states in bipartite systems is @xmath91    proof . for arbitrary pure separable state @xmath92 , one can select a new basis where @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the pure separable state @xmath10 can be written as @xmath95 and one can choose @xmath61 under the new basis . using the partial transposition criterion @xcite , it can be obtained that the final state @xmath96 is entangled for arbitrary @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the infimum of @xmath48 when @xmath61 is @xmath97 . on the other hand , @xmath98 for all separable states .",
    "hence , @xmath15 holds for arbitrary pure bipartite separable state @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath41    remark .",
    "theorem 2 shows that pure separable states can be changed into entangled states by mixing with an arbitrarily tiny amount of entanglement . from the proof",
    ", one can see that every separable pure state in bipartite systems is an ess state .",
    "isotropic states are a class of mixed states for @xmath99 systems , which can be expressed as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 , @xmath102 satisfying @xmath103 .",
    "rungta and caves @xcite have given an explicit formula for _ i _ concurrence of isotropic states , @xmath104 according to definition 1 , one can choose @xmath105 , and get a lower bound of nem of separable isotropic states , @xmath106 when @xmath107 .",
    "interestingly , the formula of this lower bound eq .",
    "( [ lower ] ) is just the same as concurrence of entangled isotropic states in eq .",
    "( [ crho ] ) .     when @xmath108 .",

    "it has been shown that entanglement can be used as a useful quantity to describe quantum phase transition and entanglement dynamics . however , in many specific physical models , the ground states are not always entangled , which greatly limits the scope of entanglement measures in these systems .",
    "this shortcoming can be amended by nem .",
    "actually , nem can be used in the investigation of quantum phase transition and entanglement dynamics even when there is no entanglement at all .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the concurrence of nearest - neighboring sites and next - nearest - neighboring sites has been used to exhibit a quantum phase transition in the xy model .",

    "( [ xy ] ) reduces to the ising model . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the concurrence of the reduced density matrix @xmath117 has been considered , where @xmath118 are positions of two spins , and @xmath119 because of translation invariance .",
    "it is shown that only nearest - neighboring sites ( @xmath120 ) and next - nearest - neighboring sites ( @xmath121 ) have entanglement , and all other pairs have zero two - party entanglement in the ising model @xcite .",
    "however , we can use the nem to describe all other pairs . in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. @xmath122",
    ", the reduced density matrix @xmath117 can be obtained by one- and two - point correlation functions , which have been shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can easily calculate the nem according to theorem 1 .",
    "[ 2 ] shows the nem and its first derivative as a function of @xmath109 of two sites when @xmath108 .",
    "these two sites have no entanglement indeed , and the first derivatives @xmath123 diverge on approaching the critical value @xmath110 , which are similar with @xmath124 shown in @xcite .",

    "another example of investigating quantum phase transition by the nem is the 1d bose - hubbard model with suitable parameters .",

    ", the reduced density matrix @xmath117 can be numerically simulated by the itebd algorithm , a recently developed method related to density matrix renormalization group techniques @xcite .",

    "[ 3 ] shows the nem as a function of @xmath0 when @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "these two sites have no entanglement indeed , and the nem changes from zero to non - zero on approaching the critical value @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , the nem can be regarded as complement to the concurrence .",
    "the nem can also be used in entanglement dynamics @xcite .",
    "yu and eberly have done a pioneer research of two - qubit entanglement dynamics using negative concurrence @xcite , which they used is actually nem according to theorem 1 .",
    "they have shown that nem can signal whether the disentanglement of an entangled state occurs in a finite time , and the final value of nem generally depends on the system s initial state under fully disentangling evolution , whereas a disentangled concurrence must have the value @xmath97 no matter what the initial state was .",
    "therefore , one can obtain much more information in the evolution using nem and concurrence than using concurrence only .",
    "the discussions in this work can be interestingly generalized . from definition 1",
    ", it is realized that one can define nem for multipartite separable states by choosing a proper multipartite entanglement measure instead of concurrence in eq .",
    "( [ negative ] ) .",
    "furthermore , for bipartite separable states , we can also use other entanglement measures instead of @xmath8 in definition 1 , such as the entanglement of formation @xcite , relative entropy of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the different entanglement measures describe different ways to quantify entanglement , and @xmath9 always denotes , under the chosen way of entanglement quantification , how much entanglement at least the separable state @xmath10 should mix with to wipe out all separability of @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , one can use a special entanglement measure @xmath136 or @xmath137 for separable or entangled states , respectively , and definition 1 becomes a parallel definition of robustness of entanglement @xcite .",
    "last but not least , it is worth noticing that the relative entropy is a well defined distance measure @xcite , and it would give an alternative way of defining a negative entanglement measure , by using the distance to the closest entangled state .",
    "unfortunately , it is quite difficult to obtain the exact value of negative entanglement measure using relative entropy , even in the two - qubit system .",
    "therefore , using relative entropy , a similar theorem to theorem 1 is not available at present , but it is interesting and worth for further research .    in conclusion",
    ", we have defined the nem for separable states which shows that how much entanglement one should pay at least for changing the unentangled state to an entangled state .",
    "the quantification describes how unentangled every separable state is .",
    "another definition of ess states has been given to describe the boundary between the separable and entangled states , and we have also shown the close relation between ess states and the nem .",
    "furthermore , one can obtain an explicit formula for the nem in two - qubit systems , and exact values or lower bounds for special class of states in higher - dimensional systems , and the nem always vanishes for bipartite separable pure states .",
    "interestingly , the proposed measures can also be used to investigate entanglement dynamics and quantum phase transition in many - body systems , although in this case the considered system has no entanglement .",
    "entanglement is not the only quantity which signals the critical point of a quantum phase transition .",
    "therefore , detailed discussion of the separability and entanglement in this specific physical systems will give a deeper insight into such novel phenomena .",
