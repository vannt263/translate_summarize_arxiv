    "a main problem of technical application of superconductors consists in that their critical temperatures @xmath0 are considerably lower than room temperature .",
    "the critical temperature depends on an effective coupling with some collective excitations @xmath1 ( here @xmath2 is a density of states at fermi level , @xmath3 is an interaction constant ) and on energy of the collective excitations @xmath4",
    ". most often a phonon mechanism results in superconductivity , then @xmath5 is an electron - phonon coupling constant ( in most cases @xmath6 ) , and @xmath4 is a characteristic phonon frequency @xmath7 ( here @xmath8 ) .",
    "the larger coupling constant , the larger critical temperature . at large @xmath5",
    "( as a rule for @xmath9 ) we have following expressions for the critical temperature @xcite : @xmath10 formally the critical temperature can be made arbitrarily large by increasing the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath11 .",
    "however , in order to reach room temperature such values of the coupling constant are necessary , which are not possible in real materials .",
    "moreover we can increase the frequency @xmath4 due nonphonon pairing mechanisms , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "however with increasing of the frequency the coupling constant decreases as @xmath12 , therefore @xmath13 many different types of superconducting materials with a wide variety of electron pairing mechanisms exist , however all they have the critical temperature limited by values @xmath14 , despite the fact that the highly exotic mechanisms have been proposed . in a present work we propose a fundamentally different approach to the problem of room - temperature superconductivity .",
    "this approach is not associated with increasing of the coupling constant or with change of the frequency , but it allows to circumvent the problem in the sense that , having the interaction of conventional intensity ( which generates an energy gap @xmath15 ) , we change ratio between the gap and the critical temperature as @xmath16 instead of a finite value @xmath17 for presently known materials .",
    "first of all we propose a principal possibility to increase the critical temperature due to generalization of bcs model in the following sense : let us consider a system of fermions with hamiltonian : @xmath18      \\equiv \\widehat{h}_{\\texttt{bcs}}+\\widehat{h}_{\\texttt{ext}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is bcs hamiltonian - kinetic energy + pairing interaction ( @xmath20 ) , energy @xmath21 is counted from fermy surface .",
    "the term @xmath22 is the external pair potential or `` source term '' @xcite .",
    "for example , in ferromagnetism a term @xmath23 - the energy of a spin in an external magnetic field plays a role the source term @xmath22 .",

    "the multipliers @xmath31 and @xmath32 are introduced into @xmath22 in order that the energy does not depend on the phase @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) . thus both @xmath19 and @xmath22 is invariant under the @xmath35 transformation unlike the source term in @xcite where it has a noninvariant form @xmath36 $ ] .",

    "it should be noted that if @xmath56 then for any @xmath37 a superconducting state does not exist ( @xmath57 always ) .",
    "this means electron - electron coupling is the cause of the transition to superconducting state only but not the external pair potential @xmath37 .",

    "@xcite the following result has been obtained . for noninteracting electrons",
    "the hopping tends to distribute the electrons randomly over the molecular levels .",

    "superconductivity remains , however , even for @xmath112 , and @xmath0 drops surprisingly slowly as @xmath87 is increased .",
    "the reason is that local pairing arises from correlation of spin and orbital structures within each site , and therefore it is not suppressed by the charge interaction .",
    "superconductivity is expected to exist in this material right up to the mott transition .",
    "+ this situation is very different from eliashberg theory .",
    "we can see , because of the local pairing , the coulomb interaction enters very differently for jahn - teller and non - jahn - teller models , and it can not be easily described by a coulomb pseudopotential : @xmath113 .    .",

    "this situation is fundamentally different from superconductivity in metals , where the size of a cooper pair is macroscopic quantity @xmath120 .",
    "let us consider some features of the molecular structure @xmath97",
    ". the van der waals radius of a carbon atom is @xmath121 .",
    "thus a fullerene has an inner cavity in its center the size of @xmath122 .",
    "a noble gas atom @xmath116 can be trapped in a carbon cage in the inner cavity ( fig.[fig2 ] ) - we have endohedral complexes @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "since for a helium atom @xmath124 the atom interacts with the carbon cage by van der waals interaction only and it s electronic shell does not make hybridized orbitals with electronic shells of the carbon cage .",
    "if a helium atom is placed into each fullerene molecule in alkali - doped fullerenes then we have hypothetical material @xmath125 .",
    "electronic properties of @xmath125 must be exactly the same as electronic properties of @xmath75 .",
    "changes in oscillation spectrum of a fullerene can be neglected .    as noted above , in an endohedral fullerene",
    "the noble gas atom interacts with a carbon cage by van der waals force .",
    "as is well known van der waals interaction depends on electronic configuration of interacting subsystems . in alkali - doped fullerenes",
    "alkali metal atoms give valent electrons to fullerene molecules .",
    "then energy of the van der waals interaction has to depend on a state of the excess electrons on the surface of a molecule @xmath97 .",
    "any two electrons can be in the paired state ( [ 3.1 ] ) or in the normal state ( [ 3.1a ] ) .",
    "let this energy for the paired state is @xmath126 and the energy for the normal state is @xmath127 . if @xmath128 then the paired state is more energetically favorable than the normal state : a molecule @xmath129 has lower energy if the excess electrons are in the paired state than the energy if the electrons are in the normal state ( if we turn off the electron - electron interaction ) . on the other hand",
    "as noted above for noninteracting electrons the hopping @xmath86 tends to distribute the electrons randomly over the molecular levels thus destroying the local pairs .",
    "however the relationship @xmath128 makes more energetically favorable to place electrons in a state ( [ 3.1 ] ) with the same quantum numbers @xmath95 and thus it confronts the destruction of local pairs by the hopping .",
    "hence a function @xmath130 plays the role of the external pair potential .",
    "the van der waals interaction is interaction due to virtual transitions of the cooper pair from a triply degenerated level @xmath77 ( @xmath131 ) to levels @xmath132 ( @xmath131 ) , @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) , @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) @xcite , where @xmath137 is an orbital index for @xmath138-electrons ( we can use a state @xmath139 instead of the state ( [ 3.1 ] ) for simplicity , because the result will not depend on the quantum number @xmath95 ) : @xmath140\\equiv\\phi_{k\\uparrow\\downarrow},\\ ] ] and of the helium atom from a level @xmath141 to levels @xmath142 : @xmath143\\equiv\\psi_{p},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath144 labels irreducible representation of icosahedral symmetry group ; @xmath145 are principal quantum number , orbital quantum number and magnetic quantum number accordingly ; @xmath146 is a radial wave function , @xmath147 is a spherical wave functions . @xmath148 and @xmath149 are ground - states of a cooper pair and a helium atom accordingly .",

    "signs `` + '' in the sums are caused by the fact that the ground states of both the cooper pair and the helium atom are singlet , and transitions between singlet and triplet states are allowed only when there is the spin - orbit interaction , but this interaction can be neglected .",

    "moreover we can neglect the exchange processes between the helium atom and electrons on the molecule s surface , that can not be done , for example , for atoms @xmath174 and @xmath175 due to a not small overlap of the atom s wave functions with the wave functions of electrons on the fullerene cage @xcite . in this work",
