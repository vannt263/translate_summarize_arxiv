    "log - riemann surfaces were defined and studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where it was shown that the map @xmath31 restricted to any small enough punctured metric neighbourhood of a point @xmath33 in @xmath19 gives a covering of a punctured disc in @xmath30 , and is thus equivalent to either @xmath34 restricted to a punctured disc @xmath35 ( in which case we say @xmath33 is a ramification point of order @xmath1 ) or to @xmath36 restricted to a half - plane @xmath37 ( in which case we say @xmath33 is a ramification point of infinite order ) .    a log - riemann surface is said to be of finite type if it has finitely many ramification points and finitely generated fundamental group .",
