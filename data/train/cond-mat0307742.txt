    "in biological systems , the survival of a species depends on the frequencies of its kin and its foes in the environment @xcite . in some cases",
    ", the chance of survival of a certain species _ improves _ as the frequency of its kind increases , since this might enhance the chance for reproduction or other benefits from group interaction .",
    "this is denoted as _ positive _ frequency dependence . in other cases",
    "a _ negative _ frequency dependence , that is the increase of the survival chance with _ decreasing _ frequency , is observed .",
    "this is the case , when individuals compete for rare ressources .",
    "moreover , negative frequency dependence is known to be important for maintaining the genetic diversity in natural populations @xcite .",
    "frequency dependent dynamics are not only found in biological systems , but also in social and economic systems @xcite . in democracies , a simple example is a public vote , where the winning chances of a party increase with the number of supporters @xcite . in economics ,",
    "e.g. the acceptance of a new products may increase with the number of its users @xcite . in stock markets ,",
    "on the other hand , positive and negative frequency dependencies may interfere .",
    "for instance , the desire to buy a certain stock may increase with the orders observed from others , a phenomenon known as the _ herding effect _ , but it also may decrease , because traders fear speculative bubbles .    in general",
    ", many biological and socio - economic processes are governed by the frequency dependent adoption of a certain behavior or strategy , or simply by frequency dependent reproduction . in order to model such dynamics more rigorously ( but less concrete ) , different versions of _ voter models _ have been investigated .",
    "the voter model denotes a simple binary system comprised of @xmath1 _ voters _ , each of which can be in one of two states ( where _ state _ could stand for opinion , attitude , or occupation etc . ) , @xmath2 . here",
    ", the transition rate @xmath3 from state @xmath4 to state @xmath5 is assumed to be proportional to the frequency @xmath6 . in this paper , we extend this approach by assuming a _ nonlinear _ voter model , where the frequency dependence of the transition rate , @xmath7 , includes an additional nonlinearity expressed in terms of the ( frequency dependent ) prefactor @xmath8 .",
    "linear voter models have been discussed for a long time in mathematics @xcite .",
    "recently , they gained more attention in statistical physics @xcite because of some remarkable features in their dynamics described in sect .",
    "[ sec : vm ] .",
    "but voter models also found the interest of population biologists @xcite    dependent on how the frequency @xmath6 is estimated , one can distinguish global from local voter models . in the latter case",
    "the transition is governed only by the local frequency of a certain state in a given neighborhood .",
    "in contrast to global ( or mean - field ) models , this leads to local effects in the dynamics , which are of particular interest in the current paper .",
    "if space is represented by a two - dimenional lattice and each site is occupied by just one individual , then each species occupies an amount of space proportional to its presence in the total population .",
    "local effects such as the occupation of a neighborhood by a particular species or the adoption of a given opinion in a certain surrounding , can then be observed graphically in terms of domain formation .",
    "this way , the invasion of species ( or opinions ) in the environment displays obvious analogies to spatial pattern formation in physical systems .",
    "physicists have developed different spatial models for such processes .",
    "one recent example is the so - called `` sznajd model '' @xcite which is a simple cellular automata ( ca ) approach to consensus formation ( i.e. complete invasion ) among two opposite opinions ( described by spin up or down ) . in @xcite , we have shown that the sznajd model can be completely reformulated in terms of a linear voter model , where the transition rates towards a given opinion are directly proportional to the frequency of the respective opinion of the _ second - nearest _ neighbors and independent of the nearest neighbors .    other spatial models are proposed for game - theoretical interactions among nearest neighbors @xcite . here",
    ", the dynamics are driven by local payoff differences of adjacent players , which basically determine the nonlinearity @xmath9 .",
    "dependent on these payoff differences , we could derive a phase diagram with five regimes , each characterized by a distinct spatio - temporal dynamic @xcite .",
    "the corresponding spatial patterns range from complete invasion to coexistence with large domains , coexistence with small clusters , and spatial chaos .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the local effects of frequency dependent dynamics in a homogeneous network , where each site has @xmath0 nearest neighbors . in this case",
    ", the nonlinearity @xmath9 can be simply expressed by two constants , @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "this is a special form of a nonlinear voter model , which for @xmath12 also includes majority voting and for @xmath13 minority voting .",
    "we investigate the dynamics of this model both analytically and by means of computer simulations on a two - dimensional stochastic ca ( which is a special form of a homogeneous network with @xmath0 ) .",
    "the latter one was already studied in @xcite , in particular there was a phase diagram obtained via numerical simulations . in our paper , we go beyond that approach by deriving the phase diagram from an analytical approximation , which is then compared with our own simulations .    in sects .",
    "[ sec : formal ] , [ sec : micro ] we introduce the microscopic model of frequency dependent invasion and demonstrate in sects .",
    "[ sec : a1a2 ] , [ 2.4 ] the role of @xmath10 , @xmath11 by means of characteristic pattern formation . based on the microscopic description , in sect .",
    "[ 3.1 ] we derive the dynamics for the global frequency @xmath14 , which is a macroscopic key variable .",
    "an analytical investigation of these dynamics is made possible by pair approximation , sect .",

    "[ 4.1 ] , we verify the performance of our analytical approximations by comparing them with averaged ca computer simulations .",
    "the outcome of the comparison allows us to derive in sect .",
    "[ 4.3 ] a phase diagram in the @xmath16 parameter space , to distinguish between two possible dynamic scenarious : ( i ) complete invasion of one of the species , with formation of domains at intermediate time scales , and ( ii ) random spatial coexistence of two species .",
    "a third dynamic regime , the nonstationary coexistence of the two species on long time scales together with the formation of spatial domains , can be found in a small , but extended region that separates the two dynamic regimes mentioned above .",
    "we further discuss in sect . [ 5 ] that the usual distinctions for the dynamics , such as positive or negative frequency dependence , do not necessarily coincide with the different dynamic regimes . instead , for positive frequency dependence ,",
    "all of the three different dynamic regimes ( and the related spatio - temporal patterns ) are observed . in the appendix , calculation details for the pair approximation",
    "are given .",
    "we consider a model of two species labeled by the index @xmath17 .",
    "the total number of individuals is constant , so the global frequency @xmath18 ( or the share of each species in the total population ) is defined as : @xmath19 in the following , the variable @xmath20 shall refer to the global frequency of species 1 .",
    "the individuals of the two species are identified by the index @xmath21 and can be seen as nodes of a network .",
    "a discrete value @xmath22 indicates whether the node is occupied by species 0 or 1 .",
    "the network topology ( specified later ) then defines the nearest neighbors @xmath23 of node @xmath24 . in this paper , we assume homogeneous networks where all nodes have the same number @xmath25 of nearest neighbors . for further use , we define the local occupation @xmath26 of the nearest neighborhood ( without node @xmath24 ) as : @xmath27 a specific realization of this distribution shall be denoted as @xmath28 , while the function @xmath29 assigns @xmath28 to a particular neighborhood @xmath26 : @xmath30 for later use , it is convenient to define these distributions also for the nearest neighborhood _ including _",
    "node @xmath24 : @xmath31 for @xmath0 , @xmath32 denotes a binary string , e.g. @xmath33 , where the first value @xmath34 refers to the center node and the other values @xmath35 indicate the particular values of the nearest neighbors .",
    "the assignment of these values to a particular neighborhood @xmath36 of node @xmath24 is then described by @xmath37 .    in the voter model described in the following section , the dynamics of @xmath38",
    "is governed by the _ occupation distribution _ of the _ local neighborhood_. that surrounds each node @xmath24 .",
    "using a stochastic approach , the probability @xmath39 to find node @xmath24 in state @xmath38 therefore depends in general on the local occupation distribution @xmath26 of the neigborhood ( eqn .",
    "( [ occupat ] ) , in the following manner : @xmath40 hence , @xmath39 is defined as the marginal distribution of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : marg_dist ] ) indicates the summation over all possible realizations of the local occupation distribution @xmath26 , namely @xmath43 different possibilities .    for the time",
    "dependent change of @xmath39 we assume the following master equation : @xmath44\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 denotes the transition rate for state @xmath46 of node @xmath24 into state @xmath38 in the next time step under the condition that the local occupation distribution is given by @xmath26 . the transition rate for the reverse process is @xmath47 .",
    "again , the summation is over all possible realizations of @xmath26 , denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "it remains to specify the transition rates , which is done in the following section .",
    "our dynamic assumptions for the change of an individual state @xmath38 are taken from the so - called voter model ( see also sect . [ 1 ] ) , abbreviated as vm in the following .",
    "the dynamics is given by the following update rule : a voter , i.e. a node @xmath48 of the network , is selected at random and adopts the state of a randomly chosen nearest neighbor @xmath49 .",
    "after @xmath1 such update events , time is increased by 1 .",
    "the probability to choose a voter with a given state @xmath34 from the neighborhood @xmath23 of voter @xmath24 is directly proportional to the relative number ( or frequency ) of voters with that particular state in that neigborhood .",
    "let us define the _ local frequencies _ in the neighborhood as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the kronecker delta , which is 1 only for @xmath52 and zero otherwise .",
    "then the transition rate of voter @xmath24 to change its state @xmath38 does not explicitly depend on the local distribution @xmath26 , but only on the _ occupation frequency _ @xmath53 , i.e. on the number of nodes occupied by either 0 or 1 in the neighborhood of size @xmath25 .",
    "hence , the vm describes a frequency dependent dynamics : the larger the frequency of a given state in the neighborhood , the larger the probability of a voter to switch to that particular state _ if _ it is not already in that state .",
    "i.e. the transition rate @xmath54 , to _ change _ state @xmath5 increases only with the local frequency of _ opposite _ states , @xmath55 , in the neighborhood : @xmath56 the prefactor @xmath57 determines the time scale of the transitions and is set to @xmath58 .",
    "( [ eq : linvm ] , describes the dynamics of the _ linear _ vm because , according to the above update rule , the rate to _ change _ the state is directly proportional to the frequency .    the linear ( or standard ) vm has two remarkable features .",
    "first , it is known that , starting from a random distribution of states , the system always reaches a completely ordered state , which is often referred to as _ consensus _ in a social context , or complete _ invasion _ in a population biology context . as there are individuals with two different states , the complete ordered state can be either all 0 or all 1 . which of these two possible attractors of the dynamics is eventually reached , depends ( in addition to stochastic fluctuations ) on the initial global frequency , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "it has been shown that , for an ensemble average , the frequency of the outcome of a particular consensus state @xmath60 is equal to the initial frequency @xmath59 of state @xmath60 .",
    "this second remarkable feature is often denoted as conservation of magnetization , where the magnetization is defined as @xmath61 .",
    "hence , consensus means @xmath62 .",
    "thus we have the interesting situation that , for a single realization , the dynamics of the linear vm is a fluctuation driven process that , for finite system sizes , always reaches consensus , whereas on average the outcome of the consensus state is distributed as @xmath63 .",
    "the ( only ) interesting question for the linear vm is then how long it may take the system to reach the consensus state , dependent on the system size @xmath1 and the network topology .",
    "the time to to reach consensus , @xmath64 , is obtained through an average over many realizations . as the investigation of @xmath64 is not the focus of our paper ( see @xcite ) ,",
    "we just mention some known results for the linear vm : one finds for one - dimensional regular lattices ( @xmath65 ) @xmath66 and for two - dimensional regular lattices ( @xmath67 ) @xmath68 . for @xmath69",
    "the system does not always reach an ordered state in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in finite systems , however , one finds @xmath70 .",
    "while the linear vm has some nice theoretical properties , it also has several conceptual disadvantages when applying the model to a social or population biological context .",
    "first of all , the `` voters '' do not vote in this model , they are subject to a random ( but frequency based ) assignment of an `` opinion '' , without any choice . secondly , the state of the voter under consideration does not play any role in the dynamics .",
    "this can be interpreted in a social context as a ( blind ) herding dynamics , where the individuals just adopt the opinion of the majority . in a population model of two competing species , it means that individuals from a minority species may be replaced by those from a majority species without any resistance .    in order to give voter @xmath24 at least some weight compared to the influence of its neighbors @xmath23 , one can simply count its state @xmath38 into the local frequency @xmath53 , i.e. instead of eqs .",
    "( [ occupat ] ) , ( [ sigm01 ] ) we may use eqn . ( [ occupat0 ] ) . using for voter @xmath24 the notation @xmath71 ( i.e @xmath72 )",
    ", we can still use eqn .",
    "( [ eq : linvm ] ) for the transition rates , with the noticable difference that the local frequency @xmath53 of eqn .",
    "( [ sum ] ) is now calculated from a summation that starts with @xmath73 .",
    "the explicit consideration of @xmath38 thus has the effect of adding some _ inertia _ to the dynamics .",
    "in fact , extending the summation to @xmath73 multiplies the transition rate , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : linvm ] ) , by a factor @xmath74 , where @xmath25 is the number of nearest neighbors .",
    "i.e. , for @xmath0 a local configuration @xmath75 would lead to a transition rate @xmath76 _ without _ the additional inertia , but @xmath77 by counting in the state of voter @xmath24 .",
    "i.e. , taking into account the state of voter @xmath24 considerably reduces the transition rate towards the opposite state .",
    "we find it useful for conceptual reasons to include some resistance into the model and therefore will use from now on the description which takes the current state of voter @xmath24 into account .",
    "this also has the nice advantage that for the case @xmath0 , which describes e.g. square lattices , we avoid stalemate situations , @xmath78 .",
    "however , we note that the addition of the constant resistance does not change the dynamics of the model , as it only adjusts the _ time scale _ towards a new factor @xmath79 .",
    "so , keeping @xmath25 constant and equal for all voters , we can rescale @xmath80 .",
    "we note that there are of course other ways to give some weight to the opinion of voter @xmath24 . in @xcite , we have discussed a modified vm , where voters additionally have an inertia @xmath81 $ ] which leads to a decrease of the transition rate to change their state : @xmath82 here @xmath83 is given by the linear vm , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : linvm ] ) .",
    "the individual inertia @xmath84 is evolving over time by assuming that it increases with the persistence time @xmath85 the voter has been keeping its current state .",
    "while this intertia may slow down the microscopic dynamics of the vm and thus may increase the time to reach consensus , @xmath64 , we found the counterintuitive result that under certain circumstances a decelerated microdynamics may even accelerate the macrodynamics of the vm , thus decreasing @xmath64 compared to the linear vm .",
    "the addition of a nonlinear inertia to the vm , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : reluc ] ) , is a special case for turning the linear vm into a nonlinear one ( wheras the fixed resistence would not change the linear vm ) . in general ,",
    "nonlinear vm can be expressed as @xmath86 where @xmath9 is a nonlinear , frequency dependent function describing how voter @xmath24 reacts on the occurence of opposite `` opinions '' in its immediate neighborhood .",
    "[ fig : nonlin ] shows some possible examples which have their specific meaning in a social context .",
    "whereas any function @xmath87 describes the linear vm , i.e. a majority voting or herding effect , a decreasing @xmath9 means minority voting , i.e. the voter tends to adopt the opinion of the minority .",
    "nonmonotonous @xmath9 can account for voting against the trend , i.e. the voter adopts an opinion as long as this is not already the ruling opinion  a phenomenon which is important e.g. in modeling the adoption of fashion .",
    "an interpretation of these functions in a population biology context will be given in sect .",
    "[ sec : a1a2 ]    in conclusion , introducing the nonlinear response function @xmath9 will allow us to change the global dynamics of the linear vm . instead of reaching always consensus , i.e. the exclusive domination of one `` opinion '' or species",
    ", we may be able to observe some more interesting macroscopic dynamics , for example the coexistence of both states .",

    "in order to give a complete picture of the dynamics of the nonlinear vm , we have to derive the stochastic dynamics for the _ whole _ system of @xmath1 nodes , whereas eqn .",

    "however , in the frequency dependent dynamics introduced in sect .",
    "[ 2.1 ] , only the occupation distribution of the _ local _ neighborhood of node @xmath24 needs to be taken into account .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate to think about some reduced description in terms of lower order distributions , such as the local occupation @xmath26 , eqn .",
    "( [ occupat ] ) . in principle",
    ", there are two different ways to solve this task . the first one , the _ top - down _ approach starts from the _ global _ distribution @xmath96 in the whole state space and then uses different approaches to factorize @xmath92 .",
    "however , a markov analysis @xcite can only be carried out exactly for small @xmath1 , because of the exponential @xmath1-dependence of the state space .",
    "thus , for larger @xmath1 suitable approximations , partly derived from theoretical concepts in computer science need to be taken into account .    in this paper ,",
    "we follow a second way which is a _ bottom - up _ approach based on the _ local _ description already given in sect . [ 2.1 ] .",

    "[ stoch ] , [ x - t ] ) .",
    "i.e. , the system converges into a frozen state with no dynamics at all .",
    "the region to the right of the separatrix refers to _ random coexistence _ of both species with @xmath251 and _ no _ local correlations , i.e. @xmath253 . in the ca simulations , we observe _ nonstationary _ random patterns that change with high frequency ( cf .",
    "[ random ] ) .",
    "both regions are divided by a _",
    "separatrix_. as shown in fig .",
    "[ phasepl ] ( top ) , the separatrix is divided into two pieces by the linear voter point , ( 0.2,0.4 ) . above that point",
    ", the separatrix is very narrow , but below the voter point it has in fact a certain extension in the parameter space .",
    "looking at the dynamics _ on _ the separatrix , we find that the mean frequency is @xmath251 both above and below the voter point ( see also fig .",

    "the local correlation @xmath266 holds within the whole extended area of the separatrix which identifies it as the region of _ correlated coexistence _",
    "( see also fig .",
    "[ variat ] , bottom ) .",
    "the question is how well this phase diagram can be predicted by using the pair approximation of the dynamics , described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : master2d ] ) , ( [ eq : master2dc ] ) . for a comparison",
    ", the coupled equations were numerically solved to get the asymptotic solutions for @xmath263 ( which looks complicated but is numerically very fast and efficient ) . in order to distinguish between the three regimes , we have to define a critical @xmath138 value for the correlations .",
    "whereas in the ca simulations @xmath266 indicated a correlated nonstationary coexistence , this value was never reached using the pair approximation ( see fig .",
    "[ variat ] , bottom ) , so @xmath267 could be regarded as an _ upper limit _ for the case of correlated coexistence . random coexistence , on the other end , yielded @xmath253 in the ca simulations and a value between 0.4 and 0.6 in the pair approximation .",
    "so , given suitable initial conditions , we can regard @xmath268 as a _",
    "lower limit _ , to identify correlated coexistence .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ phasepl ] ( bottom ) which shall be compared with the phase diagram above ( fig .",

    "[ phasepl ] ( bottom ) shows the influence of the @xmath138 threshold value . with the lower limit",
    ", we find a quite broad region of correlated coexistence , which for example also includes the point @xmath269 for which a random coexistence in the ca simulations was shown in fig .",
    "[ random ] . using the upper limit @xmath258 results in a much smaller region of correlated coexistence . comparing this with the ca simulations above",
    ", we can verify that the pair approximation correctly predicts the extended region below the voter point and also shows how it becomes more narrow above the voter point .",
    "one should note that the left border of the separatrics is not affected by the threshold value , whereas the right border shifts considerably .",
    "the left border also contains the voter point ( independent of the @xmath138 threshold value ) , for which a complete invasion can be observed .",
    "therefore , it is quite interesting to look into changes of the phase diagram if additional perturbations are considered ( see also sect .",
    "[ sec : pertub ] ) .",
    "[ phasepl ] ( bottom ) shows ( for the threshold @xmath270 ) that this does _ not _ affects the existence of the three dynamic regimes and most notably of the extended separatrix below the voter point , but only shifts the boundaries toward the left , dependent on the value of @xmath231 ( this can be also verified for @xmath258 but is omitted here , to keep the figure readable ) .",
    "thus , the consideration of perturbations in the phase diagram reveals that it is indeed the _",
    "nonlinearity _ in the voter model which allows for the interesting phenomenon of the correlated coexistence and _ not _ just the perturbation .    a closer look into fig .",
    "[ phasepl ] ( bottom ) also shows that in the perturbated phase diagram the voter point no longer lies on the boundary towards the region of complete invasion but clearly _ within _ the region of correlated coexististence .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings in sect .",
    "[ sec : pertub ] which showed that for the linear vm complete invasion is an unstable phenomenon and changes into correlated coexistence for finite @xmath235 .",
    "in this paper , we investigated a local model of frequency dependent processes , which for example models the dynamics of two species @xmath195 in a spatial environment .",
    "individuals of these species ( also called voters ) are seen as nodes of a network assumed as homogeneous in this paper ( i.e. all nodes have the same number of neighbors , @xmath25 ) . the basic assumption for the microscopic dynamics",
    "is that the probability to occupy a given node with either species @xmath113 or @xmath60 depends on the frequency of this species in the immediate neighborhood .",
    "different from other investigations , we have counted in the state of the center node as well ( see sect . [ sec : vm ] ) and have further considered a _ nonlinear response _ of the voters to the local frequencies .",
    "studies of a nonlinear version of the traditional voter model ( without counting the state of the central node and with sequential dynamics ) have already been analyzed before .",

    "[ phasepl ] ( top ) .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , have provided a markov analysis which is restricted only to very small ca .",
    "the two - parameter model in @xcite is for @xmath271 a nonlinear voter model that exhibits at the voter point ( @xmath272 ) a transition from a ferromagnetic phase , i.e. invasion , for @xmath273 to a paramagnetic phase ( correlated coexistence ) for @xmath274 . also",
    "the case of the perturbated linear voter model is included in the model , for @xmath272 and @xmath275 .",
    "similar results are also presented in @xcite , which points out relations to random branching processes , and in @xcite , where the emphasis is on investigations of the interface density , to describe the coarsening process .",
    "a recent paper @xcite also shows for spin systems with two symmetric absorbing states ( such as the vm ) that the macroscopic dynamics only depends on the first derivatives of the spin - flip probabilities .    in our paper",
    ", we set out for a formal approach that allows to derive the dynamics on different levels : ( i ) a _ stochastic dynamics _ on the microlevel , which is used for reference computer simulations but also allows a derivation of the ( ii ) _ macroscopic dynamics _ for the key variables , given in terms of differential equations .",
    "this macroscopic dynamics is then analysed by two different approximations , ( i ) a _ mean - field approximation _ that neglects any local interaction in the network , and ( ii ) a _ local approximation _ considering correlations between pairs of nearest neighbors . in order to test the validity of these approximations",
    ", we compare their preditions with the averaged outcome of the microscopic computer simulations .",
    "we like to emphasize that our approach is general enough to be applied to various forms of _ frequency dependent processes _ on homogeneous networks with different number of neighbors .",
    "even if a two - dimensional regular lattice is used to illustrate the dynamics , the approach is not restricted to that .",
    "our main result , in addition to the general framework for nonlinear frequency dependent processes , is the derivation of a _ phase diagram _ using the _ pair approximation _ derived in this paper .",
    "this approach predicts correctly both the type of the dynamics and the asymptotic values of the key variables dependent on the possible nonlinearities for the case of _ local interaction _ , @xmath0 .",
    "the predicted phase diagram was verified by comparision with extensive microscopic computer simulations rastering the whole parameter space .",
    "while the structure of the phase diagram was already known from previous computer simulations presented in @xcite we could demonstrate that the pair approximation works very well both for predicting the correct phase boundaries and the dynamics within these phases .",
    "it should be noticed that the pair approximation is a valuable tool , particularly with respect to computational efforts .",
    "the computer simulations are much more timeconsuming , since the results of the different runs have to be averaged afterwards .",
    "the pair approximation , on the other hand , is based on only 2 coupled equations and therefore needs less computational effort . in the following ,",
    "we discuss some of the interesting findings .",
    "_ the region of correlated coexistence : _ analysing the nonlinear vm with _ local interaction _ has shown that there are in fact only _ three _ different dynamic regimes dependent on the nonlinearities @xmath16 : ( i ) complete invasion , ( ii ) random coexistence , and ( iii ) correlated coexistence . the first one is already known as the standard behavior of the _ linear _ vm .",
    "consequently the only interesting feature , namely the time to reach the ordered state dependent on the network size and topology , has been the subject of many investigations @xcite .",
    "number ( ii ) , on the other hand , only leads to trivial results as no real dynamics is observed .",
    "thus , the most interesting regime is ( iii ) correlated coexistence , which can be found in a small , but not negligible parameter region below the voter point .",
    "this region separates the two dominant regimes ( i ) and ( ii ) and therefore was called a separatrix here . going over from the right to the left side of the phase diagram in that region",
    ", we notice a transition from 0.5 to 1.0 ( or 0.0 respectively ) in the mean frequency , and from 0.5 to 0.7 to 1.0 in the local correlations .",
    "thus , in fact @xmath138 separates the two dynamic regimes ( i ) and ( ii ) ( below the voter point ) . for parameters chosen from that region",
    ", we find in the ca simulations a long - term and nonstationary _ coexistence _ between the two species as on the _ right _ side of the phase diagram .",
    "but we also find the long - range spatial correlations that lead to the formation of spatial domains as shown e.g. in fig .",
    "[ posit ]  which is characteristic for the _ left _ side of the phase diagram .",
    "the spatial pattern formation is also indicated by large fluctuations of @xmath122 shown in fig . [",
    "variat](top ) . a single run , as shown in fig .",
    "[ x - t-2 ] , clearly indicates the long - term nonstationary coexistence of both species .",
    "we emphasize that the separatrix between the two dynamic regimes is well predicted by the macroscopic dynamics resulting from the pair approximation ( as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ phasepl ] ) .",
    "most importantly , we could verify that the correlated coexistence of both species is not simply the effect of an additional perturbation , but results from the nonlinear interaction .",
    "_ comparison with the mean - field phase diagram : _ in our paper , the mean - field approximation plays the role of a reference state used to demonstrate the differences of the local analysis . the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ phase ] distinguishes between six different regions , whereas the one in the local case , fig .",
    "[ phasepl ] ( top ) shows only three . comparing the two phase diagrams",
    ", we realize that the most interesting regions in fig .",
    "[ phase ] , namely ( c ) and ( f ) , have simply collapsed into the separatrix shown in fig .",
    "[ phasepl ] .",
    "the region ( c ) of unstable asymmetric coexistence or multiple outcome , respectively ( see sect . [ 3 ] ) , relates to the separatrix line above the voter point .",
    "it should be noticed that the phase diagram for local interaction , fig .",
    "[ phasepl ] , correctly predicts that the deterministic behavior for @xmath226 leads to complete invasion ( see sect . [",
    "4.3 ] and fig .",

    "the region ( f ) of stable asymmetric coexistence relates to the extended area of the separatrix shown below the voter point in fig .",

    "[ x - t-2 ] , [ variat ] ( top ) clearly illustrate .",
    "we conclude that in the local case no regions of stationary _ and _ asymmetric coexistence between the two species exist , as was predicted by the mean - field analysis .",
    "however , we find a ( small but extended ) region _ on _ the separatrix that shows the _ nonstationary _ and asymmetric coexistence of the two species for _ single _ realizations ( which results in a symmetric coexistence averaged over runs , @xmath251 , see fig .",
    "[ variat ] , top ) .    _ the role of positive frequency dependence : _ the possible nonlinear responses in frequency dependent processes can be distinguished in four parameter areas of positive and negative frequency dependence and positive and negative allee effects , as fig .",
    "[ region ] shows .",
    "previous investigations @xcite assigned a dynamic leading to invasion to a positive frequency dependence , while associating a spatial coexistence with negative frequency dependence .",
    "our investigations have shown that such an assignment does not unambiguously hold .",
    "in particular , a random coexistence can be found for _ negative _ frequency dependent dynamics as well as for _ positive _ frequency depencence , which was so far assigned to complete invasion only @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "complete invasion is not observed only for positive frequency dependence , but also for positive and negative allee effects .",
    "a random spatial coexistence can be found for positive and negative allee dynamics as well .",
    "the only case where just one dynamic regime can be observed is the case of negative frequency dependence .",
    "we note , however , that the nonstationary long - term coexistence with spatial pattern formation occurs both for the positive frequency dependence and the negative allee dynamics , given that the parameters are chosen from the most interesting zone of the separatrix below the voter point .    in conclusion ,",
    "the region of positive frequency dependence bears in fact a much more richer dynamics , as it is transected by the separatrix we identified in the local analysis and thus shows all three types of dynamics we could identify for nonlinear voter models , namely ( i ) complete invasion of one of the species via the formation of large domains , ( ii ) long - term coexistence of both species with random distribution , ( iii ) long - term coexistence of both species with formation of nonstationary domains . however , the most interesting regime ( iii ) is _ not _ restricted to positive frequency dependent processes , but can be also found for some negative allee effects .",
    "we summarize our findings by pointing out that _ nonlinear _ vm show indeed a very rich dynamics which was not much investigated yet .",
    "in addition to the phenomenon of complete invasion ( or consensus ) which occurs also beyond the linear vm , we find most interesting that certain parameter settings lead to a dynamics with nonstationarity and long - term correlations .",
    "thinking about possible applications of the vm , we see that in particular this region has the potential to model relevant observations , be it the temporal dominance of certain species in a habitat or the temporal prevalence of certain opions ( or political parties ) in a social system .",
    "the nonstationarity observed gives rise to the prediction that such dominance may not be the end , and change happens ( even without additional perturbation ) .",
