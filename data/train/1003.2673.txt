    "since bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of dilute gases of alkali atoms was realized in 1995  @xcite , much attention has been paid to the ultracold atomic systems in various configurations , such as optical lattices which are formed by counter - propagating laser beams . due to the flexibility of the system ,",
