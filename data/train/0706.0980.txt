    "the quantum theory of cosmological fluctuations generated during the inflationary stage of the very early universe describes the time evolution of the scalar eigenmodes @xmath0 .",
    "the physical momentum of the eigenmodes @xmath1 is red - shifted in an expanding frw universe with increasing scalar factor @xmath2 .",
    "if one takes a certain wavelength ( of cosmological fluctuations ) today and evolves it backwards in time , due to expansion this scale will shrink to smaller and smaller values and at one point will become smaller than the planckian length .",
    "in other words , there are length scales visible today that have been below planck length at some point in the past .",
    "this effect is especially dramatic during inflation , where the scalar factor increases exponentially .",
    "ultimately , at some instance the physical momentum becomes equal to the planckian mass scale @xmath3 .",
    "after this point , the quantum field theory approach to fluctuations in an expanding universe ( say , during inflation ) should be replaced by a theory incorporating quantum gravity ( say , string theory ) which is not yet available .",
    "we found the earliest written traces of the trans - planckian problem in @xcite .",
    "the trans - planckian challenge was articulated in @xcite , and discussed in many papers , see e.g @xcite .     in the milne universe .",
    "the horizontal dashed line represents the planck scale @xmath4 . a given wavelength for example @xmath5 crosses the planckian scale at its trans - planckian moment @xmath6 .",
    "]    suppose that trans - planckian effects alter the result of the conventional qft at inflation . despite an unclear notion about the microscopic theory of the effect",
    ", there is , however , a convenient phenomenological encoding for it in terms of bogolyubov coefficients @xcite .",
    "indeed , as far as the physical momentum of the mode is below @xmath3 , qft is applicable . instead of the vacuum being the positive frequency eigenmode @xmath7 , one can use the bogolyubov coefficients @xmath8 to describe the mode function of the initial state @xmath9 uv physics , if any , is encoded in the @xmath10 .",
    "the trans - planckian effect looks pretty universal for any expanding frw universe .",
    "consider the milne universe which is a hyperbolic space with frw type metric @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the scalar factor .",
    "this is the co - moving coordinate system of the kinematic milne model , which represents a medium of probe particles without gravity freely moving from the origin in empty space - time .    in this model ,",
    "physical wavelengths are red - shifted , so the reasoning for a trans - planckian effect should also be applied here , see figure  [ fig:1 ] . however , the milne universe is in fact another coordinate system of flat minkowski space - time , where qft can be treated analytically in great details , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "therefore qft in the milne universe can be used as a convenient ground to address the trans - planckian effect .",
    "we will focus on the vev of the energy - momentum tensor of a test scalar field , @xmath13 , which can be calculated in both coordinate systems of the flat space - time : in the usual minkowski coordinates , and in the milne coordinates ( [ eqn : metric : milne : real ] ) . for a given choice of vacuum the answer for",
    "the covariant energy - momentum tensor @xmath14 should be the same .",
    "however , for the calculation of @xmath13 in the milne coordinates , trans - planckian effects ( in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath10 ) can be included and can alter the result .",
    "we will consider this as a test to the trans - planckian prescription .",
    "traditionally , the trans - planckian problem is considered in the context of an expanding universe , where @xmath15 and @xmath10 are inherited from the past . however , we can also consider the trans - planckian problem for a contracting universe , where the horizon is still much bigger than planckian size while the wavelengths are already blue - shifted below the planckian scale .",
    "this takes place in the contracting phase of the milne universe ( similar to the figure  [ fig:1 ] but with reverse time direction ) . for higher",
    "momenta ( @xmath16 ) , the `` trans - planckian '' moment of time where a given wavelength crosses the planckian scale occurs at time @xmath17 sec , and where we expect qft in flat space - time to be valid .",
    "therefore we can calculate the vev of the energy - momentum tensor at the `` trans - planckian '' time in minkowski coordinates which obviously vanishes @xmath18 our goal is to calculate @xmath13 in the contracting milne universe ( [ eqn : metric : milne : real ] ) with and without trans - planckian contribution and compare it to the correct result ( [ min ] ) .",
    "the calculation of @xmath13 in the contracting milne universe is technically easier than that in the expanding milne universe ( although still quite tedious ) .",
    "therefore we first consider the problem in the contracting milne universe where methods of calculations will be introduced , and then extend the results for the expanding milne universe .",
    "we credit @xcite where @xmath19 for the spin 1/2 field in the contracting milne universe was calculated , and we will extend its method to the case of the scalar field , and the book @xcite , where @xmath13 for a scalar field in the contracting milne universe was calculated by a different method .",
    "we also consider @xmath13 in the expanding milne universe .",
    "since the time @xmath20 of the milne coordinates and @xmath21 of the minkowski coordinates are connected by non - linear transformations , the vacuum choice for the expanding milne universe is different from that in the contracting milne universe .",
    "this is related to the choice of the conformal vacuum vs. adiabatic vacuum @xcite . as a result ,",
    "@xmath13 in the minkowski coordinates for this vacuum is non - zero and corresponds to an integration over the thermal spectrum of particles seen by an accelerating observer . on the other hand in an expanding milne universe ,",
    "in addition to this vev , we may include a potential trans - planckian contribution to @xmath8 , which will alter the expected result .",
    "the plan of this note is as follows .",
    "section 2 contains a short introduction to the milne universe .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the general qft in the frw type universes , including the milne universe .",
    "section 4 gives a brief outline of the calculation of @xmath14 in contracting milne universe , while calculational details are collected in the appendix .",
    "section 5 contains the extension of the results to the expanding milne universe . in section 6",
    "we discuss the challenge to the trans - planckian challenge .",
    "the metric of the milne universe is a frw type metric ( [ eqn : metric : milne : real ] ) or written in conformal coordinates @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the conformal time . for the milne metric the curvature tensor vanishes @xmath24 , so it covers a portion of flat space - time .",
    "it is related to minkowski space - time @xmath25 by a coordinate transformation @xmath26 covering the patch @xmath27 .",
    "the upper cone @xmath28 corresponds to an expanding universe , the lower one @xmath29 corresponds to the contracting universe , see figure  [ fig : milne ] .",
    "the conformal properties of the milne universe are important for the choice of the vacuum , which is related to global time - like killing vectors .",
    "indeed , there is a useful theorem @xcite : if for two conformally related conformally flat space - times @xmath30 with @xmath31 flat there exists a diffeomorphism between a global cauchy hypersurface @xmath32 of @xmath33 and a global cauchy hypersurface @xmath34 of @xmath31 , then there exists also a correspondence between the global time - like killing vector fields of @xmath33 and @xmath31 .",
    "taking the milne universe as @xmath33 , it was found @xcite ( through mapping both space - times to the einstein universe ) that these conditions are fulfilled when taking @xmath31 to be rindler space with metric @xmath35 which possesses two global time - like killing vector fields @xmath36 corresponding to the conformal vacuum and the adiabatic vacuum .",
    "so we can deduce that there are also two global time - like killing vector fields for the milne universe , one of them defining the conformal vacuum , and the other the adiabatic vacuum .",
    "the corresponding conformal killing vector fields in the milne metric ( [ eqn : metric : milne : conf ] ) are @xmath37 where @xmath38 are now the coordinates of the metric ( [ eqn : metric : milne : conf ] ) .",
    "we are faced with the choice which vacuum to take .",
    "it turns out that natural choice of vacuum for the contracting milne universe is the adiabatic vacuum , associated with the killing vector @xmath39 .",
    "the adiabatic vacuum also corresponds to the usual vacuum in the minkowski coordinates .",
    "indeed , this killing vector @xmath39 is nothing but @xmath40 .",
    "the conformal vacuum associated with the other killing vector @xmath41 is the natural choice of vacuum for the expanding milne universe .",
    "let us recall the basics of the qft of a free massive real scalar field in a frw background .",
    "the equation of motion for the scalar field is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the mass of the scalar field and @xmath45 is the ricci scalar . using conformal time in the frw universe and making the ansatz @xmath46 where @xmath47 are eigenfunctions of the spatial laplacian @xmath48 with quantum numbers @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the measure over the quantum numbers , we obtain the following equation for the modes @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the derivative with respect to conformal time .",
    "we quantize the field @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the creation and annihilation operators for particles and antiparticles respectively . using orthogonality relations for the eigenmodes of the spatial laplacian",
    "it can be shown that the @xmath56-component of the normal ordered energy momentum tensor for a scalar field is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58    now we have to specify the vacuum @xmath59 and the eigenmodes @xmath51 .",
    "the general solution to equation ( [ eigen ] ) is @xmath60 where we defined @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 are the hankel functions .",
    "now consider the contracting milne universe .",
    "initial conditions shall be defined at @xmath64 .",
    "for @xmath65 we find a normalized positive energy solution @xmath66 the correct normalization follows from @xmath67 which translates into @xmath68 with @xmath69 being a time - like conformal killing vector field orthogonal to the 3-surface of integration @xcite .",
    "the choice ( [ eqn : hankel ] ) of the eigenmode corresponds to the adiabatic vacuum . physically , the adiabatic vacuum corresponds to a vacuum which comes closest to being minkowski , i.e. it should become minkowski in the limit of a very slowly changing geometry . in general this vacuum",
    "is associated with the wkb - type mode solutions of the equation of motion @xmath70 where @xmath71 satisfies the non - linear equation @xmath72 taking the limit of slowly varying scale factor @xmath73 or rather equivalently the limit of large @xmath20 ( or @xmath23 ) , we can approximate @xmath74 , so that the adiabatic approximation to the wkb - type solution is given by @xmath75 which corresponds to the large @xmath23 limit of the eigenmodes ( [ eqn : hankel ] ) .",
    "thus , the adiabatic vacuum @xmath76 of the contracting milne universe is the same as the minkowski vacuum @xcite .",
    "next , we consider the expanding milne universe .",
    "initial conditions shall be defined at @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "we have to select the solution @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the bessel function .",
    "its asymptotic form at @xmath81 is given by the normalized positive frequency solution @xmath82 .",
    "this choice of eigenmode corresponds to the conformal vacuum .",
    "indeed , the conformal vacuum is obtained by performing a conformal transformation of the metric @xmath83 to the metric @xmath84 , @xmath85 which changes the equation of motion ( [ eqn : eomphi ] ) to @xmath86 , where @xmath87 . the vacuum state associated with the modes @xmath88 of @xmath89 corresponds to the conformal vacuum @xmath90 .",
    "it is instructive to compare the vacua of the contracting ( adiabatic ) and expanding ( conformal ) milne universe .",
    "we can express the orthogonal set @xmath91 of normalized eigenfunctions of the expanding universe ( [ eqn : bessel ] ) in terms of the set of eigenfunctions @xmath51 of the contracting universe ( [ eqn : hankel ] ) introducing bogolyubov coefficients @xmath92 using the relation between the bessel and the hankel functions ( see ( [ conn ] ) ) we find @xmath93 in particular , this means that the conformal vacuum in minkowski space - time corresponds to excitations of states related to the usual minkowski adiabatic vacuum . in other words , in minkowski coordinates @xmath94 but @xmath95 .",
    "in this section we outline the calculation of the energy momentum tensor @xmath96 , in the contracting milne universe .",
    "the starting point is expression ( [ eq : tno ] ) where we have to substitute the solution ( [ eqn : hankel ] ) .",
    "formally the expression ( [ eq : tno ] ) for the mode functions in the milne universe is divergent and needs to be regularized .",
    "normal ordering in ( [ eq : tno ] ) takes care of the divergence coming from the zero point energy , but the energy momentum tensor in a curved space - time features more divergences which are attributed to vacuum polarization . in frw type space - times",
    "it is most convenient to use the regularization method of zeldovich and starobinsky @xcite , which we have adopted .",
    "the result is to replace @xmath97 in ( [ eq : tno ] ) by @xmath98 with ( see ( [ eq : suv ] ) in the appendix ) @xmath99\\nonumber\\\\    & & + { 1\\over64}\\left[{1\\over\\omega}{\\partial\\over\\partial\\eta}\\left({\\dot{\\omega}\\over\\omega^2}\\right)\\right]^2 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we illustrate the calculation for the energy density @xmath100 , the other components of @xmath101 can be either calculated similarly or from @xmath102 , energy conservation @xmath103 and the vanishing of the conformal anomaly @xmath104 .    for the renormalized energy density we have @xmath105 where @xmath106    the first two terms @xmath107 and @xmath108 are divergent , but after regularization they contain finite contributions .",
    "the finite part @xmath107 can be interpreted as a contribution of particles , seen by the comoving observer in contracting milne universe .",
    "terms @xmath109 are finite , and together with the finite part of @xmath108 can be interpreted as the vacuum polarization seen by the comoving observer .    in order to extract divergences in @xmath107 and @xmath108",
    ", we introduce the regularizer @xmath110 with small dimensionless parameter @xmath111 . at the end of our calculations",
    "the final answer will not be dependent on it and we can send @xmath111 to zero . this technical trick is borrowed from @xcite .",
    "the results of calculations of the integrals ( [ int ] ) detailed in the appendix are the following @xmath112    in the net result ( [ net ] ) all divergences are canceled .",
    "however , all finite parts are also canceled so that we end up with @xmath113 all other components of the energy momentum tensor are also zero .",
    "in this section we calculate the energy momentum tensor @xmath115 in the expanding milne universe . again , we use the formula ( [ eq : tno ] ) where we substitute the solution ( [ eqn : bessel ] ) .",
    "let us calculate energy density @xmath116 .",
    "we have an integral expression similar to ( [ eq : tno ] ) , but with the eigenfunctions @xmath91 instead of @xmath51 . in principle",
    ", we can apply the method of the previous section to this case , including regularizing with @xmath117 and extracting divergences .",
    "it is easier , however , to use relationship ( [ bogo ] ) between @xmath91 and @xmath51 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath118 where @xmath97 , constructed from @xmath119 , is defined in ( [ s ] ) .",
    "the residual term @xmath120 is defined in ( [ eqn : delta ] ) and is constructed from @xmath121 . before regularization all the divergences are in the first term @xmath122 .    expression ( [ ac ] ) becomes transparent for large values of @xmath20 ( or @xmath23 ) , where @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "regularizing expression ( [ ac ] ) is reduced to regularizing the first term which we performed in the previous section . using ( [ ab ] ) for @xmath125 , we have the final result @xmath126 as expected , in expanding milne universe energy density is non - zero due to the choice of the conformal vacuum .",
    "we will discuss all aspects of the uv physics which may emerge in the cosmological models , for instance , the impact of the horizon @xcite on the trans - planckian issue .    in an expanding / contracting flat universe ,",
    "a given wavelength of the oscillator s eigenmode @xmath127 is red - shifted / blue - shifted .",
    "the milne universe has hyperbolic three dimensional spatial slicing .",
    "the spatial eigenmode of this hyperbolic space is described by the function ( [ expl ] ) ( see appendix ) . for simplicity",
    "we consider the high - frequency modes with @xmath128 . in this limit",
    "the eigenmode ( [ expl ] ) is reduced to simple standing waves @xmath129 . for these modes we can use the intuitive red - shifting / blue - shifting picture .    in this section",
    "we will discuss how the results ( [ mmm ] ) , ( [ ac1 ] ) will be changed if we apply the trans - planckian prescription for the eigenmodes with the wavelengths which were or will be below the planckian scale in the contracting / expanding milne universe .    in the contracting universe a given wavelength is blue - shifted and will be shorter than the planckian scale at its `` trans - planckian '' moment @xmath6 .",
    "if trans - planckian effects work in this model , then the value @xmath130 will departure from zero .",
    "however , the moment @xmath6 is much bigger than the planckian time .",
    "the moment @xmath6 is not special for observers in the usual minkowski coordinate system , where @xmath131 remains always zero .",
    "we conclude that the trans - planckian effect does not emerge in the contracting milne universe .",
    "now , let us apply the trans - planckian prescription to the calculation of @xmath132 for the expanding universe .",
    "we simply alter the eigenmode @xmath133 at the moment @xmath134 , according to ( [ mode ] ) .",
    "then the result ( [ mmm ] ) will be changed to @xmath135 however , observers in the usual minkowski coordinate system should not see any effects of @xmath136 .",
    "no trans - planckian effects emerge in the expanding milne universe .",
    "it is clear that our consideration of the trans - planckian issue in contracting / expanding cosmologies is much more general than the simple example of the milne universe .",
    "consider , for example , the expanding anisotropic kasner universe @xmath137 with @xmath138 , so that one of the @xmath139-s is non - positive .",

    "the component of the momentum @xmath141 of the quantum modes @xmath142 associated with this third direction is blueshifting ( while the universe as a whole is expanding ) , and at some point passes the planckian scale .",
    "it is paradoxical to encounter quantum gravity effects in an expanding kasner universe !",
    "notice the special combination of parameters @xmath143 .",
    "in this case the kasener metric ( [ kasner ] ) is the product of the two - dimensional milne universe and @xmath144 and can be transformed to the minkowski space - time , and we have another example where the trans - plankian issue evaporates .",
    "the resolution of the paradox : the criterion for the uv ( string ) physics to become important is having large values of the curvature terms @xmath145 but not coordinate effects .",
    "we can compare the situation with another apparent paradox of inflation , using the `` trans - planckian '' value of the inflaton filed @xmath146 .",
    "there are no restrictions to use the large @xmath147 values , the physical restrictions are related to the energy density @xmath148 ( where the curvature is sub - planckian ) .",

    "<S> trans - planckian modifications of qft should result in a uv - dependent vev of the energy momentum tensor of a scalar field in the milne universe . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the milne universe is another coordinate systems of flat minkowski space - time , and the covariant energy momentum tensor should be the same ( but vacuum - dependent ) in different coordinates of flat space time . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly demonstrate that in conventional qft the energy momentum tensor , choosing the adiabatic vacuum , is identical to zero in minkowski coordinates , and remains zero in the contracting milne universe ( due to non - trivial cancellations of contributions from particles which appear in the accelerating frame and from vacuum polarization there ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to this , the trans - planckian modification of the energy momentum tensor is not motivated . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a similar argument for the expanding milne universe , where the energy momentum tensor in the conformal vacuum is non - zero . </S>",
    "<S> similar arguments are applicable for other cosmological models where the curvature is much lower than planckian which leads to conflicts with trans - planckian considerations . </S>"
