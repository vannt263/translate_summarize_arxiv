    "the brauer algebra is well defined in particular for positive integral @xmath9 , but the action on @xmath10 is faithful for positive integral @xmath2 if and only if @xmath11 .    in classical invariant theory one is interested in the brauer algebra _",

    "we take another view , and consider the stable properties for fixed @xmath2 and arbitrarily large @xmath4 . in such cases",
    "@xmath0 is not semisimple for @xmath2 integral .",

    "indeed much of the structure of @xmath0 can be recovered from a suitable global limit of @xmath4 by localisation ( and in this sense its structure does not depend on @xmath4 ) .",
    "this family of algebras can be introduced as follows .",
    "consider the diagram of commuting actions on @xmath10 , with @xmath13 : @xmath14   &    & \\ar[ddl ] { { \\mathbb c}}\\sigma_n \\\\ \\cup               &    &           \\cap      \\\\",

    "the bottom row consists of the diagonal action of @xmath15 permuting the standard ordered basis of @xmath16 on the left , and the partition algebra @xmath17 on the right .",
    "the partition algebra @xmath18 ( for any @xmath2 ) has a basis of partitions of two rows of @xmath4 vertices . the brauer algebra is the subalgebra with basis the subset of pair partitions , and @xmath19 is the subalgebra with basis the pair partitions such that each pair contains a vertex from each row .",
    "the brauer algebra also has a subalgebra with basis the set of pair partitions which can be represented by noncrossing lines drawn vertex - to - vertex in an interval of the plane with the rows of vertices on its boundary .",
    "this is the temperley - lieb algebra @xmath20 .",
    "all of these algebras are rather well understood over @xmath1 , with the exception of @xmath21 .",
    "all their decomposition matrices are known , and all of their blocks can be described by an appropriate geometric linkage principle . for @xmath22",
    "both data are trivial , since it is semisimple . for @xmath23",
    "each standard module has either one or two composition factors and its alcove geometry is affine @xmath24 ( affine reflections on the real line ) .",
    "for @xmath25 each standard module has either one or two composition factors and its alcove geometry is affine @xmath26 ( although locally the block structure looks like affine @xmath24 ) .    over @xmath1 ,",
    "the brauer algebra is semisimple for @xmath2 sufficiently large , and is generically semisimple @xcite .",
    "hanlon and wales studied these algebras in a series of papers @xcite and conjectured that @xmath0 is semi - simple for all non - integral choices of @xmath2 .",
    "this was proved by wenzl @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we determine the blocks of @xmath21 for @xmath2 integral .",

    "@xmath29 to each box @xmath30 in a young diagram , as shown in figure [ charge ] .",
    "we will also refer later to the usual _ content _ of boxes which , for the box @xmath30 in @xmath31-th row and @xmath32-th column is @xmath33 .",

    "_ for any integral @xmath2 and natural number @xmath45 a standard module can be constructed ( for some @xmath0 ) whose socle series length is greater than @xmath45 .",
    "this module also has a socle layer containing at least @xmath45 simples .",
    "the second result shows that the structure of standard modules can become arbitrarily complicated .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the partition and temperley - lieb algebra , and symmetric group , cases .    to prove these results we use the theory of towers of recollement developed in @xcite",
    "this approach is already closely modelled , for @xmath21 , in work of doran , wales , and hanlon @xcite ( since both papers use the methods developed in @xcite ) .",
    "this key paper of doran , wales and hanlon will be the starting point for our work , and we will generalise and refine several of their results .    the ` diagram ' algebras @xmath46 are amenable to many powerful representation theory techniques , and yet the representation theory of the brauer algebra is highly non - trivial in comparison to the others .",
    "we shall see that , in terms of degree of difficulty , the study of brauer representation theory in characteristic zero is an intermediate between the study of ` classical ' objects in characteristic zero and the _ grand theme _ of the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras , the study of @xmath22 in characteristic @xmath47 .",
    "another such intermediate class of objects are the hecke algebras of type @xmath48 at roots of unity , which are ringel dual to the generalised lie objects known as quantum groups .",
    "the brauer algebra @xmath21 in characteristic zero has , through its global limit , more lie - theory - like structure than @xmath22 in characteristic @xmath47 ( for which not even a good organisational scheme within which to address the problem is known , for small primes @xmath47 ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of the virtual algebraic lie theory discussed for the ( generalised ) blob algebras in @xcite .",
    "however in the brauer algebra case , any candidate for an alcove geometry formulation will be considerably more complicated @xcite .",
    "for these reasons we consider the further study of the brauer algebra in characteristic zero to be an important problem in representation theory .",
    "the paper begins with a section defining the various objects of interest , and a review of their basic properties in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "this is followed by a brief section describing some basic results about littlewood - richardson coefficients which will be needed in what follows . in section",
    "[ partial ] we begin the analysis of blocks by giving a necessary condition for two weights to be in the same block .",
    "this is based on an analysis of the action of certain central elements in the algebra on standard modules , and inductive arguments using frobenius reciprocity .",
    "section [ detour ] constructs homomorphisms between standard modules in certain special cases , generalising a result in @xcite .",
    "although not necessary for the main block result , this is of independent interest .",
    "the classification of blocks is completed in section [ blocksec ] .",
    "the main idea is to show that every block contains a unique minimal weight , and that there is a homomorphism from any standard labelled by a non - minimal weight to one labelled by a smaller weight .",
    "we also describe precisely which weights are minimal in their blocks .    in section [ bigmod ]",
    "we consider certain explicit choice of weights , and show inductively , via frobenius reciprocity arguments , that the corresponding standards can have arbitrarily complicated submodule structures .",
    "we conclude by outlining the modifications to our arguments required in the case @xmath27 .",
    "the structure of the brauer algebra becomes mouch more complicated when considered over an arbitrary field @xmath7 . for general @xmath7 and @xmath2 integral it is expected that this algebra still acts as a centraliser algebra , and this has been shown in a recent series of papers for the symplectic case @xcite . a necessary and sufficient condition for semisimplicity ( which holds over arbitrary fields )",
    "was given recently by rui @xcite .",
    "the study of young and permutation modules for these algebras has been started in @xcite .",
    "in this section we will consider the brauer algebra defined over a general field @xmath7 of characteristic @xmath49 , although we will later restrict attention to the case @xmath50 .",
    "after reviewing the definition of the brauer algebra , we will show that families of such algebras form towers of recollement in the sense of @xcite ( which we will see follows from various results of doran et .",
