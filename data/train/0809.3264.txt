    "one of the most promising signatures for new physics at hadron colliders are events with jets and large missing transverse energy ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "these searches are very general and cover a wide breadth of potential new theories beyond the standard model .",
    "jets + @xmath0 searches pose a significant challenge , however , because the standard model background is difficult to calculate in this purely hadronic state .",
    "the general nature of the signature motivates performing a search that only requires calculating the standard model background .",
    "the challenge , then , is to minimize the risk of missing new physics while still accounting for our limited understanding of the background .",
    "all experimental searches of jets + @xmath0 at hadron colliders have been model - dependent , attempting to be sensitive to specific models @xcite .",
    "initial studies for the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have been dominantly model - dependent @xcite . in this article , we explore how modest modifications to the existing jets and @xmath0 studies can allow them to be model - independent , broadening the reach of the experimental results in constraining theoretical models .    currently , jets plus @xmath0 searches at the tevatron are based on the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite and look for production of gluinos ( @xmath1 ) and squarks ( @xmath2 ) , the supersymmetric partners of gluons and quarks , respectively @xcite .",
    "these particles subsequently decay into the stable , lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which is frequently the bino , the supersymmetric partner of the photon .",
    "the mssm contains hundreds of parameters and it is challenging to place mass bounds in such a multi - parameter space . to make this tractable , the cmssm ( or msugra ) _ ansatz _ has been used @xcite .",
    "the cmssm requires common scalar masses ( @xmath3 ) , gaugino masses ( @xmath4 ) , and trilinear scalar soft couplings ( @xmath5 ) at the unification scale , in addition to electroweak symmetry breaking , gauge coupling unification , and r - parity conservation .",
    "the entire particle spectrum is determined by five parameters .",
    "one important consequence of this theory is that the ratio of gaugino masses is fixed at approximately @xmath6 , where @xmath7 refers to the triplet of winos @xmath8 , the supersymmetric partners of the electroweak gauge bosons . due to the number of constraints in the cmssm , the bino is the lsp throughout the range of parameter space that the tevatron has access to .",
    "furthermore , due to the renormalization group running of the squark masses , the squarks are never significantly lighter than the gluino .",
    "thus , the ratio in masses between the lightest colored particle and the lsp is essentially fixed .",
    "the cmssm is certainly not representative of all supersymmetric models ( see , for example , @xcite ) , let alone the wider class of beyond the standard model theories that jets and @xmath0 searches should have sensitivity to .",
    "verifying that a jets and @xmath0 search has sensitivity to the cmssm does not mean that the search is sensitive to a more generic mssm .",
    "existing searches for gluinos and squarks make strong assumptions about the spectrum and it is unclear what the existing limits on squark - like and gluino - like particles are . because squarks have electric charge , lep can place limits of @xmath9 on their mass @xcite ; however , gluinos do not couple to either the photon or @xmath10 and so limits from lep2 are not strong .",
    "currently , the tightest model - independent bound on color octet fermions ( such as gluinos ) comes from thrust data at aleph @xcite and opal @xcite .",
    "new colored particles should contribute at loop - level to the running of the strong coupling constant @xmath11 . to date",
    ", the theoretical uncertainties in the value of @xmath11 have decreased its sensitivity to new particle thresholds .",
    "advances in soft - collinear effective theory , however , have been used to significantly reduce the uncertainties in @xmath11 from lep data .",
    "the current bound on color octet fermions is 51.0@xmath12 at 95% confidence @xcite ; no limit can be set for scalar color octets .",
    "there is no unique leading candidate for physics beyond the standard model ; therefore , searches for new physics need to be performed in many different channels .",
    "ideally , one should perform totally model - independent searches that only employ the standard model production cross section for physics with the desired channels and the correct kinematics .",
    "the goal is to be sensitive to a large number of different models at the same time so that effort is not wasted in excluding the same parts of standard model phase space multiple times .",
    "some progress on experimental model - independent searches has been made . in an ambitious program",
    ", the cdf collaboration at the tevatron has looked at all possible new channels simultaneously ( i.e. , vista , sleuth , bumphunter ) @xcite ; however , these searches have some drawbacks over more traditional , channel - specific searches .",
    "the most important drawback is that it is difficult , in the absence of a discovery , to determine what parts of a given model s parameter space are excluded .    on the theoretical front , marmoset @xcite is a hybrid philosophy that attempts to bridge model - independent and model - dependent searches with the use of on - shell effective theories ( osets ) .",
    "osets parameterize the most experimentally relevant details of a given model ",
    "i.e. , the particle content , the masses of the particles , and the branching ratios of the decays . by using an on - shell effective theory ,",
    "it is possible to easily search through all experimentally relevant parameters quickly .",
    "the on - shell approximation is not applicable in all situations , but osets can still give a rough idea of where new physics lies .    in this article , we will explore the discovery potential of jets and missing energy channels . in previous work @xcite , we presented a simple effective field theory that can be used to set limits on the most relevant parameters for jets and missing energy searches : the masses of the particles . while this approach seems obvious , existing searches at hadron colliders ( tevatron run ii , tevatron run i , ua2 , ua1 ) are based on cmssm - parameterized supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the previous paper studied how varying the decay kinematics changed the sensitivity of the searches and pointed out regions of parameter space where sensitivity is particularly low due to kinematics .",
    "however , this gluino - bino module was still a model - dependent analysis in that it assumed pair - production of a new colored fermionic particle directly decaying to a fermionic lsp",
    ".    this paper will extend the analysis in two ways .",
    "first , we propose a completely model - independent analysis for jets and missing energy searches .",
    "this approach only requires knowledge of the standard model and places limits on differential cross sections , from which it is possible to set model - dependent limits . in the second portion of the paper ,",
    "we use this approach to extend our previous analysis of a directly decaying colored particle to contain a single - step cascade and study how this altered spectrum affects the final limits on the gluino s mass .",
    "before continuing with the main theme of the article , let us take a moment to describe the class of models that jets + @xmath0 searches are sensitive to .",
    "there are two general classes of particle spectra that will be covered by such searches , each of which has a stable neutral particle at the bottom of the spectrum .",
    "typically , the stability of these neutral particles is protected by a discrete symmetry ( e.g. , r - parity , t - parity , or kk - parity ) and , consequently , these particles are good candidates for the dark matter . in one class of models , the theory contains a new colored particle that cascade decays into the dark matter . in the other class",
    ", new electroweak gauge bosons are produced .",
    "the dark matter particle may either be produced along with the new bosons , or may be the final step in their decays .",
    "the first class can be thought of as being generally susy - like where the lightest colored particle is dominantly produced through the standard model s strong force .",
    "the lightest colored particle then cascade decays down to the stable , neutral particle at the bottom of that sector .",
    "these cascades will either be lepton - poor or lepton - rich .",
    "lepton - poor cascades occur when there is no state accessible in the cascades that have explicit lepton number ( e.g. , sleptons ) and frequently occur when the cascades are mediated by @xmath13 , @xmath10 , or higgs bosons .",
    "a simple supersymmetric example of a lepton - poor cascade decay is a theory where the scalar masses are made heavy and only gauginos and higgsinos are available in the decay chains .",
    "this occurs , for instance , in pev supersymmetry models , where the scalars are around 1000 tev and the fermions of the mssm are in the 100 gev to 1 tev range .",
    "producing the color - neutral states of such a theory is difficult at hadron machines ; consequently , the production of new particles will occur primarily through the decay of the gluino .",
    "one potential cascade decay of the gluino , which will be considered in further detail in the second half of the paper , is @xmath14 in this cascade , the @xmath15decays directly into the @xmath16and a @xmath17 boson , which subsequently decays to two jets .",
    "this single - step decay is the dominant cascade if the gaugino masses are unified at high energies ; in this case , the branching ratio of the gluino into the wino is @xmath18 .",
    "while these cascade decays are to some degree representative , the precise mass ratio of @xmath19 makes a significant difference in the searches . in the limit where @xmath20 the energy from @xmath21 and @xmath22 is small , while if @xmath23 the jets from @xmath24 and @xmath25 are soft . if @xmath26 , this cascade is forbidden .",
    "interestingly , spectra with unified gaugino masses are the most difficult to see because all four jets are fairly hard and diminish the missing energy in the event in comparison to the direct decay of the gluino , @xmath27    leptons from the decay of the @xmath28 , @xmath10 boson can be used in the analysis as well ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : leptons ] ) .",
    "however , jets + @xmath0 + lepton studies are better suited for lepton - rich cascades .",
    "the addition of leptons to the searches makes the experimental systematics easier to control and improves trigger efficiencies .",
    "not all spectra of new physics can be probed with these types of searches , though , and they are thus complimentary to the jets + @xmath0 search .",
    "other cascades may produce a greater number of jets as compared to ( [ eq : decay ] ) . in nmssm theories where there is a new singlino at the bottom of the spectrum @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to have cascade decays that start with the gluino , go to wino plus two jets , then bino plus two additional jets , and conclude with the singlino plus two more jets .",
    "the additional step in the decay process further diminishes the amount of missing energy in typical events , resulting in reduced limits on spectra .",
    "other models , such as universal extra dimensions ( ueds ) @xcite and little higgs models with t - parity @xcite also have new colored particles that subsequently cascade decay .",
    "the details of the exact spectra can alter the signal significantly as jets can become soft and missing energy is turned into visible energy .",
    "it is also possible that new electroweak gauge bosons are produced , which then cascade decay , producing jets before ending with the neutral stable particle .",
    "little higgs models with t - parity are one such example . in such models ,",
    "the new heavy bosons @xmath29 and @xmath30 are produced through s - channel processes .",
    "the @xmath29 can decay to the @xmath28 and the dark matter @xmath31 , while the @xmath30 can decay to the @xmath31 and higgs .",
    "it is also possible to produce the @xmath29 directly with the @xmath31 through an s - channel @xmath28 boson .",
    "this vertex , however , is suppressed in comparison to the other two .",
    "at the tevatron , the jets + @xmath0 channel is divided into four separate searches ( monojet , dijet , threejet , and multijet ) , with each search defined by jet cuts @xmath32 .",
    "cuts on the missing transverse energy and total visible energy is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of each jet . ]",
    "@xmath33 of each event take place during the final round of selection cuts .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath33 cuts are optimized for  representative \" points in cmssm parameter space for each of the ( inclusive ) @xmath34 searches",
    ". however , these @xmath0 and @xmath33 cuts may not be appropriate for theories other than the cmssm . indeed , considering the full range of kinematically allowed phase space means accounting for many combinations of missing and visible energy .",
    "a set of static cuts on @xmath0 and @xmath33 is overly - restrictive and excludes regions of phase space that are kinematically allowed .",
    "this is explicitly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : optimizedcuts ] , which shows the @xmath0 distribution of a dijet sample passed through two different sets of @xmath0 and @xmath33 cuts .",

    "the plot on the left shows the events that survive a @xmath35 @xmath33 cut .",
    "while the @xmath33 cut significantly reduces the background , it also destroys the signal above the @xmath0 cut of 225@xmath12 .",
    "these cuts were used in the @xmath36 dijet search ; they are optimized for a @xmath37 gluino , but are clearly not ideal for the signal point shown here .     and @xmath38 .",

    "a reduction in the production cross section alters the exclusion region in the gluino - bino mass plane ; while the overall shape of the exclusion region remains the same , its size scales with the production cross section @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to note , however , that while the inclusion of squarks reduces the exclusion region for pair - produced gluinos by decreasing the production cross section , it also provides alternate discovery channels through @xmath106 or @xmath107 production .",

    "for example , figure [ fig : fullscan ] shows that the monojet search safely excludes the case of a @xmath115 gluino and @xmath116 bino .",
    "a monophoton search ( with the cuts used in the @xmath36 analysis ) gives @xmath117 and @xmath118 for this mass point ; thus the monophoton search is roughly as sensitive but has a lower @xmath43 value .",
    "similarly , a @xmath119 gluino and @xmath120 bino is safely excluded by the monojet search , but the monophoton search only gives @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "there are several reasons why the monophoton search is not as successful as the monojet one . in the degenerate gluino region ,",
    "the possibility of getting jets with a @xmath56 above the @xmath123 threshold is significant ( even though the mass difference is @xmath124 ) because the gluinos are boosted .",
    "the monophoton search vetoes many events with such boosted decay jets .",
    "in addition , getting photon isr is much more difficult than getting qcd isr for several reasons - most importantly , because @xmath125 and because one is insensitive to the gluon - induced processes that contribute to the cross section . despite these challenges ,",
    "the significance of the monophoton search could still increase sensitivity .",
    "the monophoton does not fare significantly more poorly than the monojet one with the current set of cuts .",
    "thus , it is possible that a more optimal set of cuts may increase the effectiveness of the search , especially given that the backgrounds are better understood in this case .",
    "finally , the above estimates do not account for the photon detection rate in pgs , which may be different from that used by @xmath36 s full detector simulator , from which the background estimates were taken .      in this section",
    ", we address whether leptons from cascades can be used to augment the sensitivity of jets + @xmath0 searches . in the gluino cascade decay considered in this paper , it is possible to get leptons from the @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath10 boson decays .",
    "the @xmath126 lepton veto , however , eliminates most of these events .",
    "the exclusion limit for the gluino decay discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : cascades ] is not improved by removing the lepton veto ; most of the irreducible backgrounds ( @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) have a lepton and dominate over the signal when the veto is removed .",
    "the exclusion limit is not improved even if we require all events to have a certain number of leptons , or place cuts on lepton @xmath56 .",
    "the question still remains as to whether there is any region in parameter space where the jets + @xmath0 study places no exclusion , but a jets + @xmath0 + lepton study does .",
    "the lepton signal is useful for light gluinos ( @xmath129 ) that are nearly degenerate with the wino .",
    "the signal point , a @xmath130 gluino decaying to a @xmath131 bino through a @xmath132 wino , is not excluded by the ordinary jets + @xmath0 analysis .",
    "we find here , though , that it has a significance of @xmath133 for a @xmath56 cut of @xmath131 , but with a @xmath134 .    for high - mass gluinos , inclusion of the lepton signal",
    "does not increase the sensitivity of the search because the smaller production cross section decreases the signal significance .",
    "it might however be possible that lepton signatures are effective for high - mass gluinos in lepton - rich cascades that contain sleptons .",
    "overall , though , these results indicate that while jets + @xmath0 + lepton searches may be useful in certain regions of parameter space , they should be combined with jets + @xmath0 searches to provide optimal coverage .",
    "in this article , we discuss how model - independent bounds can be placed on the mass of the lightest color octet particle that is pair - produced at the tevatron .",
    "the main aspects of the analysis focus on the advantage of running exclusive @xmath34 searches , and placing limits using the measured differential cross section as a function of the visible and missing energy .",
    "we show that the exclusion reach can be significantly extended beyond those published by @xmath36 because the @xmath0 and @xmath33 cuts used in their analysis were only optimized for points in cmssm parameter space .",
    "the proposed analysis we present here opens up the searches to all regions of parameter - space , allowing us to set limits on all kinematically - accessible gluinos .",
    "we also show how the exclusion reach is degraded when gluino cascade decays are included , focusing on the example of an intermediate wino , which decays to the dark matter candidate .",
    "we have so far only focused on jet classification , @xmath0 , and @xmath33 as available handles for increasing the reach of jets + @xmath0 searches .",
    "however , in certain special cases , other techniques might be useful .",
    "for example , if the gluino decays dominantly to @xmath135 jets , heavy flavor tagging can be used advantageously .    in our analysis of",
    "the cascade decays , we often found that the regions of highest significance in the differential cross section plot were pressed down against the 100 gev cutoff in missing transverse energy .",
    "this lower limit was imposed to avoid regions where the qcd background dominates .",
    "if the 100 gev limit could be reduced , then it would open up regions of high statistical significance that renders sensitivity to a larger region of parameter space .",
    "the numerous uncertainties in the theory and numerical generation of qcd events make it unlikely that precision qcd background will be generated in the near future .",
    "however , it may still be possible to reduce the cutoff by using event shape variables ( i.e. , sphericity ) .    looking forward to the lhc , jets + @xmath0 searches are still promising discovery channels for new physics . the general analysis presented in this paper",
    "can be taken forward to the lhc without any significant changes .",
    "the primary modification will be to optimize the jet @xmath136 used in the classification of the @xmath137 searches .",
    "the backgrounds for the lhc are dominantly the same ; however @xmath61 will be significantly larger and the size of the qcd background will also be different .",
    "many of the existing proposals for searches at the lhc focus primarily on @xmath138 inclusive searches and are insensitive to compressed spectra ; see @xcite for further discussion on mssm - specific compressed spectra at the lhc . by having exclusive searches over @xmath139 to @xmath138",
    ", the lhc will be sensitive to most beyond the standard model spectra that have viable dark matter candidates that appear in the decays of new strongly - produced particles , regardless of the spectrum .",
    "additionally , having the differential cross section measurements will be useful in fitting models to any discoveries .",
    "finally , it is necessary to confirm that there are no gaps in coverage between the lhc and tevatron ; in particular , if there is a light ( @xmath102125 gev ) gluino , finding signal - poor control regions to measure the qcd background may be challenging .",
