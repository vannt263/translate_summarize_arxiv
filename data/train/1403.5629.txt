    "monolayer mos@xmath0 has attracted much attention due to its promising applications in electronics,@xcite optoelectronics,@xcite valleytronics@xcite and also spintronics.@xcite for the application of spintronic devices , the suitable spin lifetime and spin diffusion length are required.@xcite this indicates the importance of the investigations on the spin relaxation and spin diffusion in this material .",
    "very recently , spin relaxation has been studied in monolayer mos@xmath0.@xcite wang and wu@xcite calculated the in - plane spin relaxation time of electrons due to the dyakonov - perel@xcite ( dp ) and elliot - yafet@xcite ( ey ) mechanisms with the intra- and inter - valley processes included .",
    "they pointed out that the dp mechanism , which results from the inhomogeneous broadening@xcite together with any scattering process , dominates the spin relaxation .",
    "the inhomogeneous broadening is from the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) of the conduction band@xcite @xmath1\\hat{\\bf z } , \\label{soctime}\\ ] ] where the @xmath2-axis is perpendicular to the monolayer mos@xmath0 plane ; @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the strengths of the soc ; @xmath6 represents the k(k@xmath7 ) valley .",
    "the first term of the soc , which is momentum independent , only induces the inter - valley dp spin relaxation whereas the last two terms are momentum dependent , which lead to the intra- and inter - valley spin relaxation processes .",
    "in addition , as only the last term ( i.e. , negligible anisotropic cubic one ) causes the dp spin relaxation with the electron - impurity scattering , the electron - impurity scattering is shown to play a marginal role in the spin relaxation.@xcite    in contrast to the spin relaxation in time domain , the inhomogeneous broadening in spin diffusion for in - plane spins is determined by the spin precession frequency@xcite @xmath8\\hat{\\bf z } \\label{socspatial}\\ ] ] when the spin diffusion is along the @xmath9-axis . here ,",
    "@xmath10 stands for the effective mass . due to the existence of @xmath11 ,",
    "all three terms become momentum dependent , which can induce the intra- and inter - valley relaxations for in - plane spins along the diffusion .",
    "this is different from the case of the spin relaxation in time domain as previously mentioned .",
    "in addition , @xmath11 also makes the first two terms ( i.e. , the leading ones ) anisotropic .",
    "this suggests that the electron - impurity scattering may play an important role in the in - plane spin diffusion , which is of great difference from the case of the spin relaxation in time domain in monolayer mos@xmath0,@xcite but similar to the case of the spin diffusion in semiconductors@xcite and single - layer graphene.@xcite    as for the out - of - plane spins , the spin diffusion length is infinite since the spin precession frequency @xmath12 [ see eq .",
    "( [ socspatial ] ) ] is along the out - of - plane direction .",
    "however , this is not the case in the presence of an out - of - plane electric field .",
    "very recently , bishnoi and ghosh@xcite investigated the out - of - plane spin diffusion with this electric field applied .",
    "they showed that the out - of - plane spins relax during the spin diffusion since the out - of - plane electric field induces a rashba soc , which provides an inhomogeneous broadening in the spatial domain for out - of - plane spins.@xcite however , the rashba soc they used is incomplete according to the recent work by kormnyos _",
    "et al._.@xcite in addition , the electron - electron coulomb and electron - impurity scatterings , which have been shown to play an important role in spin diffusion in semiconductors@xcite and single - layer graphene,@xcite are absent in their work.@xcite moreover , they also overlooked the inter - valley electron - phonon scattering , which is of crucial importance in spin relaxation in time domain.@xcite it is noted that in addition to the out - of - plane electric field , an in - plane magnetic field can also lead to the out - of - plane spin relaxation along the spin diffusion.@xcite this is because the in - plane magnetic field ( * b * ) gives rise to a spin precession frequency in the spatial domain as @xmath13 , which provides an inhomogeneous broadening for out - of - plane spins during the spin diffusion .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the electron spin diffusion in monolayer mos@xmath0 in the absence of the external electric and magnetic fields . as the contribution of the spin - flip scattering due to the ey mechanism",
    "is negligible,@xcite we only take into account the spin conserving scattering . with the electron - impurity ( inter - valley electron - phonon )",
    "scattering included , the intra - valley ( inter - valley ) diffusion process for in - plane spins is studied by analytically solving the kinetic spin bloch equations ( ksbes).@xcite we find that the intra - valley process dominates the in - plane spin diffusion , which is very different from the case of the spin relaxation in time domain in monolayer mos@xmath0 where the inter - valley process can be comparable to or even more important than the intra - valley one.@xcite moreover , it is shown that the in - plane spin diffusion length decreases with the increase of the impurity density but increases with increasing electron density in both the degenerate and nondegenerate limits .",
    "very interestingly , with the electron - electron coulomb scattering further taken into account , the in - plane spin diffusion length shows an opposite electron density dependence in the nondegenerate limit compared to the one with only the electron - impurity scattering .",
