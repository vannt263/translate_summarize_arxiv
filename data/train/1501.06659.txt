    "some am cvn - type objects show dwarf nova - type outbursts and they are considered to be a result of thermal instability in the helium accretion disk @xcite .",

    "the dead time between exposures by mlf is typically 1  s. both observers used unfiltered photometry .",
    "after standard de - biasing and flat - fielding , the brightness of the object was measured by aperture photometry . by using nearby comparison and check stars ( hmb used gsc 9103.1409 for comparison and gsc 8819.1006 for check ; mlf used gsc 8819.981 for comparison and gsc 2.2 s3111120464 for check ) , the magnitudes were converted to the @xmath1 system , which approximates well the response of unfiltered ccds for outbursting dwarf novae ( @xmath40 ) .",

    "we used phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ; @xcite ) for period analysis and 1@xmath5 errors for the pdm analysis were estimated by the methods of @xcite and @xcite . for de - trending the global variations , we used locally - weighted polynomial regression ( lowess : @xcite ) .",

    "these features resemble those of the most unusual su uma - type dwarf nova rz lmi ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) but the duration of the short outbursts is extremely short compared to rz lmi . during two long outbursts ,",
    "there were short dips at bjd 2456877.7 and 2457003.52457004.5 , which were not observed in rz lmi .",

    "the intervals of long outbursts were variable between 21  d and 33  d. the durations of these outbursts were 1314  d ( s2 ) , 18  d ( s3 , including a dip ) , 910  d ( s4 ) , 11  d ( s5 ) , 9  d ( s6 ) , 14  d ( s7 ) and 13  d ( s8 , including a dip ) .",

    ". a pdm analysis of this segment of the data yielded a period of 0.01564(5 )  d with a mean amplitude of 0.13 mag . although the hump signals were weaker in the later part of the long outbursts , and the time - resolution of the observations by hmb was not high enough to depict the hump signals directly , the signal with the same period was consistently detected in four long outbursts ( figure [ fig : sn14ccpdmcomp ] ) .",

    "these variations were found to be strongest during the initial part of the long outburst ( as seen in s7 ) , which also agrees with the trend of superhumps in general . following the identification of superhumps , we call these long outbursts superoutbursts .",

    "as we have seen in section [ sec : superhump ] , asassn-14cc has all the properties of the extreme su uma - type dwarf nova rz lmi .",
    "the major difference is in the superhump period ( the superhump period in rz lmi is around 0.0594  d , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . the short superhump period in asassn-14cc",
    "can not be explained by a hydrogen - rich ordinary cv .",

    "although there remains a possibility that this object may contain some hydrogen , as in ei psc - type objects with a stripped core evolved secondary ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; ohshima et al . in preparation ) , the shortest known superhump period in this class of object ( 0.0382  d in crts j102842.9@xmath6081927 : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) is much longer than in asassn-14cc , and we consider this possibility less likely .    although this identification must be confirmed by spectroscopy , we continue the discussion on this supposed identification . since we do not know the exact orbital period , we use the superhump period ( usually different from the orbital period by @xmath21% in am cvn - type objects ) as the approximate orbital period in the following discussion .      it is known that outburst activity in am cvn - type objects is strongly dependent on orbital periods ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "objects with orbital periods shorter than @xmath220 min do not show dwarf nova - type outbursts and they are equivalent to novalike objects in hydrogen - rich systems .",
    "objects with orbital periods 2040 min generally show dwarf nova - type outbursts and objects with longer orbital periods generally do not show outbursts .",
    "very recently , two objects having orbital periods 4748 min have been found to show outbursts ( sdss j090221.35@xmath7381941.9 : @xcite ; css j045019.7@xmath6093113 : @xcite ) .",
    "this activity sequence can be naturally understood by the disk instability model and assuming that the mass - transfer in am cvn - type objects is powered by gravitational wave radiation @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting that the period ( 22.5 min ) of asassn-14cc is located on the lower border of dwarf nova - type am cvn - type objects .",
    "it implies that the object is located on the borderline between a thermally stable disk ( novalike object ) and a thermally unstable disk ( dwarf nova - type object ) and the observed behavior is in very good agreement with this expectation . among known",
    "am cvn - type objects , ptf1 j191905.19@xmath7481506.2 ( hereafter ptf1 j1919 ) shows most active dwarf nova - type outbursts [ its supercycle , which is the cycle length between superoutbursts , is 36.8(4 )  d ] and it has an orbital period of 22.4559(3 ) min @xcite .",
    "the case is more extreme in asassn-14cc showing a supercycle as short as 21  d with a much higher value of the duty cycle of the superoutburst compared to ptf1 j1919 .      in hydrogen - rich systems , it is well - known that a higher mass - transfer rate produces a shorter supercycle .",
    "there is , however , a shortest limit since the addition of the transferred matter produces a longer superoutburst ( cf .",
    "the expected limit is @xmath243  d for hydrogen - rich systems and er uma is exactly such an object ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "rz lmi , however , has a shorter supercycle of 19  d , which can not be reproduced by a simple increase of the mass - transfer rate .",
    "@xcite proposed that a larger disk radius at the end of the superoutburst can explain such a short supercycle .",
    "this radius corresponds to the strength of the tidal torque and @xcite suggested that a weaker tidal torque is responsible for the phenomenon .",
    "@xcite also explained the phenomenon in the same context .",
    "it is not known what is the expected shortest limit of a supercycle in am cvn - type dwarf novae without a modification of the disk radius at the end of the superoutburst .",
    "our observation indicates a higher value of the duty cycle ( 0.50.6 ) compared to the model of rz lmi in @xcite .",
    "the outburst light curve resembles that of a model light curve with a mass - transfer rate higher than er uma without a modification in the disk radius ( upper panel of figure 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "these findings suggest that premature quenching of superoutbursts do not occur in this system .",
    "since the mass ratios ( and hence the strength of the tidal torque ) are expected to be smaller in am cvn - type objects than in hydrogen - rich systems , the observation may suggest that a small mass ratio is not a sufficient explanation for the rz lmi phenomenon .",
    "although currently there is no parameter study for helium dwarf novae covering the highest mass - transfer rates , such a study will shed light on the interpretation of er uma / rz lmi - type phenomenon in hydrogen - rich and helium cvs",
    ".      it has been claimed in rz lmi that superhump signals were coherent between different superoutbursts @xcite .",
    "this coherence of the signals has raised important questions : ( 1 ) whether these modulations are indeed superhumps , ( 2 ) whether superhumps are continuously excited , which may be supportive evidence for the interpretation by @xcite .",
    "asassn-14cc may be a suitable object for discussing this issue , since we have observations for four consecutive superoutbursts .",
    "there was only a single viable period common to four superoutbursts ( subsection [ sec : superhump ] ) and figure [ fig : sn14ccphasecomp ] represents phase - averaged light curves of superhumps against this period .",
    "the result clearly indicates that superhumps are not coherent between different superoutbursts , and these signals can not be the orbital signal .",
    "these observations suggest that superhumps are newly excited at the onset of each superoutburst , which is in agreement with the expectation for the thermal - tidal disk instability model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
