    "although qcd is well established as the theory of strong interactions , the hadronic realm is beyond the reach of perturbative calculations . in that regime ,",
    "lattice methods are a useful tool to calculate qcd observables , but results on light meson resonances are few and usually obtained at very large quark masses compared with their physical values . very recently",
    "@xcite , an alternative technique , based on chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) and dispersion relations , has been applied to calculate the dependence of the @xmath0 ( or `` sigma '' ) and @xmath2 resonances on the averaged u and d quark mass , @xmath4 . in this",
    "talk we report our progress extending this study to include the strange quark within a unitarized su(3 ) chpt formalism @xcite .",
    "our aim is threefold : to confirm previous results within a more general formalism , to analyze the dependence on the @xmath5 of the @xmath3 and @xmath1 strange resonances and then , to study the dependence of all the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters in terms of the strange quark mass @xmath6 .",
    "for unitarization we use the well - known one - loop elastic inverse amplitude method ( iam ) that provides a remarkable description of @xmath7 and @xmath8 data up to @xmath9 gev , while generating the poles associated to the @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 resonances @xcite .",
    "this is achieved using low energy constants ( lecs ) compatible with those of standard chpt .",
    "previous descriptions come from fitting only to experiment ( see details in @xcite ) , and therefore are mostly sensitive to the lecs that govern the @xmath10 dependence of partial waves . in order to get better determinations of the lecs that carry an explicit meson mass dependence ,",
    "now we have fitted also to lattice results on @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and scattering lenghts @xcite .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : fits ] we present two new fits : `` fit i '' describes best the data , but we show also `` fit ii '' to give an idea of the typical size of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "it also makes clear that we do nt need any fine tuning of the lecs to describe the experimental and lattice results together .",
    "the @xmath5 is a parameter of chpt closely related to the pion mass that we can vary to study the corresponding change in the resonances .",
    "it is known @xcite that the iam works for goldstone bosons masses at least as high as 500 mev .",
    "since we want pions always lighter than kaons and etas in order to apply the elastic approximation , we will show results up to @xmath15 but not beyond , since then @xmath16 . in terms of quark masses , this means @xmath17 .",
    "[ [ light - vector - mesons ] ] light vector mesons + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the @xmath2 and @xmath3 vector resonances are well established @xmath18 states belonging to an su(3 ) octet . in the first two rows of fig .",
    "[ fig : mhatdependence ] , we show their dependence on the non - strange quark masses . for each resonance ,",
    "its mass and width are defined from the position of the associated pole in the second riemann sheet , through the usual breit - wigner identification @xmath19 , and its coupling to two mesons is given by the residue of the amplitude at the pole position .",
    "the results obtained for the @xmath20 resonance are very consistent with the previous su(2 ) results in @xcite ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhatdependence ] ) , and the estimations for the two first coefficients of the @xmath21 chiral expansion @xcite .. besides , the similarity of the behavior of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is evident .",
    "their masses increase smoothly as the quark mass increases , but much slower than the pion mass .",
    "this means that the thresholds grow faster than the masses of the resonances , and as a consequence there is a strong phase space suppression .",
    "in fact , the decrease of their widths agrees remarkably well with the expected reduction coming only from phase space suppression without a dynamical effect through the vector coupling to two mesons ( thin lines ) .",
    "accordingly , we see that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are remarkably constant , which is an assumption made in lattice studies of the @xmath2 width @xcite .    [",
    "[ light - scalar - mesons ] ] light scalar mesons + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the @xmath0 , or sigma , and the @xmath1 scalar mesons are still somewhat controversial .",
    "their huge width makes their experimental identification complicated and there are no present lattice calculations with realistic quark masses .",
    "it is therefore more interesting to obtain predictions on their quark mass dependence .    in the third and fourth rows of fig .",
    "[ fig : mhatdependence ] we show their dependece on the non - strange quark mass .",
    "as before , we find that for the @xmath0 the results are in good agreement with the existing su(2 ) calculation of @xcite .",
    "the most prominent feature of the scalars behavior is the appearance of two branches for the mass .",
    "the reason is that for physical values of the quark mass , the poles associated to resonances appear as conjugated poles in the second riemann sheet .",
    "as the quark mass increases these poles move closer to the real axis until they join in a single pole below threshold and then split again , now remaining in the real axis .    despite the evident qualitative similarities , the quantitative behavior of the @xmath0 and the kappa is rather different .",
    "in particular , the growth of the @xmath0 mass before the `` splitting point '' is much faster than that of the @xmath1 .    regarding their width decrease",
    ", we show that for the scalars it can not be attributed to the phase space reduction due to the increase of pion and kaon masses .",
    "related to this , we see that their coupling constants to two mesons show a strong quark mass dependence .",
    "moreover , they increase dramatically near the `` apparent splitting point '' .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     [ fig : msdependence ]",
