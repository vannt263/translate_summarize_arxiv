    "non - linear transport spectroscopy of nanoscale systems is a key technique in modern day physics .",
    "although the linear ( equilibrium ) transport regime is well - understood  @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) , the theoretical description of non - equilibrium transport , especially at low temperature , remains challenging .",
    "recent progress in this direction has led to an improved understanding of quantum transport through strongly interacting systems ( see @xcite for a recent comparative review ) .",
    "several fully numerical approaches have appeared , such as the scattering - state time - dependent numerical renormalization group ( td - nrg ) @xcite relying on the discretization parameter approximation ,  @xcite time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( td - dmrg ) ,  @xcite iterative path integrals ( ipsi ) ,  @xcite numerically exact influence functional path integrals ( infpi),@xcite quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) in combination with the nakajima - zwanzig projection technique @xcite or with an imaginary - time formalism,@xcite and diagrammatic monte carlo ( diagmc).@xcite partially analytical approaches involve the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) ,  @xcite equations of motion for green s functions ,  @xcite bethe ansatz,@xcite and the flow - equation approach .",
    "@xcite fully analytical approaches include the keldysh perturbation theory to high orders in the coulomb interaction @xmath2 ( @xcite and @xcite ) or the dual - fermion superperturbation theory.@xcite finally , perturbative renormalization group studies have mostly started from the kondo - model mapping of the anderson model , either working with keldysh - green functions  @xcite or the reduced density operator approach .",
    "@xcite    the density operator approach has a long history in various fields of physics and chemistry . in the context of nanoscale transport , it is a natural starting point for the description of systems with large interaction energies in the high temperature , weak - coupling limit , @xmath3 .",
    "it can be systematically extended to include high - order tunneling processes using the real - time diagrammatic  @xcite or nakajima - zwanzig approach  @xcite technique , in particular when combined with liouville space techniques  @xcite . however ,",
    "at low temperature this approach becomes problematic due to effect of high - energy contributions that renormalize the effective low - energy physics . in this paper , we show how this approach can be extended to this regime .",
    "in particular , we show that much of the insightful structure of generalized the master / kinetic equation approach at high temperature is preserved in this regime .",
    "we formulate a real - time renormalization group approach that naturally connects to the generalized quantum master or kinetic equation approach .    for this purpose , we study the simplest possible benchmark model of an interacting quantum dot ( qd ) coupled to metallic electrodes , the anderson model .",
    "we explicitly set up a general approach to deal with the non - linear transport at very low temperature using a renormalization group formulated in the framework of the real - time perturbation theory .",
    "we proceed analytically as far as possible , making this a technically challenging task .",
    "in fact , the problem is not really manageable without a different physical approach for dealing with superoperators .",
    "the development of this _ liouville - fock - space approach _ is a central topic of this paper .",
    "our approach differs from previous formulations  @xcite , both by its construction and by the scope of its application .",
    "the most closely related is that of prosen ,  @xcite which was used to calculate steady states of quadratic effective liouvillians . here ,",
    "we extend it to the reservoirs with continuous fields as well and further develop it to simplify the microscopic _",
    "derivation _ of effective liouvillians for non - quadratic problems .",
    "the approach introduced by schmutz  @xcite and used by other authors  @xcite differs from our approach in principal details that are essential for our application .",
    "see also the very recent  ref .  .",
    "a large part of the paper is devoted to the development of our liouville - fock space approach since it allows for general physical insights into the problem and is crucial for overcoming technical difficulties in setting up the real - time renormalization group ( rt - rg ) .",
    "we will illustrate its potential in the application to the rt - rg calculation of the non - linear transport at zero temperature . as a result",
    ", this paper by necessity is extensive .",
    "further motivation for its length is that several general physical insights into the real - time approach have not been pointed out , although this approach has been developed for some time and has found widespread use ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is therefore required that the approach is set up from scratch , paying special attention to ( i ) the causal structure and the related keldysh rotation , ( ii ) the liouville space formulation , in particular the second quantization for _ superoperators _ , ( iii ) the spin- and charge - rotation symmetries , and ( iv ) the infinite - temperature limit , which serves as a reference point , both for the second quantization technique that we develop , as well as for the perturbation theory and rt - rg . only by fully exploiting these does the application of rt - rg to the anderson model becomes feasible . clearly , these developments are best presented coherently in the context of the application to the rt - rg for which it is absolutely crucial .    to indicate the impact of these developments for our study of the anderson model",
    ", we note that the simplest approximation that includes the exact result for the @xmath4 limit requires an infinite series of diagrams in the standard real - time perturbation theory . using the rt - rg",
    ", this result is recovered only when performing a one- _ and two - loop _ analysis for the effective liouvillian _ and _ including one - loop vertex corrections .",
    "we emphasize that when applied to the interacting case , this incorporates renormalization effects from strong tunneling , while neglecting spin - fluctuation processes relevant only in the kondo regime , which enter only in a three - loop rg analysis ( the latter has been addressed previously based on a kondo - model mapping  @xcite ) . naively formulating these rg equations",
    "leads to hundreds of non - linear , coupled integro - differential equations for frequency - dependent coupling functions .",
    "the central result of this paper is the derivation of 30 coupled differential coupling functions , which systematically incorporate the leading frequency dependence and describe the @xmath4 limit exactly . on the way",
    ", we derive several exact results of general importance .",
    "altogether , this makes an efficient numerical implementation possible and allows experimentally relevant stability diagrams to be calculated from wide ranges of parameters in the non - linear zero - temperature regime ( excluding the narrow kondo regime ) .",
    "many of the results can be extended to generic models involving local interactions ( multiorbital anderson - type models ) with bilinear tunnel coupling to reservoirs .",
    "see @xcite for a recent study of non - local interactions using the rt - rg .",
    "the paper is organized in three main parts as follows . in the first part ,",
    "( [ sec : model ] ) , we formulate the model and directly revert to a liouville space description and develop the kinetic equation approach for the stationary qd density operator .",
    "we formulate the perturbation series for the effective liouvillian @xmath5 appearing in this equation using what we will call _ causal representation _ of field _ superoperators _",
    "@xmath6 with fermionic statistics .",
    "we emphasize that this formulation of the perturbation theory , although equivalent to previous formulations ,  @xcite leads to many simplifications beyond the application of interest here , and therefore warrants a proper , extensive discussion .",
    "several of these results have already found application ,  @xcite and even provide insights into , and generalization of , recent interesting predictions .",
    "@xcite moreover , a renormalized perturbation theory that takes the _ infinite - temperature limit _ as a formal reference point , suggests itself .",
    "it also connects in a natural way to the renormalization group approach while preserving much of its general perturbative structure .",
    "we show how the calculation of the current requires little additional calculation and prove that in our non - linear approach the linear current vanishes at zero bias , a fact that is not obvious from the general structure of the theory .    in the second main part of the paper , sec .",
    "( [ sec : rg ] ) , the explicit one- and two - loop rt - rg equations are derived , accounting for the energy dependence of both the liouvillian and the vertices due to the finite non - linear transport voltage . for the non - interacting case , @xmath4 , the _ current _",
    "is shown to arise naturally as an exact result already in the one - loop rt - rg , implying that all two - loop corrections _ to this observable _ arise from the strong local coulomb interaction .",
    "we find , however , that for @xmath4 non - zero , two - loop terms exist , which are relevant when one is interested in , e.g. , the density matrix ( and not just the current ) .",
    "the non - trivial frequency dependence of two - loop equations is systematically accounted for in powers of the renormalized dimensionless coupling superoperators @xmath7 , resulting in an effective rg equation _ for an effective liouvillian only _ that accounts for vertex renormalization corrections .",
    "this simplification enables the detailed numerical study of the zero - temperature , non - linear transport in the third part of the paper , sec .",
    "( [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "this covers all regimes , except for the kondo regime of low applied voltage and magnetic field .",
    "the importance of accounting for both one- and two - loop corrections , as well as the non - equilibrium matsubara axes is demonstrated numerically .",
    "finally , we show that the _ tunnel - induced _ renormalization effects incorporated in our one- plus - two - loop approach enhance the inelastic cotunneling resonance at finite magnetic field and voltage and generate non - linearities of the single - electron tunneling ( set ) stability diagrams ( coulomb diamonds ) .",
    "in this section we introduce the model and our compact notation , which is crucial to the liouville space formulation of the theory .",
    "the simplest model hamiltonian of a qd that takes into account coulomb interaction effects involves just a single orbital : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the occupation operators . here",
    ", @xmath11 denotes the energy of the orbital , experimentally controlled by the gate voltage @xmath12 ( we take @xmath13 ) , and @xmath2 is the coulomb charging energy .",
    "the index @xmath14 corresponds to spin up ( @xmath15 ) and down ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 is the @xmath18 component of the spin vector operator @xmath19 along the external magnetic field @xmath20 ( in units where @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "the dot is attached to electrodes , treated as free electron reservoirs : @xmath23 where the index of the spin @xmath14 , quantized along the @xmath18-axis , corresponds to @xmath24 , the reservoir index @xmath25 corresponds to @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the orbital index .",
    "the reservoir electron number and spin operator can be decomposed as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , into @xmath30 in the continuum limit the reservoirs are described by the density of states @xmath31 and we go to the energy representation of the fermionic operators , @xmath32 with the anticommutation relations @xmath33_{+ }    & =     \\delta_{\\sigma,\\sigma ' } \\delta_{r , r ' } \\delta ( \\omega - \\omega ' )     ,    \\\\    [ { a}_{\\sigma , r } ( \\omega ) ,   { a}_{\\sigma',r ' } ( \\omega')]_{+ } & = 0    , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we denote ( anti)commutators by @xmath34_{\\pm } = a b \\pm b a$ ] .",
    "thus we have for the reservoir hamiltonian : @xmath35 in contrast to @xmath36 the energy @xmath37 is the electron energy relative to @xmath38 , i.e. , the reference energy depends on which reservoir @xmath39 is considered .",

    "we will often omit these subscripts if only one multi - index appears .",
    "importantly , it can be shown   that operators ( and , below also superoperators ) of the dot and the reservoirs can be treated _ as if _ they _ commute _ ( rather than anticommute ) , i.e. , @xmath58_{-}=0 $ ] for all multi - indices @xmath54 , @xmath59 .",

    "( [ spectdens ] ) , the density of states varies on the energy scale of the bandwidth @xmath66 , which we assume to be much larger than any other energy scale in the problem . in this wide - band limit",
    ", we can assume @xmath67 to be energy independent and cut off all reservoir energy integrals ( @xmath37 ) at the scale @xmath66 .",
    "the detailed energy dependence of @xmath67 at high energies is not crucially important for the results .",

    "the results of this section and much of sec .",
    "( [ sec : rg ] ) , however , do _ not _ depend on these assumptions unless explicitly indicated .",
    "the purpose of this section is twofold .",
    "first , we briefly review the real - time approach to the calculation of the stationary reduced density operator , introducing the central quantities @xmath77 , the self - energy superoperator , and @xmath5 , the effective liouvillian , and their perturbative expansions in vertex superoperators @xmath6 .",
    "second , we introduce a `` causal '' representation of the perturbation theory , which allows for a compact formulation and derivation of the diagrammatic rules for the self - energy @xmath78 . moreover , many general physical insights become explicitly clear in this representation . in particular , this new formulation naturally suggests the possibility of a two - stage , real - time renormalization group ( rt - rg ) , which will be set up in sec .  ( [ sec : discrete ] ) and sec .  ( [ sec : rg ] ) .      in order to find the qd stationary state , we need to consider the evolution of the total system density operator .",
    "it evolves according to the liouville - von neumann equation , @xmath79_{- }    = -i l^{{{{{\\mathrm{tot } } } } } } \\rho^{{{{{\\mathrm{tot } } } } } } ( t )    \\label{von neumann }    , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the superoperator liouvillian @xmath80_{-}$ ] .",
    "superoperators are linear transformations of operators and throughout the paper we let the solid bullet ( @xmath81 ) indicate the operator on which a superoperator acts ( if needed ) .",
    "explicit matrix representations of superoperators are only required for the qd part and will be discussed later on in sec .",
    "( [ sec : sym_liv ] ) .",
    "the initial state of the total system at the initial time @xmath82 is assumed to be the direct product of the dot density matrix and the equilibrium density matrices ( [ grand_canon ] ) of the electrodes : @xmath83 we will discuss some properties of @xmath84 further in the following . the formal solution of eq .",

    "it is then more convenient @xcite to use the laplace transform of the dot reduced density matrix for @xmath91 : @xmath92 we will refer to @xmath18 as the dot frequency .",
    "we expand the resolvent in @xmath93 , resulting in a geometric series with terms of the form @xmath94 the average over the reservoirs can now be calculated directly using a wick theorem for field superoperators ( see eq .  ( [ wick ] ) and app .",
    "[ sec : wick ] ) .",
    "collecting irreducible contractions into the self - energy superoperator @xmath77 ( see below , sec .",
    "( [ sec : perturb ] ) ) , the perturbation series can be resummed to @xmath95 where we have introduced the _ effective dot liouvillian _ @xmath96 to keep the notation to a minimum we distinguish this quantity from the `` bare '' dot liouvillian @xmath97_{-}$ ] by simply appending the dependence on the frequency @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath5 completely determines the time - evolution of the reduced density operator .",
    "a key idea exploited both in the perturbation theory and in the renormalization group is that one is free to modify @xmath98 and @xmath77 as long as their sum remains equal to @xmath5 .",
    "the equation determining the stationary density matrix @xmath99 is now obtained by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ kineq ] ) by @xmath100 and taking @xmath101 : @xmath102 before deriving the perturbation series for @xmath77 in sec .",
    "( [ sec : perturb ] ) , we first introduce a convenient representation of the field _",
    "superoperators_.      in the following , we integrate out explicitly the reservoir degrees of freedom while keeping track of those of the qd .",
    "to facilitate this , the tunnel coupling superoperator @xmath103_{-}$ ] should be written as a convenient product of superoperators of the dot and the reservoirs : inserting eq .",
    "( [ vshort ] ) , we have @xmath104 where we defined the following `` naive '' field superoperators : @xmath105 the superscript @xmath106 keeps track of whether a field operator acts from the left or right and is referred to as the keldysh index by analogy to the green s function and functional integral techniques . in eq .",
    "( [ lvp ] ) , we implicitly sum over @xmath107 , in addition to the multi - index @xmath54 .",
    "a crucial difference to the formulation of @xcite is that we introduced a harmless additional superoperator @xmath108 into eq .",

    "however , it may seem at first sight that for @xmath111 this is not the case : when applied to a projector of states of the total system , this superoperator counts the relative parity of the fermion numbers @xmath112 and @xmath113 : @xmath114 for @xmath115 even / odd , where @xmath116 and @xmath117 denote further quantum numbers .",
    "however , in all calculations we can assume that the total - system density operators on which it acts have even parity , since odd fermion - parity components of states can neither be measured by any physical operator nor be prepared using physical evolutions .",
    "this is referred to as the _ fermion - parity superselection rule _ of quantum mechanics .  @xcite    since the fermion parity plays an important role in what follows but is often not mentioned or used explicitly in density operator approaches , it warrants some discussion , in particular since odd - fermion - parity operators do appear in the renormalization group approach .",
    "physical hamiltonians and observables ( and their corresponding superoperators ) always contain only products of even numbers of fermionic operators .",
    "this implies that only the part of the density operator @xmath118 with even fermion parity can enter into the calculation of any physical observable @xmath119 .",
    "this even part of @xmath118 is generated solely from the even parity part of @xmath120 at earlier times since by the same token the parity of the total fermion number is conserved during time evolution .",
    "therefore , only the even fermion - parity part of the initial state @xmath120 can contribute to an observable and one may set any odd - fermion part of any density matrix equal to zero . as a result , we can take in eq .",
    "( [ lvp ] ) @xmath121 , even for @xmath111 . for the factorized initial state eq .",
    "( [ initialstate ] ) that we assumed here , this implies that @xmath84 must be assumed to be of even fermion parity , since @xmath122 also has even fermion parity ( @xmath123_{- } = 0 $ ] , which follows from eq .",
    "( [ grand_canon ] ) ) .",
    "the useful implications of this fermion - parity conservation become clear when performing a linear transformation of the field superoperators with respect to their keldysh indices @xmath107 . the naively chosen field superoperators ( [ keld_j ] ) and",
    "( [ keld_g ] ) have the disadvantage that they commute or anticommute depending on the keldysh index @xmath107 : @xmath124 this complicates many calculations as noted , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
