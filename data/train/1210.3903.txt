    "the idea of modified gravity ( mg ) has been pursued as an alternative to dark energy ( de ) in explaining the observed cosmic acceleration .",
    "most of the proposed de / mg theories predict more or less the same background evolution for the universe so that distance measurement data , such as cmb and supernovae ( sne ) , can not effectively discriminate between them . on the other hand , these theories have different predictions for the evolution of structure @xcite that can be measured to a high precision by the ongoing and upcoming large - scale structure surveys @xcite .    the growth of structure can be tested in a model - independent way by parametrizing the evolution equations of the cosmological perturbations . at the linear level , it is achieved by introducing two scale- and time - dependent functions ( mg functions ) in the equations relating the scalar metric perturbations , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , to each other and to the matter perturbations @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of taking such a phenomenological approach is to detect possible deviations of perturbations from their default evolution , predicted by @xmath2cdm + gr , in an efficient and model - independent way .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the degeneracies between the parameters in these models and their impact on the parameter constraints .",
    "one can investigate the scales and redshifts where these degeneracies are minimum , how different observables can break these degeneracies , or what combinations of data do it best .",
    "this can help to come up with an optimum set of parameters for extracting information from data and constraining the mg parameters .",
    "in this paper we work with two sets of mg functions .",
    "the first set parametrizes the modified poisson equation , @xmath3 , and the ratio between the two newtonian potentials , @xmath4 @xcite . in the second case ,",
    "we use @xmath3 and also parametrize the modifications to the weak lensing ( wl ) potential by @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we consider the approximate parametric form of these functions for some of the widely used mg theories in the literature and quantify how different data sets can improve on degeneracy breaking of the parameters .",
    "we use cmb temperature and polarization data from the planck satellite @xcite , sne from an euclid - like survey @xcite and large scale structure data from a photometric wl survey such as large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst )  @xcite .",
    "we also consider pixelations of ( @xmath6 ) as a more model - independent treatment of these functions . with the pixels of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ,",
    "one is able to study the degeneracies at particular redshifts and scales of interest .",
    "there are different physical processes that lead to degenerate effects with modified gravity on the cosmological observables .",
    "for example , massive neutrinos can modify the growth of structure on their free - streaming scale .",
    "this modification can , in principle , be degenerate with the effects of mg on the overlapping scales and redshifts @xcite .",
    "we also consider the impact of some of the systematic effects expected in wl surveys .",
    "we use @xcite where three sources of systematics are modeled for future tomographic surveys : photo-@xmath9 errors , additive and multiplicative errors due to the uncertainty of the point spread function ( psf ) measurements .    in section [ formalism ]",
    ", we describe the formalism , mg models , observables and experiments we use . in section [ degeneracy ] , we study the degeneracies between the mg and other parameters of our chosen models where different parametric functional forms of the mg functions are used . from a combination of the upcoming cmb , sne , galaxy number counts ( gc ) and wl data , we show that parametrizations with small number of mg parameters can not capture a wide range of possible mg features in the data while too many parameters mainly introduces degeneracies with no extra benefit . in section [ additional ]",
    ", we investigate how the additional effects ( mass of neutrinos and wl systematics ) will change the results .",
    "the inclusion of such degenerate effects would require other complementary data to reduce the correlations between the parameters .",
    "we summarize in section [ summary ] .",
    "the line element for a linearly perturbed frw universe can be written in the newtonian gauge as @xmath10 where @xmath1 and @xmath0 are the scalar perturbations of the metric , @xmath11 the conformal time and @xmath12 the spatial coordinate .    at the level of linear perturbations , in addition to @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    ", one needs to evolve the matter density contrast @xmath13 and the velocity field perturbation @xmath14 .",
    "two equations are obtained from the conservation of energy momentum tensor @xmath15 @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the equation of state parameter for each fluid component and @xmath19 is the anisotropic stress term defined as @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the traceless component of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the other two equations required to close the system are provided by the gravity theory of the model . in the case of general relativity ( gr ) , the equations are & & k^2= - 4 g a^2 [ poisson - gr ] , + & & k^2(- ) = 12 g a^2 ( + p ) [ anisotropy - gr ] , where @xmath22 is the comoving density perturbation and the sum is over all the species present in the universe .    in the parametrized framework , [ poisson - gr ] ) and ( [ anisotropy - gr ] ) , are modified by introducing the mg functions to accommodate possible deviations from gr ( + @xmath2cdm ) & & k^2= - ( k , a ) 4 g a^2 + 3(+ p ) [ poisson ] , + & & k^2[- ( k , a ) ] = ( k , a ) 12 g a^2 ( + p ) [ anisotropy ] , where at late times the shear term , @xmath19 , is negligible and cold dark matter ( cdm ) perturbations are dominant so that the above equations are simplified .",
    "the reason for using the scalar potential @xmath1 in [ poisson ] ) , as opposed to @xmath0 , is that the growth of matter inhomogeneities is more directly related to @xmath1 . to see this note that the growth of matter on sub - horizon scales can be derived by combining [ deltadot ] ) and ( [ vdot ] ) in the limit of @xmath23 [ matter - sub - evolution ] + + k^2 = 0 , where @xmath24 and time derivative is w.r.t .",
    "conformal time .    in this approach , @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    "are generic functions that parametrize _ solutions _ in alternative gravity theories and depend on the choice of the initial conditions . in some theories , one can calculate their approximate form analytically in the quasi - static approximation .",
    "for instance , perturbation equations have been derived for some classes of scalar - tensor theories in @xcite , and for the dgp theory and its higher - dimensional extensions in  @xcite .",
    "the data considered here include cmb temperature and polarization ( t and e ) , sne observations , weak lensing ( wl ) shear of distant galaxies , galaxy number counts ( gc ) , and their cross - correlations .",
    "we assume the expected cmb data from the planck mission  @xcite of the european space agency ( esa ) using the same parameters as in @xcite .",
    "in addition , to better constrain the background expansion parameters , we include simulated sne luminosity data for a euclid - like survey @xcite .",

    "the nuisance parameter @xmath29 , is treated as an undetermined parameter in the analysis .",

    "it is expected to cover up to half of the sky and catalogue several billion galaxies out to redshift @xmath30 . for lsst",
    ", we adopt parameters from the recent review paper by the lsst @xcite .",
    "we consider observables from the above surveys and use the angular power spectra from auto - correlation and cross - correlation of these observables for our fisher analysis .",
    "the power spectra are calculated using mgcamb code @xcite where [ poisson ] ) and ( [ anisotropy ] ) are implemented . with lsst",

    "the details of the implementations are described in @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we choose to work with four models which include one , three , five and twelve mg parameters , respectively .",
    "table [ table : params ] shows the model parameters that we use in our fisher analysis and the order in which they are sorted . in all of the models , we assume spatially flat geometry and include the main cosmological parameters ( @xmath311 - 5 and @xmath32 ) . when gc data is included , we assume that the bias is scale - independent on the linear scales and introduce 10 constant bias parameters , one for each photometric redshift bin surveyed by lsst .",
    "@xmath33 is either binned or considered as a constant and is included in the fisher analysis .",
    "@xmath34 models can be tuned to reproduce any background expansion history , and the remaining relevant quantity is the squared compton wavelength of the new scalar degree of freedom @xmath35 mediating the fifth force . in units of",
    "the hubble length squared it is given by @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the background ricci scalar .",
    "thus , for a fixed background expansion history , different @xmath34 models can be parametrized by the parameter @xmath38 , which is the value of @xmath39 today .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that for @xmath40 the large scale growth in @xmath34 models can be modeled as : [ eq : par_mu2 ] ( k , a)= ( a , k)= , where @xmath41 .",
    "this one - parameter model gives a good approximation of @xmath34 theories in the quasi - static limit  @xcite .",

    "_ normalized _ correlation : @xmath66 .",
    "the reason for showing the un - normalized correlations is that it is hard to judge about the importance of correlation between two parameters by just looking at the normalized correlation values .",
    "for example , a parameter might be highly correlated with the others while being very well - constrained , which means that it is well - measured anyway . for the un - normalized case ,",

    "also we show the @xmath67 values where @xmath68 runs over all the parameters and @xmath69 is the index of the mg parameter we are plotting the correlations for .",
    "these values will be used as a reference and help us estimate the relative degree of correlations between parameters .",
    "we start from the combination of the cmb and sne ia data .",
    "we then add the gc and wl data in two steps and study how including them breaks the degeneracies .",
    "finally , we add all the cross - correlations of cmb@xmath70cg , cmb@xmath70wl and wl@xmath70cg .",
    "as mentioned , cmb+sne data are always included and mainly constrain the background parameters . for simplicity , we do not show cmb+sne and cmb+sne+wl combinations in the un - normalized plot .    with cmb+sne data",

    "this interferes with the growth of perturbations by changing the time available for perturbations to grow , which can be degenerate with changing the growth rate .",

    ", one can measure the density fluctuations of galaxies ( @xmath74 ) which is related to the total matter density fluctuations , @xmath75 , via the bias parameter _",
    "g = b   _ m  . in other words ,",
    "the potential @xmath1 is estimated from the matter density fluctuations via [ poisson ] ) up to a ( linear ) bias factor .",
    "since baryons fall into the same gravitational potential as cdm , we can write [ matter_growth - gc ] +   _ g . having @xmath76 measured by gc observations , the growth of matter perturbations is directly related to @xmath7 , bias and the hubble parameter .",
    "this demonstrates the source of large degeneracies between the mg parameters , bias and the background parameters .",
    "wl data probes the @xmath77 combination . with a similar argument as above",

    "it helps break the degeneracies ( in particular with the bias parameters ) significantly . when adding the cross - correlations of gc and wl , further information about the time evolution of the perturbations at multiple redshift bins is provided .",
    "in fact , as we will see , the cross - correlation data puts the strongest constraints on the mg parameters and breaks the degeneracies best .",
    "@xmath38 is related to the compton wavelenght of the scalar degree of freedom ( dof ) . below this transition scale",

    "varying @xmath88 will change the epochs of matter - radiation and matter - dark energy equalities , leading to a different history of growth of perturbations .",
    "the cdm density is also important for the secondary cmb effects , such as the isw effect and is an extra source of correlations between the mg parameter , @xmath38 , and @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath81 enters in both the distance measurements and the evolution equations of matter perturbations , [ matter - sub - evolution ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the mg parameters are highly degenerate with @xmath81 after including the large scale structure data . with the cross - correlation data ,",

    "the power spectrum of the primordial perturbations is related to @xmath89 and @xmath32 parameters as p_(k ) a_s k^n_s -4 , so that they determine the initial values of scalar metric perturbations , as well as the matter density perturbations .",
    "the impact of a modification to growth after recombination can , in principle , be degenerate with varying @xmath89 and @xmath32 . the main impact of the optical depth , @xmath11 ( not to be confused with conformal time ) , is on the cmb , including the isw term , which can be degenerate with evolution of the density perturbations . with the gc and wl data , this degeneracy still exists while the constraints on the parameters become tighter",
    ". we therefore see higher correlation in fig .  [",
    "fig : lsst_b0_wcdm ] ( left ) .",
    "@xmath11 is also correlated with @xmath89 so that tight constraints on @xmath89 can improve errors on @xmath11 .",
    "again , with the cross - correlation data , the time evolution of perturbations is much better constrained and the degeneracy is broken .",
    "the eos of de , @xmath18 , like other background parameters , affects the growth by changing the expansion history . the dark energy density , and consequently @xmath18 , influences the recent expansion history and determines the isw signal .",
    "however , since most of the information about @xmath18 is coming from sne ia , the main role of the large scale structure data is to break degeneracies with the mg parameters ( fig .",

    "gc data alone is neither able to constrain the bias parameters , nor it can break their degeneracies with @xmath38 . [ matter_growth - gc ] ) shows that increasing @xmath38 and decreasing the bias have the same impact on the growth of perturbations .",
    "this negative correlation , however , would vanish at high redshifts due to less observable galaxies .",
    "when wl data is added , the sensitivity to the bias parameters , specially at high redshifts , is increased . however , if we look at the uncorrelated plots , we see that the constraints on parameters are shrunk by almost two orders of magnitude . hence , the residual degeneracy , although relatively high , are not as important .",
    "the cross - correlation data is able to lower the uncertainties and the correlations by a factor of few .    while the above discussion provides insight about how our model parameters could be correlated with the mg parameters , with the 1-parameter mg model we can mainly study the theories where there is an intrinsic transition scale in the behavior of gravity due to a scalar degree of freedom with a fixed ( f(r ) ) coupling to matter . in the following subsections ,",
    "we investigate the degeneracies for models with more mg parameters .",

    "hence , the impact of @xmath49 on the linear growth is opposite to that of @xmath91 .",
    "increasing @xmath56 pushes the mg effects to more recent times ( smaller redshifts ) .",
    "data is able to discriminate between @xmath49 and @xmath56 from the measurement of the growth at multiple redshift bins but @xmath49 and @xmath91 are producing highly degenerate effects . @xmath56 and @xmath91 , on the other hand ,",

    "@xmath95 s also have a high positive correlation with @xmath56 ( @xmath3111 ) due to the same reason that explained the correlation between @xmath91 and @xmath56 in the ( @xmath90 ) model . similarly , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are also highly correlated and we did not include the correlation plots for @xmath53 .    as before",
    ", larger @xmath56 would lead to the enhancement of the growth starting at a larger redshift and accumulating over time .",
    "this mimics the effect of a stronger fifth force due to an increase of @xmath96 s .",
    "since @xmath56 is a common parameter to both the bz model of this section and the ( @xmath90 ) model of the previous section , with the same fiducial value , we can get an estimate of how much the constraints on the parameters are diluted and how much extra degeneracy is introduced . comparing the un - normalized plots for @xmath56 in figs .",
    "[ fig : lsst_csn_wcdm ] and [ fig : lsst_bz_wcdm ] confirms that both the errors and the correlations are higher by at least one order of magnitude for the bz parametrization .          in fig .",

    "the other advantage of working with the mg pixels is that one can isolate some of the physical processes that affect the growth at particular scales or redshifts .",
    "for example , we see from fig .  [",

    "this is due to the isw effect which strongly constrains the @xmath8 function at large scales @xcite which is covered by the first high - z @xmath8 pixel .",
    "one can also look at the correlations between the mg pixels and @xmath18 bins ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lsst_6 - 6 - 2-corr ] ) .",
    "there is a high correlation between the mg pixels and the high - z @xmath18 bin ( @xmath317 ) , which is positive ( negative ) for @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this is reasonable as increasing @xmath18 would change the onset of the acceleration phase to a later time and hence , more time for the growth of perturbations . on the other hand ,",
    "the low - z @xmath18 bin ( @xmath316 ) has a negligible degeneracy with the mg pixels , again , in accordance with what we expect .",
    "since most of the low - z information on @xmath18 is coming from sne ia data and , the low - z @xmath18 bins are not correlated with the mg pixels .",
    "the plots also show a general trend of negative correlations between the high - z pixels with their corresponding low - z pixels .",
    "it makes sense as any change in the high - z ( low - z ) pixel value should be counteracted with a change in the corresponding low - z ( high - z ) pixel values . as for mg parameters in the previous models , there are also high correlations between pixels and basic parameters , like @xmath81 or @xmath32 ( @xmath3120 ) , and the bias parameters .",
    "in this subsection , we take the 3-parameter ( @xmath90 ) model and generalize our analysis by including the wl systematics and considering neutrinos to be massive .",
    "we would like to know how these additional effects change the correlations between the mg and other parameters .",
    "we first include the wl systematics and , in the next step , the massive neutrinos .",
    "the systematics we consider here are the photo-@xmath9 errors and some of the errors in the measurement of the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "these errors are modeled in  @xcite and we use their parametrization for our fisher analysis ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "massive neutrinos are taken here as a part of the dark matter ( dm ) in the universe and their total mass is considered as a parameter in the fisher analysis , with a fiducial value of @xmath98 ev .",
    "[ fig : additional ] shows the correlations for @xmath49 ( top row ) , @xmath56 ( middle row ) and @xmath91 ( bottom row ) in four cases : without any additional effects , with systematics , with massive neutrinos and with both systematics and massive neutrinos . for these plots we used the full data combination .",
    "the total mass of neutrinos is considered as the last parameter ( @xmath3121 ) in the plots .",
    "systematics do not change the parameter constraints and their correlations considerably . with massive neutrinos , however , the correlations of mg parameters with each other , with the bias parameters and some of the basic parameters increases significantly .",
    "massive neutrinos , as part of the dm , would freely stream and slow down the growth on the free - streaming scales .",
    "the heavier they are , the larger portion of dm they make , leaving less cdm in the universe .",
    "this slows down the growth and , hence , massive neutrinos are negatively correlated with @xmath49 .",
    "heavier neutrinos would have a shorter free - streaming scale .",
    "this is roughly the same as the effect of increasing @xmath56 or @xmath91 , thus , explaining their positive correlation .",
    "in this paper , we studied the degeneracies between different sets of mg parameters with the other parameters that are usually considered in models of large scale structure formation .",
    "we used a combination of the cmb , sne ia and large scale structure experiments , performed a fisher analysis of the parameters and computed their correlation matrix .",
    "we considered three models with parametric forms of the mg functions .",
    "we saw in section [ degeneracy ] that in the 3-parameter mg model , degeneracies were broken to a good extent but there were relatively high correlations between the mg parameters themselves .",
    "it was also demonstrated that increasing the number of the mg parameters would introduce redundancies and weaken the constraints .",
    "finally , with pixelization of the mg functions , we were able to study the degeneracies at different scales and redshifts .    among the model parameters , the bias parameters had the highest correlation with the mg parameters , due to their direct involvement in the equation for the growth of perturbations , [ matter - sub - evolution ] ) .",
    "it seems that for the 3-parameter model , it was possible to break such degeneracies better without weakening the overall constraints on the parameters .",
    "the background parameters were degenerate with mg mainly through the expansion history and its impact on the growth time . with the gc and",
    "wl data combined , one probes two different combinations of the scalar potentials .",
    "this leads to tight constraints and relatively low degeneracies . among the observables we used ,",
    "wl provides most of the information about the growth at low redshifts .",
    "the intrinsic degeneracy between the scale and the redshift in the wl kernel limits its ability in probing the time evolution of perturbations .",
    "this leads to some residual degeneracies between the mg and the basic parameters . in such cases ,",
    "the cross - correlation of wl and gc data at multiple tomographic redshift bins will significantly break the degeneracies .",
    "in fact , the cross - correlation power spectra are the most informative observables for probing the growth of structure .",
    "we have also considered other physical effects that could be degenerate with a modification to gravity .",
    "the wl systematics that we considered in our analysis did not change the correlations while the presence of massive neutrinos could have an important impact .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate how including new type of observables , such as redshift space distortion ( rsd ) @xcite , would resolve such degeneracies .",
    "the author would like to thank levon pogosian for his guidance and useful conversations .",
    "ah also benefited from collaboration with kazuya koyama , alessandra silvestri , robert crittenden and specially , gong - bo zhao who shared his cosmofish code . this work has been supported by an nserc discovery grant and partly by world class university grant through the national research foundation , ministry of education , science and technology of korea .",
