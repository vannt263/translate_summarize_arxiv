    "in thermal systems containing massless bosons , a direct implementation of perturbation theory for the calculation of thermodynamic quantities is problematic . vanishing matsubara modes bring , then",
    ", infrared divergences that render the naive perturbative series essentially non - convergent and meaningless @xcite .",
    "therefore , the only way to proceed with a sensible perturbative calculation in this realm is to reorganize the diagrammatic series by resumming certain classes of diagrams . in particular , in the early days of the computation of the one - loop effective potential , it was immediately realized that one should resum the so - called ring diagrams even in the limit of weak coupling , and that this recipe provides a thermal mass for the bosonic ( thermal ) propagator @xcite .",
    "resummations of this sort can be performed and improved in different ways .",
    "we refer the reader to the reviews of refs . @xcite and to ref .",
    "@xcite for a longer discussion and a list of more specific references .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have proposed an alternative approach to thermal field theories , which we denoted boundary effective theory ( bet ) . in the present paper , we apply the bet formalism to compute the one - loop effective potential at finite temperature for a system of massless scalar fields with quartic interaction @xmath2 .",
    "the calculation relies on the solution of the classical equation of motion for the field , and gaussian fluctuations around it .",
    "our result is non - perturbative and differs from the standard one - loop effective potential @xcite for field values larger than @xmath1 .",
    "the boundary effective theory ( bet ) is a natural way to organize the calculation of the partition function of a quantum system at finite temperature , where one slices the functional space of @xmath3-periodic fields into sectors where the boundary value of the field is fixed @xcite .",
    "more precisely , this amounts to writing the partition function @xmath4 as @xmath5\\;\\rho_\\beta[\\phi_0(\\x),\\phi_0(\\x)]\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the field at the boundaries of the imaginary time interval , and @xmath7 $ ] is the functional density matrix diagonal element , given by the functional integration over all the fields @xmath8 that have this particular value at the time boundary , @xmath9 \\equiv   \\int\\limits_{\\phi(0,\\x)=\\phi(\\beta,\\x)=\\phi_0(\\x)}[d\\phi(\\tau,\\x)]\\ ; \\;\\;\\;\\ ; e^{-s_{_e}[\\phi]}\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath10 $ ] is the euclidean classical action .",
    "the functional density matrix diagonal element @xmath7 $ ] is an expression involving only the static boundary field @xmath6 , which already contains all the temperature dependence .",
    "thus , correlations calculated within this reduced theory encode all information about the thermal distribution of the fields @xmath6 .",
    "one can define a dimensionally - reduced action @xmath11 $ ] through @xmath12 = e^{-s_d[\\phi_0(\\x)]}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the reduced theory also contains the relevant infrared physics .",
    "indeed , the double integral structure of the partition function naturally separates the static modes @xmath6 . as a consequence ,",
    "the reduced theory amounts to a resummation of an infinite class of diagrams of naive perturbation theory .",
    "this was verified in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effective action obtained in @xcite was used to compute the pressure to lowest order in the bet formalism .",
    "the resummation of ring - like diagrams emerges directly from the theory , and the corresponding pressure is in good agreement with recent calculations using weak - coupling and screening perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "one should notice that bet is not a particular case of a procedure known in the literature as dimensional reduction ( dr ) ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "dr methods produce effective theories for the zero matsubara mode and , as such , are high - temperature approximations in character .",
    "the procedure that we utilize ( bet ) yields an _ alternative _ dimensionally - reduced effective theory for the physical field @xmath6 , and it is essentially different from dr .",
    "the aforementioned calculations using the bet formalism are non - perturbative , the results being expressed in terms of the classical solutions @xmath13 of the euler - lagrange equation .",
    "when these classical solutions are computed exactly , instead of being expanded perturbatively , they automatically resum the infinite series of tree diagrams in the strong field regime .",
    "note that the euler - lagrange equations must be solved with non - trivial boundary conditions at the endpoints of the imaginary time interval : @xmath14 must be equal to @xmath6 at the time boundary . to emphasize this functional dependence , we will denote the classical solution by @xmath15 $ ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the effective action for the fields @xmath6 admits a simple expression in terms of the classical solution @xmath15 $ ] . in order to extract the explicit dependence on @xmath6",
    ", one must solve the euler - lagrange equation for arbitrary boundary conditions , which is not a feasible task in an interacting theory ( but can , in principle , be done numerically ) .    in this paper , we solve the full classical equation with constant boundary conditions @xmath16 , allowing for the calculation of the one - loop effective potential of the theory .",
    "the complicated non - linear dependence of @xmath13 on the boundary field @xmath17 leads to a non - perturbative result that should be a good approximation even at large @xmath17 .",
    "finally , it should be clear that the use of the word boundary has no relation to other uses , often in a topological sense , such as in holographic gauge - gravity duality , etc .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : vfromjhep ] , we revisit the usual prescription to obtain the effective action and the effective potential in the functional integral formalism ; using the results of ref .",

    "our result is first compared to the classical potential itself , @xmath79 .",

    "the standard one - loop result and bet are in good agreement , since both incorporate the effect of the thermal mass @xmath80 . however , for larger values of the field , differences appear .",
    "in fact , the one - loop result has an asymptotic behavior close to @xmath81 ( the one - loop correction becomes very small at large field , and one simply recovers the classical potential ) , while the bet result approaches @xmath82 .",
    "one can see that this result is in fact dictated by the behavior of the classical solution @xmath48 $ ] : when the boundary field @xmath83 is large , the non - linear term in the classical euler - lagrange equation is very important , and the solution @xmath13 becomes a strongly non - linear function of the boundary field value @xmath17 .",
    "this non - linearity alters significantly the behavior of the bet effective potential at large @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , one can see that in this regime the bet effective potential is well approximated by the classical action evaluated at the solution @xmath13 .",
    "this suggests that for large fields , the main effect comes from the infinite sum of the non - linear tree level contributions .",
    "the boundary effective theory ( bet ) framework provides a way to control the infrared divergences of thermal field theory in a well - defined and relatively simple way @xcite .",
    "previously , we had computed the pressure of a massless hot scalar @xmath84 theory @xcite , obtaining excellent agreement with up - to - date results from weak - coupling and screening perturbation theory @xcite . in this paper , we have applied this method to the computation of the one - loop effective potential , following our previous work on the semiclassical thermodynamics of scalar fields @xcite .",
    "the effective potential obtained within the bet formalism perfectly reproduces the standard one - loop result @xcite for small fields , as expected , since the bet effective action contains very naturally the effect of the thermal mass . for large fields",
    ", bet goes beyond by incorporating the nonlinear corrections that become more and more important and are not captured by the standard one - loop calculation .",
    "we have also shown that our results are very stable with respect to variations of the renormalization scale , signaling a good behavior of the ( semiclassical ) series .",
    "a natural , and very useful , extension of this work would be treating the case of thermal symmetry restoration in the case of a double - well classical potential for the scalar field , with its consequences for spontaneous symmetry breaking and the description of phase transitions . however , this is not a straightforward extension , since the case of multiple wells presents nontrivial features related to the appearance of caustics and complex trajectories in the calculation of the semiclassical density matrix ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the nonlinear corrections captured by the bet approach can be of great relevance in the description of phase transitions .",
