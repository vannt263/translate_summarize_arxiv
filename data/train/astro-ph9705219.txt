    "slow - roll inflation provides a unified and testable paradigm for understanding the flatness and smoothness of the universe and the origin of structure .",
    "the predictions of a flat universe @xcite and a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of primordial density perturbations ( scalar metric perturbations ) @xcite will be tested with unprecedented precision by forthcoming cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature maps @xcite from experiments such as map @xcite and the planck surveyor @xcite .",
    "inflation also predicts a nearly scale - invariant stochastic gravitational - wave background ( tensor metric perturbations ) @xcite .",
    "a flat universe with nearly scale - invariant adiabatic scalar and tensor perturbations would certainly suggest that inflation occurred but would not provide incontrovertible evidence .",
    "however , specific relations between the `` inflationary observables , '' the amplitudes and spectral indices of the scalar and tensor power spectra , are unique predictions of inflation @xcite .",
    "verification of these relations would provide a `` smoking - gun '' signature of inflation .",
    "for this reason , detection of the gravitational - wave background is of the utmost importance for an unambiguous test of inflation .",
    "scalar and tensor metric perturbations both contribute to temperature and polarization fluctuations in the cmb . a temperature map , even if ideal , will never determine the tensor amplitude with a standard error better than around 30% of the total perturbation amplitude : cosmic variance from the dominant scalar perturbations provides a fundamental limit to the sensitivity of cmb temperature maps to tensor perturbations .",
    "however , the scalar and tensor contributions to cmb polarization can be geometrically decomposed in a model - independent fashion , so one can circumvent the cosmic - variance limit present in temperature maps @xcite .",
    "the polarization tensor @xmath4 on the celestial sphere can be decomposed into its `` gradient '' ( or `` curl - free '' ) and `` curl '' parts , in analogy to the decomposition of a vector field .",
    "scalar perturbations have no handedness , so they can not give rise to a curl component .",
    "on the other hand , tensor perturbations _ do _ have a handedness , so they induce a curl component .",
    "the cross - correlation between temperature and polarization can also help isolate the tensor contribution , although this signature may have some model dependence @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we assess the detectability of inflationary tensor modes given a full - sky polarization and/or temperature map with a given angular resolution and level of instrumental noise .",
    "in other words , for what tensor amplitudes can one hope to make an unambiguous statistically significant detection of tensor modes with a given experiment ? we answer this question in two ways : first , we determine the minimum tensor amplitude which would be observationally accessible with only the curl component in the polarization field .",
    "this will provide a conservative , yet model - independent , estimate for the sensitivity .",
    "we then consider the tensor amplitude which would be detectable by fitting all the temperature and polarization auto- and cross - correlation functions to inflationary predictions .    for experiments with detector sensitivities near @xmath5k  @xmath1 , the tensor - mode detectability with a polarization map can improve on that from a temperature map alone by an order of magnitude . even with detectors substantially less sensitive",
    ", polarization can provide large improvements in tensor detectability for cases where the temperature map is not very restrictive , as when fitting many cosmological parameters to a single data set . in this case",
    ", the temperature - polarization cross - correlation , which has a larger amplitude than the curl polarization component , becomes important .",
    "detector sensitivities attainable in the foreseeable future  say @xmath2k  @xmath1will dramatically enhance our ability to see tensor perturbations ; tensor - scalar ratios as small as @xmath6 might be probed .",
    "even a small amount of reionization significantly improves the detectability of tensor modes .",
    "below , we begin with a review of the inflationary observables in section ii .",
    "section iii reviews the gradient / curl decomposition and the temperature - polarization power spectra . in section iv , we calculate the model - independent tensor sensitivity achievable with measurements of only the curl component of the polarization .",
    "we then consider what can be learned from only a temperature map and from a combined temperature - polarization map .",
    "section v compares these sensitivities with the predictions of some specific inflationary models , and some concluding remarks follow in section vi .",
    "inflation occurs when some scalar field @xmath7 ( the `` inflaton '' ) is displaced from the minimum of its potential @xmath8 such that the energy density of the universe is dominated by the field s potential energy for a time long compared with the hubble time . during this inflationary phase ,",
    "the expansion of the universe accelerates , small quantum fluctuations in @xmath7 produce classical scalar perturbations , and quantum fluctuations in the spacetime metric produce gravitational waves . if the inflaton potential @xmath8 is given in units of @xmath9 , and the inflaton @xmath7 is in units of @xmath10 , then the scalar and tensor spectral indices are @xmath11 the amplitudes can be fixed by their contribution to @xmath12 , the quadrupole moment of the cmb temperature , @xmath13 ,            \\nonumber\\\\       { \\cal t } & \\equiv & 6\\ , c_2^{{\\rm tt},{\\rm tensor}}= 9.2 \\,v . \\label{amplitudes}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the slow - roll conditions to be satisfied , we must have @xmath14 which guarantee that inflation lasts long enough to make the universe flat and to solve the horizon problem .",
    "when combined with cobe results , current degree - scale anisotropy and large - scale structure observations suggest that @xmath15 is less than order unity in inflationary models , which restricts @xmath16 .",
    "if the consistency relation @xmath17 [ implied by eqs . ( [ spectralindices ] ) and ( [ amplitudes ] ) ] holds , the tensor spectrum must be nearly scale invariant ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "a temperature map @xmath19 of the sky can be expanded in spherical harmonics , @xmath20 where the mode amplitudes are given by @xmath21 this follows from the orthonormality of the spherical harmonics .    the stokes parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are measured with respect to the polar @xmath26 and azimuthal @xmath27 axes ) which specify the linear polarization in direction @xmath28 are components of a @xmath29 symmetric trace - free ( stf ) tensor , @xmath30 where the subscripts @xmath31 are tensor indices .",
    "just as the temperature is expanded in terms of spherical harmonics , the polarization tensor can be expanded , @xcite @xmath32 , \\label{pexpansion}\\ ] ] in terms of the tensor spherical harmonics @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which are a complete basis for the `` gradient '' ( i.e. , curl - free ) and `` curl '' components of the tensor field , respectively . ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an alternative but equivalent formalism . )",
    "the mode amplitudes are given by @xmath35 which can be derived from the orthonormality properties , @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the cosmological mean cmb temperature and we are assuming @xmath24 and @xmath25 are measured in brightness temperature units rather than flux units .",
    "scalar perturbations have no handedness .",
    "therefore , they can produce no curl , so @xmath38 for scalar modes . on the other hand tensor modes _ do _ have a handedness , so they produce a non - zero curl , @xmath39 .",

    "note that the panel for @xmath48 contains no dotted curve since scalar perturbations produce no c polarization component .",
    "the dashed curve in the cc panel shows the tensor spectrum for a reionized model with optical depth @xmath56 to the surface of last scatter .",
    "we use the code cmbfast @xcite to generate all power spectra used in this paper ( but note that the normalizations of the polarization @xmath57 s from this code are different than those used in this paper @xcite ) .",
    "theory predicts the covariances @xmath58 of the distributions for the multipole coefficients @xmath40 . for a given @xmath59 ,",
    "only @xmath60 independent harmonics @xmath61 are available to estimate these variances , giving a statistical `` cosmic variance '' limit to how well we can estimate each moment @xmath58 from a map .",
    "instrumental noise , beam size , and sky coverage also contribute to the variance in each moment .",
    "if @xmath62 is an estimator for the moment @xmath63 , then the ( @xmath64 ) covariance matrix for these estimators is @xmath65 for a , b@xmath66 .",
    "expressions for the entries of this matrix for an idealized mapping experiment with a given instrumental noise , beamwidth , and fraction of sky covered are presented in section iii of ref .",
    "the curl component of polarization , @xmath48 , provides a model - independent probe of tensor perturbations in inflationary models . what detector sensitivity is required to distinguish this signal from a null result ?",
    "the answer to this question will of course depend on the angular spectrum of the curl component , or equivalently , the @xmath59 dependence of @xmath48 .",
    "however , as noted above , current measurements indicate that @xmath67 must be close to zero if the inflationary relation @xmath68 is satisfied .",
    "therefore , in the following analysis we consider a scale - invariant ( @xmath69 ) tensor perturbation spectrum .",
    "furthermore , variations in the other cosmological parameters have a relatively weak effect on the spectrum of the curl component ( except for reionization , the effect of which is mentioned below ) , and it is likely these parameters will be fairly well determined by temperature maps and other observations .",
    "consider a mapping experiment which measures the temperature and polarization on the entire sky with beamwidth @xmath70 and a temperature sensitivity @xmath71 ( which has units @xmath72k  @xmath1 ) , giving @xmath73 independent pixels on the sky .",

    "if the universe has no tensor perturbations , then the @xmath75 upper limit to the tensor amplitude in a null experiment is @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the pixel - noise variance with which @xmath48 can be determined ( there is no cosmic variance if there is no cosmological signal ) . here",

    "( [ simplest ] ) with @xmath85 gives @xmath86 thus , the curl component of a full - sky polarization map is sensitive to inflaton potentials @xmath87 @xmath88 .",
    "tensor modes produce polarization primarily on angular scales greater than a degree ; the result in eq .",
    "( [ ccresult ] ) will be similar for any @xmath89 .",
    "improvement on current constraints with only the curl polarization component requires a detector sensitivity @xmath90k@xmath3 .",
    "again , the curl component of polarization is due only to tensor perturbations and its shape is insensitive to the baryon density and hubble constant .",
    "even a small amount of reionization will significantly increase the polarization signal at low @xmath59 , as shown in the cc panel of fig .",
    "1 , making the above result sensitive to the ionization history of the universe . for example , in the same model with an optical depth to last scattering of @xmath56 , the numerical factor in eq .",
    "( [ ccresult ] ) becomes @xmath91 , increasing sensitivity to the tensor modes by more than a factor of 5 .",
    "this level of reionization ( if not more ) is expected in cold dark matter models @xcite , so eq .  ( [ ccresult ] ) , for no reionization , provides a conservative estimate .",

    "however , the tt , tg , and gg power spectra also have a strong dependence on other cosmological parameters .",
    "furthermore , some parameters , such as the scalar - mode normalization and power - law index , can only be determined with any precision from the cmb .",
    "multiple parameters can be accounted for with the curvature matrix ( also known as the fisher information matrix ) @xmath94_{\\rm xx ' } { \\partial c_l^{{\\rm       x}'}({\\bf s_0 } ) \\over        \\partial s_j } + p_{ij } , \\label{fullvariance}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 are the parameters of the putative underlying cosmological model .",
    "the matrix @xmath96 takes into account gaussian priors for these parameters @xmath97 @xcite ; it is the inverse of the covariance matrix for the parameters determined from other measurements or observations .",
    "the covariance matrix is the inverse of the curvature matrix , @xmath98^{-1}$ ] , and the standard error in the tensor amplitude , after marginalizing over all other undetermined parameters , is @xmath99 .",
    "inclusion of the prior matrix @xmath96 guarantees that the other undetermined parameters will be marginalized over only for reasonable values of those parameters .",
    "if it is not included , the results for @xmath76 are overly conservative .",

    "( [ fullvariance ] ) with respect to all the parameters except @xmath83 are zero . in this case , the cc contribution to the variance decouples from the rest of the power spectra and has no dependence on the other cosmological parameters .",
    "however , even in this case , the other three power spectra depend on all the cosmological parameters , so the full curvature matrix must be calculated when comparing to the complete set of temperature and polarization data .",

    "the parameters of the putative underlying model are those used in fig .  1 , and we again consider the sensitivity to a tensor spectrum with @xmath69 . in both figures ,",
    "the solid curve shows the results which would be obtained by fitting all four sets of temperature and polarization moments ; the dotted line shows results which would be obtained by fitting only the temperature moments , while the dashed line shows those obtained by fitting only the cc polarization .    in figure [ resultssimple ]",
    ", we make the optimistic assumption that all cosmological parameters except the scalar normalization @xmath103 and spectral index @xmath104 are known .",

    "the tensor - mode detectability with a three - parameter fit comes primarily from the temperature map , although polarization does provides some incremental improvement .",
    "however , for detector sensitivities @xmath114k@xmath1 , the sensitivity to tensor modes comes almost entirely from the polarization .",
    "for the eight - parameter fit ( which is probably closer to the types of fits which will be done with satellite data ) , the determination of the tensor amplitude is always dominated by polarization , although in this case the temperature - polarization cross - correlation gives most of the contribution at larger values of @xmath71 .",
    "note that the solid curves ( from fitting to the complete temperature and polarization power spectra ) in figs .",
    "[ resultssimple ] and [ resultscomplicated ] asymptote to the dotted curves ( from fitting only to the cc spectrum ) at smaller @xmath71 .",
    "this indicates that for better detector sensitivities , the determination of the tensor amplitude comes primarily from the curl component of the polarization and thus is largely independent of the other cosmological parameters .",
    "any beam size below about a degree will be small enough to detect virtually all of the cc signal .",
    "beams smaller than this will only improve the sensitivity to tensor modes by better constraining the other cosmological parameters from the tt and tg spectra .    in reionized models , the dashed cc curves in figs .  2 and 3 move down substantially ,",
    "while the dotted temperature curves remain essentially unchanged . as mentioned above , an optical depth of @xmath56 gives a factor of 5 improvement in detectability from the cc power spectrum , bringing @xmath115 below @xmath6 for the foreseeable detector sensitivity of @xmath2k@xmath1 .",
    "figures [ resultssimple ] and [ resultscomplicated ] , for no reionization , are conservative estimates of tensor mode detectability .    with traditional bolometer detectors ( e.g. , the high - frequency channels on planck ) ,",
    "the polarization is determined by placing a polarizing filter in front of the detector , thereby halving the number of photons available for the temperature measurement . in this case , a temperature - only map with a given detector sensitivity @xmath71 should be compared with a polarized map of sensitivity @xmath116 .",
    "doing so , it is clear that for any detector sensitivity @xmath117k@xmath3 ( well above the sensitivity of the planck high - frequency channels ) , the sensitivity to a tensor signal is improved significantly with the inclusion of polarization , even after taking into account the degradation of the temperature signal .",
    "note that for planck , an rms pixel noise of @xmath118 with angular resolution of @xmath119 @xcite gives @xmath120k@xmath1 .",
    "if the high - frequency channels are polarized , this number becomes @xmath121k@xmath1 after including the extra factor of @xmath122 .",
    "it is quite plausible that the amplitude of an inflationary stochastic gravity - wave background is large enough to be seen with a next - generation experiment .",
    "slow - roll inflation provides a beautiful and economical explanation of isotropy , flatness , and the origin of density perturbations .",
    "however , we do not know the details of the physics responsible for inflation .",
    "some models predict a sizeable tensor amplitude , while in others it is hopelessly small .",
    "unfortunately , no consensus exists among theorists as to which are most likely . to illustrate the state of theoretical expectations for the amplitude of tensor modes , this section give a brief overview of some inflationary models . rather than survey the plethora of specific models individually ,",
    "we follow the classification of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we also suggest ref .",
    "@xcite for an intriguing parallel discussion .    in a large - field polynomial potential ( e.g. , chaotic inflation @xcite ) , @xmath123 with @xmath124 ,",
    "the expected tensor amplitude is @xmath125",
    ". this tensor amplitude will be detectable through the curl polarization component alone with a sensitivity @xmath126k  @xmath1 for @xmath127 , for example .",
    "therefore , the tensor modes should be accessible with planck if this is the correct model for inflation .    in small - field polynomial potentials ,",
    "@xmath128 $ ] with @xmath129 and @xmath130 ,",
    "the tensor spectrum is unobservably small .",
    "this is the type of potential expected if inflation occurs from a spontaneous - symmetry - breaking transition such as those envisioned in new inflation @xcite .",
    "similarly , in small - field quadratic potentials , @xmath131 $ ] with @xmath132 , the tensor amplitude is unobservably small .",
    "such a potential arises , e.g. , in `` natural inflation '' models @xcite .    in a linear potential , @xmath133 ,",
    "the tensor amplitude is proportional to the deviation of the scalar amplitude from unity ; i.e. , @xmath134 . to detect such a signal through the curl polarization component alone",
    "requires a sensitivity @xmath135k  @xmath136^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "a similar situation arises in exponential models , @xmath137 with @xmath138 .",
    "however , the constant of proportionality differs slightly .",
    "these models require a sensitivity @xmath139k  @xmath140^{1/2}$ ] to detect the tensors with only the curl polarization component . therefore ,",
    "if the scalar tensor index deviates by @xmath141which is consistent , although not necessarily indicated , by cobe  this tensor signal can be detected with planck .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath104 is in fact very close to unity , the tensor signal might turn out to be unobservably small . in hybrid inflation models ( those which require two fields for inflation ) , @xmath142 $ ] with @xmath143 and @xmath144 @xcite , the tensor amplitude is only constrained to be smaller than that in exponential models , so a tensor signal may be observable in such models .    to summarize , some reasonable inflationary models give a tensor perturbation signal within reach of next - generation polarization experiments , whereas in many others the signal will be elusive .",
    "as this brief survey illustrates , cmb polarization can help discriminate between models .",
    "detection of tensor modes would dramatically narrow the available range of models and determine the energy scale of inflation , while a null result would also provide interesting constraints on models .",
    "detection of a stochastic gravity - wave background is essential to test the full predictions of slow - roll inflation .",
    "here we have evaluated the detectability of tensor metric perturbations with a polarization map of the cmb .",
    "inclusion of polarization will always improve on the tensor - mode sensitivity achievable with only a temperature map . for detector sensitivities @xmath145k  @xmath1 ,",
    "the improvement is incremental and comes primarily from the temperature - polarization cross - correlation ; for @xmath146k  @xmath1 , the improvement is dramatic and tensor - mode detectability is dominated by the polarization , particularly the curl ( cc ) component of the polarization . for detector sensitivities of @xmath147k  @xmath1",
    "the improvement is by two to three orders of magnitude .",
    "polarization will significantly enhance the sensitivity to tensor modes for the high - frequency channels on planck , even though the temperature measurement must be degraded to accommodate polarization .",
    "the tensor signature in the tt , tg , and gg spectra is somewhat model dependent , but the cc spectrum , which dominates the tensor signal with better detector sensitivities , provides an unambiguous model - independent probe of the stochastic gravity - wave background .",
    "the ability of a temperature map to detect tensor perturbations is limited by cosmic variance to around 30% of the total perturbation amplitude .",
    "some prior work @xcite concluded that cosmic variance would also limit the sensitivity of a polarization map to tensor modes .",
    "however , these papers did not take into account the geometric decomposition of scalar and tensor modes which is possible with a polarization map .",
    "since scalar perturbations make no contribution to the cc polarization spectrum , the cosmic - variance limitations are effectively circumvented .",
    "the detectability of tensor modes with terrestrial and space - based gravitational - wave detectors was addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , although we believe that cmb polarization provides a more promising avenue toward detection of the predominantly longer - wavelength inflationary gravitational radiation .",
    "we have also reviewed some inflationary models .",
    "predictions for the tensor amplitude differ greatly among plausible models ; a high - sensitivity polarization map will help discriminate between inflationary models . in the event of a positive detection",
    ", the relations between the inflationary observables can be tested : the relation @xmath148 @xcite must be satisfied .",
    "several authors have previously investigated how precisely the inflationary observables can be determined with a temperature map alone @xcite and with a temperature - polarization map @xcite for some assumed ( perhaps optimistic ) models in which the amplitude of the tensor signal is large enough to be detected .",
    "while cosmic variance from scalar modes essentially precludes a temperature map from determining @xmath67 , the cc polarization spectrum isolates the gravitational waves and thereby allows determination of @xmath67 .",
    "for example , with @xmath149 and a detector sensitivity of a few @xmath72k@xmath1 , @xmath67 may be determined with a standard error of 0.05 or better by a one - year mapping experiment .",
    "we note briefly that polarization measurements at very high sensitivities will require projecting out contributions from foreground polarized emission .",
    "while the characteristics and amplitudes of polarization foregrounds are unknown at present , the valuable cosmological signals contained in cmb polarization warrant intensive study of this question .",
    "cmb polarization may be used to address a number of cosmological issues aside from tensor perturbations .",
    "polarization of order 510% of the temperature anisotropy is predicted in any model in which the cmb has a cosmological origin @xcite .",
    "the absence of polarization or a polarization greatly in excess of that expected would force serious reconsideration of current cosmological models at the most fundamental level .",
    "polarization can disentangle the peculiar - velocity contributions to the anisotropy on smaller angular scales @xcite ; only with a combined temperature - polarization map can a unique and unambiguous reconstruction of primordial density perturbations be made .",
    "polarization can provide incontrovertible evidence for acoustic oscillations in the early universe @xcite , help distinguish between competing cosmological models @xcite , constrain the ionization history of the universe @xcite , probe cosmological magnetic fields @xcite , and improve cosmological - parameter determination @xcite .",
    "the polarization of the cmb toward clusters can potentially be used to access other cmb surfaces of last scatter @xcite or to learn about cluster physics @xcite .",
    "detection techniques and study of polarization foregrounds are in their infancy when compared with temperature anisotropies . however , we hope that the arguments presented here illustrate the fundamental importance of cmb polarization for physics and cosmology and motivate experimental developments in this direction .",
