    "electromagnetically induced two - nucleon knockout has long been devised as the most direct tool for exploring the properties of nucleon pairs within nuclei , their interaction at short distance and therefore short - range correlations ( src )  @xcite . in order to extract this information ,",
    "a reliable theoretical model is needed , able to keep reasonably under control the reactions processes and the various ingredients , as well as a combined experimental study of different reactions in different situations , where the various contributions play a different role and can thus be disentangled and separately investigated .",
    "two nucleons can be naturally ejected by two - body currents , which effectively take into account the influence of subnuclear degrees of freedom like mesons and isobars . direct insight into src",
    "can be obtained from the process where the real or virtual photon hits , through a one - body current , either nucleon of a correlated pair and both nucleons are then ejected from the nucleus . a reliable and consistent treatment of these two competing processes , both produced by the exchange of mesons between nucleons , is needed .",
    "their role and relevance , however , can be different in different reactions and kinematics .",
    "it is thus possible to envisage situations where either process is dominant and can be separately investigated .",
    "interesting and complementary information is available from electron and photon - induced reactions .",
    "the electron probe is however preferable for the study of src .",
    "in fact , two - body currents predominantly contribute to the transverse components of the nuclear response .",
    "only these components are present in photon - induced reactions that appear thus generally dominated by two - body currents .",
    "also the longitudinal component , dominated by correlations , is present in electron - induced reactions .",
    "the possibility of independently varying the energy and momentum transfer of the exchanged virtual photon allows one to select kinematics where the longitudinal response and thus src are dominant .",
    "a combined study of @xmath3 and @xmath4 knockout is needed for a complete information .",
    "correlations are different in @xmath3 and @xmath4 pairs .",
    "they are stronger in @xmath4 pairs and thus in @xmath4 knockout due to the tensor force , that is predominantly present in the wave function of a @xmath4 pair . but also two - body currents are much more important in @xmath4 knockout , while they are strongly suppressed in @xmath3 knockout , where the charge - exchange terms of the two - body current do not contribute . therefore , the ( @xmath5 ) reaction was devised as the preferential process for studying src in nuclei .",
    "it is however clear that , since different effects can be emphasized in suitable conditions for different reactions , a combined study of @xmath3 and @xmath4 knockout induced by real and virtual photons is needed to unravel the different contributions and obtain a clear and complete information on @xmath6 correlations .",
    "exclusive reactions , for transitions to specific discrete eigenstates of the residual nucleus , are of particular interest for this study .",
    "one of the main results of the theoretical investigation is the selectivity of exclusive reactions involving different final states that can be differently affected by one - body and two - body currents  @xcite .",
    "thus , the experimental resolution of specific final states may act as a filter to disentangle the two reaction processes .",
    "@xmath2o is a suitable target for this study , due to the presence of discrete low - lying states in the experimental spectrum of @xmath7c and @xmath7n well separated in energy . from this point of view",
    ", @xmath2o is better than a light nucleus , which lacks specific final states .",
    "first measurements of the exclusive @xmath2o(@xmath5)@xmath7c reaction performed at nikhef  @xcite and mami  @xcite have basically confirmed the predictions of the theoretical model and have given clear evidence for src for the transition to the ground state of @xmath7c .",
    "this result gives rise to the hope that a similar separation between two - body currents and correlations is possible also in the ( @xmath8 ) reaction .",
    "this would be of particular interest for the study of tensor correlations .",
    "no data are available at present , but a proposal for the experimental study of the exclusive @xmath2o(@xmath8)@xmath7n reaction was approved in mainz and is in preparation  @xcite .    first pioneering ( @xmath9 ) experiments were performed in bonn  @xcite and tokyo  @xcite with poor statistical accuracy and energy resolution .",
    "further experiments carried out at mami achieved much better results  @xcite .",
    "these experiments , with a resolution of about 6 - 9 mev , were able to resolve the major shells from which the two nucleons are emitted .",
    "the first high - resolution @xmath2o(@xmath10)@xmath7n experiment able to separate final states was performed at maxlab in lund  @xcite , in a small energy range and with low statistics . a high - resolution experiment for the @xmath2o(@xmath10)@xmath7n and @xmath2o(@xmath11)@xmath7c reactions in the photon - energy range between 90 and 270 mev , aiming not only at separating final states but also at determining the momentum distributions of each state ,",
    "was approved in mainz and is in preparation  @xcite .",
    "results for a first test and feasibility study are presented in  @xcite .",
    "good opportunities to increase the richness of information available from two - nucleon knockout are offered by polarization measurements .",
    "reactions with polarized particles give access to a larger number of observables , hidden in the unpolarized case and whose determination can impose more severe constraints on theoretical models . some of these observables are expected to be sensitive to the small components of the transition amplitudes , which are generally masked by the dominant ones in the unpolarized cross section .",
    "these small components often contain interesting information on subtle effects and may thus represent a stringent test of theoretical models .",
    "this is the place where polarization observables enter , because in general they contain interference terms of the various matrix elements in different ways .",
    "thus , a small amplitude may be considerably amplified by the interference with a dominant one .    the asymmetry of the cross section for linearly polarized photons in ( @xmath11 ) and ( @xmath12 ) was studied in  @xcite .",
    "numerical results for exclusive @xmath3 and @xmath13 knockout from @xmath2o can be found in  @xcite .",
    "first measurements with polarized photon beams have been performed at legs on @xmath14he  @xcite and @xmath2o  @xcite and at mami on @xmath15c  @xcite . in these experiments , however , the energy resolution was not enough to separate specific final states of the residual nucleus .",
    "the case of the nucleon recoil polarization in ( @xmath0 ) and ( @xmath1 ) reactions where also the incident electron or the incident photon is polarized is considered here . the formalism and the polarization observables for ( @xmath0 ) and ( @xmath1 )",
    "are discussed in sects .  2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "some numerical examples for exclusive knockout reactions on @xmath2o are presented in sect .",
    "other examples and a more detailed discussion of the formalism are given in  @xcite .",
    "some numerical results obtained with a different theoretical model can be found also in  @xcite .",
    "the triple coincidence cross section for the electron induced reaction where two nucleons , with momenta @xmath17 and @xmath18 and energies @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are emitted is obtained from the contraction between the lepton tensor and the hadron tensor as a linear combination of 9 structure functions  @xcite @xmath21 \\big \\ } , \\label{eq : cssec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the energy of the outgoing electron and @xmath23 is a kinematic factor .",
    "the combination coefficients are obtained from the components of the lepton tensor and depend only on electron kinematics , with @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the electron scattering angle , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the energy and momentum transfer , respectively .",
    "the structure functions @xmath29 result from suitable combinations of the components of the hadron tensor  @xcite and depend on the kinematical variables @xmath27 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , on the angles @xmath33 , between @xmath17 and @xmath28 , @xmath34 , between @xmath18 and @xmath28 , and @xmath35 , between @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ". the three structure functions @xmath36 are obtained when also the incident electron is polarized with helicity @xmath37 .",
    "the number of structure functions is reduced in particular kinematics . when the angle @xmath38 , between the ( @xmath17 , @xmath28 ) plane and the electron scattering plane , is equal to @xmath39 or @xmath40 , the structure functions which are multiplied by @xmath41 or @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cssec ] ) do not contribute to the cross section .",
    "when @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath28 lie all in the same plane , we recover the case of the ( @xmath43 ) reaction and only 5 structure functions survive : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 . in a coplanar kinematics , where both conditions are fulfilled , only the 4 structure functions @xmath44 ,",
    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 survive . in the interesting case of the super - parallel kinematics , where the two outgoing nucleons are ejected parallel and antiparallel to the momentum transfer , only the two structure functions , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , survive  @xcite , as in the parallel kinematics of ( @xmath49 ) and in the inclusive ( @xmath50 ) reaction , and in principle",
    "can be separated by a rosenbluth plot .",
    "if one of the two outgoing nucleons has a given polarization , the components of the hadron tensor can be written in terms of the spin density matrix , that for a nucleon can be expanded in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath51 as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the outgoing nucleon polarization .",
    "thus , the components of the hadron tensor and therefore also the structure functions can be written as the sum of two parts , one independent and one dependent on @xmath54 . as a consequence of the spin-@xmath55 nature of the nucleon ,",
    "the dependence on the spin is at most linear , and the nine structure functions are written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the unit vector in the spin space . when the outgoing nucleon polarization is not detected and the cross section is summed over the spin quantum numbers of the outgoing nucleon , the spin independent structure functions @xmath58 go over to the 9 structure functions @xmath59 of the unpolarized case  @xcite .",
    "new structure functions are produced in the polarized case by the components of @xmath60 .",
    "the quantity @xmath60 is usually projected onto the basis of unit vectors given by @xmath61 ( parallel to the momentum @xmath62 of the outgoing particle ) , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , which define the cm helicity frame of the particle .",
    "thus , in the most general situation there are 9 unpolarized @xmath58 and 9 polarized @xmath65 structure functions for each direction @xmath66 , i.e. 36 structure functions .",

    "some of these observables , @xmath120 , @xmath146 , @xmath148 , and @xmath147 , vanish in the pw approximation and might thus be useful to investigate fsi .",
    "this example indicates that a combined study of the cross section and polarization obervables would provide an interesting tool to unravel and separately investigate the different contributions .",
    "this result is confirmed also by the results obtained for the @xmath2o(@xmath150)@xmath7n reaction  @xcite . in this case",
    "the role of all the different terms of the two - body current is in general more relevant than in @xmath3 knockout , but the different sensitivity of the various polarization observables to the theoretical ingredients , i.e. to the nuclear current , fsi , and to the treatment of @xmath6 correlations and nuclear structure effects in the two - nucleon overlap function , is confirmed .",
    "moreover , different effects can be emphasized in suitable kinematics .    in conclusion , the study of cross sections and polarizations in electron and photon - induced knockout reactions would result in a stringent test of the theoretical models and would provide an unique tool to shed light on the genuine nature of correlations in nuclei .",
