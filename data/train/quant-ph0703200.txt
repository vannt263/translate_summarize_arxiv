    "application of quantum mechanics to real world many - body systems meets with several difficulties , both of conceptual and pragmatic nature .",
    "a quantum mechanical system , which consists of at least two interacting subsystems exhibits a completely nonclassical property called `` entanglement''@xcite .",
    "it is a nonclassical correlation between systems which exists even between well separated subsystems @xcite .",
    "this unique property of a quantum system is nowadays viewed as a powerful resource in quantum information theory and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "also , on the conceptual side , `` entanglement '' with an environment ( degrees of freedom which inevitably interact with the quantum system of interest ) is the key mechanism to explain why typically quantum effects are not observed in macroscopic systems @xcite",
    ". therefore the rate at which pure initial quantum states loose their potentiality to retain information represents at the same time an old and a very modern problem .",
    "the first theoretical implementation of the system plus environment dynamics , in both the weak and strong damping regimes , was proposed and carried out by caldeira and leggett @xcite .",
    "they represent the environment as an infinity of oscillators , weakly coupled to the system of interest .",
    "several successful descriptions of experiments , specifically in quantum optics , were based on this type of model .",
    "more recently questions have been raised about the role of classical chaos on the information loss process for coupled quantum systems .",
    "in particular , the role of chaos in the decoherence process @xcite has become a matter of active research and also a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "one of the important issues now is : which type of environment is the more effective : the one involving an infinite number of degrees of freedom ( quantum brownian motion environment qbme ) , as proposed by caldeira and leggett , or an environment consisting of a single degree of freedom which presents one or more characteristics of chaotic behavior ?    in the standard model of decoherence ,",
    "a joint system consisting of a system ( s ) coupled to an environment ( e ) is described by a hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the system s hamiltonian , @xmath2 the environment s , and @xmath3 the interaction hamiltonian between s and e. let , for simplicity , the state space @xmath4 of the system be two - dimensional , and @xmath5 with @xmath6 the pauli matrix with eigenvalues @xmath7 and @xmath8 corresponding to spin `` up '' and `` down '' along the z - axis , and respective eigenfunctions @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in the coherent superposition @xmath11 with probability amplitudes @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that @xmath14 , @xmath6 has no definite value .",
    "the environment state ( hilbert ) space is @xmath15 , and we suppose e is initially in the state @xmath16 and the joint system in the pure ( nonentangled ) state @xmath17 we also assume for simplicity that the interaction @xmath3 in ( 1.1 ) is of the form @xmath18 then , after a time @xmath19 , the joint system will be in the state ( units are chosen such that @xmath20 ) @xmath21\\psi_{+}\\otimes\\psi_e^{+}(t ) + \\ ,       \\alpha_{-}\\exp [ i\\lambda t]\\psi_{-}\\otimes\\psi_e^{-}(t ) ) ,      \\eqno{\\rm{(1.6a)}}\\ ] ] with @xmath22\\psi_e(0 ) .",
    "\\eqno{\\rm{(1.6b)}}\\ ] ] we thus expect that the sensitivity to perturbation @xmath23 of a chaotic environment hamiltonian @xmath2 will , by ( 1.6a ) and ( 1.6b ) , result in quick decoherence : @xmath24 \\eqno{\\rm{(1.7)}}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are positive constants . the exponential `` orbital '' instability of @xmath2 is expected to lead via ( 1.6b ) to the exponential decay of the `` overlaps '' ( 1.7 ) ( think of gaussians centered at the corresponding orbits ) : the decoherence rate should therefore be proportional to the rate at which the environment is able to explore its phase space . these considerations are meant to explain , intuitively , why a ( large ) collection of harmonic oscillators - being stable systems - could , * in principle * , be less effective for purposes of decoherence than one sole unstable system .",
    "recently , r. blume - kohout and w. h. zurek @xcite analyzed decoherence due to a toy model for the environment , an inverted harmonic oscillator environment ( ihoe )  see also @xcite where conclusions similar to ours were obtained in chaotic systems .",
    "this is a nontrivial analytical tractable model whose importance as realized in @xcite is that it shares one very important characteristic with chaotic systems , namely exponential instability , defined by a positive upper lyapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "systems of this sort are called anosov systems",
    ". we shall be rather dealing with generalized anosov systems , in the sense that the flows take place in a manifold which is not compact .",
    "a simple example is the flow in the @xmath27 plane defined ( with @xmath28 positive ) by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the q coordinates of any two points moving with the flow get closer and closer as time proceeds , but the p coordinates separate exponentially fast , and hence the two points move apart exponentially fast @xcite .",
    "the directions of stable and unstable manifolds may vary from point to point , however , in contrast to the above example : this is the case of the parametric oscillator .",
    "the quantum analogues of the classical anosov systems have been dubbed * quantum anosov systems * @xcite : they exhibit a dynamic behavior which is at the same time rich and universal and they are characterized by having a positive upper quantum lyapunov exponent , as defined in @xcite and in the forthcoming ( [ lyapunov ] ) , and will be the subject of the present paper . given the importance of the subject , the difficulty in obtaining mathematically sound exact results which are eventually able to shed light onto these complex questions , we feel that a thorough analytical investigation of the qbme vs. ihoe and its generalizations to more realistic models of the class of linearly coupled quantum anosov systems , can be extremely useful .",
    "we focus on the limited but important class of gaussian states . in this context , a rigorous demonstration of the growth of the system s reduced von neumann entropy with the upper quantum lyapunov exponent for the aforementioned class of systems is given , showing thus that the rate of information loss is of more universal nature than that for the usual quantum brownian motion environment .",
    "our analytical results are only possible due to the fact that for ( possibly nonunitary ) gaussian dynamics the rate of information loss is completely governed by a combination of quadratures , i.e. the covariance matrix , also called schrdinger generalized uncertainty principle .",
    "we start by recalling a well known result @xcite .",
    "the most general 1-d gaussian state can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the displacement and the squeezing operator respectively and @xmath33 the thermal density operator with average number of excitations @xmath34 , @xmath35    note that except in the improper limit of @xmath36 , which corresponds to a squeezed state , density matrix is not a pure state .",
    "its schrodinger determinant is given by    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are either the position or its canonicaly conjugate momentum .",
    "we moreover have for the ( von neumann ) entropy @xmath40     = -\\tr\\left(\\hat{\\rho}\\ln \\hat{\\rho}\\right ) =     ( \\nu+1)\\ln(\\nu+1 )     -\\nu\\ln \\nu.\\ ] ] comparing with we obtain the relation between the entropy and the schrodinger determinant @xmath41    it is worthwhile to point out that holds for a wide range of ( gaussian ) states , ranging from thermal ( with @xmath42 , @xmath43 in ) to generalized coherent states ( the limit @xmath44 in , with @xmath45 in ) ; is thus a fundamental relation for gaussian states .",
    "we next consider an example of qbme widely used in the context of quantum optics , whose dynamics ( in the born - markov approximation ) is governed by the liouvillian @xmath46    + k(\\bar{n}_{b}+1 )    \\left (      2   \\hat{a}\\bullet \\hat{a}^\\dag      -\\hat{a}^\\dag   \\hat{a}\\bullet      -\\bullet \\hat{a}^\\dag   \\hat{a}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + k\\bar{n}_{b }    \\left (      2 \\hat{a}^\\dag \\bullet   \\hat{a }      - \\hat{a}\\hat{a}^\\dag \\bullet      -\\bullet   \\hat{a}\\hat{a}^\\dag \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the entropy is a function of @xmath47 only ( see ) , where @xmath48 and @xmath49    notice that the entropy for this type of system may be obtained without resorting to the calculation of the full density matrix , due to the fact that the information exchange between the system and bath is completely determined by a simple combination of quadratures .",
    "also the entropy saturates for long enough times .",
    "moreover , from equation it is apparent that information loss depends both on the environment constants as well as on the initial conditions .",
    "we now revisit the inverted harmonic oscillator example . following ( 1.1 ) ,",
    "we have now @xmath50 the above hamiltonian models two coupled harmonic oscillators : the first one , is a regular oscillator , with unit frequency , describing the system ; the second one , an inverted oscillator with squared frequency @xmath51 , describing the environment .",
    "this is a nontrivial tractable model .",
    "its importance , as has been realized in reference @xcite , relies on its relation to chaos .",
    "chaotic behavior requires besides stretching and folding in phase space , instabilities characterized by positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "although the above hamiltonian is defined on the whole of phase space and does not exhibit chaotic behavior , it displays positive lyapunov exponents like all anosov systems . in this section",
    "we establish a connection between lyapunov exponents and the rate of information loss , in this model , which we generalize to periodic quadratic anosov systems in the next section and exemplify with a physically more sound system of coupled parametric oscillators .",
    "the solution of the heisenberg equations of motion for the vector @xmath52 is as follows @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constant matrices .",
    "the former is invertible and the latter is diagonal with elements @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are _ real _ and _ positive _ constants .",
    "the ihe hamiltonian is a degenerate case of floquet s theorem , see the following .",
    "notice the existence of an unstable mode , with positive classical lyapunov exponent @xmath60 . in reference",
    "@xcite , upper quantum lyapunov exponents were defined , for systems of one degree of freedom with momentum @xmath61 and position @xmath62 , as follows @xmath63\\vert\\ ] ] were @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is any bounded operator , i.e.with finite norm given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 belongs to the hilbert space @xmath68 , and evolved in the heisenberg picture .",
    "this norm is nothing but the natural extension of the usual matrix norm on the square integrable sequences to an infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the operator @xmath69 is the generator of phase - space translations along a direction @xmath70 , and thus has a close resemblance to the definition of the classical lyapunov exponents ( see , e.g. , @xcite),but exploits the unitary nature of the quantum dynamics ( see @xcite for a discussion of these points ) .",
    "also in reference @xcite the definition was applied for one of the simplest paradigms of the transition from regular to unstable behavior in classical mechanics , namely the parametrically driven oscillator , given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a periodic function .",
    "the dynamical solution for @xmath73 and @xmath74 is a formally one dimensional version of , but with @xmath54 being a periodic matrix with the same period of the driving and @xmath55 a traceless matrix : this is floquet s theorem and the eigenvalues of @xmath55 are known as floquet exponents ( see @xcite for the proof and references ) . applying definition",
    "it was found that the upper quantum lyapunov exponent is precisely the real part of the maximal floquet exponent , which is positive in the classical instability region of the parametric oscillator , and zero in the stability region .",
    "the generalization to two degrees of freedom is straightforward @xcite and , applied to the ihe shows that the upper quantum lyapunov exponent is @xmath60 ( see equation eingenvalues of the ihe ) .",
    "let now @xmath75 , the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix , with @xmath76 , with @xmath77 of the form - , but now with @xmath78 , i.e. , the initial state being a tensor product of generalized coherent states . since @xmath79 is also gaussian , it continues to satisfy . in both cases , ihe and parametric oscillator ,",
    "the determinant is found to be of the form @xmath80 where the constant coefficients @xmath81 are given by cumbersome not particularly enlightening expressions .",
    "these coefficients , which are zero unless the sum of @xmath82 and @xmath83 is an even number , depend on the variances of the initial state and will be omitted here .",
    "for instance , one can find @xmath84 by looking at the asymptotic behavior of . for large enough times",
    "@xmath19 we have @xmath85 and the reduced entropy can be approximated by @xmath86 .",
    "this behavior , @xmath87 is precisely the one conjectured by zurek several years ago @xcite . since @xmath79 is also gaussian , applies to @xmath79 and thus the linear growth of @xmath88",
    "is interpreted , in the present case of a bipartite system , as a coherence loss , which , as we see , * depends only on the upper quantum lyapunov exponent * ( uqle ) and is thus universal for this class of systems , in contrast to qbme .",
    "note that complexity in the present models ( they are not explicitly soluble classically and are a paradigm of the transition from regular to irregular behavior , see @xcite ) is brought about by the external field , which depends on time in a nonlinear way ! for the models with frequency varying almost periodically with",
    "time - included in the present treatment - see @xcite : it may be considered as a prototype of complexity .",
    "this is one of the reasons why our extension of @xcite is significant : zurek s ihoe is * not * complex !",
    "as remarked in @xcite , section ii , p. 032104 - 2 , the ihe hamiltonian is unphysical in that in general the directions of stable and unstable manifolds can vary from point to point .",
    "thus it is of special interest to be able to consider as system 2 an arbitrary quantum anosov system . in what follows",
    "we illustrate this by taking both systems of the form , a case in which most computations can be done explicitly .",
    "this model is particularly rich : there is even a transition from a stability to an instability region , which has a physical interpretation in a model of quadrupole radio - frequency traps ( paul - penning traps ) ( see @xcite and references given there ) . for the sake of comparison , in figure 1 we plot the entropy obtained for a quantum brownian motion environment ( bme ) and for a iho reservoir ( parameters : ( i ) for the bme @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ; ( ii ) for the iho @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) .",
    "note that the increasing in the entropy in the case of bme saturates when the system thermalizes with the reservoir , while the increase in the case of iho is linear ( in the asymptotic regime ) .",
    "consider now a more realistic example , physically relevant in connection with paul traps @xcite , which models two coupled parametric oscillators with hamiltonian @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 in what follows we assume @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we remark that corresponds to the standard model ( 1.1 ) .",
    "the solution of the heisenberg equations of motion for the position and momentum operators can be written in terms of mathieu functions .",
    "for example , the momentum of the second oscillator , @xmath102 is given by the expression @xmath103 where the functions @xmath104 are given , respectively , by @xmath105 \\\\ u_2&= & \\cos^2\\theta\\frac{\\dot{s}(\\alpha_-,q,0)}{d_2 } c(\\alpha_-,q , t ) -\\sin^2\\theta\\frac{\\dot{s}(\\alpha_+,q,0)}{d_1 } c(\\alpha_+,q , t ) \\\\",
    "u_3&= & \\sin(2\\theta)\\left [ \\frac{c(\\alpha_-,q,0)}{2d_2 } s(\\alpha_-,q , t ) -\\frac{c(\\alpha_+,q,0)}{2d_1 } s(\\alpha_+,q , t )   \\right ] \\\\",
    "u_4&= & \\cos^2\\theta\\frac{c(\\alpha_-,q,0)}{d_2 } s(\\alpha_-,q , t ) -\\sin^2\\theta\\frac{c(\\alpha_+,q,0)}{d_1 } s(\\alpha_+,q , t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath106 depend on the constants appearing in the hamiltonian .",
    "the angle @xmath107 appearing in the expressions above is determined from the equality : @xmath108 .",
    "the functions @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the usual mathieu cosine and sine functions , and @xmath111 and @xmath112 their time derivatives . from the expression @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a periodic function with period @xmath115 and @xmath116 is the so - called characteristic exponent , it can be seen that , if @xmath117 the solutions exhibit an unstable behavior . otherwise the solutions are uniformly bounded .",
    "we are interested here in a situation in which the second uncoupled forced oscillator ( system ) is in the stability region and the other ( environment ) is in the unstable region . from the solutions of the heisenberg equations of motion and the definition of the upper quantum lyapunov exponent @xmath118 , it is a simple matter to show that @xmath119 .",
    "the connection with the information loss is made through the evaluation of schrodinger determinant for the second oscillator , which turns out to be of the form of equation . in this case , however , the coefficients @xmath81 are periodic functions of time . moreover @xmath120 and @xmath121",
    "for an initial gaussian state , @xmath122 , where @xmath123 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath84 are obtained from the asymptotic behavior of the entropy .",
    "in spite of exhibiting a complex , rich dynamical behavior , bipartite open quantum anosov systems display , in their instability region of parameters , a reduced von neumann entropy with linear growth determined by their uqle , a universal behavior for this class of systems , in contrast to qbme .",
    "this also permitted us to find a unified description of two opposite regimes , viz .",
    "of small and large coupling .",
    "it may , however , be argued that is * induced * by classical mechanics : the value of the uqle for the present models equals the classical maximal floquet exponent , which is positive in the region where the classical parameter @xmath124 lies in the instability region ( `` gap '' ) of hill s equation @xmath125 @xcite , as may abstracted from the last section .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the dynamics of the * observables * is classical .",
    "the space of * states * is , nevertheless , subject to the laws of quantum mechanics , without classical analogue , even in these cases : for this reason , for gaussian initial states , the entropy growth is to be interpreted , due to , as coherence loss , a purely quantum mechanical concept .",
    "indeed , in contrast to quantum mechanical entropy , the classical entropy is not an adequate quantity in information theory , because it is not even * positive * in general : ( @xcite , prop.1 ) .",
    "negative entropies are due to the fact that classical density distributions may be concentrated in regions of phase space @xmath126,contradicting the uncertainty principle ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "modified `` semiclassical entropies '' without this inconvenience have been defined by wehrl @xcite , but they incorporate the hilbert space structure of quantum physics , i.e , of a countable discrete basis of states . entanglement has indeed been described in terms of this modified entropy @xcite .",
    "thus an explanation by `` classical entanglement '' of phenomena of information loss is not possible in a full classical treatment involving the entropy .",
    "a still different approach is to regard entanglement in terms of the wigner function , i.e. , in phase space , which illuminates quite different and surprising aspects @xcite .",
    "we should caution the reader that , even in the framework of ( time - dependent ) quadratic hamiltonians , our approach misses an important element which is present in fully chaotic systems : * folding * , which is characteristic of a compact phase space .",
    "indeed , other papers have reported on the growth of relative entropy in the context of quantized chaotic systems ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the present treatment they rely , however , on approximations ( based on random matrix theory in @xcite , semiclassical analysis in @xcite ) , numerical studies and certain special constructions ( the nonunitary step in @xcite is constructed to mimic the presence of diffusion ) and special concepts ( a particularly phase - space measure of complexity was used in @xcite ) .",
    "we hope that the discrete weyl - wigner formalism developed in @xcite may be used to extend our treatment to some quantum chaotic systems .    as a final remark",
    ", we mention that other parameters could be invoked for environments characterized by generic chaotic systems : the diffusion coefficient is one of them , which is conjectured to be related to the lyapunov exponent and the hausdorff dimension @xcite .",
