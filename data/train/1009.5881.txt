    "a further reason of interest is that mpi are the tool to obtain information on the multi - parton correlations in the hadron structure .",
    "the inclusive cross sections of mpi processes depend in fact linearly on the multi - parton correlations@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the experimentally accessible information is represented by the scale factors which characterize the cross section with different numbers of mpi@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . while all different correlation terms contribute to the scale factors , in order to acquire a deeper insight into the non perturbative properties of the hadron structure , one needs to disentangle the effects of the different correlation terms . in the case of high energy proton - proton collisions ,",

    "the strength of double parton interactions is quantified by the value of the effective cross section .",
    "the inclusive cross section of double parton interactions in hadron - hadron collisions , @xmath0 , is in fact given by    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the inclusive cross sections corresponding to the interactions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 when @xmath4 and @xmath5 are identical while @xmath7 when the interactions @xmath4 and @xmath5 are distinguishable .",
    "in the simplest case the effective cross section @xmath8 represents the transverse interaction area where double parton interactions take place .",
    "a small value of @xmath8 may however be originated both by the relatively short transverse distance between the pairs of partons undergoing the double interaction and by a large dispersion of the distribution in multiplicity of the multi - parton distributions .",
    "it has been pointed out that the different effects can be separated by studying double parton interactions in collisions of hadrons with heavy nuclei@xcite@xcite . when different numbers of target nucleons are involved in the multiple process ,",
    "longitudinal and transverse correlations give in fact significantly different contributions to the cross section . by separating",
    "the contributions where different numbers of target nucleons are involved in the hard interaction one would hence be able to isolate the effects of longitudinal and transverse correlations . identifying unambiguously the final state of mpi may nevertheless represent a serious challenge in the case of heavy nuclei , due to the unbalance caused by rescatterings , the energy loss of the recoil jets etc . on the other hand dynamics",

    "we will avoid any assumption on the origin of correlations , whereas our goal will rather be to enlighten the connections between the different correlation parameters and the physical observables .",

    "notice that , in spite of that , one may still claim that final state interactions of the spectator are taken into account .",
    "the statement is supported by unitarity : if the nucleon is produced on mass shell and undergoes a final state interaction with the remnants of the other nucleon , final state interaction does not modify the inclusive cross section , since the spectator is not observed .",

    "thus unitarity allows us to replace the whole final state with a @xmath141 nucleon line , @xmath54 with a nucleon on mass shell .",
    "the different conservation relations , with respect to the case discussed in the previous paragraph , give different relations in the transverse coordinates and one obtains that the integration on the @xmath5 coordiante is decoupled from the others which , on the contrary , are linked by the relation @xmath142 .    by following the steps and introducing the functions and the variables of the previous paragraph and keeping into account the presence of two target nucleons , one obtains the expression    @xmath143    the double parton distribution of the bound nucleon",

    "to the purpose of gaining some understanding of the effect of the correlations in the hadron structure on the double parton scattering cross section , in the present paragraph we discuss some basic properties of the correlation functions .",

    "apart from the terms representing the double parton correlation , all inputs are well known quantities .",
    "one may hence conclude that , by measuring double parton collisions in @xmath9 interactions , even a reasonably limited statistics should allow obtaining a reliable indication on the size of @xmath168 which , in turn , will permit a model independent estimate of the typical transverse distances between different parton pairs of the structure of the hadron .",
    "the present discussions shows that @xmath9 and , more in general , the interactions of hadrons with light nuclei represent the tool to measure the multi - parton correlations of the hadron structure , allowing not only to measure the scale factors , which quantify the rate of the different multiple parton interactions in proton - proton collisions , but also to obtain , for the first time , the additional information needed to disentangle the different correlation terms of the multiparton structure of the hadron . although interactions of deuterons with nuclei and between polarized proton beams have been studied at rhic , no plans are unfortunately foreseen at rhic to study the interactions of protons with light nuclei . in spite of the limited rate of double parton collisions expected at the rhic energy ,",
    "double parton collisions have been measured by the afs collaboration in proton - proton collisions at the cern isr@xcite , where the c.m .",
    "energy was sizably smaller .",
    "measuremets of double parton collisions in @xmath9 interactions should hence be feasible at rhic , while the inclusion of the study of @xmath9 interactions in the rhic physics program would give the possibility to obtain unprecedented information on the two - body correlations between partons of the hadron structure and hence on the three dimensional parton structure of the hadron .",
    "of course the study of double parton collisions in @xmath9 interactions would be greatly facilitated at the lhc , where the much larger parton luminosity would allow to perform a detailed study of various multi - parton scattering channels in a much broader range of fractional momenta , which might represents a good motivation to support the option of running , at some stage , light nuclear beams at the lhc .",
