    "when interactions between the microscopic components of a system act on a length scale comparable to the size of the system , one may call them `` long - range '' : for instance , the inverse - square law of the gravitational force between two point masses which is one of the most celebrated and oldest laws in physics . in the many particles world , it is responsible for dramatic collective effects such as the gravothermal catastrophe  @xcite or the gravitational clustering which is the main mechanism leading to the formation of the structure of galaxies in the present universe .",
    "beyond gravitation , such long - range interactions are present in various physical fields , either as fundamental or as effective interactions : in plasma physics @xcite , two dimensional ( 2d ) fluid dynamics @xcite , degenerated quantum gases @xcite , ion trapping @xcite , to cite only these works .",
    "long - range interactions deeply influence the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of such systems . at the thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "long - range interactions are at the origin of very peculiar properties , especially for attractive systems : the specific heat may be negative ; canonical ( fixed temperature ) and microcanonical ( fixed energy ) ensembles are not equivalent .",
    "these special features have been known for a long time in the astrophysics community , in the context of self gravitating systems .",
    "after the seminal works of lynden - bell and wood @xcite and thirring @xcite , many contributions followed on this subject ( see , for instance , @xcite for a recent review ) , so that the equilibrium characteristics of attractive long - range interacting systems are theoretically well established .",
    "this situation is in striking contrast with the experimental side of the problem : there is currently no controllable experimental system exhibiting the predicted peculiarities .",
    "there have been some proposals to remedy to this situation : odell _ et _ _ al .",
    "_ @xcite have suggested creating an effective @xmath0 potential between atoms in a bose - einstein condensate using off - resonant laser beams ; more recently , dominguez _ et _",
    "@xcite have proposed taking advantage of the capillary interactions between colloids to mimic two - dimensional gravity , and golestanian  @xcite has suggested experiments using thermally driven colloids .",
    "however , these proposals have not been implemented yet , and so far the dream of a tabletop galaxy remains elusive .",
    "the key results of this paper are to show some experimental evidences of a gravitational - like interaction in a quasi - one - dimensional ( hereafter 1d ) test system consisting in a cold gas of strontium atoms in interaction with two contra - propagating quasi - resonant lasers .",
    "to our knowledge , it is the first experimental realization of the 1d gravitational toy model , which can be compared with the theoretical predictions developed for more than @xmath1 years by the astrophysical and statistical physics community . in the stationary regime ,",
    "the cloud spatial distribution is in agreement with the well - known @xmath2 law for the 1d self - gravitating gas at thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "moreover , the long - range attractive nature of the force is confirmed studying the cloud s size dependency as a function of the number of atoms . out of equilibrium , the breathing oscillation frequency increases with the strength of the interaction as it should be for attractive interactions .",
    "quantitatively our experimental results are in agreement with the expected @xmath3 force with @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we start from the radiation pressure exerted by the lasers and explain under which circumstances this force becomes analog to a 1d gravitational force .",

    "the gravitational potential @xmath5 between two particles can be expressed through the poisson equation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the coupling constant , @xmath8 the mass of the particle and @xmath9 a numerical constant which depends on the dimension .",
    "the solution of the poisson equation for the interpaticle potential @xmath5 in three dimension is the well - known @xmath10 and in 1d , @xmath11 ( for a review on 1d gravitational systems see , e.g. , @xcite ) . after using a mean - field approach ( see below ) , we will show that such a potential should be at play in our experiment , under precise circumstances ( see section [ subsec : stationary_solution ] ) .",
    "we start considering a quasi-1d @xmath12cold atomic gas + 1d quasi - resonant laser beams@xmath13 system ; an atomic gas , with a linear density @xmath14 , is in interaction with two contra - propagating laser beams .",
    "the two beam intensities @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , respectively propagating in the positive and negative direction , are much smaller than the atomic line saturation intensity @xmath18",
    ". thus the atomic dipolar response is linear .",
    "the radiation pressure force of the lasers on an atom , having a longitudinal velocity @xmath19 , is given by @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath22 the bare linewidth of the atomic transition , @xmath23 the wave number , and @xmath24 the frequency detuning between an atom at rest and the lasers .",
    "for a cloud of @xmath25 atoms , the attenuation of the laser intensity is given by : @xmath26 where @xmath14 is the normalized linear density profile and @xmath27 is the average absorption cross - section for a single atom .",
    "@xmath28 is the normalized longitudinal velocity distribution and @xmath29 is the transverse section of the cloud . at equilibrium @xmath28",

    "the second term in eq .  ( [ eq : vfp ] ) is an inertial one , whereas the third one describes a harmonic trapping force being a good approximation of the dipolar trap used in the experiment @xcite . indeed the dipolar potential , in the longitudinal axe of interest , can be written as @xmath36 with @xmath37 mm , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",

    ".   neglects atomic losses and dependencies in position and velocity of the velocity diffusion coefficient .",
    "one notes that the attractive force coming from the beams absorption ( eq .   and ) is known since the early days of laser cooling and trapping @xcite .",
    "however , in an usual 3d setting this attractive force is dominated by the repulsive force due to photons reabsorption @xcite , which , in the small optical depth limit , may be seen as an effective repulsive coulomb force . by contrast , in a 1d configuration with an elongated cloud along the cooling laser beams , the probability of photons reabsorption is reduced by a factor of the order of @xmath48 , in comparison with the isotropic cloud having the same longitudinal optical depth . in our experiment ,",
    "the reduction factor is about @xmath49 , so that the repulsive force can be safely ignored .",
    "similar but weaker reduction of the probability of photons reabsorption is also expected for the 2d geometry , which opens the possibility of experimental systems analogous to 2d self - gravitating systems .      in order to solve eq .",
    "we assume that the system can be described using a fluid approach : the velocity distribution at time @xmath50 does not depend on the position , except for a macroscopic velocity @xmath51 .",
