    "at the interaction point ( ip ) of the ilc , beam - beam effects due to the strong electromagnetic fields that the bunches experience during collisions cause a mutual focusing , called pinch effect , which enhances the luminosity in the case of collisions .",
    "the opposite is true for collisions . in this case",
    "the luminosity is reduced by mutual defocusing , or anti - pinching and is only about 20@xmath0 of the one ( see fig .",
    "[ lumi - gp ] ) .",
    "moreover this repulsion between the bunches causes the luminosity to drop with a vertical offset at the ip much more rapidly for the case than for .",
    "another effect of this strong repulsive electromagnetic field is the much steeper beam - beam deflection curve ( see fig .",
    "[ deflection - gp ] ) . since the fast intra - train feedback system used to maintain the beams in collision at the ip @xcite exploits these deflections as its main signal and because of the higher sensitivity to the vertical offsets , it is important to compare average performances for and for a set of representative values of initial beam offsets and bunch - to- bunch jitter .",
    "a simplified simulation of the feedback has been carried out using parametrized information from the last bunch crossing with a single proportional factor to relate the measured deflection angle of the outgoing beam to the correction of the offset at the ip @xcite . at frequencies of a few hz corresponding to the ilc train repetition rate , offsets of order of hundreds of nm",
    "are predicted ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition bunch - to - bunch jitter of a fraction of the beam size can be expected .",
    "the simulation has been done for different assumptions on the initial train offset and bunch - to - bunch jitter , and including a 10@xmath0 error on the correction to represent the measured uncertainties .",
    "the factor relating the correction to the measured deflection angle was optimized , independently for and beam parameters , to maximize the speed of the correction without amplifying the bunch - to - bunch jitter by over - correcting .",
    "nominal beam parameters @xcite were used at @xmath1 500  gev .",
    "the average luminosity loss over a train was found to be almost independent of the offset at the beginning of the pulse for the range considered ( up to 500  nm ) .",
    "the luminosity loss was however found to be a factor 2 greater compared to for the same assumption on the jitter.this is due to the greater sensitivity to the vertical offset .",
    "the ability to decrease this sensitivity with alternative beam parameters could be important if jitter conditions are worse than expected , e.g. during early ilc operation .    with this purpose , sets of alternative beam parameters with smaller disruption have been derived by decreasing the bunch length and varying the transverse beam sizes , in order to maximize the luminosity while limiting the beamstrahlung energy loss to 5@xmath0 ( see table  [ parameters_table ] ) .",
    "these alternative parameters have increased luminosity , and some of them smaller sensitivity to the ip offset , compared to those obtained for the nominal case for .",
    "the average train luminosity for different amplitudes of the jitter applied to each beam , is also improved compared to the nominal parameters ( see fig.[feedback_eminus ] ) .",
    ".luminosity and beamstrahlung energy loss for collision for different parameter sets with a beam energy of 250  gev .",
    "the nominal values for the beam sizes at the ip are @xmath2300  @xmath3 m and @xmath4655.2/5.7  nm and the nominal intensity is @xmath5 particles . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ parameters_table ]        an additional set of parameters is also being investigated with only half of the bunch charge , while keeping the same number of bunches per train .",
    "it has a smaller peak luminosity ( see table  [ parameters_table ] ) and similar sensitivity to ip offsets as the nominal case .",
    "such a parameter set could be important for early ilc operation and flexibility .",
    "the optics of the final focus ( ff ) ( corresponding to the 20  mrad crossing - angle geometry ) has been refitted to obtain the new @xmath6-functions at the ip for the alternative beam parameters in table  [ parameters_table ] . only the quadrupoles upstream of the chromatic correction section and the sextupoles were readjusted .",
    "this allows to maintain the geometry and overall optimization of high order effects .",
    "the @xmath6-functions and the dispersion for the parameter set 2 in table  [ parameters_table ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ 20mrad - par2 ] .",
    "the optical bandwidth for the different sets of parameters has been studied , considering beams with a uniform flat momentum distribution with an energy spread of 0.1@xmath0 .",
    "the distribution of particles at the entrance of the ff , was created with placet @xcite for different average momentum offsets .",
    "the beam was then tracked through the ff with mad8 @xcite and used as input for guinea - pig to compute the luminosity .",
    "the results ( see fig .  [ bandwidth-20mrad ] ) show similar off - momentum behavior for all parameter sets , with the alternative sets having better peak performance .",
    "the effective parameters corresponding to the disrupted beam have been computed along the extraction line for the different beam parameter sets in table [ parameters_table ] ( see fig .  [ extraction - optics-20mrad ] ) , and for the different parameters sets suggested for in @xcite .",
    "the largest values found for the @xmath6-functions in the and cases were comparable .",
    "the tracking of the disrupted beams has been simulated with bdsim @xcite and the power losses along the line have been computed . for",
    "the parameter set 2 the losses are smaller than for the high luminosity parameters for ( see fig .",
    "[ extraction - tracking-20mrad ] ) .          in the 2  mrad crossing - angle geometry",
    "the spent beam is transported off - axis through the last defocussing quadrupole of the final focus .",
    "the kick produced by this quadrupole is used to extract the spent beam .",
    "this scheme does nt work for the option unless one can reverse the signs of the focusing and defocusing final doublet quadrupoles ( and sextupoles ) , while keeping at least the strength of the last quadrupole to maintain the kick needed for extraction .",
    "a first attempt in this direction @xcite indicated that this was feasible , but large @xmath7-value had to be used at the ip to limit the vertical beam size in the final doublet , which is important to keep reasonable collimation depth .",
    "this resulted however in about a factor 2 lower peak luminosity .",
    "improvements with half the bunch length are also being investigated , with for example @xmath8 mm . in this case , more acceptable overall performance is expected .",
    "for the 20 mrad crossing - angle geometry , beam parameters can be obtained for the option by decreasing the bunch length , with improved peak luminosity , smaller sensitivity to ip offsets , and similar beam losses in the extraction line as those found for .",
    "for the 2 mrad crossing - angle , it is necessary to go to larger vertical beam sizes at the ip , which decreases the luminosity . with half of the bunch length and optimizing the transverse beam sizes taking into account collimation requirements , a first study indicates that some of this reduction can be recovered . in the near future , these problems will be studied to further characterize the option at the ilc ."
