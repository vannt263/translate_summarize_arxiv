    "in the standard model , cp violation is implemented by the existence of ckm complex parameters .",

    ", one could explore the asymmetry associated with the dalitz interference between intermediary states in three body @xmath7 decays .",
    "this was initially proposed for @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath17 plays a fundamental role as reference channel . however , the method is statistically limited by the low contribution of the cabibbo suppressed amplitude @xmath18 , estimated on the already observed cabibbo allowed @xmath19 channel @xcite . recently",
    ", new effort is being made to explore @xmath0 in @xmath20 decays . while some approaches requires time - dependent analysis @xcite , we first showed @xcite how to proceed with an untagged analysis , with the benefit of higher statistics .",

    "the major intermediate sates for @xmath21and @xmath22 @xcite , are resumed in table [ tab : bkpipicontrib ] with the respective tree and penguin contributions , followed by ckm weak phases contained in the amplitude . since",
    "magnitudes and phases extracted by the fit procedure are the overall contributions , it s not possible to isolate and measure @xmath0 in a simple amplitude analysis of @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath2 and @xmath5 .    .resonances and dominant contributions from @xmath25 decays .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one important issue concerning the @xmath0 extraction , is the size of the ratio @xmath29 and the phase difference @xmath30 from the tree and penguin amplitudes of the @xmath31 resonance .",
    "the theoretical knowledge of these quantities is model dependent .",

    "the joint fit applied to the real data , will be able to define which theoretical approach is more adequate , since it is possible to measure the parameters under discussion . to our study , we choose @xmath34 and generate the experiments with @xmath35 .",
    "if in the unconstrained analysis , the three hypothesis prove to be correct , we can assume that the @xmath31 resonances parameters from @xmath2 and @xmath5 are given by the following tree and penguin sum : @xmath36 in this case , we can use the scheme ( [ eq : esquemag ] ) to extract @xmath0 using a constrained fit , where the penguin amplitude is fixed and the tree parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are directly extracted from @xmath31 .",

    "we carried a fast mc study to estimate the errors associated to the joint fit technique . assuming a relatively low statistics for the anchor resonance @xmath17 we obtained @xmath0 with a @xmath42 error .    during the analysis",
    "we can measure cp violation by counting the number of events from @xmath2 and @xmath5 , information extracted in the joint fit , or exploring dalitz symmetries as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we can also measure the ratio and phase difference from tree and penguin amplitudes of the @xmath31 resonance , defining which theoretical approach , factorisable or non - factorisable is more adequate .",
    "the method presented here is competitive with the other approaches to determine the ckm @xmath0 angle @xcite and needs the high statistics expected for the lhcb experiment , due to the small contribution of the reference channel @xmath43 .",
    "however , in the case that the @xmath44 resonance is dominated by the @xmath45 component @xcite , or even if the ratio between the tree and penguin is negligible @xcite , the @xmath46 amplitude could take place of the charmonium as a reference channel in the analysis .",
