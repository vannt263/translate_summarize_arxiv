    "the common envelope ( ce ) phase was proposed by @xcite to explain the small orbital separation of compact binaries such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and double white dwarf binaries , because a much larger orbital separation of between approximately 10 and 1000 r@xmath5 was required in order to accommodate the giant progenitor of the white dwarf .",
    "( for reviews see iben & livio 1993 , taam & sandquist 2000 )",
    ".    in the pre - ce phase of evolution the initially more massive stellar component ( which we henceforth denote as the primary ) evolves off the main sequence first .",
    "depending on the orbital separation of the binary , the primary will fill its roche lobe on either the giant or asymptotic giant branch and initiate mass transfer .",
    "if the giant primary possesses a deep convective envelope ( i.e. the convective envelope has a mass of more than approximately 50 per cent of the giant s mass ; hjellming & webbink 1987 ) the giant will expand in response to rapid mass loss . as a result",
    ", the giant s radius expands relative to its roche lobe radius increasing the mass transfer rate . as a consequence of this run - away situation , mass transfer commences on a dynamical timescale .",
    "the companion main sequence star ( henceforth the secondary ) can not incorporate this material into its structure quickly enough and therefore expands to fill its own roche lobe .",
    "the envelope eventually engulfs both the core of the primary and the main sequence secondary .",
    "the friction the stellar components experience due to their motion within the ce extracts energy and orbital angular momentum from the orbit causing the orbital separation to decrease .",
    "if enough of the orbital energy is imparted on to the ce before the stellar components merge , then the ce may be ejected from the system leaving the core of the primary ( now the white dwarf ) and the secondary star at a greatly reduced separation .    despite extensive three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. sandquist , taam & burkert 2000 ) ,",
    "the physics of the ce phase remains poorly understood , including the efficiency with which the ce is ejected from the system . due to the difficulty in modelling the ce phase",
    ", binary population synthesis calculations commonly resort to describing the ce phase in terms of a simple energy budget argument .",
    "a fraction @xmath0 of the orbital energy released as the binary tightens , @xmath6 , is available to unbind the giant s envelope from the core .",
    "hence if the binding energy is @xmath7 we have @xmath8 ( e.g. de kool 1992 ; de kool & ritter 1993 ; willems & kolb 2004 ) .",
    "the efficiency @xmath0 is a free parameter with values @xmath9 , albeit values larger than unity are discussed , depending on what terms are included in the quantity @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite used this approach to reconstruct the common envelope phase for the observed sample of double white dwarf binaries .",
    "they found that @xmath10 for the first phase of mass transfer , which is unphysical .",
    "this led them to test an alternative description of the ce phase , based on the change in the orbital angular momentum of the binary , @xmath11 , during the ce phase .",
    "their ` @xmath1-algorithm ' follows the prescription given by @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mass of the giant s envelope , @xmath14 is the total mass of the binary just before the onset of the ce phase and @xmath15 is the total angular momentum of the binary at this point .",
    "the free parameter @xmath1 describes the specific angular momentum of the ejected material ( in this case the ce ) in units of the specific angular momentum of the binary system .",
    "indeed , @xcite found further support for the @xmath1-algorithm in a few observed pre - cvs and sub - dwarf b plus main sequence star binaries .",
    "@xcite suggested that some systems may avoid the in - spiral in a ce phase altogether as a result of wind ejection of the envelope material from the system , which arises due to super - eddington accretion on to the companion star . employing analytical approximations for the evolution of such systems",
    ", @xcite found that both the canonical energy budget approach and the @xmath1-algorithm can describe the outcomes of the proposed mechanism .",
    "a few observed double white dwarf binaries could also be explained by @xmath16 , for example , pg 1115 + 166 @xcite .",
    "this has led to the suggestion that an energy source other than the release of orbital energy is being used to eject the ce from the system , such as thermal energy and recombination energy of ionized material within the giant s envelope ( han et al .",
    "1994 , han et al .",
    "1995 , dewi & tauris 2000 , webbink 2007 ) .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggested that rather than @xmath0 being a constant , global value for all binary systems , it is a function of one of the binary orbital parameters . in this spirit , @xcite calculated the present day population of post - common envelope binaries ( pcebs ) and cvs if @xmath0 is a function of the secondary mass .",
    "the investigation was motivated by the fact that very few , if any , cvs with brown dwarf secondaries at orbital periods below 77 mins have been detected .",
    "this appears to be in conflict with @xcite who estimated from his models that such systems should make up approximately 15 per cent of the current cv population .",
    "@xcite suggested that this discrepancy may be a result of the decreasing energy dissipation rate of orbital energy within the ce for decreasing secondary mass , and that below some cut - off mass , a ce merger would be unavoidable .",
    "previous population synthesis studies into the ce phase of white dwarf - main sequence binaries(e.g .",
    "de kool & ritter 1993 ; willems & kolb 2004 ) just considered the value of the envelope s binding energy , @xmath7 , due to the gravitational binding energy of the primary s envelope , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass contained within the radius @xmath19 of the primary , @xmath20 is the mass of the giant s core , and @xmath21 is the universal gravitational constant . in population synthesis",
    "studies the binding energy is commonly approximated as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the radius of the primary star , with a suitable choice for the dimensionless factor @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for example , used a constant , global value of @xmath25 . as @xcite pointed out , however , this may lead to an overestimation of the giant envelope s binding energy for large radii , requiring more energy to eject it .    in the present study we apply population synthesis techniques to calculate the present day population of pcebs by considering the aforementioned theoretical descriptions of the ce phase .",
    "we consider different constant , global values of @xmath0 and @xmath24 , @xmath0 as a function of secondary mass , and @xmath24 calculated according to the internal structure of the giant star and the internal energy of its envelope .",
    "also , we consider the description of the ce phase is terms of the angular momentum budget of the binary system .",
    "we then compare our model pceb populations to the observed sample of white dwarf - main sequence star ( wd+ms ) and sub - dwarf - main sequence star ( sd+ms ) binaries from rkcat @xcite , edition 7.10 ( 2008 ) , and newly detected pcebs from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( rebassa - mansergas et al .",
    "2007 ; rebassa - mansergas et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we also compare this observational sample to our theoretical population for a range of initial secondary mass distributions .",
    "our suite of population models represents a major advance over the work by @xcite who considered only the formation rate of pcebs , and a simplified estimate of their present - day populations based on birth and death rates",
    ". our models also cover a more comprehensive parameter space than those by @xcite , and we assess the model distributions against the location of observed systems in all three system parameters ( component masses and period ) simultaneously .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we give our computational method and models describing the ce phase . in section 3",
    "we present our results , which are discussed in section 4 .",
    "we conclude our investigation in section 5 .",
    "we employ the same method as used in @xcite to calculate the binary population , and so we present only a summary here .",
    "we first calculate the unweighted zero - age pceb population ( i.e. wd+ms systems that have just emerged from a ce phase ) with biseps ( willems & kolb 2002 ; willems & kolb 2004 ) .",
    "biseps employs the single star evolution ( sse ) formulae described in @xcite and a binary evolution scheme based on that described by @xcite .",
    "we then use a second code introduced in @xcite to calculate the present day population of pcebs .",
    "this latter step makes use of evolutionary tracks , calculated by biseps , for each pceb configuration , from the moment the pceb forms to the point at which the binary ceases to be a pceb ( for example , if the system becomes semi - detached ) .",
    "biseps therefore produces a library of pceb evolutionary tracks which contain , depending on the population model , between @xmath26 and @xmath27 pceb sequences .",
    "biseps evolves a large number of binary systems , initially consisting of two zero - age main sequence stellar components .",
    "the stars are assumed to have a population i chemical composition and the orbits are circular at all times .",
    "the initial primary and secondary masses are in the range 0.1 to 20 m@xmath5 , while the initial orbital periods range from 0.1 to 100 000 d. there is one representative binary configuration per grid cell within a three - dimensional grid consisting of 60 logarithmically spaced points in primary and secondary mass and 300 logarithmically spaced points in orbital period . hence we evolve approximately @xmath28 binaries for a maximum evolution time of 10 gyr . for symmetry reasons only systems where",
    "@xmath29 are evolved .",
    "the probability of a zero - age pceb forming with a given white dwarf mass @xmath30 , secondary mass @xmath31 and orbital period @xmath32 is determined by the probability of the binary s initial parameters .",
    "we assume that the initial primary mass , @xmath33 is distributed according to the initial mass function ( imf ) given by @xcite .",
    "the distribution of initial secondary masses , @xmath34 , is obtained from the initial mass ratio distribution ( imrd ) , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , and @xmath35 has a power - law dependence on @xmath37 .",
    "alternatively , we determine @xmath34 from the same imf as used for the initial primary mass . for brevity , we adopt the acronym ` imfm2 ' for this latter case .",
    "our standard model is a flat distribution , i.e. @xmath38 . finally , we follow @xcite and @xcite and adopt a logarithmically flat distribution in initial orbital separations .",
    "we assume that all stars in the galaxy are formed in binaries , and that the galaxy has an age of 10 gyr .",
    "the aforementioned distributions are then convolved with a constant star formation rate normalised such that one binary with @xmath39 m@xmath5 is formed each year , consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "this gives an overall star formation rate of @xmath40 yr@xmath41 .",

    "v651 mon _ contains a 0.4 m@xmath5 hot white dwarf primary with an a - type secondary star .",
    "this system lies within a planetary nebula , which could be the remnant of a ce phase .",
    "however , @xcite suggest that the planetary nebula may have formed when the compact primary underwent a shell flash , and instead the binary formed via a thermally unstable rlof phase . as for ik peg",
    ", we calculate the present day population of wd+ms systems with @xmath48 that formed through a thermally unstable rlof phase , shown in the left panel of figure [ brlof ] .",
    "this is compared with the location of v651 mon shown as indicated by the arrow . from figure [ brlof ]",
    "it appears hence feasible that v651 mon formed from a case b rlof phase .    to obtain the possible progenitor of v651 mon",
    ", we first find the calculated wd+ms configuration which formed through the case b ttmt channel which is situated closest to the location of v651 mon in @xmath49 space .",
    "if @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the difference between the observed white dwarf mass @xmath53 , secondary mass @xmath54 and orbital period @xmath55 of v651 mon and a calculated wd+ms binary configuration , then the normalised distance , @xmath56 , in @xmath49 space is given by @xmath57 thus we require the wd+ms binary configuration that gives the smallest value of @xmath56 . we find that @xmath56 is minimised for @xmath58 m@xmath5 , @xmath59 m@xmath5 and @xmath60 d. this system has a zams progenitor with @xmath61 m@xmath5 , @xmath62 m@xmath5 and @xmath63 d.    while the secondary mass of this wd+ms configuration is within the measured uncertainty of the secondary mass in v651 mon , its white dwarf mass is not , and in fact underestimates the white dwarf mass of v651 mon . @xcite and @xcite suggest that v651 mon may have formed with enhanced mass loss from the primary star before it filled its roche lobe .",
    "thus , a more massive progenitor primary than the one found in our best - fit wd+ms configuration may have formed the white dwarf . if enough mass is lost from the primary due to enhanced wind losses before it fills its roche lobe to sufficiently lower the mass ratio , @xmath64 , then the resulting mass transfer will be dynamically stable .",
    "one of the main formation channels of sd+ms binaries is via the ce phase @xcite ; if the primary star fills its roche lobe near the tip of the first giant branch , and the ce is ejected from the system , then a short - period binary with an sd star is formed once the helium core is ignited .",
    "@xcite found that the mass of the sdb star ranges from approximately 0.32 to 0.48 @xmath65 .",
    "the typical mass for a sdb star is approximately 0.46 m@xmath5 .",
    "this appears to be broadly consistent with the observed masses of sd stars ( see table [ table02 ] ) .",
    "the mass of the sub - dwarf in v1379 aql is somewhat smaller than the calculated lower limit by @xcite , while the sub - dwarfs in uu sge and kv kel are more massive than the calculated upper limit in sub - dwarf mass .",
    "the formation of sub - dwarf stars is affected by the wind loss of the giant s envelope , the metallicity of the primary , and the degree of convective overshooting of the primary .",
    "a detailed consideration of sdb binaries is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "instead , we simply plot the observed sample of sd+ms binaries over our calculated distributions of the wd+ms pcebs ( see figure  [ multiplot2 ] , for model a and @xmath38 , in the same style as figure  [ multiplot ] ) , thereby assuming that there is little orbital evolution of these systems by the time the sdb stars become white dwarfs .",
    "this is justified as follows :    the evolution of sd+ms binaries will be driven by wind losses from the subdwarf primary with a mass loss rate of approximately @xmath66 m@xmath5 yr@xmath41 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , as well as systemic angular momentum losses . for the observed sample of sd+ms systems in table [ table02 ] , @xmath67 m@xmath5 in all cases , and so gravitational wave radiation will therefore be the only sink of orbital angular momentum . during the lifetime of an sdb ( i.e. the core helium burning time ) of approximately few@xmath68 yr @xcite , we estimate a relative change in the binary s orbital period of less than about 7 per cent .",
    "figure [ multiplot2 ] shows that , as with the observed wd+ms systems , there are observed sd+ms systems that can not be explained by our standard model .",
    "these are ff aqr and v1379 aql .",
    "their locations are indicated in the left panel of figure [ outliers ] by the arrows .",
    "we discuss these systems individually to determine whether they are in fact pcebs .    _",
    "v1379 aql _ this system contains a k - giant secondary and an sdb primary , which may be a nascent helium white dwarf @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite argue that v1379 aql formed from a thermally unstable rlof phase . as a consequence of the synchronous rotation of the secondary , the system exhibits rs cvn chromospheric activity due to the k - giant s enhanced magnetic activity .",
    "this is likely to occur if the system had a previous episode of rlof , rather than if the system has emerged from a ce phase .",
    "@xcite suggest that the progenitor binary of v1379 aql had @xmath69 m@xmath5 and @xmath70 m@xmath5 .",
    "the secondary star would have completed one half of its main sequence lifetime by the time the primary evolved to become a giant after approximately @xmath71 yr @xcite . if a ce phase did occur , then the secondary would still have been on the main sequence , and hence possess an insubstantial convective envelope .",
    "consequently , magnetic braking would be ineffective in shrinking the orbital separation sufficiently for tidal interactions to enforce synchronous rotation of the secondary star .",
    "@xcite , in reconstructing a possible ce phase for this system , could not find a solution for @xmath0 , and cited this as evidence for their alternative ce description in terms of the angular momentum balance .",
    "we suggest that no solution was found because of the possibility that v1379 aql formed from a thermally unstable rlof phase .",
    "the left panel of figure [ brlof ] compares the theoretical wd+ms systems with @xmath48 that formed through a thermally unstable rlof phase with the location of v1379 aql shown by the arrow .",
    "it appears hence feasible that v1379 aql formed through this evolutionary channel .",
    "as with v651 mon , we apply equation ( [ delta ] ) to find the wd+ms configuration which lies the closest to the location of v1379 aql in @xmath49 .",
    "doing this we find a wd+ms configuration with @xmath72 m@xmath5 , @xmath73 m@xmath5 and @xmath74 d. this system forms from a zams progenitor with @xmath75 m@xmath5 , @xmath76 m@xmath5 and @xmath77 d.    the mass of the white dwarf in our best - fit wd+ms configuration once again underestimates that of v1379 aql . as for v651",
    "mon,@xcite suggest that the primary star in v1379 aql also underwent enhanced mass loss before it filled its roche lobe .",
    "thus , the mass ratio , @xmath64 , was decreased sufficiently so that a dynamically unstable rlof phase was avoided .",
    "the actual progenitor primary of v1379 aql may therefore have been more massive than what we have predicted in our calculations .",
    "note also that in our calculations , we do not treat the sdb phase of the white dwarf explicitly .",
    "_ ff aqr _ also displays rs cvn characteristics @xcite , and hence we can apply the same argument used for v1379 aql to ff aqr ; the secondary has a mass of approximately 1.4 m@xmath5 and so will have an insubstantial convective envelope .",

    "the zams progenitor primary must fill its roche lobe and commence the ce phase before the secondary itself evolves off the main sequence .",
    "this point is of little consequence for @xmath88 m@xmath5 as the main sequence lifetime of such secondaries will be @xmath89 gyr , which is on the order of the galactic lifetime ( and the maximum evolution time we consider ) .",
    "thus , in such cases , the progenitor primary must ascend the giant branch and fill its roche lobe within the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "we find that the least massive zams progenitor which will subsequently form a 0.47 m@xmath5 white dwarf within the lifetime of the galaxy , is 1.1 m@xmath5 .",

    "furthermore , as the long - dashed boundary for @xmath91 m@xmath5 is approximately flat , the progenitor primaries along this boundary fill their roche lobes at the same orbital period .    to see how this determines the shape of the resulting short - dashed pceb boundary for @xmath91 m@xmath5 ( labelled ` a ' in figure [ boundaries ] ) we consider equation ( [ af ] ) , which shows that for constant @xmath20 ( and hence the white dwarf mass ) , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( at the start of the ce phase ) , @xmath94 decreases for decreasing @xmath31 .",
    "hence the orbital period of the short - dashed boundary to the left of the dashed line in figure [ boundaries ] decreases for decreasing @xmath31 .    on the other hand , for @xmath95 m@xmath5 ( to the right of the dashed line in figure [ boundaries ] ) ,",
    "the main sequence lifetime of such stars is less than 10 gyr , and so the progenitor primary must increasingly compete against the secondary to evolve off the main sequence first . as a result , the zams progenitor primary star needs to be increasingly more massive for increasing secondary mass .",
    "this is reflected in the masses of the primaries at the start of the ce phase , as indicated along the long - dashed boundary in figure [ boundaries ] for @xmath96 m@xmath5 , which increase from approximately 0.9 m@xmath5 where @xmath97 m@xmath5 , to 1.8 m@xmath5 where @xmath84 m@xmath5 .    for a primary star ascending the giant branch with luminosity @xmath98",
    ", its radius on the giant branch , @xmath99 , can be modelled as @xmath100 @xcite , where @xmath101 .",
    "thus the radius of the star on the giant branch is a function of its core mass and ( weakly ) of its initial zams mass . for",
    "a given core mass , in this case of @xmath102 m@xmath5 , the corresponding value of @xmath99 will decrease for increasing mass of the zams primary .",
    "for roche lobe filling stars we have @xmath103 so the orbital period at which the ce phase will occur will decrease with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "this is shown as the slope in the long - dashed boundary in figure [ boundaries ] for @xmath96 m@xmath5 .",
    "the shape of the short - dashed boundary to the right of the dashed line in figure [ boundaries ] ( labelled ` b ' ) is a consequence of the shape of the corresponding portion of the long - dashed pre - ce boundary .",
    "furthermore , for increasing @xmath31 , while m@xmath104 remains constant , @xmath105 does increase , and so the mass of the primary giant s envelope will correspondingly increase .",

    "it has been suggested that this is the thermal and ionization energy of the giant s envelope ( han et al .",

    "1995 , dewi & tauris 2000 , webbink 2007 ) .",
    "we find that by considering this extra energy source in our models we can indeed account for the location of ik peg .",
    "however , this is a concept which has been challenged by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that , during the planetary nebula phase , the opacity of the giant s envelope decreases during recombination .",
    "hence the envelope becomes transparent to its own radiation .",
    "the radiation will therefore freely escape rather than push against the material to eject it .",
    "previous population synthesis studies have considered constant , global values of @xmath25 ( e.g. dekool 92 , willems & kolb 2004 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that this may lead to an overestimation of the binding energy of the giant s envelope , and hence underestimate the final pceb orbital period .",
    "@xcite calculated values of @xmath270 for range of masses and radii , which we incorporated into our population synthesis code .",
    "this , however , can not account for ik peg either .",
    "we note that @xcite do not calculate values of @xmath270 for @xmath271 r@xmath5 .",
    "we concede that we may still underestimate the value of @xmath270 for the case of ik peg due to our adopted extrapolation to larger radii .",
    "if we do linearly extrapolate @xmath270 for a progenitor primary of ik peg with @xmath272 m@xmath5 and @xmath273 r@xmath5 we find that @xmath274 , which is still not large enough to account for ik peg .",
    "it would therefore be beneficial to calculate @xmath24 in the mass and radius regime for pceb progenitors .    rather than consider the ce phase in terms of energy , @xcite and @xcite describe the ce phase in terms of the angular momentum of the binary .",
    "indeed , this is also a prescription favoured by @xcite .",
    "our model n15 can account for the location of ik peg .",
    "however , @xcite found that for the @xmath1-prescription , the number of pcebs increases with increasing orbital periods larger than approximately 100 d. indeed , we also find increasing number of pcebs with high mass white dwarfs with increasing orbital period , with the bulk of the population lying at approximately 1000 d. this is contrast with observations by @xcite , who found a sharp decline in the number of pcebs with increasing orbital period beyond 1 d ( however , see section 4.2 ) .",
    "even though we have critically examined a variety of treatments for the ce phase by comparing our models to the observed sample of pcebs , we have been unable to significantly constrain the underlying physics .",
    "we believe this is mainly due to the selection effects still pervading the observed sample of pcebs .",
    "the large majority of our observed pceb sample contain late type secondaries , typically m3 to m5 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that until recently pceb candidates were identified in blue colour surveys , such as the palomar green survey . as a result systems containing secondaries with early spectral types",
    "will be missed , as their optical flux will dominate over that from the white dwarf .",
    "a few exceptions include systems identified by their large proper motions ( e.g. rr cae ) or spectroscopic binaries ( e.g. v471 tau ) .",
    "ik peg was detected due to the emission of soft x - rays from the young white dwarf , which has an effective temperature of @xmath275 k.    the present sample of pcebs is therefore covering an insufficient range in secondary masses .",
    "however , matters are improving with the advent of the sdss , which probes a large @xmath276 colour space .",
    "this will allow an extra 30 pcebs to be supplemented to the currently known 46 systems in the foreseeable future ( gnsicke 2008 , private communication ) .",
    "a complementary program is currently underway to target those wd+ms systems with cool white dwarfs and/or early - type secondaries in order to compensate for the bias against such systems in the previous surveys @xcite .",
    "it is therefore feasible that we will be able to further constrain our models in the near future .",
    "the observed sample of pcebs also have @xmath243 d , which can be argued to be a further selection effect ; pcebs are also detected due to radial velocity variations of their spectra .",
    "however , @xcite found that this long - period cut - off may be a characteristic of the intrinsic pceb population , rather than a selection effect .",
    "more precisely , we have shown in section 3.7 that this may be a feature intrinsic to the population of pcebs with late - type secondaries .",
    "we also find that an imrd distribution of @xmath115 can reproduce the local space density inferred from observed pcebs by @xcite , as well as accounting for the location of the currently known sample of pcebs in @xmath277 space . however , the more generally preferred binary star imrd is @xmath38 ( e.g. duquennoy & mayor 1991 , mazeh et al .",
    "1992 , goldberg , mazeh & latham 2003 ) .",
    "by applying population synthesis techniques we have calculated the present day population of post - common envelope binaries ( pcebs ) for a range of models describing the common envelope ( ce ) phase and for different assumptions about the initial mass ratio distribution .",
    "we have then compared these models to the currently known sample of pcebs in the three - dimensional configuration space made up of the two component masses and the orbital period .",
    "we find that the canonical model of a constant , global value of @xmath268 can account for the observed pceb systems with late - type secondaries .",
    "however , this can not explain ik peg , which has an early - type secondary star .",
    "ik peg can be accounted for if we assume that the thermal and ionization energy of the giant primary s envelope , as well as the binary s orbital energy , can unbind the ce from the system .",
    "ik peg can also be explained by describing the ce phase in terms of the binary s angular momentum , according to the @xmath1-prescription proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we find that the present day number ( local space density ) of pcebs in the galaxy ranges from @xmath122 ( @xmath123 pc@xmath113 ) for model ce01 , @xmath115 , to @xmath226 ( @xmath227 pc@xmath113 ) for model n15 and for imfm2 .",
    "we also find that an initial mass ratio distribution ( imrd ) of @xmath115 gives local space densities in the range @xmath278 , in good agreement with the observationally determined local space density of @xmath279 .",
    "this form of the imrd also predicts a decline in the population of pcebs with late - type ( @xmath269 m@xmath5 ) secondaries , which is what is observed by @xcite .",
    "however , while observations show a sharp decline in the number of pcebs with orbital periods larger than 1 d , our theoretical calculations instead predict a gradual decline . we can not reproduce this sharp decline even if we take into account observational biases towards pcebs with late spectral - type secondaries , and the selection biases against pcebs with orbital periods greater than 1 d.    our work highlights that selection biases need to be overcome , especially for detecting pcebs with early - type secondaries and/or cool white dwarfs .",

    "<S> we apply population synthesis techniques to calculate the present day population of post - common envelope binaries ( pcebs ) for a range of theoretical models describing the common envelope ( ce ) phase . adopting the canonical energy budget approach </S>",
    "<S> we consider models where the ejection efficiency , @xmath0 is either a constant , or a function of the secondary mass . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the envelope binding energy from detailed stellar models of the progenitor primary , with and without the thermal and ionization energy , but we also test a commonly used analytical scaling . </S>",
    "<S> we also employ the alternative angular momentum budget approach , known as the @xmath1-algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a constant , global value of @xmath2 can adequately account for the observed population of pcebs with late spectral - type secondaries . </S>",
    "<S> however , this prescription fails to reproduce ik pegasi , which has a secondary with spectral type a8 . we can account for ik pegasi if we include thermal and ionization energy of the giant s envelope , or if we use the @xmath1-algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath1-algorithm predicts local space densities that are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude greater than estimates from observations . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the canonical energy budget prescription with an initial mass ratio distribution that favours unequal initial mass ratios ( @xmath3 ) gives a local space density which is in good agreement with observations , and best reproduces the observed distribution of pcebs . </S>",
    "<S> finally , all models fail to reproduce the sharp decline for orbital periods , @xmath4 d in the orbital period distribution of observed pcebs , even if we take into account selection effects against systems with long orbital periods and early spectral - type secondaries .    </S>",
