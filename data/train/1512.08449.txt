    "black hole is one of the most interesting predictions of general theory of relativity which has been attractive for theoretical physicists for a long time , and it has still unknown parts to study .",
    "black hole is a region of spacetime with a strong gravitational field that even light can not escape from it .",
    "it has an event horizon which its total area never decreases in any physical process @xcite . in 1992",
    "banados , teitelboim , and zanelli ( btz ) demonstrated that there is a black hole solution to ( 2 + 1)dimensional general relativity with a negative cosmological constant @xcite which it is proved that this type of black hole arises from collapsing matter @xcite . in their solution of gravitational field equation , it is required a constant curvature in local spacetime @xcite , which was a strange result as a solution of general relativity . in a certain subset of anti  de sitter ( ads ) spacetime",
    ", they found a solution which contains all the properties of black hole , by making a special identification @xcite,@xcite . also , the charged btz black hole is the analogous solution of ads ",
    "maxwell gravity in ( 2 + 1)dimension @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the btz black hole is interesting because of its connections with string theory @xcite,@xcite and its role in microscopic entropy derivations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the btz black hole can also be used in some ways to study black holes in quantum scales @xcite,@xcite . against the schwarzschild and kerr black holes",
    "the btz black hole is asymptotically anti ",
    "de sitter rather than flat which has not curvature singularity at the origin @xcite .",
    "black holes have various aspects to study",
    ". one of them that we are more interested to investigate is the gravitational effects on test particles and light which reach to spacetime of a black hole .",
    "it is important because the motion of matter and light can be used to classify an arbitrary spacetime , in order to discover its structure . for this purpose",
    ", we need to solve geodesic equations that describe the motion of particles and light .",
    "the analytical solutions for many famous spacetimes ( such as schwarzschild @xcite , four - dimensional schwarzschild - de - sitter @xcite , higher  dimensional schwarzschild , schwarzschild(anti)de sitter , reissner  nordstrom and reissner ",
    "nordstrom(anti)-de sitter @xcite , kerr @xcite , kerr  de sitter @xcite , a black hole in f(r ) gravity @xcite ) have been found previously .",
    "the solutions are given in terms of weierstrass @xmath1-functions and derivatives of kleinian sigma functions .",
    "the interesting classical and quantum properties of the black hole , have made it appropriate to have existing a lower dimensional analogue that could represent the main features without unessential complications  @xcite .",
    "moreover , ( 2 + 1)-dimensional black holes are interesting as simplifed models for analyzing conceptual issues such as black hole thermodynamics  @xcite . in addition , the study of black holes in lower dimensions is useful to better understanding the physical features ( like entropy , radiated flux ) in a black hole geometry  @xcite",
    ". also , studying the gravitational field of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional black holes and motion around these black hole , can be useful .",
    "the purpose in this paper is to determine types of particle s motion around a ( 2 + 1)dimensional charged btz black hole by studying its spacetime .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ me ] we introduce the metric and obtain geodesic equations .",

    "when @xmath10 and @xmath17 go to @xmath18 , eqs.([i]-[tmn ] ) , reduce to the field equations of black hole in einstein - maxwell gravity .",
    "it is convenient to restrict the nonlinearity parameter to @xmath19 in order to have asymptotically well - defined electric field .",
    "the metric of non rotating charged btz black hole can be written as following @xcite @xmath20 in which the metric function @xmath21 using the components of eq.([g ] ) obtains as @xcite @xmath22    this spacetime is characterized by @xmath23 ( an integration constant related to the mass ) , @xmath24 ( the electric charge of the black hole ) and cosmological constant @xmath25 . in the case of @xmath26 , one can obtain a well - known metric which is called conformally invariant maxwell solution @xcite , such as @xmath27    taking @xmath28 we have @xmath29    the metric ( [ metric ] ) is stationay and axially symmetric . to describe geodesic motion in such a spacetime we need geodesic equation which is written as @xmath30",

    "using euler  lagrange equation we can obtain constants of motion @xmath39 where @xmath40 is energy and @xmath41 is angular momentum .",
    "now , using eq.([l ] ) and eq.([constants ] ) , we can obtain geodesic equations as following @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 these equations give a complete description of dynamics . using eq.([moadele ] ) we can find effective potential @xmath45 here for convenience we define a series of dimensionless parameters as @xmath46 and then rewrite eq.([phii ] ) as @xmath47      for @xmath48 , the metric function is equal to @xmath49 , in which @xmath50 , so we have @xmath51 the solution of this equation is similar to eq.([phii ] ) ( i.e. for @xmath26 , that , it is investigated completely in this paper ) .",
