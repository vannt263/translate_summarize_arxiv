    "while active galactic nuclei ( agn ) present a variety of observational characteristics , the unified model for agn proposes the ubiquitous presence of an obscuring torus around their central engines , and that all agn are fundamentally the same @xcite .",
    "this optically and geometrically thick torus produces the effect of a line of sight viewing angle dependency .",
    "type-1 agn are observed with the direct view of fast moving material close to the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , resulting in broad emission lines in their spectra , while type-2 agn are observed from an edge - on view and the torus blocks the broad emission line region ( blr ) component from our line of sight .",
    "the most compelling evidence of the unified model was the detection of polarized broad emission lines ( pbls ) in type-2 agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "further evidence supporting the unified model comes from infrared ( ir ) observations of several type-2 agn showing the existence of obscured / hidden broad line regions ( hblrs ) detectable only with dust penetrating infrared observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    against the fact that the observations generally support the unified model",
    ", there is the question of why some , but not all , type-2 agn do not show any observational signs of pbls . @xcite and @xcite found that only 3050% of type-2 agn show pbls .",
    "some studies have advocated that the non - detection of a pbl is due to genuine lack of a blr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "others have suggested that the non - detection is due to obscuration effects , rendering the detection of pbls as difficult or impossible , even with deep near - ir ( nir ) spectro - polarimetric observations @xcite . using a statistically complete _ iras _",
    "60  @xmath4 m selected type-2 agn catalog , @xcite investigated the relationship between the detectability of pbls and ir color as an indicator of the torus inclination angle .",
    "they showed that only agn with a low torus inclination angle have high detection rate of pbls compared to those with high inclinations .",
    "this result strongly suggests that pbls could be obscured when there is an edge - on view through the torus and/or nuclear obscuration in the host galaxies .",
    "in addition to the optical spectro - polarimetry , x - ray observations suggest that there is a weak evidence showing different absorption in two types of type-2 agn .",
    "@xcite found that the agn with pbl have slightly lower column density ( @xmath5 ) than those without pbl .",
    "similarly , @xcite showed that the detection rate of pbl decreases as a function of @xmath5 , suggesting that the absorption effect by dusty torus could play a role on the detectability of pbl in agn .    to understand the role of the obscuration by the torus in type-2 agn and the detectability of pbls , knowing the torus geometry and properties is crucial .",
    "in recent years much progress has been made toward understanding the torus geometrical structure .",
    "thanks to the improvement of computing power , more physically realistic torus models assuming `` clumpy '' distributions ( called clumpy torus models ) have been coded by several authors @xcite .",
    "these models readily reproduce high spatial resolution nuclear nir to mid - ir ( mir ) spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and spectra of agn with a compact torus of @xmath6  pc radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , traditional smooth torus models @xcite had difficulties to describe the variety of nuclear seds of nearby agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . still , the true torus morphology remains far from being conclusively determined until future observations resolve the torus .",
    "both smooth and clumpy torus models have degeneracies , and from sed - fitting alone is not possible to choose one or the other ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a comparison between smooth and clumpy torus models ) .    in this paper , under the assumption that the torus follows a clumpy distribution of dust , which we consider more realistic in principle",
    ", we discuss how the precise modeled torus morphology plays a key role in the probability of the detection of pbl by fitting clumpy torus models to our series of ir seds .",
    "we use 21 high spatial resolution mir spectra in combination with nir to far - ir ( fir ) photometry , constituting one of the largest compilations of nuclear ir seds of agn in the local universe .",
    "these seds afforded by 8  m class telescopes minimize contamination of the mir torus spectra from surrounded diffuse mir emission from warm dust and/or starformation region emission , and hence we are able to construct the highest fidelity torus sed",
    ". therefore we can probe the detectability of the pbl with the least amount of host galaxy contaminations than ever before .",
    "the luminosity dependence of the torus morphology will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ( ichikawa  et  al .  in  prep . ) .",

    "the scattering region ( shown schematically as a filled green bar ) can be larger due to the larger opening angle of the torus , allowing more photons to be scattered , and hence polarized , from the blr .",

    ", we produced a toy polarization model assuming that the scattering region is a two dimensional biconical structure centered to the central engine .",
    "then , we measure the degree of polarization and polarized flux , and found that the measured polarized flux is larger for hblr than those for nhblr , supporting our results .",

    "this is also in agreement with the larger value of @xmath396  @xmath397 estimated from x - ray observations of the nhblr objects in our sample .    to summarize , as shown in the bottom panel of figure  4 , the chance to observe scattered ( polarized ) flux from the blr",
    "is reduced by the double effect of ( a ) less scattering of the flux from the blr ( due to the reduced scattering area ) and ( b ) more obscuration between the observer and the scattering region .",
    "therefore , the classification of an agn as hblr or nhblr is probabilistic , and it would depend on the intrinsic properties of the torus , in particular of @xmath147 .",
    "this could be a reasonable explanation for the lack of a hidden ( polarized ) blr in some type-2 objects40% of type-2 objects , based on the distribution of dust within the torus and its inclination being not as simple as predicted by the unified model , was shown in the talk by c. ramos almeida at the polarization & active galactic nuclei workshop held 2012 october 16 - 17 at the royal observatory of belgium . ] .",
    "however , we note that the classification of the galaxies as hblr and nhblr is mainly based on spectropolarimetric observations from 34 m telescopes , and some of the nhblr could be then misclassified . therefore , further higher sensitivity spectropolarimetry observations of nhblr agn with 8  m class telescopes such as subaru / focas and/or vlt / fors2 are highly encouraged to search for the hblr in those agn ( ramos almeida et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the dependence of hblr detection in type-2 agn on torus inclination angle is still a matter of debate .",
    "this idea arises from the observational trend that the _ iras _ 60  @xmath4 m to 25  @xmath4 m color ratio ( @xmath410 ) of hblr agn is @xmath407 on average while that of nhblr agn is @xmath408 @xcite .",
    "several authors have suggested that this trend is due to the inclination angle of the torus : the cooler and outer dust within the torus blocks the warm and inner hot dust for edge - on views , producing the high @xmath410 , while the warm inner dust can be seen from the face - on views , reducing the value of @xmath410 .",
    "following this idea , type-2 agn with low @xmath410 would tend to be detected as hblr agn due to the more face - on view of the torus and vice versa .",
    "here we can take advantage of the torus models fitted to our seds , which are available for each agn and shown in figure  1 .",
    "the wavelength range covered by the models allows us to calculate @xmath410 color ratios for each source .",
    "we have also compiled @xmath410 color ratios from _ iras _ for comparison , which probe much larger scales than our torus seds .",
    "out of 21 sources , we obtained 17 _ iras _",
    "@xmath410 colors with good quality of fluxes ( @xmath411 , which is the highest quality ) . ] .",
    "figure  5 shows the relationship between the @xmath410 flux ratios obtained from _ iras _ and those from the torus model seds .",
    "the averages _ iras _ @xmath410 flux ratio for type-1 , hblr , and nhblr agn are @xmath412 , @xmath413 and @xmath414 , respectively , showing the previously mentioned correlation for hblr and nhblr agn , although with large error bars .",
    "however , when we compare the values obtained from the torus model seds , which exclude contamination from the host galaxy , we find that they are very similar for the three groups and smaller than the _ iras _ colors ( @xmath410 = @xmath415 , @xmath416 , and @xmath417 for type-1 , hblr , and nhblr agn respectively ) .",
    "these results show that the differences of _ iras _",
    "@xmath410 among the three subgroups are not produced from the torus dust .",
    "a similar result was reported by @xcite , but using x - ray observations .",
    "although the standard deviations of the average values of the _ iras _ colors are large for the three subgroups , one possible explanation for the cooler _ iras _ colors of nhblr in comparison with those of hblr agn could be dust emission from stronger starbursts in their host galaxies .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous results showing that highly obscured agn tend to have higher star formation activity in their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , larger obscuration from the torus in nhblr agn ( as shown in figure  4 ) and higher star formation activity in the host galaxy could be somehow coupled .",
    "for example , using three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations , @xcite showed that starbursts and supernovae within the central 100  pc of host galaxies help lifting up the torus , suggesting that high star formation activity could influence the scale height of the torus . comparing the nuclear and overall star formation activity of agn with the torus obscuration is crucial to find out if they are coupled ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "3 .   combining @xmath410 colors obtained from _ iras _ photometry and from torus model seds , we showed that the low @xmath410 measured fof hblr using _ iras _ data are not due to a more face - on inclination of torus , but rather to star formation activity in their host galaxies .",
