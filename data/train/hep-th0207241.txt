    "in the standard picture of the ads / cft correspondence the closed string states in the bulk of @xmath7 are dual ( at large @xmath8 ) to the ( single - trace ) operators in the @xmath0 sym cft . recently , there was a progress in understanding details of this correspondence in certain sectors of string states with large ( angular momentum ) quantum numbers @xcite .    adding a d3-brane probe located parallel ( and",
    "close ) to the boundary introduces open string sectors  open strings attached to the d3-brane .",

    "it is natural to associate such open strings with wilson loops that depend on scalar fields in a non - trivial way .",
    "here we shall study the dependence of the wilson loops on a new parameter @xmath2 corresponding to rotation of the open string configuration along big circle of @xmath1 . while the corresponding wilson loop will not carry a definite r - charge and thus there will be no direct relation to the closed string case of , we are motivated by the hope that an investigation of more general scalar wilson loops may be useful for better understanding of the ads / cft duality . in particular , one may be able to identify new cases where certain features of sym observables can be interpolated from weak to strong t hooft coupling .",
    "the _ minkowski_-signature wilson loops depending not only on a contour @xmath9 in minkowski space @xmath10 but also on a contour @xmath11 in @xmath1 can be related to a propagator of a `` w - boson '' present in the case of a generic slowly varying scalar field condensate ( with @xmath12 being a unit 6-vector in the direction of the symmetry breaking condensate ) @xmath13.\\ ] ] similar generalizations of constant scalar wilson loops ( @xmath14 ) were considered early on in the context of ads / cft correspondence @xcite and were recently shown to admit new interesting cases in which supersymmetry is partially preserved .",

    "for instance , if we change @xmath23 to @xmath24 in the wilson loop ( [ wils ] ) , we should also substitute @xmath25 for @xmath2 .",
    "the euclidean counterpart of the wilson line with rotation in @xmath1 is @xmath26\\ , \\ ] ] where we introduced the complex scalar field @xmath27 .",
    "our aim will be to compare the weak - coupling ( i.e. perturbative sym ) and strong - coupling ( i.e. semiclassical string theory in ) predictions for the expectation values of such wilson loops , generalizing the previously known results for the single straight line and the antiparallel lines to the case of @xmath28 .",
    "while in the @xmath29 case the expressions for the minkowski and euclidean signature loops are directly related , we shall find that the two are different in the rotating case . while on the ads side",
    "the minkowski case may seem natural having a direct open - string energy interpretation , the corresponding perturbative sym potential turns out to be imaginary ( section 2.1 ) . the latter is found to be a direct analytic continuation @xmath30 of the well - defined real potential extracted from the euclidean wilson loop expectation value ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "this may be considered as an indication that non - constant scalar wilson loops should be associated with euclidean minimal surfaces on the string side .    for @xmath29 ,",
    "the simplest 1/2 supersymmetric configuration ( `` straight line '' ) corresponds to a single w - boson at rest , i.e. to the @xmath31 line at the boundary of @xmath7 which may be thought of as the end - line of the open string stretched from the horizon @xmath32 to the boundary @xmath33 .",
    "below we shall first determine how this simplest classical open - string solution is modified in the rotating case .",
    "in the minkowski case ( section 2.2 ) we shall find that instead of running all the way to the horizon , the string reaches some maximal height @xmath34 and then returns back to the same point at the boundary .",
    "in the euclidean case ( section 3.2 ) the classical string solution is still similar to the @xmath29 case : the infinite line along the radial ads direction .",
    "a novel feature is an instability , which leads to shrinking of the minimal surface in @xmath1 .",
    "we shall then generalize the minimal surface solution of describing the potential between two w - bosons ( i.e. the minimal surface ending on two anti - parallel lines on the boundary separated by distance @xmath35 ) to the case with an extra `` @xmath1-rotation '' characterized by the parameter @xmath2 . in general , the potential will have the structure @xmath36 i.e. will be a non - trivial function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath37 and the t hooft coupling @xmath38 ( we assume @xmath39 ) . at weak coupling ,",
    "i.e. in the sym perturbation theory @xmath40 at strong coupling , i.e. in the semiclassical string theory in one finds that @xmath41 the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 will be determined below .",
    "we shall find that in the minkowski case ( section 2.2 ) the classical string solution no longer exists if @xmath44 is larger than certain critical value @xmath45 . in the euclidean case ( section 3.2 ) , the minimal surface exists for any value of @xmath46 but there is a phase transition at @xmath47 , which is similar to the gross - ooguri transition @xcite , though the mechanism of the transition is different . in our case",
    ", the phase transition happens due to the onset of an instability for the minimal surface rotating in @xmath1 , while the gross - ooguri phase transition is caused by the string breaking .",
    "the potential is a non - analytic function of the distance , but it has the same coulomb - law ( @xmath48 ) asymptotics both at short and at large distances with the same effective charge .",
    "the expectation value of the wilson loop ( [ wils ] ) is given , to the first order in perturbation theory in @xmath49 , by : and the standard pole prescription for propagators . ]",
    "@xmath50 here , @xmath51 is the length of the loop ( @xmath52 ) , which serves as an ir cutoff .",
    "computing the integrals over @xmath53 and over @xmath23 , we get : @xmath54 now , @xmath55 and @xmath56 the only non - zero contribution comes from the pole at @xmath57 : @xmath58 this result can be obtained from the euclidean expectation value found in section 3.1 by the substitution @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "usually , the exponent in the wilson line vev is interpreted as a response of the vacuum energy to the insertion of an external source .",
    "one would then expect an oscillating behavior of the expectation value : @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the energy which the source acquires due to interactions with the yang - mills fields . instead of oscillations , we found an exponential decrease , which , according to the standard lore , is a signal of an instability .",
    "one way to understand this instability is to recall that wilson line with time dependence in @xmath1 describes an infinitely heavy w - boson associated with non - constant higgs condensate .",
    "time dependence of the condensate allows the wilson loop to emit on - shell scalars . as a result ,",
    "the pole of the scalar propagator lies in the region of integration in the one - loop amplitude , and the amplitude acquires an imaginary part from the residue .",
    "the potential @xmath63 is defined by the expectation value of the rectangular loop whose time extent is much larger than the spatial separation ( @xmath64 ) : @xmath65 to the first order in perturbation theory : @xmath66 after angular and energy integrations we get @xmath67 again , there is a resonant term and the potential picks up an imaginary part from the pole at @xmath57 : @xmath68 this expression also turns out to be an analytic continuation in @xmath2 of the corresponding euclidean potential found in section 3.1 .",
    "this suggests that in general the expectation values of the minkowski wilson loops can be obtained by an analytic continuation from the euclidean space . as follows from the above expression ,",
    "the continuation in the leading - order perturbative expression is non - trivial and produces imaginary parts in the expectation values .",
    "almost certainly , continuation from euclidean space should work to all orders of perturbation theory , though it would be interesting to check this by pushing perturbative calculations to higher orders as it was done for the wilson loops which are static in @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a natural guess then is that well - defined euclidean wilson loops are associated with the euclidean minimal surfaces at strong coupling .    before turning to the euclidean case in section 3 , in the remainder of this section we shall consider the minkowski - signature open strings which end at the boundary of @xmath7 .",
    "it seems that these string solutions are not directly related to wilson loops , but may be interesting on their own .",

    "one may restrict @xmath87 to run from @xmath88 to @xmath89 , so that the string has only one fold ( multi - folded strings will have bigger energy ) .",
    "this open - string configuration is characterized by the values of the conserved charges  the space - time energy and the angular momentum @xmath90 where we added factors of 2 as the integral goes from 0 to the folding point .",
    "not surprisingly , the value of the angular momentum does not depend on @xmath2 ( @xmath91 is dimensionless , @xmath2 has a dimension of mass ) : @xmath92 the expression for the energy is divergent at @xmath93 and can be defined by subtracting , as in the @xmath29 case , the value of the infinite straight string configuration .",
    "note that we have to subtract the straight - line contribution twice as the two segments of the folded string include the singular point @xmath33 .",
    "then the subtracted value of the energy is @xmath94 thus the subtracted energy vanishes as in the non - rotating case , despite the fact that the @xmath28 solution is no longer supersymmetric .",

    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the rotation in @xmath1 effectively gives mass to the azimuthal fluctuations of the string : @xmath180 in ( [ act ] ) .",
    "since the mass - squared is negative , the solution with @xmath101 is clearly unstable .",
    "however , for a sufficiently short string , this instability has no time to develop .    to see this ,",
    "let us analyze the equation of motion for the azimuthal angle : @xmath181 this is the newton s equation for a pendulum . as the string propagates from one wilson line to another , the azimuthal angle changes from @xmath182 to @xmath183 , and then bounces back to @xmath182 , so the pendulum makes one half of the oscillation .",
    "the total period of oscillation is equal to @xmath184 , twice the internal length of the string .",
    "the period depends on the energy : it is bigger for larger energy .",

    ", the string becomes long enough to support the motion in the azimuthal direction and then the non - trivial solution takes over . as a consequence , the area and the potential",
    "are continuous , but non - analytic functions of the distance .",
    "there is a transition from one solution to another which leads to non - analyticity of the potential . in a similar context , the non - analyticity ( gross - ooguri phase transition @xcite )",
    "occurs due to the string breaking . here",

    "the areas of the solutions a and b are equal at the critical point , so the transition is of the second order here : the area is continuous together with its first derivative .",
    "it is easy to analyze the potential in the two limiting cases of small and large distances :    * short distances : @xmath193 *      * long distances : @xmath200 *",
    "we have studied open string solutions which involve rotation in @xmath1 with a constant frequency . in the sym theory , these solutions are naturally associated with wilson loops whose coupling to scalars corresponds to rotation in a plane in internal 6-dimensional space .",
    "unexpectedly , we found that minkowskian and euclidean solutions are absolutely different and can not be obtained from each other by analytic continuation .    on the other hand , for the perturbative sym expectation values of the wilson loops the analytic continuation does work , though time dependence of the scalars ( @xmath1 coordinates ) makes wick rotation quite subtle .",
    "after continuation from euclidean to minkowski space , vev s of rotating wilson loops become complex - valued .",
    "this presents a serious obstacle for their stringy interpretation directly in minkowski - signature @xmath203 space .",
    "it seems likely that the duality between wilson loops and open strings is well - defined only in the euclidean version of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the role of the classical solutions for the open strings in the minkowski case described in section 2.2 is unclear to us .",
    "it would be very interesting to clarify their meaning and to understand what do they correspond to on the gauge theory side of the ads / cft duality .",
    "one of the lessons of this work is that there seems to be no direct relation between the open and closed string states with rotation in @xmath1 .",
    "this is probably related to the fact there is no sense in which a wilson loop can carry a definite r - charge .",
    "indeed , a generic wilson loop is a mixture of states with various r - charges  its local expansion contains operators of different r - charges @xcite . perhaps , a study of the ope coefficients @xcite for operators with large r - charge may help to establish a contact between the semiclassical string picture of @xcite and the wilson loops .",
