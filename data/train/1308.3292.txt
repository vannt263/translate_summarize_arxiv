    "galaxies grow both by merging and by fresh gas accretion .",
    "hierarchical models that follow the merger histories of galaxies and their host dark matter halos successfully explain the large - scale structure of the universe , yet these models have difficulty reproducing the relative abundance of disk - dominated vs.  bulge - dominated galaxies across a broad range of environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , gas - rich mergers are much less destructive and may even help to build disks .",
    "such mergers are expected to predominate at low galaxy masses and/or early epochs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fresh gas accretion may also rebuild disks in low - mass e / s0 merger remnants , potentially restoring late - type morphologies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "observations point to significant cold gas accretion onto galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . moreover , the dynamics of halo gas suggest that this gas can in principle provide the angular momentum needed for the rapid growth of disks @xcite .",
    "cosmological hydro simulations show large - scale `` cold '' ( @xmath110@xmath9@xmath10k ) gas flows that travel along the filaments and walls of the cosmic web ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observational signs of such flows have indeed been found ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is not yet clear to what extent these flows remain cold or shock - heat upon halo entry ( compare @xcite vs.  @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these details may affect angular momentum delivery as well as the onset of rapid accretion , which typically occurs when the cooling radius exceeds the virial radius , below a characteristic mass scale that depends on the model @xcite .",
    "regardless of these specifics , it is a general feature of recent models that cosmic gas accretion accounts for a larger percentage of galaxy growth in low - mass halos than can be attributed to merging .",
    "thus the physics of accretion can dramatically change the balance of bulges and disks within the hierarchical merging paradigm .",
    "clearly mass - dependent gas physics affects patterns of growth by both mergers and accretion , and transitions in gas physics may lie at the heart of understanding the disky morphologies and overall growth histories of galaxies .",
    "two galaxy mass scales have been previously noted as important transition points in morphology , gas richness ( defined as gas - to - stellar mass ratio in this paper ) , and star formation history : the `` bimodality scale '' and the `` gas - richness threshold scale . ''",
    "the bimodality scale is typically identified with stellar mass @xmath11 , which corresponds to rotation velocity @xmath4  ( see  [ sec : disting ] herein ) .",
    "this scale marks the crossover point in relative abundance of young disk - dominated vs.  old spheroid - dominated stellar populations @xcite .",
    "as traced by late - type vs.  early - type morphology , this transition appears to shift downward in mass over cosmic time @xcite .",
    "equivalently , the bimodality scale marks a shift in the relative number density of galaxies on the red and blue sequences in @xmath12 color vs.  stellar mass @xmath13 parameter space @xcite , which are associated with `` red and dead '' galaxies that have a strong 4000  break and blue star - forming systems , respectively .",
    "agn activity in early - type galaxies peaks up just below the bimodality scale in a population that may be evolving toward the red sequence , suggesting black hole growth in tandem with spheroid formation @xcite .",
    "the slope of the gas - phase metallicity vs.  @xmath13 relation flattens above the bimodality scale , indicating changes in the interplay of gas cooling / infall , gas consumption , and gas loss in metal - enriched outflows @xcite .",
    "hot gas halos become common above the bimodality scale ( * ? ? ?",
    "* translating their @xmath14-band magnitudes to equivalent stellar masses ) , potentially enhancing the efficacy of agn feedback @xcite .    a second , lower - mass transition scale was previously highlighted by @xcite , in a scenario explaining low - metallicity diffuse dwarf galaxies as the result of global gas loss caused by supernova winds acting in the shallow potential wells of @xmath15  dark matter halos .",
    "more recent work has shown that such `` blowaway '' ( as distinct from local `` blowout '' ) should occur only in much smaller halos , near @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "blowaway near @xmath17  would be in any case hard to reconcile with the fact that `` high - mass dwarf '' galaxies are typically gas rich rather than gas poor ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k04 ) .",
    "in fact gas- _ dominated _ galaxies become typical of the blue sequence below @xmath18  ( corresponding to @xmath3 ;  [ sec : disting ] herein ) , as gas fractions rise on both sequences ( k04 ; @xcite , hereafter kgb ) .",
    "we therefore refer to the @xmath3  scale as the `` gas - richness threshold scale , '' following kgb .",
    "calculations by @xcite suggest that an increase in gas richness is essential to explain changes in metallicity at the threshold scale ( specifically , the drop in effective yields below @xmath3  reported by @xcite ) , and that a second essential ingredient is low star formation efficiency ( in the sense of star formation rate divided by gas mass ; we will revisit this concept in relation to cosmic accretion in  [ sec : accdom ] ) .",
    "in a separate study of edge - on , `` bulgeless '' disk galaxies , @xcite reported another , presumably related change in interstellar medium ( ism ) physics at the threshold scale : thin , concentrated dust lanes emerge abruptly above @xmath19 . moreover , despite the authors best efforts to select for bulgeless morphology , in practice their high - quality follow - up imaging reveals a small `` three - dimensional '' bulge in every sample galaxy above @xmath19 , suggesting a link between changes in gas physics and galaxy structure .",
    "the onset of inevitable bulges above the threshold scale ( also seen by @xcite ) occurs simultaneously with a sharp _ decline _ in the population of `` blue - sequence e / s0s , '' identified by kgb as gas - rich merger remnants rebuilding disks ( although higher - mass blue e / s0s are more often quenching , especially above the bimodality scale ; @xcite ; kgb ) .",
    "@xcite report transitions in bulge demographics at both the threshold and bimodality scales , with bulgeless galaxies dominant below @xmath20 , pseudobulges dominant between @xmath21@xmath22 , and classical bulges / elliptical galaxies dominant above @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly , the e / s0 mass  radius relation bifurcates into two loci below the threshold scale ( e.g. , kgb ; @xcite ) .    given the variety of physical processes and galaxy properties changing at the threshold and bimodality scales , these closely spaced mass scales have been conflated by multiple authors , including k04 and @xcite , and the blurring of the two has been further exacerbated by systematic differences in stellar mass zero points between investigators ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet appreciating the distinction between the threshold and bimodality scales is of key interest , since we will demonstrate herein that only in the narrow mass range between the threshold and bimodality scales do galaxies like our milky way  intermediate between gas - dominated bulgeless disks and gas - starved spheroids  become typical in the galaxy population .",
    "an exploration of the transitions occurring at the threshold and bimodality scales may therefore shed light on our galaxy s past and future .    in what follows",
    "we employ multi - wavelength data from two complementary samples described in  [ sec : data ] to explore structural and gas richness ( @xmath7 ) transitions across the threshold and bimodality scales in  [ sec : disting ] .",
    "we show that notwithstanding these notable transitions , there is far greater scatter in @xmath6 vs.  galaxy mass than has been previously appreciated .",
    "in contrast , we demonstrate in  [ sec : regimes ] that @xmath7 correlates in a surprisingly one - to - one fashion with a quantity we refer to as the `` long - term fractional stellar mass growth rate '' ( fsmgr@xmath23 ) , which considers star formation integrated over the last gyr and is defined such that it can exceed one over the unit of time , unlike a specific star formation rate .",
    "we argue that the fsmgr@xmath23@xmath7 correlation , and not the kennicutt - schmidt law , underlies the tight observed relation between @xmath7 and ultraviolet / blue minus near - infrared colors ( hereafter , `` u@xmath24nir '' colors ) previously reported by k04 .",
    "moreover , we propose that coordinated changes in morphology and gas richness as a function of fsmgr@xmath23 can be usefully understood in terms of changes in cosmic accretion and internal gas processing between three `` refueling regimes '' : accretion - dominated , processing - dominated , and quenched .",
    "finally , we tie our results back to the threshold and bimodality scales , showing that these scales represent transitions in the relative numerical dominance of galaxies in the three regimes , likely tied to the halo mass dependence of cosmic accretion .",
    "our results suggest a reevaluation of dwarf galaxies as not `` inefficient '' gas consumers but `` overwhelmed '' gas accretors , and of moderately gas - rich bulged disks like our milky way as not `` normal '' but `` transitional '' in the galaxy population .",
    "our analysis relies on two samples .",
    "the highest quality hi data , multi - band photometry , and kinematic data come from the nearby field galaxy survey ( nfgs , @xcite ) , a broadly representative sample of @xmath1200 galaxies spanning stellar masses @xmath25@xmath26  and all morphologies .",
    "better statistics are offered by a volume - limited sample of @xmath13000 galaxies , hereafter the `` v3000 '' sample , with flux - limited hi data and partial kinematic information from the blind 21 cm arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa , * ? ? ?",

    "we detail new and reprocessed archival data for the nfgs and v3000 samples below .",
    "we assume @xmath27  and @xmath28 throughout this work .",
    "neglecting @xmath29 introduces negligible errors at the low redshifts of our sample galaxies .",
    "the nfgs was drawn from a @xmath30-selected parent survey , the cfa  1 redshift survey @xcite , in approximate proportion to the luminosity function , and it preserves the cfa  1 survey s relative frequency of morphological types at each luminosity @xcite .",
    "the 196 galaxies in the nfgs obey an artificial luminosity - distance correlation imposed to ensure that their apparent diameters do not vary too much , as an observational convenience .",
    "thus large - scale environments are not uniformly sampled as a function of luminosity , although a wide variety of environments are represented ranging from underdense regions to the coma cluster .",
    "our analysis makes use of 190/196 galaxies in the nfgs , after rejection of six objects with nearly point source morphology due to powerful agn or in one case a superposed star .",

    "[ fg : nfgscolmasstype]a are reliable but not perfect , due to the inclination - blind selection of the nfgs as well as the fact that when the galaxies were classified , @xcite allowed fairly large discrepancies between different classifiers to remain unresolved .",

    "our sdss magnitudes are measured using the newly optimized background sky estimates provided with all dr8 images ( though not actually incorporated in dr8 catalog photometry ) , as described in @xcite .",
    "the extended sky coverage of dr8 includes 177 of our 190 galaxies . for _ galex",

    "the resulting magnitudes are in good agreement with those from @xcite , who applied a similar background subtraction technique , with typical differences of @xmath10.04 magnitudes . in turn , our 2mass pipeline incorporates background subtraction methods optimized with reference to the irac imaging , which includes deep s4 g imaging of dwarf galaxies . with this careful background subtraction and the imposition of ellipses determined from the optical profile fits ( using the pas and ellipticities from @xcite for the 13 galaxies lacking sdss data ) , we have found it possible to compute reliable _ jhk _ magnitudes for the entire sample , albeit sometimes with large error bars . as in the optical , we use multiple extrapolation techniques to estimate systematic errors in the nir , although we find a curve of growth approach is generally most robust , especially for shallow 2mass data ( see @xcite , hereafter s13 , for further details on our nir pipelines ) .",

    "[ fg : nfgscolmasstype ] is @xmath10.2  mag bluer than in previous studies using sdss catalog data .",
    "however , the same figure shows that our colors are in close agreement with those determined by @xcite .",
    "we attribute about half of the offset between our @xmath12 colors and those from the sdss catalog to the improved sky subtraction of @xcite , who demonstrate that their new protocol will yield @xmath10.1  mag bluer colors for galaxies with @xmath34 ( marked in fig .",
    "[ fg : coltf ] ) .",
    "however , we measure greater color differences than expected from the new sky subtraction alone . some discrepancies certainly reflect catastrophic failures of the sdss pipeline ( a few so extreme they lie outside the plot boundaries ) , but some likely also reflect the fact that we ( like @xcite ) measure magnitudes by methods that permit color gradients , whereas the sdss model magnitude algorithm enforces a common profile in all bands , which is determined in the @xmath35 band . in the case of massive early type galaxies , for which the centers are redder than the outskirts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sdss model magnitude methodology would be expected to produce an `` overly red '' red sequence .",
    "stellar masses and other stellar population parameters are estimated using a variant of the code described in @xcite and improved by kgb , which simultaneously fits both the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and the integrated spectrum ( if available ) of a galaxy with a suite of composite stellar population models .",
    "the code combines old+young simple stellar populations ( ssps ) from @xcite in a grid of models with varying age , metallicity , and percentage of young stars .",
    "the models allow for 11 different extinction / reddening values ( @xmath36 = 0 , 0.12 , 0.24 ... 1.2 ) applied to the young ssp using the @xcite dust law .",
    "likelihoods and stellar masses are computed for all models in the grid , and the median of the likelihood - weighted stellar mass distribution provides the most robust final stellar mass estimate , with uncertainties determined from the 68% confidence interval around the median .    in the present work we consider two different model grids .",
    "the first , also used by s13 , assumes a `` diet '' salpeter imf @xcite .",
    "it combines an old ssp ( age 1.4 , 2.5 , 3.5 , 4.5 ... 13.5  gyr ) with a young ssp ( age 5 , 25 , 100 , 290 , or 1000 myr ) , with the younger component contributing 0% , 1% , 2% , 4% , 8% , 16% , 32% , or 64% of the mass .",
    "this grid differs from that of kgb only in adding a young population age of 5 myr .",
    "we note also that although not stated explicitly in kgb , the code _ does _ allow a `` middle - aged '' young population , i.e. , one with any of the `` old '' ages younger than the designated old population age ( for example , 2.5  gyr combined with 13.5  gyr ) .",
    "we compensate for the overrepresentation of @xmath81  gyr ssps in old+young pairings by downweighting the likelihoods for these pairings such that all @xmath81  gyr ssps together have equal weight to one `` middle - aged '' population option , approximating a uniform prior on the age of the younger component .",
    "following kgb , this model set includes three metallicities @xmath37 = 0.008 , 0.02 , and 0.05 ( solar/2.5 , solar , and solar@xmath382.5 ) .",
    "the second model grid is our primary one for the present work .",
    "it is designed to enable estimation of the ratio of stellar mass formed within the last gyr to preexisting stellar mass ( where this ratio equals the long - term fractional stellar mass growth rate , fsmgr@xmath39 ) and therefore includes both single - burst and continuous star formation history ( sfh ) options for the young population . to facilitate comparison with the work of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s07 ) in  [ sec : ukssfr ] , our model grid emulates theirs in including an additional low metallicity choice ( @xmath37 = 0.004 ) and adopting a chabrier imf .",
    "we further consider that even continuous star formation can be bursty on @xmath1200  myr timescales ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which s07 choose to model with superposition of random bursts . to keep the grid size manageable , since only the most recent bursts are likely to strongly affect the model fits , we take the alternate approach of constructing a set of young population models that have constant star formation running from 1015  myr ago to a turn - off point sometime between 0 to 195  myr ago , sampled every 15  myr .",
    "the young population options also include five models representing quenching bursts without subsequent star formation : ssps with ages 360 , 509 , 641 , 806 , and 1015  myr .",
    "for computational convenience , we restrict the old ssp choices in this model grid to six ages ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 12  gyr ) . however , we now consider 13 young stellar population mass fractions ( 0.001 , 0.002 , 0.005 , 0.011 , 0.025 , 0.053 , 0.112 , 0.220 , 0.387 , 0.585 , 0.760 , 0.876 , 0.941 ) , equally spaced logarithmically in fsmgr@xmath23 . once again , an old ssp can serve as the younger model in an old+young pair , and fsmgr@xmath23 @xmath40 0 in such a case .",
    "the overrepresentation of pairings with young age @xmath81  gyr is approximately cancelled by downweighting the likelihoods for these models , where we treat all of the continuous sfh models together as having combined weight equal to one of the five @xmath81  gyr bursts , then further downweight both types of young models relative to the `` middle - aged '' ssps to approximate a uniform prior on the age of the younger component .",
    "as data are available , we simultaneously fit these model grids to nuv+_ugrizjhk_+irac 3.6@xmath31 m seds as well as optical spectroscopy .",
    "we apply the 0.04  mag ab offset for the @xmath41 band inside the code . to the individual magnitude errors we add extra photometric uncertainties to account for variations between methods of foreground extinction correction and sky level estimation ; 0.1  mag in the nuv , 0.05  mag in @xmath41 , 0.03  mag in @xmath42 , and 0.1  mag in @xmath43+irac 3.6@xmath31 m , with an extra 0.1  mag in @xmath43 for faint blue galaxies ( @xmath44 or @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 or @xmath49 ) .",
    "these choices are motivated by the analyses of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , as well as our own analysis of the agreement of our @xmath43 magnitudes with the best fits .",
    "when sdss data are unavailable , we substitute the _ ubr _ magnitudes from @xcite , applying a uniform 0.2  mag offset to reconcile the @xmath50 zero points with our brighter sdss magnitudes , where this offset value is estimated by fitting both @xmath51 and @xmath50 simultaneously when possible in an initial round of sed fits .",
    "our final fits do not include _ ubr _ when we have _ ugriz _ however , to minimize systematics .",
    "we note that our estimated across - the - board @xmath10.2  mag offset is opposite to the vega - to - ab offset for the @xmath52 band and thus yields fortuitous zero point agreement between the @xmath35 and @xmath52 bands ( as seen for example by comparing the merged nfgs tully - fisher / faber - jackson relations shown in fig .",

    "we would propose that the paradox arises from the fact that the english words `` low efficiency '' connote galaxies lazily consuming gas : if instead the gas is pouring in faster than even the highest - ssfr galaxies can possibly consume it , such galaxies might be better termed `` overwhelmed '' than `` inefficient . ''      for galaxies in the processing - dominated regime , gas",

    "whose halos are experiencing reduced cosmic accretion , the transition to a processing - dominated state may be self - reinforcing . slowed dilution of the ism with fresh gas and/or reduced metal loss in outflows may lead to more efficient h@xmath89 formation on dust grains @xcite .",
    "this process may in turn increase consumption efficiency for the diminished infalling gas and accelerate the galaxy s evolution to a processing - dominated state ( thus decelerating growth ) .",
    "in addition , mild quenching may encourage more prominent stellar bulges and more concentrated disks that further promote higher gas densities and more efficient star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "notably , galaxies in the processing - dominated regime show deviations in @xmath140 that seem to correlate with high h@xmath89/hi , based on the incomplete h@xmath89 data available ( fig .  [ fg : ssfrcheck ] ) .",
    "our previous analysis of nfgs galaxies has revealed bursty , correlated variations in central and outer disk colors and h@xmath89/hi ratios , particularly for bulged disks ( s13 ) .",
    "these variations seem to reflect externally triggered gas inflow events and central star formation enhancements , with corresponding lulls in outer - disk growth ( @xcite ; s13 ) .",
    "the most extreme events lead to formation of blue - sequence e / s0s , which account for many of the spheroid - dominated galaxies embedded in the main fsmgr@xmath142@xmath140 locus in fig .",
    "[ fg : ssfrcheck ] . based on a variety of evidence , including identification of temporal sequences in a `` fueling diagram '' linking stellar populations and gas content ,",
    "we have argued elsewhere that blue - sequence e / s0s reflect a process of gas - rich merger - induced bulge building followed by disk regrowth , which may play a crucial role in the morphological evolution of disk galaxies ( kgb ; w10a ; @xcite ; s13 ) .",
    "other authors have also documented a `` living '' population of e / s0s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in the mass regime below the threshold scale , blue - sequence e / s0s overlap with bcds , suggesting a continuity of phenomena ; such galaxies are most common below the threshold scale , with a tapering population up to the bimodality scale .",
    "while bursty star formation has traditionally been ascribed to dwarf galaxies , @xcite demonstrate that stochastic star formation is in fact most prevalent for galaxies with the intermediate masses and surface mass densities of bulged spirals ( which happen to coincide with those of blue - sequence e / s0s ; kgb ) . from a comparison to semi - analytic models , these authors infer that the observed stochasticity reflects efficient processing of fresh gas infall .",
    "@xcite advance similar ideas in their analysis of intermediate - redshift galaxies , concluding that efficient , short - lived bursts are typical for galaxy rotation velocities @xmath184 .",
    "these authors bursty accretion picture is roughly consistent with ours , with the caveat that we emphasize the roles of not only cosmic infall but also gas processing mechanisms in refueling .",

    "[ fg : goversv]a is ugc  9562 , a polar ring galaxy for which the misalignment of fresh accretion relative to the inner bulge / disk orientation likely inhibits normal gas transport , creating a system hovering between the accretion - dominated and processing - dominated regimes .    both externally driven and secular gas inflow mechanisms should become more important above the threshold scale .",
    "@xcite perform an analytic timescale analysis comparing growth by cosmic accretion , merging , and secular disk evolution as a function of galaxy mass at @xmath0 .",
    "they find that although merger rates are insignificant compared to gas accretion rates for @xmath18710@xmath188 , the two become comparable at intermediate masses , as the merger rate ( per gyr ) increases with galaxy mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , significant growth largely uncorrelated with cosmic gas accretion may be possible via intermittent satellite mergers , which might rejuvenate the galaxy either by briefly fueling star formation or by injecting stellar mass formed relatively recently in the satellite @xcite .",
    "for spheroid - dominated galaxies , @xcite argue that `` morphological quenching '' inhibits the gas processing necessary to form stars , and indeed , the most massive ( @xmath192 ) early - type galaxies seem to lack recent star formation regardless of gas content @xcite .",
    "consistent with this idea , we see two degrees of quenching in fig .  [ fg : ujmorph]a , with a distinct population of _ nearly _ quenched bulged disks forming a peak just blueward of the red - and - dead peak for spheroid - dominated galaxies .",
    "arguably , these systems represent the extreme tail of the processing - dominated regime , appearing as dying spirals or slightly blue s0s .",

    "our analysis has made use of two samples , both broadly representative of the general galaxy population down to the `` high - mass dwarf '' regime ( baryonic masses @xmath110@xmath193 ) .",
    "these samples span a wide range of void to cluster environments , with non - cluster galaxies naturally predominant .",
    "the nfgs comprises @xmath1200 galaxies with newly complete hi data , partial co data , and internal kinematic data homogenized from a mix of stellar , ionized gas , and neutral gas measurements .",
    "the nfgs hi database is uniquely powerful in providing detections or strong upper limits ( @xmath194 ) for all galaxies .",
    "the v3000 sample comprises @xmath13000 galaxies in a volume - limited union of the sdss survey and the blind 21 cm alfalfa survey , with hi upper limits computed for all alfalfa non - detections .",
    "we have combined sdss and alfalfa redshifts with redshifts from several other surveys to achieve high completeness in the v3000 sample down to baryonic masses @xmath110@xmath195 , although residual incompleteness for dwarf galaxies remains .",
    "* below the _ gas - richness threshold scale _",
    "( @xmath3 ; baryonic mass @xmath110@xmath196 ) , gas - dominated quasi - bulgeless disks become most numerous in the galaxy population . * above the _ bimodality scale _ ( @xmath4 ; baryonic mass @xmath110@xmath197 ) , gas - starved spheroid - dominated galaxies rise to prominence , with numbers comparable to nearly quenched bulged disks .",
    "notwithstanding these transitions , we have shown that both of our samples display far greater scatter in @xmath7 as a function of @xmath5 ( a non - covariant mass proxy ) than has been commonly assumed .",
    "in particular , the nfgs reveals the natural diversity of gas richness in a sample unbiased with respect to 21 cm flux : its @xmath190 vs.  @xmath5 plot is striking in its complexity , with quenched galaxies at all masses and scatter @xmath680.5  dex even for unquenched galaxies .",
    "we suggest that the diversity of @xmath190 has been suppressed in previous studies by selection and detection biases as well as the practice of plotting @xmath190 vs.  @xmath13 , which allows large covariant errors in @xmath13 to enhance the apparent correlation .",
    "in contrast to its complicated correlation with mass , @xmath6 shows a simple and clean correlation with another fundamental quantity : the _ long - term _ fractional stellar mass growth rate ( fsmgr@xmath23 ) , which we define as the ratio of a galaxy s stellar mass formed within the last gyr to its preexisting stellar mass .",
    "the @xmath7fsmgr@xmath23 correlation represents the physical underpinnings of the remarkably tight ( @xmath198  dex ) correlation between @xmath7 and u@xmath24nir color , used in the `` photometric gas fraction '' technique of k04 , because u@xmath24nir color directly predicts fsmgr@xmath23 .",
    "importantly , a fractional growth rate is related to , but distinct from , a specific star formation rate , as it can exceed a value of one over the unit of time .",
    "choosing gyr as our unit of time reveals the remarkable fact that for an unquenched galaxy , the mass of new stars formed in the last gyr is roughly _ equal to _ the mass of fresh gas it has available for future star formation , within factors of a few .",
    "thus for galaxies , past performance is a predictor of future success .",
    "we have demonstrated that this result is incompatible with any reasonable closed box model and does not derive from the inherently short - term `` gas fuels star formation '' physics of the kennicutt - schmidt law , contrary to previous interpretations of the photometric gas fraction technique .",
    "instead , we have argued that it reflects the physics of refueling : both cosmic accretion and the mechanisms that drive internal gas processing must be routine on @xmath81  gyr timescales .      *",
    "blue quasi - bulgeless galaxies are _ accretion dominated _ , enjoying largely continuous refueling and stellar mass growth of order 100% per gyr .",
    "contrary to their reputation for `` inefficient '' star formation , such gas - dominated dwarf galaxies appear to be growing exponentially .",
    "we suggest that their high @xmath7 ratios may be more fairly interpreted as evidence that they are `` overwhelmed '' rather than `` inefficient . ''",
    "* bulged disk galaxies are _ processing dominated _ , consuming a reduced rate of fresh accretion in efficient , often externally driven bursts with net growth rates at tens of % levels .",
    "mergers and interactions in this regime create fluctuations in morphology and gas content , including transient blue e / s0 states that may regenerate spiral morphology . *",
    "red - and - dead spheroid - dominated galaxies are _ quenched _",
    "( per the usual terminology ) , with negligible gas and @xmath1110% stellar mass growth per gyr . they may grow slowly by satellite accretion .",
    "a population of `` nearly quenched '' bulged disk galaxies lies at the interface of the processing - dominated and quenched regimes , extending the @xmath7fsmgr@xmath23 relation to low levels .",
    "high ssfrs in dwarf galaxies are sometimes discounted as evidence of bursty star formation , which should average out to lower levels over time .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility of an extremely high mass - to - light ratio , low ssfr population missed in the v3000 sample due to incompleteness in the sdss redshift survey .",
    "however , we note that fsmgr@xmath23 is averaged over the past gyr .",
    "moreover , we have reviewed evidence from recent studies suggesting that dwarf galaxies are _ not _ especially bursty , except for the major bursts obviously inherent in dwarf - dwarf mergers , such as might produce blue compact dwarfs . in fact , we have argued that bulged disk galaxies are far more subject to bursty star formation than typical quasi - bulgeless dwarfs .",
    "as discussed , the burstiness of such processing - dominated galaxies likely reflects increasingly efficient mechanisms of gas processing ( both gas transport and hi - to - h@xmath89 conversion ) that develop in tandem with , and partly because of , reduced cosmic accretion .",
    "connecting back to the threshold and bimodality scales , we have seen that the mass distributions of accretion - dominated , processing - dominated , and quenched galaxies cross at these two scales , suggesting an indirect relationship between refueling and galaxy mass . focusing on galaxies that are central in their halos , we find a plausible correspondence between these galaxy mass scales and two halo mass scales previously linked to transitions in cosmic accretion ( @xmath110@xmath199 and @xmath110@xmath167 ) . in future work considering environment data we will examine the behavior of centrals and satellites separately , demonstrating that centrals evolve through the processing - dominated regime in precisely the narrow mass range between the threshold and bimodality scales .",
    "in fact the v3000 sample demonstrates that `` normal '' galaxies like our milky way  bulged disks with intermediate gas richness  are not in general typical , but most nearly approach typical in this mass range .",
    "although the analysis in this paper has not used halo mass data , our results clearly motivate the need for a full analysis of @xmath6 vs.  @xmath5 as a function of halo mass and central vs.  satellite status , for a sample that is highly complete down to galaxy masses below the threshold scale . to date no such sample exists , in that all surveys that probe the full diversity of galaxy environments lack sufficiently sensitive 21 cm data to probe the full range of @xmath7 in the dwarf regime .",
    "the nfgs offers a glimpse of the power of truly unbiased hi observations for a broad sample but lacks well characterized and fairly sampled environments , leading us back to the need for a volume - limited sample with high - quality 21 cm and kinematic data for a cosmologically diverse range of environments .",
