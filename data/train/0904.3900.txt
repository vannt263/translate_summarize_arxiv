    "one of our main purposes in this paper is to construct and analyze fully discrete galerkin - finite element methods for approximating the solution of the above ibvp .",
    "we consider the ibvp consisting of - .",
    "we assume that the bottom is _ upsloping _ , i.e. that @xmath75 , and that the problem has a unique solution , smooth enough for the purposes of the error estimation . in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2",
    "we discretize the problem in @xmath76 by the standard galerkin method and prove optimal - order @xmath0 and @xmath1 estimates for the error of the resulting semidiscretization .",
    "this is achieved by using appropriate properties of the @xmath0 and the elliptic projections onto the finite element subspace and a relevant @xmath1 superconvergence result .",
    "( the difficulty of the problem lies in the presence of the @xmath69 term in ; the condition @xmath75 , which implies that @xmath77 , is needed to obtain a basic energy inequality for the error of the semidiscretization ) .",
    "subsequently , in paragraph 2.2 , we discretize the semidiscrete problem in the @xmath58 variable using a crank - nicolson type method with a variable step - length . again , under the assumption that @xmath75 for @xmath78 , we prove @xmath0 and @xmath1 error estimates which are of optimal order in @xmath76 and @xmath58 .    in order to overcome the analytical and numerical difficulties caused by dynamical boundary conditions of the form abrahamsson and kreiss proposed in @xcite an alternative rigid bottom boundary condition , which , in the case of ( pe ) , is of the form @xmath79 this condition may be viewed as a ` paraxialization ' of ( pn ) .",

    "its numerical analysis too is straightforward ; under no restriction on the sign of @xmath73 we prove in paragraph 2.3 optimal - order @xmath0 and @xmath1 error estimates for the standard semidiscrete galerkin scheme and its crank - nicolson full discretization .    in section  [ sec55 ]",
    "we present results of various numerical experiments that we performed for problems on variable domains with the neumann and abrahamsson - kreiss bottom boundary conditions , using the fully discrete finite element methods analyzed in section  [ sec3 ] . as predicted by the theoretical stability and convergence analysis ,",
    "the finite element scheme is stable and second - order accurate when neumann boundary conditions are considered in domains with upsloping bottoms .",
    "( it also appears to be convergent in small scale problems with downsloping bottoms and also in more realistic examples if the downsloping bottom has very small slope . )",
    "the scheme with the abrahamsson - kreiss condition behaved well , as predicted by the theory , in all examples of bottoms of arbitrary shape that we ran .",
    "when we compared the results of the schemes using both boundary conditions in the case of the upsloping and downsloping rigid bottom asa wedge ( a standard test problem for long range sound propagation in underwater acoustics , @xcite ) , we found that in the upsloping case there was very good agreement between the two schemes . in the downsloping case ,",
    "the scheme implementing the neumann boundary condition was not convergent .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of abrahamsson and kreiss , @xcite , @xcite , who pointed out that for some downsloping bottom profiles one may observe instabilities in the case of the neumann boundary condition .",
    "on the other hand , the scheme with the abrahamsson - kreiss condition was convergent and its results agreed well with those furnished by the finite difference code ifd , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , implemented with the rigid bottom boundary condition option .",
    "the ifd scheme uses a discretized version of the neumann boundary condition ( pn ) , wherein the @xmath36 term is replaced by the right - hand side of the ( pe ) .",
    "we prove _ a priori _ @xmath0 estimates for the resulting ibvp .",
    "a final point of interest emerging from the numerical experiments is that , for some downsloping bottom profiles @xmath86 with an inflection point at some @xmath87 , we observed violent growth of the @xmath0-norm of the numerical solution of the problem with the neumann boundary condition for @xmath88 .",
    "this growth ( blow - up ? ) of the solution seems to be a feature of the problem and not an artifact of the numerical scheme .",
    "error estimates for a",
    "_ finite difference _",
    "scheme of second - order of accuracy in @xmath76 and @xmath58 for some of the ibvp s considered here were proved in @xcite . in the case of the neumann boundary condition",
    "these error estimates were shown to hold not only when @xmath75 but also in the strictly downsloping case @xmath89 , @xmath90 $ ] , as a result of the validity of a certain discrete @xmath1 estimate ; this estimate mimics an analogous @xmath1 estimate for the continuous problem , which holds provided @xmath75 or @xmath89 when @xmath90 $ ] . in @xcite sturm considered the abrahamsson - kreiss condition for the ( pe ) in three dimensions over a variable bottom in the more general case of a multilayered fluid medium with homothetic layers . when restricted to single layer problems in the presence of azimuthal symmetry ,",
    "the scheme of @xcite is similar to the one analyzed here in the case of the abrahamsson - kreiss bottom boundary condition .",
    "we have considerably modified the analysis of @xcite and obtain optimal - order estimates , since , by using the transformation , we essentially avoid an elliptic projection with time - dependent terms .",
    "we finally mention that a uniform range step version of the scheme of this paper and also three - dimensional extensions thereof were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the problem addressed in the present paper , namely sound propagation modelled by the ( pe ) in a single layer of water over a rigid bottom , is , of course , an idealized model problem in underwater acoustics .",
    "more realistic environments consist , for example , of a layer of water above several layers of fluid sediments of different density , speed of sound and attenuation overlying a rigid or soft bottom .",
    "if the layers are separated by interfaces of weakly range - dependent topography and low backscatter is expected , long - range sound propagation may again be modelled by the ( pe ) in each layer with transmission conditions ( continuity of @xmath91 and of @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the density and @xmath94 the normal direction to the interface ) imposed across the layer interfaces .",
    "hence , the issue arises of how to treat the dynamical interface condition , now involving @xmath36 on both sides of an interface , and the ensuing problems are analogous to those encountered in the case of the dynamical bottom boundary condition .",
    "the analysis is more complicated now , as it appears that possible non - homotheticity of the layers has to be balanced by the jump across the interface in the imaginary part of the analog of the function @xmath47 , cf . , in order to ensure the well - posedeness of the problem , @xcite . for a recent review of several issues regarding the interface problem for the ( pe ) ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite ; references to underwater acoustics computations with the ( pe ) in the presence of interfaces with change - of - variable techniques include e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we just wish to point out that range - dependent topography has often been approximated in practice by ` staircase ' ( piecewise horizontal ) bottoms and interfaces .",
    "this raises the issue of what boundary / interface conditions to pose on the vertical part of the steps of the staircase .",
    "moreover , it is well documented that staircase approximations lead to nonphysical energy losses or gains , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , @xcite . to alleviate this problem of energy non - conservation , change - of - variable techniques may be used as in the present paper .",
    "they may also be extended to interface , @xcite , or 3d - problems , @xcite .",
    "we turn now to one - dimensional ( real ) parabolic problems with dynamical boundary conditions .",
    "we consider the following model problem : for @xmath95 we seek a real - valued function @xmath96 defined for @xmath97\\times [ 0,1]$ ] and satisfying @xmath98\\times[0,1],\\\\ & u(t,0)=0\\quad\\forall t\\in\\,[0,t],\\\\ & a(t)u_x(t,1)=\\varepsilon(t)u_t(t,1)+\\delta(t)u(t,1)+g(t)\\quad\\forall t\\in\\,[0,t],\\\\ & u(0,x)=u_0(x)\\quad\\forall x\\in\\,[0,1 ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 for @xmath74 $ ] and @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 are smooth , real - valued functions .",
    "such problems occur in heat conduction , ( @xcite , section 4.3.5 ) , and in other areas ; see @xcite for a fuller list of references .",
    "our aim is to construct fully discrete galerkin - finite element approximations for the ibvp and prove error estimates , with techniques analogous to those used in the case of the schrdinger equation .",
    "we consider two different cases depending on the sign of the function @xmath102 in the dynamical boundary condition .",
    "we treat first the _ dissipative _ case , characterized by the hypothesis that @xmath106 for all @xmath74 $ ] , and in which the ibvp is well posed , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite . in paragraph 4.1",
    ", applying the standard galerkin method to this case , we prove optimal - order @xmath0 and @xmath1 estimates for the error of the resulting semidiscretization and for the crank - nicolson - galerkin fully discrete scheme .",
    "matters are more complicated in the _ reactive _ case , wherein @xmath107 for @xmath74 $ ] . in this case",
