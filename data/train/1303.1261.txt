    "the collective behavior of the plasma plays a vital role in laser plasma interactions .",
    "this has been a field of intense activity , spanning application to astrophysical phenomena@xcite , material science@xcite , and germanium telescope technology@xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the application to laser plasma accelerators ( lpa ) , which holds the promise of producing quality beams of very high energy produced over very short distances @xcite .",
    "when a laser of high power ( @xmath1 ) interacts with a high - density plasma ( density @xmath2 ) , various plasma waves are generated in the medium .",
    "the electric fields associated with such waves create an accelerating gradient of the order @xmath3 ) which is predominantly in a longitudinal direction .",
    "if some electrons either from the plasma background or externally injected are trapped in a proper phase with such fields , they may be accelerated to a relativistically high energy in a very short distance .",
    "thus various particle accelerators has been proposed ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a full discussion ) .    an effective field theoretic ( eft ) description of compton scattering has been recently developed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter referred to as i and ii ) ; compton scattering of radiation with a plasma medium was studied where the collective behaviour of medium played a vital role . remarkably , it was found that the scattered electron from the plasma exhibits ( i ) an enhanced cross - section , ( ii ) a high degree of collimation and ( iii ) a strong quasi - monochromatic behaviour , in some regions of the parameter space spanned by the plasma density and temperature .",
    "further , the strength of the equivalent accelerating field could be estimated to be @xmath4 .",
    "these features seem to bear a connection to the electron spectrum obtained in lpa , and it would be interesting to examine if the eft description can be extended to understand the physics behind lpa .",
    "the eft analysis in i and ii has several missing ingredients .",
    "( i ) the stability of collimation and monochromaticity against multiple scatterings needs to be established .",
    "( ii ) while the effective properties of the radiation were captured in the permittivity tensor , the modification of the electron properties , due to its interaction with the radiation , can not be ignored .",
    "the modification can be incorporated by considering , not free electrons , but the solutions that emerge from volkov equations @xcite .",
    "pardy has studied the solutions @xcite for some simple media .",
    "( iii ) it is necessary to take into account the non - linearity in the dispersion relations for the photon .",
    "finally , the effects of pulse shaping which is central to lpa is also not considered here .    as the first step in this direction , we examine the stability of collimation and monochromaticity of the electron spectrum due to repeated scatterings .",
    "moreover , we examine whether the electrons continue to gain energy with repeated scatterings , and whether the value can be expected to be anywhere near what is observed experimentally . that this task can be daunting can be appreciated by the fact that given the experimental parameters , the electron traverses a distance @xmath5 and gains , a few @xmath6 in a single scattering , which is a minuscule fraction of the energy @xmath7 attained over a distance of about @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , since we have completely ignored the all crucial pulse shape of the laser , it is not of much use to attempt anything more quantitative . if the approach fails even this test , any further attempt to model lpa in terms of an eft would be futile . in this study",
    ", we do find that multiple scattering can impart the desired energy , indicating that the eft description can be robust .",
    "it is worthwhile remembering at this stage that the earlier theoretical approaches have been computation intensive involving extensive numerical simulations based on the particle - in - cell approach @xcite , as may be seen , e.g , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper has been organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec_2 ] , we review and summarize briefly the basic formalism that was developed in i and ii . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec_3 ] , we set up the basic algorithm for multiple - scattering computations and study the evolution of relevant observables with the scatterings . since it would require , for an electron , a large number of scatterings ( @xmath9 ) to gain the energy of order @xmath10 and , it is a very difficult task to perform the computation for @xmath11 scatterings ; therefore , in order to get the electron spectrum after @xmath12 , we derive , in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec_4 ] , an approximate formula for the electron energy and angle in the large @xmath13 limit .",
    "then , the sensitivity of this ( extrapolated ) spectrum to the variation of the plasma parameters and the nature of the electron distribution is studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec_5 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec_6 ] , we shall point out the limitations of the present work and finally conclude the paper .",
    "when a laser interacts with the plasma medium , various electromagnetic waves ( also called plasma waves ) are generated , which are basically of two kinds : transverse and longitudinal .",
    "thus the associated compton scattering involves both transverse and longitudinal photons .",
    "these photons obey modified dispersion relations due to the permittivity of the medium .",
    "thus the scattering process gets modified at all levels including the propagator and vertex and wave - function renormalization .",
    "we may , therefore , expect compton scattering in the medium to differ significantly from free space scattering , both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "an eft for this process has been proposed in i and ii where all the above mentioned modifications were incorporated . for simplicity ,",
    "only a linear dispersion relation for the virtual photons is considered .",
    "the corresponding feynman rules and the feynman diagram for the scattering are given , respectively , in figs .",
    "[ fey_rule3 ] and [ fey_daig2 ] .",
    "we note that we employed the natural units @xmath14 there and shall do the same throughout this paper .",
    "the effective lagrangian is given by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 retain their usual forms while the field part gets modified to @xmath17 , \\label{efflag}\\ ] ] where , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the plasma ( longitudinal and transverse ) permittivities in the linear regime .",
    "@xmath20 are respectively the projectors for the transverse and longitudinal modes .",
    "if we expand the photon wave functions in the standard plane wave basis , the transverse and the longitudinal modes suffer renormalizations because of the medium .",
    "the new renormalization factors are given by @xcite    @xmath21    we are , of course , considering the process @xmath22 where the energy , momentum and spin variables are explicitly indicated for each particle .",
    "for the dispersion relations between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which get determined by the permittivity of the medium , we assume linearity but go beyond the gross - bohm expression . instead , we employ the fried - conte relations which are tabulated in @xcite .",
    "this places a restriction on the allowed values of the photon energy when the mode is longitudinal : the ratio @xmath25 $ ] , where @xmath26 is the plasma frequency .",
    "there is no such restriction on the transverse mode .",
    "the kinematics is now fairly straightforward to work out , and it has been discussed in detail in appendix [ app : appendix_b ] of ii .",
    "we may express the cross - section for each choice of the photon polarization in the form    @xmath27    where @xmath28 refer to photon polarizations in the initial and final states @xcite .",
    "the form of @xmath29 ( note that we have summed over the electron spin ) is considerably more involved than the klein - nishina formula .",
    "the complete expression may be found in the appendix [ app : appendix_a ] of this paper .",
    "finally , we note that since we are dealing with a plasma at a temperature @xmath30 , a further thermal average is required .",
    "all results of i and ii which are quoted in this section , were obtained after the thermal average .",
    "the cross - section is evaluated at the tree level ( see the diagram in fig . [ fey_daig2 ] ) .",
    "we briefly summarize the results obtained in i and ii for continuity and to lay ground for discussion here .",
    "the initial photon energy was pegged at @xmath31 , and the plasma density varied in the range @xmath32 .",
    "the plasma was taken to be at three different temperatures @xmath33 .",
    "the results obtained can be broadly summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the cross - section is completely dominated by the longitudinal plasmon mode , in particular , by @xmath34 ; @xmath35 and @xmath36 are larger than the other two contributions which are not appreciably different from the klein -nishina magnitudes .",
    "this result is valid over a region in the density - temperature plane .",
    "2 .   in the same region in the parameter space",
    ", the scattered electron spectrum reveals a high degree of collimation , with the angular dispersion @xmath37 , and is also quasi - monochromatic , with @xmath38 .",
    "thus the scattered electron energy distribution is highly non - maxwellian .",
    "the scattering time ( or , equivalently , the distance over which the electron gets scattered ) can be estimated simply by using energy - time uncertainty argument .",
    "the effective accelerating electric field is estimated to be of @xmath39 which is in accordance with the results obtained by simulations .",
    "4 .   these remarkable features are , of course , not valid everywhere in the parameter space .",
    "just as experimentalists observe , we find that when we move away from that region , collimation and momochromaticity both suffer deterioration in quality rapidly ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "this can be quantified by a convenient parameter , the beam quality index defined by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fractional cross - section in the collimated region : @xmath42 .",
    "this parameter does a good job of capturing the essential qualities of the scattered electrons ( see fig . 6 of ii , where the beam quality profile for varying densities and temperatures is shown ) .",
    "the results summarized above naturally lead to the question as to their veracity when other contributions to laser plasma scattering which we listed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] are incorporated .",
    "as mentioned , we look at one important component , namely , the multiple - scattering effects in the next section .",
    "we first outline the algorithm which we employ to compute cross - sections after repeated scatterings .",
    "( i ) to avoid unnecessary tediousness , we drop the contributions from @xmath43 and @xmath44 scatterings both of which are minuscule .",
    "( ii ) since our primary interest is in the possible energy gain by the electron , we look at only those angles where the scattered electron gains the energy after each collision .      it has been shown in ii that the expressions for the scattering angles @xmath45 ( for the photon ) and @xmath46 ( for the electron ) , both with respect to the direction of initial photon momentum @xmath47 , are given by @xmath48 + where @xmath49 is angle between the electron initial momentum @xmath50 and the photon initial momentum @xmath47 .",
    "the quantities that appear in eq .",
    "( [ theta_e ] ) are given by @xmath51    thus the algorithm can be easily expressed as a recursive equation @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are , respectively , the electron scattering angles before and after the @xmath55 scattering , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the magnitudes of respective momenta .",
    "it was seen in ii that the differential cross - sections and the energy spectrum of the electrons were similar in the @xmath58 and @xmath59 cases , with the former being larger .",
    "however , a more careful look at the kinematics reveals that the energy gain , if there is to be any , will be dominated by @xmath60 .",
    "the reasons are two fold : ( i ) the restriction that @xmath61 $ ] comes from the condition @xmath62 on the longitudinal photons .",
    "simple energetics implies that energy transfer in @xmath58 scattering can not exceed @xmath63 .",
    "however , even at @xmath64 which we consider here , although @xmath58 scattering is forbidden , @xmath59 scattering is not only allowed , but can transfer a maximum energy @xmath65 which is more than twenty five times of what is allowed in the @xmath58 case .",
    "( ii ) interestingly , even in the allowed range , kinematics places further restrictions on energy transfer .",
    "we discuss this in appendix [ app : appendix_b ] of this paper . finally ,",
    "since it serves no purpose to present the full electron spectrum after each scattering , we merely depict the evolution along the path of maximum probability , i.e. , the angle and energy at which the cross - section peaks . in doing so ,",
    "not much information is lost because of a high degree of collimation .",
    "in fact , since @xmath66 $ ] , the angular divergence is less than a milliradian .",
    "we choose the electron initial energy @xmath67 , and the initial photon with frequency as @xmath68 , with its direction along the @xmath69-axis .",
    "we choose the plasma parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "these laser and plasma parameters values are very close to the experimental values ( e.g. , those in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . further , for purposes of illustration , we choose the initial electron direction @xmath72 .",
    "the general conclusions which we draw do not , of course , rely on this special choice",
    ".      figs .",
    "[ ef_multi ] and [ scat_angle_multi ] show , respectively , the energy and the direction of the electron with the successive scatterings upto @xmath73 scatterings .",
    "we see that the electron energy increases with subsequent scatterings , while its direction undergoes a slight tilt towards the initial photon direction .         with successive scatterings.,width=7,height=6 ]    the evolution of longitudinal and transverse components of the electron momentum are shown ,",
    "respectively , in figs .",
    "[ pl_multi ] and [ pt_multi ] .",
    "the figures show almost a linear increase in both the components with successive scatterings .",
    "the interaction time , or , equivalently , the interaction length , which is the distance travelled by the electron during the interaction along the path of maximum probability , is estimated using the uncertainty relation , as in i and ii .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ int_length ] which shows the interaction lengths involved during each scattering ; they are all of @xmath74 .",
    "thus the total distance covered by the electron after @xmath73 scatterings is @xmath75 , with a corresponding energy gain of @xmath76 , as may be inferred from fig .",
    "[ ef_multi ] .",
    "since the increase in the energy is almost linear , and the order of the interaction length does not change much with subsequent scatterings , it is plausible that an energy of order @xmath0 can be gained by an electron within a traversal distance of a centimeter length .",
    "we now turn our attention to the electron spectrum , i.e. , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , after @xmath73 scatterings which are shown , respectively , in figs .",
    "[ prob_ef_theta](a ) and [ prob_ef_theta](b ) . fig .",
    "[ prob_ef_theta](c ) shows the energies of the scattered electron at various scattering angles .",
    "we can see that the whole spectrum is confined within one tenth of a milli - radian , with the energy spread , @xmath79 .",
    "it is found that the energy and angular spread do not vary much with the number of scatterings .",
    "scatterings , width=9,height=15 ]    finally , we notice that both energy and momenta show a linear increase with scattering .",
    "it is necessary to dispel the possibility that these results are an artefact of the choice of initial electron angle , if further progress is to be made .",
    "we show the increase in electron energy with multiple scatterings for various initial angles , in fig . [",
    "ef_zeta_angle](a ) .",
    "it is clear that the conclusions drawn above is not specific to the particular choice .",
    ", defined in eq . ( [ zeta ] ) , vs. number of scatterings n , for various initial angles . ,",
    "width=9,height=11 ]    we have seen in the previous section that , for a specific choice of the initial electron direction , the angular and energy spread in the scattering almost remain unaltered with acceleration .",
    "also , we found that the energy gain per scattering was independent of the initial electron angle , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ ef_zeta_angle ] ( a ) . using the independence ,",
    "we develop here an approximation technique that allows us to estimate the final cross - section after a large number of scatterings .    at this stage , it is convenient to express energy in units of electron mass , in addition to setting @xmath14 . let the energy transfer @xmath80 .",
    "thus , after @xmath13 scatterings , we get @xmath81 . thus , making use of the energy - momentum relation @xmath82 , we obtain @xmath83 which yields an approximate expression for the magnitude of the momentum .    , and ( b ) the electron energy @xmath84 , with respect to @xmath13 , for different values of the exponent @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ theta_n]).,width=8,height=10 ]    we now consider the scattering angle for the electron .",
    "first of all , the observation made in the illustration , that the scattering angle decreases with repeated scatterings , is borne out by eq .",

    "<S> we explore the physics of electron acceleration in a plasma medium in an effective field theory framework . employing a multiple compton scattering mechanism </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the acceleration can be sustained in such a medium so as to attain the energies up to the order of @xmath0 within a centimeter . </S>",
    "<S> also , the collimation and mono - energetic electron spectrum can be obtained by proper tuning of the plasma parameters with the photon frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the present work is potentially useful in understanding the physics of laser - plasma accelerators . </S>"
