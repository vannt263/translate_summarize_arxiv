    "it is a fundamental question to identify classes of domains for which the existence of solutions for partial differential equations or the validity of inequalities in sobolev spaces can be guaranteed .",
    "the last decades have witnessed a tremendous process in establishing results for different assumptions on the domains .",
    "for instance , one of the first proofs of korn s inequality , being a widely studied inequality due to its importance in the analysis of elasticity equations , was given by friedrichs @xcite for domains allowing for a finite number of corners or edges on the boundary .",
    "subsequently , generalizations appeared including versions for star - shaped sets @xcite , general lipschitz domains @xcite , and more recently results @xcite were obtained for the broader class of _ uniform domains _ using a modification of the extension operator by jones @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it has been known for a long time that many inequalities are false on domains with external cusps .",
    "several arguments have been provided for this fact ( see @xcite ) , but the oldest is due to friedrichs @xcite , who studied an inequality for analytic complex functions ( cf . also @xcite ) .",
    "recently acosta , durn , and muschietti @xcite investigated the existence of solutions of the divergence operator on _ john domains _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "apart from its application to the study of the stokes equation the result is of interest due to its connection to poincar s and korn s inequality , which may be deduced herefrom . roughly speaking , a domain is a john domain if it satisfies a _ twisted cone condition _ such that each two points can be connected by a curve not getting too close to the boundary of the domain in terms of a corresponding _ john constant _ ( we refer to section [ sec john - pre ] below for an exact definition ) .",
    "john domains represent a very general class allowing for sets with fractal boundary ( e.g. koch s _ snowflake _ ) , but at the same time excluding the formation of external cusps .",
    "they may be regarded as a very natural and in some sense most general notion of sets for the investigation of problems alluded to above since in @xcite it has been shown that for domains satisfying the separation property ( e.g. for simply connected planar domains ) the validity of poincar s or korn s inequality implies that the set is a john domain . moreover , as already observed by bojarski @xcite , the constant involved in the estimates essentially only depends on the john constant .",
    "difficulties concerning the properties and regularity of domains become even more challenging in models dealing with varying domains , e.g. _ free boundary _ or _ shape optimization problems _ , where the best shape of a set in dependence of a cost functional is identified as the solution of a variational problem ( we refer to @xcite for an introduction ) . another important class",
    "is given by _",
    "free discontinuity problems _ in the language of ambrosio and de giorgi @xcite with various applications in fields of fracture mechanics or digital image segmentation , where the set of discontinuities of the function of interest is not preassigned , but determined from an energy minimization principle ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    obviously without additional conditions",
    "there is no hope to derive uniform estimates being independent of the set shape as can be seen , e.g. , by considering a sequence of smooth sets converging to a domain with external cusp .",
    "moreover , one may think of neumann sieve type phenomena ( see @xcite ) where the set is only connected by a small periodically distributed contact zone .    therefore , many works appeared analyzing the behavior of constants in terms of the domain ( cf .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) or investigating special structures as convex , star - shaped or thin domains ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another approach particularly used in the study of free discontinuity problems is based on the idea to establish results for a certain class of admissible ( discontinuity ) sets for which uniform estimates can be shown ( we refer e.g. to @xcite ) .",
    "also the present article is devoted to the derivation of uniform estimates being independent of the particular set shape .",
    "however , we will not restrict ourselves to a specific class of sets with certain properties , but rather show that for a generic domain one may construct a partition of the set such that the shape of each component can be controlled .",
    "the main result of this contribution is the following .",
    "[ th : main result smooth ] let @xmath6 .",
    "then there is @xmath7 such that the following holds : for all open , bounded and simply connected sets @xmath0 with @xmath1-boundary there is a partition @xmath2 ( up to a set of negligible measure ) such that the sets @xmath8 are @xmath9-john domains with lipschitz boundary and @xmath10    loosely speaking , the result states that in spite of the fact that there is no uniform control of the john constant for generic domains , it is at least possible to establish uniform estimates locally in certain regions of the set . here",
    "it is essential that the fineness of the partition can be bounded in terms of the length of the boundary of @xmath5 .",
    "the original motivation for the derivation of theorem [ th : main result smooth ] is a piecewise korn inequality @xcite for special functions of bounded deformation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we hope , however , that the result may be also applied in various other situations due to the fact that john domains are a very general class and indeed many estimates only depend on the john constant ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    it is a natural question if it is possible to derive a partition of the form into sets satisfying more specific properties , e.g. convexity . by constructing an example related to koch s snowflake",
    "we see , however , that in general this is not the case and similarly as in the results for the validity of poincar s and korn s inequality ( again see @xcite ) also in the present context john domains appear to be an appropriate notion .",
    "let us remark the the regularity assumption in theorem [ th : main result smooth ] is no real restriction as in many applications domains can be approximated by smooth sets ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.42 ) ) or discontinuities can be regularized by density arguments ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the result may be generalized to sets with lipschitz boundary whose complements have a uniformly bounded number of connected components ( see theorem [ th : main part2 ] ) , which is a frequently used condition for various models in fracture mechanics or shape optimization ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the limitation to sets with a specific topology is crucial as without a requirement of this type the problem is essentially , again up to a density argument , equivalent to the derivation of a version of theorem [ th : main result smooth ] in the space of functions of bounded variation .",
    "this is an even more challenging issue and we refer to @xcite for a deeper analysis .",
    "the essential step in the proof of theorem [ th : main result smooth ] is the derivation of a version for polygons and the general case then follows by approximation of regular sets .",
    "although the methods we apply are rather elementary , the proof is comparably long and technical .",
    "therefore , we restrict our decomposition scheme and analysis to a planar setting as in higher dimensions an analogous treatment of polyhedra leads to further technical difficulties .",
    "let us remark , however , that based on theorem [ eq : addition - mainxxxxx ] in @xcite various estimates of korn and korn - poincar type are derived , which hold in arbitrary space dimension .",
    "our strategy is twofold .",
    "we introduce two special subclasses of polygons , which we call _ semiconvex polygons _ and _ rotund polygons_. we then show that ( 1 ) each polygon can be partitioned into semiconvex and rotund polygons and ( 2 ) the specific characteristics of these subclasses of polygons are essentially equivalent to the property of john domains .    loosely speaking , in semiconvex polygons concave vertices are not ` too close to opposite segments of the boundary ' ( see definition [ def : semi ] ) and rotund polygons contain a ball whose diameter is comparable to the diameter of the polygon ( see definition [ def : qussc ] ) . the decomposition scheme presented below is based on the idea to separate the domain by segments and in this context it is crucial that ( 1 ) by an iterative partition we do not violate properties which have already been established in a previous step and ( 2 ) the overall length of added segments is controllable in terms of @xmath11 .    the proof that semiconvex , rotund polygons are john domains for a john constant only depending on @xmath4 is constructive by defining appropriate piecewise affine curves between generic points of the domain .",
    "hereby we crucially exploit the fact that concave vertices are not ` too close to opposite parts of the boundary ' and that polygons are not ` too thin ' . despite the specific properties of the subclasses of polygons we still have to face additional difficulties concerning the geometry of the curves , which may , e.g. , partially have the form of a helix .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec john - pre ] we first recall the definition of john domains and state fundamental properties .",
    "in section [ sec main - pre ] we present a version of theorem [ th : main result smooth ] for polygons and give a more thorough overview of the proof .",
    "here we also discuss an example giving some intuition why john domains appear to be the appropriate notion for the formulation of the problem . in section [ sec : prep ] we introduce basic notation .",
    "the subsequent sections are then devoted to the derivation of the result for polygons . in section [ sec : semi ] we introduce the notion of semiconvex polygons , prove basic properties and present a decomposition scheme .",
    "afterwards , in section [ sec : circ ] we provide a fine analysis on the position of concave vertices and see that semiconvex polygons essentially coincide with convex polygons up to at most two small regions . in spite of their special structure convex polygons",
    "are not necessarily rotund and we therefore discuss a further method to partition convex polygons .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : equi ] we prove that semiconvex and rotund polygons are john domains with controllable john constant .    in section [ sec : proofi ]",
    "we extend our findings to sets with @xmath1-boundary and in section [ sec : gen ] we discuss a variant of theorem [ th : main result smooth ] for sets with lipschitz boundary allowing for a bounded number of components of the complement . here we also present a piecewise korn inequality as an application of our main result .",
    "we first introduce the notion of _ john domains _ and state some basic properties .",
    "consider rectifiable curves @xmath12\\to { \\bbb r}^d$ ] with length @xmath13 and assume that they are parameterized by arc length .",

    "we say a bounded domain @xmath22 is a @xmath9-john domain if there is a point @xmath23 such that for all @xmath24 there is a rectifiable curve @xmath25 \\to \\omega$ ] with @xmath26 and @xmath27 such that @xmath28 .",
    "the point @xmath29 will be called the _ john center _ and @xmath9 is the _ john constant_. domains of this form were introduced by john @xcite to study problems in elasticity theory .",
    "the term was first used by martio and sarvas @xcite . roughly speaking , a domain is a john domain if it is possible to connect two arbitrary points without getting too close to the boundary of the domain .",
    "[ rem : john ] a lot of different equivalent definitions can be found in @xcite .",
    "we will also use the following characterization : a bounded domain @xmath5 is a @xmath9-john domain if for each pair of distinct points @xmath30 there is a curve @xmath25 \\to \\omega$ ] with @xmath31 and @xmath32 such that @xmath33 .",
    "such a curve will be called _ john curve between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "_    the class of john domains is much larger than lipschitz domains and contains sets with fractal boundaries or internal cusps , where the formation of external cusps is excluded .",
    "for instance the interior of koch s _ snowflake _ is a john domain .",
    "we state a simple property ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "[ lemma : plump ] let @xmath5 be a @xmath9-john domain .",
    "then for each @xmath36 and @xmath37 with @xmath38 , there is @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "our main result will be first established for polygons . to prove theorem [ th : main result smooth ]",
    ", we then need to combine different john domains so that the unions are still john domains . in @xcite",
    "we find the following lemma .",
    "[ lemma : johna ] let @xmath41 .",
    "there is @xmath42 such that the following holds :    \\(i ) if @xmath43 are @xmath9-john domains with @xmath44 , then @xmath45 is a @xmath46-john domain .",
    "\\(ii ) if @xmath47 is a sequence of @xmath9-john domains in @xmath48 with @xmath49 for all @xmath50 , then @xmath51 is a @xmath46-john domain .",
    "the general strategy in this article is to derive the partition result first for polygons , which is easier due to the specific geometry of the boundary . in this section",
    "we present the main result for polygons and give an overview of the proof .    our partition technique for polygons will differ from widely used algorithms as triangulation , trapezoidalization or the hertel and mehlhorn algorithm ( see ) in the sense that we do not provide an optimal partition ( concerning number of pieces or runtime ) , but one where the length of the boundary of all polygons is comparable to the length of the boundary of the original polygon .",
    "we consider sets @xmath52 being the region enclosed by a simple polygon . for convenience sets of this form will be called _",
    "polygons _ in the following although the notion typically refers only to the boundary of such sets .",
    "we always assume that polygons are closed .",
    "we intent to prove the following theorem .",
    "[ th : main part ] let @xmath53 . then there is some @xmath7 and a universal constant @xmath54 such that for all polygons @xmath55 there is a partition @xmath56 with @xmath57 and the polygons @xmath58 are @xmath9-john domains satisfying @xmath59    we start with a short outline of the proof .",
    "in particular , we indicate how an arbitrary polygon may be partitioned to satisfy the condition in definition [ def : john ] for a john constant @xmath9 .",
    "first of all , the property of @xmath9-john domains may be violated if the polygon has a ` star shape ' , i.e. there are concave vertices for which the distance to other concave vertices or opposite segments of the boundary is small .",
    "we see that if this distance is too small , we can partition the polygon by introducing a short segment between a concave vertex and another point of the boundary . by this procedure",
    "we construct what we call _ semiconvex polygons _",
    "( see section [ sec : semi ] , in particular definition [ def : semi ] ) . intuitively , such sets have the property that separating the set by a short segment between a concave vertex and another point of the boundary the ` bulk part ' of the polygon lies on one side .",
    "clearly , for convex sets it is much easier to satisfy the condition in definition [ def : john ] .",
    "it turns out , however , that even a convex polygon is possibly not a @xmath9-john domains if the set is long and thin or has small interior angles .",
    "the presence of the latter phenomenon can not be avoided and therefore the introduction of the set @xmath60 in theorem [ th : main part ] is possibly necessary . to tackle the first problem , we introduce so called _ rotund polygons _ ( see section [ sec : circ ] ) which are sets containing a ball whose size is comparable to the diameter of the set .",
    "we then show that convex polygons can be partitioned into rotund polygons up to a small exceptional set ( see lemma [ lemma : convpart ] ) .",
    "finally , this kind of partition can also be performed for semiconvex polygons , which is related to the fact that a semiconvex polygon , which is not already rotund , coincides with a convex polygon up to at most two small regions ( see theorem [ th : new ] ) .    after combining the above described partitions we show in section [ sec : equi ] that semiconvex and rotund polygons are indeed @xmath9-john domains for a constant @xmath61 , which essentially only depends on the length of the additional boundary induced by the partition ( cf . ) .",
    "the basic idea is to take a shortest path between two points ( which will ` touch ' the boundary of the polygon in concave vertices ) and to modify this path in such a way that the condition in definition [ def : john ] is satisfied . to do this",
    ", it is essential that ( 1 ) the polygons contain a ball whose size is comparable to the diameter of the set and ( 2 ) concave vertices are ` not too close to opposite parts of the boundary ' .",
    "we remark that the definitions and terms of the subclasses of polygons introduced in the following sections ( see section [ sec : semi ] , section [ sec : circ ] ) are not taken from the literature but tailored for the present exposition in order to avoid the ongoing repetition of technical assumptions .",
    "let us also remark that , once the basic definition of semiconvex and rotund polygons have been internalized , section [ sec : semi]section [ sec : equi ] can be read rather independently from each other .    before we start to prove theorem [ th : main part ] , let us note that it does not appear to be possible to provide a partition for which the sets satisfy a stronger property than the one given in definition [ def : john ] . to give some intuition , we consider the following example being a modification of _",

    "due to the geometry of @xmath68 we note that after separating @xmath68 into two sets by a segment there is one set which essentially has the same shape as @xmath68 .",
