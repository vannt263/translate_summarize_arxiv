    "all stars are thought to lose mass during their main - sequence and subsequent evolution .",
    "this can range from a paltry stellar wind like that from the sun ( @xmath4  @xmath5  with speeds of hundreds of @xmath6 ) to the slow , dense winds of red giants ( @xmath7@xmath8  @xmath5with speeds of tens of @xmath6 ) to brief , violent , @xmath9  carinae - like expulsions of tens of solar masses from very massive stars . at different stages of evolution",
    ", a star will undoubtedly have different modes of mass loss .",
    "binary evolution will play a role in many cases .    while it is impossible to study in real time these different modes of mass loss in an individual star , we can do so by studying individual supernovae ( sne ) for years and even decades after the explosion .",
    "the fast - moving sn shock is effectively a time machine , encountering material shed earlier in the life of the pre - supernova star .",
    "recent years have seen a new focus on the circumstellar media ( csm ) surrounding sn sites and the interaction of supernova ejecta and shocks with csm .",
    "well - known csm - interacting sn types are the type iip @xcite , which arise in red supergiant progenitors that blow nearly steady - state winds into which the star explodes and the type iin ( sn  iin ) events , which have long been recognized to show narrow emission lines that reveal dense csm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the great luminosities of superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) are also thought to be powered , in some cases , by ejecta - csm interaction @xcite .",
    "the various types of stripped - envelope sne are also of great interest in this respect , because these events have little or no hydrogen on the progenitor at the time of explosion , but the progenitors must have once been normal hydrogen - rich stars .",
    "such events include the type iib sne , in which the hydrogen envelope has been partly expelled prior to explosion , as well as the type ibc , which essentially lost their h - rich envelope .",
    "the mechanism of these processes is ill - understood : it could be due to winds @xcite , episodic ejection @xcite or binary interactions , including common - envelope formation and ejection ( see the reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even some type ia sne , referred to as sne ia - csm , show strong h@xmath3 emission , a clear sign of csm - interaction , in their late - phase optical spectra @xcite .",
    "the collision between the fast - moving sn ejecta and the slow - moving csm creates the well - known double - shock pattern having the forward shock ( fs ) propagating into the csm and the reverse shock * ( rs ) * propagating back into the ejecta ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the acceleration of free electrons results in strong non - thermal emission , from x - rays to radio , coming from the interaction site .",
    "massive sn progenitors ( @xmath10 m@xmath11 ) can produce strong , fast - moving winds prior to explosion , which can create a low - density cavity around the explosion site , surrounded by a relatively dense csm shell consisting of previously expelled ( h - rich ) material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "when the sn ejecta hits this dense shell , it drives a strong rs into the ejecta , which leads to strong x - ray radiation from the region between the rs and the ejecta - csm interface @xcite .",
    "the hard x - rays produced by the rs are mostly absorbed by the cool , dense csm shell causing strong ionization in this medium .",
    "subsequent recombination in this h - rich csm shell results in emergent emission in the hydrogen balmer - lines , mostly h@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is thought to produce intermediate - width ( @xmath12 - @xmath13 km  s@xmath2 ) emission lines , mostly due to multiple scattering on free electrons within the shell and , to a lesser extent , bulk motion caused by the acceleration of the shell by the expanding sn ejecta at the beginning of the interaction phase .",
    "the fs propagating into the csm can also ionize the surrounding material , which may produce additional , narrow ( @xmath14 km  s@xmath2 ) h@xmath3 emission coming from the pre - shock csm in front of the fs .",
    "the appearance of the balmer - emission can be especially interesting in the case of stripped - envelope sne , since in such cases the ejecta contain only very low or negligible amount of h. thus , the emerging balmer - emission is a very strong indication that the ejecta have overrun the cavity and plunged into the h - rich csm shell .    the natural expectation that the fast - moving sn ejecta must overtake the previously expelled h - rich envelope has been beautifully demonstrated in the case of the type ibc sn  2001em , where strong radio @xcite and x - ray emission @xcite was discovered @xmath15 years after explosion .",
    "these discoveries generated further interest in sn  2001em , because the radio luminosity ( @xmath16 erg s@xmath2 hz@xmath2 at 6 cm ) as well as the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath17 erg s@xmath2 ) were far above anything seen from other sne ibc at an age of several years . since some fraction of sn ibc give rise to gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) where the jet is aimed in our direction , it was hypothesized by @xcite that sn  2001em may have been an off - axis grb .",
    "@xcite , however , suggested the strong interaction between the sn ejecta and a dense csm as an alternative mechanism which also can produce the exceptionally strong x - ray luminosity as observed by _",
    "chandra_. indeed , the late - time optical spectrum of sn  2001em , which revealed strong h@xmath3 emission @xcite , added strong support to the ejecta - csm interaction scenario .",
    "@xcite explained all the unusual late - time x - ray , radio , and optical properties , as well as the failure to resolve a possible jet via vlbi observations @xcite , by suggesting that the sn ejecta had finally caught up with the cast - off hydrogen envelope of the progenitor star and that strong interaction was taking place .",
    "a similar phenomenon is invoked in the case of ptf  11kx @xcite , a type ia - csm , where strong h@xmath3 emission developed @xmath18d after maximum in an otherwise normal - looking type ia sn .",
    "motivated by the examples above , we started an observational survey to monitor several years - to - decades - old h - deficient sne in order to catch signs of the starting ( or ongoing ) ejecta - csm interaction .",
    "our concept is that numerous sn ia and/or ibc may show detectable csm interaction at such late phases , because their csm shells may have reached greater distances from the explosion site than in those well - known cases when the interaction started within a few hundred days after explosion . assuming that the h - rich envelope travels with a speed between 10 and 100 km  s@xmath2 @xcite , the interaction with the fast - moving ejecta ( @xmath19 km  s@xmath2 ) is expected to start roughly a decade after sn explosion if the expulsion of the envelope ended @xmath20 ",
    "@xmath21 years before core collapse , depending on wind speed .",
    "the aim of our observations is the direct detection of the h@xmath3 emission due to the collision between the h - poor sn ejecta and the surrounding h - rich csm via imaging the sn sites through narrow - band filters centered on the ( redshifted ) wavelength of h@xmath3 . in sections  [ sec : obs ] and [ sec :",
    "method ] we give details of the observations and our methodology of detecting h@xmath3 emissions .",
    "section  [ sec : res ] shows our early results , which are further discussed in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we utilized the 2.7 m ( 107 \" ) harlan j. smith telescope equipped with the direct imaging auxiliary functions instrument ( diafi ) at mcdonald observatory for conducting the imaging survey .",
    "we applied a narrow - band ( @xmath22 nm ) h@xmath3 filter centered on the redshift of the virgo - cluster ( @xmath23 , @xmath24  ) and another similar filter at an off - line position ( @xmath25  ) as a guard - band filter to measure the continuum flux near the h@xmath3 line . in the following we refer to these filters as h@xmath3-on and h@xmath3-off , respectively .",
    "we have selected a subsample of the full list of 3662 known sn  i ( sn  ia , sn  ibc ) and sn  iib discovered before 2014 , based on the following selection criteria :    * declination higher than @xmath26 ; * distance less than @xmath27 mpc .",
    "this resulted in 747 potential candidates .",
    "these are sampled further , concentrating on the closest ( @xmath28 mpc ) events .",
    "the number of sne in the restricted sample is 178 .",
    "beside observability from the northern hemisphere , the reason for these selection criteria were twofold : @xmath29 to have the h@xmath3 line redshifted into the transmission band of the h@xmath3-on filter , and @xmath30 to be able to reach a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath31 for @xmath32 erg  s@xmath2 ( i.e. a signal similar to sn  2001em ) within @xmath33 hour exposure time with diafi .",
    "we started our multi - season observing campaign in 2014 , using both the h@xmath3-on and -off filters on the sne with @xmath34 mpc .",
    "since then we have imaged 76 galaxies hosting 99 sne , i.e. @xmath35 percent of the total sample .",
    "the journal of the observations can be found in table  [ tab : journal ] .",
    ".the journal of narrow - band imaging observations with diafi [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have detected ( using the criterion of s / n @xmath36 ) continuum - subtracted h@xmath3 emission from 27 sn sites ( see table  [ table : detect ] ) .",
    "at least 14 of these detections ( @xmath31 percent ) are clearly from diffuse h@xmath3 emitting sources , probably nearby h  ii areas .",
    "the others look like point sources in our diafi frames , but some of them appear slightly off - center with respect to the expected sn position , and thus could just be nearby compact h  ii clouds .",
    "figure  [ fig : f2 ] and [ fig : f3 ] show the collection of the positive detections .",
    "the 3rd column of table  [ table : detect ] contains the average of the redshift - independent distances taken from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "based on these distances and the milky way extinction coefficient in the @xmath37-band from @xcite , the logarithm of the calculated h@xmath3 luminosities and their uncertainties ( expressed in erg s@xmath2 ) are shown in the 4th and 5th columns of table  [ table : detect ] .",
    "the ( likely underestimated ) uncertainties are pure photometric errors described above and do not contain any other effects , e.g. the uncertainty of the distances or any in - host extinction .    in figure",
    "[ fig : f4 ] we give an example of a strong ( s / n @xmath38 ) detection on the continuum - subtracted image .",
    "sn  2005kl is the strongest h@xmath3-emitting object in our sample .",
    "its h@xmath3 luminosity , @xmath39 erg  s@xmath2 ( table  [ table : detect ] and figure  [ fig : f5 ] ) , is about an order of magnitude greater than that of the largest h  ii clouds @xcite , which strongly suggests that the detected h@xmath3 emission is ( at least partly ) due to sn - csm interaction .",
    "figure  [ fig : f5 ] shows the plot of the derived h@xmath3 luminosities as a function of distance .",
    "it is seen that , on average , point sources tend to be brighter than diffuse sources ( the median luminosities for the two groups are @xmath40 erg  s@xmath2 and @xmath41 erg  s@xmath2 , respectively ) , but both types of sources can be found at all luminosity levels , except for the exceptionally bright point source sn  2005kl .",
    "further hints of the possible presence of ejecta - csm interaction may be gained from the temporal variability of the detected h@xmath3 sources .",
    "sn - csm interaction usually produces variable h@xmath3 emission on the timescale of @xmath42 days @xcite , although there are known cases , e.g. sn  1988z , a strongly interacting type iin @xcite ) showing nearly constant h@xmath3 luminosity over @xmath43 days .",
    "nevertheless , we imaged 38 sne on at least two epochs separated by at least 90 days to detect any variability in the net h@xmath3 emission from the sn site .    in figure",
    "[ fig : f6 ] we plot the light curves of 10 detected h@xmath3 emitters that were observed at least three times .",
    "it is seen that 6 of them do not show any change that exceeds the uncertainties , although sn  1981b , 2013dk and 2014c exhibited continuous variation ( either increase or decrease ) during our observations .",
    "flux changes exceeding the photometric errors significantly ( i.e. larger than @xmath44 ) were found in the case of sn  1985f ( ib , @xmath45 ) , 2005kl ( ic , @xmath46 ) , 2010gi ( iib , @xmath47 ) and 2012fh ( ic , @xmath48 ) .",
    "sn  2010gi , a type iib sn , is a diffuse source ( figure  [ fig : f3 ] ) that is more affected by the changing atmospheric conditions , because the applied flux - scaling method that corrects for changing atmospheric transparency ( see above ) works reliably only for point sources .",
    "thus , we do not believe that the variability detected at the position of sn  2010gi is real , and , instead , we attribute this to an instrumental effect .",
    "the other three objects are sne - ibc , and they are all point sources , thus , their variability is more convincing .",
    "again , variability of the h@xmath3 line flux alone can not be considered as proof of the ejecta - csm interaction , but it might give additional support for this hypothesis , for example in the case of the extremely strong h@xmath3 emitter sn 2005kl , which is also a strongly variable source .",
    "even though it is difficult to prove the existence of ejecta - csm interaction from only narrow - band imaging , without spectroscopic and/or multi - wavelength ( x - ray and/or radio ) observations , our data at hand strongly suggest that csm interaction is the likely explanation for the h@xmath3 emission in at least a few of the sne in our sample .",
    "the collision between the sn blast wave and the expelled , slowly moving h - envelope can certainly produce h@xmath3 emission in the same order of magnitude as observed , as already demonstrated by sn  2001em ( section  1 ) .",
    "sn  2004dk ( type ib ) is another example , where sn - csm interaction was detected in x - rays by _ xmm - newton _ shortly after explosion @xcite , and by radio observations at late phases @xcite .",
    "although @xcite concluded that `` it is unlikely that the shockwave is interacting with a h - rich common envelope '' based on a single nebular spectum of sn  2004dk that showed only a weak , narrow , unresolved h@xmath3 emission feature attributed to ism @xcite , our solid ( s / n @xmath49 ) detection of a strong point source at the sn position may suggest that the blast wave has finally reached the expelled h - rich envelope .",
    "the lack of variability ( fig.[fig : f6 ] ) , however , does not strengthen this interpretation , thus , follow - up observations will provide important constraints for this case .",
    "emission from sn 2014c ( encircled ) in may 2015 ( at @xmath43 days after explosion ) and june , 2016 ( at @xmath50 days ) .",
    "the decrease of the h@xmath3 flux between the two epochs is apparent .",
    "the size of the frames is @xmath51 arcmin@xmath52 .",
    "[ fig : f7],width=321 ]    a more recent example occurred during the progress of our project . after emerging from solar conjunction ,",
    "the type ib sn  2014c started to show strong h@xmath3 emission @xmath53 days after explosion , even though h was absent from its spectrum during the photospheric phase @xcite .",
    "accompanied by contemporaneous strong x - ray and radio emission , this remarkable metamorphosis was explained by ejecta - csm interaction @xcite , the same mechanism for which we search .",
    "we detected the appearance of the h@xmath3 emission from sn  2014c on our diafi frames taken between 2015 may and 2016 june ( @xmath43 and @xmath50 days after explosion , respectively ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : f7 ] shows the continuum - subtracted diafi frames obtained on 2015 - 05 - 19 and 2016 - 06 - 07 ( left and right panels , respectively ) , with the object encircled .",
    "its h@xmath3 luminosity ( table  [ table : detect ] ) is in agreement with the independent spectroscopic measurements given by @xcite .",
    "this source seems to show continuously decreasing net ( i.e. continuum - subtracted ) h@xmath3 flux ( see figure  [ fig : f6 ] ) , but due to the relatively large errorbars of its photometry , the detected overall flux change did not exceed @xmath54 during the @xmath33 year baseline of our observations .",
    "more recently , sn  2014c was also detected in mid - ir bands with the _ spitzer _ space telescope by the spirits project , as a variable point source @xcite .",
    "note that @xcite observed an _ increase _ of the mid - ir fluxes from sn  2014c between 200 and 600 days after explosion , while our observations span only the later ( @xmath55 days ) phases .",
    "the latest _",
    "observations from the spirits project , partly published by @xcite , show a slow but continuous decline of mid - ir fluxes between @xmath56 and @xmath57 days in both the @xmath58 and the @xmath59 bands , in agreement with our h@xmath3 observations .",
    "@xcite explained the observed re - brightening of sn  2014c in the mid - ir as due to shock heating ( either radiative or collisional ) of pre - existing dust around sn  2014c , which is in good agreement with the observations in other bands , including our h@xmath3 detections .",
    "this highlights the importance of simultaneous observations in non - optical bands , in order to detect additional tracers of the ejecta - csm interaction that may discriminate between the different mechanisms producing the contemporaneous h@xmath3 emission .",
    "the relatively low number of detected h@xmath3-emitting point sources ( 13 out of 99 sne , i.e. @xmath60 percent ) is more - or - less consistent with the recent estimate for the rate of the sn  2001em/2014c - like events published by @xcite based on late - time re - brightening in the radio . from 41 type ibc sne having radio coverage at @xmath55 days after explosion , @xcite found 4 cases ( sn  2001em , sn  2003gk , sn  2007bg and sn  iptf11qcj , @xmath0 percent of the sample ) when luminous radio re - brightening was observed years after core collapse . since",
    "radio light curves are usually attributed to sn - csm interaction , the emergence of radio fluxes at such late phases are very strong signs for the ejecta - csm collision . their result ( @xmath0 % ) is consistent with our detection rate ( @xmath60 % ) when taking into account that at least some of our detected h@xmath3 emitters could also be compact h  ii areas very close to the sn site , i.e. the detected emission may not be due to ejecta - csm interaction in every case .",
    "variability in the detected h@xmath3 line emission can be another tracer for the sn - csm interaction , because h  ii clouds are usually close to ionization / recombination equilibrium , and do not show noticeable variation in their emission line strengths . on the contrary , existing models on the ejecta - csm interaction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict several forms of variability in the produced radiation .",
    "the most commonly accepted scenario is the close link between the x - rays produced by the rs and the h@xmath3 line emission coming from the h - rich dense shell in between the fs and the rs ( see section  1 ) .",
    "since the main source of the escaping h@xmath3 line photons are the x - rays absorbed by the shell , any kind of variation in the absorbed x - rays can imply change in the emergent h@xmath3 flux . at the beginning of the interaction",
    "the models predict a relatively quick rise ( @xmath43 days ) of the x - ray flux @xcite followed by a slower decline after the fs passed through the dense shell and the shell got accelerated by the sn ejecta piling up from behind @xcite .",
    "the deceleration of the rs , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the power - law index of the density profile in the outer part of the sn ejecta , is also partly responsible for the decrease of the h@xmath3 luminosity since @xmath63 @xcite and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the efficiency of converting the x - ray flux to h@xmath3 photons and @xmath66 is the mass of the dense csm shell @xcite . in addition , at later phases the shell gets diluted by expansion , reducing the x - ray optical depth , which causes further decrease in the produced h@xmath3 radiation .    in figure",
    "[ fig : f6 ] there are examples for increasing ( e.g. sn  1981b , 2012fh ) as well as decreasing ( sn  2005kl , sn  2014c ) h@xmath3 luminosities . in the simple interaction scenario described above",
    ", the increasing h@xmath3 fluxes might be connected with an early - phase , still strengthening ejecta - csm interaction , while the declining h@xmath3 fluxes could be explained by a more evolved interaction .",
    "the possibility for the developing ejecta - csm interaction around the type ia sn  1981b , as suggested by the persistent ( even though not statistically significant ) increase in its h@xmath3 luminosity , is especially interesting , since is the only sn  ia in our sample that shows such a phenomenon .",
    "since the baseline of our survey is still less than 1000 days , and we have only a few measured points for each sne , it is premature to draw any definite conclusion on such details .",
    "future observations will be useful to decide whether these sne are indeed subject to ejecta - csm interaction .",
    "our narrow - band imaging survey of old , h - deficient ( type ibc , ia and iib ) sne through h@xmath3 filters resulted in the following :    * detection of continuum - subtracted h@xmath3 emission from 27 sne sites ( see table  [ table : detect ] ) , 13 of which are point sources at our resolution ; * detection of significant variation ( exceeding @xmath44 ) of the h@xmath3 emission from 3 sne : sn  1985f , sn  2005kl , sn  2012fh ( all sn  ibc and point sources ) .",
    "sn  2010gi , a diffuse source around a sn  iib , also shows some sort of variability , but its reality is more uncertain ; * a strong , variable h@xmath3 emitter , sn  2005kl ( sn  ic ) , for which the h@xmath3 luminosity exceeds that of the typical h  ii regions by an order of magnitude ; * detection of h@xmath3 emission from the known late - time interacting sn  2004dk and sn  2014c ; * possible variation in the h@xmath3 emission from sn  1981b ( ia ) , sn  2012p ( iib ) , sn  2013dk ( ic ) and sn  2014c ( ib ) .",
    "we conclude that in the case of the three variable h@xmath3 emitters , i.e. sn  1985f , sn  2005kl and sn  2012fh , the source of the net h@xmath3 emission is likely the ongoing ejecta - csm interaction .",
    "the robustness of our methodology is demonstrated by the successful detection of the well - known interacting sn  2004dk and sn  2014c .",
    "the number of the detected point - source h@xmath3 emitters , 13 out of 99 sne , is consistent with the recently estimated rate ( @xmath0 percent ) of such events @xcite .",
    "in addition to continuing our narrow - band * imaging * for all nearby type  i sne , we plan to obtain spectroscopic and multi - wavelength data , from radio to x - ray bands , for the sne listed in table  [ table : detect ] to confirm and characterize the ejecta - csm interaction .",
