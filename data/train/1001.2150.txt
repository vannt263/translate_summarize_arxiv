    "a defect - free crystal is a macroscopic quantum system with spatial periodicity . in principle , only nonlocal observables are probed by plane waves , eg . with diffraction or spectroscopy techniques .",
    "this is attested by the marked localization in reciprocal space of bragg peaks as well as discrete phonon states . however , since the seminal work of slater @xcite , the nonlocal nature of protons is commonly overlooked in crystals containing bistable o ",
    "hydrogen bonds , when the coexistence of two configurations , say `` @xmath4 '' for @xmath5 and `` @xmath6 '' for @xmath7 , is conceived of as classical disorder .",
    "this leads to a conflict of interpretation consisting in that a statistical distribution of protons should destroy the translation periodicity of the crystal , whereas infrared and raman spectra evidence extended states at the brillouin - zone center ( bzc ) obeying the symmetry - related selection rules of the crystal .",
    "this conflict has been tolerated because the nonlocal nature of protons can not be evidenced by x - ray diffraction .",
    "even with neutrons , a bragg peak analysis is not conclusive , for statics and dynamics can not be unravelled effectively from the unit - cell structure factor @xcite .",
    "the same conflict of interpretation arises for crystals containing hydrogen bonded centrosymmetric dimers , such as carboxylic acids @xcite , or potassium hydrogen carbonate ( or bicarbonate , khco@xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "the thermal interconversion between tautomeric configurations , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , is supposed to be correlated with a reorganization of the single and double co bonds , along a reaction path across a multidimensional potential .",
    "this is commonly rationalized with rigid proton - pairs in an asymmetric double - well coupled to an incoherent thermal bath mimicking a liquid - like environment .",
    "it is supposed that `` phonon - induced incoherent tunnelling '' should prevail at low temperatures , whereas stochastic jumps should take the lead at elevated temperatures . by contrast ,",
    "vibrational spectra are consistent with nonlocal observables represented by normal coordinates .",
    "there is no evidence of any symmetry breaking due to local disorder and the density - of - states remains discrete at any temperature @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the local or nonlocal behaviour of bistable hydrogen bonds can be distinguished at advanced pulsed neutron sources , with a time - of - flight laue diffractometer measuring a much broader range of reciprocal space than any reactor - based four - circle instrument .",
    "the scattering function measured at large momentum transfer values ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the initial and final wave vectors , respectively ) contains information on the scale of spacial correlations between @xmath4 and @xmath6 sites ( @xmath13  ) .",
    "moreover , such an instrument is unique to observing diffuse scattering , because signals in addition to bragg peaks are effectively measured across the whole range of reciprocal space for each neutron pulse .",
    "it is thus possible to determine whether or not coherent scattering is affected by the coexistence of @xmath4 and @xmath6 configurations at various temperatures .",
    "this has been exemplified with the crystal of khco@xmath2 made of hydrogen bonded dimers , ( hco@xmath14 @xcite . below 150 k , only those proton sites ( @xmath4 )",
    ", corresponding to a unique configuration for dimers ( @xmath8 ) , are occupied .",
    "the neutron scattering function reveals enhanced bragg peaks exclusively at those particular @xmath15-values corresponding to the reciprocal sublattice of protons .",
    "furthermore , the enhanced peaks are superposed to a prominent continuum of incoherent scattering , cigar - like shaped along @xmath15-vectors perpendicular to dimer planes . by contrast , there is no evidence of similar enhanced features for the isomorphous derivative kdco@xmath2 . to the best of our knowledge , the dramatic increase of both coherent and incoherent scattering intensities for the sublattice of protons , not observed for deuterons , can not be explained with any conventional model based upon slater s localized particles .",
    "alternatively , a quantum theory leads to different macroscopic quantum correlations ( entanglement ) for indistinguishable protons ( fermions ) or deuterons ( bosons ) .",
    "the enhanced features can be thus explained by the spin symmetry of the `` super - rigid '' fermion states for which phonons are forbidden . by contrast ,",
    "deuteron states are represented by phonons with no spin - symmetry .    above 150 k , the less",
    "favored sites along the hydrogen bonds ( @xmath6 ) , at @xmath16   from the @xmath4 sites , are progressively populated , while the space group symmetry and the unit cell parameters remain unchanged . at 300 k , the population ratio is @xmath17 .",
    "the enhanced features observed continuously from cryogenic to room temperatures show that the quantum correlations are temperature independent .",
    "the coexistence of @xmath8 and @xmath9 configurations is consistent with a quantum superposition of proton states perfectly insulated from decoherence by the other degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "then , scattering functions , vibrational spectra , and quasi - elastic neutron scattering ( qens ) data , can be reinterpreted consistently with nonlocal observables and quantum interference arising from the superposition of macroscopic tunnelling states .",
    "structural transitions of second order ( @xmath18 ) occur at @xmath19 k ( khco@xmath2 ) or @xmath20 k ( kdco@xmath2 ) . above @xmath21 , dimers split into two centrosymmetric entities , symmetric with respect to the plane @xmath22 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the enhanced features of the scattering function , as well as proton dynamics and quantum interference , do not show any discontinuity at @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence of classical disorder above @xmath21 .",
    "it transpires that quantum correlations arise from the space periodicity of centrosymmetric dimers , irrespective of the space group symmetry .",

    "static or dynamical disorder are clearly differentiated and the existence of distinct crystallographic domains of khco@xmath2 or kdco@xmath2 is excluded .",
    "a static distribution of mutually exclusive particles should destroy the quantum entanglement and the enhanced features should vanish . alternatively ,",
    "if isotopes merge into separable macroscopic states , such that quantum correlations across the sublattice of protons survive , the enhanced features should be observed , although with lower contrast compared to khco@xmath2 .",

    "there was no evidence of any significant decrease of bragg peak intensities into laue monotonic diffuse scattering due to a statistical distribution of isotopes .",
    "alternatively , for a sublattice of paired up nonseparable protons and deuterons , the averaged scattering length should be : @xmath36 the model is more artificial because @xmath37 is no longer a free parameter and it is less satisfactory ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "however , it can not be definitely excluded .",
    "consequently , the question as to whether the sublattices of protons and deuterons are separable entities remains largely open .",
    "the conclusions of the present work are based upon the neutron scattering function of the mixed isotope crystal presented in sec .",

    "these streaks are not an artefact of the instrument because : ( i ) the detectors were calibrated with vanadium ; ( ii ) the streaks are measured by different detectors for each of the 8 orientations of the crystal ; ( iii ) spurious signals eventually due to an anomalous detector should appear along different trajectories .    the maps in fig .",

    "there is , therefore , every reason to conclude that the crystal is a macroscopic quantum system for which only nonlocal observables are relevant .",
    "because quantum entanglement emerges naturally from the crystal structure , there is no reason to introduce any further interaction . from the viewpoint of economy ( ockham s razor ) , alternative theories based upon quantum exchange @xcite or spin - spin",
    "interaction @xcite are less satisfactory . moreover , these correlations are very unlikely to be significant and it is doubtful that these short - range interactions , essentially confined to dimers , could account for macroscopic correlations , especially at elevated temperatures .",
    "protons are unique to demonstrating quantum entanglement , because they are fermions and because the very large incoherent cross - section can merge into the total coherent cross - section .",
    "no other nucleus can manifest such an increase of its coherent cross - section .",
    "the enhanced features can be , therefore , unambiguously assigned to protons , in accordance with their positions in reciprocal space .",
    "they are evidences of macroscopic quantum correlations which have no counterpart in classical physics .    according to the theory , the pair correlation function for protons represented by ellipsoids in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] are due to measurement induced phonons .",
    "the structure free of induced distortions should comprise dirac functions for protons and ellipsoids for deuterons .",
    "the spatial wave functions for protons ( [ eq:5 ] ) describe the distribution of the center of mass of the proton states with respect to that for all other atoms and the uncertainty principle holds at each site of the perfectly correlated sublattice .",
    "it is widely believed that macroscopic objects are , in principle , governed by the laws of quantum mechanics and classical physics is an emergent phenomenon at an appropriate limit when the system interacts with an environment that might as well consist of its internal degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the crystal of bicarbonate is a counterexample that is never amenable to classical physics , because ( i ) quantum entanglement is as robust as the crystal ; ( ii ) the adiabatic separation insulates the proton states from every decoherence mechanism ; ( iii ) the energy gap for excited proton states is much greater than @xmath231 .",
    "a different approach places the emergence of classicality on the impossibility of distinguishing individual quantum levels with coarse - grained measurements @xcite .",
    "transposed to diffraction , the interaction potential in ( [ eq:7 ] ) is replaced by the mean potential , @xmath232 , that is then fourier transformed into the unit - cell structure factor @xcite .",
    "eigen states and nonlocal observables are thus translated into classical variables for particles located at definite sites and neutrons scattered by various nuclei can interfere , irrespective of whether or not these nuclei are involved in the same eigen states . because of the opposite signs of the scattering lengths for protons and deuterons",
    ", interferences could build up in such a way that some bragg peaks would be more intense for khco@xmath2 than for kdco@xmath2 , or vice versa .",
    "however , these enhanced peaks are not expected to single out the reciprocal sublattice of protons and the structure factor does not account for the enhanced incoherent scattering along @xmath61 in any way .",
    "in addition , the rigid - body analysis does not provide any evidence of correlation between protons and heavy atoms @xcite .",
    "there is , therefore , experimental support to conclude that the assumption of classicality emerging from coarse - grained measurements is only a convenient approximation hiding the quantum nature of the crystal .",
    "nevertheless , quantum effects embedded in the bragg peaks transpire as the mean scattering length ( [ eq:2 ] ) is less satisfactory than the mixture of distinct sublattices ( [ eq:1 ] ) , although the difference is not large enough to be firmly conclusive .",
    "neutron diffraction and raman spectra show that the mixed isotope crystal is not a statistical mixture of khco@xmath2 and kdco@xmath2 entities .",
    "the crystal is a macroscopic quantum system made of separable matter waves over the isomorphous sublattices of khco@xmath2 and kdco@xmath2 .",
    "the quantum theory shows that deuteron ( boson ) states can be represented by phonons whereas antisymmetrized proton ( fermion ) states demonstrate super - rigidity and spin - symmetry .",
    "this macroscopic quantum entanglement is energy free and decoherence free .",
    "it is as robust as the crystal structure and the emergence of the classical regime at elevated temperatures is forbidden .",
    "the main outcome of the present work is that macroscopic quantum effects for protons are not destroyed by deuteron states . despite their different masses , isotopes are not defects leading to localization , possibly because they are isoelectronic .",
    "the quantum theory of diffraction by proton states allows us to distinguish different events .",
    "first , in the most general case , momentum transfer destroys the quantum entanglement and regular bragg peaks are observed .",
    "second , for those particular @xmath15-values matching the nodes of the reciprocal sublattice , the super - rigidity and the spin - symmetry are probed without any measurement induced symmetry breaking .",
    "the incoherent cross - section merges into the total coherent cross - section and the corresponding peaks show markedly enhanced intensities featuring macroscopic quantum entanglement . because of the anomalous debye - waller factor , these peaks are observed at large @xmath15-values and they are temperature independent .",
    "third , for those @xmath15-values matching only the nodes of the reciprocal planes of protons , the spin - symmetry is destroyed and cigar - like shaped rods of incoherent scattering by the super - rigid planes are observed in between the enhanced peaks . clearly , the unit - cell structure factor is not appropriate to account for these enhanced features .",
    "this work presents one single case of macroscopically entangled states on the scale of avogadro s constant in a mixed isotope crystal at room temperature .",
    "the quantum theory suggests that such macroscopic quantum effects should be of significance for many hydrogen bonded crystals .",
