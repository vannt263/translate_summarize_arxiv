    "evolution of the orbit of a star under the influence of interactions with an accretion disc has been studied by numerous authors because this situation is relevant to inner regions of active galactic nuclei .",
    "the trajectory of an individual star is determined mainly by gravity of the central mass and surrounding stars while periodic transitions through the disc act as a tiny perturbation .",
    "the final goal is to understand the fate of a star , transfer of mass and angular momentum between the star and the disc , and also to determine how star - disc interactions influence the distribution of stellar orbits near a massive central object .",
    "an important and difficult task is to estimate the probability that a star gets captured from an originally unbound orbit , and to determine whether this probability is significant compared to other mechanisms of capture .",
    "orbital evolution of a body crossing an accretion disc has been discussed with various approaches , first within the framework of newtonian gravity , both in theory of the solar system ( pollack , burns & tauber 1979 ; mckinnon & leith 1995 ) and for active galactic nuclei ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; syer , clarke & rees 1991 ; artymowicz 1994 ; podsiadlowski & rees 1994 ) .",
    "these studies have been generalized in order to account for the effects of general relativity @xcite and to model a dense star cluster in a galactic nucleus @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized that detailed physical description of the star - disc interaction is a difficult task ( zurek , siemiginowska & colgate 1994 , 1996 ) . in this letter a simplified analytical treatment of stellar orbital parameters",
    "is presented , describing the initial stage of star - disc collisions ( when the star crosses the disc once per revolution ) .",
    "a great deal of our calculation is independent of microphysics of star - disc interaction .",
    "it is shown how our solution matches the corresponding rauch s solution which is valid in later stages , when eccentricity of the orbit becomes small enough .    in the next section our approach to the problem",
    "is formulated and an analytical solution is given .",
    "then , in sec .  [ details",
    "] , further details about the derivation of the results are presented , and finally a simple example of the orbital evolution is shown in sec .",
    "[ example ] .",
    "newtonian gravitational law is assumed throughout this paper .",
    "our solution is based on the following assumptions :    ( i ) : :    the disc is geometrically thin and its rotation is keplerian ; ( ii ) : :    at the event of crossing the plane of the disc , velocity of the star    is changed by a tiny quantity .",
    "this impulse is colinear with the    relative velocity of the star with respect to the material forming the    disc ; ( iii ) : :    the star crosses the disc once per revolution ( the model is applicable    to the initial phase of the stellar capture ) .    the first item is a standard simplification in which the disc is treated in terms of vertically integrated quantities , while the second one can be expressed by the formula for an impulsive change of the star s velocity :    @xmath0    @xmath1 is an unconstrained function , given by a detailed model of the star - disc interaction , and @xmath2 is relative velocity of the star and the disc material .",
    "we stress , that our results are uniquely based on this assumption of colinearity , @xmath3 ; the coupling factor @xmath1 is arbitrary and it can be as complex as necessary . in particular , @xmath1 contains information about the surface density @xmath4 of the disc ( @xmath5 outside an outer edge @xmath6 of the disc ) .",
    "the form of @xmath1 must be specified only for examination of temporal evolution of orbital parameters .",
    "we will assume , in analogy with rauch ( 1995 ) , a simplified formula for    @xmath7    when it is needed for purpose of an example .",
    "( [ 22two ] ) @xmath8 denotes radius of the star , @xmath9 is its mass , @xmath10 escape velocity ( @xmath11 ) ; @xmath12 is normal component of the star s velocity to the disc plane , and @xmath13 is a usual long - range interaction factor ( coulomb logarithm ) .",
    "the star s orbit is traditionally characterized by the keplerian osculating elements : semimajor axis @xmath14 , eccentricity @xmath15 , inclination @xmath16 to the accretion disc plane , and longitude of pericenter @xmath17 ( measured from the ascending node ) .",
    "a derived set of parameters turns out to be better suited to our problem : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21",

    "in fact , condition ( [ 2nine ] ) states that the initial keplerian orbit has the same radius of intersection as the final orbit , after successive interactions with the disc .",
    "longitude of the node is also conserved and can be set to zero without loss of generality .",

    "we examine parabolic orbits ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) with pericenter in the disc plane ( @xmath81 ) , and the pericenter distance @xmath45 equal to the disc radius ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "initial inclination @xmath34 of the orbit to the disc plane is a free parameter in this example .",
    "evolution of this set of orbits is split into two phases .",
    "first , we let the orbits evolve according to the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ one])([four ] ) from the initial value @xmath83 of the formal parameter @xmath27 to its final value @xmath84 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the evolution of the inclination @xmath85 , measured in terms of the initial value @xmath34 .",
    "notice that the critical inclination @xmath35 of eq .",
    "( [ thirteen ] ) is @xmath86 eccentricity of the orbits under consideration decreases according to a simple formula @xmath87 ( independently of @xmath34 ) , leading eventually to circularized orbits at @xmath88 .",
    "we observe that orbits with @xmath89 terminate at the final state @xmath90 , suggesting that the circularization time - scale is comparable to that necessary for grinding the orbit into the disc plane . on the other hand , when @xmath91 the final circular orbits remain inclined significantly to the disc plane .",
    "( @xmath92 corresponds to retrograde orbits . ) hence , for those orbits the circularization time - scale is shorter than the time necessary for tilting the orbit to the disc plane .",
    "additional time to incline a circularized orbit is not much longer than circularization time , however .",
    "the difference is typically a factor of 10 for highly retrograde orbits .",
    "secondly , we examine the evolution of circularized orbits which started with @xmath91 and have settled to nonzero @xmath93 .",
    "because these orbits have zero eccentricity , there exists rauch s integral in the form @xmath94 . here",
    ", we adopted a formal continuation of the @xmath27 parameter to values smaller than unity ( in this phase , @xmath95 ) .",
    "for each orbit , we calculate the value of @xmath96 , so that the inclination is given by    @xmath97    obviously , a given orbit terminates its evolution at @xmath98 when it is pushed completely into the disc plane .",
    "dashed curves in figure  [ fig1 ] correspond to constant values of @xmath99 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] illustrates how function @xmath54 changes during the first circularization phase of the evolution . for each orbit",
    "we have chosen the same steps in @xmath27 ( 0.2 ) in the range @xmath100 , as in figure  [ fig1 ] , and we computed the corresponding values of @xmath54 from eq .",
    "( [ fifteen ] ) .",
    "our results agree with rauch s finding , namely that @xmath54 is conserved up to a factor of @xmath101 for orbits with large eccentricity . during the second phase of the evolution the @xmath75-function is constant .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows time intervals @xmath102 which elapse in the course of gradual circularization when eccentricity decreases from @xmath103 to some terminal value ( here , terminal eccentricity has been fixed to @xmath104 ; notice that @xmath105 goes to infinity for terminal eccentricity @xmath106 ) .",

    "( [ time ] ) can be written in physical units in the form    @xmath107    @xmath108 and @xmath109 are gravitational radii of the central mass and the star , respectively .",
    "a typical surface density profile of the disc has been assumed , as in eq .",
    "( 1 ) of rauch ( 1995 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath110 corresponds to the estimate in addendum to zurek , siemiginowska & colgate ( 1996 ) .",
    "we have found a solution describing the evolution of orbital parameters of a star orbiting around a massive central body in a galactic nucleus and interacting with a thin keplerian disc .",
    "the solution is in a parametrical form valid for an _ arbitrary radial distribution of density and a very broad range of models of the star - disc interaction_. temporal evolution can be given in terms of quadrature provided the star - disc interaction is specified completely ( in terms of function @xmath1 ) .",
    "our approach can be applied to other situations but the form of eq .",
    "( [ 2ten ] ) is linked to the assumption about interactions , eq .  ( [ 2one ] ) .",
    "also the situation when the orbit intersects the disc twice - per - revolution requires a specific form of @xmath1 to be given and , most likely , it does not allow a complete analytic solution .",
    "our solution thus describes the initial phases of the stellar capture ( large eccentricity ) and it matches smoothly the low - eccentricity approximation . apart from an interesting form of analytical expressions ,",
    "our approach is useful as a part of more elaborate calculations . in an accompanying detailed paper ,",
    "additional effects are taken into account ( e.g. , gravity of the disc ) and distribution of a large number of stars is investigated ( vokrouhlick & karas 1997 , submitted to mnras ) .",
