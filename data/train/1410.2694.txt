    "consider a one - dimensional integer - valued symmetric random walk starting at zero , conditioned to stay non - negative .",

    "this is often called a wetting transition @xcite .",
    "the critical parameter @xmath14 depends crucially on the single - step variance @xmath4 ; in simple examples such as the symmetric walk with increments in @xmath17 one finds that @xmath14 scales linearly in @xmath4 as @xmath18 @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider a natural generalization where the pinning at the origin is replaced by a long range pinning potential @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the reward for a visit to the state @xmath21 . to be specific , for a trajectory @xmath8 of length @xmath22 , define @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of visits to state @xmath2 .",

    "delocalized ) phase is characterized by @xmath29 ( resp .",
    "@xmath30 ) . under mild assumptions on the random walk kernel and on the pinning sequence @xmath31",
    ", we prove that the wetting transition occurs at a critical value @xmath32 of the ratio @xmath33 and that @xmath34 for universal constants @xmath35 .    as far as we know , this is the first analysis of the wetting transition for a multi - level pinning problem of the general form .",
    "we refer to @xcite for previous studies of certain specific models of random walks with pinning on several layers .",
    "it is interesting to note the analogy between our condition for delocalization and the classical bargmann - jost - pais @xcite criteria for the absence of bound states for the radial schroedinger equation ; cf .",
    "remark [ jost ] below for a discussion of this point .    the most challenging part of the proof is to show delocalization for @xmath36 small .",
    "that requires establishing an upper bound on the partition function @xmath37 where the sum runs over non - negative trajectories returning to the origin at time @xmath22 and @xmath38 is the probability of @xmath8 . using the strategy outlined below",
    "we prove that @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a universal constant and @xmath41 , the sum being over all trajectories returning to the origin at time @xmath22 . clearly , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the probability that a path returning to the origin after @xmath22 steps remains non - negative .",
    "well known bounds show that @xmath44 , so that the estimate establishes delocalization .",
    "to prove we argue as follows .",
    "the first step is to decouple the problem into a collection of independent pinning problems , one for each height level @xmath45 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath46 so that @xmath47",
    ". then , jensen s inequality implies that @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the partition function of a random walk returning to the origin after @xmath22 steps , pinned at height @xmath2 with pinning strength @xmath50 .",
    "the next step is to show that , if the parameter @xmath36 is small enough , then _",
    "uniformly _ in the law of the random walk and in the height @xmath2 , one has @xmath51 . using @xmath52 , this bound implies .",
    "the main idea of the proof goes as follows . with a natural inductive argument",
    "we show that , for all @xmath22 larger than a critical `` diffusive '' scale @xmath53 , one has @xmath54 , provided that the same holds for @xmath55 .",
    "the base case of the induction is solved by a fine analysis based on careful local limit theorem estimates .",
    "it is only at this stage , that is when @xmath55 , that we need to take the parameter @xmath36 small enough .",
    "the method outlined above is rather accurate in finding the threshold for the wetting transition . in this respect , we remark that a direct `` energy vs.  entropy '' argument such as the one used in @xcite would fail to capture the right dependence in the parameter @xmath56 for instance .",
    "moreover , our method is robust enough to admit an extension to the setting of self - avoiding paths , as we discuss below .",
    "one of the motivations for this work stems from the mathematical analysis of contour models arising in low - temperature two - dimensional spin systems and related interface models . in this context",
    "the random walk is replaced by a self - avoiding and weakly self - interacting random lattice path with an effective diffusion constant @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the inverse temperature . here",
    "the analog of the pinning strength @xmath59 above typically decays like @xmath60 for @xmath61 with @xmath62 . whether such long range potential is able to localize the contour is a key question in the analysis of large deviations problems such as e.g.  the wulff construction for the 2d ising model @xcite and for the @xmath63-dimensional solid - on - solid model @xcite .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "our approach can be applied in principle to this setting . in section [ paths ] below we work out the details of this extension in the simplified case where the self - avoiding path has no additional self - interaction .",
    "the general case has been recently solved in @xcite , with stronger results , with a very different approach .",
    "the main idea of @xcite consists in constructing , out of the self - interacting contour path , an effective random walk together with a renewal structure and then prove delocalization for the latter .",
    "we consider a class of symmetric and irreducible random walk kernels on @xmath64 with variance @xmath56 .",

    "below we shall restrict ourselves to random walk kernels in the class @xmath69 .",
    "while we do not believe this to be the largest possible class for our results to hold , the above assumptions turn out to be very convenient from the technical point of view . at the same time",

    "we refer to this as the _ sos walk _ at inverse temperature @xmath58 , from its relation with the so - called solid - on - solid model .",
