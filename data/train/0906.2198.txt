    "then , we give a lower bound with the same order of growth although with a different constant in the leading term .",
    "let @xmath115 , with @xmath45 , and @xmath269 .",
    "let @xmath270 be defined as @xmath271 clearly , the measure of @xmath11 is infinite .",
    "let us consider the eigenvalue problem @xmath272 since @xmath273 as @xmath5 , the domain is quasibounded , namely , @xmath274 and the spectrum is discrete , consisting of a sequence of eigenvalues @xmath275 , repeated according their multiplicity .",
    "we want to estimate the order of growth of @xmath276 to this end , let us introduce a family of rectangles @xmath277 , and an open set @xmath278 such that @xmath279 : @xmath280\\times[-g(j ) , g(j ) ] , \\qquad v =   \\big(\\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty q^j\\big)^{\\circ}.\\ ] ] also , the set @xmath278 is quasibounded and the spectrum of the laplace operator in @xmath278 is a sequence @xmath281 , repeated according their multiplicity .",
    "moreover , the monotonicity of eigenvalues respect to the domain gives @xmath282    we have the following inclusions of sobolev spaces : @xmath283 where @xmath284    we can compute by separation of variables the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the laplace operator in each @xmath285 with mixed boundary conditions . we get @xmath286 hence , we define the eigenvalue counting function @xmath287 let us note that we can assign to each eigenvalue a lattice point @xmath288 with @xmath289 and the square @xmath290\\times ( k-1,k]$ ] , and the number of eigenvalues with @xmath291 is @xmath292 $ ] . by using the area of the ellipse which contains those squares , we get @xmath293    now , the dirichlet - neumann bracketing together with proposition [ lema3 ] implies @xmath294 but we can not replace the previous bound yet .",
    "let us note that @xmath295 if @xmath296 i.e. , for @xmath297 .",
    "hence , by using the estimate , the euler - mclaurin formula and proposition [ obsinf ] , we obtain @xmath298    therefore , we have proved the following theorem :    [ upper - quasib ] let @xmath115 , with @xmath45 , and @xmath270 be defined as @xmath271 then , the eigenvalue counting function of the eigenvalue problem satisfies @xmath299    when @xmath300 with @xmath45 , then @xmath301 and @xmath302 .",
    "so , we have @xmath303 following @xcite , the order of growth can not be improved , since this is the right one for horn - shaped domains .    in",
    "much the same way we prove the following lower bound :    [ lower - quasib ] let @xmath115 , with @xmath45 , and @xmath270 be defined as @xmath271 then , the eigenvalue counting function of the eigenvalue problem satisfies @xmath304    as before , let us introduce a family of rectangles @xmath305 and @xmath306 , where @xmath307\\times[-g(j+1 ) , g(j+1 ) ] , \\qquad   u = \\big(\\bigcup_{j=1}^\\infty q_j\\big)^{\\circ}.\\ ] ] then , @xmath308 and the dirichlet - neumann bracketing together with proposition [ lema3 ] implies @xmath309    the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the laplace operator in @xmath310 with dirichlet boundary conditions are @xmath311 therefore ,",
    "the counting function @xmath312 is @xmath313    let us assign to each eigenvalue the lattice point @xmath288 with @xmath314 , and the square @xmath315 .",
    "hence , @xmath316    clearly , @xmath317 since in the first quadrant , the ellipse of semi - axes @xmath318 and @xmath319 is covered by the squares @xmath320 and the rectangles @xmath321 , @xmath322 + 1)\\times[0,1)$ ] .",
    "we consider only @xmath323 ( if not , @xmath324 , and @xmath312 is nonnegative ) and we get @xmath325    finally , as in the previous proof , @xmath326 and the proof is finished .    from theorems",
    "[ upper - quasib ] and [ lower - quasib ] we obtain that @xmath327 for horn - shaped domains @xmath328 with @xmath329 , and @xmath38 monotonically decreasing continuous function .",
    "observe that , as @xmath99 satisfies ( h2 ) , we have @xmath330 this result improves the upper bounds obtained in @xcite , which only gives an upper bound for @xmath49 whenever @xmath331 .",
    "it would be desirable to obtain a better knowledge of the asymptotic behavior , namely , @xmath332 ( for certain constant @xmath61 ) as in @xcite , and even a second term as in @xcite .",
    "however , without imposing more restrictions on the functions @xmath99 or @xmath38 , we believe that this can not be possible , since the main term can oscillate , as the following one  dimensional example suggest . this example is borrowed from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath333 , where @xmath334 consist of @xmath335 intervals of lengths @xmath336 , for @xmath337 .",
    "then , the spectral counting function of problem satisfies @xmath338 where @xmath339 is a bounded periodic function , and @xmath340 .    since @xmath341 = \\sum^{\\infty}_{-\\infty }   m^j \\left [ \\frac{{\\lambda}^{1/p}}{n^{j-1}\\pi_p } \\right ] - o({\\lambda}^{1/p}).\\ ] ] by changing variables ,",
    "@xmath342 we get @xmath343 and @xmath344 , for @xmath340 , and we obtain @xmath345 - o({\\lambda}^{1/p } ) = \\frac{{\\lambda}^{d / p}}{m}s(\\log({\\lambda}))- o({\\lambda}^{1/p})\\ ] ] and , as @xmath346 , @xmath339 is a periodic function with period equal to one .",
    "this example can be extended to @xmath22 , by defining @xmath333 , where @xmath334 consists of @xmath347 disjoints squares of sides @xmath336 .",
    "when @xmath11 has finite measure , similar examples were considered in @xcite , where oscillating second term were obtained for the spectral counting function of the laplace operator in @xmath11 with dirichlet boundary conditions in the boundary of each square .",
    "it is not difficult to extend those arguments to the infinite measure case ( that is , @xmath348 ) , to obtain in this way a quasibounded set with an oscillating main term .",
    "however , the set obtained in this way is not a horn .",
