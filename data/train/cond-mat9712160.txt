    "this picture remains almost unchanged in the presence of relatively strong inelastic processes within the sample@xcite which lead to dephasing ( the loss of phase - coherence ) at the time scale @xmath8 : the conductance distribution remains almost gaussian although its variance is no longer universal but decreases @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a spatial dimensionality .",
    "in contrast , it has been shown more recently that the conductance distribution is pronouncedly non - gaussian in almost closed systems like chaotic cavities with single channel leads @xcite , quantum dots in the regime of coulomb blockade@xcite where the distribution of the heights of the coulomb blockade peaks has been measured experimentally,@xcite or isolated conducting rings threaded by an aharonov ",

    "the nature of the distribution changes considerably when dephasing is substantial , @xmath15 , so that the energy levels overlap .",
    "this case allows also a perturbative treatment@xcite in the framework of the standard diagrammatic expansion .",
    "a crucial question here is how to describe the level broadening in quantum dots with point - like external contacts .",
    "the first approach , following ref .",
    ", was to attach an additional voltage probe in which electrons lose their phase coherence before being re - injected into the dot.@xcite another approach was to include an imaginary potential in the hamiltonian thus allowing for the possibility that electrons may leave the dot.@xcite however , brouwer and beenakker @xcite have recently pointed out that these approaches do not describe inelastic processes _ within _ the dot .",
    "while the voltage probe accounts for spatially localized dephasing only , the imaginary potential in the hamiltonian does not conserve the particle number . in order to describe dephasing processes within the dot",
    ", they have introduced@xcite in the framework of random matrix theory a new variant of the voltage probe model which produces spatially uniform dephasing .",
    "thus it was found that the conductance distribution became gaussian for strong dephasing , @xmath16 .",
    "note that experiments measuring conductance fluctuations in quantum dots , for example as a function of shape,@xcite also find a gaussian distribution .",
    "in this paper we present a microscopic diagrammatic calculation of the conductance distribution function within a dirty quantum dot with two point contacts in the presence of strong dephasing processes ( @xmath16 ) within the dot .",
    "we construct a particle - conserving model by clearly separating two different mechanisms of level broadening : dephasing processes which contribute only to the conductance fluctuations and particle leakage which contributes also to the mean value of conductance .",
    "it enables us to resolve a contradiction between the results of the imaginary potential model @xcite that suffered from the violation of particle conservation and the voltage - probe model.@xcite by calculating the moments of the conductance distribution , we will show that for @xmath17 it is almost gaussian with the variance @xmath18 this expression is valid both in the ergodic zero - mode regime , @xmath19 , and in the diffusive regime , @xmath20 . here",

    "( [ var ] ) is different from that obtained in ref .  .",
    "in contrast to a cavity with broad leads,@xcite ( which corresponds to a multi - channel case so that the fluctuations remain universal ) the variance is non - universal even in the diffusive regime , @xmath28 .    the factor @xmath29 which governs the distribution width resembles the standard weak - localization parameter .",
    "this could be seen from the first line of eq .",
    "( [ zr ] ) where @xmath30 is a classical dimensionless conductance of a sample with broad leads",
    ". nevertheless , the origin of this parameter is quite different : the variance is not very sensitive to the presence of a magnetic field and thus has nothing to do with weak localization effects .",
    "when time - reversal invariance is absent , the variance ( [ var ] ) changes only by the standard dyson s factor of @xmath31 , typically for mesoscopic effects , where @xmath32 for the orthogonal ensemble ( in the presence of potential scattering only ) , and @xmath33 for the unitary ensemble ( in the presence of a finite magnetic field or weak scattering by magnetic impurities that breaks time - reversal symmetry ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the close - to - gaussian nature of the distribution is established in a way somewhat less straightforward than for ucf in samples with broad leads.@xcite had it been possible to restrict considerations to the lowest order of perturbation for the variance and higher moments , we would have obtained the exponential distribution as in the imaginary potential model , @xcite albeit with a shifted position of the mean .",
    "however , the leading contribution to the moments is given by the next ( two - loop ) order of perturbation while contributions from higher orders are negligible .",
    "in considerations of conductance fluctuations in quantum dots with single - channel leads , the lowest order of perturbation does not make a leading contribution due to the existence of two different perturbative parameters related to qualitatively different contributions to the level broadening .",
    "although both of them arise also in considering any mesoscopic effect for a diffusive sample with broad contacts , only one of them is relevant in that case as we explain below .",
    "we adopt the impurity diagram technique @xcite to perform ensemble averaging over disorder with allowance for dephasing processes . at the first step ,",
    "we assume a conventional model of free electrons in a random gaussian potential @xmath34 , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the one - electron density of states and @xmath38 is the mean elastic scattering time .",
    "a standard perturbative expansion @xcite is a loop - expansion with the loops being built up of diffusons and cooperons ( if time reversal symmetry is preserved ) .",

    "1 ) with a pole at small transferred momenta ( diffusons ) or small total momenta ( cooperons ) . for an isolated @xmath10-cubic sample of size @xmath1 with @xmath39 such a diffusion propagator ( _ diffuson _ ) at @xmath40 , i.e.  in the absence of inelastic processes ,",
    "is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the diffusion constant , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 with @xmath45 being non - negative integers .",
    "in the presence of time reversal symmetry , the cooperon propagator has the same form .    for weak disorder ,",
    "the diffusion propagator is proportional to the fourier transform of the density - density correlation function , @xmath46 which describes the probability of finding at the point @xmath47 at time @xmath48 a diffusive particle injected at the origin at @xmath49 .",
    "particle conservation implies that @xmath50 at any time @xmath51 . on performing the fourier transform",
    ", one then obtains that @xmath52 .",
    "this exact identity remains valid also at @xmath53 when one includes a weak interaction leading to dephasing processes in the sample .",
    "therefore , the diffuson associated with @xmath54 remains the same as in eq .",

    "a cooperon ladder is obtained by inverting the direction of one of the arrows .    mathematically , particle conservation in the diffuson associated with the density - density correlation function ( which we call _ the intrinsic diffuson _ ) is due to the ward identity which provides an exact cancellation of the one - particle self - energy corrections due to inelastic processes by vertex corrections ( described graphically as interaction lines between the two sides of the diffusion ladders ) .",
    "however , if one defines the diffuson in terms of the sum of graphs describing diffusive propagation in the particle - hole channel _ without energy exchange _ between the particle and hole line , it is no longer proportional to the density - density correlation function and it is not constrained by particle conservation . @xcite the absence of the usual cancellation of self - energy corrections by vertex corrections leads to the appearance of the cutoff @xmath57 in the diffusion pole .",
    "@xcite this is precisely the kind of diffuson arising in typical lowest - order conductance - fluctuations diagrams@xmath58 and describing correlations between _ different members of the ensemble _ which makes energy exchange between the opposite sides of the diffusion ladder impossible . we will call this kind of diffuson _",
    "inter - sample_. note that all the cooperon propagators , either intrinsic or inter - sample , have exactly the same cutoff , @xmath57 , as the inter - sample diffusons.@xcite    therefore , one can allow for dephasing by merely including @xmath57 as an infrared cutoff in the denominators of _ inter - sample _ diffusons , i.e.  substituting into eq .",
    "( [ dp ] ) @xmath57 for @xmath59 at zero frequency . at @xmath53 , averaging over energies leads@xcite to the saturation of the denominators of _ inter - sample _ diffusons .",
    "a consistent description of both thermal smearing and dephasing requires the use of the temperature technique@xcite and the development of a microscopic theory of dephasing in the partially open dot which would provide a dependence of @xmath60 on @xmath61 and microscopic characteristics of the dot .",
    "such a theory is well established for relatively large diffusive samples with broad leads@xcite or for closed quantum dots.@xcite    however , our aim here is just to describe how dephasing and thermal smearing influence mesoscopic fluctuations of conductances of the dot . to this end , all we need is to distinguish between the two kinds of diffusons : _ inter - sample _ diffusons which are saturated at @xmath62 , and _ intrinsic _ diffusons which diverge at @xmath62 . since the divergence of this sort could not be treated within the diagrammatic approach , we introduce a weak level broadening @xmath63 due to escape from the dot which provides a cutoff for the _ intrinsic _ diffusons . the cutoff in the intrinsic diffuson",
    "violates the particle conservation law but since we restrict our considerations to the case @xmath64 , it is dephasing ( or thermal smearing ) within the dot rather than particle escape which governs the conductance distribution .",
    "even with this cutoff , @xmath65 , i.e.  there is a sharp distinction between the _ intrinsic _ diffusons , @xmath66 , and the _ inter - sample _ diffusons , @xmath67 . for simplicity , we shall use a zero - temperature diagrammatic technique .",

    "( [ var ] ) .",
    "the existence of the two kinds of diffusons was practically irrelevant for the description of mesoscopic conductance fluctuations in samples with broad leads.@xmath58 firstly , there is strong leakage through the leads , @xmath72 , and one could restrict considerations to the case of weak dephasing , @xmath73 , when both intrinsic and inter - sample diffusons have the same cutoff .",
    "moreover , even for larger samples or higher temperatures when @xmath74 , the intrinsic diffusons do not appear either in @xmath75 or in var@xmath76 but as a third - order perturbation correction which is irrelevant in a weakly disordered metal .",
    "in contrast to this , in the problem under consideration the intrinsic diffusons determine the value of @xmath75 and enter var@xmath76 in the leading order of perturbation .",
    "traditionally conductance fluctuations in a system with broad , spatially homogeneous contacts are considered@xmath58 by means of the kubo formula @xcite .",
    "alternative considerations based on the landauer - bttiker formula @xcite are more convenient in the presence of tunnel barriers @xcite or for a lead geometry which involves spatially inhomogeneous currents . in this paper",
    "we will use this formula in the form first derived by fisher and lee:@xcite @xmath77where the transmission coefficient @xmath78 is the probability of transmission from the channel labeled by @xmath79 in the left ( right ) lead to the channel labeled by @xmath80 in the right ( left ) lead . in the case of single - channel leads ( of width @xmath81 ) the point - to - point conductance , @xmath76 ,",

    "@xmath37 is a constant and the @xmath88 are energy independent so we will subsequently drop the @xmath89 label . thus we imply that energy dependence will also be irrelevant for the conductance fluctuations : as usual , this is valid when the energy difference between two conductances , @xmath90 , is much smaller than the level broadening which we assume to be the case .",
    "we consider the region of parameters defined by @xmath91here the level broadening due to escape from the dot is represented by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the level broadening due to escape from the dot other than through the point contacts , for example due to leakage through the dot matrix .",
    "our perturbative approach is formally applicable both to the non - ergodic diffusive regime , @xmath94 , and to the ergodic zero - mode regime , @xmath95 .",
    "the inequality @xmath96 is a crucial distinction from the imaginary potential model @xcite where the opposite inequality holds .",
    "this allows us to separate dephasing processes inside the dot from those due to weak particle leakage .",
    "the latter have been introduced only for convergence of the perturbative approach which is not valid for @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , a weak violation of particle conservation is inevitable in the perturbative approach as will be explicitly shown later .",
    "however , this weak particle non - conservation is not related to the level broadening due to dephasing inside the dot and , as we shall see , may be totally neglected in the final results . on the contrary , in the imaginary potential model both the level broadening and the particle non - conservation",
    "have exactly the same source and can not be separated which makes this model unsuitable for considerations of the influence of inelastic processes inside the dot on the conductance distribution .",
    "the nonperturbative region @xmath97 was the main area of interest for previous zero mode calculations .",
    "@xcite however , the exact zero - mode calculations within the nonlinear @xmath13 model can not be extended ( at least , in a straightforward way ) to include relaxation processes inside the dot by simply introducing @xmath60 .",
    "the reason is that all intra - sample diffusons _ must _ and all intrinsic diffusons _ must not _ contain a cutoff proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "these two kinds of diffusons which are both elementary excitations in the nonlinear @xmath13 model must be distinguished automatically .",
    "this can be easily done in the perturbative approach to the @xmath13 model @xcite by the introduction of an extra set of matrix indices to numerate different conductance loops .",
    "while this additional dependence does not lead to any complication in perturbative or renormalization group calculations , it would make direct zero mode calculations rather difficult if possible at all .",
    "obviously , one circumvents this complication when dephasing is included phenomenologically , as in the voltage probe model where one can proceed with zero - mode calculations .",
    "@xcite however , there is a price to pay : as two kinds of diffusons are not distinguished , this model contains @xmath60 proportional corrections to the mean conductance@xcite even in the absence of time - reverse invariance when such corrections can not appear in all orders of perturbation as we will show below .",
    "the present model overlaps with the voltage probe model in the ergodic zero - mode regime ( with strong dephasing ) : @xmath98 . even in this case , the overlapping is restricted to the region @xmath99 as the requirement of convergence of perturbation series does not allow us to take the limit @xmath100 .",
    "nevertheless , both the models address clearly the same physical situation where dephasing occurs inside the dot , and the results of the present considerations are in a broad agreement with the voltage probe model .",
    "moreover , we shall argue later that the perturbative approach might be valid even outside the formal limits of applicability . note finally that since our considerations always refer to strong dephasing with a noticeable leakage ( @xmath101 ) , the results are applicable both for statistics of the heights of the coulomb blockade peaks ( for @xmath102 ) and for the conductance distribution of a single - channel cavity ( for @xmath103 ) .",

    "that is why the conductance distribution in the absence of time reversal symmetry obtained@xcite from the microscopic formula ( [ lb ] ) turns out to be different from that obtained@xcite from the reduced formula @xmath110 .",

    "this is easy to verify as the calculation is much simpler than the standard one in the diffusive regime .",
    "one could assume that the cancellation of the main logarithms in all higher orders in the diffusive regime corresponds to a similar cancellation of the zero mode contributions .",
    "since in the latter case there is no renormalization group backing , such a cancellation remains only a plausible hypothesis .",
    "nevertheless , it is certain that in the absence of time - reversal invariance no correction due to dephasing may appear as they are forbidden by particle conservation .",

    "indeed , in this case cooperons vanish , and particle conservation strictly prohibits the appearance of @xmath57 in any power of expansion in diffusons . however , this disagreement is minor , and is clearly due to differences between the models .",
    "let us stress that in contrast to the imaginary potential model , our present microscopic considerations confirm the prediction of the voltage probe model on the gaussian character of the conductance distribution with a non - universal variance depending on the dephasing rate .    the most distinctive feature of the perturbative approach used here was taking into account two different sources of level broadening , one due to the presence of contacts entering the classical part of the mean conductance , and the other due to dephasing , appearing only in weak localization corrections and fluctuations .",
    "it remains an open question as to whether a similar introduction of two different sources of level broadening could be used within a non - perturbative approach such as the supersymmetric nonlinear @xmath13 model , thus enabling a calculation for @xmath216 .",
