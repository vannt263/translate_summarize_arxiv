    "in the last decade it became evident that some of the observed type ia supernovae are intrinsically sub - luminous compared to the majority of so - called `` normal '' sne ia .",
    "sn  1991bg ( filippenko et al . , 1992 ) is now considered as their prototype , and the sample of well - observed events includes sn  1992k ( hamuy et al . , 1994 ) , sn  1997cn ( turatto et al . , 1998 ) and sn  1998de ( modjaz et al . , 2000 ) . beside being about 1 magnitude fainter than normal sne ia at maximum",
    ", sub - luminous sne ia also exhibit peculiar colors and spectra .",
    "for example , the intrinsic ( unreddened ) @xmath9 color around maximum is 0.7 @xmath5 0.8 magnitude redder than normal sne ia , reaching @xmath10 mag at 10 days after maximum light .",
    "the spectroscopic peculiarity is represented by @xmath11 the appearance of strong ti  ii band in the blue region and @xmath12 the increase of the ratio of the depths of si  ii absorption troughs at 5800   and 6150   ( @xmath1(siii ) ) ( e.g. nugent et al . , 1995 ) . moreover , sub - luminous sne ia have steeply declining light curves .",
    "their decline rate parameter is @xmath13 instead of 1.0 @xmath5 1.5 as for normal sne  ia ( e.g. phillips et al . , 1999 ) . because both @xmath1(siii ) and @xmath14 correlate with the peak luminosity , the observational data indicate that sub - luminous sne ia have less energetic explosions and less ejected ni masses than normal sne ia , although the correlation between the different quantities can not be described with a single parameter ( hamuy et al .",
    ", 1996 , hatano et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "in this paper we present medium resolution spectra of the sub - luminous ia - type supernova sn  1999by occured in ngc  2841 .",
    "chronicles of the discovery and the earliest observations can be found in iau circulars no .",
    "gerardy & fesen ( 1999 ) pointed out very soon that the spectrum of sn  1999by is of type ia , while garnavich et al .",
    "( 1999 ) noted that sn  1999by belongs to the group of sub - luminous sne  ia based on the @xmath1(siii ) line depth ratio .",
    "early - phase spectra of such sne are available only for sn  1991bg and sn  1997cn .",
    "thus , the spectroscopic observations made around maximum light may supply interesting details about peculiar sne ia .",
    "very recently howell et al . (",
    "2001 ) presented spectropolarimetric evidence for the strong ( @xmath15 ) asphericity of the ejecta of sn  1999by , suggesting a connection between the observed asymmetry and the mechanism producing sub - luminous sne ia .",
    "our new observations are described in sect.2 , while their interpretation is given in sect.3 .",
    "sect.4 summarizes the results of this paper .",
    "sn  1999by was observed with the 1.88 m telescope and cassegrain spectrograph of the david dunlap observatory on three nights between may 10 and 21 , 1999 .",
    "the 150a grating in 2nd order with an order separation filter in the stellar beam was applied , resulting in a reciprocal dispersion of 1.22  / pixel on the ccd detector .",
    "the recorded spectra cover about 1250   centered on 6000  .",
    "reduction was performed by standard routines in @xmath16 is distributed by noao which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy ( aura ) inc . under cooperative agreement with the national science foundation ] .",
    "the wavelength scale was calibrated with fear spectral lamp exposures .",
    "the background light due to the host galaxy was approximated with a quadratic polynomial perpendicular to the dispersion axis and subtracted from the sn aperture at each wavelength .",
    "because of the rarity of photometric nights at the ddo site ( in the proximity of toronto ) , precise flux calibration of the spectra was not possible .",
    "however , an approximate correction for the ccd spectral response has been determined by obtaining the spectra of three nearby field stars ( # 2 , # 3 , # 4 of skiff , 1999 ; see fig.1 of tth & szab , 2000 ) .",
    "their @xmath17 indices ( 0.59 , 0.75 , 0.60 mag , respectively ) corresponds to @xmath18 k according to the tables of schmidt - kaler ( e.g. carroll & ostlie , 1996 ) . the measured continua of these stars could be approximated by a smooth polynomial .",
    "the real continuum fluxes ( assuming @xmath19 ) were estimated from model spectra of buser & kurucz ( 1992 ) .",
    "then , the wavelength - dependent sensitivity of the used ccd spectrograph was calculated by dividing the measured continua with the chosen model continuum flux values .",
    "the resulting function turned out to be smooth and slightly decreasing to the red .",
    "we have looked for any sudden drop in the sensitivity function that might distort the depths of spectral lines and found nothing .",
    "the sn spectra were then corrected by dividing the measured spectra with the approximate sensitivity function described above . because the used comparison stars were not spectroscopic standards , the corrected `` continuum '' slopes of the sn spectra",
    "may still be slightly distorted .",
    "nevertheless , the sn spectra calibrated in such a way are acceptable for a comparative analysis described in sect.3.1 .    the reduced spectra are collected and plotted in fig.1 .",
    "the epochs of the observations are indicated on the right side of each spectrum .",
    "the phases relative to b - maximum were determined by adopting the result of bonanos , et al .",
    "( 1999 ) that the maximum in @xmath20 occured on jd 2451308.5 ( may 9/10 , 1999 ) , which was also confirmed by photometry of tth & szab ( 2000 ) ( note that the jd of maximum light was misprinted in both papers ) .",
    "although the spectral coverage is rather small , the appearance of the strong si  ii line around 6150    unambigously identifies a type  ia sn .",
    "the other strong feature , the absorption trough at 5800  is also attributed to si  ii .",
    "the relative strength of this line to that of the 6150   line @xmath1(siii ) ( nugent et al . , 1995 ) suggests that sn  1999by is a sub - luminous event , as mentioned in sect.1 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.2 , where the maximum - light spectrum of sn  1999by is plotted together with a pre - maximum spectrum of sn  1998aq ( vink et al . , 1999 )",
    "obtained with the same instrument and setup ( unfortunately , no spectrum of sn  1998aq closer to its maximum light was available for us ) .",
    "the spectra in fig.2 were normalized to the local `` continuum '' for illustrative purpose .",
    "it is visible that the 5800   line is much weaker in sn  1998aq than in sn  1999by .",
    "this line gets stronger in pre - maximum spectra of sne ia when approaching the maximum , however , in `` normal '' sne the increase of @xmath1(siii ) is only 0.04@xmath50.06 ( riess et al . , 1998b ) .",
    "thus , the 5800   feature was not much stronger in the spectrum of sn  1998aq at maximum .",

    "@xmath1(siii ) = 0.63 was obtained for the may 11 spectrum , while @xmath1 = 0.66 was determined for the may 14 one , in accord with the result of garnavich et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( see also hatano et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "this is more than a factor of 2 larger than its usual value of @xmath24 for normal sne ia ( riess et al , 1998b , hatano et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "very recently howell et al . (",
    "2001 ) published three spectra of sn  1999by made just before our observations . from their fig.1 we estimated @xmath1(siii ) = 0.68 , 0.70 , 0.66 at epochs @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "these agree very well ( within a few hundredths ) of the results derived from our spectra , suggesting that our observations probably do not contain wavelength - dependent systematic errors distorting the line - depth ratio .",
    "@xmath1(siii ) correlates with the luminosity parameter @xmath8 introduced by riess et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in the multi - color light curve shape ( mlcs ) method",
    ". a calibration of the linear dependence of @xmath1(siii ) on @xmath8 was given by riess et al .",
    "( 1998b ) , resulting in @xmath26 for @xmath27 day phase , while for @xmath28 days the slope and zero point changes to 2.06 and @xmath50.46 , respectively . substituting the @xmath1(siii ) values given above one can get @xmath29 for the luminosity parameter of sn  1999by ( the given error takes into account the quoted uncertainty of the @xmath1 - @xmath8 calibration ) . for `` normal '' sne ia @xmath30",
    ", therefore , this high value suggests that sn  1999by is one of the most sub - luminous sne ia ( bonanos et al . , 1999 ) . note that this spectroscopic @xmath8 is not suitable for describing the multi - color light curve of sn  1999by , which requires @xmath31 .",
    "the light curve decline parameter , @xmath32 , is also indicative of the low luminosity ( bonanos et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "radial velocities were inferred from the absorption minima of the 6150   si  ii trough ( fitted by a low - order polynomial around minimum ) .",
    "table 1 lists the resulted radial velocities , corrected for the host galaxy center recession velocity @xmath33 kms@xmath23 ( as given in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) . as the anonymous referee pointed out",
    ", sn  1999by was closer to the edge of ngc  2841 and could have significant orbital velocity in addition to the center - of - galaxy radial velocity .",
    "the rotation velocity of ngc  2841 at distances greater than 10 kpc from its center is @xmath34 kms@xmath23 ( sofue et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "thus , the uncertainty of the radial velocities is at least @xmath35 300 kms@xmath23 due to the possible orbital velocity as well as the large width of the si  ii line .",
    "nevertheless , this uncertainty is only a few percent of the si  ii expansion velocity .",
    "fig.3 compares the radial velocities of sn  1999by with those of sn  1998aq ( vink et al.,1999 ) and sn  1994d ( patat et al.,1996 ) .",
    "the decline of the radial velocities of sn  1999by is much stronger than in the other two cases .",
    "sn  1991bg showed similar behavior ( filippenko et al.,1992 ) , while the other sub - luminous sne ia were not well covered spectroscopically around maximum .",
    "the stronger velocity decline is also in good agreement with the recent result of hatano et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that sub - luminous events have lower velocities at 10 days after maximum than do normal sne  ia .",
    "this may support the hypothesis that sub - luminous sne ia arise from sub - chandrasekhar mass progenitors , thus have less energetic explosion than normal type ia events ( see modjaz et al .",
    ", 2000 for recent review of explosion models ) .",
    "application of the multi - color light curve shape ( mlcs ) method for sn  1999by has been published very recently by tth & szab ( 2000 ) .",
    "they used only the @xmath36 light curve for template fitting and @xmath17 data for the reddening determination , and revealed @xmath37 mag .",
    "this may indicate that sn  1999by is extremely sub - luminous .",
    "for example , sn  1991bg , the prototype , had @xmath38 ( riess , press & kirshner , 1996 ) which is known as one of the least luminous sne ia to date .",
    "we re - analysed the @xmath39 photometric dataset published by tth & szab ( 2000 ) supplemented by the data of hanzl ( 1999 ) using the original mlcs template curves of riess , press & kirshner ( 1996 ) .",
    "because the photometric data are inhomogeneous , systematic errors may distort the parameters derived from them .",
    "thus , the results below can be considered only as crude estimates .",
    "although riess et al .",
    "( 1998a ) developed a second version of mlcs ( mlcs-2 , based on an extended list of calibrating sne ) , the updated template vectors have not been published yet . however , recently vink et al .",
    "( 2001 ) demonstrated that for nearby sne , even with moderate reddening , the mlcs-1 and mlcs-2 methods produce consistent results , if the maximum magnitude of the fiducial ( @xmath40 ) light curve is set properly .",
    "we adopted @xmath41 mag for the fiducial @xmath36 light curve ( riess , personal communication ) , while the original mlcs-1 method was based on @xmath42 mag .",
    "the difference has been taken into account by adding @xmath43 mag to the distance modulus computed with mlcs-1 .    for sn  1999by , @xmath44 was adopted , consistent with the all - sky reddening map of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( tth & szab derived @xmath45 from their sn photometry ) .",
    "the template vectors were fitted simultaneously to all @xmath39 data , i.e. the residual of all data were combined in a single @xmath46-function .",
    "the fitting was restricted for @xmath47 days , because the available pre - maximum data of sn  1999by could not be adequately fitted together with the post - maximum data ( see also tth & szab , 2000 ) .",
    "also , the minimum photometric error was increased to @xmath48 mag taking into account some possible systematic uncertainties in the used dataset ( due to e.g. errors in the standard transformation ) .",
    "the simultaneous fitting of the template curves resulted in @xmath49 and @xmath50 mag for the luminosity parameter and the reddening - free distance modulus , respectively .",
    "the given uncertainty of the distance modulus is only the rms error of the fitting , disregarding the possible systematic errors in the absolute magnitudes of the template light curves .",
    "the quality of the fit can be judged from fig.4 .",
    "it is seen that the fitting is not perfect , however , we believe that this is close the optimal result that can be achieved from the present datasets .",
    "the minimum of the reduced chi - squared that could be reached was @xmath51 .",
    "still , the solution may be systematically incorrect , because for such under - luminous sn the template vectors in mlcs-1 are based only on the light curves of sn  1991bg , and the light variation of sn  1999by may differ substantially from that .",
    "the large deviation of the pre - maximum points may be due to such inconsistence .",
    "also , photometric errors higher than we adopted ( @xmath48 mag ) can not be ruled out .",
    "the photometric @xmath8 is significantly higher than the value found from spectroscopy ( @xmath52 , sect.3 ) .",
    "it was not possible to reach an adequate fit with @xmath53 given by spectroscopy .",
    "thus , the current spectroscopic determination of @xmath8 does not give a suitable result for sn  1999by , which is probably true for other extreme sub - luminous sne  ia as well .",
    "an improved @xmath1(siii ) @xmath5 @xmath8 calibration is presented in the next section .",
    "although sub - luminous sne ia are usually eliminated from the sample of `` good '' distance indicators , the mlcs method gives information on their distances as well .",
    "the new distance modulus of sn  1999by given above corresponds to @xmath54 mpc geometric distance , which is significantly higher than @xmath55 mpc given by tth & szab ( 2000 ) and tully ( 1988 ) .",
    "note that the template vectors of the mlcs-1 method were calibrated from a training set of sne adopting tully - fisher- and surface - brightness - fluctuation distances , but the final absolute magnitudes were shifted to match the cepheid - based distance scale ( riess , press & kirshner , 1996 ) . thus , the higher distance given above simply reflects the difference between various distance scales , and may still contain a systematic error .",
    "both cepheid- and tully - fisher distances undergo significant revisions nowadays ( e.g. gibson et al .",
    ", 2000 , sakai et al . , 2000 ) , so this question can be answered only when the problems of the different distance scales are solved .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of sne ia correlate with @xmath1(siii ) as was presented very clearly by nugent et al .",
    "although hatano et al .",
    "( 2000 ) demonstrated that this correlation is not a one - parameter sequence , the dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath1(siii ) may still be a somewhat useful relation for predicting sne luminosities from spectra observed around maximum ( at least as a first approximation ) .",
    "now the correlation can be slightly improved using the new data of sub - luminous sne ia .",

    "these are listed in table 2 . because @xmath8 measures the deviation of the @xmath36 light curve of a particular sn from the fiducial sn  ia light curve at maximum , it is also directly proportional to the maximum absolute magnitude @xmath56 .",
    "however , at present , @xmath8 seems to be a more useful parameter than @xmath56 , because it is determined directly from the shape of the ( multi - color ) light curves , therefore it is not affected by the adopted zero - point of the distance scale .",

    "such prediction may be useful , for example , in the `` snapshot '' distance estimate method ( riess et al .",
    ", 1998b ) when only a few nights data are available for a particular sn .    from fig.5 , it may also be interesting that the most sub - luminous sn  1991bg , sn  1997cn and sn  1999by represent a small group with very consistent line - depth ratio and @xmath8 ( or absolute magnitude ) .",
    "it may mean that sub - luminous sne ia might be better distance indicators than previously thought , if their sub - luminous status is properly identified from spectroscopy and their difference from normal sne ia is taken into account .",
    "it is known ( e.g. hamuy et al . ,",
    "1994 ) that such sub - luminous sne ia may be more frequent events than their discovery rate suggests , thus , it is possible that many more such objects will be detected in the extensive supernova - search programs .",
    "however , the present sample is obviously too small to draw a certain conclusion .",
    "the results of this paper can be summarized as follows :    three spectra of the sub - luminous type ia sn  1999by around maximum were obtained at ddo , centered on the si  ii trough at 6150  .",
    "the @xmath1(siii ) line depth ratio ( nugent et al . , 1995 ) is determined to be 0.63 at maximum , indicative of an intrinsically sub - luminous sne ia .",
    "radial velocities of the 6150   si  ii line were determined from measuring the doppler - shift of the line core .",
    "it is shown that sn  1999by exhibited stronger decline of its radial velocity curve than other , spectroscopically normal sne ia .",
    "this may support the low - energy , sub - chandrasekhar mass explosion proposed for such sne .    absolute magnitude and distance of sn  1999by have been derived via the mlcs method .",
