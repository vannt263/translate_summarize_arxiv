    "in the classical black - scholes - merton ( bsm ) european option pricing model ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , asset processes are assumed to be strictly diffusive in nature and characterized by a single ( log - normal ) volatility @xmath0 . in practice",
    ", no actual option market conforms with this framework , so to make the bsm formula work , practitioners are forced to make the volatility argument in this formula depend on option maturity @xmath1 and strike @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , it is common practice in virtually all option markets to maintain a strike- and maturity - dependent _ implied volatility surface _ , @xmath3 , such that a call option on an asset @xmath4 paying @xmath5 at expiration time @xmath6 has a time @xmath7 undiscounted price @xmath8 given by @xmath9where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the cumulative gaussian distribution function , and @xmath13here and below , as usual,@xmath14note that our version of the bsm formula assumes that the asset price @xmath4 is a risk - neutral martingale , an assumption that is easily relaxed or , in any case , justified if we consider @xmath4 a forward process . at time @xmath15 , the @xmath15-observable function @xmath3 can be implied ( with assistance of interpolation and extrapolation techniques ) from quoted call option prices at multiple maturities and strikes . for later use ,",
    "notice that the term @xmath16is known as the option s ( forward ) _ delta . _",
    "below we often use the time value of a call option defined as follows@xmath17or , equivalently,@xmath18    for future reference , it is convenient to introduce the following non - dimensional function @xmath19 of the annualized variance @xmath20 and log - strike @xmath21:@xmath22where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and,@xmath25 in the limiting cases we have@xmath26it is clear that@xmath27    in most real markets , the market implied volatility function @xmath28 differs very significantly from a constant , and may have considerable slope and convexity as a function of @xmath29 for both very small and very large values of @xmath30 . to understand and explain this phenomenon ,",
    "several alternative models have been proposed in the literature .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite among others . broadly speaking",
    ", the available approaches can be categorized as follows :    * local volatility ( lv ) models , where the instantaneous volatility @xmath0 of @xmath4 is a deterministic function of time and @xmath4 . *",
    "stochastic volatility ( sv ) models , where @xmath0 is a random variable , possibly correlated with @xmath4 . * jump models , where the process for @xmath4 is assumed to be a purely discontinuous jump - process . *",
    "universal volatility ( uv ) models , where local volatility , stochastic volatility , and jump processes are combined .",
    "full - blown uv models are rarely used in practice , and instead markets tend to converge around a simpler model that ultimately becomes a _ de facto _ market standard .",
    "for instance , lv models are popular in the field of equity derivatives , and jump - free combinations of lv and sv ( known as lsv , or local - stochastic volatility , models ) are dominant in the fx options arena .",
    "such usage of simplified models is , however , rarely motivated by empirical facts , but instead are done for practical reasons in recognition of the fact that models that combine lv , sv , and jumps are often highly complicated to calibrate and implement .",
    "one particularly thorny issue is the question of how precisely to mix lv , sv , and jumps , a problem that is made especially vexing by the fact that even a simple model like lv can , on its own , match essentially any arbitrage - free option volatility surface ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in uv models",
    ", there are several potential strategies for attacking the mixing  problem . as lv , sv , and",
    "jumps give rise to different dynamic evolution of the volatility surface over time , one idea is to embed observations of the volatility dynamics into the model calibration problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "a closely related approach is to incorporate market - observable exotic option prices that are sensitive to the evolution of volatility , e.g. variance options , barrier options , and similar ; this approach is commonly used in fx markets to mix lv and sv into an lsv model .",
    "yet another idea is to examine various extremes of the volatility surface ( short maturity , long maturity , large strikes , small strikes ) and attempt to understand which type of model feature ( sv / lv / jumps ) will control the asymptotic model behavior most strongly and most naturally .",
    "this information , in turn , could then be used to inspire the model building process . to give an example , consider that the convexity of @xmath28 around @xmath31 can often be observed to be substantially higher for small option maturities than for larger ones@xmath32 a pure lv model would model this by letting the convexity ( in @xmath4 ) of the local volatility function decay rapidly as a function of time .",
    "such a model would , however , be highly non - stationary , an undesirable model feature that can be avoided by introducing jumps or ( mean - reverting ) stochastic volatility .",
    "the idea of considering volatility function asymptotics is particularly attractive from an analytical perspective , as one can often work out simple closed - form expressions for these asymptotics , even for complex models .",
    "for sv , lv , and lsv models the procedure for generating such asymptotics is well - understood ( see e.g. @xcite for a survey of recent results ) , and the range of validity for the resulting expansions has been examined closely , generally with fairly satisfying results . recently ,",
    "similar attempts have been undertaken for jump processes , especially for processes in the so - called _ exponential lvy class_. more precisely , these models write @xmath33where @xmath34 is a lvy process . in this setup , particular emphasis has been put on the small - time asymptotic of @xmath8 for @xmath35 and @xmath29 fixed at some level different from @xmath36 , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , lopez et al among many others . a typical result in this area of research",
    "is that @xmath37where @xmath38 indicates the leading order term as @xmath39 . for this relation to be true ,",
    "the corresponding implied volatility must explode in the short - time limit .",
    "this line of research is closely related in studying small time asymptotics for the densities of lvy processes , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "small - time results for at - the - money ( atm ) options where @xmath31 are scarcer , but in carr - wu-1 tanaka s formula is used to demonstrate that @xmath40when @xmath41 is a mixed jump - diffusion consisting of a brownian motion with volatility @xmath0 and a finite variation for a definition of various attributes of levy processes . ] lvy jump process .",
    "@xcite further elaborates on this result in implied volatility space , and demonstrates that for a finite variation lvy process ( necessarily without a diffusion component ) @xmath42where @xmath43 is the lvy measure of @xmath44 in the presence of a diffusion component with constant volatility @xmath0 , @xcite shows that if @xmath45then @xmath46for @xmath39 .",
    "other relevant papers about short - time option prices in models with jumps include @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    as for long - maturity and extreme strike asymptotics ,",
    "the literature is generally quite sparse . under mild regularity conditions , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite use large deviation principles to demonstrate that the implied volatility surface will always flatten out for large enough maturities and finite strikes , irrespective of the underlying process assumptions , which agrees with earlier observations by @xcite . for exponentiated lvy processes ,",
    "the authors list explicit formulas tying the long - time volatility asymptote to moments of @xmath4 .",
    "extreme strike asymptotics for the specific case of lvy processes follow from the moment formulas of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and gulisashvili1 ; see @xcite for a brief discussion .",
    "overall , while some progress has been made in recent years , the available asymptotic results for jump processes are limited when compared to the literature for lv and sv diffusion processes .",
    "in particular , little is known about the range of validity of jump process asymptotics , in part due to the difficulty of establishing accurate numerical option prices for lvy processes , especially in the short - time limit . in this paper , we add to the literature in several ways . first and foremost , we completely characterize the @xmath30 and @xmath29 volatility surface asymptotes for the important class of ( exponentiated ) tempered stable lvy processes , with and without a diffusive component .",
    "in addition , we also list a number of asymptotic expansions for the merton jump - diffusion and the nig ( normal inverse gaussian ) process .",
    "note that our results cover not only the level of the volatility surface , but also its slope and convexity  properties that are highly relevant when calibrating a model to observed option prices . ] .",
    "we mainly work in fourier space using the lewis - lipton call option representation @xcite , lipton-2 , and our primary tools for asymptotic expansion are the dominated convergence theorem ( for the short - time limits ) and classical complex variable techniques , such as the saddlepoint theorem ( for long - dated options ) and high - frequency fourier asymptotics ( for large and small strike limits ) .",
    "for testing and illustration purposes , we present several closed - form option prices for special cases of the tempered stable lvy process , and also list some results for the computation of green s function .",
    "further , we draw attention to the applicability of _ fractional differentiation _ in characterizing the pide ( partial integro - differential equation ) that governs option prices in the tempered stable model class ; these results allows one to draw on modern numerical algorithms when pricing both vanilla and exotic options . as an example",
    ", we develop an operator splitting method which is @xmath47 complex and second order accurate in time and space .",
    "the idea is to split jumps into positive and negative and treat them separately on each step ; the problem then boils down to the inversion of hessenberg matrices which may be accomplished via the generalized thomas algorithm in @xmath47 operations .",
    "a regular diffusion can be added as an additional iteration , as needed .",
    "to test and motivate our asymptotic results , our primary focus in this paper is on fx options markets .",
    "these markets are of interest to us for two reasons : i ) very short - dated options actively trade in this market ( it is not uncommon for dealers to quote on options with a maturity being just a few hours ) ; and ii ) volatility quoting conventions in these markets use the option delta @xmath48 ( see ( [ eq : delta ] ) ) , rather than the strike @xmath29 . at first glance",
    "the delta quotation standard may appear to be a nuisance , since additional translation from the delta space into the strike space is needed , but on second thought it becomes apparent that this construct has deep mathematical roots . specifically , quoting volatility as a function of delta",
    "is closely related to the so - called _ resolution of singularities _",
    "frequently used in algebraic geometry and other mathematical disciplines ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our tests disprove a number of urban myths  about lvy process asymptotics , especially regarding the range of applicability of short- and long - time asymptotics .    our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ fxmarket ] provides a very brief introduction to fx volatility quotation standards , and introduce the concepts of risk reversals and straddles ( also known as butterflies ) .",
    "we examine some representative market data for implied volatility , and highlight how the short - dated asymptotics are unnatural in a diffusion setting .",
    "section [ elps ] gives an overview of lvy processes , with an emphasis on the tempered stable class and the fractional derivative representation of the corresponding option pricing equation .",

    "section [ llformula ] introduces the lewis - lipton formula which is the main working tool for establishing all our asymptotic results .",
    "it also discusses calibration of the corresponding stochastic processes to market data introduced in section [ fxmarket ] .",
    "section [ bsasymptotics ] discusses the asymptotic behavior of the bsm formula which is used subsequently in order to analyze the behavior of implied volatility .",

    "[ asymptoticsshort ] , [ asymptoticswing ] also contain a series of numerical tests aimed at establishing their practical relevance .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "appendices contain some of the more elaborate proofs and other useful material .",
    "the fx options market is one of the largest over - the - counter options markets in the world , yet its conventions are quite idiosyncratic and differ markedly from those used in other derivatives markets ( e.g. , interest rates and equities ) .",
    "moreover , almost every concept of importance can be interpreted differently , often depending on the currency pair in question , which makes systematic analysis and comparison of fx options particularly difficult .",
    "there are both historical and financial reasons for the existence of fx quotation styles , the most obvious being that fx  transactions , unlike many other financial transactions , are inherently symmetric in nature , in the sense that units of currency are exchanged into units of currency ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in fx markets ,",
    "it is standard practice to represent the volatility smile in terms of the option delta , rather than in terms of the option strike .",
    "we may define @xmath49where @xmath48 is the delta defined in ( [ eq : delta ] ) .",
    "the map between @xmath48 and @xmath29 is monotonic , so ( [ eq : sigma_delta ] ) is always well - defined .",
    "we should note that several other definitions of delta than ( [ eq : delta ] ) exist in the fx market , not all of which are monotonic in strike is not mononic in @xmath29 . ] ; for our purposes , we ignore this complication and just refer to @xcite and @xcite , among many other sources , for additional information on various delta definitions .    in the fx options markets , the function @xmath50 is normally liquidly quoted at only three different levels of delta : 0.25 , 0.50 , and 0.75 .",

    "while some of the technical results in this paper are known , many existing results in the literature have been derived using a variety of ( often complex ) methods , and our paper provides a clean unification of these results along with a variety of new formulas . generally speaking these results are theoretically appealing and provide definitive answers to a number of questions , e.g. whether non - zero limits for fx risk reversals and butterflies exist for the processes in question .    in order to establish the practical relevance for the various asymptotic results ,",
    "we have taken substantial time to undertake numerical comparisons of asymptotics against the exact ll solution .",
    "the difficulty of this task should not be underestimated as the integrals in the exact ll representation become challenging to handle numerically in the various limits .",
    "nevertheless , once the analysis is carried out , it becomes clear that the performance of the various asymptotics are definitely a mixed bag , and overall rather disappointing .",
    "for instance , it is clear that most wing ( i.e. large - strike ) asymptotics have domains of validity that are exceedingly small , rendering the results mostly useless in practice .",
    "the same holds for small - time asymptotics of implied volatility for elps , where maturities generally need to be much less than a day for the asymptotics to be accurate .",
    "on the other hand , small - time asymptotics work well for diffusion processes with local and stochastic volatility , where it is not uncommon to find that options with maturities of several years can be successfully studied in the short - time limit .",
    "this discrepancy of performance is perhaps understandable given that elps ( with jumps ) are fundamentally different from diffusions , especially when observed at small time scales .    for elps , what does seem to work reasonable well in many case are the long - term asymptotics where the domain of validity is often respectably large ( say , covering maturities larger than one or two years ) .",
    "unfortunately , this behavior is neither universal nor particularly robust , and it is not difficult to find examples of elp configurations which , while matching the market well , result in poor long - term asymptotics .",
    "for instance , we have observed that for tempered @xmath145-stable processes the region of validity of the long - term asymptotics is sometimes dramatically reduced when the parameter @xmath145 is greater than one .    in summary , while elps are viable candidates for describing fx market dynamic , it is relatively difficult to analyze their behavior in pertinent asymptotic regimes . in order to accomplish this task successfully",
