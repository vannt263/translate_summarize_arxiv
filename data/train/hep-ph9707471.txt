    "<S> the concept of qcd colour flow has been an interesting prediction , and hence test , of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> one of the more surprising examples of qcd colour flow has been the rapidity gaps seen at hera @xcite . in the majority of jet events </S>",
    "<S> observed at hera the incoming electron / positron radiates a photon , which scatters off one of the coloured constituents of the proton , to produce the observed jet . </S>",
    "<S> this hard scattering leaves the proton remnant and the pre - jet in a non colour singlet state , during hadronization the colour of these objects is rearranged to form colourless hadrons , and these hadrons fill the gap between the produced jet and the proton remnant with an underlying event . </S>",
    "<S> however among the hera events are some with an observed jet produced at central rapidities ; but with no hadrons between the jet and proton remnant direction ; _ i.e. _ there is no underlying event , and this means that the mechanism for producing this jet can not be that just described . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of hadrons between the observed jet and the proton remnant means that there is no qcd colour is exchanged between the proton and the photon , and hence that photon must have scattered off a colour singlet object in the proton , the pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> so the flow of hadrons in an event has told us something about the structure of the proton , that the struck object inside the proton that took part in the hard scattering is a qcd colour singlet .    this ability to probe </S>",
    "<S> the qcd colour of the object that takes part in the hard scattering is , in the future , likely to provide a strong experimental probe . </S>",
    "<S> a prime example is in the detection of a heavy ( @xmath1 gev ) higgs boson at the lhc , such a higgs is produced via two different mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> approximately two thirds of heavy higgs are produced from @xmath2 fusion via a top quark loop , with the remaining third produced via vector boson fusion , show in fig.[fig : wwh]a . </S>",
    "<S> such a heavy higgs typically decays into two massive vector bosons , either @xmath3 or @xmath4 bosons , and the back ground from continuum diboson production , shown in fig.[fig : wwh]b , can be large . </S>",
    "<S> however the qcd colour flow in the diboson fusion signal process is very different from the background continuum diboson production , the leading colour flow is shown in fig.[fig : wwh ] as a dotted line . for the diboson fusion process </S>",
    "<S> qcd colour flows between the proton remnant and the parton that emits the vector boson , this parton travels in very much the same direction as the proton remnant . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the hadrons associated with the underlying event will travel in a similar direction to the proton remnant , i.e. at very large rapidities . for the diboson continuum background ( as well as the higgs signal from @xmath2 fusion ) qcd colour </S>",
    "<S> is exchanged between the two protons , and this means that the underlying event will produce hadrons at all rapidities . </S>",
    "<S> this difference in the flow of hadrons gives us a method of separating the vector boson fusion higgs signal from the continuum background , effectively the higgs signal has a double rapidity gap on both sides of the event , with the higgs decay taking place at central rapidities @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however this method for separating signal from background by the flow of hadrons has many difficulties . on the theoretical side </S>",
    "<S> we make predictions and the rate of the signal and background based upon perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) . </S>",
    "<S> pqcd s fundamental fields are partons ( quarks and gluons ) and it is about these fields that pqcd makes predictions . by local parton hadron duality we expect that the produced partons will hadronize into jets ; however this tells us nothing about individual hadrons and it is in terms of individual hadrons that rapidity gaps are defined . </S>",
    "<S> this means that we can make no absolute predictions based upon pqcd of the signal rate of events where a rapidity gap is observed , or indeed the background rate where a fluctuation leads to an observed rapidity gap , despite qcd colour being exchanged between the protons . on the experimental side the cross section for higgs productions drops very rapidly as the higgs gets heavy , and for very heavy higgs the cross section is small enough that it is only with very high luminosities that we produce any higgs events at all . </S>",
    "<S> however at very high luminosities there are likely to be many interactions per bunch crossing , and each of these interactions will produce its own underlying event , which will wash out the rapidity gap at central rapidities .    </S>",
    "<S> one possible solution to these problems is rather that look for events with a rapidity gap , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ no hadrons at central rapidities , instead to look for events with no soft `` minijets '' at central rapidities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> naively we expect additional jets to be suppressed by a factor of @xmath5 , however there can often be a large volume of phase space in which additional jets can be radiated , and this can enhance the additional jet rate by a large logarithm such that multijet emission is not suppressed . in particular jet emission that is soft with respect to the hard scattering </S>",
    "<S> is enhanced by such a large logarithm . if we define soft jets in such a way that the background divector boson continuum ( which has more qcd colour acceleration , and hence more jet activity ) typically has additional jet emission , while the vector boson fusion signal ( with less qcd colour accelerated ) typically has no additional jet activity ; then the difficulties with using hadrons to define a rapidity gap are overcome . additional soft jet production </S>",
    "<S> we expect to be predictable by pqcd as long as the scale for soft jet emission is far above @xmath0 . on the experimental side </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the majority of interactions will be very soft , and although producing an underlying event the majority of interactions will not produce observed jets , and so not interfere with tagging a higgs signal event . </S>",
    "<S> this means that firm theoretical predictions can , in principle , be made about a minijet tag of a higgs signal , and that a minijet tag can be used at high luminosities where there are overlapping events .    however before we can use minijet emission as a probe of qcd colour charge it is necessary to understand minijet emission both on a theoretical and experimental level . in order for multiple jet emission to be important </S>",
    "<S> we need a large phase space for emission of those jets , and this means that we require the hard scattering to be as energetic as possible . </S>",
    "<S> currently the most energetic events are to be found at the tevatron , and cdf have studied the multijet distributions in there most energetic events @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they apply the cuts , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the scattering angle of the highest @xmath8 jet in the multijet centre of mass frame . due to the high invariant mass of these events </S>",
    "<S> the events are forced to be fairly central , and this means that at least two jets are always observed . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mult ] we show the multiplicity distribution observed in the cdf events , although 3rd and additional jets are naively produced at a higher order in perturbation theory because of the large volume of phase space such additional jet activity is not suppressed , with typical events with 3 or 4 jets observed .    </S>",
    "<S> the high multiplicity of these events means that pqcd in its lowest order is not not reliable . </S>",
    "<S> the large logs that give rise to the high multiplicity need to be dealt with in the theoretical calculation . </S>",
    "<S> now most of the additional jet activity takes place at low @xmath8 , and these soft jets typically originate from gluons . </S>",
    "<S> now for soft gluons the matrix element factorises , the probability to radiate @xmath9 additional soft gluons is given by , @xmath10 the phase space to radiate @xmath9 additional gluons is given by , @xmath11 where the @xmath12 term arises from the symmetry factor for integrating @xmath9 gluons over the same phase space . </S>",
    "<S> now if @xmath13 , that is we make no experimental requirements about the observed properties of the gluons , then in moment space we find , @xmath14 this means that the probability to see @xmath9 gluon jets is given by , @xmath15 and so , @xmath16 however for the case of jets defined by the cdf algorithm @xmath17 , also not all jets are soft , and not all jets are gluon initiated . </S>",
    "<S> this means that this simple factorisation of the additional jet rate does not hold , however it is a reasonable ansatz to assume equation [ eq : atz ] .    </S>",
    "<S> this is not the full story though , equation [ eq : atz ] does not conserve probability , this happens because the rate to radiate an addition gluon @xmath18 is an inclusive quantity , whereas if we are to make predictions about the specific multiplicity distributions then we require the exclusive rate to produce _ exactly _ @xmath9 additional jets . </S>",
    "<S> we can obtain the exclusive jet rate by adding a sudakov suppression factor @xmath19 @xcite that excludes all additional jet activity , and then equation [ eq : atz ] produces exactly @xmath9 exclusive jets . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the ansatz for additional jet activity over the hard scattering as , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the average multiplicity @xmath22 , and at the leading logarithmic level is given by , @xmath23 this formula has the advantage over strictly tree level pqcd of being still valid even when @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> also we have , @xmath25 and so the 3 jet cross section has the same accuracy as at leading order .    if we compare equation [ eq : satz ] with the measured cdf multiplicity distribution , fitting only @xmath26 to the observed average excess multiplicity over the 2 hard jets always observed we find the curve shown in figure [ fig : mult ] . </S>",
    "<S> although the point for multiplicity 4 is 3.5 standard deviations above the fitted curve , and thus the equation [ eq : satz ] has limitations , it is clear that the fit has got the gist of the multiplicity distribution correct and gives a place to start when studying event multiplicities , and hence the physics of minijets .    </S>",
    "<S> if we now try to predict the value for @xmath26 from pqcd using equation [ eq : pfit ] with a tree level calculation for @xmath27 and a next - to - leading - order calculation for @xmath28 @xcite then we find the results shown in figure [ fig : nbar ] plotted against the minimum @xmath8 used to define a jet @xcite .    for the leading order calculation of @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> we have several different choices of scale . </S>",
    "<S> for the renormalisation scale of @xmath5 ; this can either be some multiple of the hard scattering scale , @xmath29 , or some multiple of the soft scale at which the jet is emitted @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> for the factorisation scale at which the parton densities are evaluated we similarly can choose a hard scale related to @xmath29 , if we feel we should sum up the initial state radiation , or a soft scale related to @xmath30 if we feel that explicitly calculating high order emission in @xmath27 means that we should only generate higher order corrections bellow that scale . </S>",
    "<S> a case can be made for each of these choices , and from figure [ fig : nbar ] we can see the prediction for @xmath22 changes by a factor of 3 for the experimental value of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this happens because we have two natural scales in the calculation of @xmath27 the hard scattering scale , and the @xmath8 of the emisson , and as these have very different values the predictions for @xmath22 vary accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical predictions for @xmath22 span the experimental measurement , but we can not make an accurate theoretical predition at this time .    without improvements to the theoretical predictions </S>",
    "<S> we do not currently have the ability to accurately predict the rate of minijet emission , and this means that we do not currently have the technology to use minijets as a absolute theoretical prediction to probe qcd colour charge . on the theoretical side </S>",
    "<S> the large scale dependence of @xmath27 can be cured by working at higher order in perturbation theory @xcite ; however this would necessitate an improvement in the simple minijet model , equation [ eq : satz ] , which is non consistent we such a higher order calculation . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively it may be possible to show which logarithmic terms need to be resummed in order to remove the large scale dependence , without a full calculation of the higher order finite corrections . </S>",
    "<S> in addition equation [ eq : satz ] does not take advantage of our knowledge of the tree level rate for high jet multiplicities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly there is much theoretical work that remains to be done . </S>",
    "<S> there is also much work to be done on the experimental side to help our understanding of minijets , for example the different theoretical scale choices not only affect the average multiplicity , but also affect the shape of distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in figure [ fig : nbar ] where a renormalisation scale related to the @xmath8 of the emitted jet has the average multiplicity growing far more rapidly as the @xmath8 cut used to define a jet is decreased , than a harder renormalisation scale . if the experimenter were able to measure this distribution then this information can be used to motivate different choices for the scale choice . </S>"
