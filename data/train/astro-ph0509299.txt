    "nearly ten years after the discovery of the first gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglow in the optical / near - infrared @xcite , the progress in the understanding of the grb phenomenon is enormous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from the observational point of view",
    "nearly every individual afterglow has turned out to be specific in some sense .",
    "the richness in afterglow properties observed so far is not much surprising , however , given the fact that the afterglow phenomenon combines internal properties of the underlying burster population with properties of the external circumburster medium .",
    "this in combination with redshift provides a large parameter space for various flavors of grb afterglows .",
    "however , in spite of their individualities , as an ensemble afterglows trace the underlying physical boundary conditions and the parameter space of the physical processes involved . revealing this parameter space is of fundamental interest since it might much improve the understanding of the afterglow phenomenon .",
    "this has already motivated several groups to perform a systematic analysis of observational data from various afterglows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the present work continues this kind of investigations but concentrates on the optical / nir bands .    while a fit of the observed broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of an afterglow from the radio to the x - ray band is the best way in order to extract the underlying physical parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one might expect that the optical / nir data alone are completely explainable within the context of the underlying theoretical model .",
    "in particular , in most cases it is the optical / nir region where the sampling and the quality of the afterglow data is best .",
    "it is clear that any reliable theoretical model must be able to explain the observed richness in the phenomenology of optical light curves of grb afterglows . in this respect",
    "it is worth summarizing and exploring the available data base on afterglows in the optical / nir bands .",
    "this holds in particular with respect to the new era in grb research initiated by the launch and operation of the _ swift _ satellite @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we continue our systematic analysis of afterglow parameters based on optical and near - infrared data ( zeh , klose , & hartmann 2004 , hereafter paper i ; zeh , klose , & hartmann 2005 ) .",
    "our study includes @xmath0 afterglows in the pre-_swift _ era with sufficient published data . while in paper i we analyzed the afterglow light curves with special emphasis on an underlying supernova component , the goal of the present paper is to explore the parameter space of the light curve parameters and of physical quantities related to them . in paper iii @xcite ,",
    "we expand this analysis to the spectral energy distribution of afterglows in the optical and near - infrared bands in order to search for signatures of dust in grb host galaxies .",
    "we collected from the literature all available photometric data on grb afterglows observed by the end of 2004 and checked them for consistency .",
    "we modeled the light curve of the optical transient ( ot ) following a grb as a composite of genuine afterglow light , supernova ( sn ) light , and constant light from the underlying host galaxy .",
    "the afterglow is either modeled by a single or a smoothly broken double power - law according to @xcite .",
    "our fitting procedure is based on a @xmath1 minimization with a levenberg - marquardt iteration .",
    "this minimization technique provides formal uncertainties of the fitted parameters through the covariance matrix . for the remainder of this paper ,",
    "all uncertainties are 1@xmath2    we always fitted photometric magnitudes with a fitting equation as follows : @xmath3^{-1/n } \\nonumber \\\\                & + & k\\,10^{-0.4\\,m_{\\rm sn}(t / s ) } + 10^{-0.4\\,m_{\\rm host}}\\}\\ , .",
    "\\label{mag1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameters in equation  ( [ mag1 ] ) are the prebreak decay slope @xmath4 , the postbreak decay slope @xmath5 , the break time @xmath6 , the steepness of the break @xmath7 , the brightness of the host galaxy @xmath8 , the constant @xmath9 which corresponds to the magnitude of the fitted light curve for the case @xmath10 at the break time @xmath6 ( it stands for the intersection point of the prebreak and the postbreak slope , without considering a smooth transition ) , as well as the supernova parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which indicate the luminosity ratio and the stretch factor normalized to sn 1998bw ( cf .",
    "paper i ) .",
    "if there is no break in the light curve , then equation  ( [ mag1 ] ) reduces to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the brightness of the afterglow at @xmath15 day after the burst . before the fitting process",
    "the data were corrected for galactic extinction using the maps of @xcite . for a more detailed description of our procedure",
    "we refer to paper i.    in the present paper , our input list contains 59 optical / nir afterglows observed in the pre-_swift _ era which allowed us to perform a fit ( table  [ tabres ] ) .",
    "sixteen of these have a well - sampled light curve in at least one photometric band ( mostly the @xmath16 band ) .",
    "these light curves show a well - detectable break and have sufficient data points before and after the break time , so that the prebreak decay slope and the postbreak decay slope according to equation ( [ mag1 ] ) are well - defined .",
    "more precisely , our selection criterium for the best - defined afterglow light curves is that the @xmath17 error is less than 0.2 for @xmath4 , less than 0.3 for @xmath5 , and less than 1 day for @xmath18 ( table  [ tabres ] ) .",
    "we did not use the accuracy of the fit ( @xmath1 per degrees of freedom ) as a selection criterium , however .",
    "we consider equation ( [ mag1 ] ) as an empirical first order approximation of an observed light curve and all deviations from the corresponding fit as fine structure (   [ fines ] ) .",
    "light curves with no break are by definition excluded from this sample of best - defined afterglows , because it can not be ascertained with complete certainty if the slope is a pre- or postbreak .",
    "whenever we did not detect a break , the data quality was usually insufficient to exclude the possibility of a jet break in the light curve . in these cases",
    "there is either no early time data available , or the break could have been missed because of a bright host galaxy or an underlying sn component .",
    "all but one ( grb 980519 ) of the 16 afterglows in our sample have a known redshift , none of these bursts is classified as an x - ray flash kev . ] .",
    "for the present study the afterglows of grb 021004 and grb 030329 were excluded from our analysis because of their many rebrightening episodes ( see also   [ fines ] ) . in the case of the afterglow of grb 030329 , we performed two additional fits that are also given in table [ tabres ] , the details are in appendix [ individual ] .",
    "while these fits give very good results , they are based on only a small part of the light curve and we thus do not include their results in the selected sample for statistical study , with the exception of figure [ a1n ] .",
    "the afterglow of grb 000301c also shows a rebrightening episode ( around 3.5 days after the burst ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but as the deviations are not that large and occur only during a certain period , the light curve can still be fitted with a broken power - law , even though @xmath19 becomes relatively large .",
    "a special note is required for grb 021211 .",
    "the afterglow light curve of this burst fulfills the aforementioned criteria for the amount of the @xmath17 error bars of the fit parameters , nevertheless we have not included it in our subsample of well - defined light curves .",
    "according to our data , the light curve shows a break 0.11@xmath200.09 days after the burst with a steepening by @xmath21 .",
    "this is in close agreement with the amount of steepening expected for the passage of the cooling break across the optical window ( for a compton parameter less than 1 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , @xcite report on evidence for color changes of the afterglow just around this time . given the fact that no optical data have been reported in the literature for the time period between 1 and 10 days after the burst",
    ", we consider it as very likely that the break in the light curve we have found does indeed signal the passage of the cooling break ( as already suspected by * ? ? ?",
    "* based on their finding of color changes ) , while the real jet break occurred between 1 and 10 days after the burst .",
    "note that the light curve break around 0.11 days is not identical to the break discussed by others concerning the very early light curve , which has been attributed to the reverse shock @xcite . given these findings , and since we try to keep our subsample as homogeneous as possible , we have not included this burst in the following study .",
    "the light curve parameters we have deduced from our data might be slightly different to those obtained and used by other groups .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that we use a different , and most likely larger data base .",
    "in addition , there is still some bias in the selection of the data , in the definition of what are outliers , which data should be used and which data should not . while we do not claim that our data base is the best for every individual grb , most probably it is the most comprehensive set .",
    "the strength of our approach is that we analyze all afterglow light curves using the same numerical procedure . in this respect",
    "we are confident that the results we obtain are statistically robust .",
    "the results of our light curve fitting of the individual afterglows are summarized in table  [ tabres ] . here , the second column indicates the sample of the best - defined 16 afterglows . in some cases we could only derive upper or lower limits for some parameters , because the light curve was poorly sampled ( see   [ individual ] ) . in the following",
    "we discuss only the results obtained for this sample of 16 afterglows .",
    "the distributions of the deduced light curve parameters are shown in figures  [ a1histo ] to [ logtbz ] .",
    "the mean of the prebreak decay slope is @xmath22 , with @xmath4 ranging from @xmath23 ( grb 000301c ) to @xmath24 ( grb 011121 ) , while @xmath5 ranges from @xmath25 ( grb 041006 ) to @xmath26 ( grb 030429 ) with the mean at @xmath27 . about half of the postbreak decay slopes",
    "have @xmath28 .",
    "both distributions overlap in the interval from about 1.3 to 1.7 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath5 is almost constant , with a possible cutoff around 1.3 and no preference for any value .",
    "figure  [ dahisto ] displays the distribution of the difference of the decay slopes before and after the break , @xmath29 .",
    "the distribution is asymmetric with its maximum around 0.8 and a longer tail towards higher values .",
    "it is notably broader than the distribution of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it also indicates the possibility that some afterglows could have very shallow breaks with @xmath30 that could easily be missed .",
    "the gap around @xmath31 is probably due to low - number statistics and we do not consider it to be significant . in this respect",
    "we can not confirm the potential evidence for a bimodality of the distribution of @xmath32 @xcite , allthough we can not reject this possibility either .",
    "in figure  [ logtbz ] we present the distribution of the observed break times for the afterglows with the best - defined light curves , but translated into the corresponding grb host frame .",
    "this distribution is strongly asymmetric with a clear peak in the host frame at lower values around 0.3 days . that most breaks occur at relatively early times supports the view that in several cases ( table  [ tabres ] ) light curve breaks might have been missed due to a lack of early - time data .",
    "the afterglow with the earliest break in the host frame was grb 041006 , while the afterglow of grb 000301c had the latest break time .",
    "on the other hand , late breaks might have been missed in several cases too , because the afterglow was already too faint at the break time , and/or an underlying sn component or a bright host galaxy simply made the discovery of the break in the optical bands impossible .",
    "we conclude that these data indicate , even though they do not prove , that in fact all afterglow light curves have detectable breaks due to a collimated explosion , as long as they are not hidden by rebrightening episodes as in grb 030329 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is clear that any model that explains the observed light curve breaks must be able to reproduce this observed distribution ( figure  [ logtbz ] ) .",
    "the distribution of the shape parameter @xmath7 ( equation  [ mag1 ] ) is more difficult to quantify . while for about half of the afterglows the data allowed us to determine @xmath7 during the fitting procedure , in the other cases @xmath7 did not converge during the fit ( @xmath33 ) , because the sampling of the data is not good enough .",
    "it is worth noting that whenever we were able to determine @xmath7 , we obtained a relatively soft break ( @xmath34 ) and in each case the prebreak decay slope @xmath4 was very shallow . in the other cases we had to fix @xmath7 at a relatively large value in order to obtain an acceptable fit , and we chose @xmath35 . choosing @xmath34 made the fit worse . whether this indicates a possible bimodal distribution of the parameter @xmath7 is an open question .",
    "the distribution of the shape parameter @xmath7 is the biggest unknown , so far , including its theoretical interpretation .",
    "figure  [ a1a2 ] shows the correlation between the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 in comparison with eight standard afterglow models that cover the cases ( 1 ) @xmath36 , ( 2 ) @xmath37 , ( 3 ) @xmath38 , ( 4 ) @xmath39 for the ism and for the wind model , where @xmath40 is the observed frequency and @xmath41 is the compton parameter ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their eqs .",
    "21 , 22 and 29 ) .",
    "those models with @xmath36 and @xmath42 require @xmath43 in order to explain an observed @xmath44 .",
    "in particular , there is a group of five bursts ( grbs 990123 , 991216 , 010222 , 030328 , 041006 ) that cluster around @xmath45 . within the corresponding 1@xmath46 error",
    "bars @xmath47 is basically ruled out and so is @xmath48 .",
    "such shallow postbreak decay slopes can not be explained by a flat electron distribution either @xcite .",
    "based on the underlying theoretical models , which predict @xmath49 , then we find that the parameter space of @xmath50 is rather broad , ranging from about 1.5 to 3 .",
    "while the results obtained for @xmath50 for the individual afterglows differ among various authors , all studies agree that within the current theoretical framework no evidence for a universality of @xmath50 is found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; paper iii ) .",
    "this is contrary to what one might expect from theoretical models of highly relativistic shocks @xcite , and contrary to what one might prefer on theoretical grounds @xcite .",
    "if one allows for @xmath43 then an inspection of figure  [ a1a2 ] shows that a wind model with @xmath36 is preferred for grbs 980519 , 990123 , 991216 , 000926 , 020124 , 020405 , 030328 , and 041006 , even though grbs 990123 , 991216 and 000926 lie fairly off the models because of their relatively small @xmath5 or large @xmath4 . on the other hand , an ism model with @xmath51",
    "is preferred for grb 990510 and grb 011211 .",
    "grb 020813 is either an ism case with @xmath36 or an ism / wind case with @xmath52 , in the following , we will assume this to be an ism case .",
    "two afterglows ( grb 010222 and grb 011121 ) could be an ism or a wind case with @xmath52 . in the case of grb 011121 ,",
    "the error bars are so large that @xmath36 can not be fully excluded . finally , the afterglows of grbs 000301c , 030226 , and 030429 are outliers because of their relatively large @xmath5 .",
    "it is noteworthy that all afterglows with soft breaks in the light curve ( @xmath34 ) belong to the group of bursts that are less compatible with a wind profile , and all these afterglows have @xmath53 .",
    "it is difficult to quantify whether the outliers really represent a different population or whether in these cases the light curves are simply ill - defined .",
    "for example , the afterglow of grb 000301c was affected by a strong rebrightening episode that has been modeled by a gravitational microlensing event @xcite .",
    "as these authors note , the removal of this event leads to @xmath54 , which would shift grb 000301c toward the theoretical prediction of the ism model with @xmath36 . in the case of grb 030226",
    "there is evidence that the afterglow light curve showed fluctuations . in combination with the relatively sparse set of postbreak data it is well possible that the late - time observations stopped when the afterglow underwent a fluctuation , so that finally the deduced postbreak decay slope is too large .",
    "on the other hand , early - time spectra of this afterglow reveal features that can be best understood as due to a stellar wind profile @xcite . in the case of 030429 , @xcite find that the light curve undergoes a significant rebrightening around 1.7 days after the burst .",
    "they suggest to exclude the data around the rebrightening from the fit and fix @xmath55 ( deduced from the sed and the @xmath56 relations ) . in this case",
    "the light curve would be compatible with an ism / wind model and @xmath57 , although it is unclear how large the error in @xmath5 would be .",
    "if we neglect grbs 000301c , 030226 , and 030429 , then figure [ a1a2 ] shows that the group of optical afterglows that is compatible with a wind model is notably larger than the group of afterglows that prefers an ism model .",
    "while basically all studies in the literature agree that afterglows seem to separate into a group that can be best described by a wind model and a group that can be best described by an ism model , our data show that the wind scenario is statistically preferred .",
    "in fact , within their 1@xmath46 error bars nearly all @xmath58 pairs are compatible with a wind profile while for the ism model such a statement is clearly ruled out .",
    "figure  [ thetahisto ] displays the distribution of the jet half - opening angle , @xmath59 , for our sample of 16 bursts ( grb 980519 is not included as no redshift of this burst is known ) as derived from the observed break time , assuming the uniform jet model @xcite .",
    "we calculated @xmath59 following @xcite for an ism medium ( grbs 990510 , 000301c , 011211 , 020813 , 030226 , 030429 ) and @xcite for a wind - like medium ( grbs 990123 , 991216 , 000926 , 010222 , 011121 , 020124 , 020405 , 030328 , 041006 ) , according to the results obtained for the density profile of the individual afterglows (   [ profile ] ) .",
    "for the isotropic equivalent energy @xmath60 , the radiation efficiency and the redshift we adopted the values given by @xcite . in the case of an ism model we used the circumburster density as given in @xcite , while for the wind model we assumed a mass - loss rate to wind speed ratio of @xmath61 ( cf .",
    "the distribution of @xmath59 that we have found is strongly asymmetric with a peak between 2 and 5 degrees , has a lower cutoff around 2 degrees and rapidly falls towards larger angles , in agreement with what has been found in previous studies @xcite .      using the derived jet half - opening angles (   [ theta ] )",
    "we find that the distribution of the beaming corrected energy release in the gamma - ray band ranges from @xmath62 erg ( grb 041006 ) to @xmath63 erg ( grb 990123 ) . in combination with the corresponding peak energies , @xmath64 , in the gamma - ray band @xcite , in figure  [ ecorepeak ] we plot the correlation between @xmath65 and @xmath64 in the grb host frame , as it was first reported by @xcite .",
    "considering bursts # 9 and # 12 as outliers and excluding them from the fit , we find @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) as well as @xcite . on the other hand , there are differences , in particular concerning the existence of the two outliers .",
    "they can be understood , however , since the fit includes assumptions about the gas density in the grb environment , which enters the calculation of the jet opening angle .",
    "we made use of the values provided by @xcite and these are higher by a factor of 10/3 compared to the values used by ghirlanda et al .",
    "in addition , in several cases the gamma - ray data given in @xcite are notably different from those used by ghirlanda et al .",
    "additionally , we also considered a wind - like circumburst medium for some cases to calculate the jet half - opening angle , while ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) only regard an ism - like circumburst medium .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that we do not exactly reproduce their results ( for a discussion , see also friedman & bloom 2005 ) .",
    "for instance , if we reduce the assumed circumburster gas density for bursts # 9 and # 12 from 10 to 1 @xmath68 , then the corresponding data points do not fall out of the sample anymore . a fit",
    "then provides @xmath69 . while our data base is too small in order to investigate the role of outliers in the ghirlanda relation , we note that also the relation between the isotropic equivalent energy release in the gamma - ray band and the intrinsic peak energy @xcite is not very tight . in a recent study on batse grbs ,",
    "@xcite find that about 25% of all bursts do substantially deviate from this empirical relation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the ghirlanda relation , we have searched for linear correlations between all individual afterglow parameters and between the burst parameters in the gamma - ray band and the corresponding afterglow parameters .",
    "table  [ tabcor ] lists the corresponding correlation coefficients derived from weighted linear fits .",
    "the ghirlanda relation ( here including the two outliers discussed above ) is between @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "relatively tight correlations between @xmath59 and @xmath72 and between @xmath59 and @xmath73 are expected , as @xmath59 derives from @xmath72 and @xmath74 derives from @xmath59 .",
    "note that the correlations for the wind model are much tighter than for the ism model , giving further significance to the statistical conclusion that most circumburst environments are wind - blown (   [ profile ] ) .",
    "next to the ghirlanda relation and the others just discussed , there are more correlations that seem significant according to the absolute correlation coefficient , but visual inspection does not support this conclusion .",
    "this holds also for the potential correlation between @xmath59 and @xmath4 which has been reported for x - ray data @xcite .",
    "still , it is interesting to note that @xmath5 seems more or less correlated with all other parameters , including the redshift .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath59 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are completely uncorrelated with the redshift .",
    "we conclude that no evolutionary effect in the initial explosion parameters is evident over a wide range of redshifts",
    ".    of special interest is the parameter @xmath7 , which indicates the smoothness of the break ( equation  [ mag1 ] ) .",
    "even though we could only determine @xmath7 for a few afterglows , it looks suspicious that each time we had to fix @xmath7 to a relatively high value in order to get an acceptable fit , the prebreak decay slope is @xmath76 . to test",
    "if this could be due to a numerical problem we reconsidered the afterglow light curve of grb 030329 and fitted it only between 0.28 and 1 days , which includes the time around the supposed jet break ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but excludes the cooling break @xcite and the rebrightening episodes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for this time period the data density is high enough in order to deduce a value for @xmath7 even if the break is very sharp .",
    "indeed , in this case we find @xmath77 days , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . adding this to our sample of afterglows with a deduced parameter @xmath7 ( table  [ tabres ] )",
    ", a weak trend between @xmath7 and @xmath4 becomes apparent ( fig .",
    "[ a1n ] ) .",
    "it indicates that a shallow prebreak decline leads to a smooth break or , seen the other way around , a smooth break ( a `` rollover '' ) implies a shallow prebreak decay slope .",
    "as we only have very few values of @xmath7 , we do not regard this as strong statistical evidence for a correlation , since an observational bias can not be excluded .",
    "afterglows with a shallow decay are bright for a longer period of time , which makes them easier to follow .",
    "therefore , the data density around the break time is usually higher compared to most afterglows with a steep decline .",
    "a high data density around the break time is essential to determine a value for @xmath7 , however .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth to check if this trend is confirmed in the _ swift_-era .",
    "unfortunately , most bursts in our sample are at high redshift , so that no supernova data are available .",
    "consequently , no statistically founded conclusions can be drawn on a potential correlation between afterglow parameters and the corresponding supernova parameters ( paper i ) .      in principle , equation ( [ mag1 ] ) represents a first order approximation of an observed afterglow light curve .",
    "we consider any residuals that remain after subtraction of the fit from the observational data as the fine structure in the light curve .",
    "since the detection of fine structure in optical afterglows depends strongly on the sampling density of the light curve and the quality of the data , an observational bias can not be excluded , which makes it difficult to compare the fine structure among the individual afterglows . on the other hand ,",
    "it is well - known that some afterglows show basically little or no evidence for fine structure when sampled very densely with the same telescope ( the best example being grb 020813 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while others show a substantial amount of fine structure ( e.g. , grb 030329 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 4 ) .",
    "in order to investigate the occurrence of fine structure in more detail , we have shifted all residuals to a common evolutionary phase of an afterglow .",
    "we favor the idea that this can be done by normalizing the time @xmath80 that has elapsed sind the grb trigger to the break time @xmath18 of the corresponding afterglow ( table  [ tabres ] ) .",
    "while figure  [ gs1 ] displays the individual light curves and corresponding residuals that remain after subtraction of the fitted curves from the observational data of the 16 afterglows in our sample , figure  [ residuals ] displays all residuals in a single plot as a function of @xmath81 .",
    "we have included here only those data with less or equal 0.05 mag individual photometric error .",
    "the ratio @xmath81 is independent of redshift and allows us to draw some general conclusions about the occurrence of fine structure in afterglow light curves .",
    "first at all , again we find no evolutionary effect in the data .",
    "the width of the magnitude distribution of the fine structure of all 16 afterglows in the prebreak evolutionary era spanning one decade in time ( @xmath82 ) , is identical to the width of the magnitude distribution in the postbreak era spanning one decade in time ( @xmath83 ) , namely @xmath20 0.1 magnitudes .",
    "the handful of data points around @xmath84 that reach beyond @xmath200.2 magnitudes mainly belong to grb 011211 ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is statistically not significant . this picture does not change if we allow for larger individual photometric errors but then the statistical significance of this finding becomes less strong .",
    "we conclude that , on average , a patchy surface structure of afterglow shock fronts @xcite is not present in the photometry at times later than @xmath85 , with the probable exception of grb 011211 .",
    "in addition , we find that the amplitude of the fine structure of all 16 afterglows as a group ( @xmath200.1 mag ) is smaller by a factor of 4 compared to the fine structure ( or fluctuations ) seen in the optical afterglows of grb 021004 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and grb 030329 @xcite , which are plotted in comparison ) , so most of the data is at @xmath86 . ] .",
    "in other words , the latter two optical afterglows are indeed very different from all other afterglows we have investigated , as the deviations persist even after the break .",
    "on the other hand , the residuals of the early afterglows of grb 021004 and grb 030329 are very similar .",
    "we find via @xmath1 minimization that a shift of the grb 021004 light curve in @xmath81 by a factor of about 2.7 superposes the early light curve evolution of both bursts ( the @xmath1 minimum we find is not sharp , shifts between 2.4 and 3.0 are acceptable ) .",

    "a deeper analysis of this result will be pursued in a future publication ( kann et al .",

    "based on a systematic analysis of the optical and nir data of _ all _ grb afterglows with sufficient published data in the pre-_swift _ era we have explored the parameter space of the afterglow light curves and of physical quantities related to them . from the 59 afterglows investigated ( table  [ tabres ] ) we constructed a sample of 16 bursts with the best - defined light curves useful for our purposes .",
    "thereby we excluded the afterglows of grb 021004 and grb 030329 because of their many re - brightening episodes which made it difficult to fit them .    using the sample of the 16 afterglows with the best defined light curves",
    ", we find that in the optical bands , the average afterglow light curve is characterized by a prebreak decay slope @xmath87 and a postbreak decay slope @xmath88 .",
    "the distribution of both parameters is rather broad but possible cutoffs are apparent in the available data set . in particular",
    ", there is no evidence for a universality of @xmath5 as it has been predicted in some afterglow models .",
    "the distribution of the break time in the host frame rises sharply towards smaller values , with the most likely value at @xmath89 days .",
    "we have then used the deduced light curve parameters to extract information about the nature of the grb environment using standard afterglow models @xcite .",
    "we find that in most if not all cases the data are in agreement with a wind model .",
    "a general preference of an ism model is ruled out .",
    "in addition , we find that the distribution of the power - law index @xmath50 of the electron distribution function is rather broad ranging from about 1.5 to 3 , supporting the view of a non - universality of @xmath50 , in agreement with other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , we have searched in our data set for potential correlations between the various light curve parameters and those that characterize the corresponding burst in the gamma - ray band . with the exception of the ghirlanda relation between the beaming corrected energy release in the gamma - ray band and peak energy in the grb host frame ( ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004 ) , no other tight correlation has been found .",
    "an intriguing correlation may exist between the pre - break decay slope @xmath4 and the smoothness parameter of the break @xmath7 , but more data is needed to verify this .    finally we have analyzed in which manner the data indicate to a general fine structure that is superimposed a light curve decay according to the empirical beuermann double power - law .",
    "when normalized to the corresponding break time @xmath18 of a burst we find no evidence in the data that there is more structure in the light curves at times @xmath90 than at times @xmath91 . on the other hand , we find that the afterglows of grb 021004 and grb 030329 are very different from all 16 afterglows in our sample . while the latter vary on average by only 0.1 magnitudes around the fitted light curve , the former vary by 0.4 magnitudes",
    ". moreover , the fine structure of the light curves of grb 021004 and grb 030329 are initially very similar .",
    "it is clear that more afterglows with well - sampled optical light curves are needed in order to get better insight onto the parameter space of the physical processes involved . even in the _ swift _ era",
    "this might not be an easy task since most afterglows are simply very faint some days after the burst .",
