    "physics in spacetimes with extra dimensions yields many theoretical insights and poses new experimental challenges .",
    "though the idea of introducing higher dimensions has been around for more than 80 years ( since the kaluza - klein proposal ) , it has been successfully reinvented since the advent of string theory . in large part",
    "this is due to the general expectation that the existence of additional spatial coordinates might resolve a number of problematic issues such as the smallness of cosmological constant , the hierarchy between energy scales , and the accelerating expansion of the universe , that consideration becomes of great interest and importance in the last few years .",
    "> from this perspective the brane - world scenario offers tantalizing new prospects for addressing puzzling issues rooted in both cosmology and particle physics .",
    "pioneering work by randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite posited two models with non - flat extra dimensions in which the universe is regarded as a three - dimensional brane located at a fixed point of an @xmath3 orbifold in five dimensions .",
    "the zero modes of the gravitational field , which turn out to be massless on the branes , can be trapped on the brane for perturbations around a flat brane geometry . in the context of string theory ,",
    "the context of the model arises from the @xmath4 heterotic string theory related to an eleven - dimensional supergravity theory on orbifold @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the rs brane - world scenario has drawn much attention because it offers new possibilities for addressing both the gauge hierarchy problem and the cosmological constant problem .",
    "its rather different cosmological perspective generated several attempts to recover conventional cosmology from it .",
    "these include radion stabilization mechanisms bdl , cgkt , cgrt , cgs , hbkim , bdel , klmk and related works associated with inflation @xcite and quintessential brane models @xcite .    on the other hand , dvali _ et al .",
    "_ suggested a brane - induced model with a flat large extra dimension in five dimensions @xcite , which shows that the theory on a @xmath6-brane in five dimensional minkowski spacetimes gives rise to the four - dimensional newtonian potential at short distances while the potential at large distances is that of the five - dimensional theory .",
    "therefore , the model was regarded as an interesting attempt at modifying gravity in the infrared ( ir ) region . in the context of ir modification of general relativity ,",
    "another intriguing suggestion is the _ ghost condensation _",
    "mechanism @xcite in which a condensing ghost field forms a sort of fluid with an equation - of - state parameter , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , that fills the universe but has different properties from that of a cosmological constant . the ghost condensate breaks time - translation symmetry ( a kind of lorentz symmetry breaking ) , making the graviton massive in the ir region and giving rise to a stable vacuum state in spite of a wrong - signed kinetic term .",
    "this is somewhat like a gravitational analogue of the higgs mechanism , and the model has been proposed as a candidate that could account for a consistent ir modification of general relativity and for a connection between inflation and the dark energy / matter @xcite .",
    "although incorporating ghosts in a cosmological model with extra dimensions has been suggested before @xcite , a model with condensing ghosts offers a mechanism for producing matter or vacuum energy from exotic objects that has not yet been considered .",
    "motivated by the preceding considerations , in this paper we explore the consequences of combining the brane - world scenario with the ghost condensate model .",
    "we find that ghost condensation is not possible with a static extra dimension .",
    "a dynamic radion field can provide a mechanism for condensation , but is generically unstable .",
    "another way to achieve ghost condensation is by introducing bulk matter .",
    "this can make the radion static , but has the effect of reducing the system to the four - dimensional case studied in ref.@xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] , we present the five - dimensional einstein - hilbert action with the cosmological constant , brane tensions , and an arbitrary function of the scalar kinetic terms , @xmath0 .",
    "the field equation for @xmath0 is investigated . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] , the brane junction conditions are imposed and the five - dimensional equations of motion with a constraint are derived for a static extra dimension . the friedmann and the acceleration equations on the brane are derived by following the bin@xmath9truy - deffayet - langlois ( bdl ) type approach bdl , hbkim , bdel , klmk .",
    "we show that the conservation equations on the brane are satisfied . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] , we show that small perturbations of the brane along the extra dimension can give rise to ghost condensation and the equations at late times can determine the vacuum as minkowski spacetime .",
    "although the model describes the radiation - dominated universe at late times , it is accompanied by an unstable radion field .",
    "we address this issue in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] , where we show that the instability of the radion field can be resolved by introducing bulk matter along the @xmath2-direction .",
    "this bulk matter can make the radion stable , and reduces the system to that of the four - dimensional case , which has an inflationary solution for the scale factor and a late - time cosmic speed - up .",
    "this also offers consistent solutions with the stable radius of extra dimension , describing a de - sitter ( ds ) phase in which the resulting evolution of the ghost condensate behaves like a cosmological constant with @xmath10 at late times . finally , some discussion and comments on our results are given in sec .",

    "( [ eq : stabrels ] ) , @xmath213 these equations are the same as those in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the analysis is similar . a plot of the deceleration parameter , @xmath214 , and the equation - of - state parameter , @xmath215 appear in fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "the only drawback to this model is the rather ad - hoc appearance of @xmath33 .",
    "one might hope that it could arise from the ghost field in some manner .",
    "the only possiblilty would appear to be giving the ghost field a @xmath2-dependence .",
    "however it is clear that this proposal can not succeed . if we assume that @xmath216 , the stabilization condition becomes @xmath217 comparing this with eq .",
    "( [ eq : genrelstable ] ) , we have @xmath218",
    ". however , this inevitably vanishes as @xmath20 goes to infinity since @xmath219 at late times , which finally leads to a minkowski vacuum after condensation , yielding again an unstable radion field .",
    "consequently the bulk field @xmath33 can not originate from the ghost .",
    "however we note that it can arise from the back reaction of the dilaton coupling to the brane @xcite .    to summarize , introducing bulk matter stabilizes the radius of the extra dimension , alters the evolution of the ghost field and the scale factor , and prevents the cosmological constant from vanishing , which renders a ds phase on the brane and finally leads to an accelerating expansion at late times .",
    "higher derivative terms for the ghost , in which @xmath220 , where @xmath221 can be analyzed in a similar manner .",
    "if @xmath59 , we find that the situation can be simply classified by two cases : one for @xmath222even and another for @xmath222odd .",
    "for @xmath222even , the general behavior is quite similar to the preceding case for @xmath223 up to the factor @xmath224 , which results from the fact that there always exists a stable vacuum point at @xmath187 .",
    "however , the odd power cases do not include the stable point at @xmath187 , and so the situation is of no interest in connection with the issue of the ghost condensation .",
    "nevertheless , one might consider two ways of circumventing the situation for @xmath222odd .",
    "one is to regard the ghost condensate vacuum @xmath187 as a metastable state .",
    "provided we can sit long enough at a point of inflection of @xmath225 , these solutions could be viable for cosmological evolution , with the true condensate vacuum occurring the global minimum of @xmath225 .",
    "another way is to place the condensate minimum on the brane , writing latexmath:[${\\mathcal p}(x ) =    in this case , the discontinuity at @xmath187 is identified with the location of the brane at @xmath63 . since we also have a discontinuity at @xmath63 we could construct a new model for @xmath222odd power of ghosts that possesses a stable minimum .",
    "as before , this situation can be addressed by introducing non - vanishing bulk matter , @xmath33 , with no additional modifications of the model .",
    "the bulk matter makes the radion stable and alters the evolution of the ghost condensate , whose equations reduce to @xmath227\\ ] ] or alternatively @xmath228 which have not been previously analyzed .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the integrands of eq .",
    "( [ eq : inaltformx ] ) for each @xmath229 have qualitatively similar behavior .",
    "consequently the evolution of higher derivative ghosts with bulk matter is qualitatively equivalent to the @xmath223 case for both @xmath230 even and odd .",
    "we can obtain some analytic information about the evolution of the condensate in the large @xmath20 limit .",
    "since @xmath113 goes to @xmath231 we can employ the ansatz @xmath232 , where @xmath233 is a positive constant .",
    "this induces a differential equation for @xmath234 which is @xmath235 for large @xmath20 , exp@xmath236 goes to zero , which reduces the differential equation to @xmath237.\\ ] ] to solve this , we note that @xmath238 should be a constant(i.e .",
    "@xmath239 ) at large @xmath20 .",
    "this determines @xmath240 , where we take the plus sign to ensure a decaying solution for @xmath113 .",
    "now we consider the next leading term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdeq2 ] ) . plugging the value of @xmath233 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdeq2 ] ) leads to the solution , @xmath241 where @xmath242 is an integration constant .",
    "( [ eq : fsols ] ) shows that the function @xmath234 becomes a constant as @xmath20 goes to infinity and the solution of @xmath113 is @xmath243 illustrating that the solutions have qualitatively similar behavior .",
    "since we are working in the near - vacuum region , the effects of higher order terms beyond the leading contribution at a given @xmath230 will be negligible at late times .",
    "we have studied the rs brane - world model with an arbitrary function @xmath0 of the kinetic term of a scalar field in the five - dimensional ads spacetimes .",
    "an interesting aspect of our model is that the generic function @xmath0 is uniquely determined in the brane - world with a static extra dimension .",
    "once time - evolution of the radius of the extra dimension is taken into account , the solution gives rise to ghost condensation .",
    "this implies that the excitation of the brane along the extra coordinate results in a ghost condensate and the ghost field approaches the stable vacuum at late times .",
    "another intriguing feature of this model is that the minimum value of the ghost condensate vacuum cancels out the cosmological constant .",
    "this inevitably leads to the minkowskian vacuum on the brane after the ghost condensation at late times . in this background",
    ", a radiation - dominated universe can be generated by the vacuum fluctuations of the ghost condensate . as a result ,",
    "vacuum fluctuations of ghosts can generate radiating matter at late times by the ghost condensation .",
    "however , this scenario inevitably yields an unstable radion .",
    "this instability can be circumvented by introducing a bulk field along the @xmath2-direction , preserving the consistency of the equations of motion and reducing the system to that of the four - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "this sort of bulk matter along the extra dimension can arise from the back reaction of the dilaton field @xcite , which is obviously responsible for the stabilized radion .",
    "since it alters the time - evolution of the scale factor and the ghost field , the model ultimately leads to the inflationary expanding scale factor and the acceleratingly expanding epoch at late times .",
    "in addition , the condensing ghost behaves like a cosmological constant since it approaches to @xmath244 as times goes on .",
    "one of the interesting features in this model is that the spacetimes with an initially negative curvature ( ads ) transfers to the spacetimes with a positive curvature ( ds ) as the condensing ghost approaches to the stable vacuum , which results from the fact that the vacuum of the ghost condensation ( @xmath165 ) forbids the effective cosmological constant ( @xmath245 ) to be negative or vanish .    for @xmath223 an analysis of our model",
    "has already been carried out in ref .",
    "however there are some distinctions between the two models .",
    "the main point of our model was to investigate if / how ghost condensation can appear from a wiggling brane along the extra dimension .",
    "one of the interesting features of our model is that the zero point energy ( @xmath165-term ) of ghost condensation inevitably must appear in order to preserve consistent equations of motion , which are ultimately responsible for the ds expansion at late times .",
    "the situation for larger @xmath230 has not been previously analyzed ; we find that the behaviour of the ghost condensate is qualitatively similar to the @xmath223 case .    as a consequence ,",
    "ghost condensation in the rs brane - world model with the stabilized radius of the extra dimension provides a possible explanation of an accelerating universe at late times .",
    "in addition , the model might offer a possible account of an early universe inflationary cosmology , which would be worthwhile to explore in the future .",
