    "( [ rt2 ] ) , has a single positive root @xmath24 satisfying @xmath18 .    when the schwarzschild mass @xmath8 is negative , the umbilical cmc slice runs from future null infinity , where @xmath25 , directly into the naked singularity at @xmath26 and @xmath13 decreases monotonically along the slice .",
    "it turns out that the 2-parameter family of metrics given by eq .",

    "( [ m ] ) is this conserved quantity in the new variables .",
    "] note that we can add an arbitrary constant to the definition of ` time ' .",
    "this is equivalent to multiplying @xmath43 by a constant and thus generates the rescaling of eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "we have chosen notation for the total energy deliberately .",
    "it will emerge that this @xmath8 coincides with the value of the mass of the schwarzschild solution this given constant negative scalar curvature can be imbedded into .",
    "we can , and will , write down the explicit solutions of eq .  ( [ m ] ) , and in turn the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ cf3 ] ) , in terms of weierstrass elliptic functions .",
    "however , before we do so we would like to study the qualitative nature of the solutions . the repulsive potential increases rapidly with increasing @xmath58 .",
    "this means that the ` particle ' will reach infinity in finite ` time ' , irrespective of the value of @xmath8 .",
    "hence the value of @xmath36 will always blow up at some finite @xmath43 .",
    "the solutions split into three groups , depending on the sign of @xmath8 .",
    "there are the solutions with @xmath63 .",
    "these come in from @xmath64 starting at some finite time , strike the potential barrier at some strictly positive value of @xmath58 , and return to @xmath65 .",
    "when we translate back to @xmath28 , we get a ` u ' shaped solution .",
    "it starts off with @xmath66 at some value of @xmath43 , decreases as @xmath43 decreases until @xmath36 reaches some finite minimum value and increases again to reach infinity at some other smaller value of @xmath43 .",
    "note that we chose @xmath54 , so @xmath43 decreases as @xmath67 increases .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath58 , call it @xmath68 , occurs when @xmath69 remember that @xmath70 , but of course @xmath71 , the schwarzschild radius .",
    "therefore the minimum value of @xmath72 coincides with the minimum value of @xmath73 such that @xmath74 .",
    "therefore eq .",

    "the equation that @xmath24 satisfies , in the umbilical slice , is @xmath76 ( eq .",

    "we have set @xmath77 , so @xmath78 .",
    "this equation becomes @xmath79 . by comparing the two equations we immediately see that @xmath80 is the correct expression for the potential .",
    "therefore the ` u ' shaped solutions are the umbilical slices which run from one future infinity to the other .",
    "we see that as @xmath58 diverges , @xmath13 diverges , and @xmath36 diverges , but @xmath67 runs over a finite interval and @xmath43 , the flat radial coordinate , only covers a similar finite interval .",
    "the solutions with @xmath81 are the positive energy solutions and correspond to the umbilical slices in the negative mass schwarzschild solution .",
    "they do not ` bounce ' off the potential , but continue all the way into @xmath82 , which , of course corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "there are two sets of solutions .",
    "one set comes in from infinity and strike the singularity at @xmath26 while the other starts at @xmath26 and heads out to infinity .",
    "finally , there are the special cases where @xmath83 .",
