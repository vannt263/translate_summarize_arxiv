    "planck _ s determination of @xmath5@xmath6 , which is now limited by cosmic variance , is the most precise measure of this fundamental physical quantity for the foreseeable future ( when derived from the cmb ) .    for a long time",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) , it has been appreciated that a complementary measurement of @xmath5@xmath6  can be deduced from the relative abundances of the light elements that were created during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . aside from protons , the only stable nuclei that were produced in astrophysically accessible abundances are @xmath22h ( a.k.a .",
    "deuterium , d ) , @xmath23he , @xmath13he , and trace amounts of @xmath24li ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "in particular , considerable effort has been devoted to measuring the abundance of deuterium ( d / h ) , the mass fraction of @xmath13he ( @xmath14 ) , and the abundance of @xmath24li . of these",
    ", the primordial abundance of deuterium is generally accepted as the best ` baryometer ' , owing to its sensitivity and monotonic relationship to @xmath5@xmath6 .    the mass fraction of @xmath13he , on the other hand , is relatively insensitive to @xmath5@xmath6 , but depends quite strongly on the expansion rate of the early universe ( typically parameterized in non - standard models of bbn as an effective number of neutrino species , @xmath8 ) . at present",
    ", this measurement is primarily limited by systematic uncertainties in converting the he and h emission lines of metal - poor ii  regions into an estimate of @xmath14  ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "unlike @xmath14 , the @xmath24li / h  ratio depends modestly on both @xmath5@xmath6  and @xmath8 .",
    "however , the observationally inferred value for the `` primordial '' level , derived from metal - poor galactic halo stars @xcite , is discrepant by a factor of @xmath25 compared with the standard model predictions , becoming even more discrepant at the lowest metallicities @xcite .    as pointed out recently by @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , _ precise _ measures of the primordial d / h ratio can provide interesting bounds on @xmath8 , when combined with a measure of @xmath5@xmath6  from the cmb .",
    "the promise of this method was recently demonstrated by @xcite , who obtained the most precise measure of the d / h ratio to date , using a metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath26 ) damped lyman  @xmath1 system ( dla ) , seen in absorption against a bright background quasar .",
    "the prospect of measuring the d / h ratio in gas clouds seen in absorption along the line - of - sight to a high - redshift quasar was first pointed out by @xcite .",
    "this vision was only realized much later , with the advent of 8 - 10 m class telescopes equipped with high resolution echelle spectrographs @xcite . since these first discoveries ,",
    "a handful of additional cases have been identified ( see @xcite for the ` _ _ top - ten _ _ ' list ) , including one system that appears to be chemically pristine @xcite .",
    "one lingering concern with this prime set of measurements is that the dispersion in the reported d / h measures is significantly larger than the quoted errors ( first noted by @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , a simple @xmath27 test reveals that the errors for all d / h measurements would need to be scaled upwards by @xmath28 , if the observed dispersion were due to chance alone .",
    "an alternative possibility , if the quoted random errors are in fact realistic , is that the analyses may suffer from small systematic biases that are now important to recognize and correct for .",
    "this concern has prompted us to identify the rare handful of systems which afford _ precise _ measurements of the primordial abundance of deuterium together with realistic error estimates .",
    "this effort is part of our ongoing survey to study the chemistry of the most metal - poor dlas , described in more detail in @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper , we present the _ precision sample _ of primordial deuterium abundance measurements , consisting of the current best estimates of d / h in qso absorption line systems .",
    "we also report a dla where a new , precise measurement of the primordial deuterium abundance could be obtained .",
    "all of these systems have been reanalyzed in a self - consistent manner , taking into account the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty . in the following section , we provide the details of the observations and data reduction procedures for the newly observed dla , and",
    "discuss the selection criteria we have adopted to define the precision sample . in section  [ sec : profanalysis ] , we describe the analysis of the new system with deuterium absorption , and estimate its d / h ratio . in section  [ sec :",
    "cosmology ] we derive the value of ( d / h)@xmath3  from the precision sample , discuss its cosmological implications , and consider current limitations in using d / h abundance measurements for cosmology .",
    "section  [ sec : newphysics ] deals with the implications of our results for physics beyond the standard model , considering in particular bounds on the effective number of neutrino families and on the lepton asymmetry .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] , we summarize the main findings from this work .",
    "most newly discovered dlas are now identified using the low - resolution spectra provided by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "recent searches for dlas have yielded several thousand systems @xcite . at the modest resolution ( @xmath30 ) and",
    "signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n@xmath31 ) of the sdss spectra , the metal absorption lines of the most metal - poor dlas are unresolved and undetected .",
    "follow - up , high spectral resolution observations are thus required to pin - down their chemical abundances ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite were the first to recognize the very metal - poor dla at redshift @xmath32 towards the @xmath33 quasar sdss j1358@xmath296522 .",
    "on the basis of their intermediate resolution observations ( 60 km s@xmath21 full - width at half maximum ; fwhm ) with the keck echellette spectrograph and imager , these authors concluded that this dla has a metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath34 , and is thus among the most metal - poor known @xcite .",
    "we re - observed this qso with the keck high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ; @xcite ) using the red cross - disperser to perform an accurate chemical abundance analysis @xcite .",
    "the hires data pinned down the metallicity of the dla ( [ fe / h]@xmath350.03 ) and provided the first indication for the presence of a handful of resolved i  absorption lines .",
    "taking advantage of the high efficiency of the hires uv cross - disperser at blue wavelengths , we then performed dedicated hires observations with the goal of obtaining a precise measure of the deuterium abundance .",
    "our observations included a total of @xmath36s on 2012 , may 11 , ( divided equally into nine exposures ) and an additional @xmath37s on 2013 , may 3 and 5 .",
    "an identical instrument setup was employed for both runs ; we used the c1 decker ( @xmath38 , well - matched to the seeing conditions of @xmath39 ) , which delivers a nominal spectral resolution of @xmath40 ( @xmath41 km s@xmath21 fwhm ) for a uniformly illuminated slit .",
    "our setup covers the wavelength range @xmath42 , with small gaps near 4550  and 5550due to the gaps between the hires detector chips .",
    "the exposures were binned on - chip @xmath43 .",
    "the data were reduced following the standard procedures of bias subtraction , flat - fielding , order definition and extraction .",
    "the data were mapped onto a vacuum , heliocentric wavelength scale from observations of a thar lamp which bracketed the science exposures . to test the quality of the data reduction",
    ", we reduced the data using two pipelines : makee which is maintained by t.  barlow , and hiredux which is maintained by j.  x.  prochaska .",
    "we found that the skyline subtraction performed by hiredux was superior to that of makee , and substantially improved the s / n of the spectra at blue wavelengths .",
    "this was very important for the removal of telluric features near the redshifted i  and i  transitions of the dla .",
    "all data analyzed and presented herein for j1358@xmath296522 were reduced with hiredux .",
    "the individual orders were combined with uves_popler , which is maintained by m.  t.  murphy . as a final step , we flux - calibrated the echelle data by comparison to the sdss data .",
    "the combined s / n ratio of the final spectrum per 2.5 km s@xmath21 pixel is @xmath44 near 4000 , @xmath45 at 5000  and @xmath46 near 6000 .",
    "the reduced , flux - calibrated spectrum is presented in figure  [ fig : fluxqso ] , where the red tick marks indicate the wavelengths of the redshifted i  lyman series transitions .        in this section ,",
    "we outline the strict set of rules that we have used to define the precision sample .",
    "our goal is to identify the small handful of systems currently known where the most accurate and precise measures of d / h can potentially be obtained .",
    "the set of restrictions we applied are as follows :    * we require that the i  ly@xmath1  absorption line must exhibit lorentzian damping wings .",
    "this criterion is satisfied for absorption line systems with log @xmath47/@xmath48 .",
    "such absorption lines lie on the damping regime of the curve - of - growth , where @xmath47  can be derived independently of the cloud model ; the damping wings uniquely determine the total i  column density . * due to the power of the i  ly@xmath1  transition in establishing the total i  column density , we require that the wings of this transition are not strongly blended with nearby , unrelated , strong i  absorption systems . if there exist additional strong i  absorption systems nearby , we impose that the edges of their ly@xmath1  absorption troughs should be separated by at least 500 km s@xmath21 , and that all such absorption systems should be modelled simultaneously . * at least two , resolved and apparently unblended , optically thin transitions of i  must be available .",
    "this ensures that the total i  column density can be measured accurately , and independently of the cloud model . *",
    "the data must have been obtained with a high resolution echelle spectrograph , with @xmath49 ( i.e. @xmath50 km s@xmath21 ) , to resolve the broadening of the i  lines , and recorded at s / n @xmath51 per pixel ( @xmath25 km s@xmath21 ) at both ly@xmath1  and the weakest i  absorption line used in the analysis . * several unblended metal lines with a range of oscillator strengths for a given species ( ideally oi  and siii ) must be present if there is only one optically thin i  transition in order to determine the velocity structure of the absorbing cloud , and ensure that the presence of any partly ionized gas ( which may contribute to the i  column density ) is accurately modelled . however , if there exist at least two optically thin i  transitions , metal lines are not strictly required .",
    "of course , we are also limited by data that we , and others , have access to .",
    "data that are not publicly available on archives could not be used in this study . in total , there are four systems in the literature that meet the above criteria .",
    "we now give a brief description of these systems .",
    "keck+hires observations of the qso hs0105@xmath291619 were obtained as follows : 1800s in 1999 ( program i d : u05h , pi : a.  wolfe ) , 85000s in 19992000 by omeara et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and 21500s in 2005 ( program i d : g10h , pi : d.  tytler ) .",
    "the data obtained by @xcite are not available from the keck observatory archive .",
    "thus , we have reanalysed only the last dataset which , in any case , was obtained with a much improved hires detector .",
    "as reported by @xcite , the spectrum shows nine clean i  transitions in the lyman series together with four optically thin i  absorption lines ; the absorption is confined to a single velocity component at @xmath53 . the first ions exhibit slightly asymmetric profiles , arising from ionized gas blueshifted by @xmath54 km s@xmath21 relative to the main component ( see figure  [ fig : hs0105p1619 ] ) .",
    "the i  column density of this ionized component contributes just 0.01 dex to the total column density @xmath55(hi)/@xmath56 .",
    "the data and best - fitting model are shown in figure  [ fig : hs0105p1619 ] .",
    "the quasar q0913@xmath29072 intersects a dla with @xmath55(hi)/@xmath58 at @xmath57 .",
    "q0913@xmath29072 was observed with the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) on the european southern observatory s ( eso ) very large telescope ( vlt ) facility in 2002 ( program i d : 68.b-0115(a ) , pi : p.  molaro ) , and then again in 2007 to obtain uv coverage down to the lyman limit ( program i d : 078.a-0185(a ) , pi : m.  pettini ) , resulting in a total exposure time of 77500s .",
    "the details of this system s chemical composition were reported by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and the analysis of the di lines was presented by @xcite ; with [ o / h]@xmath59 this is currently the most metal - poor dla known with resolved i  lines .",
    "there is a small column density of ionized gas at velocities near that of the dla ; we have carefully modelled its contribution to the overall absorption in the metal lines and the i  lyman series ( see figure  [ fig : q0913p072 ] ) .",
    "since q0913@xmath29072 does not have an sdss spectrum from which we could perform a flux calibration , we obtained a set of vlt+fors2 ( focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph 2 ) exposures from the vlt archive to flux calibrate the uves spectrum .",
    "( program i d : 70.a-0425(c ) , pi : l.  wisotzki ) .",
    "the fors2 data were reduced following standard procedures , using the software routines from the eso fors2 data reduction pipeline .",
    "the uves data and the corresponding model fits are shown in figure  [ fig : q0913p072 ] .",
    "the chemical properties of this dla were discussed by @xcite , while @xcite reported the analysis of the deuterium lines .",
    "this system currently holds the record for the most precise determination of the d / h ratio .",
    "the analysis technique developed in @xcite is the same as that employed here ( see section  [ sec : analysis ] ) , except for two aspects : ( 1 ) in the present work all qso spectra were analysed `` blind , '' i.e. , without knowledge of the value of d / h until the line fitting procedure was concluded ; and ( 2 ) we now allow for an arbitrary continuum fitting with legendre polynomials , rather than the combination of power - law continuum and gaussian emission lines used by @xcite . to maintain consistency with the other dlas investigated here",
    ", we have reanalyzed this system with the new prescription for the continuum definition , and the analysis was performed blind .",
    "we found that the final value of d / h from this new analysis deviated by just 0.005 dex from that reported by @xcite , with an identical estimate for the error .",
    "this small shift is due to our new approach for dealing with the systematic uncertainty in the continuum level .",
    "the data for j1558@xmath610031 consist of a 11300s keck+hires spectrum obtained in 2006 ( program i d : u152hb , pi : j.  x.  prochaska ) , first reported by @xcite . with @xmath55(hi)/@xmath63 , this @xmath62 dla is the highest i  column density system currently known with at least one optically thin iabsorption feature",
    ". there exists another metal - poor dla along this sightline , at @xmath64 , that also exhibits damped ly@xmath1  absorption ( log@xmath47/@xmath65 = 19.726@xmath66 ) .",
    "this second system contains a single absorption component , as evidenced by several siii  absorption lines ( see bottom - right panel of figure  [ fig : j1558m0031 ] ) .",
    "although i  absorption is only seen in the higher redshift dla , we include the i  and metal lines of both dlas in the fitting procedure , since the damping wings of the two dlas overlap slightly .",
    "portions of the hires spectrum , together with the best - fitting model , are reproduced in figure  [ fig : j1558m0031 ] .",

    "+ [ tab : precision ]    including the new d / h case reported herein , there are just five metal - poor absorption line systems in which a _ precise _ measure of the primordial abundance of deuterium can be obtained , based on the criteria outlined in section  [ sec : litsyst ] .",
    "relevant details of these systems are collected in table  [ tab : precision ] .",
    "the four dlas from the literature were all reanalyzed in an identical manner to that described above ( section 3 ) for j1358@xmath296522 .",
    "in particular , we adopted the same blind analysis strategy and marginalized over the important systematic uncertainties . we refer to this sample of five high quality measurements as the _ precision sample_.    in table  [ tab : precision ]",
    ", we provide a measure of the _ total _",
    "i  column density , along with the associated error .",
    "many of our systems contain more than one component in i  and the column density estimates for these multiple components are correlated with one another .",
    "to calculate the error on the total i  column density , we have drawn 10000 realizations of the component column densities from the covariance matrix .",
    "we then calculated the total column density for each realization ; in table  [ tab : precision ] , we provide the mean and @xmath70 error derived from this monte carlo analysis .",
    "we consider the five measures of i / i  in these dlas as five independent determinations of the primordial abundance of deuterium , ( d / h)@xmath3 , for the following reasons : ( 1 ) we are not aware of any physical mechanism that would alter the ionization balance of d compared to h. thus , to our knowledge , i / i@xmath71d / h ; ( 2 ) the degree of astration of d ( i.e. its destruction when gas is turned into stars ) is expected to be negligible at the low metallicities ( [ o / h]@xmath72 ) of the dlas considered here ( e.g. , see figure 2 of romano et al .",
    "2006 ) ; thus ( d / h)@xmath73 = ( d / h)@xmath3 .",
    "( 3 ) the lack of dust in metal - poor dlas makes it extremely unlikely that selective depletion of d onto grains occurs in the cases considered here [ it has been proposed that such a mechanism may be responsible for the local variations in ( d / h)@xmath74see linsky et al .",
    "2006 ] ; ( 4 ) the five dlas sample entirely independent sites in the distant universe .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ tab : precision ] and figure  [ fig : dhsample ] , the five measures of d / h in the precision sample are in very good mutual agreement and the dispersion of the measurements is consistent with the errors estimated with our improved analysis .",
    "a @xmath27 test indeed confirms that the five measurements are consistent within @xmath17 of being drawn from a single value of d / h .",
    "we can therefore combine the five independent determinations of ( d / h)@xmath73 to deduce the weighted mean value of the primordial abundance of deuterium : @xmath75 @xmath76    this value of ( d / h)@xmath3  is not markedly different from other recent estimates @xcite , but its precision is significantly better than achieved in earlier papers that considered a more heterogeneous set of @xmath77 determinations . for completeness , we have recalculated the weighted mean for all the known d / h measurements listed in table  2 of @xcite , after updating the d / h values of the systems we have reanalyzed here .",
    "the resulting weighted mean value of the primordial deuterium abundance is ( d / h)@xmath3@xmath78 .",
    "this compares very well with the value derived from the precision sample ( eqs .",
    "[ eqn : primdh_log ] and [ eqn : primdh ] ) .",
    "perhaps this is not surprising , since the literature systems that did not meet our selection criteria ( see section  [ sec : criteria ] ) have larger uncertainties , and thus their contribution to the weighted mean value of d / h is relatively low .      using the most up - to - date calculations of the network of nuclear reactions involved in bbn",
