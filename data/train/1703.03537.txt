    "finding the ground state of strongly correlated electron systems is one of most challenging problems in condensed matter physics . since exact solutions",
    "only exist in few systems , deeper understanding of ground state properties strongly relies on efficient and accurate numerical algorithms .",
    "for example , one can employ exact diagonalization ( ed ) to find the wave function accurately , but it is only applicable for very small size systems .",
    "the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite is very efficient and accurate for one dimensional systems , but it becomes inefficient for two and higher dimensional systems . the quantum monte carlo methods@xcite suffer from the sign problem in general fermionic and geometrically frustrated systems .    in the past years , the tensor network algorithms have been widely developed@xcite , which are shown to be promising numerical tools .",
    "one of the simplest tensor network state is the matrix product state ( mps ) , which is the variational wave function of the dmrg method@xcite .",
    "a natural generalization of the mps to two dimensions is the projected entangled pair state ( peps)@xcite , which satisfies the area law of entanglement entropy@xcite . besides peps",
    ", various types of tensor network states have been introduced , such as multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera)@xcite , tree tensor network states@xcite and projected entangled simplex states@xcite .",
    "these tensor network wave functions are usually expressed in a real space basis which may become inefficient to capture the large amount of entanglement in itinerant fermionic systems .",
    "for example , the free fermion model , which can be exactly represented as a product state in momentum space , is extremely difficult to accurately treat by infinite fermionic peps algorithm@xcite .",
    "the variational monte carlo ( vmc)@xcite method can be applied to study relatively large system sizes , and there is no sign problem in studies of fermionic and frustrated systems .",
    "however , the result is subject to be biased depending on the form of variational wave functions . in the region where various competing phases have very closed energy",
    ", it is very challenging to determine the correct ground state .",
    "sorella has developed stochastic reconfiguration ( sr)@xcite method to stably optimize large number of parameters , which makes it possible to extend the variational wave function to substantially alleviate the bias . with the combination of pair - product wavefunctions and the correlation factors such as gutzwiller  @xcite , and jastrow  @xcite factors , as well as the quantum number projections , thousands and ten thousands of the variational parameters",
    "have been optimized , which has enabled accurate estimates of the competing ground states in terms of the comparisons with available exact results  @xcite .",
    "the applications have achieved fruitful and reproducible comparisons with the experimental results , for instance for the iron - based superconductors , if the method is applied to the _ ab initio _ effective hamiltonians@xcite .",
    "however , how to further systematically remove the bias in the variational wave functions and reach better accuracy is still left as a challenge .",
    "the monte carlo sampling techniques have been proposed as a prescription to reduce the computational cost of tensor network contraction in the mps@xcite , peps@xcite and mera@xcite .",
    "another advantage of employing the monte carlo sampling into tensor network methods is that it is possible to choose various types of suitable reference basis beyond the real space basis . in the vmc study of correlator product states@xcite",
    ", a pfaffian pairing wave function has been used@xcite . in the study of one dimensional fermionic system , the free fermion slater determinant has been used as the reference wave function of the mps@xcite , which achieves higher accuracy than the conventional mps method with the same bond dimension . ref .",
    "has generalized this idea to two dimensional systems , which employs the peps with various kinds of reference wave functions , such as jastrow - type , free fermion , @xmath0-wave bcs and spin density wave states , in order to choose a suitable reference wave function that captures the key features of the systems .    in this paper",
    ", we employ a combination of tensor network and reference wave function which consists of a pfaffian pairing wave function and real space correlation factors . in order to provide more flexible representation , we optimize all the variational parameters both in the part of the vmc and the tensor network simultaneously . moreover , we can apply quantum number projections , such as those to restore the spin , momentum and lattice symmetries to further improve the accuracy . as a result , highly accurate ground state wave functions are obtained within a computationally tractable size of tensor bond dimension beyond the accuracy of each method if applied separately .",
    "moreover , the accuracy can be continuously improved with the increase of the tensor bond dimension , thus providing a systematic way of removing the bias in the vmc .",
    "the combination with the vmc is particularly powerful if the tensor network method suffers from the entanglement entropy remaining beyond the area law as in the case of the itinerant fermion systems .    in the latter part of this paper ,",
    "we show a fruitful application to a strongly correlated system : hubbard model on the square lattice .",
    "although the relevance of the hubbard model for the mechanism of the high @xmath1 superconductivity is an open issue , the ground states of the hole - doped two - dimensional hubbard model has been extensively studied and debated for decades , because it is a simplest model of the cuprate superconductors and it captures several important experimental aspects .",
    "however , it was also suggested that strong competitions exist among different states including @xmath0-wave superconductivity and various charge inhomogeneous states such as stripe order and phase separation .",
    "accurate determination of the phase diagram in the plane of the carrier density and the electron correlation strength is still an open question .",
    "the present method opens a possibility of studying the model at the highest accuracy among that ever studied .",
    "we show the numerical results of the @xmath0-wave superconducting correlations and various spin and charge correlations that indeed reveal the severe competition of the these two types of orders and clarifies how they are compromised in the best estimates of the ground states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we introduce our variational wave function , and describe how to optimize large number of parameters in variational monte carlo methods . in sec . [ sec : benchmark ] , we present our benchmark results for the hubbard model in one and two dimensions . in sec.[dopedhubbard ] , we show results obtained by applying the present method to the hole doped hubbard model to understand the interplay between the charge / stripe order and the @xmath0-wave superconductivity . finally , we summarize the methods and results with the future scope in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "although the method presented here is applicable to general fermionic systems on lattices , to make a presentation clearly understandable , we keep in mind the hubbard model with the hopping amplitude @xmath2 between the nearest neighbor sites @xmath3 and the onsite coulomb repulsion @xmath4 defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the creation and annihilation operators of electron with spin @xmath8 at the @xmath9-th and @xmath10-th site , respectively , and @xmath11 is the number operator . here , we take the energy unit @xmath12 .",
    "we mainly consider the model on the @xmath13 square lattice .",
    "the purpose of our work is to provide a flexible variational wave function which can be applied to efficiently capture the key features of the systems .",
    "we apply the wave function employed in the mvmc@xcite as the reference wave function of tensor network states , which is expressed as ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the product of real - space correlation factors @xmath16 in which @xmath17 is the gutzwiller factor@xcite that punishes ( enhances ) the double occupation of electrons on the same site defined as    @xmath18    to take into account the local correlation effects , @xmath19 is the jastrow factor@xcite which accounts for long - ranged density correlations through two - body operators defined as    @xmath20,\\ ] ]    and @xmath21 is the doublon - holon correlation factor@xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 are variational parameters , and @xmath24 when a doublon ( holon ) exists at the site @xmath9 and @xmath25 holons ( doublons ) surround at the @xmath26-th nearest neighbor sites and otherwise , @xmath27 . the range of @xmath26 is taken short , normally up to the second nearest neighbors .    the two - body part @xmath28 is expressed in the real space representation    @xmath29    where @xmath30 denotes the variational parameters , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the number of sites and electrons , respectively .",
    "although the spins @xmath8 and @xmath33 are taken to be opposite in this paper to impose the constraint of the singlet pair , it can be easily generalized to arbitrary spins for better accuracy .",
    "the number of variational parameters are at most @xmath31 , @xmath34 , and @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . to save the computational cost ,",
    "these numbers are sometimes reduced by imposing the sublattice translational invariance . in the case of the sublattice size @xmath37 ,",
    "the numbers are reduced to @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath36 , while @xmath40 is taken site independent in the following study .",
    "the two - body part @xmath28 may contain symmetry broken phases for better accuracy . on top of it , the space group , spin and momentum quantum number projection operators @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be employed to recover the space group , spin su(2 ) symmetry and lattice translational symmetry of the wave function to further improve the accuracy , because these symmetries are preserved for finite - size systems in most of the hamiltonians we study . in this paper , we focus on the case of the singlet @xmath44 , and the total momentum zero @xmath45 because they are satisfied in most of the ground state of models .",
    "we impose the space group symmetry later .",
    "we also note that by imposing these projections , one can also study the lowest excited state of the specified quantum number .    combining with the tensor network algorithm , the variational wave function we are going to optimize is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the tensor network . since the tensor network may break the lattice translational and rotational symmetry explicitly , the momentum projection @xmath48 and space - group symmetry projection ( for instance , the @xmath49 to restore the @xmath50 rotational symmetry in the case of the square lattice ) improve the wave function by recovering the symmetries .",
    "we apply the same quantum number projections to the pfaffian pair state , because this preconditioning further improve the state .",
    "since the spin symmetry is preserved in the tensor network procedure , it is operated only once .",
    "the remaining task is to choose the appropriate tensor network @xmath47 in eq .",

    "the tr is to trace out all the matrix indices .    in two dimensional systems , various types of tensor network states",
    "may be employed . among them",
    "we select and employ to meet several requirements .",
    "the first requirement is that the network structure should keep the lattice symmetry as much as possible .",
    "therefore , the mps will not be considered .",
    "the second requirement is that the tensor network exactly reproduces the ground state in the limit of infinite bond dimensions with nonzero reference basis , so that the accuracy is improved systematically .",
    "therefore , the string bond state@xcite is ruled out , because it does not guarantee the covering of the whole hilbert space even when the infinite bond dimensions are taken .",
    "the third is that we prefer a tensor network in which the contraction can be done without truncation , so that the variational principle will not be broken during the optimization .",
    "therefore , the peps is not employed , since the computational cost grows exponentially if the truncation is excluded .    in order to satisfy the above requirements , we build up the tensor network based on the idea of tree tensor network ( ttn ) as described in appendix [ apdx : ttn ]",
    "the ttn is a two dimensional tensor network which can be contracted exactly in polynomial time .",
    "if we employ the monte carlo sampling on the real space configuration , the physical indices of the leaf tensors are fixed , so every leaf tensor becomes a vector .",
    "therefore , we can start from the contraction of the vector at the leaf tensor and then continue the contraction of rank 3 tensors at the higher hierarchical levels , of which the computational cost scales as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the dimension of the virtual indices .    in the ttn for the @xmath13 lattice ,",
    "the number of bonds of tensors connecting any 2 sites is at most @xmath58 , which has a potentiality to capture the long range entanglement efficiently .",
    "however , the number of bonds of tensors connecting 2 neighboring sites can be as large as @xmath58 , if the neighboring sites belong to a different large block , which poses a limitation .",
    "for instance some of nearby sites belonging to different blocks are sparsely connected via internal - node tensors at a high hierarchical level .",
    "we modify the standard network structure of the ttn to improve the efficiency while keeping the computational cost in the same order .",
    "the aim is to keep the neighboring sites as neighbors also in the tensor network . for this purpose ,",
    "we propose a fat tree tensor network ( fttn ) , which contains redundant physical indices in the leaf node tensors .",
    "consider an @xmath13 square lattice system in which the local hilbert space dimension of each site is @xmath0 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fttn ] for @xmath59 lattice , the fttn is composed of a set of tensors @xmath60 connected as a tree structure , where @xmath61 is the leaf tensor ( meaning the end tensor of the tree structure ) containing @xmath62 physical indices and @xmath63 virtual index , and @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 are internal - node tensors which only contain virtual indices .",
    "every @xmath68 neighboring leaf tensors share 2 common physical indices . in the ttn ,",
    "the number of leaf tensors connecting 2 neighboring sites is always 1 , while it is 2 in the fttn . in the monte carlo sampling ,",
    "the physical degrees of freedom are fixed in every sample , so the tensor network contraction in the fttn will have the same computational complexity as in the ttn .",
    "one can also increase the number of sites in every leaf tensor to make further improvement .",
    "it should be pointed out that regardless of the ttn or fttn , the lattice translational symmetry and rotational symmetry are broken .",
    "( nevertheless , that breaking is weaker than the mps ) . to restore the symmetry , we operate the quantum number projection by the summation over the spatially translated and rotated tensor networks .     lattice .",

    "the backflow correlations can be implemented in the pair - product wave function@xcite , and in this case the additional computational cost of calculating kinetic energy arises because the pairing amplitude with backflow correlations is dependent on a real space configuration of electrons , which scales as @xmath69 . in the simplest consideration of the nearest neighbor sites backflow correlations in two dimensions , the prefactor @xmath70 is about @xmath71 . as a result ,",
    "the numerical cost of employment of backflow correlations is demanding when calculation system size as large as @xmath72 .",

    "one can minimize the energy by choosing appropriate @xmath75 . in principle , the accuracy can be systematically improved by increasing @xmath76 , but the computational cost grows exponentially .",
