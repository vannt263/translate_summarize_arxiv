    "a natural method , which is already over one hundred years old , is to truncate @xmath0 by taking an orthonormal basis @xmath8 of @xmath1 contained in the ( operator or form ) domain of @xmath0 and compute the eigenvalues of the @xmath9 matrix @xmath10 for large @xmath11 , expecting that some of these eigenvalues would be close to @xmath7 .",
