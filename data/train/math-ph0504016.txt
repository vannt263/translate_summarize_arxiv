    "the hydrogen atom in a spherical geometry @xmath6 was firstly studied by schrdinger @xcite in 1940 and analyzed by infeld @xcite and stevenson @xcite at the next year ; some five years later infeld and schild @xcite obtained the spectrum of this system in an ",
    "open universe of constant negative curvature \" ( hyperbolic space @xmath7 ) .",
    "later on , higgs @xcite and leemon @xcite analyzed the characteristics of the two fundamental central potentials , kepler problem and harmonic oscillator , on the @xmath8-dimensional sphere and kalnins _ et al _ , in a study of the dynamical @xmath9 symmetry of the hydrogen atom @xcite , considered the separation of variables of the schrdinger equation with a coulomb potentialn on the sphere @xmath6 using a classifications of coordinate systems separating the laplace equation in the riemannian spaces of constant curvature previously obtained by olevskii @xcite .",
    "since then , a certain number of authors have studied this question from both the classical ( kepler problem ) and the quantum ( hydrogen atom ) points of view @xcite@xcite .",
    "the kepler problem and the harmonic oscillator are the two most important superseparable systems and , because of this , their spherical and hyperbolic versions have been occasionally obtained , in some of the quoted references , as particular cases in the study of superintegrable systems on non - euclidean configuration spaces .",
    "the euclidean superintegrable systems in the plane were studied by fris _",
    "et al _ @xcite and in the three - dimensional space by evans @xcite ; later on different authors have considered this question @xcite@xcite from different points of view . in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied the existence of the spherical and hyperbolic versions of these superintegrable systems taking the space curvature as a parameter ; next the properties of the isotropic and nonisotropic harmonic oscillator and of those superintegrable systems related with the harmonic oscillator were analyzed @xcite .",
    "now , our objective is the study of the kepler problem on the sphere @xmath1 and the hyperbolic plane @xmath2 , both coming naturally from reduction from the ` true ' kepler problem in a three - dimensional curved space @xmath6 or @xmath7 .    in differential geometric terms ,",
    "the euclidean plane @xmath10 is in fact a very particular ` limiting case ' of the constant curvature spaces ; accordingly , in dynamical terms , certain classical and well known potentials ( kepler problem , harmonic oscillator , and systems related with them ) can also be considered as very particular ` limiting cases ' of more general ` curved ' systems .",
    "if the curvature @xmath0 is introduced as a parameter then the question is the analysis of certain potentials in the space with constant curvature @xmath0 ( we may term these as @xmath0-dependent potentials ) with appropriate flat limit . as many different @xmath0-dependent functions may have the same limit when @xmath11 we must require that certain fundamental properties of the euclidean system continue to hold for the ` curved ' system . by fundamental properties we mean those related with separability ( superseparability ) and integrability ( superintegrability ) .",
    "the important point is that the spherical and hyperbolic kepler potential , to be studied in this article , can be characterized as a very specific @xmath0-deformation of the well known euclidean system , and conversely , the euclidean kepler potential arises as the particular @xmath5 case of the @xmath0-dependent ` curved ' system .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to study and solve the kepler problem in the space of constant curvature @xmath0 .",
    "as we will see , one of the advantages of this @xmath0-dependent formalism is that the study runs parallel to that of the euclidean case .",
    "so the structure of this article is very similar to that of the corresponding chapter ( or sections ) devoted to central potentials and kepler problem in some classical books of theoretical mechanics @xcite .",
    "in fact this is the idea of using the deformation as an approach : the curvature @xmath0 will modify many things but will preserve the fundamental structure ; this is so because the deep properties ensuring the possibility of exact solution for the euclidean kepler problem are preserved when a constant curvature is ascribed to the space .",
    "of course , there are significant differences ; one of them will be the geometric interpretation of the solutions that , although rather simple in the euclidean plane , will pose some interesting geometric questions in spaces of constant curvature .    in more detail ,",
    "the plan of this article is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we analyze the free geodesic motion on the spaces @xmath1 , @xmath10 , and @xmath2 , as well as the existence of @xmath0-dependent noether symmetries . in sec .",
    "iii we study some general questions concerning the central potentials on spaces of constant curvature . sec .",
    "iv , that can be considered as the central part of the article , is devoted to the study the @xmath0-dependent kepler problem on the spaces @xmath12 .",
    "we have divided this section in three subsections : in the first part we consider the equivalent one  dimensional problem and we draw a rough classification of the orbits without requiring explicit solutions ; in the second part we solve explicitly the problem and we obtain the expressions of the orbits ; we arrive to the results by using two different methods : firstly by direct integration and secondly by obtaining the @xmath0-dependent version of the binet s equation .",
    "the third subsection is devoted to the analysis and classification of the @xmath0-dependent orbits ; first on the sphere @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) , and then in the hyperbolic plane @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this third subsection poses the difficult problem of interpreting the @xmath0-dependent equations as conics in curved spaces ; of course all the obtained results reduce to well known euclidean trajectories when we consider the particular value @xmath5 .",
    "v , that has a geometric character , is devoted to the study of ( non - euclidean ) conics on the sphere @xmath1 and on the hyperbolic plane @xmath2 , which leads to the identification of the orbits of the kepler problem with conics for any value of the curvature . finally , in sec .",
    "vi we discuss the results and make some final comments .",
    "in the following we will make use of the same notation and techniques introduced for the oscillator in the above mentioned previous articles .",
    "that is , from now on all the mathematical expressions will depend of the curvature @xmath0 as a parameter , in such a way that when assuming @xmath3 , @xmath5 , or @xmath4 , we will obtain the corresponding property particularized on the sphere , on the euclidean plane , or on the hyperbolic plane . in order to present these expressions in a form which holds simultaneously for any value of @xmath0",
    ", we will use the following  tagged \" trigonometric functions @xmath13 and the @xmath0-dependent tangent function @xmath14 defined in the natural way , @xmath15 .",
    "the fundamental properties of these curvature - dependent trigonometric functions are @xmath16 and @xmath17    it is well known that the appropriate coordinates for the study of central potentials are polar @xmath18 coordinates ( see appendix ) ; according to the intrinsic viewpoint , the coordinate @xmath19 in any space of constant curvature @xmath0 is the actual distance measured along the geodesics emanating from an arbitrarily chosen origin point @xmath20 , while @xmath21 has the same meaning as in @xmath22 , the angle between this geodesic and a reference geodesic through @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the range of @xmath19 depends on @xmath0 ; specifically @xmath23 $ ] for @xmath3 and @xmath24 $ ] for @xmath25 .",
    "the range of @xmath21 is the interval @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "so we start with the following @xmath0-dependent expression @xmath27 that represents the differential line element on the spaces @xmath12 with constant curvature @xmath0 .",
    "this metric reduces to @xmath28 in the three particular cases of the unit sphere @xmath29 , euclidean plane @xmath5 , and ` unit ' lobachewski plane @xmath30 .",
    "the three @xmath0-dependent vector fields @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , with coordinate expressions given by @xmath34 are generators of three different one - parameter groups of diffeomorphisms preserving the metric @xmath35 ( isometries of the riemannian manifold ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , the commutators of these vector fields are given by @xmath36 =   -\\,{\\k}\\,y_j \\,,{\\quad }    [ y_1(\\k)\\,,y_j ] =   -\\,y_2(\\k )        \\,,{\\quad }    [ y_2(\\k)\\,,y_j ] =      y_1(\\k )     \\,,\\ ] ] so that they close the lie algebra of the group of isometries of the spherical ( euclidean , hyperbolic ) space .",
    "notice that only when @xmath5 ( euclidean plane ) @xmath37 and @xmath38 will commute .",
    "moreover , the lagrangian for the geodesic ( free ) motion is given by the kinetic term arising from the riemannian metric ; that is @xmath39 and is invariant under the actions of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .    a general standard lagrangian ( @xmath0-dependent kinetic term minus a potential ) has the following form @xmath43 in such a way that for @xmath5 we recover a standard euclidean system @xmath44 in some particular cases this lagrangian system possesses the vector fields @xmath31 , @xmath32 , or @xmath33 , as exact noether symmetries .",
    "if we denote by @xmath45 , @xmath46 , the natural lift to the tangent bundle ( phase space ) of the vector field @xmath47 and by @xmath48 the cartan semibasic one - form @xcite @xmath49 then the cases with exact noether symmetries are the following :    1 .",
    "if the potential @xmath50 is of the form @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , then @xmath53 is a constant of motion .",
    "if the potential @xmath50 is of the form @xmath54 , @xmath55 , then @xmath56 is a constant of motion .",
    "if the potential @xmath50 depends only on the coordinate @xmath19 ( central potential ) , then @xmath57 is a constant of motion .",
    "we remark that the dependence on the curvature @xmath0 is only explicit in the radial dependence of these functions ; the angular dependence , contained in @xmath58 or @xmath59 , is @xmath0independent . as an example , the vector field @xmath33 is @xmath0-independent but the integral of motion @xmath60 is @xmath0-dependent .",
    "these quantities @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , are the @xmath0-dependent versions of the two components of the linear momentum and the angular momentum .",
    "making use of the three @xmath0-dependent functions , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the kinetic energy @xmath64 can be rewritten as follows @xmath65 so that the total energy becomes @xmath66 showing that , on spaces of ( constant ) non - zero curvature , the angular momentum has a contribution to the total energy of the system , proportional to the curvature @xmath0 .",
    "a @xmath0-dependent potential @xmath50 whose expression in ` polar ' coordinates @xmath67 has the structure @xmath68 is hamilton - jacobi separable @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , integrable and has the following two quadratic integrals of motion @xmath69 then , in this separable case , the total energy splits as a sum of two independent constants of motion @xmath70 of course , if @xmath71 then @xmath72 is a central potential and the function @xmath73 just reduces to @xmath74 .",

    "the @xmath21equation just gives the conservation law of the @xmath0-dependent angular momentum ( or the law of areas ) ; concerning the radial equation it can be rewritten as follows @xmath83 \\,,\\ ] ] so that , after multiplying by @xmath84 , it leads to @xmath85 = 0 \\,,\\ ] ] that represents the conservation law of the energy @xmath86 solving for @xmath87 , we obtain @xmath88 } \\,,\\ ] ] that can be solved for @xmath89 and integrated @xmath90 } } \\,,\\ ] ] so that in the particular @xmath5 case we recover the integral of the euclidean case appearing in the books of theoretical mechanics @xmath91 } } .\\ ] ]    coming back to the general @xmath92 case , if we consider a change of variable from @xmath19 to a new variable @xmath93 , by using ( [ ktrig ] ) we get @xmath94 and by considering the potential @xmath95 as a function of the new radial variable , @xmath96 , the above integral for @xmath97 becomes @xmath98 } } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath99 denotes a constant of motion which which plays an important role : @xmath100 ( notice the true energy for curvature @xmath0 is @xmath101 and not @xmath99 ; however @xmath99 can be seen as a kind of @xmath0-deformation of the euclidean energy because @xmath102 for @xmath5 ) .",
    "this integral gives the value of @xmath97 as a function of @xmath103 and consequently also of @xmath19 ; it can be inverted , at least formally , and we can obtain @xmath103 ( or @xmath19 ) as a function of @xmath97 and the two constants @xmath99 and @xmath63 .",
    "the expression of @xmath21 as a function of @xmath97 is just given by @xmath104 we close this section by calling the attention to the factor @xmath105 in the above integral for @xmath97 that clearly resembles to the factor appearing in the elliptic integrals of the third kind .",
    "the following spherical ( hyperbolic ) lagrangian with curvature @xmath0 , @xmath106 represents the @xmath0-dependent version of the euclidean kepler problem ; the potential @xmath107 reduces to @xmath108 in the three particular cases of the unit sphere ( @xmath29 ) , euclidean plane ( @xmath5 ) , and ` unit ' lobachewski plane ( @xmath30 ) ; the euclidean function @xmath109 appears in this formalism as making separation between two different behaviours ( see fig .",
    "the global sign has been chosen so that @xmath110 corresponds to an attractive potential .",
    "this potential is actually worthy of the name ` kepler in curvature @xmath0 ' due to two reasons .",
    "first , this potential is the spherically symmetric potential satisfying gauss law in a _ three - dimensional space of constant curvature @xmath0 _ , where the area of a sphere of radius @xmath19 is @xmath111 , whence the flux of the corresponding radial force field across a sphere of radius @xmath19 , which clearly equals @xmath112 should be a constant independent of @xmath19 ; this condition leads directly to the potential @xmath107 ( as in the euclidean case , the potential @xmath113 does not satisfy the gauss law in two dimensions ) .",
    "the second reason is based on superintegrability : what singularizes @xmath107 among other central potentials with the correct @xmath114 euclidean limit is the property of being a superintegrable system for all the values of the curvature @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath107 is endowed with the following two additional integrals of motion @xmath115 that represent the two - dimensional curvature versions of the runge - lenz constant of motion , whose existence is a consequence of the additional separability of @xmath116 in two different systems of @xmath0-dependent parabolic coordinates ( this superseparability is not studied in this article ) .",
    "of course only three of the four integrals are functionally independent ; so we have several possibilities for the choice of a fundamental set of @xmath0-dependent integrals of motion as , for example , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , or @xmath119 .",
    "let us start for an arbitrary central potential @xmath120 .",
    "we have previously obtained @xmath121 so , if we introduce the ` effective one - dimensional equivalent @xmath0-dependent potential @xmath122 ' defined as @xmath123 where the term @xmath124 plays clearly the role of the ` centrifugal barrier potential ' , then the above property reduces to conservation of the energy for the fictitious @xmath0-dependent one  dimensional problem arising from the potential @xmath125 @xmath126 so that we can use , also in this @xmath0-dependent case , the method of the classification of the orbits by analyzing the behaviour of @xmath125 .",
    "next we will study the main characteristics of the orbits for the kepler potential in curvature @xmath0 where @xmath125 is given by @xmath127 so it reduces to @xmath128 in the three particular one  dimensional problems associated to the unit sphere ( @xmath29 ) , euclidean plane ( @xmath5 ) , and ` unit ' lobachewski plane ( @xmath30 ) .",

    "let us close this direct integration approach with three observations .",
    "first , it turns out that in any of the three manifolds @xmath185 , and for any value of @xmath0 , this curve is a _",
    "conic with a focus at the origin _",
    ", where ` conic ' has to be taken in a metric sense , relative to the intrinsic metric in each space .",
    "this follows from the geometrical study to be presented in section 5 .",
    "second , notice that the quantity @xmath191 is related to the ` partial energy ' @xmath99 exactly as the euclidean eccentricity of the conic is related to the total energy , yet only in the euclidean case ( @xmath5 ) this function @xmath99 coincides with @xmath101 . in the general case ( @xmath92 )",

    "thus the orbit is @xmath213 which depends on two geometric parameters , the constants @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",

    "this discussion alone suffices to establish two landmark values for the energies ( at a fixed value of @xmath63 ) :    * @xmath252 , with @xmath253 , corresponding to the circular orbits with @xmath254 , * @xmath255 , with @xmath256 for orbits where the particle barely reaches spatial infinity with velocity 0 .    to go further in any analysis about the exact nature of the orbits",
    "is easier starting from some geometric knowledge of the properties of conics , to be sketched in the next section .",
    "however , at this point we can provide a first classification into closed and open orbits , and we may discuss its main characteristics .    when the energy is in the interval @xmath257 , the motion is bounded and periodic , while for @xmath101 in the interval @xmath258 $ ] , the motion is not periodic and the orbit goes to the infinity ; notice that @xmath259 is contained _ within _ this second interval , and thus is _ not _ the separating value between bounded and unbounded orbits .",
    "the angular momentum provides a second constant of motion , which may have values in the two subintervals @xmath260 $ ] or @xmath261 $ ] ; it is pertinent to discuss these two possibilities successively .",

    "2 .   if @xmath265 is greater than @xmath266 but in the interval @xmath267 then the orbit will be a closed curve not reaching the spatial infinity . as we will check in sec .  5",

    "we can summarize these three points as follows : the different types of trajectories in @xmath277 , @xmath4 as a function of the parameter @xmath265 are the following @xmath278 alternatively , the landmark values can also be given for the classification as a function of the total energy @xmath101 : @xmath279 thus the behaviour of the hyperbolic dynamics shows some important differences with respect to the euclidean case .",
    "we postpone until the next section the establishment of the particular value of @xmath191 , or @xmath101 , separating the open conics into parabolic and hyperbolic regimes , and we simply state that @xmath280 , corresponding to @xmath259 , gives an orbit which is a parabola in @xmath2 .",

    "in this section we give a geometric description of conics in the three @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath4 , constant curvature spaces @xmath234 , @xmath22 , @xmath277 , emphasizing those aspects relevant in relation with kepler motion in these spaces .",
    "to stay within a reasonable extension limits we restrict to a mainly ` statement of facts ' presentation , which should either confirm the conjectures advanced in the dynamical part , or serve as a geometric foundation for them .",
    "the important thing is the perfect matching between the dynamical approach in sec .  4 and the results here .",
    "as customary in this context , _ lines _ will mean the _ geodesics _ of the constant curvature space .",
    "the metric intrinsic _ geometric _ definition of conics , that can be applied to any 2-d space of constant curvature @xmath0 involves _ focal elements _ ,",
    "i.e. , either oriented points or cooriented lines . in any such space , and by definition :    an _ ellipse / hyperbola _ will be the set of points with a constant sum / difference @xmath282 of distances @xmath283 , to two fixed points @xmath284 , called _ foci _ and separated a distance @xmath285 .",
    "a _ parabola _ will be the set of points with a constant sum / difference @xmath286 of distances @xmath287 , to a fixed point @xmath288 , called _ focus _ , and to a fixed cooriented line @xmath289 , called _ focal line _ ; the _ oriented _ distance @xmath290 between @xmath288 and @xmath289 plays here the role of focal separation .",
    "an _ ultraellipse / ultrahyperbola _ will be the set of points with a constant sum / difference @xmath282 of oriented distances @xmath291 , to two fixed intersecting lines @xmath292 , separated by an angle @xmath293 and called _",
    "focal lines_.    in the generic case of constant curvature @xmath294 these three pairs of curves , each pair sharing the same focal elements , are the _ generic _ conics ; euclidean plane is _ not generic _ among the family of constant curvature spaces , thus some euclidean properties of conics are very special and do not provide a good starting viewpoint to discuss the @xmath294 properties .",
    "further to generic conics , _ particular distinguished conics _",
    "appear for instance when the focal separation vanishes ( @xmath295 ) and _ limiting conics _ when some focal elements go to infinity ( if possible at all ) ; both particular and limiting conics can be obtained as suitable limits from the generic ones .",
    "we first list some particular conics .",
    "when the focal separation vanishes @xmath296 , the ellipse is a _ circle _ and the hyperbola is a pair of intersecting _ lines_. no useful intuition about parabolas can be drawn from the non - generic euclidean case ; a parabola with vanishing focal separation @xmath297 is only a particular instance of parabola , to be named here _ equiparabola _ , but when @xmath294 there are other parabolas , with any positive or negative @xmath298 , which are not equiparabolas .",
    "the main point is that general parabolas are _ not _ to be considered here as limiting conics , as usually done in @xmath22 .",
    "an ultraellipse with focal angle @xmath299 is a _ ultracircle _ ( a equidistant curve , the set of points equidistant from a fixed line ) , while an ultrahyperbola with @xmath299 is a pair of _",
    "lines_.    the three _ generic types _ of conics , as well as these _ particular _ conics with zero focal separation do exist in any space of constant curvature @xmath0 .",
    "further to that , when the curvature is _ negative _ , there are new types of _ limiting conics _ , where either the foci or the focal lines may go to infinity .",
    "now let us describe conics in the three essentially different spaces @xmath234 , @xmath22 , @xmath277 , .    in the sphere @xmath234 , with @xmath3 the situation is rather simple .",
    "first , as there are neither points nor lines at the infinity , there are no limiting cases in the sense they will appear in @xmath277 .",
    "second , as there is a 1 - 1 correspondence ( the usual polarity ) between oriented points and cooriented lines ( north pole versus equator ) , with a constant distance @xmath300 separating them , it follows that any focal element ( either point or line ) implies the existence of a polar focal element ( line or point ) ; thus any conic of one of the three given type pairs may be considered as a conic of any other prescribed type pair . and",
    "further , as the distance between two antipodal points is constant @xmath301 , by changing a focus @xmath302 to its antipodal point @xmath303 , ( which according to the definition is again a focus of the conic ) , an hyperbola with focus @xmath284 , will be as well an ellipse with focus @xmath304 . a similar possibility exists for focal lines which may be changed to their antipodal lines , with coorientation changed .",
    "thus all spherical conics can be seen as _ spherical ellipses _ , including the two particular zero focal separation cases , i.e. , circles ( spherical parallel circles ) and pairs of lines ( a pair of intersecting large circles in the sphere ) .",
    "for the purposes of getting a common view we may still think in three generic types , keeping in mind that all three coincide and there is complete freedom in understanding a given spherical conic as either an ellipse , or a parabola or a hyperbola ( just as a geodesic circle can be seen at the same time as a geodesic circle , with center at @xmath20 or as an equidistant curve to the polar of @xmath20 ) ; more on this will be said later .    in the euclidean plane @xmath22 ultraellipses and ultrahyperbolas ( with any focal angle @xmath305 )",
    "are just pairs of parallel lines , in directions parallel to the two bisectors of the focal angle ; in the standard algebraic classification of euclidean conics these appear as degenerate conics .",
    "but when compared to @xmath234 or @xmath277 , another more important degeneracy happens in @xmath22 : two families of parabolas with the same focus and any two parallel focal lines will coincide ( because a pair of parallel lines are equidistant in @xmath22 ) .",
    "this means that the _ parabolic focal separation _ between the focus and the focal line can be chosen arbitrarily for a fixed euclidean parabola , which only determines its focus and the direction of the focal line . as a consequence parabolas",
    "are no longer generic conics in @xmath22 .",
    "while parabolas have always some intermediate status between ellipses and hyperbolas , in the euclidean case parabolas appears exclusively as limiting cases between ellipses and hyperbolas , and not as the full fledged species of conics they are in the generic @xmath294 case .",
    "the hyperbolic case @xmath277 with _ negative _ constant curvature is richer .",
    "the limiting conics obtained from a ellipse / hyperbola through a point @xmath306 when a focus stays fixed and the other goes to infinity are called _ horoellipse / horohyperbola_. the limiting conics obtained from a ultraellipse / ultrahyperbola through a point @xmath306 when a focal line stays fixed and the other goes to infinity are called _ horoultraellipse / horoultrahyperbola_. these four types of conics are also limiting forms of parabolas , with either focus fixed and focal line going to infinity , or focal line fixed and focus going to infinity . in @xmath22",
    "all these limiting conics collapse precisely to either euclidean parabolas or pairs of lines .",
    "there are more limiting conics in @xmath277 : the _ horocycle _ , obtained either from a circle through @xmath306 when its center goes to infinity , or from an ultracircle through @xmath306 when the baseline goes to infinity , and the _ osculating parabola _ , the limit of a parabola when the focus go to infinity along the fixed focal line .",
    "in order to make contact with the results in the dynamical part , let us draw our attention precisely on the conics with a proper focus .",
    "from now on we completely disregard ultraellipses and ultrahyperbolas , which have two focal lines , and osculating parabolas , which have not a proper focus .",
    "we consider exclusively ellipses / hyperbolas and parabolas , as well as their limiting cases horoellipses and horohyperbolas and particular cases circles , lines and equiparabolas corresponding to vanishing focal separations. all these conics have a proper focus , which we may place at the origin point , as well as another focal element , which may be another focus or a focal line . in either case",
    "the conics have as a symmetry axis the line joining the two foci or going through the focus and orthogonal to the focal line . to match with the familiar euclidean expressions ,",
    "we introduce polar coordinates in @xmath234 , @xmath22 , @xmath277 , taking the origin at the fixed focus and the symmetry axis of the conic as the half - line @xmath307 . with this choice ,",
    "the common equation of the whole family of conics described above may be written in the form : @xmath308 with @xmath214 and @xmath217 non - negative .",
    "this can be derived by trigonometric considerations from the definition of the conic in the space of constant curvature @xmath0 using the relations given in @xcite and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "this relation justifies the claim made in sec .  5 : the orbits of the kepler problem in either @xmath234 , @xmath22 , @xmath277 , are conics with a focus at the origin of the potential .",
    "the dependence on the polar angle @xmath21 is exactly the same as in the euclidean case and this may suggest to consider @xmath217 as the non - euclidean analogue of the _ eccentricity of the conic _ , though when @xmath294 the link between the values of @xmath217 and the _ type _ of the conic is not so direct as in @xmath22 .",
    "we should mention that there are at least two other quantities keeping different properties of the euclidean eccentricity , and no single quantity keeps all properties ; in this paper we will only be concerned with @xmath217 , and for brevity we shall refer to it as eccentricity .    for an ellipse / hyperbola with focal distance @xmath285 and @xmath282 as the sum / difference of distances to the focus , and for a parabola with focal separation @xmath290 and @xmath286 as sum / difference of distances to focus and focal line , the eccentricities turn out to be @xmath309 reducing in the euclidean @xmath5 case to the well known @xmath310 for ellipses / hyperbolas and @xmath311 for parabolas .    in the polar coordinate system @xmath312 , when @xmath3 or @xmath5 , the range of values of @xmath313 is the whole real line ( completed with @xmath314 ) , but when @xmath4 , the values of @xmath313 are confined to the interval @xmath315 $ ] , or to @xmath316 $ ] if negative values for @xmath19 are allowed along the opposite semi - axis according to the usual practice .",
    "now , for the conic ( [ coniceq1 ] ) the minimum value for @xmath19 happens when @xmath307 .",
    "this means that @xmath214 and @xmath217 are independent constants when @xmath317 but must fulfil the inequality @xmath318 when @xmath4 .",
    "notice that in ( [ coniceq1 ] ) the periastron of the orbit is placed on the semi - axis @xmath307 at @xmath319 , and thus @xmath320 is related to @xmath214 and @xmath217 by @xmath321 which for any value of @xmath0 has always a unique root for @xmath320 .",
    "next , let us look for the intersection of the conic with the line orthogonal to the conic symmetry axis through the focus , which corresponds to @xmath322 .",
    "the distance between this intersection point and the focus is traditionally called _ semilatus rectum _ of the conic ( in the euclidean case ) and will be denoted by @xmath323 . for @xmath5 all euclidean conics ( except the limiting double straight line with @xmath324 ) intersect this semilatus line . for any @xmath294 , @xmath323 would satisfy @xmath325 but there is a difference between the cases with @xmath317 or @xmath25 .",
    "while for @xmath3 , any @xmath214 will determine a unique @xmath323 , when @xmath4 this equation will define a real semilatus rectum only when @xmath326 , the semilatus rectum will be formally infinite when @xmath327 and will not exist at all when @xmath328 .",
    "this means that in the case of the hyperbolic plane @xmath277 the family of conics we are considering includes conics intersecting the ` semilatus ' line at a proper point , only at infinity or not intersecting at all .",
    "we have arrived to the following situation : all conics with given fixed focus and symmetry axis intersect this line in @xmath234 , exactly one does not intersect in @xmath22 and an infinite number of them do not intersect in @xmath277 .    thus , when @xmath317 the equation of the complete family of conics we are considering is @xmath329 but in the negative curvature case @xmath4 , there will be some conics precisely those with @xmath328 not described under ( [ conics2 ] ) . to cater for these cases it will prove useful to introduce another real distance @xmath330 , complementary to the ideal semilatus rectum , related to @xmath214 by @xmath331 and in terms of this choice , when @xmath4 the equation of the complete family of conics we are considering is given by one of the two mutually exclusive possibilities @xmath332 where the ranges are @xmath333 and @xmath334 respectively .",
    "the conic @xmath335 is the common limit @xmath336 and @xmath337 of ( [ conich2 ] ) .",
    "notice the two expressions ( [ conich2 ] ) can be used as well when @xmath3 but then each of the two alternatives covers actually all cases , and are then redundant . only the first possibility in ( [ conich2 ] )",
    "has a sensible euclidean limit because the @xmath233 limit of the @xmath330 family gives a straight line at the infinity of the euclidean plane ; thus the family @xmath330 as a set of conics different from the @xmath323 family is specific to the hyperbolic plane .",
    "now the only remaining problem is to link the values of the two parameters @xmath214 and @xmath217 to the type the conic belongs .",
    "when is such a conic an ellipse , a parabola or a hyperbola according to their definitions in the space of curvature @xmath0 ? when is it a particular conic , either a circle , a equiparabola or a line ? and finally , only for the hyperbolic plane @xmath277 , when is it a limiting horoellipse or horohyperbola ?    in the euclidean plane the answer is well known and easy : the conic type depends _ only _ on @xmath217 , and not on @xmath323 .",
    "this is _ not so",
    "_ when @xmath294 .",
    "a given conic in @xmath234 will have a unique and well defined parameter @xmath217 in ( [ conics2 ] ) .",
    "but labelling it as an ellipse , or parabola or hyperbola , requires to choose a particular set of two focal elements , and a @xmath338 sign to decide between the sum or difference in the definitions .",
    "unlike on @xmath277 where these choices are unique , for the sphere they may be made in several ways . by means of suitable choices ,",
    "_ any spherical conic with any @xmath339 _ may be considered as an ellipse , as a parabola or as a hyperbola .",
    "this is an unavoidable consequence of the definitions , which are clearly natural ones for non - zero curvature .",
    "if we want to classify conics in @xmath1 into three _ disjoint _ species , this would require adopting an additional convention ( somehow bypassing the definition ) , which may be chosen in several reasonable ways , but which nevertheless remains as a convention .    a possibility would be to class spherical ellipses with @xmath340 as ` ellipses ' , those with @xmath341 as ` parabolas ' , and those with @xmath342 as ` hyperbolas ' .",
    "this is the convention adopted by higgs @xcite who formulated it according to the property of not crossing , touching or crossing the equator , which can be easily shown to be equivalent to the requirement @xmath343 , @xmath341 , or @xmath342 , respectively .",
    "another different convention follows from the fact that any ellipse / hiperbola with focus @xmath284 ( and focal separation @xmath285 ) can also be considered as a hyperbola / ellipse with focus @xmath304 ( and focal separation @xmath344 ) .",
    "the sum of the two focal half - separations @xmath345 and @xmath346 is @xmath300 , this is , the length of a quadrant on the sphere .",
    "thus , we may consider as ` ellipses ' exclusively those spherical ellipses with a value of the focal separation @xmath285 less than a quadrant , that is , @xmath347 , and as ` hyperbolas ' exclusively those spherical ellipses with a value of @xmath285 greater than a quadrant , that is , @xmath348 . within this convention , and if we want artificially enforce non - redundancy , the name ` parabolas ' will only be left for the spherical ellipses with precisely @xmath349 , which in our previous nomenclature were called equiparabola ( as @xmath349 between two focus means that one focus will be incident with the the polar of the other focus , which is the focal line ) .",
    "in this view ` ellipses ' are completely contained in the half - sphere with center at the ellipse center , while ` hyperbolas ' will go through the boundary of the half - sphere centered at the hyperbola center .",
    "the case of the hyperbolic plane @xmath277 is different and there is no conventionality in it . in the following paragraphs we are implicitly assuming @xmath4 .",
    "when is the conic ( [ conich2 ] ) an _ ellipse _ ?",
    "in addition to the actual vertex at the point of closest approach to the focus , placed on the @xmath307 axis , ellipses will have another vertex , placed on the @xmath350 semi - axis with a _ positive _ value for @xmath351 which anyhow should belong to the interval @xmath352 $ ] .",
    "the lower bound in this interval corresponds to circular orbits while the upper places the apoastron at the infinity , and the ellipse will go to an _ horoellipse_. it is easy to conclude that the positivity condition requires @xmath217 to be in the interval @xmath353 $ ] and then @xmath354 $ ] only happens within the first alternative in ( [ conich2 ] ) , provided that the eccentricities lie in the interval @xmath355 notice this interval _ depends on @xmath323 _ and for any @xmath356 is strictly smaller than the euclidean one , which is recovered of course , when @xmath11 .",
    "the lower bound for @xmath217 corresponds to circular orbits , while the upper bound is the limiting value corresponding to _ horoellipses _",
    "@xmath357    when will the conic ( [ conich2 ] ) be an",
    "_ hyperbola _ ? in this case , in addition to the vertex at the periastron , the conic will have another vertex point ( on the other hyperbola branch , thus not actually on the physical orbit ) on the @xmath307 semi - axis , which will appear on the equation as a _ negative _ value for @xmath358 on the @xmath350 semi - axis .",
    "hence , the values of @xmath313 for @xmath350 must belong to the interval @xmath359 $ ] , with the lower value corresponding to _ horohyperbolas _ , and the upper value to lines . by using the same strategy ,",
    "it is easy to conclude that the negativity condition requires @xmath360 $ ] , and then @xmath351 may lie in the required interval in either of the two alternatives ( [ conich2 ] ) , with @xmath217 parameters respectively in the intervals @xmath361 notice both conditions lead to a common limit when @xmath362 , namely , @xmath363 for the conics ( [ conich2sep ] ) . here",
    "particular and limiting conics correspond to : @xmath364    once we have characterized the intervals of eccentricity for ellipses and hyperbolas , the remaining gap correspond to parabolas .",
    "thus , within the first family : @xmath365 and within the second @xmath366 the particular parabolas with zero focal separation , this is , the equiparabolas , corresponds to the values : @xmath367 and are different from the parabolas with @xmath341 .    this way we get the following result : conics ( [ conich2 ] ) in the hyperbolic plane @xmath2 , with a fixed value of @xmath323 may be either ellipses , parabolas or hyperbolas , according to the value of their eccentricity",
    "as follows @xmath368 and conics ( [ conich2 ] ) with a fixed @xmath330 may be only parabolas or hyperbolas : @xmath369 the most remarkable property is the existence , for a fixed value of the semilatus rectum @xmath323 , of a full interval of values for eccentricity corresponding to parabolas , including always two special values , @xmath370 and @xmath371 ; in the euclidean limit @xmath11 this interval collapses to the single value @xmath372 , and there is a single euclidean parabola for a given @xmath323 .",
    "now let us consider the complete family of conics corresponding to trajectories with a given _ periastron _ distance , say @xmath373 ; these would correspond to the trajectories of a particle launched orthogonally to the radial direction from a point at distance @xmath320 from the potential origin and with a given velocity . the corresponding pattern for the kepler problem in the euclidean case is well known : a circle , a family of ellipses of increasing eccentricity @xmath374 , a separating parabola , a family of hyperbolas of increasing eccentricity @xmath375 and finally a limiting straight line corresponding to infinite velocity .",
    "how about the analogue of this pattern in the non - zero curvature case ?",
    "first we require all conics will have a periastron at @xmath373 . within the two families",
    "the relation between @xmath323 or @xmath330 with @xmath373 is given by @xmath376 and , using these expression in the classification stated above , we get the landmark values of @xmath323 or @xmath330 corresponding to the different types of conic : @xmath377 which in the euclidean limit , with @xmath5 and @xmath378 , reduces to the well known : @xmath379 for the hyperbolic @xmath330 family , which has no euclidean limit , we have : @xmath380 figures 6a and 6b represent a set of kepler orbits in the hyperbolic plane @xmath2 .",
    "we have solved the kepler problem on the three spaces of constant curvature . as we have stated in the introduction ,",
    "one of the fundamental characteristic of this approach is the use of the curvature @xmath0 as a parameter . in this way , all the @xmath0-dependent properties that we have obtained reduce to the appropriate property for the system on the sphere @xmath1 , or the on hyperbolic plane @xmath2 , when particularized for @xmath3 , or @xmath4 , respectively ; in addition , the euclidean case arises as the very particular ( but important ) case @xmath5 .",
    "so , we can summarize this situation pointing out two important facts :    * the kepler problem is not a specific or special characteristic of the euclidean space but it is well defined in all the three spaces of constant curvature .",
    "* there are not three different kepler problems but only one that is defined , at the same time , in three different manifolds .    of course , since the three manifolds are geometrically different , many dynamical properties show differences according to the characteristics of the manifolds ; nevertheless , the important point is that there is only one theory that is simultaneously valid for the three manifolds and for any value of the curvature .",
    "we illustrate this situation recalling the following two important results :    * the equation of binet remains true in the three cases .",
    "* the orbits are conics in the three cases .",
    "it is well known that the classical euclidean kepler problem is one of the systems endowed with more interesting properties .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to study , all of them , in the general non - euclidean @xmath92 case ; as an example , we have made use , in sec . 4 , of two constants of motion , @xmath187 and @xmath188 , that represent the @xmath0-dependent version of the runge - lenz vector .",
    "the runge - lenz vector plays a very important role in the euclidean case , so it is natural to suppose that the same situation will be true for the case of the general ` curved ' system .",
    "in fact , we think that , as the euclidean system is just a very particular case of a much more general system , all the euclidean characteristics , that are obtained and discussed in the books of theoretical mechanics , must admit a @xmath0-dependent deformed version appropriate for the general  curved \" system .",
    "we think that these questions are open problems that must be investigated .",
    "we also note that in all this paper we have only dealt with the two - dimensional case since we assumed that it arises from a reduction of the three - dimensional kepler problem on @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; this dimensional reduction is worthy of a further study .",
    "finally , the analysis of the orbits has led us , in a natural way , to the theory of conics on spaces of constant curvature .",
    "notice that , although secs .",
    "3 and 4 were mainly concerned with dynamical questions , sec .",
    "5 was written emphasizing its geometrical character ; in fact , it can be considered by itself and independently of the other previous sections .",
    "it is clear that the theory of conics on spaces of constant curvature is a geometrical matter of great importance deserving a deeper study that we hope to present elsewhere . on the one hand , there exist some general points and basic properties that , although perfectly known and clearly stated in the euclidean plane , remain to be studied in the case of spaces of constant curvature ; on the other hand , we have already obtained some particular points as , for example , the existence several different parabolas in the hyperbolic plane , or the possibility of some different alternative ways of defining the eccentricity for a conic in a @xmath92 space , which are really noteworthy .",
    "these geometrical questions are also open problems to be investigated .",
    "a two  dimensional manifold @xmath381 can be described by using different coordinate systems .",
    "if we consider it as an imbedded submanifold of @xmath382 , then the points of @xmath381 can be characterized by the three external coordinates , as @xmath383 or @xmath384 , plus an additional constraint relation .",
    "nevertheless , in differential geometric terms , a more appropriate approach is to develop the study by using two  dimensional systems of coordinates adapted to @xmath381 .    on any general two ",
    "dimensional riemannian space , not necessarily of constant curvature , there are two distinguished types of local coordinate systems :  geodesic parallel \" and  geodesic polar \" coordinates .",
    "they reduce to the familiar cartesian and polar coordinates on the euclidean plane ( see refs . @xcite and @xcite ) and",
    "both are based on a origin point @xmath20 and a oriented geodesic @xmath385 through @xmath20 .    for any point @xmath306 in some suitable neighbourhood of @xmath20 ,",
    "there is a unique geodesic @xmath386 joining @xmath306 with @xmath20 .",
    "the ( geodesic ) polar coordinates @xmath18 of @xmath306 , relative to the origin @xmath20 and the positive geodesic ray of @xmath385 , are the ( positive ) distance @xmath19 between @xmath306 and @xmath20 measured along @xmath386 , and the angle @xmath21 between @xmath386 and the positive ray @xmath385 , measured around @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "these coordinates are defined in a neighbourhood of @xmath20 not extending beyond the cut locus of @xmath20 ; polar coordinates are singular at @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is discontinuous on the positive ray of @xmath385 .    in the case of @xmath381 being a space of constant curvature @xmath0 , the expression for the differential element of distance @xmath35 is given by @xmath387 so that we get @xmath388 for the particular @xmath5 euclidean case .",
