    "however , solving the respective exact quantum dynamics is possible for only a few particles , even for only weakly interacting gases , thus making approximations necessary .",
    "+   + one of the main theoretical tools in the field of ultracold bosons is the gross - pitaevskii equation , a field equation for the bose - einstein condensate wave function in terms of a mean - field approximation , providing accurate results on limited timescales for low temperatures and for large numbers of particles @xmath0 .",
    "however , replacing the field operators by a _",
    "c_-number field means that some truly quantum phenomena ( such as wave packet revivals ) can not be described and the mean - field approach quickly ceases to be valid - especially for strong interactions @xcite .",
    "hence , this article deals with the question whether a _",
    "semiclassical _ treatment can improve the classical mean field gross - pitaevskii approach and existing extensions thereof .",
    "+   + semiclassical methods are widely applied in the energy picture , in terms of the wkb and related approximations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "time - dependent semiclassical propagators have a long history , going back to van vleck @xcite , especially in the field of molecular dynamics . besides the van - vleck - gutzwiller propagator @xcite , which is based on a classical boundary value problem , the so - called herman - kluk ( hk ) propagator is frequently applied @xcite , providing the advantage of relying on a classical initial value problem , thus avoiding the expensive root - finding task . + the propagator turns out to depend on classical information only , similar to the popular truncated wigner approximation ( twa ) , which is employed to describe the full quantum field dynamics as well .",
    "however , the semiclassical propagator goes beyond the twa by considering the coherences of the contributions of the classical trajectories , without implicating major additional expenses . in the following",
    "we will refer to the twa as the `` classical approximation '' .",
    "+   + to test the applicability of the hk propagator in the field of ultracold bosons , we consider as model systems ultracold bosons in a double- and triple - well potential , which allows for an exact calculation of the dynamics in the bose - hubbard framework for a comparison of the results .",
    "for the former , experiments exist which confirm the two - mode picture @xcite on the one hand , and a number of articles dealing with the discussion of the consequences of the mean - field approximation and many - body corrections @xcite on the other .",
    "furthermore , ( time - independent ) semiclassical methods have been applied successfully to the two - mode model , with wkb methods leading the way @xcite , showing that semiclassical methods are a promising tool . in this article",
    ", we want to discuss the application of the ( explicitly time - dependent ) semiclassical herman - kluk propagator for ultracold bosons .",
    "semiclassical approximations are expected to be valid in the limit @xmath1 , or more precisely when @xmath2 is small compared to characteristic actions of the system . for the quantum many - body systems of interest here ,",
    "one usually starts from the second - quantized many - body hamiltonian for ultracold bosons @xmath3 with the external potential @xmath4 and the interaction parameter @xmath5 ( depending on the @xmath6-wave scattering length @xmath7 ) . by normalizing the bosonic field operators to the square root of the particle number in the hamiltonian ( [ eq_many_body_ham ] )",
    "it becomes clear that semiclassical methods are expected to be valid in the limit @xmath8 the so - called classical limit @xcite , in which the gross - pitaevskii ground state is exact .",
    "indeed , this limit is reasonable in the field of ultracold bosonic gases , since most of the experiments involve many weakly interacting particles .",
    "+   + in this article , we first review the semiclassical herman - kluk propagator in detail as well as the commonly applied truncated wigner approximation for a comparison between the semiclassical and the classical methods . afterwards , we discuss the double - well system and its semiclassical dynamics , finding good agreement with the exact dynamics for almost all parameter regimes .",
    "we show that the semiclassical results outmatch the classical mean field and twa results clearly . finally , the last section deals with the dynamics of ultracold bosons in a triple - well potential .",
    "again , the semiclassical results are compared to the exact dynamics and the twa .",
    "we come to the conclusion that semiclassics is superior to the twa , but both approaches are in accordance with the exact dynamics on only fairly short timescales , because of the mixed phase space of the triple - well system .",
    "the time evolution of an initial wave function @xmath9 can be expressed by means of the quantum mechanical propagator @xmath10 according to @xmath11 if the typical actions involved in the system are large compared to @xmath2 , the propagator can be approximated semiclassically employing fixed width ( so - called frozen ) gaussian wave packets @xmath12 , centered around the phase space points @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting propagator was developed by herman and kluk @xcite , based on previous work done by heller @xcite , and brought back to the center of attention by kay @xcite .",
    "the so - called herman - kluk propagator applied to an initial gaussian state @xmath15 reads @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "it is integrated over phase space points @xmath18 being the initial conditions of the propagated classical trajectories @xmath19 .",
    "the normalized gaussian states in position space are @xmath20 where the parameter @xmath21 determines the width of the gaussians , and the overlap of two states can be calculated analytically to @xmath22    if the widths of the two gaussians @xmath21 are equal . the phase of the integrand in eq .",

    "the hk prefactor weights the contribution of particular trajectories depending on their stability with respect to slightly different initial conditions . unlike in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a semiclassical propagator based on a boundary value problem is applied to the dynamics of ultracold bosons in a lattice , the advantage of the hk propagator is that the classical information appears in terms of an initial value problem .",
    "the twa constitutes another widely used method to simulate the dynamics of out of equilibrium becs .",
    "its application to becs was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite as an alternative to go beyond gross - pitaevskii theory .",
    "the method is based on the wigner representation of the density operator whose time evolution is given by the von - neumann equation .",
    "for an ultracold bosonic gas the time evolution of the wigner function contains first- and third - order derivatives with respect to the classical field @xcite , such that a direct integration of the equation of motion is impractical and difficult . to avoid this difficulty , the higher derivatives are typically truncated , leading to a classical liouville equation for the time - evolution of the wigner function @xcite .",
    "so , each classical field of an ensemble of fields , which samples the wigner function of the initial density operator of the gas , is evolved by means of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "even though the classical equation of motion is completely deterministic , quantum noise is still included in the initial state represented by a distribution of classical fields .",
    "the twa turned out to be a good approximation for large numbers of particles and to be exact in the classical limit ( [ class_limit ] ) @xcite , provided the corresponding wigner function is sufficiently smooth . if not",
    ", the third order derivatives can become relevant .",
    "then semiclassical methods presented here in form of the hk propagator , and also relying on `` classical information '' only become preferable .",
    "to which extent the semiclassical methods outmatch the twa is investigated on the basis of ultracold bosons in a double - well and a triple - well potential in the following sections .",
    "a bose - einstein condensate in a symmetric double - well potential can be described for low temperatures by means of the two - mode approximation @xcite . starting from the many - body hamiltonian ( [ eq_many_body_ham ] ) , after some approximations",
    "the corresponding second - quantized many - body two - site bose - hubbard hamiltonian reads @xmath27 with creation and annihilation operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 for a boson in the @xmath30th potential well , which obey the usual bosonic commutation rules @xmath31=\\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "@xmath32 denotes the tunnelling amplitude , which depends on the barrier height @xcite , and @xmath33 measures the on - site two - body interaction strength depending on the @xmath6-wave scattering length .",
    "the bose - hubbard hamiltonian describes the dynamics of bosons in a double - well properly for small interaction energies compared to the level spacing of the trap potential @xcite , such that only the two lowest - lying modes have to be considered .",
    "+ according to the bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( [ eq_bh ] ) there are three qualitatively different regimes with respect to crucial features of energy spectrum and resulting dynamics @xcite .",
    "the regimes are easily explained by introducing the parameter @xmath34 with the total number of particles in the system @xmath0 . on the basis of @xmath35 , the rabi regime ( @xmath36 )",
    "can be distinguished from the josephson- ( @xmath37 ) and the fock regime ( @xmath38 ) @xcite .",
    "+ the rabi regime can be identified with the non - interacting , classical limit @xmath39 , when the bosons move approximately independently of each other .",
    "the resulting spectrum is almost harmonic , such that after an initial tilt of the system the bosons oscillate with the well - known plasma frequency @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "+ the energy spectrum in the fock regime only consists of doublets with a quasidegenerate symmetric and antisymmetric eigenstate . thus ,",
    "the dynamics of the mean population of the potential wells is extremely slow ( self - trapping ) .",
    "+ the josephson regime combines the features of both spectra just discussed . here , we distinguish the plasma - oscillating regime with @xmath41 and the self - trapping regime with @xmath42 . in the former ,",
    "the energy eigenstates correspond to an ( anharmonic ) oscillator spectrum and the population imbalance oscillates around zero , while in the latter regime the eigenstates appear as doublets leading to self - trapping again , and thus , to a mean population imbalance unequal zero .",
    "so , in the josephson regime the dynamics depend crucially on the energy of the initial state , which is adjusted experimentally by initially tilting the potential @xcite : the system is prepared in the ground state @xmath43 of the tilted potential , which is then quickly switched back to a symmetric potential and the bosons can evolve in time . +   + though",
    "the double - well system is a simple system , the resulting dynamics are interesting due to the interplay of tunnelling and interaction among the bosons .",
    "this leads to sequences of oscillations , collapses , and revivals of the population imbalance and the relative phase , which we address later in this article .      for a large total number of particles @xmath0 the bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( [ eq_bh ] )",
    "can be simplified in the mean - field picture by replacing the annihilation and creation operators by complex numbers @xcite @xmath44 with the number of particles @xmath45 and phase @xmath46 in the @xmath30-th well . by introducing the population imbalance @xmath47 and the phase difference @xmath48 between the two wells , one finds the hamilton function @xmath49 which also arises from the mean - field gross - pitaevskii functional in the two - mode case @xcite .",
    "the population imbalance and relative phase are canonically conjugate and the corresponding classical dynamics follow hamilton s equations of motion @xmath50 the dynamics of the reduced quantities @xmath51 and @xmath52 have been studied by several groups in this `` classical picture '' @xcite , in particular the differences between the classical and the quantum dynamics @xcite . though the purely classical description can clearly not describe the mentioned collapses and revivals of the population imbalance , it is able to give some indication of e.g. the transition from the plasma oscillating to the self - trapping regime and the order of magnitudes of the oscillation frequencies .",
    "only recently the phase space region near the classical bifurcation was investigated experimentally with ultra cold @xmath53 atoms @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the classical description has been the basis of successful semiclassical investigations @xcite in the framework of wkb methods .",
    "motivated by this preliminary work we want to move over to time - dependent semiclassical methods ( namely the hk propagation ) to describe the dynamics of the out - of - equilibrium ultracold bosons in the double - well potential .      the wigner representation can be written in the number - phase picture @xcite .",
    "for a large number of particles , the differential equations can be truncated leading to a classical liouville equation for the wigner function @xmath54 with the classical hamilton function ( [ eq_class_h ] ) .",
    "again , the difference to the purely classical treatment in section [ sec_class_descr ] is that the distribution of the initial state is included : the whole wigner function is propagated by means of the sampled single trajectories , that follow the classical equations ( [ eqofmotion ] ) of section [ sec_class_descr ] .",
    "since the initial state in the heidelberg experiment @xcite is almost a gaussian in @xmath55 ( being the ground state of the tilted system which can be calculated likewise semiclassically @xcite ) , it seems to be natural to apply an initial value propagator to the system , namely the hk propagator .",
    "the canonically conjugate population imbalance and relative phase can be identified with position and momentum variables @xmath56 though @xmath51 and @xmath52 are finite variables , they can be considered as ordinary canonical variables in the limit @xmath57 .",
    "so , computing the hk propagator for the double - well system amounts to solving seven coupled equations of motion , namely hamilton s equations of motion ( [ eqofmotion ] ) , the time evolution of the action , and four equations of motion for the entries of the monodromy matrix ( [ eq_monodromy ] ) , and solving the integral in ( [ eq_hk ] ) by monte - carlo integration . instead of sampling over the whole phase space ,",
    "a gaussian importance sampling is sufficient due to the gaussian overlap ( [ eq_overlap ] ) of the coherent states .",
    "so , the computational effort is increased only slightly compared to twa methods , though the quantum coherences of the contributions of the different trajectories are included by means of the phases @xmath58 .",

    "the latter is displayed in fig .",
