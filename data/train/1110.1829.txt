    "magellanic cloud pne ( mcpne ) are the nearest large population of extragalactic pne where the low reddening and favourable viewing angle allows for population - wide studies not possible in the milky way .",
    "the most important of these is the extragalactic standard candle [ o  iii ] pnlf in which mcpne serve as the benchmark population ( ciardullo et al .",
    "however , until a detailed multi - wavelength analysis of mcpne to remove contaminating non - pne is performed , their acclaimed benchmark status could be considered uncertain .",
    "the deep @xmath0 photometry of the vmc survey will allow for a thorough appraisal of the majority of mcpne for the first time .",
    "miszalski et al . ( 2011b ) performed a multi - wavelength analysis of 102 objects using vmc data ( cioni et al .",
    "2011 ) and a host of mid - infrared and optical observations . a total 46/67 or 69% of objects in our sample from reid & parker ( 2006b ) were reclassified as non - pne ( hii regions , field stars , emission line stars , symbiotic stars and a young stellar object ) .",
    "these results are numerically dominated by the complex 30 doradus region and some reclassifications may be explained by the relatively low survey resolution of reid & parker ( 2006a ) .",
    "miszalski et al .",
    "( 2011b ) developed a range of diagnostic diagrams ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) to guide future analysis of larger samples of mcpne with the growing vmc dataset ( miszalski et al . in preparation ) .    the inclusion of ogle - iii @xmath2-band ( udalski et al .",
    "2008a , b ) and vmc @xmath3 lightcurves were a powerful means to firmly identify contaminating variable stars ( e.g. the mira rp793 with @xmath40.4 mag and 503.4 day period from ogle - iii ) .",
    "none of the variables identified had the multi - wavelength properties of typical pne , which underscores the importance of a clean pn population before searching for binary central stars .",
    "the large fraction of giant companions claimed by shaw et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is instead explained by the numerous field stars and emission line stars found by miszalski et al .",
    "( 2011b ) .",
    "( red ) , @xmath5 ( green ) and @xmath6 ( blue ) vmc images . ]",
    "the reid & parker ( 2010 ) [ o  iii ] pnlf of lmc pne is a substantial advance over previous work , however further effort is required to improve this important pnlf .",
    "firstly , only a small fraction of the sample has been cleaned of non - pne and secondly , there remain many undiscovered pne to be added .",
    "miszalski et al . ( 2011a ) found 23 new pne in a @xmath7 arcmin@xmath8 region not listed by reid & parker ( 2006b ) and concluded that perhaps 5075 new pne remain to be found in the inner @xmath9 deg@xmath8 of the lmc .",
    "reid & parker ( these proceedings ) report on new pne found outside this zone using optical selection criteria .",
    "optical searches may not find all pne as demonstrated by mnc4 ( miszalski et al .",
    "2011a ) whose [ wc9 ] or later central star is too cool to ionise [ o  iii ] . with more vmc data we will build nir pnlfs to complement the [ o  iii ] pnlf .",
