    "the unification of the fundamental forces of the standard model ( sm ) is one of the guiding principles in the search for a more fundamental theory of nature .",
    "in addition to providing a unified origin of the gauge interactions , grand unified theories ( guts ) , based e.g.  on the gauge symmetry groups su(5 ) @xcite or so(10 ) @xcite , also unify quarks and leptons of the sm in representations of the unified gauge groups .",
    "this property makes them attractive frameworks to address the flavour problem , i.e.  the question of the origin of the observed pattern of fermion masses and mixings .",
    "another attractive feature of left - right symmetric guts is the appearance of right - handed neutrinos in their particle spectra , which become massive after spontaneous symmetry breaking to the sm and thereby lead to the small observed neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism @xcite . in order to solve the gauge hierarchy problem inherent in high - energy extensions of the sm and to make the running gauge couplings meet ( at the so - called gut scale @xmath6 gev ) , the idea of grand unification is typically combined with that of low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) .    in order to construct successful gut models of flavour , it is desirable to know the approximate gut scale values of the quark and lepton masses and mixing parameters . the experimental data on the masses of the strange quark and the muon , for example , extrapolated to the gut scale by means of renormalisation group ( rg ) running within the sm , gave rise to the so - called georgi jarlskog ( gj ) relations @xcite of @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the gut scale , which can be realised from a clebsch - gordan factor after gut symmetry breaking .",
    "the gj relations have become a popular building block in many classes of unified flavour models . in susy guts ,",
    "another intriguing possibility emerges , which is the unification of all third family yukawa couplings , i.e.  of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and furthermore , in the context of the seesaw mechanism , of @xmath12 at the gut scale . to investigate whether this relation can be realised in a given model of low - energy susy",
    ", it is well known that a careful inclusion of susy threshold corrections is required @xcite .",
    "these threshold effects are particularly relevant in the case of large @xmath13 , where @xmath14 seems achievable . despite the possible importance of the susy threshold effects , in studies which interpolate the running fermion masses to the gut scale these effects",
    "are typically ignored ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of susy threshold corrections on the possibility of third family yukawa unification @xmath14 ( and also on the less restrictive possibility @xmath15 which often emerges in su(5 ) guts ) has been extensively studied in the literature ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , recent studies @xcite have addressed the phenomenological viability of this relation and have pointed out that under certain assumptions on the soft breaking parameters at the gut scale , @xmath14 may be already quite challenged by the experimental data from b physics .",
    "susy threshold effects on the gj relations have been discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "taking into account the typically leading contribution from susy qcd loops , it has been shown that the gj relation can be realised under certain conditions on the susy parameters which govern this correction .",
    "the main purpose of this study is to include susy threshold corrections and calculate the possible gut scale ranges for quark and charged lepton yukawa couplings as well as for the ratios @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are important input parameters for gut model building .",
    "regarding @xmath1 , compared to @xcite we include additional corrections from electroweak loops with binos and winos for quarks and charged leptons , which , as we will show , can have significant impact .",
    "furthermore , instead of trying to fit the gj relations by a sparticle spectrum , our aim is to analyse which alternative gut scale relations may be possible and whether the gj relation lies within the projected gut scale ranges .",
    "we also investigate other relevant quantities of interest for gut model building , such as , for example , the ratio of electron mass over down quark mass , @xmath2 , and of the third family yukawa couplings @xmath16 and @xmath11 .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we discuss the various @xmath0-enhanced contributions to the susy threshold corrections and how we implement them within the renormalisation group running procedure of the yukawa couplings .",
    "section 3 contains our results for the gut scale ranges for the quark and charged lepton yukawa couplings as well as for the ratios @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and in section 4 we discuss possible implications for gut model building .",
    "section 5 concludes the paper .",
    "for large @xmath13 in the mssm it is well known that certain supersymmetric one - loop corrections are enhanced ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the feynman diagrams corresponding to these one - loop corrections are shown in figures [ fig : quarks ] and [ fig : leptons ] .",

    "for instance , @xmath25 labels the gluino with mass @xmath26 , @xmath27 the bino with mass @xmath28 and @xmath29 the wino with mass @xmath30 .    ]    ]    after matching the sm with the mssm at the susy scale at one - loop @xcite , we obtain for the affected yukawa couplings of down - type quarks and charged leptons @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the sm yukawa coupling related to the @xmath33-mass @xmath34 of the respective particle . with @xmath35 and @xmath36 being the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the up - type and down - type higgs doublets ,",
    "@xmath13 is defined as @xmath37 and the vev @xmath38 of the sm higgs is given by @xmath39 .",
    "the quantities @xmath40 which govern the @xmath0-enhanced corrections , with @xmath22 = @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , will be specified in section [ sec : corrections ] .",
    "note that since the calculation is one - loop , we can use @xmath33-quantities as well as @xmath47-quantities . for large @xmath13",
    "the correction @xmath48 can become quite large , so higher order calculations seem to be necessary , however it can be shown that the @xmath13-enhanced vertex corrections are absent in higher orders @xcite . in the following , we will restrict ourselves to the case of large @xmath13 .",
    "for the up - type quarks ( and neutrinos ) there are no @xmath13-enhanced corrections , and the remaining corrections are negligibly small",
    ". we will therefore match the up - type quark yukawa couplings using the tree - level relation @xmath49 , with @xmath22 = @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "for the neutrino sector we will assume that the small masses are generated by the ( type i ) seesaw mechanism @xcite operating at high energies close to the gut scale . in the following , we will drop the mssm - label for the yukawa couplings and imply @xmath53 .",
    "we give now explicit formulae for the quantities @xmath40 in equation ( [ eq : matching ] ) , which in addition to @xmath13 govern the size of the threshold corrections .",
    "details of the calculation for the quarks can be found in @xcite .",
    "the formulae are valid for the case of unbroken @xmath54 symmetry , which is appropriate for the situation that the sparticle masses are in the tev range and that we use matching conditions at these high energies above the electroweak ( ew ) scale @xmath55 .",
    "turning to the corrections for the down - type quarks we can decompose @xmath56 , with @xcite @xmath57 , \\\\",

    "the correction @xmath64 is only relevant for the @xmath43-quarks because of the strong hierarchy of the quark yukawa couplings .",
    "the function @xmath65 is defined as @xmath66 note that @xmath65 is negative for positive @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 is maximal , if its arguments are minimal , and vice versa .",
    "the corrections for the charged leptons stem from diagrams similar to the ones for the quarks and are shown in figure [ fig : leptons ] .",
    "one difference between the corrections for quarks and charged leptons is of course that the susy qcd loop contributions @xmath70 are absent .",
    "another difference concerns the contributions @xmath71 with binos in the loops , where due to the different hypercharge of the charged leptons the prefactors for these contributions are changed . in the last term in equation ( [ eq : expl_bino ] )",
    "this causes an enhancement by a factor of @xmath72 compared to the corresponding term in the quark sector in equation ( [ eq : expq_bino ] ) .",
    "the contribution from the diagrams with winos @xmath73 , on the other hand , is equal for quarks and leptons .",
    "a further difference between the corrections for quarks and charged leptons is that in the considered seesaw framework the @xmath46-lepton yukawa coupling does not have a relevant correction of the @xmath64 type because the corresponding vertex correction is suppressed by the heavy mass scale of the right - handed neutrinos . for the corrections for the charged leptons we find @xmath74 , \\\\",

    "the calculation of the yukawa couplings of the quarks and charged leptons at the gut scale can be accomplished by solving the corresponding renormalisation group equations ( rges ) in the ( type i ) seesaw scenario from low - energy to the gut scale . for this",
    "we use the package reap introduced in @xcite , where also a summary of the relevant rges can be found .    for our analysis , we take as input values the running quark and lepton masses at the top scale @xmath76 , which have been calculated recently in @xcite with up - to - date experimental values for the low - energy quark and charged lepton masses , and evolve them first to the susy scale @xmath77 using the sm rges . at the susy scale",
    "we match the sm with the mssm to obtain the running @xmath33 yukawa couplings via equation ( [ eq : matching ] ) . since we consider one - loop running , we can neglect issues of scheme dependence such as transformations from @xmath33 to @xmath47 quantities .",
    "two - loop running ( and scheme - dependent ) effects are small compared to the @xmath13-enhanced threshold corrections and can be neglected .",
    "as the next step , we solve the rges from the susy scale to @xmath78 taking into account possible intermediate right - handed neutrino thresholds as discussed in @xcite . for our numerical calculations we use",
    "reap , which solves the complete set of one - loop rges and automatically includes the right - handed neutrino thresholds .",
    "we will comment on the possible effects of right - handed neutrino thresholds , which depend on the additional degrees of freedom in seesaw models , in section [ sec : rhnus ] .",
    "if not stated otherwise , they are ignored in our analysis .",
    "we note that there are susy scenarios which may lead to corrections to our approach of one - step matching at the susy scale in the ew unbroken phase .",
    "for example , if the sparticle spectrum is light , effects of ew symmetry breaking may have to be taken into account for the calculation of the susy threshold corrections .",
    "another example is the possibility of having a ( relatively ) split sparticle spectrum , in which case matching at one scale would be a bad approximation .",
    "when we present explicit examples in the following , we choose parameters where our assumptions are justified to a good approximation .",
    "in this part we present our analytical and numerical results . we start with a semianalytic discussion of the individual contributions to the threshold corrections presented in equations ( [ eq : expq ] ) to ( [ eq : expl_end ] ) , which allows to estimate their size as well as the size of the total corrections @xmath40 .",
    "we will then turn to the numerical analysis , where we quantitatively discuss the effect of the most relevant parameters and present our final results for the quark and charged lepton yukawa couplings ( and mass ratios ) at the gut scale . to isolate the effects of the susy ( mssm ) parameters from the uncertainties induced by the quark mass errors",
    ", we first use best - fit values for the low - energy fermion masses .",
    "these errors are later included in our final results presented in tables [ tab : ratfinal ] and [ tab : yukfinal ] .",
    "we note that the quark mass errors have a significant effect , whereas the charged lepton mass errors are negligibly small .",
    ".example ranges of susy parameters ( at the matching scale @xmath77 ) used in our analyses in sections [ sec : analytic ] and [ sec : scan ]",
    ". the choices of gaugino masses in the cases @xmath79 are inspired by universal gaugino masses at the gut scale and in case @xmath80 by anomaly - mediated susy breaking .",
    "we therefore use the low - energy approximation @xmath81 for the cases @xmath79 and @xmath82 for case @xmath80 as a constraint.[tab : susypar ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this study we have investigated the effect of susy threshold corrections on the values of the running quark and charged lepton yukawa couplings at the gut scale within the mssm in the large @xmath13 regime .",
    "we have therefore solved the set of rges from the top mass scale @xmath83 to the gut scale @xmath84 , taking into account the one - loop threshold corrections at a susy scale ( @xmath85 ) which has been assumed to be about @xmath86 tev . with superparticle masses",
    "not too widely split around @xmath85 , rg running can be performed in a two - step procedure , first with the sm rges from @xmath87 to @xmath85 , where one - loop matching is performed , and then from @xmath85 to @xmath84 using mssm rges .",
    "the additional right - handed neutrino thresholds within the seesaw framework have also been considered but turned out to have no significant effects .    at the matching scale @xmath85",
    ", we have included all relevant @xmath13-enhanced one - loop corrections to the quark and lepton yukawa couplings , which stem from susy qcd contributions ( for all down - type quarks ) , susy ew contributions ( for all down - type quarks and charged leptons ) and from the trilinear soft susy breaking coupling @xmath88 ( for the @xmath43 quark ) .",
    "for this purpose we have also calculated the susy ew corrections to the charged lepton yukawa couplings in the ew unbroken phase . in general",
    "they can not be neglected in a quantitative analysis of the susy threshold effects as we have shown .    using the above described approach , we have analysed which values of quark and charged lepton masses",
    "may be realised at @xmath84 .",
    "since the possible values depend on a large number of susy parameters as well as on the quark mass errors , we have organised our analysis as follows :    * we have first analysed the size of the susy threshold corrections for three example ranges of susy parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath80 ( listed in table [ tab : susypar ] ) . while there is a direct dependence on the gaugino masses and on @xmath45 in the corresponding contributions in equations ( [ eq : expq ] ) to ( [ eq : expl_end ] ) , one can see that the dependence on the squark and slepton masses is somewhat hidden in the function @xmath65 .",
    "we have used the ranges for the threshold corrections to estimate the possible variety of gut scale values of the yukawa couplings due to the unknown susy spectrum semianalytically .",
    "* we have next used best - fit values for the low - energy quark and lepton masses and isolated the effects of @xmath13 and @xmath91 as well as of the signs of @xmath45 and of the gluino mass @xmath26 ( keeping @xmath28 and @xmath30 positive ) . on the one hand",
    "this illustrates the dependence on @xmath13 and @xmath91 anticipated from the leading susy qcd contribution in equation ( [ eq : expq ] ) . on the other hand , comparing the cases @xmath92 , @xmath93 to @xmath94 , @xmath95 ( with sparticle masses fixed at this stage at @xmath86 tev ) demonstrates the importance of the ew contributions to the threshold corrections .",
    "our results are shown as contour plots in figures  [ fig : contour12 ] and [ fig : contour34 ] .",
    "* we have then discussed the effects of @xmath88 , which can provide an important contribution to the correction for the @xmath43 quark yukawa coupling @xmath10 ( but can be neglected for the others ) .",
    "furthermore , varying @xmath85 ( but keeping it still around the tev scale ) did in general not have a significant effect .",
    "similarly , including right - handed neutrino thresholds , which appear in seesaw scenarios for small neutrinos masses , did not significantly affect the gut scale values of the quark and charged lepton yukawa couplings , at least compared to the relevant susy parameters .",
    "* finally we have turned to the numerical discussion of the impact of the sparticle spectrum using the same example ranges of susy parameters as for the semianalytic estimates .",
    "we note that since we have not specified the remaining susy parameters ( which do not enter the formulae for the threshold corrections ) we have not applied various relevant phenomenological constraints on the spectrum ( cf .",
    "discussion in section [ sec : scan ] ) .",
    "the numerical results for our example ranges of susy parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath80 are summarised as scatter plots in figure [ fig : scatter ] for @xmath96 40 and 50 and additionally in table  [ tab : serror ] for @xmath97 .",
    "our final results , with quark errors included , are presented in tables  [ tab : ratfinal ] and [ tab : yukfinal ] .",
    "they provide the resulting possible ranges for quark and charged lepton yukawa couplings at the gut scale in the presence of threshold corrections ( for the example susy parameter ranges @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath80 ) as well as the resulting ranges for several relevant quark and lepton mass ratios .",
    "the tables illustrate that with susy threshold effects ( and quark mass errors ) included , a wide range of gut scale values of down - type quark and charged lepton yukawa couplings could be realised , consistent with the low - energy experimental data on quark and charged lepton masses .",
    "one interesting aspect is that this opens up new possibilities for constructing gut models of fermion masses and mixings .",
    "susy threshold corrections can on the one hand improve consistency with existing postulated gut scale relations such as the gj relations @xmath7 , @xmath8 or third family yukawa unification @xmath14 , but they might also point to new gut scale relations ( cf .",
    "discussion in section [ sec : models ] ) , if low - energy supersymmetry is discovered at the lhc .",
