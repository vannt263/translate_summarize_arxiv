    "type i x - ray bursts are possibly the most frequent thermonuclear explosions in the universe and provide a large amount of observational data that can be used to determine the properties of matter near the surface of a neutron star . to make meaningful inferences about these properties from observational data , however , we must have a proper theoretical understanding of the bursting phenomena @xcite .",
    "the basic xrb paradigm takes place in a mass - transferring , low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) system in which the neutron star s companion has filled its roche lobe and is dumping h- and/or he - rich material onto the surface of the neutron star . depending on the accretion rate and composition ,",
    "there are several burning regimes that will trigger an xrb ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "the general idea is that a column of accreted material  or heavier - element ash from prior stable burning of accreted material  builds up until the temperature sensitivity of the energy generation rate at the base of the layer exceeds that of the local cooling rate and a thin - shell thermal instability forms .",
    "the instability eventually causes a runaway of unstable burning resulting in an outburst .",
    "one - dimensional hydrodynamic studies reproduce many of the observable features of xrbs such as burst energies ( @xmath0 erg ) , rise times ( seconds ) , durations ( @xmath1 s  @xmath2 s of seconds ) and recurrence times ( hours to days ) ( @xcite ; also see @xcite for a review of xrbs ) . by construction , however , one - dimensional models assume that the fuel is burned uniformly over the surface of the star , which is highly unlikely given the large disparity between the thermalization and burning timescales of the accreted material @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "satellite has observed coherent oscillations in the lightcurves of @xmath3 outbursts from lmxb systems ( first by @xcite ; more recently by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the asymptotic evolution of the frequency of such oscillations suggests they are modulated by the neutron star spin frequency @xcite .",
    "oscillations observed during the rising portion of an outburst lightcurve are therefore indicative of a spreading burning front being brought in and out of view by stellar rotation .",
    "additionally , oscillations observed during the decay phase of the burst are thought to be caused by unstable surface modes that may depend critically on the local heating and cooling rates during the burst ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the manner in which the burning front spreads and propagates throughout the accreted atmosphere is not well known , and a proper multidimensional modeling of the conditions in the atmosphere prior to outburst is needed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "prior to the actual outburst , the burning at the base of the ignition column drives convection throughout the overlying layers and determines the state of the material in which the burning front will propagate .",
    "one - dimensional simulations of xrbs usually attempt to parameterize the convective overturn and mixing using astrophysical mixing - length theory @xcite or through various diffusive processes ( see @xcite for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "recent multidimensional simulations of stellar convection ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , however , show a large discrepancy in , for example , the velocity of a typical convective eddy when compared to one - dimensional models in the case of stellar evolution codes that use mixing - length theory .",
    "indeed , there has recently been an effort put forth in the astrophysical community , the so - called convection algorithms based on simulations , or cabs , to derive from multidimensional simulations a more physically motivated prescription for handling convection in one dimension @xcite . to date",
    ", such methods have not propagated into the xrb - simulation community and a proper treatment of convection , without assumptions , requires simulation in multiple dimensions .",
    "multidimensional simulations of any aspect of xrbs , however , have hitherto been rather restrictive .",
    "a burning front can propagate either supersonically as a detonation or subsonically as a deflagration .",
    "full hydrodynamic xrb detonation models in the spirit of @xcite or @xcite require a thick ( @xmath4 m ) accreted helium layer .",
    "such deep layers are only produced by very low accretion rates , which are inconsistent with the majority of rates inferred from observations of xrbs , and therefore the burning front in most xrbs likely propagates as a deflagration .",
    "deflagration models are difficult to compute with standard compressible hydrodynamics codes due to the long integration times required .",
    "one possible solution is to eliminate the effect of acoustic waves in the system , allowing the time step to be controlled by the fluid velocity , rather than the sound speed .",
    "such a method can be derived using low mach number asymptotics ; classic examples of low mach number approaches include the incompressible , anelastic @xcite and boussinesq @xcite approximations . to this end",
    ", @xcite used a simple , shallow - water , 2-layer , incompressible fluid to model the vertical structure of a deflagration front and showed how rotation coupled with convection may play an important role in regulating the spread of the front over the surface of the neutron star .",
    "more recently , @xcite developed and applied a low mach number approximation method to the problem of convective burning at the base of an accreted layer in an xrb system .",
    "their method , however , was first order accurate in space and time and did not allow for the evolution of the hydrostatic base state , a feature that is needed to capture the expansion of the atmosphere in response to heating .",
    "furthermore , lin et al . did not model the surface of the accreted layer , which is vital to understanding bursts that exhibit photospheric radius expansion ( pre bursts ) ; such bursts are crucial in determining the stellar properties of neutron stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in this study we use maestro @xcite , a multidimensional low mach number hydrodynamics algorithm for astrophysical flows , to model the convection leading up to an outburst of a pure @xmath5he  accretor .",
    "maestro is a second - order accurate , conservative method that uses rectangular grid cells .",
    "the algorithm is capable of capturing the expansion of the atmosphere due to large - scale heating , while capturing local compressibility effects due to reactions , thermal diffusion and compositional changes .",
    "a semi - analytic method is used to generate one - dimensional initial models .",
    "these models are then augmented by being evolved in a one - dimensional stellar evolution code ; this evolution allows for the approximation of the convective cooling and leads to a model that is closer to satisfying the thin shell instability condition .",
    "the resulting model is then mapped into maestro and evolved in multiple dimensions .",
    "the main goals of this paper are to explore and describe the challenges of modeling xrbs in multiple dimensions and to better understand the convective phase that precedes the outburst .",
    "the remainder of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : initial models ] , we describe the generation of the initial models and the subsequent mapping into a multidimensional framework . in section [ sec : hydrodynamics algorithm ] , we describe the maestro algorithm , including the addition of two new modules not present in the original algorithm .",
    "specifically , we have added thermal conduction and a `` volume discrepancy '' correction term to the velocity field to ensure that the solution does not diverge from the equation of state . in section [ sec : results ] , we describe the results of our multidimensional simulations .",
    "in particular we discuss the resolution needed to properly resolve the burning layer , the effects of including the thermal diffusion and volume discrepancy correction terms , the expansion of the base state due to heating and finally the nature of the convective behavior and its effect on the atmosphere .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] by summarizing our results and describing our plans to extend the current study to mixed h / he xrb sources .",
    "we begin our calculations by generating a one - dimensional initial model of the accreted layer in hydrostatic ( hse ) and thermal equilibria on the surface of a neutron star .",
    "we assume a plane - parallel geometry  that is , the gravitational acceleration , @xmath6 , is assumed constant throughout the domain , which is justified because the thickness of the accreted layer ( @xmath7 m ) is much less than the radius of the neutron star ( @xmath7 km ) .",
    "we assume a @xmath5he  layer is accreted on top of a @xmath8fe  neutron star with a trace abundance ( @xmath9 ) of @xmath10c .",
    "we choose a pure @xmath5he  accretor both because the corresponding nuclear reaction network , @xmath11 burning , is simple compared to the slow , @xmath12-decay - limited burning processes in bursts involving h , and because ultra - compact xrb sources are possible pure @xmath5he  accretors ( 4u 1820 - 30 , for example ; @xcite ) .",
    "we include the forward and reverse @xmath11 reaction rates as given in @xcite with electron screening contributions from @xcite for the weak regime and from @xcite for the strong regime .",
    "there are several approaches to one - dimensional model generation in the literature . in our approach",
    ", we begin with a semi - analytic initial model and then augment the model to account for convective cooling .",
    "we also discuss proper mapping of the one - dimensional model to our multidimensional framework .",
    "the semi - analytic approach to model generation involves integration of the heat equation and an entropy equation , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the speed of light , @xmath15 the radiation constant , @xmath16 the opacity ( including radiative and conductive contributions ) , @xmath17 the temperature , @xmath18 the outward heat flux and @xmath19 with @xmath20 the column - depth ( see @xcite for details of this method ) .",
    "note that ( [ eq : heat ] ) can give a thermal profile that is superadiabatic  in practice , the thermal gradient is restricted to be @xmath21 where the subscript @xmath22 means along an adiabat .",
    "also note that for simplicity , equation ( [ eq : entropy ] ) neglects any compressional heating contributions from the accretion itself and assumes the accreted material is not burning during the accretion phase  this is a steady - state configuration .",
    "there is , however , an outward heat flux from pycnonuclear reactions deep within the neutron star crust ; we approximate this flux as a constant value throughout the accreted layer , @xmath23 kev per nucleon .",
    "the integration starts at the top of the @xmath5he  atmosphere ( arbitrarily at @xmath24 g @xmath25 ) where a radiative zero solution is assumed , and continues until the thin shell instability condition @xcite , @xmath26 is reached at @xmath27 .",
    "the local cooling rate is typically approximated from ( [ eq : heat ] ) and ( [ eq : entropy ] ) as @xmath28 when ( [ eq : thermal instability ] ) is attained , the composition for @xmath29 is switched to @xmath8fe   and integration of ( [ eq : heat ] ) and ( [ eq : entropy ] ) resumes until a thick enough substrate is formed such that @xmath30 is sufficiently far from the bottom of the computational domain , @xmath31 g @xmath25 in our studies .",
    "the approximation , ( [ eq : approx cooling ] ) , works well in one dimension because the only efficient way the system can cool ( neglecting weak reactions ) is via conduction and radiation , which enter through the opacity .",
    "when more spatial dimensions are added to the system and there is heating from below from nuclear reactions , the fluid is free to overturn and cool via convection .",
    "now we have a situation where the local multidimensional cooling rate , @xmath32 , exceeds the initial approximation and ( [ eq : thermal instability ] ) may no longer be satisfied .",
    "therefore , such a semi - analytic model is no longer close to runaway and to evolve the system in multiple dimensions until ( [ eq : thermal instability ] ) is reached is intractable even with the advantages of a low mach number approximation code .",
    "one way to overcome the difficulties with evolving the model described in the previous section in multiple dimensions is to explicitly include an _ effective _ convective cooling term in the approximation to the local cooling given by equation ( [ eq : approx cooling ] ) .",
    "this _ effective _ convective cooling can be included via mixing - length theory typically found in stellar evolution codes . using the semi - analytic model described above as initial conditions , the one - dimensional stellar evolution code , kepler @xcite ,",
    "was used to construct the remainder of the underlying neutron star with @xmath33 km and @xmath34 ( woosley , 2010 ; private communication ) .",
    "the system is then allowed to evolve in one dimension whereupon nuclear burning heats the base of the layer , and the convection prescription develops a well - mixed and nearly adiabatic region of @xmath10c  ash overlying the @xmath5he  base .",
    "this results in a model that is much closer to satisfying the thermal instability criterion , ( [ eq : thermal instability ] ) , when mapped into multiple dimensions .",
    "the data from kepler are given in a lagrangian ( mass ) coordinate system and we need to convert them to an eulerian ( physical ) coordinate system for use in maestro .",
    "we use a procedure similar to that found in @xcite to ensure our initial model is in hse . given the density , temperature and composition from the kepler evolution , we call the equation of state to get the pressure",
    ". we then discretize the hse equation and solve for the non - uniform eulerian grid spacing corresponding to the lagrangian grid points , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the radial coordinate , @xmath37 the pressure and @xmath38 the density .",
    "we set @xmath39 to complete the description of the grid .",
    "the transition from the pure @xmath8fe  neutron star ( at @xmath40 ) to the @xmath5he  atmosphere ( at @xmath41 ) is a step function as a result of the initial lagrangian data .",
    "such sharp transitions can be a source of numerical noise and oscillations as the solution evolves on an eulerian grid . to minimize the numerical noise",
    ", we smooth the interface by adding @xmath42 uniformly distributed coordinate points between @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the temperature at these new points is linearly interpolated between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "then @xmath45 and @xmath46 at the new points are filled with a @xmath47 profile : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 is a parameter to set the smoothness .",
    "@xmath53 is then found from the constraint @xmath54 , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are found by using an iterative newton - raphson technique with the equation of state and ( [ eq : hse ] ) at these new points .",
    "this smoothed model is then linearly interpolated onto a completely uniform grid , with @xmath55 , and is again put into hse using ( [ eq : hse ] ) and the equation of state .",
    "values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 were used to smooth the models presented in this work .",
    "figure [ fig : stan model ] shows the result of this procedure for two models that were evolved in kepler until the base of the @xmath5he  atmosphere had reached a temperature of @xmath58 k ( solid line , hereafter referred to as the cold  model ) and @xmath59 k ( dotted line , hereafter referred to as the hot  model ) .",
    "the density at the base of the @xmath5he  layer for the cold  model is @xmath60 g @xmath61 and is @xmath62 g @xmath61 for the hot  model . for comparison , the initial model of @xcite",
    "had a base temperature and density of @xmath63 k and @xmath64",
    "g @xmath61 , respectively . the cold  model has a peak in @xmath10c  production around @xmath65 cm ( i.e. , the base of the @xmath5he  layer in both models ) that appears smoothed in the more evolved hot  model . both models , however , have an extended region of well - mixed @xmath10c  that extends to @xmath66 cm ( @xmath67 cm ) for the cold  ( hot ) model .",
    "these initial models contain no multidimensional velocity information from the kepler simulations .",
    "we therefore make no assumptions about the nature of the convection when the models are mapped into multiple dimensions in maestro .",
    "for our multidimensional simulations , we use the low mach number stellar hydrodynamics algorithm , maestro .",
    "this code is appropriate for flows in the low mach number regime , where the characteristic fluid velocity is small compared to the speed of sound .",
    "note that the algorithm does not enforce that the mach number remain small , but rather is only valid for such flows .",
    "a series of papers ( see @xcite  henceforth paper i , @xcite  henceforth paper ii , @xcite  henceforth paper iii , and @xcite  henceforth paper iv ) describe the derivation of the low mach number equation set , its algorithmic implementation , and the initial application to convection in a white dwarf preceding a type ia supernova .",
    "we use the most recent version of the algorithm , which includes local adaptive mesh refinement , as given in @xcite  henceforth paper v.    one key advantage of using a low mach number approach is the increase of allowable time step size , which enables long - time integration .",
    "standard compressible hydrodynamics codes for astrophysical applications such as castro @xcite or flash @xcite evolve a fully compressible equation set , i.e. , the euler equations , which allows for the formation and propagation of shocks . for low speed convective motion in our pre - burst convection studies , we do not need to explicitly follow the propagation of sound waves .",
    "our low mach number equation set does not contain acoustic waves , and therefore maestro is able to take time steps constrained by the maximum fluid velocity , rather than the maximum sound speed . as an example , if the maximum mach number of the flow is @xmath68 , we will obtain a factor of @xmath69 increase in time step size compared to a standard compressible approach .",
    "another advantage of a low mach number method is that the overall hse of the state can be guaranteed by the inclusion of a base state in hse in the low mach number equation set .",
    "this removes the difficulties of maintaining hse commonly found in compressible hydrodynamics codes .",
    "maestro solves a system of advection - reaction - diffusion equations with the equation of state formulated as an elliptic constraint on the velocity .",
    "maestro uses a higher - order godunov method to discretize the advective terms , strang - splitting to couple the reaction terms to the advective terms , and a semi - implicit treatment of the diffusion terms .",
    "the diffusion term and the divergence constraint are formulated as linear systems which are solved iteratively using multigrid .",
    "the evolution of the one - dimensional base state density is also computed .",
    "the base state density represents the average state of the atmosphere , and is coupled to the base state pressure via hse .",
    "the base state density has its own evolution equation that computes the expansion of the atmosphere due to heating and is discretized using a higher - order godunov method .",
    "we note that maestro is second - order accurate in space and time .",
    "we now provide additional details of the low mach number equation set and numerical implementation .",
    "the interested reader is referred to papers i - v for full details .",
    "we use a two - dimensional cartesian formulation with @xmath70 the horizontal coordinate and @xmath36 the radial coordinate .",
    "the low mach number equation set is : @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the velocity , specific enthalpy , and thermal conductivity , respectively .",
    "the species are represented by their mass fractions , @xmath75 , along with their associated production rates , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the nuclear energy generation rate per unit mass . using low mach number asymptotics",
    "( see paper i ) the total pressure , @xmath78 , is decomposed into a base state pressure , @xmath79 , and a perturbational , or dynamic , pressure , @xmath80 , such that @xmath81 .",
    "the base state density , @xmath82 , is in hse with the base state pressure such that @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the unit vector in the outward radial direction .",
    "thermal conduction was not present in paper v , so we have developed a semi - implicit discretization for this term .",
    "we include full algorithmic implementation details in appendix [ sec : thermal diffusion ] and a verification test problem in appendix [ sec : diffusion solver test ] .",
    "mathematically , this system must still be closed by the equation of state , which is expressed as a divergence constraint on the velocity field ( see paper iii ) , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a density - like variable , @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the average of @xmath89 where the subscript @xmath22 means the derivative is taken at constant entropy .",
    "we will use an overline notation to represent the average of a quantity , which computationally is the arithmetic average of all grid cells at a particular radius .",
    "the expansion term , @xmath90 , in ( [ eq : divergence constraint in theory ] ) accounts for local compressibility effects resulting from nuclear burning , compositional changes , and thermal conduction : @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 with @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "another addition to the maestro algorithm is the use of a `` volume discrepancy '' correction .",
    "because ( [ eq : divergence constraint in theory ] ) is a linearization of the nonlinear constraint imposed by the equation of state , the thermodynamic pressure , @xmath98 , may drift from the base state pressure , @xmath99 , @xcite . to correct for this drift , ( [ eq : divergence constraint in theory ] ) is augmented with a term that drives the thermodynamic pressure back to the that of the base state : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the volume discrepancy correction factor and @xmath102 . in section [ sec : effects of the volume discrepancy term ] , we explore the effectiveness of this term at keeping the overall solution in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "to track the evolution of the base state density , we first define the expansion velocity as the average outward velocity : @xmath103 as described in paper v , we compute @xmath104 by integrating a one - dimensional divergence constraint , found by taking the average of equation ( [ eq : divergence constraint in practice ] ) : @xmath105 the evolution equation for the base state density can be found by considering the average of the continuity equation : @xmath106 which we discretize with a higher - order godunov method .",
    "we use special care in dealing with the low density region of our simulation .",
    "the density spans many orders of magnitude , and due to conservation of momentum we may generate large velocities in the upper atmosphere that do not affect the solution in the higher - density region .",
    "unfortunately , these large velocities reduce the efficiency of our method by reducing the time step size .",
    "the first technique we use to address this problem is the use of a cutoff density , @xmath107 , which is the value we hold the density to outside the star .",
    "the second technique we use is the use of an anelastic cutoff density , @xmath108 , below which we determine @xmath86 by keeping the ratio @xmath109 constant in the divergence constraint in order to minimize spurious wave generation .",
    "full implementation details for the cutoff densities are described in appendix a.5 of paper v. in this paper , we use @xmath110 .    the third technique adopted for the low density region is sponging ( or damping ) , which is used to reduce gravity waves at the surface of the star .",
    "this technique is commonly used in the atmospheric modeling community as lateral boundary conditions of limited area simulations ( see , for example , @xcite ) as well as upper boundary conditions to reduce wave reflection off of sharp gradients in the atmospheric structure ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we have previously utilized the sponging technique in the study of convection in the cores of white dwarfs ( paper iv ) .",
    "full details for the sponge implementation in ` maestro ` can be found in papers iii and iv , but in summary , we add a forcing term to the velocity , which effectively damps the velocity so that @xmath111 .",
    "we use the following formulation for the sponge : @xmath112      + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + f_{\\rm damp , min}\\right ) , & r_{\\rm sp } < r \\le r_{\\rm tp } , \\\\",

    "figure [ fig : sponge ] shows the initial profile of the sponge for the cold  model .",
    "note that as the system evolves it is free to expand thus changing the location of the density cutoffs and consequently the location and extent of the sponge .",
    "the inclusion of a sponge layer does not strictly conserve kinetic energy in the sponged region .",
    "we note , however , that the material above the surface of the star is at relatively low density compared to the material in the convective region , and therefore the total amount of energy non - conservation is small . furthermore , as shown in figure 4 of paper iii , the inclusion of a sponge layer in the low density region of a simulation does not affect the dynamics of the flow in the convective region of interest .",
    "we describe below the results of mapping the kepler - supplemented models into maestro in two dimensions , ( @xmath118 ) , and the system s subsequent evolution .",
    "section [ sec : resolution requirements ] describes the resolution requirements needed to properly resolve the burning layer . in section [ sec : effects of thermal diffusion ] we show how the inclusion of thermal diffusion affects the nuclear burning layer and its location .",
    "we show in section [ sec : expansion due to heating ] how utilizing a time - dependent base state allows us to capture the expansion of the atmosphere due to heating .",
    "section [ sec : effects of the volume discrepancy term ] shows how including a volume discrepancy correction keeps the base state thermally consistent with the equation of state .",
    "finally we discuss the extent and evolution of the convective region in section [ sec : convection ] .",
    "to map the one - dimensional model into maestro , we copy laterally across the domain such that @xmath119 for each variable @xmath120 in the model . in the following analysis , the subscript `` max ''",
    "refers to the maximum value of a quantity in the computational domain at a given time step . in two dimensions",
    ", we define the average as a function of radius,@xmath121 , of a quantity @xmath120 by @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 is the total number of grid zones in the lateral , @xmath70 , direction at height @xmath125 at time @xmath126 .",
    "we use the general equation of state of @xcite , which includes contributions from electrons , ions , and radiation .",
    "we calculate opacities using frank timmes publicly available conductivity routine , which includes contributions from radiation and electron conduction processes as explained in @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the method for calculating opacities used in maestro is not the same as what is used the kepler code ; it is likely , however , that the different methods give opacities that agree to within a factor of @xmath127 ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the boundary conditions for all simulations are periodic in the @xmath70-direction to mimic a laterally extended convection region .",
    "the upper @xmath36 boundary is outflow to allow for free expansion of the atmosphere .",
    "the lower @xmath36 boundary of dense neutron star material is set to a wall with no normal flow . to solve the thermal diffusion contribution at the upper and lower boundaries we impose the neumann condition @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the outward facing normal vector ; the enthalpy boundary conditions are periodic in the lateral directions .",
    "we note that the upper and lower domain boundaries are sufficiently far from the burning layer so that they do not affect the dynamics of the convection .",
    "an advective cfl number of @xmath130 was used in all of our simulations .",
    "as previously mentioned , we do not obtain any multidimensional velocity information from the kepler models ; our system is initially static . for convection to begin , the symmetry of the system must , therefore , be broken .",
    "this can be accomplished either by placing a small perturbation at the base of the @xmath5he  layer or by allowing numerical noise from the multigrid solver to seed the convective cells . for the simulations presented here , neither approach is advantageous over the other , both giving quantitatively similar steady - state convective",
    "flow fields ; we utilize both approaches in our studies and when perturbing we place a small ( @xmath131 ) gaussian temperature perturbation laterally centered at height @xmath132 cm to break the initial symmetry of the problem .      to date",
    ", the only other paper in the literature regarding multidimensional simulations of xrbs as deflagrations @xcite used a finest resolution of @xmath133 cm zone@xmath134 .",
    "they presented multidimensional results at @xmath133 , @xmath135 , and @xmath1 cm zone@xmath134 resolutions and remarked that there is a `` tendency toward convergence with increasing resolution '' based on the time to reach the peak energy generation rate .",
    "it is important to note that our initial models are different from those of @xcite .",
    "in particular , their models only considered two species  the accreted layer was pure @xmath5he  and the underlying neutron star was composed entirely of @xmath10c .",
    "this caused their models to have a smaller jump in mean molecular weight across the neutron star / accreted layer boundary compared to our models .",
    "furthermore , the initial conditions for their multidimensional studies were from the results of a one - dimensional diffusional - thermal code that evolved the system through several bursts",
    ". these differences from our method of initial model generation give the @xcite models an extended ( @xmath4 cm ) thermal peak compared to our narrow ( @xmath7 cm ) peak ( compare our figure [ fig : stan model ] to their figure 2 ) .",
    "the burning layer at the base of the accreted material is very thin ; high resolution is required to properly model this region .",
    "the peak of the thermal profile for the hot  model is broader than the corresponding peak in the cold  model .",
    "consequently , the burning layer in the hot  model is thicker than that of the cold  model  we therefore focus our study of resolution requirements on the more restrictive of the two , the cold  model .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : enuc at 1ms ] shows the @xmath136 profile at @xmath137 ms for simulations of the cold  model using the same resolutions as in the @xcite study . even at this early time there is a @xmath138% spread in the peak value of @xmath136 for these resolutions .",
    "the bottom panel shows the same profile but at several higher resolutions .",
    "the peak value of @xmath136 for the @xmath139 cm zone@xmath134 simulation is comparable to the peak values in the top panel , but we only see numerical convergence of the peak value as we go to higher spatial resolution . in addition , the shape of the profile near peak converges with increasing resolution ; the @xmath140 and @xmath141 cm zone@xmath134 resolution simulations look qualitatively similar .",
    "we therefore claim that the burning layer is not properly resolved in our models unless a resolution of @xmath141 cm zone@xmath134 is used .",

    "we can , however , investigate the effects of thermal diffusion on the stable burning that occurs in the burning layer .",

    "it should be noted that the typical standard deviation in the location of @xmath144 for the case without diffusion is of order @xmath142 cm ; this suggests that perhaps thermal diffusion plays a role in regulating the location of maximum nuclear burning , but further evolution is needed to make statistically significant claims .",
    "having a dynamical base state allows us to capture the large - scale expansion of the atmosphere due to heating from nuclear reactions .",
    "this differs from the work by @xcite , which had a time - independent base state and did not model the top of the accreted atmosphere due to numerical complications with their algorithm .",

    "as the system expands , the @xmath99 profile changes , which can affect the dynamics in the convective region . additionally , as the atmosphere expands , the burning layer becomes less degenerate , which may be important for the nucleosynthesis during the outburst .",
    "furthermore , a proper modeling of this expansion during the peak of a pre burst model may help pinpoint the location of the photosphere with respect to the stellar radius at touchdown , a quantity that plays an important role in using xrbs to measure the mass and radius of the underlying neutron star ( * ? ? ? * for example ) .",

    ", the oscillatory behavior in the drift is due to the fact that the system may slightly over - correct the thermodynamic pressure in a given time step and then recover in the next step . a larger value of @xmath101 causes a stronger driving of the drift , which tends to be more oscillatory .",
    "in addition , a larger value of @xmath101 appears to be correlated with larger spikes in the drift .",

    "the stripes in the initial conditions , figure [ subfig : ad excess 0 ] , are due to small interpolation errors from mapping the initial data onto the two - dimensional grid .",
    "the initial adjustment of the system seen in figure [ subfig : ad excess 0.4 ] causes a mixing of stable ( blue ) and unstable ( red ) fluid elements .",
    "this transient adjustment phase occurs for two reasons : 1 ) the initial conditions were based on a parameterization of convection in one dimension and the system now needs to adjust to a two - dimensional convective zone , and 2 ) the initial perturbation does not have an established convection zone and the system needs a short amount of time to build up a flow pattern associated with the perturbation .",
    "this results in mixing that produces a region that is marginally convective ( @xmath183 ; white ) with localized pockets of stable and unstable fluid elements as seen in figure [ subfig : ad excess 0.8 ] . at later times",
    ", these pockets further localize into vortices whose circulation gives rise to roughly circular regions of nonzero adiabatic excess  with one hemisphere that is stable and the other which is unstable  that are advected with the flow before dispersing into the ambient medium on subconvective timescales , @xmath184 s. the vortices are always associated with an adiabatic excess pattern that has an unstable ( red ) bottom and a stable ( blue ) top unless two vortices are merging and interacting , in which case the stability distribution becomes skewed .",
    "figure [ fig : late adiabatic excess evolution ] shows @xmath165 for the same simulation as in figure [ fig : early adiabatic excess evolution ] but at later times .",
    "the boxes in these plots outline a single long - lived vortex that forms around @xmath185 ms , figure [ subfig : ad excess 18.5 ] , and lasts throughout the remainder of the simulation .",
    "formation of this vortex is correlated with the formation of stronger filamentary structures , which are most clear in figures [ subfig : ad excess 25 ] , [ subfig : ad excess 26 ] and [ subfig : ad excess 28 ] .",
    "these filaments appear to wrap around the solitary vortex and restrict the main formation of smaller vortices to the lower boundary of the convective region .",
    "another way to quantify the convective region is to look at the ratio @xmath186 .",
    "from ( [ eq : adiabatic excess ] ) we see that the system is unstable to convection under the schwarzschild criterion when @xmath187 .",
    "the schwarzschild criterion , however , does not consider the effects of composition gradients that may help stabilize the material against convection ; for this we need to consider the ledoux criterion for instability @xmath188 where the ledoux thermal gradient is ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath189 and the second term above is evaluated via finite differences of the composition and pressure profiles .",
    "as with the schwarzschild criterion , one can look at the ratio @xmath190 , which is greater than unity if the material is unstable to ledoux convection .",
    "figure [ subfig : example convective profiles ] shows the above ratios for the average thermal gradients for the initial configuration ( left ) and after the system has evolved for @xmath191 ms ( right ) ; the black line is for the case of schwarzschild criterion convection , while the red line is for ledoux convection .",
    "the dashed horizontal line marks the boundary for stability against convection .",
    "where the curves lie above this line , the configuration is unstable ; when convection is efficient , the curves should lie very near the horizontal line . for both the initial condition and at late times , the schwarzschild curve and the ledoux curve are well matched except near the edges of the convective region where composition gradients cause the two curves to deviate slightly .",
    "this is most noticeable in the initial configuration at the upper boundary where there is a sharp jump in composition , which was not smoothed ( see figure [ fig : stan model ] ) . of interest in the plot at @xmath191",
    "ms is the feature at @xmath192 cm , which has an unstable bottom and a stable top ; this is consistent with the vortices in figures [ fig : early adiabatic excess evolution ] and [ fig : late adiabatic excess evolution ] , which had red bottoms and blue tops .",
    "we define the edge of the convective region to be where @xmath186 , @xmath193 .",
    "this particular value of @xmath194 was chosen to be sufficiently small enough to rule out false positives from strong pockets of stability from , for example , vortices within the convective region , but also large enough to rule out any fluctuations at the boundaries due to overshoot .",
    "figure [ subfig : extents of convection ] shows in grey the extent of the convective region as a function of time with respect to the full domain for both the schwarzschild ( left ) and ledoux ( right ) instability criteria . the horizontal dashed lines mark the initial location of the lower and upper boundaries .",
    "the overall expansion of the upper boundary for the schwarzschild ( ledoux ) criterion is @xmath195 ( @xmath196 ) cm in @xmath197 ms of evolution ; the lower boundary expands downward by @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) cm in the same time . at late times",
    ", the upper boundary of the convective region has a much smoother composition transition than the lower boundary , therefore , the schwarzschild and ledoux criteria are much better matched at the upper boundary than the lower .",
    "nevertheless , both the ledoux and schwarzschild criteria yield similar results when used to determine the extent of the convective region . in terms of column - depth ,",
    "the convective zone after @xmath197 ms of evolution spans the region @xmath200 g",
    "@xmath201 g @xmath25 for both instability criteria .    for comparison , figures [ fig : c12 early ] and [ fig : c12 late ] show the @xmath10c  mass fraction with velocity vectors for the same simulation and at the same times as in figures [ fig : early adiabatic excess evolution ] and [ fig : late adiabatic excess evolution ] , respectively .",
    "these figures clearly show the association of vortices with the circular regions of nonzero adiabatic excess seen in figures [ fig : early adiabatic excess evolution ] and [ fig : late adiabatic excess evolution ] .",
    "the initial adjustment of the system causes mixing that smooths the slight over - abundance of @xmath10c  at the base of the accreted layer present in the initial model ( see figure [ fig : stan model ] ) . at late times",
    ", the convective region is very well - mixed , and the @xmath10c  mass fraction is nearly laterally homogeneous .",
    "furthermore , the circulation pattern associated with the long - lived vortex outlined in figure [ fig : late adiabatic excess evolution ] has grown to a large fraction of the convective zone and is self - interacting because of the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the tendency of the system to form a single dominant vortex from smaller vortices is a feature of two - dimensional simulations . in three dimensions , the turbulent energy cascade moves from large to small scales ;",
    "large vortical structures break down into smaller structures that are eventually dissipated by viscous effects . in two dimensions ,",
    "as is the case here , the turbulent energy cascade is reversed ",
    "small vortical structures merge together to form a single dominant vortex .",
    "the circulation is counter - clockwise for the large , long - lived vortex ; this causes a region with positive @xmath70-velocity below and a region of negative @xmath70-velocity above the vortex center .",
    "the positive @xmath70-velocity region extends all the way to the lower convective boundary where it causes shearing of the @xmath5he/@xmath10c - rich region with the underlying @xmath8fe  region .",
    "consequently , figure [ fig : iron enrichment ] shows that some of the underlying @xmath8fe  neutron star material is churned up into the convective region where it is mixed with the rest of the convective material .",
    "the left panel shows average @xmath8fe  mass fraction profiles starting with the initial model abundance ( thick solid line ) through @xmath202 ms ( thick dashed line ) ; the intermediate thin solid lines show profiles at the times used in figures [ fig : early adiabatic excess evolution ] and [ fig : late adiabatic excess evolution ] .",
    "by @xmath203 ms , the @xmath8fe  is fairly well - mixed in the convective region .",
    "the right panel shows the total mass of @xmath8fe  in the region defined by the initial convective zone . the greatest growth in the total mass occurs , as expected , in the initial adjustment ( @xmath204 ms ) and then flattens until large enough structures form such that there is sufficient shearing occurring at the base of the convective boundary .",
    "there is only a slight increase in the growth rate for the @xmath8fe  mass around @xmath185 ms where the long - lived vortex first appears .",
    "this is due to the fact , mentioned above , that as the system evolves it goes from many small vortices to a few large , dominant vortices .",
    "it is only when the circulation pattern of a particular vortex is large enough to strongly interact with the lower convection boundary that we get the shearing and enrichment of the convective region ; this occurs around @xmath205 ms .",
    "the addition of @xmath8fe  to the convective region has a small but noticeable effect on the conductivity ; for example , a displacement of @xmath206 @xmath5he  for @xmath8fe  near the base of the accreted layer , with all other things being constant , gives a @xmath207 decrease in conductivity .",
    "this could play an important role in adjusting the flame speed once ignited .",
    "figure [ fig : long enucdot ] shows the evolution of the maximum value of @xmath77 throughout the duration of the cold  model simulation .",
    "the inset plot shows the early adjustment phase mentioned above .",
    "the initial jump in @xmath77 is due to the fact that there is no well established flow field that can efficiently advect away the energy released from reactions .",
    "once the convective zone is well established , the energy generation rate relaxes before making its steady climb .",
    "we note that we have not yet achieved runaway  the rise in energy generation rate is still linear .",
    "this climb is temporarily interrupted by a couple of spikes similar to those seen in figure [ fig : deltap spike closeup ] when fresh fuel is advected to a relatively hot region and burned quickly . although well organized at later times , the convective fluid flow is slow with respect to the sound speed .",
    "figure [ fig : mach number ] shows the maximum mach number in the computational domain as a function of time ; this value never exceeds @xmath208 in our simulation .",
    "the average value of the mach number in the convective region rarely exceeds @xmath209 during our @xmath197 ms simulation .",
    "we have described some of the challenges and important concepts to keep in mind when performing multidimensional simulations of xrbs .",
    "the major results can be summarized as follows :    * to get a system that is much closer to thermal instability in multiple dimensions , the semi - analytic one - dimensional models should augment the local cooling rate estimate , ( [ eq : approx cooling ] ) , to include cooling due to convection . * properly resolving the burning layer using the initial models considered here requires a spatial resolution of @xmath141 cm zone@xmath134 , which is an order of magnitude higher than what has been presented in the literature for multidimensional models @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that our initial models differ in the underlying neutron star s composition  their @xmath10c  opposed to our @xmath8fe  and their models were evolved in one dimension through several bursts before being mapped into multiple dimensions .",
    "* under - resolving the burning layer leads to dramatic convective undershoot and the burning tends to die out .",
    "* at the early times simulated here , the inclusion of thermal diffusion has little effect on the maximum energy generation rate , but does perhaps affect the depth at which this maximum occurs . * the maestro algorithm we use allows us to capture the expansion of the atmosphere due to heating , which will be important in the modeling of pre burst sources . *",
    "the average thermal gradient in the convective region is nearly adiabatic but there are localized pockets and filamentary structures that are either super- or sub - adiabatic . *",
    "the strong convection interacts with and churns up the underlying neutron star material , which slightly alters the conductivity of the convective region .",
    "the initial selection of a value to use for the volume discrepancy term in our simulations was based on experience with other applications . as we showed in section",
    "[ sec : effects of the volume discrepancy term ] , the value used for the long duration simulation in this paper , @xmath160 , may not the optimal choice for the xrb problem .",
    "further investigation is required to determine which factors affect the appropriate value of @xmath101 , and to determine if the spikes in the drift of the thermodynamic pressure from the base state pressure are simply numerical artifacts of a poor choice of @xmath101 .",
    "the width of the computational domain used in our simulations is adequate for the early evolution of the system ; the size of any individual convective cell is initially small with respect to the width of the domain . as the system evolves and the convection becomes more established , the cells grow in size .",
    "the nature of vorticity in two dimensions is such that the smaller vortices merge to form a single vortex . in our simulations",
    "the cells grow to become a significant fraction of the domain width and the flow becomes dominated by a single vortex that interacts with itself through the periodic boundary conditions . by selecting a wider computational grid",
    ", we could delay the formation of a single , dominant vortex .",
    "ideally the computational domain should be several pressure scale - heights wide so that we should form multiples of these convective cells that dominate the flow for an extended period of time before merging into a single vortex .",
    "given our strict resolution requirements , such a setup was computationally infeasible .",
    "we plan to further investigate some of the topics mentioned above in future work while studying mixed h / he bursts . in such bursts",
    "the majority of the energy release comes from burning hydrogen ; the nuclear reaction rates involved in such burning are less temperature sensitive than the @xmath146-@xmath210 rate used in the current paper",
    ". this may allow for a relaxed resolution requirement for properly resolving the burning layer because the energy generation rate profile should not be as sharply peaked as we have seen in our studies .",
    "this would allow for longer time evolution , which may allow us to say something about whether or not the convective zone extends all the way to the photosphere near outburst .",
    "we will also be able to simulate larger domains where we could address the effects of domain size on the long - term evolution of the convective region and its @xmath8fe  enrichment .",
    "furthermore , we will begin investigating the effects of unprecedented three - dimensional simulations of the convection that precedes the outburst in an xrb and compare its properties to our two - dimensional studies .",
    "all of these simulations will rely heavily on maestro s new amr capability to reduce computational cost for long - term evolution .",
    "we will also investigate the effects of using different methods of calculating opacities as well as updated reaction rates , such as the @xmath146-@xmath210 rate of @xcite .",
    "we thank frank timmes for making his conductivity and equation of state routines publicly available and ed brown for useful discussions regarding the possibility of relaxed resolution requirements for h burning .",
