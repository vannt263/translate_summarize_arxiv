    "the heavy - flavor world provides us an opportunity to get insight into the fundamental physics .",
    "the most intriguing problem at the present stage of the theoretical studies on hadron properties and the processes of relatively low energies is lack of solid knowledge on non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the non - perturbative qcd effects which govern the hadronic transition matrix elements , are entangled with the hard subprocesses .    for the processes where some heavy flavors ( b and/or c ) are involved , by the heavy quark effective theory(hqet ) @xcite ,",
    "the short and long - distance qcd effects are separated in a systematic way .",
    "beneke et al.@xcite demonstrated how to correctly apply the factorization procedure to the processes where heavy mesons transit into light ones .    on other side , there are still some unsolved problems in the heavy flavor physics . a protrudent problem is the lifetime of @xmath3 .",
    "the present data for the ratios are @xcite @xmath4    in the traditional spectator scenario , if there are no strong decay channels the weak decays of b - hadrons as well as their lifetimes are fully determined by the weak decays of b - quark , thus the above ratios must be very close to unity . for d - meson , the lifetime of @xmath5 is almost 2.55 times larger than that of @xmath6 .",
    "this difference is perfectly explained in the qcd framework by many authors @xcite , where the non - spectator effects play a crucial role as the pauli - interference(pi ) strongly suppresses the total width of @xmath5 compared to @xmath6 , but the effects are not so obvious for @xmath7 and @xmath8 due to the @xmath9 suppression .",
    "we would think that the lifetimes of @xmath5 , @xmath10 and @xmath7 , @xmath11 are well understood , but for the @xmath12 so far there is not a satisfactory answer to the puzzle yet , it is also worth noticing that this problem is even more serious in the @xmath13 lifetime which we will discuss in our coming work .    as one attempts to explain the puzzle of the @xmath0 lifetime , it is natural to consider the non - spectator contributions . even though the study of the lifetime difference of @xmath7 and @xmath8 indicates that the non - spectator contribution can only result in a small effect for b - meson cases because of the @xmath9 suppression",
    ", it still is necessary to investigate how large such effects can be in the b - baryon case .",
    "namely before one can claim a new physics or mechanism which result in the difference , he has to thoroughly explore possible explanations in the standard qcd framework .    to calculate the lifetime ,",
    "one only needs to deal with the inclusive processes which are relatively simple compared to the exclusive processes , therefore the results are more reliable .",
    "in this work we consider the contributions from the non - spectator effects to the lifetime of @xmath0 . at the quark level",
    ", the foundation is the weak effective lagrangian @xcite .",
    "we not only consider the w - exchange(we ) diagrams and the pauli interference(pi ) diagrams it is only a manifestation of such mechanisms.]where only two quarks take part in the reaction with the other one being a spectator , but also account for the corresponding diagram where all the three valence quarks are involved .",
    "the last mechanism does not exist in the meson case , and seems to result in a difference between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "moreover we also consider the diquark structure where the two light quarks constitute a boson - like diquark of color anti - triplet and it participates in the reaction of we or pi as a whole subject .",
    "then we compare the results obtained in the three - valence - quark picture and the heavy - quark - light - diquark picture .",
    "it could also be a test of the supposed diquark structure of baryons .",
    "the most difficult task is to evaluate the hadronic transition matrix elements which are fully governed by the non - perturbative qcd .",
    "even though we are able to separate the long - distance effects from the short distance subprocess , we still can not evaluate the hadronic matrix elements in a well - established way , but need to carry out a model - dependent calculation . in this work",
    "we adopt the simplest non - relativistic harmonic oscillator model @xcite for the hadron wavefunctions . to obtain the concerned parameters in the model",
    ", we first evaluate the semi - leptonic decays of @xmath16 and @xmath17 which are not contaminated by the final state interactions .",
    "our results are comparable with the works on this aspect in the literatures @xcite and a recent work by chakraverty et al @xcite .",
    "then with the parameters , we calculate the lifetimes of b - mesons and @xmath0 .",
    "to evaluate the ratios @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we calculate the non - spectator contributions to the lifetimes of @xmath8 and @xmath7 in the same model , namely we achieve the wavefunctions of @xmath8 and @xmath7 in the two - body harmonic oscillator model . evaluating the hadronic matrix elements of @xmath20 which appears in the semi - leptonic decay rate of b - mesons , and",
    "then by fitting the data , we gain the model parameters .",
    "we hope that since we evaluate lifetimes of both @xmath3 and b - meson in the same model , the model - dependence of the theoretically evaluated ratios can be partly cancelled , and the results would make more sense .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction we briefly introduce the non - relativistic harmonic oscillator model for @xmath3 in the picture with three valence quarks and as well as that with one heavy quark and one light diquark , then we discuss b - mesons in the same model . in section 3",
    ", we calculate the semi - leptonic decays of b - mesons and @xmath3 where we also use the two pictures of 3-quark and quark - diquark structures respectively . in sect.4",
    ", we use the model to evaluate the lifetimes of b - mesons and @xmath3 , then in sect.5 , we present our numerical results . the last section is devoted to our conclusion and discussion . +",

    "since the measured @xmath199 which is the input parameter for our model , has a relatively large tolerance range , the model parameters can accordingly take various values , here we adopt four typical values @xmath200 , @xmath199 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 , as input . @xmath199 and @xmath203 are the central value and standard deviation of the measured decay rate@xcite . +    @xmath204    table 2 : these four sets of parameters which are obtained by fitting data of semi - leptonic decay @xmath205 and corresponding to ( a ) ( @xmath200 ) , ( b ) @xmath199 , ( c ) ( @xmath201 ) and ( d ) ( @xmath202 ) respectively .    with these parameters",
    "we can numerically calculate the lifetime of @xmath0 similarly to what we have done for @xmath11 and @xmath7 .",
    "the results are shown in table 3 .",
    "+ @xmath206    table 3 : the lifetime of @xmath3 evaluated in our model with different sets of the parameters obtained by fitting data of the semi - leptonic decays , and @xmath207 .",
    "+ the theoretical results indicate that @xmath208 in the 3-valence quark model and @xmath209 in the diquark model while the measured value of the ratio is 0.79 .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) is definitely responsible for the weak transition and the lifetimes of b - mesons , as well as @xmath3 because they do not have strong decay channels . by the common understanding ,",
    "such inclusive decay modes are dominated by the spectator mechanism , namely the decay rate is almost fully determined by the decays of the heavy flavor in the hadron .",
    "however , some puzzles in b - physics emerge as indicated by many authors @xcite , such as the lifetime of @xmath3 , charm number missing in b decays etc . among them",
    "the lifetime of @xmath3 raises the most challenging problem .",
    "bigi et al . discussed the lifetime difference of @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite , they showed that the non - spectator effects play a crucial role to the lifetimes .",
    "in fact , the pauli interference(pi ) mechanism greatly suppresses the decay rate of @xmath5 compared to @xmath6 , and qcd can almost perfectly explain why @xmath210 , but @xmath211 .",
    "therefore it is natural to consider to take into account the non - spectator effects for evaluating the lifetime of @xmath3 .",
    "even though as bigi et al",
    ". indicated , such effects are not so important for b - physics , one may still think that the contributions may be not negligible , because the baryon structure is different from that of mesons , at least there are two light valence quarks and each of them can join the b - quark to make a non - spectator contribution .",
    "moreover , there is a diagram where three valence quarks(b u d ) participate in the reaction ( see fig1(c ) ) , and it does not appear for the meson case . unfortunately our numerical results indicate that this contribution is too small to result in any substantial change to the lifetime of @xmath3 .",
    "the derivation at quark level is standard , the main difficult part comes from the evaluation of the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "we employ the simplest non - relativistic harmonic oscillator model which has been proved to be successful in phenomenology , but definitely is not accurate .",
    "we determine the concerned parameters by fitting the data of semi - leptonic decays and then use them to evaluate the lifetimes . in the process we can reduce the errors and uncertainties in the model - dependent calculation .",
    "then we repeat the procedure with the same model to deal with the b mesons , thus when we compute the ratios of @xmath212 and @xmath18 , the model - dependence is further reduced .    for @xmath3 , we employ two pictures , the three - valence - quark picture and one - heavy - quark - one - light - diquark picture to evaluate the lifetime of @xmath3 , the result obtained in the two pictures are qualitatively consistent .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the non - spectator effects can only result in about at most @xmath213 reduction of the lifetime of @xmath3 whereas the experimental data demand a @xmath214 reduction .",
    "therefore we can claim that the non - spectator contribution is sizable and can not be neglected , taking into account the effects can remarkably alleviate the discrepancy which was not improved by just changing the matrix element parameters @xcite . however , on the other side , the discrepancy still stands and demands a more satisfactory explanation .",
    "because the large fraction of @xmath214 deviation in the ratios can not be compensated by only the non - spectator effects , there must be some unknown mechanisms which induce the difference between baryon and meson .",
    "for example , the proposed three - body force in baryons @xcite might lead to a dramatic difference between baryon and meson , all these mechanisms are worth careful studies and may provide us with better understanding of the hadron structure and fundamental interactions .    as the verbal work of the paper is near completion",
    ", we notice gabbiani et al s work@xcite , they also evaluate the non - spectator effects on the lifetime of @xmath3 , even though in a different approach , our results are consistent with theirs .",
