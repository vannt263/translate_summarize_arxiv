    "the orbital dynamics of compact objects ( black holes or neutron stars ) provides one of the best testbeds of any gravitational theory @xcite .",

    "gravitational waves represent ripples in space - time curvature .",
    "the way to separate them from the background curvature is to look for the fast changing component of the curvature , in the high - frequency / geometric optics approximation isaacson .",
    "these perturbations of the background geometry then travel away with the speed of light .    in certain cases",
    "they can be described in terms of a post - newtonian ( pn ) approach , excellently reviewed in refs . @xcite .",
    "such an approach is restricted to i ) a weak - field regime , where gravity is weak compared to its strength at a black hole horizon and the distance@xmath0 is large compared to the horizon radius , @xmath1 ( here @xmath2 is the pn parameter , @xmath3 the gravitational constant , @xmath4 the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath5 and@xmath0 are the total mass and separation ) , and ii ) slow motions compared to the speed of light , @xmath6 . due to the virial theorem , @xmath7 .",
    "gravitational wave characteristics can be reliably computed in the framework of the pn formalism throughout the inspiral ( lasting from tiny values of @xmath8 to an upper value of the order of @xmath9 ) , after which a merger regime follows ( requiring a numerical analysis of the full nonlinear einstein equations ) and a ringdown of the finally merged object ( which can be described in terms of black hole perturbation theory @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively the full inspiral - merger - ringdown process is well encompassed by the effective one body approach @xcite , where the waveforms are calibrated by accurate numerical relativity simulations @xcite .",
    "efforts for the direct detection of gravitational waves emitted by compact binaries by the ground - based interferometric detectors ligo @xcite , kagra @xcite , virgo @xcite are under way and a detection is expected in a few years , based on the best estimated coalescence rates rates .",

    "is conservative . a classical tests of general relativity , the perihelion shift of planetary orbits is an 1pn effect .",
    "in the strong gravity regimes even without including the dissipative effects arising at 2.5pn orders and beyond nonspinning , the orbits could be extremely different from keplerian ones .",
    "as an example we mention zoom - whirl orbits , arising in geodesic calculations @xcite and numerical relativity simulations zoomwhirlnum , capture .",
    "corresponding contributions , that capture some of these features , arise at large pn parameters @xcite . in the conservative dynamics general relativistic effects contribute at 1pn and 2pn orders , but the spins of the components also couple with the orbital angular momentum and with themselves , leading to spin - orbit ( so ) and spin - spin ( ss ) effects .",
    "the mass quadrupole of the compact objects also modifies the binary orbits with quadrupole - monopole couplings ( qm ) .",
    "it is usual to trace back the quadrupole moment to rotation , in case of which the qm contributions to dynamics could be expressed in terms of the spin .",

    "in this paper we study the conservative dynamics of a spinning compact binary system .",
    "we rewrite the full set of conservative evolution equations , first derived in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , in terms of a set of dimensionless variables evolving in a dimensionless time , in a form suitable to monitor _ both bounded and unbounded orbits _ ( as defined by their osculating orbital elements in a local , newtonian sense ) .    in section [ var ]",
    "we introduce the dimensionless variables closely tied to the leading order dynamics . these include a ) dynamical quantities , which up to the 2pn conservative evolution are constants , b ) angular variables defined in reference systems selected by the orbital motion and total angular momentum , finally c ) spin angles .",
    "then in section [ perturb ] we introduce the perturbing force of the keplerian evolution , encompassing corrections from general relativity in the form of the 1pn and 2pn contributions and spin related corrections , namely the leading order",
    "so , ss and qm couplings . the contributions to the precessional evolutions are also enlisted .",
    "the full 2pn  conservative dynamics is presented in section [ 2pndynamics ] in the form of a generalisation of the lagrange planetary equations .",
    "first the evolution of 5 dimensionless orbital elements and of 4 spin angles is given in terms of the true anomaly .",
    "this is complemented by the evolution of the true anomaly in terms of the dimensionless time . as a result",
    "we obtain a closed system of first order differential equations .",
    "they are involved , nevertheless they exhibit a simple structure .",
    "suitable notations made this structure transparent .",
    "the dimensionless variables however do not evolve unconstrained . at the 2pn accuracy of the conservative motion",
    "there are constants of motion , expressible in terms of these variables .",
    "we give these constraints in terms of the dimensionless dynamical variables in section [ constraints ] .",
    "as for any constrained dynamical system , consistency checks need to be performed .",
    "this implies to take the time derivative of the constraints and to investigate their role from a dynamical point of view . in principle",
    "such constraints could lead to a ) new equations of motion , b ) new constraints , or c ) identities .",
    "section [ consistency ] is devoted to this involved analysis , with some of the computational details shifted to appendix enj2pn .",
    "we prove that the dynamical equations given in section 2pndynamics are exhaustive in describing the binary and spin evolution , as the time derivatives of the constraints lead to identities .",
    "we fulfil the task by performing a series of consistency checks of the system of differential equations at each pn and spin order .    as an application of the derived formalism in section eccentrichyperbolic we analyse the possibility of having orbits which change from hyperbolic to elliptic and vice - versa , in terms of the eccentricity of the osculating ellipse , thus in a newtonian sense .",
    "the existence of such evolutions are to be expected , as general relativity predicts stronger gravity at short distances than the newtonian theory , as well known from the study of the stellar equilibrium .",
    "indeed , we find orbits dubbed _ chameleon _ , which appear elliptic ( locally , in a newtonian sense ) at short range , but transform into hyperbolic ( in the same sense ) at larger distances",
    ". finally section [ core ] contains the concluding remarks .    throughout the paper",
    "an overhat denotes the direction of the respective vector .",
    "compact binary components with axial symmetry are characterised by their mass @xmath10 , their proper rotation encompassed in their dimensionless spin @xmath11 and their quadrupole coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "the mass of neutron stars is typically of @xmath13 solar masses .",
    "black holes on the other hand could have masses extending from a few solar masses ( for stellar mass black holes ) , up to @xmath14 solar masses ( for the largest mass supermassive black holes ) .",
    "we will frequently employ the total and reduced masses @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the mass ratio @xmath17 $ ] and its symmetrical counterpart @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "kerr black holes in extreme rotation provide the upper bound of the dimensionless spin parameter , which for general relativistic black holes is constrained as @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "faster rotation would destroy the horizon , rendering them into naked singularities . in order to estimate the range of @xmath20 for neutron stars , we proceed as follows . from the expression of the spin magnitudes",
    "@xmath21 we rewrite the dimensionless spin as a ratio of two dimensionless parameters : @xmath22 . for a neutron star of @xmath13 solar masses and radius of @xmath23",
    "km the denominator is @xmath24 .",
    "approximating the neutron star to leading order by a rigid sphere , the numerator becomes @xmath25 @xmath26 , hence @xmath27 . unless the surface rotational velocity @xmath28 of the neutron star is higher than half of the speed of light ( typical observed rotational velocities are much smaller ) , for neutron stars @xmath29 @xmath30 $ ] also holds . has a much smaller value due to their non - compactness .",
    "hence in the dynamics spin - orbit coupling terms containing @xmath20 could dominate over general relativistic corrections , while spin - spin terms with @xmath31 or quadrupole - monopole terms with @xmath32 could become even larger . ]    when the quadrupole moment arises from rotation rather than asymmetric mass distribution , @xmath33 holds for general relativistic black holes thorne 1980 , while for neutron stars @xmath34 $ ] , depending on their equation of state @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the newtonian expressions of the energy , orbital angular momentum and laplace - runge - lenz vector of a binary system are@xmath35they obey the constraints @xmath36and are constants to keplerian order . as it is well - known",
    ", the keplerian orbit is a conic section characterised by these constants .      when general relativistic corrections in the weak field and slow motion approximation are taken into account as pn and 2pn corrections ; also by including the modifications to the dynamics due to leading so , ss and qm couplings , the orbit ceases to be a conic section in the strict sense , nevertheless it can be well approximated by a conic section locally .",
    "this local approximant is the osculating orbit , defined as the keplerian orbit with the same orbital state vectors ( position and velocity ) as for the orbit realised in the presence of the perturbations .",
    "it is easy to see then that the dynamical constants of the osculating orbit are @xmath37 , restricted by the constraints ( constr ) .",
    "the perturbed orbit can be envisaged as a sequence of conic sections , the orbital elements of which slowly evolve .",
    "one can therefore characterise the osculating orbit ( the instantaneous keplerian orbit , the orbital parameters of which evolve in time ) by the above introduced 5 independent and time - evolving variables . the additional information encoded in the orbital state vectors",
    "is @xmath38 .",
    "the 5 independent dynamical variables are equivalent to a similar number of orbital elements . to show this , first we define two independent variables characterising the shape of the osculating orbit , which are both dimensionless and equally apply for bounded or unbounded orbits .",
    "these are a dimensionless version of the newtonian orbital angular momentum and the orbital eccentricity , defined as : @xmath39 in these variables the newtonian expression of the energy reads ( see the second constraint ( [ constr])):@xmath40which is manifestly negative for circular ( @xmath41 ) or elliptical orbits ( @xmath42 , zero for parabolic orbits ( @xmath43 ) and positive for hyperbolic orbits ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "note that @xmath45 is related to the semi - latus rectum @xmath46 of the conic orbit as @xmath47 and to the periastron @xmath48 as @xmath49note that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are equivalent , thus a collision course is possible only for vanishing orbital angular momentum . for bounded orbits",
    "we can also introduce the semimajor axis @xmath52 . and",
    "radial eccentricity @xmath53 in terms of the conserved energy and @xmath54-component of the orbital angular momentum of kerr orbits , as introduced for bounded orbits in ref .",
    "]    for the three euler angles , defining the orientation of the plane of motion and the orientation of the orbit in this plane we chose the following : the inclination @xmath55 of the plane of orbit with respect to the reference plane ( which is chosen perpendicular to the total angular momentum @xmath56 ) , the longitude of the ascending node @xmath57 ( measured from an arbitrary axis @xmath58 lying in the reference plane to the ascending node @xmath59 , defined by the intersection of the reference plane with the plane of motion ) and the argument of the periastron @xmath60 ( measured from the ascending node to the periastron in the plane of motion , see fig 2 . of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . these three euler angles together with ( @xmath61 ) are equivalent with the set of dynamical variables ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) , as only five of the latter are independent due to the constraints ( constr ) .",
    "note that the definition of the above angles is meaningful only when the ascending node and the periastron can be defined , thus alternative definitions of the angles are required in the cases a ) of evolutions which are either nonspinning or the spins are aligned to the orbital angular momentum , when the ascending node can not be defined in the above sense , and b ) for circular orbits , when there is no periastron .",
    "we regard these however as configurations of measure zero in the generic parameter space , which need special attention .",
    "the formalism developed in this paper is well suited for precessing configurations and noncircular orbits .",
    "the spin polar and azimuthal angles are @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( when measured from the ascending node ) , or @xmath67(when measured from the periastron ) . in this paper",
    "we employ the latter , as this will simplify the notations .",
    "finally we mention the last angular variable necessary for the description of the compact binary dynamics .",
    "the position of the reduced mass particle is characterised by its azimuthal angle , this is @xmath68 when measured from the periastron , or @xmath69 when measured from the ascending node",
    ". the other quantity , which defines its instantaneous position is the distance @xmath70 measured from the focal point , where the potential generated by the ( fixed ) total mass @xmath5 is centered . its relation with the already introduced quantities will be discussed next .",
    "the true anomaly parametrization @xmath71 of the osculating orbit is the same as for the keplerian motion @xmath72with the important difference that the dynamical quantities @xmath73 and @xmath74 evolve with the osculating orbit .",

    "inspiral2 , which holds true in the newton - wigner - price @xcite spin supplementary condition ( ssc ) , employed in this paper .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless versions for the total energy and angular momentum magnitude as@xmath82note that unlike other quantities employed in this section ( characteristic to the local approximant of the real orbit , e.g. to the osculating orbit ) , the total energy and angular momentum ( also their dimensionless versions ) characterise the real orbit .",

    "in this paper we have considered the conservative evolution of spinning compact binaries up to the second post - newtonian order accuracy , by including the leading order spin - orbit , spin - spin and mass quadrupole - monopole contributions .",
    "the novel feature of the discussion is that it had been presented in terms of suitably chosen dimensionless variables .",
    "these are i ) the variables replacing the traditional orbital elements of celestial mechanics : a dimensionless version of the orbital angular momentum , the eccentricity and three euler angles characterising the orientation of the orbit and the orbital plane with respect to the total angular momentum vector , also ii ) dimensionless spin magnitudes ( smaller than one for both black holes and neutron stars ) together with the spin azimuthal and polar angles .",
    "the preferred reference system of this analysis is tied to the orbital angular momentum and periastron .    as a main result we derived a system of first order differential equations in a compact form , for a set of 9 dimensionless variables encompassing both the orbital elements and the spin angles ( the spin magnitudes being conserved ) .",
    "these are supplemented by the evolution equation of the true anomaly , which closes the differential system .",
    "these evolutions are constrained by the conservation laws of energy and total angular momentum vector holding at 2pn  order .",
    "as required by the generic theory of constrained dynamical systems we analyzed the consistency of the constraints , e.g. their compatibility with the evolution equations , and proved that they are preserved by the evolution .",
    "we applied the formalism to show the existence of orbits with unusual features .",
    "close to the periastron , the osculating orbits of these trajectories with eccentricity close to one change from hyperbolic to elliptic , then back to hyperbolic .",
    "hence these orbits ( as characterised by the eccentricity of their osculating orbit ) look open , then closed , then open again during the passage through the periastron .",
    "these _ chameleon _ _ orbits _ evolve from elliptic ( locally , in a newtonian sense ) close to the periastron into hyperbolic ( in the same sense ) at large distances .",
    "such a property emerges due to the fact that general relativity predicts stronger gravity ( deeper potential wells ) at short distances than newtonian theory does , as also illustrated by the hydrostatic equilibrium in relativistic stars .",
    "we analysed the chameleon orbits as function of mass ratios and spin orientations , for aligned and anti - aligned spin and orbital angular momentum configurations . without spin , these orbits are symmetric with respect to the periastron .",
    "the farther the mass ratio is from unity , the larger is the change in the eccentricity of the osculating orbit , hence the easier to find such chameleon orbits .",
    "the presence of spins can not be detected when the masses are equal and the spins anti - aligned with each other . in all other cases with spin , they induce an asymmetry with respect to the periastron .",
    "one aspect of this asymmetry is that the minimum of the eccentricity is not in the periastron , as can be seen on figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig3 ] . as a rule we found that the alignment of the total spin @xmath317 with the orbital angular momentum shifts the minimum eccentricity point of the trajectory before the periastron , while the anti - alignment shifts it after the periastron .",
    "these results hold both in the equal mass and in the asymmetric mass cases .",
    "this feature of relativistic orbits is complementary to how the rotation or counterrotation of a particle in circular orbit about a rotating black hole affects the location of the innermost stable orbit . in our case co - rotation",
    "apparently speeds up the ( reduced mass ) particle , while counter - rotation slows it down , after leaving the periastron .",
