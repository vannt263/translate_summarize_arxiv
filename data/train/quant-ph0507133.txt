    "the _ geneva  brussels _ ( _ gb _ ) _ approach _ to quantum mechanics ( qm ) is well known .",
    "it was started by jauch and piron in geneva @xcite , @xcite and then continued by aerts and his collaborators in brussels @xcite@xcite .",
    "it can be classified in the field of `` quantum structures research '' @xcite , aiming both at basing qm on fundamental concepts that can be operationally defined and at providing a physical justification of the relations established by qm among these concepts . in its latest version",
    "it also proposes , however , some fundamental changes of the standard theory in order to avoid a number of quantum problems and paradoxes and overcome the limits of the qm description of the physical world ( with special attention to compound quantum systems ) .",
    "the gb approach exhibits two relevant features .",
    "firstly , quantum probabilities are interpreted as _ epistemic _ ( they express our ignorance about _ hidden measurements _ rather than about hidden states of the physical system ) , at variance with the standard interpretation , where quantum probabilities are ( mostly ) ontologic . secondly , the mathematical structure of the set of _ empirical propositions _ called quantum logic ( ql ) is interpreted as a consequence of our `` possibilities of active experimenting '' on physical systems , not as a new logic formalizing some `` process of our reflection '' , so that ql does not characterize the microscopic world ( indeed , when our possibilities of active experimenting on a _ macroscopic _ entity are suitably limited , one can find quantum logical structures associated with this entity )",
    ".    the above features also appear within the _ semantic realism _",
    "( _ sr _ ) _ interpretation _ of qm propounded by the lecce research group on the foundations of qm as an alternative to the standard interpretation @xcite@xcite , aiming to avoid the same problems and paradoxes considered by the gb approach .",
    "moreover , the sr interpretation also implies that a broader theory embodying qm is , at least in principle , possible .",
    "this suggests that a comparison between the two perspectives could be interesting , and that an attempt at extablishing links between them could be fruitful . yet , whenever one starts this job , one immediately meets a serious difficulty .",
    "indeed , the gb approach is highly contextual , following in this sense the standard qm tradition . on the contrary",
    ", the sr interpretation mantains that contextuality is the root of most quantum paradoxes and elaborates a strategy ( based on some epistemological criticisms to the standard interpretation ) to avoid it without conflicting with the mathematical apparatus and the predictions of qm .",
    "thus the two approaches seem conceptually incompatible at first sight .",
    "however , a deeper insight shows that this is not necessarily the case .",
    "we can not yet prove this by providing a general perspective in which both approaches find a proper place , but we can show that an integration is possible in the case of the models introduced in the gb and sr approaches as intuitive supports to general reasonings ( and also as a demonstration of consistency of some abstract assumptions , especially within the sr interpretation ) . to be precise ,",
    "we intend to show in the present paper that a macroscopic version of the intuitive picture for the sr model provided in some previous papers @xcite , @xcite ( briefly , _ microscopic sr model _ in the following ) can be constructed which embodies aerts _ quantum machine _ ( which plays an important role in aerts approach since it provides a macroscopic model for spin measurements on spin@xmath0 quantum systems ) .",
    "this _ unified _ ( _ sr _ ) _ model _ provides the same predictions as aerts quantum machine whenever one takes into account those and only those samples of the physical system under investigation that are actually detected if a measurement is performed . in this sense",
    "we can say that the two models are formally equivalent ( the equivalence is attained , however , by means of a rather artificial and complicate construction , which does not aim to represent any physical reality but only to illustrate a logical possibility ) .",
    "it must still be stressed that our unified model applies to quantum systems described by two dimensional hilbert spaces , just as the quantum machine .",
    "the gb approach provides , however , more general models which apply to higher dimensional quantum cases .",
    "embodying these models within a generalized unified ( sr ) model seems possible in principle ( the microscopic sr model makes no reference to the dimensionality of the hilbert space of the system ) but it may raise some problems .",
    "in particular , it could be difficult in this case to reconciliate the contextuality of the gb models with the noncontextuality of the sr model .",
    "we do not discuss this problem in the present paper and limit ourselves to note that the remarks in sec .",
    "4.1 on the different notions of contextuality introduced in the literature may help in solving it .",
    "finally , let us briefly resume the content of the various sections of our paper .",
    "firstly , we sketch the guidelines of the microscopic sr model and quantum machine in secs . 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "this leads us , in particular , to complete the microscopic sr model by means of some equations which do not appear in the original draft .",
    "then , our unified model is introduced in sec .",
    "4 , it is discussed in the case of pure states in sec .",
    "4.1 , and it is generalized to the case of mixed states in sec . 4.2 .",
    "as we have anticipated in the introduction , the consistency of the sr approach has recently been demonstrated by means of a set  theoretical model , the microscopic sr model , that shows , circumventing known no  go theorems , how a local and noncontextual ( hence objective ) picture of the microworld can be constructed without altering the formalism and the ( statistical ) interpretation of qm .",
    "we report the essentials of it here .    to begin with ,",
    "let us accept the standard notion of state of a physical system @xmath1 as a class of physically equivalent preparing devices @xcite .",
    "furthermore , let us call _ physical object _ any individual sample @xmath2 of @xmath1 obtained by activating a preparing device , and say that _ x is in the state @xmath3 _ if the device @xmath4 preparing @xmath2 belongs to @xmath3 .",
    "whenever @xmath1 is a microscopic physical system , let us introduce a set @xmath5 of _ microscopic _ physical properties that characterize @xmath1 and play the role of theoretical entities . for every physical object @xmath2 , every property @xmath6 is associated with @xmath2 in a dichotomic way ,",
    "so that one briefly says that every @xmath6 either is possessed or it is not possessed by @xmath2 .",
    "this is the main difference between the sr interpretation and the ortodox interpretation of qm , in which it is assumed that microphysical objects generally do not possess a property until it is measured @xcite .",
    "the set @xmath7 of all _ macroscopic _ properties is then introduced as in standard qm , that is , it is defined as the set of all pairs of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is an observable ( that is , a class of physically equivalent measuring apparatuses ) with spectrum @xmath10 , and @xmath11 a borel set on the real line @xmath12 ( for every observable @xmath9 , different borel sets containing the same subset of @xmath10 obviously define physically equivalent properties ; we note explicitly that , whenever we speak about macroscopic properties in the following , we actually understand such classes of physically equivalent macroscopic properties ) . yet , every observable @xmath9 is obtained from a suitable observable @xmath13 of standard qm by adding to the spectrum @xmath14 of @xmath13 a further outcome @xmath15 that does not belong to @xmath16 , called the _ no  registration _ outcome of @xmath17 ( note that such an outcome is introduced also within the standard quantum theory of measurement , but it plays here a different theoretical role ) , so that @xmath18 .",
    "the set @xmath5 of all microscopic properties is then assumed to be in one  to ",
    "one correspondence with the subset @xmath19  of all macroscopic properties of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath9 is an observable and @xmath21 .    basing on the above definitions and assumptions",
    ", one can provide the following description of the measurement process . whenever a physical object @xmath2 is prepared in a state @xmath3 by a given device @xmath4 , and @xmath9 is measured by means of a suitable apparatus ,",
    "the set of microscopic properties possessed by @xmath2 produces a probability ( which is either 0 or 1 if the model is _ deterministic _ ) that the apparatus does not react , so that the outcome @xmath15 may be obtained . in this case",
    ", @xmath2 is not detected and one can not get any explicit information about the microscopic physical properties possessed by @xmath2 .",
    "if , on the contrary , the apparatus reacts , an outcome different from @xmath15 , say @xmath22 , is obtained , and one is informed that @xmath2 possesses all microscopic properties associated with macroscopic properties of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath11 is a borel set such that @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( for the sake of brevity we also say that @xmath2 _ possesses _ all macroscopic properties as @xmath25 in this case ) .    in order to place properly quantum probability within the above picture ,",
    "let us consider a preparing device @xmath26 that is activated repeatedly . in this case",
    "a ( finite ) set @xmath27 of physical objects in the state @xmath3 is prepared .",
    "then , let us partition @xmath27 into subsets @xmath28 , @xmath29 , ... , @xmath30 , such that in each subset all objects possess the same _ microscopic _ properties ( we can briefly say that the objects in @xmath31 , possessing the same microscopic properties , are in the same _ microstate _",
    "@xmath32 ) , and assume that a measurement of an observable @xmath9 is done on every object .",
    "finally , let us introduce the following symbols ( see * fig . 1 * ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     * fig .",

    "\\(v ) the number @xmath39 of physical objects in @xmath31 that possess the macroscopic property @xmath20 , with @xmath40 , corresponding to the microscopic property @xmath33 .",
    "it is apparent that the number @xmath39 either coincides with @xmath41 or with @xmath42 .",
    "the former case occurs whenever @xmath33 is possessed by the objects in @xmath31 , since all objects that are detected then yield outcome in @xmath43 .",
    "the latter case occurs whenever @xmath33 is not possessed by the objects in @xmath31 , since all objects that are detected then yield outcome different from @xmath15 but outside @xmath11 ( note that the microscopic property @xmath44 corresponding to @xmath45 is possessed by the objects in @xmath31 in this case ) . in both cases",
    "one can assume that @xmath46 or @xmath47 , hence either @xmath48 or @xmath49 , so that the assumption @xmath46 does not hold .",
    "however , @xmath50 implies @xmath51 , and eq .",

    "the fraction of objects in @xmath35 that possess the property @xmath25 is given by @xmath55 let us assume now that all fractions of objects converge in the large number limit , so that they can be substituted by probabilities , and that these probabilities do not depend on the choice of the preparing device @xmath56 in @xmath3 . hence , if one considers the large number limit of eq .",
    "( [ micro1 ] ) , one gets @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the total probability that a physical object @xmath2 which possesses the microscopic properties that characterize @xmath31 , _",
    "i.e. _ , which is in the state @xmath32 , also possesses the property @xmath25 , @xmath59 is the probability that @xmath2 is detected when @xmath25 is measured on it , @xmath60 ( which is either @xmath42 or @xmath54 ) is the probability that @xmath2 possesses the property @xmath25 when detected .",
    "analogously , the large number limit of eq .",
    "( [ macro1 ] ) yields @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the total probability that a physical object @xmath2 in a state @xmath3 possesses the property @xmath25 , @xmath63 is the probability that @xmath2 is detected when @xmath25 is measured on it , @xmath64 is the probability that @xmath2 possesses the property @xmath25 when detected .    if we identify the previous probabilities with the corresponding fractions of objects in the large number limit , it is possible to express the macroscopic probabilities in eq .",
    "( [ macro2 ] ) in terms of the microscopic probabilities in eq .",
    "( [ micro2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath65 @xmath66 where we have identified the fraction of objects in the microstate @xmath32 with respect to the objects in the state @xmath3 with the conditional probability @xmath67 that an object @xmath2 in the state @xmath3 actually is in the microstate @xmath32 .",
    "analogously , we get @xmath68 @xmath69 the interpretation of @xmath64 makes it reasonable to identify this probability with the quantum probability that a physical object in the state @xmath3 possesses the property @xmath25 .",
    "hence , standard qm can be recovered within the model as the theory that allows one to evaluate @xmath64 ( and its evolution in time ) for every system @xmath1 , state @xmath3 , and property @xmath20 such that @xmath23 . in this perspective , no change of the formalism and the statistical interpretation of standard qm is required . in particular , any state @xmath3 can be represented , as usual , by means of a trace class operator @xmath70 on a hilbert space @xmath71 associated with @xmath1 and any macroscopic property @xmath25 that corresponds to a microscopic property can be represented by means of a projection operator @xmath72 on @xmath73 , so that @xmath74 . thus , the model provides a picture of the microworld which embodies standard qm .",
    "this picture is objective , in the sense that for every physical object @xmath2 in the state @xmath3 , every macroscopic property of the form @xmath75 ( where @xmath15 may now belong or not to @xmath43 ) either is possessed or is not possessed by @xmath2 , and the probability that it is possessed / not possessed is determined by the microscopic properties possessed by @xmath2 , which do not depend on the measuring apparatus ( hence microscopic properties play in the model a role similar to states in objective local theories @xcite ) .",
    "objectivity has some relevant consequences .",
    "we list here some of them .",
    "\\(i ) the probabilities that appear in the microscopic sr model are epistemic , since they can be interpreted as due to a lack of knowledge about microscopic properties .",
    "\\(ii ) the local and noncontextual picture of the microworld provided by the microscopic sr model is inconsistent with the bell and the bell  kocken  specker theorems .",
    "one it can show that it violates an assumption underlying those theorems , which is usually left implicit .",
    "whenever this assumption is stated explicitly , it proves to be physically problematical @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , which makes its violation admissible .",
    "\\(iii ) from the viewpoint of the model , qm is a theory that is incomplete in several senses ( it does not provide the probabilities @xmath62 and @xmath63 and it does not say anything about the distribuition of microscopic properties on physical objects in a given state whenever the objects are not detected ) . from this viewpoint , a broader theory embodying qm can be envisaged , according to which the quantum probability @xmath64 is considered as a conditional rather than an absolute probability .",
    "\\(iv ) the microscopic properties that appear in the model are hidden parameters , but are not hidden variables in the standard sense .",
    "indeed , it can be proved @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that they are not bound to satisfy in every physical situation the condition introduced by kocken and specker as a basic requirement `` for the successful introduction of hidden variables '' @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this explains why microscopic properties are noncontextual .",
    "\\(v ) the no  registration outcome does not occur because of flaws of the measuring apparatus , but it is determined by the microscopic properties of the physical object . hence , @xmath63 may be less than @xmath54 also in the case of ideal apparatuses .",
    "by introducing the entity called _ quantum machine _ @xcite@xcite one can produce a macroscopic model for measurements on a quantum system described by a two  dimensional hilbert space ( _ e.g. _ , a spin@xmath0 quantum particle whenever only spin observables are taken into account ) , which suggests that quantum probabilities can be reinterpreted as epistemic rather than ontologic .",
    "2*. _ a three dimensional representation of the _ quantum machine _ as proposed by aerts . _",
    "the quantum machine consists of a classical point particle bound to stay on the surface of a spherical ball with radius @xmath54 .",
    "hence each pure state of the machine is represented by a point @xmath76 of this surface , or , equivalently , by a position vector @xmath77 belonging to the unitary _",
    "aerts sphere_. furthermore , each possible experiment connected to the quantum machine can be described as follows .",
    "consider two diametrically opposite points on the aerts sphere , briefly identified with the ( unitary ) position vectors @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively , and install an elastic strip of @xmath80 units of length , fixed with one of its end ",
    "points in @xmath78 and the other end  point in @xmath79 ( * fig . 2 ( a ) * ) .",
    "whenever the experiment is performed , the particle falls from its original place orthogonally onto the elastic , and sticks to it ( * fig .",
    "2 ( b ) * ) . then , the elastic breaks at some arbitrary point . consequently the particle , attached to one of the two pieces of the elastic ( * fig .",
    "2 ( c ) * ) , is pulled to one of the two end  points @xmath78 or @xmath79 ( * fig .",
    "2 ( d ) * ) . now , depending on whether the particle arrives in @xmath78 or in @xmath79 , we give the outcome @xmath81 or @xmath82 to the experiment .        * fig .",
    "3*. _ representation of the experimental process in the plane where it takes place .",
    "_    let us now calculate the probabilities of the two outcomes .",
    "if we demand that the elastic , installed between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , can break at any point of this interval with the same probability , the probability @xmath83 that the particle ends up in point @xmath78 , so that the experiment gives outcome @xmath81 , when the quantum machine is in the state represented by the vector @xmath77 , is given by the length of the piece of elastic @xmath84 divided by the total length of the elastic ( * fig .",
    "the probability @xmath85 that the particle ends up in point @xmath79 , so that the experiment gives outcome @xmath82 , when the quantum machine is in the state represented by the vector @xmath77 , is given by the length of the piece of elastic @xmath86 divided by the total length of the elastic .",
    "thus we get @xmath87 @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the angle between @xmath78 and @xmath77 .",
    "it is well known that the above probabilities coincide with the probabilities that appear in spin measurements on a spin@xmath0 quantum particle .",
    "indeed , a pure ( spin ) state of such a particle is represented by the vector @xmath90 of the self  adjoint operator @xmath91 , representing the observable _ spin along the direction _ @xmath92 .",
    "this establishes a correspondence @xmath93 between vectors representing pure states of the spin@xmath0 quantum particle and points of the surface of a sphere with radius @xmath54 centered in the origin of @xmath94 ( _ bloch sphere representation _ ) .",
    "this correspondence is one  to  one ( up to a phase factor ) and obviously induces a bijective mapping of the set of states of the spin@xmath0 quantum particle on the set of states of the classical point particle considered above .",
    "then , let us consider a measurement of the observable @xmath95 represented by the operator @xmath96 , with @xmath97 , on the spin@xmath0 quantum particle in a state represented by the vector @xmath98 , and let us denote by @xmath89 the angle between the two vectors @xmath78 and @xmath99 .",
    "it is easy to prove that the probabilities @xmath100 and @xmath101 that the measurement yields results @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively , are given by @xmath104 @xmath105 which coincide with the probabilities @xmath83 and @xmath85 in eqs .",
    "( [ aerts1 ] ) and ( [ aerts2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "hence , our measurement is equivalent to performing an experiment with the quantum machine in the state represented by the vector @xmath99 and the elastic installed between @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "it follows that the quantum machine provides a macroscopic model for measures of the spin of a spin@xmath0 quantum particle or , more generally , for any quantum system associated with a two  dimensional complex hilbert space .",
    "the models described in the previous sections have different features and have been constructed with different aims .",
    "the microscopic sr model is a noncontextual general model for measurements on any kind of quantum system , aiming to demonstrate the consistency of the sr interpretation of qm .",
    "the quantum machine provides a macroscopic model for measurements on quantum systems described by two dimensional hilbert spaces , aiming in particular to suggest some enlargements of qm which would allow us to go beyond its present limits , which is classified by the authors as _ _ highly contextual__@xcite ( in the sense that the result of a measurement depends also on the measuring apparatus and not only on the state of the particle that is measured ) .",
    "there are however some remarkable analogies between the two models .",
    "let us point out some of them .",
    "first of all , in both models probabilities are epistemic , which follows from the adoption of two `` nonstandard '' hidden variables theories .",
    "an measurement on the quantum machine is an example of _ hidden measurement _",
    ", in the sense that probabilities appear because of lack of knowledge about the specific measurement that is actually performed on the entity ( namely , one does not know the specific point in which the elastic breaks ) , not because of lack of knowledge about states of a quantum object , as in a standard hidden variables theory .",
    "the epistemicity of probabilities in the microscopic sr model follows instead both from lack of knowledge about the microstates ( as in a standard hidden variables theory ) and about the measurement ( unknown probability of the @xmath106 outcome in a microstate ) ; this lack of knowledge disappears , however , in a deterministic model , see footnote 1 ) .",
    "hence , the microscopic sr model ( which is noncontextual and local ) can also be considered a nonstandard hidden variables theory .",
    "secondly , both models reproduce quantum probabilities by introducing suitable conditions . within the quantum machine model",
    "only elastic measurements are permitted . within the microscopic sr model",
    "quantum probabilities follow whenever one considers only objects that are actually detected .",
    "bearing in mind the above similarities , one may wonder whether a macroscopic version of the microscopic sr model can be constructed which embodies aerts quantum machine . at first sight",
    "this task seems impossible because of the opposite features of the two models with respect to contextuality .",
    "we show in the next sections that the problem can be overcome and construct the desired model .",
    "bearing in mind the microscopic sr model discussed in sec .",
    "2 , we modify aerts quantum machine as illustrated in * fig .",
    "4*. to be precise , let us suppose that the classical point particle that is in the point @xmath76 , hence in the state @xmath3 represented by the vector @xmath77 according to aerts model , is actually in one of the points on the surface of the second sphere ( _ detection sphere _ ) , which is identical to aerts sphere and tangent to it in the point @xmath76 .",
    "let us install an elastic of @xmath80 units of length in the direction determined by the vector @xmath77 .",
    "whenever a measurement is performed , the particle falls orthogonally onto the elastic , then the elastic breaks in some arbitrary point and the particle ends up in one of the two extremal points of the elastic .",
    "if the particle ends up in the contact point @xmath76 with aerts sphere , then we say that the particle is _ detected _ and , in this case , the experimental process can give one of two outcomes , @xmath81 or @xmath82 , with the probabilities predicted by aerts model . on the contrary , if the particle ends up in the other extreme , we say that it is _ not detected _ and , in this case , the outcome @xmath106 is obtained .",
    "4*. _ representation of the detection and the quantum measurement in the plane where they take place .",
    "_    let us remind that in the microscopic sr model every pure state @xmath3 of the physical system can be split into microstates @xmath32 , and let us identify these _ hidden _ states in our model with the points on the surface of the detection sphere .",
    "furthermore , let us note that the macroscopic property @xmath25 in sec .",
    "2 can be identified now either ( i ) with the pair @xmath107 , or ( ii ) with the pair @xmath108 .",
    "the measurements of both properties are performed in the same way , hence we can assume that the detection probability @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ newprobability - d ] ) does not depend on @xmath81 and @xmath82 but only on @xmath78 , and write it @xmath109 in our particular case .",
    "therefore the detection probability @xmath63 will be written @xmath110 in our case and eq .",
    "( [ newprobability - d ] ) becomes @xmath111 let @xmath112 be the spherical coordinates of the point of the detection sphere which correspond to the microstate @xmath113 when the polar axis is chosen parallel to @xmath77 .",
    "let us reason as in sec .",
    "3 , yet assuming that the probability that the elastic in the detection sphere breaks at some arbitrary point is not the same for every point , but is described by a probability distribution depending on @xmath89 .",
    "hence , we put @xmath114 whence @xmath115 the conditional probabilities @xmath67 are not predetermined and it is possible to make assumptions on them .",
    "for example , by considering the continuum limit , we can substitute @xmath32 with @xmath116 and introduce the following assumptions , based on symmetry arguments .",
    "\\(i ) the conditional probability density is independent of the spherical coordinate @xmath117 , hence @xmath118 .",
    "\\(ii ) only the hidden states belonging to the surface of a spherical cap @xmath119 centered in @xmath76 have a conditional probability density @xmath120 different from @xmath42 , and the limit angle @xmath121 of the cap depends on the vector @xmath77 , hence we write @xmath122 .    because of the above assumptions , the probability @xmath123 is given by @xmath124    one can make the model more specific by adding suitable assumptions on @xmath125 and @xmath120 . in any case , if we require that the particle has to be in a definite state , @xmath120 must be such that @xmath126    let us consider now eq . ( [ macro2 ] ) and the two possibilities ( i ) @xmath127 and ( ii ) @xmath128 .",
    "it is apparent that in case ( i ) @xmath64 coincides with the probability @xmath129 in eq .",
    "( [ aerts1 ] ) , while in case ( ii ) it coincides with @xmath130 in eq .",
    "( [ aerts2 ] ) .",
    "hence , we get @xmath131 @xmath132    in order to complete the model from an sr viewpoint , we must still point out two properties @xmath133 and @xmath134 of the classical point particle which correspond to @xmath135 and @xmath108 , respectively , and state a criterion for establishing whether @xmath133 or @xmath134 is possessed by the particle in a given hidden state @xmath113 .",
    "this can be done as follows .",
    "firstly , partition the spherical cap @xmath119 considered above into a inner spherical cap @xmath136 centered in @xmath76 and an outer spherical crown @xmath137 .",
    "then assume that @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "finally , assume that a particle in a hidden state belonging to @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) produces a breakdown of the elastic in the segment @xmath84 ( @xmath86 ) of * fig .",
    "3 * , hence outcome @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) . the properties @xmath133 and @xmath134",
    "are then characterized by the set of hidden states in @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively , and the factors @xmath140 and @xmath141 in eqs .",
    "( [ goodform_1 ] ) and ( [ goodform_2 ] ) , respectively , are explained in terms of microstates .    the construction of our unified model is thus concluded .",
    "however , this opens a new problem .",
    "indeed , the new model is a macroscopic version of the microscopic sr model , which we classified as noncontextual at the beginning of this section .",
    "one may then wonder how it was possible to embody in it the quantum machine , which provides a model which was classified instead as highly contextual by the authors themselves .",
    "the answer to this question is not trivial , and requires a brief preliminary analysis of the concept of contextuality .    according to a standard viewpoint , a physical theory is contextual whenever the value of an observable @xmath95 in a given state of a physical system depends on the set of ( compatible ) measurements that are simultaneously performed on the system @xcite .",
    "we call this kind of contextuality here _ contextuality@xmath142 _ , and note that no reference is made in its definition to individual differences between apparatuses measuring @xmath95 , which are thus implicitly considered ideal and identical . on the contrary , according to the gb approach the contextuality of the quantum machine follows from the fact that each individual experiment introduces a different set of hidden variables of the measuring apparatus , so that different measurements of the same observable may yield different results @xcite .",
    "this provides implicitly a different definition of contextuality , that we call here _",
    "contextuality@xmath143 _ , which makes reference to the differences that unavoidably exist between individual apparatuses measuring @xmath95 .",
    "let us come now to the microscopic sr model and to the quantum machine .",
    "the former can be classified as noncontextual when contextuality@xmath142 is understood ( indeed , the result of a measurement depends only on the microscopic properties possessed by the physical object that one is considering , that is , on the microscopic state @xmath113 of the object ) of the microscopic sr model is accepting that the laws of qm can not be applied to those physical situations that are unaccessible , _ in principle _ , to empirical control @xcite@xcite .",
    "such situations actually occur in qm because of the existence of incompatible observables .",
    "we stress that this feature of the sr model allows one to avoid a number of paradoxes without conflicting with the theoretical description and the predictions of qm ( which refer to detected physical objects only ) . ] .",
    "if , on the contrary , contextuality@xmath143 is understood and the detection probability @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ newprobability - d ] ) is interpreted as expressing lack of knowledge on the interaction between the measurement and the physical object , the microscopic sr model can be classified as contextual ( but also this kind of contextuality disappears if the sr model is deterministic ) .",
    "analogously , it is apparent that the measurements on the quantum machine are noncontextual if contextuality@xmath144 is understood ( indeed , measurements with the elastic strip in different directions are never compatible ) . on the contrary ,",
    "they are highly contextual , as stated in the gb approach , if contextuality@xmath145 is understood . our problem above is thus solved .",
    "it is still interesting to observe that our unified model reduces in some sense the contextuality@xmath145 of the measurements on the quantum machine because of the final part of our construction above .",
    "indeed , it is apparent that the unknown features of an experiment on the quantum machine ( the point in which the elastic breaks ) , which affect the result of the measurement , are explained within our unified model in terms of the hidden states @xmath113 , hence only the contextuality@xmath145 following from the unknown probability of the @xmath106 outcome is left in the model .",
    "it remains to `` close the circle '' by showing that the above macroscopic model mimics a spin measurement of a spin@xmath0 quantum particle according to the microscopic sr model . to this end , let us consider the observable @xmath95 represented by the operator @xmath96 in standard qm ( sec .",
    "according to the microscopic sr model , this observable must actually contain in its spectrum , besides the values @xmath102 and @xmath103 , a further value @xmath106 that is considered as the outcome of a measurement when the physical object is not detected , hence it must be substituted by an observable @xmath146 ( we remind that the lack of detection is not interpreted as an inefficiency of the measuring apparatus , but as a consequence of the microscopic properties of the measured object , see sec .",
    "2 ) . let @xmath147 and @xmath148 be the probabilities of finding the outcomes @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively , in a measurement of the observable @xmath146 on a quantum particle in the state represented by the vector @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( [ bloch ] ) . by setting ( i ) @xmath149 and ( ii ) @xmath150 , these probabilities particularize in two different cases the probability @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ macro2 ] ) .",
    "both in ( i ) and ( ii ) the measurement of @xmath25 is performed by measuring @xmath146 , hence the detection probability @xmath63 that appears in ( [ macro2 ] ) is the same in both cases and we briefly denote it by @xmath151 . finally , @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ macro2 ] ) obviously coincides with @xmath100 ( see eq .",
    "( [ qm1 ] ) ) in case ( i ) and with @xmath101 ( see eq .",
    "( [ qm2 ] ) ) in case ( ii ) .",
    "thus , we get from eq .",
    "( [ macro2 ] ) , @xmath152 @xmath153 these equations coincide with eqs .",
    "( [ goodform_1 ] ) and ( [ goodform_2 ] ) , respectively , if one puts @xmath154 .",
    "we would like to stress that our unified model aims to provide a macroscopic analogue of a quantum measurement , but does not claim in any way to explain what actually occurs at a microscopic level .",
    "nevertheless , the unspecified factor @xmath123 reminds us that , according to the sr interpretation , qm is an incomplete theory which could be embedded , at least in principle , into a broader theory ( which is excluded by the standard interpretation ) .",
    "the unified model proposed in the previous section can be generalized to the case of nonpure ( mixed ) states or _",
    "mixtures_. let us shortly describe this generalization .",
    "let us broaden the set of states of the quantum machine by adding the inner points of the aerts sphere to the points on the surface as possible locations of the classical point particle .",
    "then , let us note that the state @xmath155 characterized by the vector @xmath156 such that @xmath157 can be written as a convex combination of the vectors @xmath158 and @xmath159 representing the pure states @xmath160 and @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "indeed , @xmath162 , with @xmath163 and @xmath164 ( hence @xmath165 and @xmath166 ) . if we then perform a measurement of the kind considered in sec .",
    "3 whenever the quantum machine is in the state @xmath155 ( see * fig .",
    "3 * with @xmath156 in place of @xmath77 ) , the probabilities of obtaining outcomes @xmath81 or @xmath82 are given by @xmath167 and @xmath168 respectively .",
    "let us now remind that not only pure states , but also mixed states of spin@xmath0 quantum particles can be represented on the bloch sphere . in fact , a mixed state represented in standard qm by the density operator @xmath169 ( where @xmath170 and @xmath171 are normalized and orthogonal vectors in the hilbert space of the system , @xmath172 , @xmath166 ) corresponds to the inner point of the bloch sphere characterized by the vector @xmath173 ( where @xmath77 and @xmath174 are the vectors corresponding to @xmath170 and @xmath171 , respectively , in the bloch representation discussed in sec .",
    "3 ) , with @xmath175 .",
    "it is then immediate to see that the probabilities @xmath176 and @xmath177 predicted by qm for a spin measurement in direction @xmath78 on a spin@xmath0 quantum particle in the state represented by @xmath178 coincide with the probabilities in eqs .",
    "( [ qm_mixed1 ] ) and ( [ qm_mixed2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "hence , the quantum machine provides a macroscopic model for this kind of measurements also in the case of mixed states .",
    "it must be stressed , however , that , according to aerts , @xmath155 is not interpreted as a mixed state of the quantum machine , which is highly relevant in aerts perspective @xcite .        *",
    "5*. _ representation of the detection and the quantum measurement for a mixed state in the plane where they take place .",
    "_    let us evaluate the probabilities @xmath179 and @xmath180 of finding the outcomes @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , in a measurement of the kind described in sec .",
    "4.1 whenever the quantum machine is in the state @xmath155 within our unified model .",
    "if we consider ( contrary to aerts ) the state @xmath155 as a mixture of the states @xmath160 and @xmath161 , the coefficients @xmath181 and @xmath182 can be interpreted as the probabilities that the quantum machine in the state @xmath155 is actually in the state @xmath160 or in the state @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "hence , we get @xmath183 @xmath184 the probabilities @xmath185 , @xmath186 , etc . , can be calculated by using eqs .",
    "( [ goodform_1 ] ) and ( [ goodform_2 ] ) .",
    "one gets , with @xmath187 and @xmath188 as in * fig . 5 * , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , etc . since ,",
    "now , @xmath160 and @xmath161 are represented by the opposite vectors @xmath77 and @xmath174 , respectively , and @xmath191 , the symmetries of the particular physical system at issue suggest to assume that @xmath192 . by setting @xmath193 and @xmath194 , we get @xmath195 @xmath196 proceeding as in sec .",
    "4.1 , the above probabilities can then be identified with the probabilities @xmath197 and @xmath198 , respectively , that a measurement of the observable @xmath199 on a spin@xmath0 quantum particle in the state represented by @xmath178 yields outcome @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively , according to the microscopic sr model .",
    "our unified model has thus been generalized to the case of mixtures , as desired .",
    "it must be stressed , however , that this has been done at the expense of betraying aerts original idea of not considering the state @xmath155 of the quantum machine as a mixture .",
    "the construction in sec .",
    "4 shows that aerts quantum machine can be used as a basis for producing a more complex model for quantum measurements on spin@xmath0 particles .",
    "the new model constitutes a macroscopic version of the microscopic model for quantum measurements introduced within the sr interpretation , hence it establishes a first formal link between the gb approach and the sr interpretation of qm .",
    "moreover , some relevant differences between the two approaches , which seemingly make them incompatible , are bypassed in the model .",
    "this suggests that they can be bypassed in general by using similar procedures , even if some difficulties could arise when considering models for quantum systems described by hilbert spaces whose dimension is greater that 2 . in any case , the model presented in this paper may serve as an intuitive basis for the attempt at linking together the gb approach and the sr intepretation , aiming to construct a broader theory going beyond the present limits of qm .",
