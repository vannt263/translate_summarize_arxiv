    "atomic physics experiments with quantum degenerate bose and fermi gases are characterized by the distinguishing features that we have ( i ) a detailed microscopic understanding of the hamiltonian of the systems realized in the laboratory , and ( ii ) complete control of the system parameters via external fields . in particular ,",
    "atoms can be trapped and their motion controlled in magnetic and optical traps , allowing , for example , the realization of quantum gases with different dimensionality at effectively zero temperature .",
    "in addition , atoms have many internal states which can be manipulated using laser light and can be employed as a probe of the gas properties , and their collisional properties can be tuned with magnetic and optical feshbach resonances .    in the early days of atomic bec experiments",
    "@xcite , the main focus was to investigate condensate properties of matter waves like coherence , as described theoretically by the hartree - fock - bogoliubov mean field theory for weakly interacting quantum gases .",
    "more recently , emphasis has shifted to strongly interacting systems , which are much more in line with present interests in theoretical condensed matter physics .",
    "in particular , as first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , strongly interacting systems can be realized with cold atomic gases in optical lattices , i.e. periodic arrays of microtraps generated by standing wave laser light fields .",
    "this leads to hubbard type lattice models , where atomic physics provides a whole toolbox to engineer various types of hamiltonians for 1d , 2d and 3d bose and fermi systems which can be controlled by varying external field parameters in a time dependent way .",
    "in addition , atomic physics provides systematic ways of loading these lattices with atoms .",
    "a prominent example is the mott insulator - superfluid quantum phase transition with cold bosonic atoms , as first observed in the seminal experiment by i. bloch and collaborators @xcite .",
    "more generally , we expect that cold atoms in optical lattices will be developed in the coming years as a general quantum simulator of lattice models , allowing experimental insight into phase diagrams for certain classes of ( toy ) models ( such as high-@xmath0 superconductivity ) and for parameter regimes , where no rigorous theoretical approaches exist .",
    "in addition , new theoretical challenges appear in this context , for example , the study of time - dependent phenomena . besides the condensed matter aspects ,",
    "the engineered hubbard models have direct application in quantum computing , where the controlled interactions can be used to create entanglement with high fidelity .    in the present article",

    "we will neglect spontaneous emission and later establish the consistency of this approximation by giving an estimate for the rate at which photons are spontaneously emitted in a typical optical lattice setup .",

    "the amplitude of the electric field @xmath11 is varying slowly in time @xmath12 compared to @xmath13 and slowly in space @xmath14 compared to the size of the atom . in this situation",
    "the interaction between atom and laser is adequately described in dipole approximation by the hamiltonian @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the dipole operator of the atom .",
    "we assume the laser to be far detuned from any optical transition so that no significant population is transferred from @xmath17 to any of the other internal atomic states via @xmath18 .",
    "we can thus treat the additional atomic levels in perturbation theory and eliminate them from the dynamics . in doing",
    "so we find the ac - stark shift of the internal state @xmath17 in the form of a conservative potential @xmath19 whose strength is determined by the atomic dipole operator and the properties of the laser light at the center of mass position @xmath14 of the atom .",
    "in particular @xmath19 is proportional to the laser intensity @xmath20 . under these conditions",
    "the motion of the atom is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath21 .",
    "let us now specialize the situation to the case where the dominant contribution to the optical potential arises from one excited atomic level @xmath22 only . in a frame rotating with the laser frequency the hamiltonian of the atom",

    "we start by superimposing two counter propagating running wave laser beams with @xmath32 propagating in @xmath33-direction with amplitude @xmath34 , wave number @xmath35 and wave length @xmath36 .",

    "we will use the wannier functions to describe particles trapped in the lattice since they allow ( i ) to attribute a mean position @xmath49 to the particles in a given mode and ( ii ) to easily account for local interactions between particles since the dominant contribution to the interaction energy arises from particles occupying the same lattice site @xmath49 .",
    "_ lattice geometry : _ the lattice site positions @xmath60 determine the lattice geometry .",
    "for instance the above arrangement of three pairs of orthogonal laser beams leads to a simple cubic lattice ( shown in fig .  [ lattgeom]a ) .",

    "if the periodicity @xmath71 is incommensurate with @xmath72 and several additional lasers with different periodicity @xmath73 are superimposed to the original lattice the site offsets @xmath74 can be made quasi random over the size of the actual optical lattice .",
    "_ state dependent lattices : _ as already mentioned above the strength of the optical potential crucially depends on the atomic dipole moment between the internal states involved .",
    "thus we can exploit selection rules for optical transitions to create differing traps for different internal states of the atom @xcite .",
    "we will illustrate this by an example that is particularly relevant in what follows .",

    "since these two standing waves act as internal state dependent potentials for the hyperfine states the optical lattice can be moved in opposite directions for different internal hyperfine states .",
    "_ population transfer between hyperfine states : _ two atomic hyperfine levels can be coupled coherently via magnetic dipole moment matrix elements by an additional oscillating microwave field .",
    "alternatively transitions can also be driven by a raman laser setup which consists of two laser beams and couples two hyperfine levels via a far detuned excited state .",
    "in both cases the dynamics is described by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath104 with @xmath105 the rabi frequency , @xmath106 the detuning and @xmath17 , @xmath107 the two coupled atomic states .     between their polarization axes .",
    "the lattice sites for different internal states ( indicated by closed and open circles ) are shifted by @xmath108 . ]      in all of the above calculations we have only considered the coherent interactions of an atom with laser light .",
    "any incoherent scattering processes which lead to spontaneous emission were neglected .",
    "we will now establish the validity of this approximation by estimating the mean rate @xmath109 of spontaneous photon emission from an atom trapped in the lowest vibrational state of the optical lattice .",
    "this rate of spontaneous emission is given by the product of the life time @xmath110 of the excited state and the probability of the atom occupying this state .",
    "in the case of a blue detuned optical lattice ( dark optical lattice ) @xmath111 the potential minima coincide with the points of no light intensity and we find the effective spontaneous emission rate @xmath112 .",
    "if the lattice is red detuned ( bright optical lattice ) @xmath113 the potential minima match the points of maximum light intensity and we find @xmath114",
    ". since @xmath115 the spontaneous emission in a red detuned optical lattice will always be more significant than in a blue lattice , however , as long as @xmath116 spontaneous emission does not play a significant role .",

    "a lattice with depth @xmath54 leads to a trapping frequency of @xmath123 yielding a spontaneous emission rate of @xmath124 while experiments are typically carried out in times shorter than one second .",

    "we consider a gas of interacting particles moving in an optical lattice . starting from the full many body hamiltonian including local two particle interactions",
    "we first give a naive derivation of the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) @xcite and present related models which can be realized in an optical lattice .",
    "then we proceed by discussing adiabatic and irreverisble schemes for loading the lattice with ultracold atoms .",
