    "two kinds of single bunch transverse instability in circular accelerators are distinguished at present : the head - tail one and the transverse mode coupling instability ( tmci ) .",
    "first of them has been studied first by pellegrini @xcite and sands @xcite who were treating the transverse bunch oscillations as a combination of uncoupled multipoles @xmath0 with @xmath1 as synchrotron phase .",
    "role of synchrotron amplitude has been investigated later by sacherer who was introducing the conception of radial modes @xcite .",
    "a lot of papers dealing with this were published later , including reviews and books ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the most important conclusion is that the head - tail instability is possible at non - zero chromaticity only and depends on its sign .",
    "other type of instability was observed in many electron machines regardless of chromaticity and being primary referred as `` transverse turbulence '' .",
    "its first explanation has been proposed by kohaupt who used a simple model of two particles propelling each other through the mediation of constant wake fields @xcite .",
    "later the theory has been evolved on the base of vlasov equation treating the instability as a result of reciprocal influence of neighboring pairs of the head - tail modes which frequencies approach each other due to a wake field , whence the term tmci appears  @xcite .",
    "chromaticity has been ignored in these investigations as a factor of secondary importance .",
    "some space charge effects has been considered later for both head - tail and tmci instabilities @xcite .",
    "however , specific models like the hollow bunch in the square potential well have been used in @xcite , and only high space charge limit was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an important observation is that , in all considered cases , the lowest multipoles @xmath2 or their combinations are the most prone to instability and pose a major threat to the accelerator operation .",
    "it is shown in this paper that the general theory can be essentially simplified and unified being restricted by these cases .",
    "general 3-modes model is developed for this , providing simple analytical formulae for all types of single bunch instability .",
    "the model is built on the base of exact solutions for hollow bunch which are obtained in the paper without any additional assumptions like truncated multipole expansion .",
    "the dangerous modes are separated and extended to realistic distributions with arbitrary wake , chromaticity and space charge included .",
    "it is shown that the instability parameters depend only slightly on the bunch shape being rather sensitive to the wake function form .",
    "resistive wall wake is investigated especially to assign which effect is more dangerous in specific cases : either tmci or collective mode instability .",
    "chromaticity is taken into account in all the cases demonstrating an absence of clearly defined boundary between the head - tail instability ( separated multipoles ) and tmci ( coalesced multipoles ) .",
    "space charge effects are studied with arbitrary ratio of betatron tune shift to synchrotron tune .",
    "in contrast with earlier papers @xcite , the investigation is not restricted by simplified bunch models or by limiting cases only .",
    "it is shown that the space charge effect can be either advantageous or not for the bunch stability , dependent on the wake sign .",
    "linear synchrotron oscillations are considered in this paper being characterized by amplitude @xmath3 and phase @xmath4 , or by corresponding cartesian coordinates : @xmath5 thus @xmath6 is azimuthal deviation of the particle from the bunch center in the rest frame whereas the variable @xmath7 is proportional to the momentum deviation with respect to the central bunch momentum ( proportionality coefficient is not a factor in this paper ) .",
    "steady state of a bunch will be described by the distribution function @xmath8 and by corresponding linear density @xmath9 with the normalization conditions @xmath10 it is convenient to present coherent transverse displacement of the bunch in the point of longitudinal phase space @xmath11 in the form @xcite @xmath12\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the revolution frequency , @xmath14 is the central betatron tune , @xmath15 is an addition due to a wake field , and @xmath16  is the normalized chromaticity : @xmath17 with @xmath18 as usual chromaticity , and @xmath19 as the momentum compaction factor . as it has been shown in ref .",

    "more often than not , this function is negative ( resistive wall wake can be mentioned as the best known example ) .",
    "just such a case was considered in the most of published papers . however , positive wakes are known as well , for example the field created by heavy positive ions in a proton beam @xcite .",
    "it will be shown in sec.vii that the wake sign is especially important when space charge is included in the consideration .",
    "alternating wakes are possible as well ( resonator models @xcite ) but this case is beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "it is assumed in any case that @xmath24 is rather short range function so that the wake field can not reach subsequent bunches or turns .",
    "constant wake @xmath32 will be used to start with , and more general cases will be considered in sec .",
