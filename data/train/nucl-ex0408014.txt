    "among the large set of measurements predicted @xcite to uncover the formation and nature of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , and the corresponding phase transition between this plasma and the more familiar hadronic phase , hanbury brown - twiss interferometry ( hbt ) @xcite surely is the most maligned .",
    "this quark matter conference marks the three - year anniversary of the first presentation of experimental hbt results @xcite from rhic , which showed that the  standard \" hbt source radii in au+au collisions at @xmath0 gev ( introduced below ) are quantitatively similar to previous measurements at both ags and sps .",
    "the ceres collaboration illustrated this nicely in results @xcite presented at the last quark matter .",

    "whether the  hbt puzzle \" continues to be cause for concern in our field remains to be seen , as it has recently taken a back seat to studies that do show strong differences at rhic compared to lower energies ( most notably higher @xmath1 effects attributed to jet quenching @xcite ) .",
    "the puzzle has also been somewhat cast aside as a simple lack of adequate description for the freeze - out process ( most notably at this conference by miklos gyulassy , an early advocate of hbt as phase transition signature @xcite ) . while it is clear that understanding the evolution of the hot , dense , expanding system requires an understanding of its space - time structure accessed by hbt studies , it is not clear to me whether this understanding can be bypassed when making qgp discovery claims based on other observables . in that sense ,",
    "the hbt puzzle still warrants much theoretical and experimental effort , perhaps more than it currently receives .    providing a ray of optimism ,",
    "reinhard stock , in his quark matter introductory overview , characterized hbt as bringing us  from enlightenment to tragedy , and back to enlightenment , on a time scale of four years . \" with these words in mind , in this overview i assess the status of hbt measurements and the persisting puzzle , mostly from an experimentalist s standpoint .",
    "i also discuss new developments in two - particle interferometry that contribute more to our understanding of heavy - ion collisions at relativistic energies .",

    "i wo nt discuss these here except to note that nearly all heavy - ion studies now have adopted an improved coulomb treatment @xcite .",
    "the purpose of hbt studies in heavy - ion collisions is to explore the space - time evolution and freeze - out of the system .",

    "this disagreement , and the lack of energy dependence of the hbt radii for a fixed @xmath15 bin @xcite , is known as the ",
    "hbt puzzle .",
    "\" here i will summarize recent theoretical approaches to resolving the puzzle , illustrating along the way why the data are indeed puzzling .",
    "the first question is whether the hydro calculation itself can be altered to agree better with the hbt radii .",
    "this was explored in great detail by heinz and kolb @xcite .",
    "a summary of their findings :    * _ default initial conditions _",
    ", such that @xmath1 spectra and elliptic flow are well - described , yield the disagreement discussed above .",
    "* _ freeze - out directly at hadronization _ brings @xmath19 and @xmath20 close to the data , but at the cost of large disagreement with @xmath1 spectra .",
    "@xmath21 does nt move , still lacking @xmath15 dependence . *",
    "_ faster thermalization or non - zero initial flow _ also reduces @xmath19 and @xmath20 compared to default conditions , but not enough to agree with measurement .",
    "hirano and tsuda @xcite also checked the effect of maintaining proper particle abundances with chemical potentials in the hadronic phase of hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "they found better agreement for @xmath20 and @xmath19 , but @xmath21 disagreed more .    whether or not hydro can be made to reproduce hbt radii while maintaining the strong agreement with momentum - space quantities might come down to the assumption of longitudinal boost invariance implicit in most hydro approaches .",
    "csorgo has shown @xcite that , by introducing a hubble - like flow and allowing for a smeared freeze - out temperature , the hbt radii ( as well as spectra and elliptic flow ) can be well described by a single parameter set . however , a blast - wave parametrization @xcite which maintains longitudinal boost invariance also was able to fit the data rather well . both of these  hydro - inspired",
    "\" approaches do not contain a full hydrodynamic evolution , but the descriptions of freeze - out obtained by their fits possibly hint at the directions full hydro models should take .",
    "a few alternatives to hydro have been investigated .",
    "studies of the effect of introducing opacity in a parton cascade model @xcite showed that the pion freeze - out distribution is indeed sensitive to the transport opacity in the partonic phase . for a parton cascade with no opacity ,",
    "all three hbt radii show no @xmath15 dependence and values below the data .",
    "as the opacity is increased , @xmath20 and @xmath19 develop @xmath15 dependences and increase toward the data nicely , but @xmath21 does nt move . (",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claim this points to a lack of sensitivity of @xmath21 to early partonic dynamics . )",
    "still , the behavior of @xmath20 and @xmath19 with increasing opacity may indicate that reality lies somewhere between the extremes of cascade and ideal hydro .",
    "finally , a natural consequence of hydro models is a negative @xmath22-@xmath23 correlation , _",
    "i.e. _ pions _ further _ from the source s center are emitted _",
    "@xmath19 depends explicitly on an @xmath24 cross - term , with a negative @xmath24 acting to increase @xmath19 .",
    "however , cascade models such as ampt @xcite have shown that _ positive _ @xmath22-@xmath23 correlations arise naturally in their codes , thereby reducing @xmath19 compared to hydro s overprediction . whether it makes physical sense that particles emitted further from the center could decouple after particles emitted closer to the center is an important question that needs to be confronted by these models .",
    "despite our difficulties to understand what standard pion hbt measurements are telling us at rhic ( and therefore at lower energies , for that matter ) , two - particle interferometry studies have been extended recently into new domains at both sps and rhic . here",
    "i will discuss two examples .",
    "star has recently completed an analysis of the azimuthal dependence of hbt radii relative to the reaction plane at @xmath25 gev @xcite .",
    "azimuthally sensitive hbt was suggested @xcite as a probe of how spatial anisotropy evolves in non - central collisions .",
    "the reasoning is straightforward : ( a ) the initial almond - shaped geometry gives rise to anisotropies in pressure gradients , the same gradients responsible for elliptic flow .",
    "( b ) the pressure gradients drive a preferential expansion in the reaction plane that decreases the spatial anisotropy .",
    "( c ) hbt provides a measure of the freeze - out source shape , which in principle could change its orientation from _ out - of - plane _ to _ in - plane _ extended depending on the amount of pressure built up and the expansion time .",
    "star s results showed an intuitive ( though model - dependent ) centrality dependence of the system s eccentricity at freeze - out ( figure [ fig : two ] ) .    )",
    "vs.  initial eccentricity from a glauber model ( @xmath26 ) in au+au collisions at @xmath27 gev .",
    "the most peripheral collisions correspond to the largest eccentricity .",
    "the dashed line indicates @xmath26 = @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    near - central collisions showed final eccentricities consistent with zero .",
    "when going from central to peripheral collisions , the final eccentricity increased , reflecting the greater initial eccentricity while retaining some of its initial _ out - of - plane _ almond shape . given the strong evidence for significant pressure build - up in the system from elliptic flow measurements , the results point to short evolution times as the dominant cause for out - of - plane freeze - out shapes .",
    "another domain that holds much promise is hbt of direct photons @xcite . unlike pions",
    ", @xmath29-hbt probes the initial state , thereby providing a potential probe of conditions in the deconfined phase .",
    "however it is a major challenge experimentally , due to the low relative direct-@xmath29 yield and the many sources of pairs with small relative momenta . to name a few : photon conversions , decays of @xmath30 s ( which themselves are affected by hbt ) , resonance decays , misidentified @xmath29 s . in spite of the technical challenges , wa98 recently performed @xcite the first @xmath29-hbt measurement in heavy - ion collisions , in a low - momentum range of @xmath31 gev/@xmath18 .",
    "very interestingly , they observed hbt radii quantitatively similar to @xmath32-hbt for the same @xmath1 , which they attributed to soft photons arising in late stages of the collision .    though this was surely already significant enough for a _ phys",
    ".  rev .",
    "_ , wa98 took the analysis a step further , using the @xmath33 parameter from fitting the correlation function ( and assuming a fully chaotic source ) to determine the absolute direct photon yield in this momentum range .",
    "this technique provides a complementary tool to subtraction - based direct-@xmath29 yield measurements , and at higher transverse momenta it holds great promise for accessing the temperature reached at early stages of the collision .",
    "( direct photon studies are underway at rhic . )",
    "one of the advantages of the rhic experimental program is the ability to collide different systems with the same center - of - mass energy , allowing for identical analyses of these different systems .",
    "preliminary results were presented at this conference @xcite of pion hbt in p+p and d+au collisions at @xmath25 gev , for comparison to the centrality - binned au+au analysis ( with fixed particle i d .",
    "cuts , same @xmath15 bins ) . like the heavy - ion case , the three hbt radii in p+p exhibit a characteristic decrease with increasing @xmath15 , though for p+p it has been attributed to string and multistring fragmentation in earlier studies .",
    "a somewhat surprising result comes about when dividing the au+au and d+au radii by the p+p radii @xcite .",
    "the divided trends are roughly flat with @xmath15 for all radii , indicating an apparent scaling in the @xmath15 dependences of the hbt radii for these three systems . given that the @xmath15 dependence presumably arises in very different ways ( collective expansion in heavy ions , string fragmentation in elementary particles ) , these results also are a bit puzzling .",
    "similarity among these systems can be further tested . at the last quark matter conference , ceres proposed @xcite a simple ansatz to investigate if pion freeze - out is driven by a critical mean free path @xmath34 .",
    "they developed an approximate expression for @xmath34 that depends on the freeze - out volume @xmath35 estimated from hbt radii , pion and nucleon particle densities ( @xmath36 ) , and scattering cross sections for these particles ( @xmath37 ) . here",
    "i only give the final expression for @xmath34 ; see their paper @xcite for full development of , and reasoning behind , this expression and its caveats ( such as how the @xmath36 are estimated from the @xmath38 , @xmath20 , and thermal velocity @xmath39 ) : @xmath40 figure [ fig : upfo](a ) shows the numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "[ eq : ceres ] plotted in the same panel vs.  @xmath41 ( from ags to rhic energies ) , with the scale for @xmath35 ( @xmath42 ) defined on the right ( left ) axis .     and the density / cross - section term @xmath42 as a function of @xmath41 for central heavy - ion collisions .",
    "( b ) the same quantities calculated for p+p and d+au at @xmath27 gev , plotted on the same relative scale ; circles ( @xmath43 ) are @xmath42 , stars ( @xmath44 ) are @xmath35.,title=\"fig:\",width=480 ]    both trends exhibit non - monotonic behaviors with dips in between ags and sps energies that match impressively for the given scales .",
    "@xmath35 decreases at ags energies mostly due to decreasing @xmath21 and increases from sps to rhic due to increasing @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath42 expression first decreases and then increases , reflecting the transition between nucleon and pion dominance as the chemical composition changes with increasing @xmath41 .",
    "the agreement between the trends yields a critical mean free path of @xmath45 fm across the energy range , which the authors attribute to significant opaqueness in the source @xcite .    using the hbt radii for p+p and d+au presented at this conference and published @xmath46 values from star @xcite , the critical mean",
    "free path ansatz can be applied to these systems .",
    "figure [ fig : upfo](b ) shows the incredible result that @xmath34 is @xmath45 fm for these light systems as well , even though @xmath35 and @xmath42 are lower by two orders of magnitude .",
    "i find this really incredible",
    ". why would these systems exhibit such similar mean free paths at freeze - out in this simple ansatz ?",
    "is it only a coincidence , for example that @xmath34 is reflecting the considerable opaqueness in au+au but merely the system size in p+p and d+au ? or has ceres touched upon a deeper connection between the freeze - out volume and freeze - out density that is somehow independent of the actual dynamics in the system ?",
    "the status of hbt interferometry as a signature for the formation of a quark - gluon plasma or the corresponding phase transition remains murky .",
    "this murkiness is due mostly to the persisting disagreement between @xmath32-hbt data and most hydrodynamical models that obtain good agreement with transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow , as well as hbt s intrinsic sensitivity to the latest stages of the collision . after discussing the hbt puzzle _ ad infinitum",
    "_ with many experts before and during this conference , i am of the opinion that there are primarily two candidate solutions : ( a ) the growing evidence for a lack of longitudinal boost invariance at rhic suggests that alternative hydro formulations need to be explored further ; ( b ) parton cascade studies that are able to get close to the hbt data with finite opacity might indicate that , contrary to popular belief , perhaps the hydrodynamic ",
    "limit \" has not been reached at rhic .",
    "both statements illustrate the importance of hbt in understanding heavy - ion collisions .    however , a number of recent developments have shed light on hbt s ability to unlock information about the nature of the collisions we study .",
    "azimuthally - sensitive hbt measurements of non - central collisions indicate that the system retains some of its initial almond shape at the end of its evolution , supporting the notion that the system lives shorter than predicted .",
    "first observation of direct photon hbt at sps energies illustrates the potential for @xmath29-hbt to probe early conditions in the collision .",
    "identical experimental conditions and analysis methods for p+p and au+au at rhic provide an important link between these two systems with presumably very different dynamics .",
    "the larger au+au dataset taken this year at rhic also holds the potential for exotic correlation studies between non - identical particles , further and more differential measurements of  standard \" hbt extended to higher transverse momenta , and maybe even studies of the quark gluon plasma using hbt of direct photons .",
    "though hbt interferometry has been troublesome to many of us in the first years of rhic running , its future contributions to our understanding of relativistic heavy - ion collisions are assured .",
