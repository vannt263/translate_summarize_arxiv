    "one of the fundamental results of minimal surface theory is rado s theorem , which is connected to the famous plateau problem .",
    "rado s theorem ( see @xcite ) states that if @xmath0 is a convex subset and @xmath1 is a simple closed curve which is graphical over @xmath2 , then any minimal surface @xmath3 with @xmath4 must be a disk which is graphical over @xmath5 , and hence unique by the maximum principle .",
    "the proof of rado s theorem begins by assuming there is a point at which @xmath6 is not graphical , i.e. , where @xmath6 has a vertical tangent plane .",
    "one can then use the description of the local intersection of minimal surfaces as @xmath7-prong singularities ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ? * section 4.6 ) ) to derive a contradiction of the assumption on the boundary @xmath8 .",
    "our goal is to generalize rado s theorem for the case in which @xmath8 is not graphical , but satisfies some `` almost graphical '' condition .",
    "we will show that , although @xmath6 is obviously not graphical near its boundary , if we move far enough in from the boundary , @xmath6 will be graphical .",
    "we will prove the genus zero case first , and then generalize to higher genus surfaces .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will use the topological fact that , if @xmath6 has genus @xmath7 , any collection of @xmath9 disjoint closed simple curves on @xmath6 must separate @xmath6 into at least two connected components .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "if a compact connected orientable surface with boundary of genus @xmath7 has @xmath10 boundary components , its euler characteristic is @xmath11 . by cutting the surface along a circle which does not separate the surface into at least two connected components ,",
    "the number of boundary components would increase by two , while the euler characteristic would stay the same .",
    "thus , the genus would decrease by one .",
    "therefore , the maximum number of such cuts would be equal to the genus @xmath7 , so any collection of @xmath9 disjoint closed simple curves must separate the surface into at least two connected components .    the `` almost graphical '' condition we will use will be as follows .",
    "let @xmath12 be a parametrization for @xmath13 .",

    "although the proof of rado s theorem utilizes intersections of minimal surfaces with planes ( namely , vertical tangent planes ) , the proof of our generalization will require a greater degree of sophistication .",
