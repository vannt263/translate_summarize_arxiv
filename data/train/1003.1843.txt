    "kleinian groups have been studied since the late @xmath2 century in the work of poincar and fricke and klein , and more extensively since the work of ahlfors and bers in the 1960s and thurston in the 1970s and 1980s . in this paper",
    ", we consider a particular aspect of the basic question of understanding the behavior of sequences of kleinian groups .",
    "there are two standard notions of convergence for a sequence of kleinian groups .",
    "the first is algebraic convergence , which is convergence on generators .",
    "the second is geometric convergence , which is convergence of the quotient hyperbolic 3-manifolds .",
    "the topology of algebraic convergence of the set of isomorphic , finitely generated kleinian groups is well understood .",
    "in particular , there is a correspondence between connected components of this set of kleinian groups and marked homotopy classes of compact 3-manifolds , up to a natural equivalence .",
    "geometric convergence is considerably less well - behaved , as isomorphic , finitely generated kleinian groups may converge geometrically to an infinitely generated kleinian group .",
    "strong convergence of kleinian groups combines these two different notions , so that a sequence of kleinian groups converges strongly to a kleinian group if it converges to that kleinian group both algebraically and geometrically .",
    "thurston proposed a picture of what the space of kleinian groups with the strong topology looks like , which we consider here .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact , orientable , hyperbolizable @xmath3-manifold with incompressible boundary .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the set of discrete faithful representations @xmath5 equipped with the topology of algebraic convergence ( formal definitions are given in section [ background ] ) .",
    "the group @xmath6 of orientation - preserving isometries of hyperbolic 3-space acts on @xmath4 by conjugation .",
    "we denote the quotient by @xmath7 .",
    "note that a sequence @xmath8 \\}\\subset { \\rm ah}(\\pi_1(m))$ ] converges to @xmath9\\in { \\rm ah}(\\pi_1(m))$ ] if there is a sequence @xmath10 so that @xmath11 converges to @xmath12 in @xmath4 .",
    "when there is no possibility of confusion , we refer to elements of both @xmath4 and @xmath7 as representations , even though the elements of the latter set are formally equivalence classes of representations .    by considering the quotient manifold",
    "@xmath13 corresponding to a representation @xmath12 , we can identify @xmath7 with the set of hyperbolic 3-manifolds homotopy equivalent to @xmath1 up to isometry , where the homotopy equivalence induces the given representation .",
    "a sequence @xmath14 in @xmath7 converges strongly to a representation @xmath15 if @xmath14 converges to @xmath15 algebraically and if @xmath16 converges geometrically to @xmath17 .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the set @xmath7 equipped with the strong topology .",
    "though we do not use this description , one can identify @xmath0 with the space of hyperbolic manifolds homotopy equivalent to @xmath1 ( up to isometry ) equipped with a marked pointed hausdorff - gromov topology .",
    "+ by bonahon , see @xcite , each representation @xmath18 is tame , namely the corresponding quotient manifold @xmath13 is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact @xmath3-manifold . combining this result with the uniqueness of the compact core , see @xcite , it follows that the topology of the quotient manifold does not change under strong convergence ( compare with @xcite ) .",
    "namely if @xmath14 converges strongly to @xmath15 , then @xmath19 is homeomorphic to @xmath20 for @xmath21 sufficiently large . using the ending lamination theorem ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite , and thurston s double limit theorem , see @xcite , one can then see that the connected components of @xmath0 are in @xmath22-to-@xmath22 correspondence with the set of marked homeomorphism types of @xmath3-manifolds homotopy equivalent to @xmath1 ( we see that this fact can be deduced from our results as well ) .",
    "in particular , as a first point of contrast with @xmath7 , we show that @xmath0 does not have the bumping phenomenon described for @xmath7 for many @xmath1 in @xcite .",
    "+ in addition to the existence of bumping , another disturbing property of @xmath7 is that it may not even be locally connected , see @xcite .",

    "the reason why self - bumping points may be present in @xmath7 and not in @xmath0 is that some sequences of representations that converge in @xmath7 do not converge in @xmath0 .",

    "we put on the set of gallimaufries a topology that extends the usual topology of the teichmller space .",
    "we say that the gallimaufry @xmath42 is _ doubly incompressible _ if there is a transverse measure @xmath47 supported by @xmath46 and @xmath48 such that for any essential annulus or mbius band @xmath49 we have @xmath50 .",

    "we show that given a sequence of representations whose end invariants converge to a doubly incompressible gallimaufry , a sub - sequence converges algebraically .",

    "<S> we use these coordinates to show the local connectivity of @xmath0 and study the action of the modular group of @xmath1 on @xmath0 . </S>"
