    "in recent years one has witnessed an extensive investigation of quantum phase transition in low - dimensional @xmath3 heisenberg antiferromagnets ( qhaf ) as a function of doping , magnetic field and disorder@xcite .",
    "for example , two - dimensional qhaf ( 2dqhaf ) have been widely studied in order to evidence a phase transition from the renormalized classical to the quantum disordered regime upon charge doping @xcite .",
    "another possibility to drive quantum phase transitions in a 2dqhaf is to induce a sizeable frustration . in particular , for a square lattice with an exchange coupling along the diagonal @xmath5 about half of the one along the sides of the square @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , a crossover to a spin - liquid ground state is expected @xcite . for @xmath12 nel order",
    "is realized , while for @xmath13 a collinear order should develop .",
    "the collinear order ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , which can be considered as formed by two interpenetrating nel sublattices with staggered magnetization @xmath14 and @xmath15 , is characterized by an ising order parameter @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the two values of @xmath17 correspond to the two collinear configurations which can develop at low temperature ( hereafter @xmath18 ) , one with spins ferromagnetically aligned along the @xmath19 axis , corresponding to a magnetic wave - vector @xmath20 , the other with spins ferromagnetically aligned along the @xmath21 axis ( @xmath22 ) . at a certain temperature @xmath9",
    "a phase transition occurs and the system choses among the @xmath19 or @xmath21 collinear configurations .",
    "the precise boundaries of the @xmath23 phase diagram for a frustrated 2dqhaf are unknown and could be modified by the presence of a finite third neighbour coupling @xcite .",
    "most of these theoretical predictions have not found an experimental support so far , mainly due to the absence of systems which can be regarded as prototypes of frustrated 2dqhaf on a square lattice with @xmath5 close to @xmath4 , even if some frustrated 2dqhaf with different topologies have been recently studied @xcite .",
    "moreover , a theoretical description of the spin dynamics of these frustrated 2dqhaf as a function of @xmath18 and magnetic field intensity is still missing .",
    "recently , two vanadates which can be considered as prototypes of frustrated 2dqhaf on a square lattice have been discovered @xcite : li@xmath1vosio@xmath2 and li@xmath1vogeo@xmath2 .",
    "these two isostructural compounds are characterized by a layered structure containing v@xmath24 ( @xmath3 ) ions @xcite ( see fig .",
    "the structure of @xmath25 layers suggests that the superexchange couplings between first and second neighbours are similar .",
    "it is however difficult a priori to decide which one should dominate : first neighbours are connected by two superexchange channels , but they are located in pyramids looking in opposite directions and are not exactly in the same plane , whereas second neighbours are connected by one channel , but are located in pyramids looking in the same directions and are in the same plane .",
    "on the basis of nmr and susceptibility it has been possible to demonstrate that in li@xmath1vosio@xmath2 @xmath23 is of the order of unity and that the ground state is collinear @xcite , as expected for @xmath26@xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed study of the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of li@xmath1vosio@xmath2 by means of nmr , @xmath0sr , magnetization and specific heat measurements .",
    "in particular , we show that the spin dynamic and static properties above the collinear ordering temperature @xmath9 are consistent with the ones theoretically predicted for a frustrated 2dqhaf with @xmath27 .",
    "the phase transition to the collinear phase seems to be triggered by a structural distortion occuring just above @xmath9 , which possibly modifies the superexchange couplings and lifts the degeneracy among the two ground state configurations .",
    "the critical exponent of the sublattice magnetization and the independence of @xmath9 on the magnetic field intensity up to @xmath10 tesla , suggest that the transition is driven by the xy anisotropy .",
    "the paper is organized as folows : in section ii we present the experimental results obtained by each technique ; in section iii we discuss the experimental results in the light of numerical and analytical results for frustrated 2dqhaf on a square lattice , first for @xmath28 and then for @xmath29 ; the main conclusions are summarized in section iv .",
    "li@xmath1vosio@xmath2 was prepared by solid state reaction starting from a stoechiometric mixture of li@xmath1sio@xmath30 , v@xmath1o@xmath30 and v@xmath1o@xmath31 according to the procedure described in ref .",
    "the sample was analyzed by x - ray powder diffraction ( xrd ) using a seifert c3000 diffractometer with cuk@xmath32 radiation and then pressed into a @xmath33 g pellet followed by a short sintering in vacuum at @xmath34 c for @xmath35 hours .",
    "single crystals , of average size @xmath36 mm@xmath37 , were obtained from li@xmath1vosio@xmath2 powder heated at @xmath38 c for @xmath39 hours , slowly cooled at a rate of @xmath40 c / hour down to @xmath41 c and then furnace cooled down to room temperature .",
    "specific heat ( @xmath42 ) measurements have been performed on a sintered pellet of li@xmath1vosio@xmath2 by using a standard homemade adiabatic calorimeter .",
    "the contribution of the addenda decreased from about 5% to below 1% of the total heat capacity on decreasing @xmath18 from 25 k to 2.5 k. at low @xmath18 the specific heat shows a broad maximum due to the correlated spin excitations and a sharp peak around @xmath43 k ( see fig .",
    "2a ) associated with a second order phase transition , as can be inferred from the non - singular behaviour of the entropy around @xmath43 k. above 20 k a rapid increase , originating from phonon excitations is observed ( see fig .",
    "in order to accurately estimate the magnetic contribution @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "2b ) to the specific heat one has to subtract the phonon term @xmath45 , extrapolated to low @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath45 was observed to follow a debye law from 20 to 70 k , namely @xmath46 with @xmath47 k the debye temperature .",
    "it must be stressed that below @xmath48 k @xmath45 is negligible with respect to @xmath44 , therefore , any incorrect extrapolation of @xmath45 to low @xmath18 will not affect the estimate of @xmath44 below @xmath48 k.    magnetization measurements were carried out with a quantum design mpms - xl7 squid magnetometer , both on powders and on single crystals .",
    "the @xmath18 dependence of the spin susceptibility @xmath49 is shown in fig .",
    "3 . one observes a high @xmath18 curie - like behaviour , a low @xmath18 maximum around 5 k and a kink at @xmath8 k , the same temperature where a peak in the specific heat is detected .",
    "the kink is better evidenced if one reports the derivative of the susceptibility @xmath50 ( see the upper inset to fig .",
    "3 ) . the susceptibility above @xmath48 k can be appropriately fitted by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the curie - weiss temperature , @xmath53 ( @xmath54 the land factor and @xmath55 the bohr magneton ) is the curie constant and @xmath56 the van - vleck term .",
    "the best fit of the data in the @xmath18 range 10 - 300 k yields @xmath57 k @xcite , @xmath58 emu k / mole and @xmath59 emu / mole .",
    "we point out that the value of @xmath60 is in good quantitative agreement with what one would expect for an @xmath3 paramagnet , while the absolute value of @xmath56 is consistent with a separation between the @xmath61 ground state and the first excited @xmath62 levels of the order of @xmath63 ev , which is typical for v@xmath24 in a pyramidal environment @xcite . below @xmath9 the @xmath18 dependence of the susceptibility for magnetic fields @xmath64 and @xmath65 is different , as expected in the presence of long range order .",
    "in particular , one observes that while for @xmath65 the susceptibility progressively diminishes on decreasing temperature , for @xmath64 it flattens ( see the lower inset to fig .",
    "3 ) , suggesting that v@xmath24 magnetic moments lie in the @xmath66 plane .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of @xmath9 , derived either from the kink in the susceptibility or from the maximum in @xmath50 , was measured from @xmath67 up to @xmath68 tesla , where the zeeman energy @xmath69 is greater than @xmath70 , and , remarkably , @xmath9 was not observed to vary by more than @xmath71 k , i.e. less than @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "zero field ( zf ) @xmath0sr measurements have been carried out on li@xmath1vosio@xmath2 powders at isis pulsed source , both on emu and musr beamlines , using spin - polarized @xmath73 mev / c muons .",
    "the time evolution of the muon polarization is characterized by a constant background , due to the sample holder and cryostat walls , and by a fast decay which progressively changes from exponential ( see fig .",
    "5 ) to gaussian on increasing temperature , for @xmath74 . below @xmath9 both oscillating and non - oscillating components are evident , the second one with an amplitude about half of the former one , as usually expected in magnetic powders with equivalent muon sites @xcite .",
    "it must be mentioned that below @xmath9 around 10% of the total asymmetry is missing , possibly due to fast precessing muons which can not be detected at a pulsed muon source . summarizing , below @xmath9 the time evolution of the muon polarization was fitted according to @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the sample holder background , @xmath77 is the amplitude of the oscillating component , with @xmath78 mhz / tesla the @xmath79 gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath80 the local field at the @xmath79 , while @xmath81 is the ampltude of the non - oscillating component with @xmath82 the longitudinal decay rate .",
    "above @xmath9 the polarization was fitted by @xmath83 where the exponential term is the relaxation induced by the progressive slowing down of the v@xmath24 spin fluctuations on decreasing temperature , while the gaussian term should originate from nuclear dipolar interaction .",
    "in particular , it is likely that @xmath79 localizes close to the apical oxygens , where it is coupled to @xmath84li nuclear magnetic moments . the gaussian relaxation rate was estimated @xmath85 @xmath86 , for @xmath87 k , a value typical for relaxation driven by nuclear dipole interaction @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 dependence of the local field at the muon @xmath80 and of the longitudinal relaxation rate @xmath82 , derived after the fit of the data with eqs . 3 and 4 ,",
    "are reported in figs . 6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "@xmath88 , which yields the @xmath18 dependence of v@xmath24 average magnetic moment , is characterized by a sharp but continuous decrease on approaching @xmath9 , while @xmath89 is characterized by a divergence at @xmath9 , as expected for a second order phase transition .",
    "@xmath84li ( @xmath91 ) nmr measurements have been carried out both on single crystals and powders , while @xmath90si ( @xmath92 ) nmr , due to the reduced sensitivity could be performed only in powder samples .",
    "the measurements have been performed using standard nmr pulse sequences . in particular , the spectra have been recorded by fourier transform of half of the echo signal when the line was completely irradiated or by summing spectra recorded at different frequencies when it was only partially irradiated .",
    "the nmr resonance frequency of @xmath84li was observed to shift to high frequencies on decreasing temperature , with a trend identical to the one of the macroscopic susceptibility ( fig.3 ) .",
    "in fact , for @xmath84li nmr shift one can write @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the hyperfine coupling tensor with the @xmath95-th v@xmath24 and @xmath96 the chemical shift . a @xmath18 dependent shift was observed both in the single crystals and in the powders , evidencing a sizeable transferred hyperfine interaction of v@xmath24 spins with @xmath84li nuclei . from the plot of the shift versus the susceptibility ( fig . 8)",
    "the hyperfine coupling constants and the chemical shift were determined .",
    "it turns out that @xmath97 ppm and that the hyperfine field at @xmath84li is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the dipolar coupling with v@xmath24 ions , while @xmath100 gauss is the transferred coupling , which is supposed to arise from the two v@xmath24 nearest neighbours only . on the other hand , @xmath90si nmr resonance frequency in the powders",
    "is constant from room temperature down to 4 k , pointing out that the hyperfine coupling is of purely dipolar origin in this case .    below @xmath9 , in the single crystals , for @xmath64 , @xmath84li nmr spectrum splits in three lines ( see fig .",
    "9 ) : a central one with an intensity about twice of that of two equally spaced satellites .",
    "the two satellites correspond to @xmath84li sites with hyperfine fields of equal intensity but opposite orientations , while the central line corresponds to @xmath84li sites where the hyperfine field cancels out @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 dependence of the satellites shift is proportional to the amplitude of v@xmath24 magnetic moment and , therefore , it is another method , besides zf @xmath0sr , to determine the temperature dependence of the sublattice magnetization ( see fig . 10 ) .",
    "@xmath90si nmr powder spectrum shows a quite different behaviour at low t. around @xmath101 k , still above @xmath9 , one observes the appearence of a shifted narrow peak ( see fig .",
    "11 ) . on decreasing @xmath18",
    "the low - frequency peak progressively disappears , while the intensity of the high frequency one increases .",
    "this jump in @xmath90si nmr shift has to be associated either with a modification of the chemical shift or of the hyperfine coupling , suggesting the occurrence of a structural distortion just above @xmath9 .",
    "it has to be noticed that , on the contrary , no anomaly was detected in @xmath84li spectra around @xmath101 k. below @xmath9 @xmath90si nmr linewidth is very close to the one above @xmath9 , indicating that the local field at @xmath90si site is zero .",
    "nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath102 was measured by exciting the nuclear magnetization either with a comb of saturating pulses or with a @xmath103 pulse ( inversion recovery sequence ) . both for @xmath84li and @xmath90si",
    "the recovery of nuclear magnetization towards equilibrium was a single exponential , indicating that for @xmath84li also the @xmath104 lines were sizeably irradiated during the measurements .",
    "in fact , at room temperature one can discern the @xmath104 lines shifted by @xmath105 khz from the @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath84li @xmath102 is shown in fig .",
    "one observes that @xmath102 is constant from room temperature down to @xmath107 k , then shows a peak at @xmath9 and rapidly decreases in the ordered phase .",
    "@xmath90si @xmath102 shows a similar t dependence below @xmath108 k ( fig .",
    "13 ) , its absolute value , however , is about two orders of magnitude smaller , supporting the conclusion in favour of a hyperfine coupling of purely dipolar origin .",
    "the @xmath18 dependence of the susceptibility and of the specific heat allows to derive information on the basic parameters of the electron spin hamiltonian , namely the coupling constants and their ratio @xmath23 . for a non -",
    "frustrated @xmath3 2d heisenberg af on a square lattice the curie - weiss temperature @xmath109 nearly coincides with the temperature where the susceptibility displays a maximum and one has @xmath110 @xcite . on the other hand , in li@xmath1vosio@xmath2",
    "@xmath111 k is significantly larger than @xmath112 k ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , as expected for a frustrated system . by comparing the measured ratio @xmath113 with exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo ( qmc )",
    "results it is possible to estimate @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that @xmath23 is close either to @xmath114 or @xmath115 @xcite , however , it is not possible to say which of the two coupling constants is larger .",
    "we remark that these two values were estimated by assuming @xmath116 k , however , taking into account the uncertainty of @xmath117 k in the estimate of curie - weiss temperature and that exact diagonalizations provide useful estimates for @xmath118 , while qmc simulations only for @xmath119 @xcite , it is difficult to assign an error bar to these estimates of @xmath23 .    a more accurate determination of the ratio @xmath23 can be done by analyzing @xmath44 data in the light of diagonalization results by singh and narayanan @xcite and of the numerical calculations by bacci et al . @xcite . from the numerical results reported in refs .",
    "15 and 16 it is possible to plot the amplitude of the specific heat at the maximum @xmath120 as a function of the ratio @xmath23 ( fig . 14a ) .",
    "it turns out that the value @xmath121 found for li@xmath1vosio@xmath2 ( @xmath122 ) ( see fig .",
    "2 ) is compatible only with @xmath123 or @xmath124 ( fig .",
    "to discriminate among the two ratios one can analyze how @xmath125 k varies as a function of @xmath23 . since @xmath126 with @xmath127 , one can check which value of @xmath23 is compatible with the results of @xmath128 vs. @xmath23 reported by singh and narayanan @xcite ( see fig .",
    "one observes that eq .",
    "7 is satisfied only for @xmath23 around @xmath67 or @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , the only solution which is compatible with the experimental values both of @xmath130 and @xmath131 is @xmath6 .",
    "this also indicates that @xmath52 is close to @xmath10 k ( see fig .",
    "14b ) and that @xmath132 .",
    "now , by assuming this value for @xmath133 one would derive from the analysis of the susceptiblity a value @xmath134 , in agreement with the specific heat analysis , even if an accurate estimate with qmc is prevented , since in this range of @xmath23 the results start to suffer from the minus sign problem .",
    "a value of @xmath23 around @xmath129 also implies that li@xmath1vosio@xmath2 lies on the right hand side of the phase diagram reported in fig .",
    "1a , where the ground state is expected to be a collinear phase , in complete agreement with nmr results below @xmath9 ( see later on ) .",
    "further information on the superexchange constants can be achieved from the analysis of @xmath84li @xmath102 . in the limit @xmath135",
    ", @xmath102 is constant ( see fig . 12 ) and , by resorting to the usual gaussian form for the decay of the spin correlation function , one can write @xcite @xmath136 with @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) the components of the hyperfine tensor due to the @xmath139 v@xmath24 and @xmath140 the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "@xmath141 is the heisenberg exchange frequency , where @xmath142 is the number of nearest neighbour spins of a v@xmath24 coupled either through @xmath4 or @xmath5 . by using in eq .",
    "8 @xmath143 ms@xmath144 , i.e. @xmath84li relaxation rate in the @xmath18 range @xmath145 @xmath146 @xmath147 k , one finds @xmath148 k , close to what one would derive from susceptibility and specific heat measurements .    on decreasing",
    "temperature @xmath84li and @xmath90si @xmath102 remain constant down to @xmath147 k , at variance with @xmath79 @xmath102 ( usually called @xmath82 ) , which diverges on decreasing t , already at @xmath108 k , due to the growth of the af correlations . both for nuclei and @xmath79 the spin - lattice relaxation",
    "is induced by the fluctuations of the effective local field , driven by the correlated spin dynamics , and one can write @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the hyperfine form factor and @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) are the components of the dynamical structure factor at the nmr or @xmath0sr resonance frequency .",
    "one immediately realizes that a different trend of nmr and @xmath0sr @xmath102 can originate from the different form factors , which couple each one of these probes in a different way with the spin excitations at the critical wave - vector .",
    "in particular , one might suspect that @xmath84li and @xmath90si form factors filter out the af correlated spin excitations . however , if one considers that @xmath84li is coupled via a transferred hyperfine interaction with v@xmath24 nearest neighbours ( see eq .",
    "6 ) , one finds that @xmath84li form factor is little @xmath153-dependent and that no filtering of the af excitations can be envisaged .",
    "moreover , the divergence of @xmath84li and @xmath90si @xmath102 at @xmath9 evidences that the fluctuations at the critical wave vectors can not be completely filtered out .",
    "another relevant difference is still present between @xmath0sr and nmr measurements .",
    "while the former were performed in zero field , nmr @xmath102 measurements were carried out in magnetic fields ranging from @xmath154 to @xmath10 tesla , at which the zeeman energy is comparable to the superexchange couplings .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to associate the different behaviour of nmr and @xmath0sr spin - lattice relaxation rates above @xmath9 to a crossover of regime induced by the magnetic field . in particular , the @xmath18 independent @xmath155 measured in nmr would be consistent with a quantum critical regime @xcite , while the exponential divergence of @xmath102 ( @xmath82 ) measured with @xmath0sr would be consistent with a renormalized classical regime @xcite , where , by resorting to classical scaling arguments for 2d systems , one can write @xcite @xmath156\\ ] ] with @xmath157 the in - plane correlation length , @xmath158 the lattice step and @xmath159 the spin stiffness .",
    "from the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath82 ( see fig .",
    "7 ) above @xmath9 one derives @xmath160 k , less than the value @xmath161 expected for a non - frustrated system @xcite .      since v@xmath24 magnetic moments lie in the @xmath66 plane , as suggested by susceptibility measurements ( fig .",
    "3 ) and by the epr analysis of the @xmath54 tensor @xcite , and provided that the dipolar magnetic field cancels at @xmath90si site , one realizes that the order must be collinear with a critical wave vector @xmath162 , where @xmath19 is the direction of the magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "the second order transition to the low @xmath18 collinear phase is evidenced by the peaks in @xmath102 and in @xmath50 .",
    "it is remarkable to observe that @xmath9 is practically field independent up to at least @xmath10 tesla ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , where @xmath163 , while a decrease is expected , with @xmath9 vanishing for @xmath164 , if @xmath27 , i.e. at @xmath165 tesla @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for this peculiar behaviour is that the structural distortion occuring just above @xmath9 , deduced from @xmath90si nmr spectra , causes an increase in the coupling constants and that even at @xmath10 tesla @xmath166 .",
    "another possibility is that li@xmath1vosio@xmath2 is a 2d xy system with @xmath9 close to the corresponding berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite .",
    "also the @xmath18 dependence of the sublattice magnetization , derived either from the local field at the muon or from the splitting of @xmath84li nmr line , was found independent on the magnetic field intensity from zero up to @xmath10 tesla . from zf@xmath0sr measurements it has been possible to derive a critical exponent @xmath167 for the sublattice magnetization ( see fig .",
    "remarkably , this value of @xmath168 is very close to the one predicted for a 2d xy model on a finite size @xcite .",
    "although some in - plane anisotropy can be discerned from the susceptibility data just above @xmath9 ( see the inset to fig .",
    "3 ) , there is no evidence of a crossover from heisenberg to xy in the @xmath18 dependence of the correlation length , derived from @xmath169 above @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that the sublattice magnetization measured by means of @xmath0sr shows a slight high @xmath18 tail , as expected in a finite size system @xcite .",
    "if the order is purely 2d , without long range order along the @xmath170 axis , one would expect @xmath84li nuclei , which lie between v@xmath24 layers , to be characterized by a broad powder - like nmr spectrum .",
    "this is certainly not the case for @xmath171 k ( see fig .",
    "9 ) , however one can not exclude from the nmr measurements that the order is 2d in the very vicinity of @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , since the strong in - plane xy correlations enhance the 3d coupling the difference between the 2dxy and 3d ordering temperatures is expected to be small , of the order of the interlayer coupling @xmath172 @xcite . an upper limit for @xmath172 can be estimated by assuming that @xmath9 is the 3d ordering temperature of a heisenberg af , where @xmath173 @xcite . from the temperature dependence of @xmath79 relaxation rate @xmath82 ( see eq .",
    "10 ) one finds @xmath174 , leading to @xmath175 k. this value is possibly overestimated and difficult to justify if one considers the chemical bondings in li@xmath1vosio@xmath2 structure .",
    "therefore , a purely 2d order should be observable only for @xmath176 k.    although the nature of this phase transition remains to be clarified , one can argue that the insensitivity both of the nel temperature and of the critical exponent of the sublattice magnetization to the magnetic field indicates that the phase transition is driven by the xy anisotropy .",
    "in 3d magnets with two or more possible pitch vectors @xmath177 , the ordering usually corresponds to a choice of pitch vector .",
    "the situation is often more complicated at lower temperature , and further transitions corresponding to other combinations of the pitch vectors or to the appearance of higher harmonics have been reported .",
    "besides , the relevant parameter for the nature of the transition is the product @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the number of components of the order parameter ( 3 for heisenberg ) and @xmath180 is the number of equivalent wave - vectors@xcite . as a consequence , the resulting transition can have a large critical exponent @xmath168 , typically around 0.4 , or might in some cases be discontinuous .",
    "the results reported in the present paper suggest that the transition is split into two transitions : first a structural transition , as revealed by si nmr , then an ordering transition , as seen at the li site . a natural question arises as to whether the ising degree of freedom corresponding to the two possible collinear states is associated with the structural distortion or with the magnetic ordering .",
    "we believe that the first possibility is the most likely both on experimental and theoretical grounds .",
    "experimentally , the small value of the exponent @xmath168 is typical of layered magnets with xy symmetry .",
    "if the parameter @xmath181 was increased by a factor 2 with respect to the number of components of the order parameter due to the ising degree of freedom , one would not expect to observe such a small exponent .",
    "besides , the choice of a pitch vector for the collinear phase renders the two directions inequivalent , and this is likely to be coupled to the lattice and to be associated with a structural distortion .",
    "one has to notice that the structural distortion occuring just above @xmath9 may have modified the spin hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , a discussion of the properties of the ordered phase on the basis of the parameters extracted above @xmath9 could be misleading . nevertheless , one has to notice that , to be consistent with a collinear order , @xmath23 must be larger than @xmath182 also below @xmath9 .",
    "information on the coupling constants below @xmath9 can be derived from the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath84li nuclear spin - lattice relaxation . below @xmath9 @xmath84li @xmath102",
    "is mainly driven by two - magnon raman processes @xcite , leading to a @xmath183 @xmath18 dependence for @xmath184 , the gap in the spin - wave spectrum , and to @xmath185 for @xmath186 .",
    "the low @xmath18 dependence of @xmath84li @xmath102 turns out to be activated and , by fitting the data for @xmath187 k with the latter expression , one finds @xmath188 k @xcite .",
    "this value of the spin - wave gap is quite large if compared to the value of @xmath189 , estimated from susceptibility measurements above @xmath9 , and would imply an axial anisotropy @xmath190 k ( @xmath191 ) , which is quite large for v@xmath24 .",
    "in fact , the values of the @xmath54 factor estimated from esr measurements are very close to @xmath39 and yield a value of @xmath192 k @xcite . moreover , if @xmath193 li@xmath1vosio@xmath2 should behave as an ising system , not as an xy or heisenberg one , in sharp contrast to the experimental findings .",
    "thus , one is tempted to argue that the low @xmath18 collinear phase is characterized by coupling constants slightly larger than the ones determined above @xmath9 , so that @xmath194 and its absolute value is smaller .    finally , one has to expect that frustration also causes a reduction of the staggered magnetization due to the enhancement of quantum fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath195 average magnetic moment of v@xmath24 ions can be obtained from @xmath84li nmr spectra below @xmath9 . by extrapolatimg to @xmath195 the splitting of @xmath84li nmr satellites and taking into account the hyperfine couplings given by eq .",

    "in conclusion , it has been shown that li@xmath1vosio@xmath2 is a prototype of a frustrated 2dqhaf on a squre lattice with @xmath199 and @xmath200 k. its ground state is a collinear phase , as expected for @xmath13 .",
    "the phase diagram as a function of the magnetic field intensity is characterized by a constant @xmath201 , for @xmath202 tesla .",
    "this observation , together with the fact that the critical exponent of the magnetization @xmath11 , suggest that the transition to the collinear phase is driven by the xy anisotropy .",
    "the structural distortion occurring just above @xmath9 , is expected to lift the degeneracy between the two collinear ground states and to modify the superexchange couplings . in order to gain further insights on the nature of the phase transition and on the effective coupling constants below @xmath9 further measurements with other techniques ( e.g. inelastic neutron scattering )",

    "on the basis of a point charge approximation one derives an electric field gradient tensor at @xmath84li nuclei with its main axis tilted by @xmath105 degrees from the @xmath170 axis and a quadrupolar frequency of @xmath208 khz , yielding a shift of @xmath209 resonance frequency from the central resonance of @xmath210 khz , close to the one experimentally observed .",
