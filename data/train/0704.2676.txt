    "heavy flavor physics at the tevatron exploits the large @xmath3 production cross section and the fact that , unlike at the @xmath4-factories , all species of b hadrons are produced .",
    "there are also several challenges , mainly due to the huge total inelastic cross section and to the abundance of combinatorical background .",
    "the analyses described below became possible thanks to the high performances of the cdf and d  detectors .",
    "cdf has an excellent mass resolution and the unique ability to trigger events with charged particles originated in vertices displaced from the primary @xmath5 vertex ( displaced tracks ) .",
    "the particle identification , with both the time - of - flight detector and @xmath6 from the drift chamber , is crucial .",
    "d  uses its superb muon system : large @xmath7 coverage , good scintillator based triggering and cosmic ray rejection , low punch - through and precision tracking .",
    "the d  analysis presented here uses the clean muon i d and the ability to reverse the toroid and solenoid magnetic fields .",
    "the d  experiment has extracted the cp - violation parameter of @xmath0 mixing and decay from the dimuon charge asymmetry .",
    "this measurement used an integrated luminosity of @xmath8 pb@xmath9 .",
    "cp - violation in mixing , which has not yet been observed for @xmath4 mesons , is sensitive to several extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "the cp - violation parameter @xmath10 can be obtained by measuring @xmath11 , the asymmetry of the same side lepton pairs coming from direct @xmath4 decays@xcite : @xmath12 @xmath11 is extracted from the dimuon charge asymmetry @xmath13 , where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the number of events with two positive ( negative ) muon candidates passing selection cuts .",
    "the measured @xmath16 must contain only the physics part of the charged asymmetry , separating it from detector effects . in order to relate @xmath16 to @xmath11 , all processes contributing to @xmath16",
    "have to be identified .",
    "the polarities of the toroid and solenoid magnetic fields are reversed roughly every week so that the four solenoid - toroid polarity combinations are exposed to approximately the same integrated luminosity .",
    "this allows cancellation of first order detector effects , as the possibly different reconstruction efficiencies of positive and negative tracks due to different trajectories .",
    "[ detector ]    the muon detector is shown schematically in figure [ detector ] .",
    "let @xmath17 be the number of muons passing cuts with charge @xmath18 , toroid polarity @xmath19 , and @xmath20 if @xmath21 and @xmath22 if @xmath23 .",
    "the physics and the detector are modeled as follows : @xmath24 @xmath25 is the number of muons passing cuts , and @xmath26 is the fraction of integrated luminosity with toroid polarity @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) . equation ( [ asymmetries ] ) defines six asymmetries .",
    "@xmath16 is the dimuon charge asymmetry , @xmath29 is the forward - backward asymmetry ( that quantifies the tendency of @xmath30 to go in the proton direction and @xmath31 to go in the anti - proton direction ) , @xmath32 measures the north - south asymmetry of the detector , and @xmath33 is the range - out asymmetry ( that quantifies the change in acceptance and range - out of muon tracks that bend toward , or away from , the iron toroid magnet ) .",
    "@xmath34 is a detector asymmetry between tracks bending north and tracks bending south . @xmath16 and @xmath29 are physics asymmetries that we want to measure , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are detector asymmetries .",
    "the model ( [ asymmetries ] ) fits 8 numbers @xmath35 with 8 parameters ( @xmath25 , @xmath36 , and 6 asymmetries ) .",
    "the measured value of @xmath16 is @xmath37 the resulting cp - violation parameter , taking into account the weights of the different physics processes producing charged dimuon pairs , and assuming that the asymmetry ( if any ) is due to asymmetric @xmath38 mixing and decay is @xmath39 this is the world best measurement of @xmath10 . the dominating systematic error is due to prompt @xmath40 + @xmath41-decay .",
    "the cdf experiment has measured the cp - violating asymmetry in @xmath1 decays using an integrated luminosity of @xmath42 pb@xmath9 approximately .",
    "the flavor - specific @xmath1 decay occurs in the sm through the dominant tree and penguin diagrams .",
    "their interfering amplitudes induce the cp asymmetry @xmath43 defined as follows : @xmath44 @xmath4-factories recently measured a @xmath45 asymmetry with 2% accuracy , probing for the first time direct cp violation in the @xmath46-quark sector @xcite ; however , additional experimental information is needed because theoretical predictions still suffer from large ( 510% ) uncertainties @xcite , and the observed asymmetries in neutral and charged modes are not consistent , as the sm would suggest .",
    "a measurement from the tevatron is therefore interesting , also for the unique possibility to combine asymmetry measurements in @xmath1 and @xmath47 decays , which provide a model - independent probe for the presence of non - sm physics @xcite .",
    "-mass after the optimized offline selection with individual signal components ( cumulative ) and backgrounds ( overlapping ) overlaid .",
    "contributions to background come from random pairs of tracks which satisfy the selection requirements and partially - reconstructed @xmath48 decays , as resulting from the invariant - mass fit.,width=302 ]    [ fig : acp_1 ]    the sample of pairs of oppositely - charged particles reconstructed with @xmath49 mass assignment , has been used to form @xmath48 meson candidates . after applying a set of optimized selection cuts ,",
    "the resulting @xmath50-mass distribution ( histogram in figure [ fig : acp_1 ] ) shows a clean signal .    despite the excellent mass resolution , the various @xmath51 modes overlapped into an unresolved mass peak , while the pid resolution was insufficient for separating them on an event - by - event basis .",
    "we achieved a statistical separation instead , with a multivariate , unbinned likelihood - fit ( fit of composition ) that used pid information , provided by the @xmath52 in the drift chamber , and kinematics .",
    "the fit used five observables : the invariant @xmath50-mass @xmath53 , the signed momentum - imbalance @xmath54 , the scalar sum of particles momenta @xmath55 , and the @xmath52 of both particles . in @xmath56 , the momentum ( charge ) @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) refers to the softer track . by combining kinematics and charge information ,",
    "the fit separated also @xmath59 from @xmath60 final states .",
    "the fit found three modes contributing to the peak : @xmath61 @xmath62 , @xmath63 @xmath1 , and @xmath64 @xmath65 decays .",
    "a not yet statistically significant contribution of @xmath66 @xmath47 decays was also found .",
    "fit projections are overlaid to data in figure [ fig : acp_1 ] . from @xmath67 reconstructed @xmath1 decays and @xmath68 reconstructed @xmath69 decays , we measured the following uncorrected value for the direct cp asymmetry : @xmath70 above result was then corrected for differences in trigger , reconstruction , and selection efficiencies between @xmath1 and @xmath69 modes    the dominant source of the systematic error was the uncertainty on the @xmath52 model for kaons , pions , and track - to - track correlation . this effect is expected to partially reduce as the size of of @xmath71 meson decays samples , used for calibration of the @xmath52 model , increases . the second important contribution derived from the statistical uncertainty on the nominal value of @xmath72 masses .",
    "since we use the @xmath72 masses measured by cdf , this uncertainty will reduce with the increasing statistic of fully - reconstructed @xmath72 decays .",
    "we quote the following result for the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath1 decays , where all contributions to the systematic uncertainty have been summed in quadrature : @xmath73 which is approximately @xmath74 different from zero , and in agreement with world best results : @xmath75= from the babar collaboration @xcite and @xmath76 , from the belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "cdf result is still limited by the statistic uncertainty ; however , its systematic uncertainty , at the same level of @xmath4-factories , is promising : with significantly more data already collected , we expect to reduce the statistical uncertainty down to 2.5% , which will make cdf result competitive with @xmath4-factories soon .",
    "this cdf measurement exploited an integrated luminosity of @xmath42 pb@xmath9 approximately to measure the ratio @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 is a necessary input of the glw method @xcite to obtain the ckm angle @xmath80 .",
    "we reconstructed the @xmath81 with @xmath82 ( flavour eigenstate ) and the @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( cp - even eigenstate ) .",
    "the @xmath49 mass is assigned to the @xmath4 daughter track .",
    "selection cuts have been applied .",
    "the resulting invariant @xmath86 mass from a generic monte carlo sample is shown in figure [ mc ] , where various @xmath87 are present . to reject most of the background contributions",
    "while keeping the @xmath88 signal , we used the narrow mass window @xmath89 .",
