    "point processes with determinantal correlation kernels have attracted a lot of interest over the past few decades due to the rich mathematical structures behind them and their frequent occurrences in various random models including random matrix theory , random growth and tiling problems , etc .",
    "@xcite . a fundamental issue in the study of determinantal point processes is to establish microscopic limits of the correlation kernels , which often leads to universal results . besides the well - known canonical kernels like the sine kernels for bulk universality , the airy / bessel kernels for soft / hard edge universality and so on ,",
    "some new kernels were found describing critical behavior of certain random models , and they are believed to be universal as well .",
    "this paper deals with two such models in which a similar phenomenon occurs . we intend to retrieve a canonical process ( the pearcey process here ) from the critical phenomenon .",
    "physically , this will lead to descriptions of phase transitions among different processes . for similar transitions between canonical processes ,",
    "we refer to the thesis of deschout @xcite and the recent papers @xcite .",
    "fig3cases1.eps    fig3cases2.eps    fig3cases3.eps    as a first model we consider @xmath0 one - dimensional non - intersecting brownian motions with two starting points at time @xmath1 and two ending points at time @xmath2 .",
    "the transition probability density of the brownian motions is given by @xmath3 where we interpret @xmath4 as a temperature variable .",
    "as the number of paths tends to infinity , these paths will fill out a certain domain in the time - space plane .",
    "depending on the locations of the starting and ending points , the temperature @xmath5 , and the fractions of paths connecting the topmost and bottommost starting and ending points , we distinguish three cases , namely , large , small , and critical separation .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig:3cases ] which is taken from @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "for each fixed @xmath6 , the positions @xmath7 of the brownian paths form a determinantal point process .",
    "it is well - known that the scaling limits of the correlation kernel are given by the sine kernel in the interior of the domain , the airy kernel at a typical point of the boundary , and the pearcey kernel @xcite at a cusp @xcite . in the critical situation",
    "the brownian paths fill out two touching ellipses ; see figure [ fig:3cases](c ) . the point where the ellipses touch is called the tacnode and the local particle correlations around this point",
    "are described by the tacnode kernel .",
    "this tacnode process was recently studied by different groups of authors using different techniques .",
    "adler - ferrari - van moerbeke @xcite resolved the tacnode problem for non - intersecting random walks ( discrete space and continuous time ) .",
    "johansson @xcite gave an integral representation of the extended tacnode kernel in the continuous time - space setting ; see also ferrari and vet @xcite for the asymmetric tacnode process .",
    "delvaux - kuijlaars - zhang @xcite found an expression of the tacnode kernel in terms of a new @xmath8 riemann - hilbert ( rh ) problem .",
    "furthermore , the tacnode process also appears in a random tiling model called the double aztec diamond @xcite .    the critical separation case ,",
    "see figure [ fig:3cases](c ) , can be seen as a limit of the small separation case , in which the two groups of particles merge at a certain time and separate again later , see figure [ fig:3cases](b ) . in this case",
    "the particles fill out a certain shape in the time - space plane with two cusp points . at",
    "these cusp points the limiting particle density vanishes with an exponent @xmath9 which indicates that the local particle correlations are governed by a pearcey kernel .",
    "when we increase the distance between both starting points and both ending points keeping the temperature @xmath5 fixed , or fix the starting and ending points while lowering the temperature @xmath5 , the cusp singularities approach each other to form a tacnode . hence we expect to retrieve the pearcey kernel from the tacnode kernel in a certain limit . one aim of this paper is to describe such a transition .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs in the hermitian two - matrix model , which is a probability measure @xmath10 defined on the space of pairs @xmath11 of @xmath12 hermitian matrices . here",
    ", @xmath13 is a normalization constant , @xmath14 is the coupling constant , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are two polynomials which we take as @xmath17 for a parameter @xmath18",
    ".    the two - matrix model can be integrated in terms of biorthogonal polynomials , see @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions for the eigenvalues of @xmath19 and @xmath20 have a determinantal structure and admit expressions in terms of these polynomials @xcite .",
    "here we are only interested in the eigenvalues of @xmath19 when averaged over @xmath20 , which form a determinantal point process . as the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 vary , we encounter phase transitions .",
    "in particular , the point @xmath23 in the @xmath24-plane corresponds to a multicritical case .",
    "a new kernel , referred to as the critical kernel in this paper , was recently established by duits and geudens @xcite to describe the local eigenvalue correlations near this point .",
    "this critical kernel is expressed in terms of a rh problem ( see rh problem [ rhp : tacnode rhp ] below ) that is a generalization of the one used in the tacnode model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the critical kernel is genuinely different from the tacnode kernel .",
    "although at the first glance not so clear as in the non - intersecting brownian motions model , an analysis of the @xmath25-phase diagram reveals that this critical kernel can be understood as a limiting case of a pearcey kernel or a painlev ii kernel @xcite ; see section [ sec : phase diagram in matrix model ] for details . in @xcite",
    "it was already shown that the critical kernel reduces to the painlev ii kernel by taking a double scaling limit .",
    "the other aim of this paper is then to retrieve the pearcey kernel from the critical kernel , hence , complementing the results in @xcite .",
    "the essential feature allowing us to handle the tacnode kernel and the critical kernel simultaneously is that both kernels have explicit representations in terms of the following tacnode rh problem @xcite .",
