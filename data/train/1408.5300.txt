    "those models were successfully applied to develop quantum algorithms , specially for searching a marked node in graphs  @xcite .",
    "there are other models of quantum walks and some of them do not use an auxiliary hilbert space and have no coin .",

    "@xcite using the coined qw model , which has two subspaces , namely , the coin and spatial parts . taking the model",

    "the coin subspace evolves entangled with its environment . in the asymptotic limit ( @xmath2 ) , after tracing out the spatial part , the coin reaches a final equilibrium state which , if we consider the quantum canonical ensemble , can be seen to have an associated temperature .",

    "we draw the conclusions .",
    "in this section , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we present a brief theoretical development to obtain the wave function of the system .",

    "the hilbert space of the whole system has then the form @xmath9 where the position space , @xmath10 , is spanned by the unitary vectors @xmath11 , and the coin space , @xmath12 , is spanned by @xmath13 orthonormal quantum states @xmath14 . therefore @xmath15 is associated with the axis and @xmath16 with the direction . in the usual qw on the line ( @xmath17 ) ,",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are the right and left states @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the state of the system at any time @xmath22 is represented by the ket @xmath23 which can be expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 we define , at each point @xmath26 , the following ket , @xmath27 which is a coin state , so that @xmath28 as @xmath29 is the probability of finding the walker at @xmath30 and the coin in state @xmath31 , the probability of finding the walker at @xmath30 irrespectively of the coin state is then @xmath32 where we used the fact that @xmath33 is the identity in @xmath12 . clearly @xmath34 because @xmath35 is the identity in @xmath10 .    the dynamical evolution of the system is ruled by @xmath36 where the unitary operator @xmath37 is given in terms of the identity operator in @xmath10 , @xmath38 , and two more unitary operators .",
    "first , the so - called coin operator @xmath39 , which acts in @xmath12 , can be written in its more general form as @xmath40 where the matrix elements @xmath41 can be arranged as a @xmath42 unitary square matrix @xmath43 .",
    "then , @xmath44 is the conditional displacement operator in @xmath45 @xmath46 note that , depending on the coin state @xmath47 , the walker moves one site to the positive or negative direction of @xmath48 if @xmath49 or @xmath50 , respectively .    projecting eq.([map ] ) onto @xmath51 and using eqs.([proj]),([u])([d ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath52 which further projected onto @xmath53 leads to @xmath54 equation ( [ map_x ] ) is the @xmath0-dimensional qw map in position representation .",
    "it shows that for any given time step the wave - function at each point is the coherent linear superposition of the wave - functions at the neighboring points calculated in the previous time step , the weights of the superposition being given by the coin operator matrix elements @xmath55 .",
    "given the linearity of the map and the fact that it is space - invariant , i.e. the matrix elements @xmath55 do not depend on the space coordinates , the spatial discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , which has been used many times in qw studies @xcite , is a very useful technique .",
    "the dft is defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 ; @xmath58 $ ] , is the quasi - momentum vector .",
    "the dft satisfies @xmath59 following eq.([psi_x ] ) we define the components of the wavefunction in momentum space as @xmath60 applying the previous definitions to the map ( [ map_x ] ) , and using @xmath61 we obtain @xmath62 where we have defined a coin operator in momentum space @xmath63 above , @xmath64",
    ".    the matrix elements of the coin operator in this space are @xmath65 projecting eq.([mapket_k ] ) onto @xmath53 and using ( [ ck],[ck_elements ] ) leads to @xmath66 as we see , the nonlocal maps ( [ mapket_x],[map_x ] ) become local in the momentum representation given by eqs.([mapket_k]),([map_k ] ) .",
    "this allows us to easily obtain a formal solution to the qw dynamics , since map ( [ mapket_k ] ) implies @xmath67 therefore the set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath68 is most useful to solve the qw evolution dynamics .",
    "since , according to eq.([evol_k ] ) the operator @xmath69 must be unitary , all its eigenvalues @xmath70 can be written in the form @xmath71 , with @xmath72 real .",

    "entanglement in quantum mechanics is associated with the non separability of the degrees of freedom of two or more particles .",
    "the degrees of freedom involved in entangled states are usually discrete , such as the spins of electrons or nuclei . however , there is also interest in continuous degrees freedom , such as the position or the moment of a particle , due to their potential to increase storage capacity and information processing in quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the unitary evolution of the qw generates entanglement between the coin and position degrees of freedom . the asymptotic coin - position entanglement and",
    "its dependence on the initial conditions of the qw has been investigated by several authors carneiro , abal , salimi , annabestani , omar , pathak , petulante , venegas , endrejat , ellinas1,ellinas2,maloyer , alejo2010,alejo2012 .",
    "in particular in ref.@xcite it has been shown that the coin - position entanglement can be seen as a system - environment entanglement and it allows to define an entanglement temperature . in the present work",
    "we also study this subject using the @xmath0-dimensional qw as a system .",
    "let us briefly review the usual definition of entropy with the aim to clarify the emergence of the concept of entanglement entropy .",
    "the density matrix of the quantum system is @xmath84 the quantum analog of the gibbs entropy is the von neumann entropy @xmath85 owing to the unitary dynamics of the qw , the system remains in a pure state , and this entropy vanishes .",
    "however , for these pure states , the entanglement between the chirality and the position can be quantified by the associated von neumann entropy for the reduced density operator , namely @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the reduced density operator for the chirality evolution and the partial trace , @xmath88 , is taken over the positions .",
    "note that , in general @xmath89 , i.e. , the reduced operator @xmath90 corresponds to a statistical mixture .",
    "the expression for the entropy given by eq.([s2 ] ) , will be used as a measure of entanglement between the position and the chirality of the system . using the properties of the wave - function @xmath91 and the identity @xmath92 for the @xmath0-dimensional delta , it is straightforward to obtain the following expression for eq.([rhoc ] )",

    "one considers that the entanglement between the system associated with the chirality degrees of freedom , characterized by the density matrix @xmath101 , and those associated with the position degrees of freedom , the lattice , is equivalent to the thermal contact between the system and a thermal bath . in equilibrium @xmath103=0 ,   \\label{scho2}\\ ] ] should be satisfied . as a consequence , in the asymptotic regime",

    "note that while temperature makes sense only in the mentioned equilibrium state , the entropy concept can be introduced without such a restriction .",
