    ". however this may not be the case as the rate at which these neutrinos scatter with dark matter particles is poorly constrained  @xcite and could be large , resulting in them diffusing towards our galaxy instead of free - streaming . in this section ,",
    "we constrain the scattering cross section @xmath0 for dm between galaxies using the spectrum of high - energy neutrinos observed by icecube .",
    "the mean free path for scattering is @xmath13 , where @xmath4 is the dark matter mass and @xmath14 is its density in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",

    "if @xmath19 is smaller than the distance between galaxies , then the neutrinos will scatter multiple times , lengthening their path from the source to earth and thereby delaying their arrival .",
    "we assume that the dm mass is much larger than that of the neutrinos and that the scattering is elastic and flavour - universal  @xcite .",
    "a schematic of this effect is shown in figure  [ fig : nu_scatter_diag ] , where we give three broad regimes of scattering . in the case of ` weak scattering ' , we have that @xmath20 and so the path the neutrino has to travel is elongated , causing it to arrive later at the present day ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the case of ` strong scattering ' where @xmath21 has the neutrino scattering so often as it travels from outside our galaxy that it has yet to arrive at earth by the present day .",
    "we now use this formalism to calculate the effect on the flux of extra - galactic neutrinos . without scattering between dm and neutrinos ,",

    "we assume that @xmath24 is proportional to the star formation rate @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "since the effect of dm - neutrino scattering is to delay the arrival of the neutrinos to earth , the redshift at which the neutrino is emitted is no longer necessarily equal to the redshift of the source .",

    "we also show the star formation rate as a function of @xmath31 for comparison.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the time delay due to the dm - neutrino scattering is contained in the ( normalised ) delay function @xmath33 , which gives the probability that a neutrino was emitted at a redshift @xmath31 , given that its source is at a distance corresponding to redshift @xmath30 .",
    "the amount of delay depends on the cross section of scattering between dark matter and neutrinos @xmath0 , which could itself vary with the neutrino energy @xmath1 . for figure",
    "[ fig : hist_e0=1 ] and throughout this work we assume that @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",

    "@xmath33 also depends on the neutrino energy as it travels to earth .",
    "examples of @xmath33 which have been calculated numerically for different values of @xmath36 are shown in figure  [ fig : hist_e0=1 ] , assuming a source distance of 10  mpc corresponding to @xmath37 and a neutrino energy at the source of 1  pev . for @xmath38  @xmath3 ,",
    "the neutrinos reaching earth have been produced recently , and so values of @xmath31 which are close to @xmath30 will contribute to the integral in equation ( [ eqn : nu_flux_diff ] ) .",

    "( [ eqn : nu_flux_nodiff ] ) .",
    "by contrast for @xmath41  @xmath3 and @xmath42  @xmath3 , the longer path means the neutrinos originated from their source farther in the past .",
    "hence for these cross sections , the integral in equation  ( [ eqn : nu_flux_diff ] ) is dominated by values of @xmath31 much larger than @xmath30 . as such for @xmath43  @xmath3",
    ", the majority of neutrinos arriving at the present day will have been produced at @xmath44 , when the star - formation rate was small . in this case",
    ", the neutrino flux would likely be much smaller than that observed by icecube .",
    "we now perform the full integral in equation  [ eqn : nu_flux_diff ] by assuming a specific astrophysical model for the high - energy neutrino flux observed by icecube .",
    "we use the model proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite in which the highest - energy ( @xmath45  tev ) neutrinos originate from the decay of hadrons accelerated at extra - galactic hypernova remnants ( hnr ) ( alternative models for these neutrinos use e.g. active galactic nuclei  @xcite or gamma - ray bursts  @xcite ) .",
    "we calculate the expected flux using eqn .",

    "@xcite , based on a convolution of the spectrum of protons accelerated at the hnr with the secondary neutrino spectrum produced by each proton ( via e.g. pion or muon decay ) .",

    "the result is a cut - off in the spectrum of neutrinos at an energy set by the size of @xmath36 .",
    "this arises from neutrinos which scatter so often that they do not arrive at earth by the present day , even if they are produced when the first hypernovae form around @xmath51 .",
    "larger values of @xmath36 effectively widen the range of energies for which this condition holds .",
    "since as can be seen in figure  [ fig : spectra_dm ] the icecube data extend up to @xmath52  pev we conservatively set an upper limit on a dm-@xmath7 cross section which increases with @xmath53 at the level of @xmath54  @xmath3 .",
    "this limit is robust to changes in the model for the production of these neutrinos , as the cut - off is a generic feature of dm-@xmath7 scattering .",
    "future measurements of higher energy neutrinos will serve to strengthen this upper limit .",
    "in this section , we consider the effects of high - energy extra - galactic neutrinos scattering with dm within our own galaxy , after they have travelled through the igm .",
    "we have already shown that dm-@xmath7 scattering between galaxies results in a cut - off in the spectrum of these neutrinos for large enough cross sections .",
    "however here we show that scattering within the milky way , particularly at the centre of the galaxy , affects the distribution of high - energy neutrino events on the sky .",
    "this is interesting as the icecube collaboration have reported a small ( @xmath55 significance ) clustering of high - energy neutrino events towards the galactic centre  @xcite , which corresponds to approximately @xmath56 of all of their events .",
    "we assume that the neutrinos enter the galaxy from all directions isotropically as expected if their origin is extra - galactic .",
    "however even a kiloparsec from the galactic centre , the dark matter density can reach values as large as @xmath57  gevcm@xmath17 for a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile  @xcite , and the density increases further towards the centre . hence at this dm density , a value of @xmath59  @xmath3 for a pev - energy neutrino would be enough for the mean free path @xmath19 to be of kiloparsec scale or smaller , and so there can be significant scattering between dm and neutrinos towards the galactic centre even given the constraints of the previous section .",
    "this will lead to neutrinos appearing to originate from this region even if they are produced outside of our galaxy .",
    "the effect of dm-@xmath7 scattering within our galaxy on the distribution of extra - galactic neutrinos ( with an energy of 1  pev ) is shown in figure  [ fig : gc_scatter ] for two different values of the scattering cross section ( assuming an nfw profile for the dm ) . for @xmath60  @xmath3 ,",
    "the scattering between dm and pev - energy neutrinos generates a concentration of events towards the galactic centre , where the dm density ( and therefore the scattering rate ) is largest , at the level of about @xmath61 of the total rate . in this case scattering",
    "has altered the direction of travel for these neutrinos and therefore their apparent point of origin .",
    "by contrast for @xmath62  @xmath3 ( and below ) , the neutrino flux remains mostly isotropic . hence @xmath60",
    "@xmath3 gives a similar amount of clustering towards the galactic centre seen in the latest icecube data  @xcite , while values larger than this would introduce too much anisotropy .",
    "the galactic centre is not the only region for which an anisotropy could be observed : the large dm densities towards the cores of dwarf galaxies  @xcite could result in a similar effect from dm-@xmath7 scattering .",
    "the size of this anisotropy depends on the mass model for the dwarf galaxies , which is not well known . for models where the dm density is @xmath45  gevcm@xmath17 within 1  kpc of the centre  @xcite , the mean free path with @xmath60  @xmath3 is smaller than 1  kpc .",
    "hence the flux of high energy neutrinos around e.g. the fornax or sculptor dwarfs could be enhanced by as much as a few percent compared to the average all - sky flux , depending on the density profile .",
    ".here ` gal . ' refers to best - fit cross section @xmath0 to give the required level of clustering seen towards the galactic centre in the recent icecube data  @xcite . `",

    "this leads to a cut - off in their _ spectrum _ at an energy set by the size of the cross section ( figure  [ fig : spectra_dm ] ) .",
    "while for scattering within our galaxy , we found that the _ distribution _ of the neutrinos is shifted from pure isotropy to possessing an excess of events towards the galactic centre , where the dm density is largest ( figure  [ fig : gc_scatter ] ) .",
    "this results from scattering altering the direction of travel for these neutrinos , making them appear to originate from the galactic centre .",
    "we summarise our numerical results compared with those from previous works in table  [ table_constraints ] .",
    "as can be seen , our results probe much higher energy scales than previous constraints from structure formation  @xcite and supernova 1987a  @xcite . throughout this work",
    ", we have assumed that the scattering cross section @xmath0 increases as @xmath53 up to a few pev ( or above ) , since in this case our constraint is particularly strong compared to those set at lower energies .",
    "however this is not the only form which the dm-@xmath7 scattering cross section can take , and the complimentarily between the various constraints serves as an important probe of the energy dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "the upper bound labelled ` ex - gal ' in table  [ table_constraints ] has been set by assuming that the neutrinos originate from hypernova remnants in other galaxies , although any other sources for these neutrinos , astrophysical  @xcite or otherwise  @xcite , would lead to similar constraints . for cross sections larger than this upper limit ,",
    "neutrinos with energies below 2  pev are impeded too much on their way to our galaxy , which would lead to a cut - off in the icecube neutrino spectrum at this energy .",
    "scattering cross sections just below this bound give no observable cut - off while also leading to interesting phenomenology within our galaxy .",
    "indeed the best - fit cross section to give a small cluster of pev - energy events ( @xmath65 ) towards the galactic centre , due to dm-@xmath7 scattering within our galaxy , is @xmath66  @xmath3 ( labelled ` gal ' in table  [ table_constraints ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath55 anisotropy observed in the icecube data - set in this region  @xcite .",
    "cross - sections of this size which scale with @xmath53 also evade the low - energy constraints in table  [ table_constraints ] .",
    "currently there are not enough statistics to make a more precise statement .",
    "however we predict that if dm particles scatter with @xmath67pev energy neutrinos with a cross section around @xmath68  @xmath3 , then future data from icecube ( and experiments such as km3net  @xcite or antares  @xcite ) should show neutrinos with a mostly isotropic distribution plus an excess of events ( @xmath69 of the population ) towards the galactic centre .",
    "the neutrinos are produced in extra - galactic astrophysical sources , with the dm only contributing to the anisotropy through scattering , and so the spectrum will retain the general power - law form expected from such sources regardless of position on the sky ( although the exact spectrum depends on the energy dependence of the cross section ) .",
    "this combined spectral and spatial dependence is a potentially unique prediction compared to alternative models for the anisotropy .",
    "for example although an astrophysical source within our galaxy ( on top of an extra - galactic component ) may result in a similar prediction , it would likely over - produce other signals ( e.g. @xmath70 or cosmic rays )  @xcite .",
    "additionally results from antares disfavour a point source  @xcite .",
    "furthermore models where the neutrinos are produced by decaying or annihilating dm lead to an excess of neutrinos towards the galactic centre , but the spectrum of these events will be very different from those away from this region  @xcite .",
    "we also expect similar @xmath71 anisotropies towards other galaxies such as m87 , within the regions they subtend on the sky , and potentially small anisotropies for the dwarf galaxies near the milky way .",
    "our results are complimentary to bounds on dm-@xmath7 interactions at lower energies  @xcite and also to probes of scattering of e.g. dm with quarks  @xcite , dm with electrons  @xcite , dm with photons  @xcite and self - interactions  @xcite , placing us closer than ever to understanding the nature of  dm .",
