    "it was r. f. williams , in 1976 , who first conjectured that non trivial knotting occur in the lorenz system ( @xcite ) . in 1983 ,",
    "birmann and williams introduced the notion of template , in order to study the knots and links ( i.e. finite collections of knots , taking into account the knotting between them ) contained in the geometric lorenz attractor ( @xcite ) .    a template , or knot holder , consists of a branched two manifold with charts of two specific types , joining and splitting ,",
    "together with an expanding semiflow defined on it , see figure [ charts ] .",
    "the relationship between templates and links of periodic orbits in three dimensional flows is expressed in the following result , known as template theorem , due to birman and williams in @xcite .",
    "[ charts ] +    given a flow @xmath2 on a three - manifold @xmath5 , having a hyperbolic chain - recurrent set , the link of periodic orbits @xmath6 is in bijective correspondence with the link of periodic orbits @xmath7 on a particular embedded template @xmath8 . on any finite sublink , this correspondence is via ambient isotopy .",
    "the dynamics of the semiflow on the lorenz template are described by the first - return map to the branch line , which consists of a one - dimensional map with one discontinuity , surjective and strictly increasing in each continuity subinterval .",
    "what we now call a _ lorenz flow _ has a singularity of saddle type with a one - dimensional unstable manifold and an infinite set of hyperbolic periodic orbits , whose closure contains the saddle point ( see @xcite ) . to describe the dynamics of such a flow",
    "it is necessary to add a geometric hypotheses , just like the one introduced in @xcite to study the original lorenz system . a lorenz flow with this extra assumption",
    "is called a _ geometric lorenz flow_. the dynamics of all these flows can be described by first - return one - dimensional maps with one discontinuity , that are not necessarily surjective in the continuity subintervals .",
    "this maps are called lorenz maps , more precisely , we will adopt the following definition introduced in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "a @xmath11 lorenz map @xmath12\\rightarrow [ p , q]$ ] is a map described by a pair @xmath13 where :    1 .",
    "@xmath14\\rightarrow [ p , q]$ ] and @xmath15\\rightarrow [ p , q]$]are continuous and strictly increasing maps ; 2 .",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 has no other fixed points in @xmath19\\backslash \\{0\\}$ ] .",
    "there exists @xmath20 , the exponent of @xmath18 , such that @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the coefficients of the lorenz map , are @xmath11 diffeomorphisms defined on appropriate closed intervals .",
    "because of the ambiguity at the point @xmath24 , we consider the map undefined in @xmath24 .",
    "this lorenz map is denoted by @xmath25 ( if there is no ambiguity about the interval of definition , we erase the corresponding symbols @xmath26 ) .    in @xcite , martens and de melo introduced some parametrized families of lorenz maps that are universal in the sense that , given any geometric lorenz flow , its dynamics is essentially the same as the dynamics of some element of the family , more precisely , consider @xmath27 the collection of all lorenz maps of class @xmath11 .",

    "a lorenz family is a continuous map @xmath30 , @xmath31    a _ monotone lorenz family _ is a @xmath32 lorenz family such that :    1 .",
    "@xmath33 has negative schwarzian derivative for all @xmath34 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath35\\times [ 0,1]$ ] ; 3 .",

    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 ; 6 .",
    "@xmath46 for all @xmath34 .",
    "in @xcite it is proved that monotone lorenz families are full , in the sense that , if @xmath33 is a monotone lorenz family , then for each given @xmath47 lorenz map @xmath18 there is a parameter @xmath48 such that the dynamics of @xmath33 are essentially the same as the dynamics of @xmath18 .    in @xcite , holmes studied families of iterated horseshoe knots which arise naturally associated to sequences of period - doubling bifurcations of unimodal maps .",
    "it is well known , see for example @xcite , that period doubling bifurcations in the unimodal family are directly related with the creation of a 2-renormalization interval , i.e. a subinterval @xmath49 containing the critical point , such that @xmath50 is unimodal .",
    "basically there are two types of bifurcations in lorenz maps ( see @xcite ) : the usual saddle - node or tangent bifurcations , when the graph of @xmath51 is tangent to the diagonal @xmath52 , and one attractive and one repulsive @xmath53-periodic orbits are created or destroyed ; homoclinic bifurcations , when @xmath54 and one attractive @xmath53-periodic orbit is created or destroyed in this way , these bifurcations are directly related with homoclinic bifurcations of flows modelled by this kind of maps ( see @xcite ) .    considering a monotone family of lorenz maps ,",
    "the homoclinic bifurcations are realized in some lines in the parameters space , called _ hom - lines _ or _ bifurcation bones_.    it is known that ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , in the context of lorenz maps , renormalization intervals are created in each intersection of two hom - lines .",
    "these points are called _ homoclinic points _ and are responsible for the self - similar structure of the bifurcation skeleton of monotone families of lorenz maps .",
    "so it is reasonable to say that _ homoclinic points are the lorenz version of period - doubling bifurcation points_.    the idea of symbolic dynamics is to associate to each orbit of a map , a symbolic sequence , called the _ itinerary _ of the corresponding point under the map .",
    "the pairs of sequences corresponding to the orbits of the critical points determine all the combinatorics of the map and are called _ kneading invariants _ ; from this point of view , the renormalizability of a map is equivalent to the reducibility of its kneading invariant as the @xmath55-product of two other kneading invariants ( see below for the complete definitions ) .    at the topological and dynamical levels , we know a lot about the structure of renormalizable lorenz maps , but , from the point of view of knots and links generated by these maps , as far as we know , this question was only superficially approached in @xcite .",
    "so the objective of this work is to describe the structure and invariants of knots and links generated by renormalizable lorenz maps with kneading invariants of type @xmath56 , by means of the ones generated by @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    ". then we will study sequences of invariants of knots and links generated by sequences of kneading invariants corresponding to the iteration of the @xmath59-product , i.e. , corresponding to pairs of type @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the @xmath59-product of @xmath62 with itself @xmath63 times .",
    "our main theorem describes the links corresponding to @xmath53-tuples of ( renormalizable ) periodic itineraries of type @xmath64 in terms of the links corresponding to @xmath57 and @xmath65 .",
    "this gives one kind of operation that permits us to generate new knots and links from old .",
    "note that , unlike the case of horseshoe knots , studied by holmes in @xcite , this operation do not corresponds to cabling or any other operation that we know . using this result we proceed obtaining explicit formulas for the genus and the braid index of knots and links corresponding to reducible sequences or pairs of sequences depending , respectively , on the genus and on the braid index of each factor .",
    "then we obtain explicit formulas for these invariants associated to pairs of type @xmath66 , concluding that both the genus and the braid index grow exponentially through these sequences .",
    "this is specially relevant since it is known ( see @xcite ) that the topological entropy is constant in the renormalization archipelagoes , and each of these sequences is contained in one archipelago .",
    "so in this cases knot theory provides much finer invariants for the classification of flows .",
    "denoting by @xmath67 , @xmath68 , the @xmath69-th iterate of the map @xmath18 , we define the _ itinerary _ of a point @xmath70 under a lorenz map @xmath18 as @xmath71 , where @xmath72    it is obvious that the itinerary of a point @xmath70 will be a finite sequence in the symbols @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath24 as its last symbol , if and only if @xmath70 is a pre - image of @xmath24 and otherwise it is one infinite sequence in the symbols @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "so it is natural to consider the symbolic space @xmath75 of sequences @xmath76 on the symbols @xmath77 , such that @xmath78 for all @xmath79 and : @xmath80 or @xmath81 , with the lexicographic order relation induced by @xmath82 .",

    "[ bifdiagr ] +    obviously , two maximal or minimal bones corresponding to different sequences can never intersect , so the only intersections we have in the bifurcation skeleton are between maximal and minimal bones .",
