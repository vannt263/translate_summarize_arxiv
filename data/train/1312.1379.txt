    "the study of hamilton cycles for graphs on surfaces was begun in 1931 by whitney @xcite , who showed that @xmath0-connected planar triangulations are hamiltonian .",
    "tutte @xcite later generalized this to all @xmath0-connected planar graphs .",
    "thomassen @xcite ( with a minor correction by chiba and nishizeki @xcite ) further extended this by showing that @xmath0-connected planar graphs are hamilton - connected .",
    "thomas and yu @xcite showed that @xmath0-connected projective - planar graphs are hamiltonian .    in this paper we will be concerned with the following conjecture .",
    "[ conj - grnw ] every @xmath0-connected toroidal graph is hamiltonian .",
    "a number of partial results are known .",
    "altshuler @xcite showed that @xmath1-connected toroidal graphs , which are @xmath1-regular triangulations with a grid structure , are hamiltonian . in the same paper he also showed that @xmath0-connected toroidal quadrangulations , which are @xmath0-regular with a grid structure ,",
    "are hamiltonian .",
    "brunet and richter @xcite proved that @xmath2-connected toroidal triangulations are hamiltonian , and this was generalized by thomas and yu @xcite to all @xmath2-connected toroidal graphs .",
    "thomas , yu and zang @xcite showed that every @xmath0-connected toroidal graph has a hamilton path .",
    "recently some special classes of toroidal graphs , including @xmath0-connected toroidal graphs with toughness exactly @xmath3 , were shown to be hamiltonian by nakamoto and ozeki and by those two authors with fujisawa @xcite . however",
    ", a complete proof of conjecture [ conj - grnw ] still seems a long way off .",
    "one reason conjecture [ conj - grnw ] seems difficult to prove is that the standard inductive approach used for the plane and projective plane can not be extended to the torus .",
    "the results for @xmath0-connected planar and projective - planar graphs in @xcite are essentially proved by strengthening the result in two ways , to enable induction to be used .",
    "the first strengthening is to look for what are known as _",
    "tutte cycles _ instead of hamilton cycles , in @xmath4-connected graphs instead of @xmath0-connected graphs . in the @xmath0-connected case",
    "a tutte cycle must be a hamilton cycle .",
    "some additional control over the tutte cycles is needed , and so the second strengthening is to make sure that the tutte cycle can use any given edge on a designated ` boundary ' of the graph . for @xmath0-connected planar or projective - planar graphs ,",
    "therefore , this means that they are not just hamiltonian but _ edge - hamiltonian _ : every edge has a hamilton cycle through it .",
    "@xmath0-connected toroidal graphs , however , are not in general edge - hamiltonian , and so the same type of inductive arguments fail .",
    "examples of non - edge - hamiltonian @xmath0-connected toroidal graphs were given by thomassen @xcite .",
    "he observed that the cartesian product of two even cycles yields a bipartite @xmath0-connected quadrangulation of the torus , and if a _",
    "( an edge between opposite vertices ) is added in any quadrangle , then that diagonal can not be in a hamilton cycle .",
    "this construction is easily generalized .",
    "take any bipartite @xmath0-connected toroidal quadrangulation @xmath5 , say with a bipartition into black and white vertices . as mentioned earlier , @xmath5 has a grid structure , which we discuss in more detail later .",
    "it also has equally many black and white vertices . in each quadrangle",
    "we can add either a _ black - black _ or _ white - white _ diagonal , specifying the color of its ends .",
    "for any nonempty subset of the quadrangles , add a black - black diagonal across each quadrangle .",
    "then the resulting @xmath0-connected toroidal graph does not have a hamilton cycle through any of the added diagonals .",
    "we will call these _ grid - type _ examples .",
    "even more generally , we can take a bipartite quadrangulation of the torus in which there are equally many black and white vertices , and all white vertices have degree @xmath0",
    ". there may be black vertices of degree @xmath4 or @xmath6 , so the connectivity may be less than @xmath0 . however , it may be possible to make the graph @xmath0-connected by adding black - black diagonals in some quadrangles .",
    "the added diagonals will again not be on a hamilton cycle . in figure [ fig - nongrid ]",
    "the solid edges form a quadrangulation of the torus ( represented in the usual way , as a rectangle with opposite sides identified ) that is only @xmath4-connected .",
    "the addition of the four diagonals ( dashed edges ) makes it @xmath0-connected , but the diagonals are not on any hamilton cycle .",
    "these examples , however , are much harder to characterize than the grid - type examples .",
    "because of these examples , the inductive approach used for planar and projective - planar graphs can not be used for the torus without modification .",
    "a suitable modification might be to prove a result saying that every @xmath4-connected toroidal graph has a tutte cycle through any boundary edge , except when a specific structure resulting from a bipartite subgraph occurs . before trying to prove such a result",
    ", however , it seems sensible to obtain some evidence as to whether the problem ( lack of edge - hamiltonicity ) disappears when we depart even slightly from the bipartite situation . in this paper",
    "we address this by showing that the grid - type examples are critical , in the sense that adding even one white - white diagonal , in addition to the already added black - black diagonals , restores edge - hamiltonicity .",
    "our main theorem is therefore as follows .",
    "[ thm - main ]    the proof of this result makes up section [ sec - mainproof ] , and in section [ sec - concl ] we give some concluding remarks .",
    "most of the proof of theorem [ thm - main ] is accomplished by the following proposition .",
    "[ prop - main ] let @xmath7 be a 4-connected , 4-regular , bipartite simple graph on the torus with partition sets of white and black vertices .",
    "suppose we add a black - black diagonal @xmath8 in one quadrangle of @xmath7 , and a white - white diagonal @xmath9 in a different quadrangle .",
    "then the resulting graph has a hamilton cycle that uses both @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    by euler s formula , we know that all 4-regular , bipartite graphs on the torus are quadrangulations .",
    "as is well known @xcite @xmath0-regular quadrangulations of the torus ( bipartite or not ) can be described ( not necessarily uniquely ) by three integer parameters @xmath10 ( width ) , @xmath11 ( height ) and @xmath12 ( shift ) . to construct the quadrangulation we will denote @xmath13 ,",
    "take an @xmath14-vertex path @xmath15 with vertex set @xmath16 and an @xmath17-vertex cycle @xmath18 with vertex set @xmath19 ( vertices labeled in the obvious order in each case ) .",
    "representing the torus as a rectangle with opposite sides identified , embed the cartesian product @xmath20 with the copies of @xmath15 horizontal and the copies of @xmath18 vertical .",
    "vertices are identified by ordered pairs @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and we specify edges and paths by concatenated ordered pairs .",
    "we place vertex @xmath24 at bottom left , and @xmath25 at top right . in the cylindrical face between cycles @xmath26 and @xmath27 add edges @xmath28 for @xmath23 ( so only the value of @xmath12 modulo @xmath14 matters ) .",
    "for example , figure [ fig - case1.1](a ) and ( b ) show @xmath29 with additional diagonals @xmath30 .",
    "each @xmath31 has an automorphism @xmath32 ( translation up ) which maps every @xmath33 , and an automorphism @xmath34 ( translation right ) which maps @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "fujisawa , nakamoto and ozeki @xcite recently showed that bipartite quadrangulations of the torus in which all white vertices have degree @xmath0 are hamiltonian , satisfying conjecture [ conj - grnw ] , as long as they are at least @xmath6-connected .",
    "perhaps their techniques may yield some results on edge - hamiltonicity after diagonals are added .",
    "there is also a similar conjecture to conjecture [ conj - grnw ] for the klein bottle , and similar counterexamples to edge - hamiltonicity , based on @xmath0-connected bipartite quadrangulations of the klein bottle .",
    "a characterization of such quadrangulations is known @xcite , but it is significantly more complicated than for the torus , and the quadrangulations themselves are not as symmetric as those on the torus , meaning that many more cases would have to be examined to obtain a result similar to theorem [ thm - main ] .",
