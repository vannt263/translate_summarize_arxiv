    "microwave induced magnetoresistance oscillation in high - mobility two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems has been a subject of intensive experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies over the past decades . though a consensus on the period and phase of the oscillation has long been reached , the effect of the microwave polarization on the amplitude of the oscillation remains one of the most challenging and unsolved issues since the discovery of microwave - induced magnetoresistance oscillations .",
    "early measurement on l - shaped hall bars indicated that the period and phase of radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations are insensitive to the relative orientation between the microwave polarization and the current.@xcite a later experiment@xcite carried out on specimens with a square geometry in a quasioptical setup reported a striking result that not only the frequency and phase but also the amplitude of radiation - induced resistance oscillations and the zero resistance regions are notably immune to the sense of circular and linear polarizations of microwaves .",
    "this influential result raised a big challenge to the existing theoretical models , in which , though no detailed investigation was reported , some kind of polarization dependence was believed to exist,@xcite and thus expedited the emergence of different scenarios capable of showing polarization immunity of microwave magnetoresistance response.@xcite in a recent study , mani _ et al_.@xcite found a strong sensitivity in the amplitude of radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations to the relative orientation of the linear polarization with respect to the hall bar axis .",
    "particularly , more detailed measurement@xcite by rotating , by an angle @xmath0 , the polarization direction of linearly polarized microwaves with respect to the long axis of the hall bar electron devices , showed , at relatively low microwave power , a strong sinusoidal variation in the diagonal resistance @xmath1 vs @xmath0 at the oscillatory extrema . and",
    ", unexpectedly , the angle for the maximal oscillatory @xmath1 response under a given - power linear - polarized microwave , which is not at @xmath2 or @xmath3 , appears to depend upon the radiation frequency , the extremum in question , and the magnetic field orientation .",
    "so far , there has been no theoretical explanation for these interesting observations .",
    "there is an urgent need to analyze the detailed polarization dependence from a theoretical model for radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations .",
    "we deal with an isotropic 2d system of short thermalization time , consisting of @xmath4 electrons in a unit area of the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane .",
    "these electrons , scattered by random impurities and by phonons in the lattice , are subjected to a uniform magnetic field @xmath7 in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "when an electromagnetic wave of angular frequency @xmath9 illuminates perpendicularly onto the 2d plane with the incident electric field @xmath10 at @xmath11 and a dc current flows within the plane , the electric field inside the 2d system involves a dc component , @xmath12 , and an ac component @xmath13 the steady - transport state of this electron system can be described by the drift velocity of the electron integrative ( the center of mass ) motion , consisting of a dc part , @xmath14 , and a stationary time - dependent part , @xmath15 in the 2d plane , together with an average temperature @xmath16 , characterizing the isotropic thermal distribution of electrons in the reference frame moving with the center of mass.@xcite they satisfy the following force and energy balance equations:@xcite @xmath17 @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is the time - averaged damping force against the electron drift motion due to impurity scattering , and @xmath20 is the time - averaged rate of the electron energy - absorption from the radiation field . in eqs.([exf0 ] ) and ( [ exsp ] ) , @xmath21 is the effective impurity potential , @xmath22 is the imaginary part of the electron density - correlation function at temperature @xmath16 in the presence of the magnetic field without the electric field , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the bessel function of order @xmath25 with argument @xmath26^{\\frac{1}{2}}/\\omega$ ] .",
    "note that , although contributions of phonon scattering to @xmath27 and @xmath28 are neglected in comparison with those of impurity scattering at the considered low lattice temperature , it provides the main channel for electron energy dissipation to the lattice with a time - averaged energy - loss rate @xmath29 , having an expression as given in ref ..    the ac components @xmath30 and @xmath31 of electron drift velocity should be determined selfconsistently in terms of the incident ac field @xmath32 by the electrodynamic equations connecting both sides of the 2d system , taking into account the scattering - related damping forces @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite however , for high - mobility systems at low temperatures , the effects of these scattering - related damping forces are much weaker in comparison to those of radiative decay @xcite and thus negligible , whence @xmath30 and @xmath31 are in fact directly given from eqs.([2deqv1 ] ) and ( [ 2deqv2 ] ) by the high - frequency electric field @xmath35 inside the 2d electron system . on the other hand , by solving the maxwell equations connecting both sides of the 2d electron gas which is carrying the sheet current density @xmath36 , @xmath35 is determined by the incident fields @xmath37 and @xmath38 based on the setup of the 2d system in the sample substrate.@xcite    if the 2d electron gas locates within a thin layer under the surface plane at @xmath11 of a thick ( treated as semi - infinite ) semiconductor substrate having a refractive index , @xmath39 , the ac field @xmath35 driving the 2d electrons , which equals the sum of the incident and the reflected fields at @xmath11 and equals the transmitted field ( the field just passes through the 2d layer ) , can be expressed as @xcite @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the refractive index of the air and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are , respectively , the light speed and the dielectric constant in vacuum .",
    "if the 2d electron gas is contained in a thin layer suspended in vacuum at the plane @xmath11 , then @xmath44 by combining eq.([thick ] ) or eq.([thin ] ) with balance eqs.([2deqv1 ] ) and ( [ 2deqv2 ] ) , the ac drift - velocity components @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and thus the argument @xmath45 , can be determined by the incident field components @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    the imaginary part of 2d electron density correlation function in a magnetic field , @xmath46 , can be written in the landau representation as @xcite @xmath47\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\,\\hspace{2cm}\\times\\,\\,{\\rm im}g_n(\\varepsilon + { \\it \\omega})\\,{\\rm im}g_{n'}(\\varepsilon ) , \\label{pi_2ll}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the magnetic length , @xmath49^{-1}y^l{\\rm e}^{-y}[l_n^l(y)]^2 $ ] with @xmath50 being the associate laguerre polynomial , @xmath51 + 1\\}^{-1}$ ] is the fermi function at electron temperature @xmath16 , and @xmath52 is the density - of - states ( dos ) function of the broadened landau level @xmath25 .    the landau - level broadening , which results from impurity , phonon , and electron - electron scatterings , is assumed to have a gaussian form [ @xmath53 is the center of the @xmath25th landau level , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , \\label{gauss}\\ ] ] with a @xmath56-dependent half width expressed as @xmath57 where @xmath58 , the single - particle lifetime or quantum scattering time in the zero magnetic field , is assumed to be related to the transport relaxation time @xmath59 or the zero - field linear mobility @xmath60 using an empirical parameter @xmath61 by @xcite @xmath62    for an isotropic system where the frictional force @xmath27 is in the opposite direction of the drift velocity @xmath14 and the magnitudes of both the frictional force and the energy - dissipation rate depend only on @xmath63 , we can write @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in the hall configuration with velocity @xmath14 in the @xmath5 direction @xmath66 or the current density @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , the longitudinal linear ( @xmath69 ) resistivity under the incident radiation of eq.([inci ] ) due to impurity scattering ,",
    "can be written in the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "we consider an incident radiation of form ( [ inci ] ) linearly polarized along the direction having an angle @xmath0 with respect to the @xmath5-axis : @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the 2d electron gas , having carrier sheet density @xmath74m@xmath75 and zero - temperature linear mobility @xmath76m@xmath77/vs from short - range impurity scattering in the absence of the magnetic field , is assumed to locate within a thin layer under the surface plane at @xmath11 of a thick gaas - based substrate with a refractive index of @xmath78 .",

    "the lattice temperature is assumed to be @xmath85k and the landau level broadening parameter is taken to be @xmath99 .",
    "we see that the electron energy absorption @xmath28 and thus the electron temperature @xmath16 , both showing a marked main peak at cyclotron resonance @xmath100 and secondary peaks around its harmonics @xmath101 , are essentially the same for all different polarization directions of radiation .",
    "this can be understood directly from expression ( [ exsp ] ) of @xmath28 in the case of relatively low strength of incident microwave when the dominant contribution to it comes from the terms @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "writing explicitly the @xmath0-dependent expression of @xmath104 in the case of incident plane - polarized radiation having an angle @xmath0 with respect to the @xmath5-axis we can see that , after summing over all the directions of @xmath105 , the angle dependence disappears due to @xmath106 .",
    "furthermore , the energy - loss rate @xmath29 has @xmath0-dependent behavior similar to that @xmath28 .",
    "thus the electron temperature @xmath16 , determined by the energy - balance equation ( 7 ) involving only @xmath28 and @xmath29 , has similar @xmath0-dependent behavior .",
    "the situation is different for the frictional force @xmath27 and the resistivity @xmath1 , because of additional @xmath105-direction dependent weighted factors showing up inside the @xmath107 summation in the expressions ( [ exf0 ] ) and ( [ rixx ] ) , leading to sensitive @xmath0-dependence of @xmath1 as seen from the numerical results shown in the upper part of fig.1 .",
    "the linear - polarized microwave excited magnetoresistivity @xmath1 oscillates strongly , having the same oscillatory period and nearly the same phase and , at cyclotron resonance @xmath100 or its harmonics @xmath108 , taking equal values for all different polarization directions @xmath0 .",
    "we can label , for all @xmath0 , the main peaks and valleys of the oscillatory resistivity respectively as @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , @xmath112 , etc .",
    "the amplitude of resistivity oscillation , however , varies sensitively with changing the polarization direction of the microwave .",
    "the maximal or minimal amplitude of a peak or a valley shows up at different polarization angles @xmath0 for different peaks or valleys .",
    "for instance , the maximal and minimal amplitudes show up , respectively , at @xmath113 and @xmath114 for @xmath109 , at @xmath115 and @xmath116 for @xmath111 , at @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath110 , at @xmath119 and @xmath120 for @xmath112 , and show up at polarization angles closer to @xmath121 and @xmath122 for higher order peaks and valleys . the exact polarization angle for the maximal or minimal amplitude of an extremum appears to depend on the radiation frequency and the 2d electron setup in the substrate . in obtaining the above results the sample setup",
    "is so assumed that 2d electrons locate within a thin layer under the surface plane at @xmath11 of a thick semiconductor substrate having a refractive index of @xmath78 , and the relevant damping in question , i.e. , the radiative decay , is fully determined by this sample setup from the electrodynamic equation ( [ thick ] ) .",
    "except for this , no other damping parameter nor any mechanism capable of producing polarization rotation is introduced in the present model .",
    "next we present the results obtained under magnetic field reversal .",
    "figure 2(a ) plots the longitudinal resistivity @xmath1 vs @xmath123 over the range @xmath87 for the system irradiated by a linearly polarized microwave along the @xmath86 direction with frequency @xmath96ghz and incident power @xmath81w / m@xmath82 .",
    "the extrema of interest here are labeled as @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 for those in the domain @xmath124 , and @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 for those in the domain @xmath125 .",
    "the values of longitudinal resistivity @xmath1 at @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are plotted in fig.2(b ) , and those at @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 qre plotted in fig.2(c ) , as functions of the microwave polarization direction @xmath0 .",
    "the present treatment is for an isotropic system . by symmetry",
    "we always have @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , etc .",
    "if the maximal amplitude of an extremum , e.g. , @xmath88 , shows up at @xmath129 , the maximal amplitude of the corresponding extremum at the reverse magnetic field , @xmath92 , must be at a different polarization angle .",
    "the effect of asymmetry in a real sample itself would produce further complexity .",
    "we have examined the effect of changing the polarization angle @xmath0 of the incident linearly - polarized microwaves with respect to the dc current on radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations within the balance - equation formulation of the photon - assisted magnetotransport model .",
    "the present investigation takes the incident microwave field , rather than the ac field inside the 2d electron system , as the input quantity , allowing a direct determination of the dominant damping mechanism in the high - mobility system , the radiative decay , from the experimental sample setup without introducing any artificial damping parameter , thus enabling a direct comparison with experimental measurement .",
    "we find that the amplitude of radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillation varies sensitively with changing @xmath0 . at an extremum the amplitude of oscillatory magnetoresistance @xmath1 exhibits a sinusoidal , up to a factor of 5 , magnitude variation with rotating the polarization angle @xmath0 .",
    "the maximal amplitude shows up generally at a nonzero @xmath0 , which is dependent upon the extremum in question , the 2d electron setup , the radiation frequency and the magnetic field orientation .",
