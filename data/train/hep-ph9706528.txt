    "in the nonet of pseudoscalar mesons the most interesting one for the investigation of the gluon sector of qcd is the relatively heavy @xmath0 , which is related to the so - called @xmath1 problem @xcite . since the work of thooft @xcite there is little doubt that the large @xmath0 mass has its origin in the gluon sector of qcd .",
    "the singlet @xmath2 , which is the main component of the @xmath0 ( apart from admixtures of the octet meson @xmath4 ) , is expected to couple directly to the gluons via the gluon anomaly and gives an additional mass term for the @xmath0 .",
    "an important ingredient here is the mixing angle which has been determined rather accurately by experiments via the analyses of the decays of the @xmath5 and @xmath0 @xcite during the last years .",
    "there are different approaches to calculate the mass of the @xmath0 . in their pioneering works",
    "witten @xcite and veneziano and di vecchia @xcite constructed a meson lagrangian which includes the gluon anomaly .",
    "as a byproduct witten derived a formula which relates the mass of the @xmath2 to the topological susceptibility .",
    "witten s formula has been a key tools for theoretical investigations using rather detailed models of the qcd gluon vacuum such as the instanton model @xcite or the monopole condensate model @xcite . recently",
    "hutter @xcite was able to relate the topological susceptibility to the gluon condensate in the simple picture of the gluon vacuum as an ensemble of uncorrelated instantons and anti - instantons and obtained a good estimate of the mass of the @xmath0 .",
    "also recently the model of the squeezed gluon vacuum has been considered as an interesting alternative @xcite-@xcite to the above approaches . in the present paper",
    "we discuss the squeezed vacuum in a simple variant and apply it to the @xmath1 problem .",
    "we shall directly relate the anomaly term to the gluon condensate .",
    "numerical results for the gluon condensate are compared with other values given by shifman , vainsthein and zakharov @xcite and also recently by narison @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly recall the @xmath1 problem and discuss its connection to the gluon condensate . in section 3 the effective low energy meson lagrangian which includes an anomalous gluon term is quoted and in section 4 the witten formula is discussed . in section 5",
    "we outline the squeezed vacuum . in section 6 the mass of the @xmath0",
    "is related to the squeezed gluon condensate and numerical results are given . finally our conclusions are drawn .",
    "the pseudoscalar mesons have been well understood as irreducible representations of the flavour su(3 ) . the pions and kaons are members of the octet representation , whereas the @xmath5 and @xmath0 mesons are related to the octet and singlet pseudoscalar states @xmath6 via the mixing @xmath7 with a mixing angle @xmath8 .",
    "different experimental data have been used to determine the mixing angle @xmath8 .",
    "recent analyses of @xmath9 and @xmath0 decays @xcite have obtained a mixing angle @xmath10 the experimental values for the masses of the @xmath5 and the @xmath0 are @xcite @xmath11 > from these experimental values of @xmath12 and @xmath8 one obtains the masses @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the @xmath4 and @xmath2 @xmath15    on the other hand the masses @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be obtained from the following gell - mann  okubo formulae @xcite @xmath16 which have been derived using the gell - mann  oakes  renner relations for the nonet of pseudoscalar goldstone bosons under the assumption of only small explicit chiral @xmath17 symmetry breaking by the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 quark masses . here",
    "@xmath21 mev is the pion decay constant and @xmath22 @xcite is the singlet decay constant .",
    "taking the kaon and pion masses from experiment , this relation gives @xmath23 , which is in reasonable agreement with ( [ m88 ] ) would lead to complete agreement .",
    "this deviation from the experimental value ( [ phiexp ] ) could have its origin in a small deviation from gell - mann  okubo formula which can lead to a relatively large change in the mixing angle . ] .",
    "for the @xmath2 mass , however , the gell - mann  okubo formula yields only a value @xmath24 for @xmath25 , which is much smaller than the experimental ( [ m00 ] ) .",
    "the large squared difference @xmath26 shows that the small explicit chiral symmetry breaking by the current quark masses alone can not account for the large mass of the @xmath2 or the @xmath0 .",
    "this constitutes the well - known @xmath1 problem @xcite .    on the way towards the solution of this puzzle",
    "it is important to note that even in the chiral limit of vanishing quark masses the colour singlet axial @xmath27 quark current @xmath28 is actually not conserved on the quantum level but afflicted with an anomaly due to the gluon sector of qcd @xcite @xmath29 with @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the gluon field strength tensor , @xmath32 is the diagonal matrix of the current quark masses , @xmath33 the strong coupling constant and @xmath34 the number of light quark flavours .",
    "although derived only in the one - loop approximation in the presence of classical background gluon fields it is generally accepted that ( [ anomaly ] ) is actually an operator identity ( see e.g. the discussion in @xcite ) . the anomalous term @xmath35 is known as pontryagin density .",
    "an important condition for a large @xmath0 mass is that there is a possibility for a nonvanishing @xmath35 as will be discussed in the following .",
    "an important concept in this context is the gluon condensate , defined as the expectation value of the local gluonic operator @xmath36 in the nonperturbative qcd vacuum @xcite @xmath37    approximate empirical values for the physical gluon condensate are the estimate @xmath38 by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov @xcite and the update average value @xmath39 obtained by narison @xcite in a recent analysis of heavy quarkonia mass - splittings in qcd .",
    "the value of @xmath40 in the low energy region is not known very well from experiment .",
    "the value used by shifman , vainshtein and zakharov @xcite is @xmath41 and that used by narison @xcite in the low energy region is @xmath42 .",
    "a nonvanishing value of the gluon condensate can lead to a nonvanishing anomalous density @xmath35 and therefore to a large mass of the @xmath0 . as discussed by hutter @xcite for a dilute noninteracting gas of statistically independent instantons and anti - instantons , which are ( anti-)selfdual field configurations in euclidean space with @xmath43 ,",
    "the local gluonic operator @xmath44 defined in ( [ gcop ] ) is proportional to the sum of the number densities of instantons and anti - instantons .",
    "the pontryagin density @xmath35 given in ( [ cpd ] ) , on the other hand , is equal to the difference of the number densities of instantons and anti - instantons in the dilute instanton gas . in the model of the qcd vacuum as a non - interacting ensemble of instantons and anti - instantons",
    "the existence of a gluon condensate is therefore a necessary condition for a nonvanishing value of @xmath35 and hence for a large mass of the @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore it has been suggested in @xcite and will be discussed in more detail in this paper that also a squeezed condensate in minkowski space can lead to a large mass of the @xmath0 through the @xmath1 anomaly .",
    "there are several ways to implement the gluon anomaly in calculations of the meson spectrum in order to obtain the large value of the @xmath0 mass . in ref .",
    "@xcite thooft introduced an effective quark interaction in minkowski space simulating the anomalous term which breaks @xmath1 but conserves the chiral @xmath45 symmetry .",
    "this determinantal interaction has been widely used within effective quark models such as the njl model @xcite .",
    "dorokhov and kochelev @xcite model the @xmath0 as a mit bag where the nonperturbative vacuum of qcd is allowed to enter the bag which leads to instanton induced quark interactions .",
    "they obtain the values @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the pions obtained in the same scenario , however , turn out to be much too heavy .",
    "for the calculation of the mass of the @xmath0 mass in microscopic models of the gluon vacuum , such as the magnetic monopole condensate , the instanton gas model or the squeezed condensate , another quite general approach is very convenient and will be discussed in the next two sections .",
    "it is based on witten s formula derived from a low energy meson lagrangian which contains the axial @xmath1 anomaly at tree level .",
