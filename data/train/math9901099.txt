    "stochastic dynamical systems are used as models for various scientific and engineering problems .",
    "we consider the following class of stochastic dynamical systems @xmath15 where @xmath16 are two real independent wiener processes ( white noises ) and @xmath17 are given deterministic functions .",
    "more complicated stochastic systems also occur in applications ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    for",
    "a planar bounded domain @xmath18 , we can consider the exit problem of random solution trajectories of ( [ eqn1])-([eqn2 ] ) from @xmath18 . to this end , let @xmath19 denote the boundary of @xmath18 and let @xmath20 be a part of the boundary @xmath19 .",
    "the escape probability @xmath21 is the probability that the trajectory of a particle starting at @xmath22 in @xmath18 first hits @xmath19 ( or escapes from @xmath18 ) at some point in @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is known to satisfy ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein )    @xmath23    suppose that initial conditions ( or initial particles ) are uniformly distributed over @xmath18 .",
    "the average escape probability @xmath24 that a trajectory will leave @xmath18 along the subboundary @xmath20 , before leaving the rest of the boundary , is given by ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite )    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the area of domain @xmath18 .",
    "the residence time of a particle initially at @xmath22 inside @xmath18 is the time until the particle first hits @xmath19 ( or escapes from @xmath18 ) .",
    "the mean residence time @xmath27 is given by ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein )    @xmath28",
    "the lagrangian view of fluid motion is particularly important in geophysical flows since only lagrangian data can be obtained in many situations . it is essential to understand fluid particle trajectories in many fluid problems . escape probability ( from a fluid domain ) and mean residence time ( in a fluid domain ) quantify fluid transport between flow regimes of different characteristic motion .",
    "deterministic quantities like escape probability and mean residence time can be computed by solving fokker - planck type partial differential equations .",
    "we now use the these ideas in the investigation of meandering oceanic jets . meandering oceanic jets such as the gulf stream are strong currents dividing different bodies of water .    recently , del - castillo - negrete and morrison ( @xcite ) , and pratt et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) have studied models for oceanic jets .",
    "these models are dynamically consistent to within a linear approximation , i.e. , the potential vorticity is approximately conserved .",

    ", we consider an oceanic jet consisting of the basic flow as in del - castillo - negrete and morrison ( @xcite ) , plus random - in - time noise .",
    "this model incorporates small - scale oceanic motions such as the molecular diffusion ( @xcite ) , which is an important factor in the gulf stream ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the irregularity of rafos floats ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) also suggests the inclusion of random effects in gulf stream modeling .    this random jet may also be viewed as satisfying , approximately in the spirit of del - castillo - negrete and morrison ( @xcite ) , the randomly wind forced quasigeostrophic model .",
    "several authors have considered the randomly wind forced quasigeostrophic model in order to incorporate the impact of uncertain geophysical forces ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they studied statistical issues such as estimating correlation coefficients for the _ linearized _ quasigeostrophic equation with random forcing .",
    "there is also recent work which investigates the impact of the uncertainty of the ocean bottom topography on quasigeostrophic dynamics ( @xcite ) .",
    "the randomly forced quasigeostrophic equation takes the form ( @xcite ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a space - time wiener process ( white noise ) .",
    "the stream function would have a random or noise component ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xmath4 is the meridional derivative of the coriolis parameter @xcite @xcite , i.e. , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the rotation rate of the earth , @xmath2 the earth s radius and @xmath3 the latitude .",
    "since @xmath1 and @xmath2 are fixed , @xmath4 is a monotonic decreasing function of the latitude .",
    "the deterministic meandering jet derived in del - castillo - negrete and morrison ( @xcite ) is @xmath31 where @xmath32 this @xmath33 is an approximate solution of the usual quasigeostrophic model @xmath34    with random wind forcing or molecular diffusive forcing in the stochastic quasigeostrophic model ( [ qg ] ) , the stream function would have a random or noise component .",
    "we approximate this noise component by adding a noise term to the above deterministic stream function @xmath33 , that is , in the rest of this paper , we consider the following random stream function as a model for a quasigeostrophic meandering jet , @xmath35    the equations of motion for fluid particles in this jet then have noise terms .",

    "the recirculating regions are the exterior retrograde regions ; see figure [ unperturb ] .    to",
    "we take @xmath18 to be either an eddy or a piece of jet core ( see figures [ eddy ] , [ jet ] ) .",
    "this piece of jet core has the same horizontal length scale as an eddy , and it is one period of the deterministic jet core ( note that the deterministic velocity field is periodic in @xmath45 ) .",
    "thus we call this piece of jet core a unit jet core .    to    to    from ( [ eqn3 ] ) ,",

    "a piecewise linear , finite element approximation scheme was used for the numerical solutions of the escape probability @xmath21 , and the mean residence time @xmath27 , described by the elliptic equations ( [ eqn3 ] ) , and ( [ eqn6 ] ) , respectively . using a collection of points lying on the boundary , piecewise cubic splines were constructed to define the boundary of the eddy , and the top and bottom boundaries of the jet core .",
    "computational ( triangular ) grids for the eddy and the jet core were then obtained by deforming regular grids constructed for an ellipse and a rectangular region , respectively .",
    "the computed escape probability crossing the upper or lower boundary of an eddy or a unit jet core , for the case of @xmath48 , are shown in figures [ up ] , [ low ] , [ top ] and [ bottom ] .    to    to    to    to    suppose that the fluid particles are initially uniformly distributed in @xmath18 ( an eddy or a unit jet core ) .",
    "we can also compute the average escape probability @xmath24 that a particle will leave @xmath18 along the upper or lower subboundary @xmath20 , using the formula ( [ average ] ) ; see figures [ eddyaverage ] and [ jetaverage ] .",
    "for an eddy , the average escape probability for fluid particles ( initially inside the eddy ) escape into the exterior retrograde region is smaller than escape into the jet core for @xmath6 , while for @xmath7 , the opposite holds ( figure [ eddyaverage ] ) . thus @xmath49 is a bifurcation point .",
    "also , the average escape probability for fluid particles escape into the exterior retrograde region increases as @xmath4 increases from @xmath11 to @xmath50 ( or as latitude decreases accordingly ) , and then decreases as @xmath4 increases from @xmath50 to @xmath13 ( or as latitude decreases accordingly ) .",

    "the opposite holds for the average escape probability for fluid particles escape into the jet core .    for a unit jet core near the jet troughs",
    ", the average escape probability for fluid particles ( initially inside the jet core ) escape into the northern recirculating region is greater than escape into the southern recirculating region for @xmath8 , while for @xmath9 , the opposite holds .",
    "moreover , for @xmath10 , fluid particles are about equally likely to escape into either recirculating regions ( figure [ jetaverage ] ) .",
    "furthermore , for a unit jet core near the jet crests , the situation is the opposite as for near the jet troughs .    to    to",
