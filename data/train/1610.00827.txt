    "since the time when j. chadwick proposed the existence of the neutron and soon later w. heisenberg introduced the new term called isospin more than 80 years ago , the picture of the nucleus consisting of nucleons ( neutrons and protons ) has presented us a tremendous and colorful nature in a more understandable way , while constantly producing new issues to be investigated . in nuclear physics ,",
    "the isospin dependent equation of state ( eos ) of both infinite and finite nuclear matter has been investigated in a deeper and broader range recently @xcite .",
    "in addition to the isovector part of the mean field , i.e. , the symmetry potential term , the isospin dependence of the medium - modified collision term , which comes from the same effective lagrangian density , should also be considered simultaneously @xcite .",
    "this more self - consistent treatment of the transport theory not only deepens our insight into the two - body scattering itself , but also helps to eliminate largely the model - dependence in pinning down the density dependence of the symmetry energy through a comparison of suggested ( but normally in a simpler manner in the beginning ) sensitive observables to the corresponding experimental data .    a new puzzle related to attempts of constraining the density dependence of the symmetry energy at supranormal densities emerged in recent years .",
    "calculations with both the isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( ibuu ) and the lanzhou quantum molecular dynamics ( lqmd ) models showed contradicting results concerning the stiffness of the nuclear symmetry energy at supranormal densities when they were compared with the same fopi experimental data for the @xmath6 yield ratios in heavy - ion reactions @xcite . since then , many more calculations with , e.g. , the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) model @xcite , the boltzmann - langevin approach ( bl ) @xcite , or the t@xmath7bingen version of the qmd ( tuqmd ) @xcite , have entered into this topic with different observables but came up with different conclusions .",
    "this situation even stirred the re - examination of the technical model dependence .",
    "it involved 18 versions of buu- and qmd - type transport models and showed that sizable uncertainties in nucleon - related observables exist .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the extraction of the stiffness of the symmetry energy with the pion - related observables will become much more questionable since pions are the decay products of resonances , mainly the @xmath8 at sis energies .",
    "obviously , the uncertainty might be reduced , but only after the transport process of the @xmath1 resonances in the nuclear medium has been more reliably clarified . although the potential corrections for resonances on the mean - field level have been studied widely and often adopted in models , the medium modifications on @xmath1-related collisions ( more specifically , the cross sections ) are less well investigated and hence much less considered in the transport model calculations .",
    "the situation is even worse regarding the isospin - asymmetric nuclear medium that exists throughout the whole isospin nonequilibrium process of a heavy - ion collision ( hic ) .",
    "progress on this topic was recently made by considering the density dependence of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) inelastic @xmath9 cross section , using a covariant relativistic transport approach @xcite .",
    "it is found that it appreciably decreases the pion yield ( owing to the reduction of the inelastic cross section in the nuclear medium ) but only moderately affects the @xmath6 yield ratio .",
    "the latter observation is likely to be due to the fact that there is no separate treatment of the four isospin states , @xmath2 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath3 in their work .    in a more recent paper  @xcite , song and",
    "ko have considered this issue by investigating the effect of the isospin - dependent medium modification of the pion - production threshold on the total pion yield and their ratio with the help of the relativistic vlasov - uehling - uhlenbeck ( rvuu ) approach , based on mean fields from the nonlinear relativistic nl@xmath12 and nl@xmath13 models .",
    "it is found that , owing to the reduced nucleon- and @xmath1- masses in the medium , the threshold effect obviously enhances the total yield .",
    "owing to the threshold difference for each pion - production channel , the @xmath6 yield ratio is also enhanced , especially at lower beam energies and reproduces the experimental data measured by the fopi collaboration fairly well @xcite . however , in order to reproduce the total pion yield data , an overall density - dependent suppression coefficient for the @xmath14 cross section has to be introduced by hand . and , the isospin effect on the cross sections of each of the @xmath1 production channels is again omitted .    in the current work , based on the effective lagrangian within the framework of the self - consistent relativistic buu ( rbuu ) microscopic transport theory @xcite in which the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 $ ] , @xmath12 , and @xmath18 mesons",
    "are coupled to both nucleons and @xmath8 resonances , we focus on the medium modifications of nn inelastic scatterings and especially in isospin - asymmetric circumstances . because of the splitting effect shown in both nucleon and @xmath1 effective masses , the effective cross sections @xmath19 and @xmath20 are shown to be obviously and inversely affected by the magnitude of the isospin asymmetry , while the other cross sections , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are only weakly dependent on the isospin asymmetry .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in the following sections .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in the next section , the self - consistent rbuu microscopic transport theory for both nucleons and @xmath8 resonances",
    "is introduced . the isospin effect on the mass splitting of isobars of both particles in an isospin - asymmetric system and on the nn inelastic channels is emphasized . in sect .",
    "3 , numerical results for the energy- , density- , and isospin- dependent cross section of the @xmath14 process are shown and analyzed . finally , a summary and outlook is given in sect.4 .",

    "<S> the reduction of the inelastic in - medium cross section is also compared with that of elastic and inelastic cross sections adopted in numerical model calculations , and it is found that the current calculation behaves reasonably well . owing to the mass - splitting effect of both nucleons and @xmath1s , </S>",
    "<S> all individual channels are different from each other in the isospin - asymmetric nuclear medium , similar to the nn elastic cross section . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the largest , and inverse , isospin effect is seen in the production of @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances . </S>",
    "<S> it will definitely influence the production of @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons as well as their yield ratio , and thus affect the use of the latter quantity as a probe of the stiffness of the symmetry energy at supranormal densities . </S>"
