    "carbon nanotubes are very interesting because of their unique mechanical and electronic properties .",
    "a single - wall carbon nanotube can be described as a graphene sheet rolled into a cylindrical shape so that the structure is one - dimensional with axial symmetry and in general exhibiting a spiral conformation called chirality .",
    "the primary symmetry classification of carbon nanotubes is either achiral ( symmorphic ) or chiral ( non - symmorphic ) .",
    "achiral carbon nanotubes are defined by a carbon nanotube whose mirror images have an identical structure to the original one .",
    "there are only two cases of achiral nanotubes , armchair and zigzag nanotubes .",
    "the names of armchair and zigzag nanotubes arise from the shape of the cross - section ring at the edge of the nanotubes .",
    "chiral nanotubes exhibit spiral symmetry whose mirror image can not be superposed onto the original one .",
    "there is a variety of geometries in carbon nanotubes which can change the diameter , chirality and cap structures .",
    "the electronic structure of carbon nanotubes is derived by a simple tight - binding calculation for the @xmath0-electrons of carbon atoms .",
    "of special interest is the prediction that the calculated electronic structure of a carbon nanotube can be either metallic or semiconducting , depending on its diameter and chirality .",
    "the energy gap for a semiconductor nanotube , which is inversely proportional to its diameters , can be directly observed by scanning tunneling microscopy measurements .",
    "the electronic structure of a single - wall nanotube can be obtained simply from that of two - dimensional graphite . by using periodic boundary conditions in the circumferential direction denoted by the chiral vector @xmath2 ,",
    "the wave vector associated with the @xmath2 direction becomes quantized , while the wave vector associated with the direction of the translational vector @xmath3 along the nanotube axis remains continuous for a nanotube of infinite length .",
    "thus , the energy bands consist of a set of one - dimensional energy dispersion relations which are cross sections of those for two - dimensional graphite . to obtain explicit expressions for the dispersion relations , the simplest cases to consider are the nanotubes having the highest symmetry , e.g. highly symmetric achiral nanotubes .",
    "the synthesis of dwnts has been reported recently  @xcite .",
    "their electronic structure was investigated by the local density approximation  @xcite and the tight - binding model  @xcite .",
    "a similar method can be used to investigate the electronic spectra of the fullerene molecules  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the zigzag and armchair double - wall nanotubes(dwnts ) with a small radius . in these dwnts",
    "the difference of fermi levels of individual nanotubes has to be taken into account .",
    "we focus on @xmath4 zigzag tubules and @xmath5 armchair tubules .",
    "they are the best matched , double layer tubules .",
    "firstly , we describe the model for the zigzag nanotubes .",
    "the @xmath6 electronic structures are calculated from the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 are fermi energies of the outer and inner nanotubes ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 are @xmath6 orbitals on site @xmath13 at the outer and inner tubes ; @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the intratube hopping integrals ; @xmath16 are the intertube hoping integrals which depends on the distance @xmath17 and angle @xmath18 between the @xmath19 and @xmath20 orbitals ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "@xmath21 where @xmath18 is an angle between the _ _ i__th atom of the inner shell and the _ _ j__th atom of the outer shell , @xmath17 is the interatom distance and @xmath22 is a intertube distance . the characteristic length @xmath23 .    to describe the parameter which characterized the zig - zag tubules , we start from the graphene layer  @xcite where we can define the vectors connecting the nearest neighbor carbon atoms for zigzag nanotubes in the form : @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26            the distance between atoms in the unit cell is @xmath27 . following the scheme in figs 1,2",
    "@xcite we want to find solution to the double - layer graphene tubules in the form : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 we want to find solution to the above equation in the form of the bloch function @xmath31 denotes @xmath32 or @xmath33 atoms . here",
    "@xmath34 is the coordinate of the @xmath35 atom in the unit cell and @xmath36 is a position of a unit cell , @xmath37 is a number of the unit cell ; @xmath38 is a @xmath0 orbital which is generally different for the outer and inner shell .",
    "we denote @xmath39 @xmath40 now we define the intratube hopping integrals @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the hoping integral in the graphene and @xmath46 is part which depends on the surface curvature and will be computed latter .",
    "so in a tight - binding approximation we get the systems of equations as showing in appendix a.    firstly , we solve the equations in appendix a assuming that @xmath16 is the perturbation .",
    "so we can decouple these @xmath47 equations .",
    "we get @xmath48 equations for the outer shell and @xmath49 for the inner shell .",
    "if we express the state of the outer shell ( eq.5 ) in the form @xmath50 , we get the solutions to the outer shell in the form @xmath51",
    "@xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 where , for instance , @xmath59 similar results for the electronic spectra in the case of inner nanotubes were found in the form @xmath60",

    "the nonzero terms are @xmath76 .",
    "the same holds for the outer nanotube .",
    "the parameters @xmath77 , @xmath78 can be expressed in the form @xmath79 and @xmath80 now we calculate the values @xmath9 and @xmath81 which are different because the inner and outer shell radii are different . due to the curvature",

    "these directions are @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 the requirement of the orthonormality of the hybrid wave functions determines uniquely the fourth hybrid , denoted by @xmath91 , which corresponds to the @xmath92 orbital in graphite .",
    "the hybridization of the @xmath93 bonds therefore changes from the uncurved expression to @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 the mixing parameters @xmath98 can be determined by the orthonormality conditions @xmath99 , @xmath100,@xmath101 .",

    "nanotubes have no gap and have a semiconductor character . if we impose a curvature correction , we get a gap @xmath116 for the outer nanotube and @xmath117 for the inner nanotube . here",
    "@xmath87 is the radius of the inner tube and @xmath118 is the radius of the outer tube .",

    "we compare our results with the previous computed energy gaps . for @xmath154 dwnts",
    "we get a gap which is significantly greater than that computed by density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "it is mainly caused by that the tight - bounding method gives greater gaps for nanotubes with a very small diameter than the dft computations .",
    "another reason is that we describe dwnts as one unified system where single nanotubes partially lose their individual characteristics due to the interactions . for @xmath155 dwnts",
    "we get a similar gap as in  @xcite .",

    "we have @xmath212 @xmath213 and the fermi point is defined by the equations @xmath214 for the inner shell , and @xmath215 for the outer shell , respectively . by virtue of @xmath216",

    "we use the value @xmath223 for the intertube distance in the numerical computations .",
    "we compute spectra for three different geometries .",
    "the first case was symmetric geometry where the atoms @xmath224(@xmath225 ) occupy a position directly above @xmath226(@xmath227),respectively . in the second case ,",
    "we shift the inner shell axially by @xmath228 and in the third case , we rotate the inner shell by @xmath229 from the symmetric orientation . we get the eigenvalues @xmath140 with eigenvectors which can be expressed in the form @xmath141 the spectra for some values of @xmath230 near the fermi points of single nanotubes are depicted on figure 7 . the point @xmath231 is the fermi point of the isolated inner nanotube .",

    "in the present work , we take into account that the fermi levels of the individual nanotubes which create the double wall nanotubes are different . this difference is very important in the double wall nanotubes with small diameters .",
    "the interplay between energy difference of the fermi levels of the individual nanotubes and the energy gap between valence and conducting band of individual nanotubes have a strong effect on the conductivity of double wall nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "the important parameter is also a difference of wave vectors @xmath243 of the individual nanotubes .    to compute the influence of a curvature of the surface on the matrix elements of the secular equation",
    ", we used two methods .",
    "the rehybridization of the @xmath0 orbital method was used for the computation of diagonal matrix elements which define the fermi levels of single nanotubes . to compute the nondiagonal matrix element",
    ", we used the curvature tensor @xmath244 . in the present work",
    ", we get the same gap as in  @xcite which was computed by the rehybridized method for single wall zig - zag nanotubes .",
    "the gap is by a factor of 4 larger than that computed in the previous study  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that we get analytically a 4 time bigger term @xmath245 .",
    "the curvature of the surface opens the gap in the zig - zag swnts but does not open the gap in the armchair swnts .",
    "the fermi level of the outer shell is about @xmath246 ev higher than the fermi level of the inner shell in the case of @xmath4 zig - zag dwnts . in the case of zig - zag dwnts , the curvature does not shift the minimum of the conductance band and maximum of the valence band of the individual nanotubes .",
    "the result is that these dwnts are the semiconductor .",
    "the electronic structure of the @xmath4 dwnts in the absence of the intertube interactions is shown in fig .",
    "4 . due to the difference in fermi levels of individual nanotubes",
    "the valence states are not symmetric to conduction states about the fermi level .",
    "we have a gap @xmath247 mev between the valence band of the outer shell and the conductive band of the inner shell .",
    "the difference in the fermi levels of individual nanotubes has not been taken into account in  @xcite .",
    "they have symmetric valence states to the conduction states , and the energy gap @xmath248 is associated with outer @xmath249 nanotubes in the absence of the intertube interaction .",
    "we get a minimum gap between the valence and conductive band at the points @xmath250 and this energy gap has value @xmath251 mev when the intertube interactions are imposed .",
    "we also compute the energy gaps of @xmath154 and @xmath155 zig - zag dwnts . for @xmath154 dwnts",
    "we get a significantly greater gap than is predicted by dft calculations .",
    "it is mainly due to difference in the energy gaps of @xmath252 swnts .",
    "dft calculations predict energy gaps @xmath253ev .",
    "quasiparticle corrections open the gap to @xmath254 ev  @xcite .",
    "a similar gap is predicted in the present paper .",
    "the values of the minimum energy gaps for different types of zig - zag swnts and dwnts are collected in tables i and ii .",
    "the fermi level of the outer shell is about @xmath255 ev higher than the fermi level of the inner shell for @xmath5 armchair dwnts .",
    "the result is that in the armchair dwnts part of electrons from the valence band of the outer shell comes to the conductance band of the inner shell .",
    "the inner shell will have a negative charge and will have electron conductivity , and the outer shell will have a positive charge and will have hole conductivity . in the case of armchair swnts ,",
    "the fermi points are shifted and the shift depends on the curvature . since the @xmath256 is bigger than @xmath257 , the fermi point @xmath243 of the outer nanotube is smaller than the wave vector @xmath243 of the fermi point of the inner nanotube .",
    "the highest occupied state is located above the lowest unoccupied state in the case of the armchair dwnt .",
    "the differences are @xmath258 ev in the symmetric geometry , @xmath259 ev when inner nanotube is shifted in the direction of the axes and @xmath260 mev in the case of the rotational displacement of the inner with respect to the outer tube .",
    "so armchair dwnts have a semimetallic character .",
    "we get the same character of the conductivity in all computed geometries for the armchair @xmath5 nanotube .",
    "it means that the conductivity does not strongly depend on the relative position of individual shells .",
    "we get similar results , as in  @xcite , for the asymmetric geometry of @xmath5 armchair nanotube , but we have the inverse asymmetry of the electronic spectra . in our model we get the asymmetry because the fermi level of the outer nanotube is higher than the fermi level of the inner nanotube , and the wave vector @xmath243 of the fermi level of the outer nanotube is smaller than the wave vector of the fermi level of the inner nanotube ( fig .",
    "we get similar results also for @xmath240 and @xmath241 dwnts where the highest occupied state is @xmath261 ev above the lowest unoccupied state in the case of @xmath240 dwnts and @xmath262 ev in the case of @xmath241 dwnts .",
    "the main reason why there is a difference in the character of the conductivity of armchair and zig - zag double wall nanotubes is the absence of the shift of the wave vector @xmath263 where the individual zig - zag nanotubes have a minimal gap .",
    "so zig - zag dwnts are semiconductors .",
    "we have a maximum of the valence band of the outer armchair nanotube higher than a minimum of the conductive band of the inner nanotube in the armchair dwnts .",
    "there is no energy gap in armchair nanotubes but there is a shift of @xmath243 .",
    "those are the main reasons why the armchair double wall nanotubes with a small radius are semimetal .",
    "we can also conclude that the shift and rotation of the inner nanotube do not influent largely the main characteristics of the dwnts armchair nanotubes ; therefore , they are stable with their semimetallic character",
    ". it would be interesting to test this prediction in experiment .",
    "generally , we can say that the conductivity depends on the relative position of the wave vectors @xmath263 where the individual nanotubes have a minimum gap .",
    "if there is no shift , the dwnts are semiconductors .",
    "zig - zag swnts have a minimum gap at point @xmath264 .",
    "it means that from our prediction all zig - zag dwnts ought to be semiconductors .",
    "it is partially supported in  @xcite . on the other hand , if there is a shift in the wave vectors where the individual nanotubes have a minimal gap depending on the mutual positions of the fermi levels and the energy gap width of individual nanotubes , the dwnt can be semimetal or semiconductor .",
    "the examples are @xmath5 dwnts where the shift is caused by curvature and @xmath265 dwnts where individual nanotubes have gap minima at the points @xmath266 and @xmath267  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the difference in the fermi level energies and mixing of orbitals localized on the outer and inner nanotubes cause the charge transfer from outer to inner tubules .",
    "we do not take into account that charge transfer between the outer and inner tubules create an electric field between these tubules .",
    "so not all electrons can transfer from the outer shell to the inner shell , as is predicted by the present study .",
    "assumption of this effect can make a reconstruction of the electronic spectra of dwnts .",
    "this is important mainly in the dwnts where the inner nanotube has a very small diameter .",
    "the result can be metallic character of zig - zag dwnts with @xmath268 and @xmath269 inner nanotube , as is predicted in  @xcite .",
    "our calculations predict semiconducting character of @xmath4 dwnts similarly to  @xcite and contrary to  @xcite .",
    "it ought to be resolved .",
    "if inner shell has a radius about @xmath270 and more , the difference between fermi energy of the outer and the inner tubules is small .",
    "so the charge transfer is not significant .",
    "the lower the minimum of the @xmath148 state of the inner nanotube in comparison with the maximum of the @xmath0 state of the outer nanotube the bigger charge transfer is .",
    "if individual nanotubes have metallic character , the charge transfer will be greater then in the case of dwnts where one or both of the nanotubes are semiconductor .",
    "it means for instance that the charge transfer is smaller in the case of zig - zag dwnts than in the case of armchair dwnts with similar radius .",
    "charge transfer is from the outer to the inner nanotube because fermi level of the outer nanotube is higher then fermi level of the inner nanotube .    from eq.71",
    "we get the following formula for the fermi wave vector @xmath243 of the armchair swnt ; @xmath271 for a large radius the fermi wave vector is located at @xmath272 .",
    "as a diameter decreases , the position of @xmath243 shifts from @xmath273 towards the bigger wave vectors .",
    "the dft calculations predict the opposite shift  @xcite .",
    "parameter @xmath274 is smaller than parameter @xmath77 .",
    "it means that because of curvature the hopping integral in the @xmath275 direction is smaller than the hopping integrals in the @xmath276 and @xmath277 directions .",
    "this is the reason why we get the shift of @xmath243 towards the bigger wave vector with decreasing of the radius of the nanotube .",
    "we expect that less symmetric dwnts have no such stable characteristic when we change a relative position of the outer and inner nanotubes .",
    "the oscillation character of a energy gap will not exist in the case of less symmetric dwnts .",
    "the understanding how the rotation of the inner nanotube in different types of dwnts influences electronic properties of this type of nanostructures is needed to design a new type of nanomotors  @xcite .",
