    "the longitudinal @xmath0 scattering carries the most direct information about the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking , no matter whether a physical elementary higgs particle exists or some kind of strongly interacting physics is responsible for this breaking .",
    "in fact , even if a light higgs boson is discovered , the energy dependence of the longitudinal @xmath0 scattering above the higgs mass scale will tell us if the higgs boson unitarizes the @xmath0 scattering fully or only partially , as in some theoretical models with composite higgs  @xcite .",
    "experimental investigation of the @xmath1 scattering as a function of its center - of - mass energy @xmath5 becomes feasible at the lhc .",
    "the techniques for observing the @xmath1 scattering signal in @xmath6 collisions have been extensively investigated and reported in many papers ( @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "they are based on the differences in the emission process of the transverse and longitudinal gauge bosons from the colliding quarks and in the behavior of the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes as a function of their center - of - mass energy and the scattering angle .",
    "those effects are , however , strongly masked by the quark distribution functions inside the proton and by various sources of large background .",
    "it has been found that such techniques as forward jet tagging , central jet vetoing , and cuts on the final lepton transverse momenta are very promising in the isolation of the @xmath1 scattering signal from the background . at the same time",
    ", the above studies clearly showed that such measurement would be experimentally very challenging and typically require from more than a year to several years of lhc running at full nominal parameters to obtain observable effects . in view of this , a deeper understanding of the process on the theoretical side and possible new techniques allowing for a better event selection and a better data analysis can play an important role to make the study feasible in a relatively shorter timescale .",
    "given the importance of the experimental access to the longitudinal @xmath0 scattering channel , we readdress this issue in the present paper .",
    "we analyze the feasibility of observing the signal of an enhanced , compared to the prediction of the sm with a light higgs boson , @xmath1 scattering at the lhc running at an energy of 7 , 8 and 14 tev . as our laboratory for the enhanced @xmath1 scattering we use the higgsless scenario .",
    "if a higgs boson does exist , but with couplings modified compared to the sm so that it does not fully unitarize the @xmath0 scattering , the signal will be weaker and more difficult to observe ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in search for the most efficient event selection criteria , we first present a systematic study of the different mechanisms leading to @xmath0 pair production at the lhc , both in the same - sign and opposite - sign channels .",
    "we justify why and under which conditions the complicated process of @xmath0 production in @xmath6 collisions can be reduced to general considerations on @xmath7 and @xmath8 emission off a quark line .",
    "we then examine the differences between emission and scattering processes of the @xmath2 bosons of well defined , longitudinal or transverse polarizations . for quantitative analyses we apply exact matrix element calculations involving the madgraph generator  @xcite .",
    "we also briefly show that some basic features of @xmath2 emission can be qualitatively understood within the framework of the effective @xmath2 approximation ( ewa )  @xcite .    based on our study",
    ", we propose a new kinematic variable for the longitudinal @xmath9 scattering signal , showing that it gives significant improvement of the signal - to - background ( @xmath10 ) figures compared to all the previously discussed selection criteria .",
    "we furthermore emphasize that @xmath0 scattering with same - sign @xmath2 s offers the best physics potential for the lhc .    in this work ,",
    "we choose to focus on the purely leptonic @xmath2 decays in both the same - sign and opposite - sign @xmath0 scattering processes .",
    "these channels are known as  gold plated \" , in spite of their low statistics , for their relatively low background contaminations and experimental purity .",
    "following the well established  subtraction method \"  @xcite , we define the signal as the enhancement in the production of @xmath0 pairs in association with two parton jets in the higgsless scenario over the prediction of the standard model with a 120 gev higgs : = ( pp jjww)|_higgsless - ( pp jjww)|_m_h=120gev .",
    "[ eq : sigdef0 ] + it is worth to note that even an observation of a light higgs boson does not necessarily exclude a non - vanishing signal , assuming that it may have non - standard couplings to vector bosons .",
    "the signal comes on top of the irreducible background , which is : = ( pp jjww)|_m_h=120gev . for the calculations in the higgsless scenario",
    ", we make no distinction between removing all feynman diagrams involving higgs exchange or setting an inaccessibly large higgs mass ( @xmath11 gev ) in the calculation .",
    "furthermore , instead of using any particular unitarization model , we will assume the @xmath1 scattering cross section saturates just before its partial wave amplitudes hit the perturbative unitarity limit at a @xmath0 center of mass energy around 1.2 tev and stays constant above this value . such assumption defines the practical limiting case for a signal size which is still consistent with all physics principles .",
    "once all the appropriate selection criteria are applied , we find this prescription reduce the signal size by 20 - 23% , depending on the selection details , compared to the purely mathematical higgsless case with no unitarization at all ( of course , mostly affected is the most interesting region of large invariant @xmath0 masses ) .    to a good approximation ,",
    "the signal comes from the scattering of longitudinally polarized @xmath2 bosons , by far the most sensitive to the electroweak symmetry breaking dynamics .",
    "irreducible background is dominated by the transverse @xmath2 production .",
    "the cross sections appearing in the definition of the signal and the background must be calculated in a gauge invariant way , including also @xmath12 ( pure ew ) and @xmath13 ( qcd ) diagrams in which two @xmath2 s are produced but do not interact .",
    "as we shall discuss below , qcd effects in particular play an important role in the correct calculation of the background .    both for the signal and for the background",
    "we perform a full matrix element calculation of the processes @xmath14 and @xmath15 using the madgraph generator , followed by leptonic @xmath2 decay and quark hadronization .",
    "the procedure implies that the intermediate state @xmath2 s are on - shell , which in literature is sometimes referred to as the  production @xmath16 decay \" approximation . in particular , diagrams which contribute to the same final state but do not proceed via an intermediate state consisting of a @xmath0 pair",
    "are here neglected .",
    "the @xmath2 decay is simulated using a private version of pythia  6 which has the appropriate angular distributions for the decays of @xmath7 and @xmath8 implemented .",
    "such modification of the code ( in the standard distribution of pythia  6  @xcite the @xmath2 s are decayed isotropically ) is vital in order to obtain the correct kinematic distributions of the final state leptons . to check the validity of the @xmath2 on - shell approximation ,",
    "a dedicated study was carried out , in which special samples of the @xmath17 process generated using this method were compared in detail with @xmath18 samples generated with the phantom program  @xcite , without resorting to any  production @xmath16 decay \" approximation . after imposing exactly the same generation cuts on both samples , comparisons of the respective kinematic distributions of the final state leptons do not reveal large differences , as shown in fig.[fig : prodxdecay ] .",
    "an overall uncertainty in the normalization amounting to a few per cent is apparent for the ew background , but all lepton kinematics is adequately described .",
    "the signal calculated in the @xmath2 on - shell approximation reveals a deficit of events at low invariant masses of the @xmath19 pair ( @xmath20 gev ) .",
    "however , this kinematic region is of little relevance for the present analysis and , as we will see later , will be almost completely eliminated by the selection criteria .",
    "we conclude that the  production @xmath16 decay \" approximation is unlikely to be a source of any significant bias in the results .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the result ( see table  [ tab : resultspm ] ) is consistent with those of previously published analyses on the same channel  @xcite ( taking into account all the differences in the respective analysis approaches ) , but does not bring much improvement to the subject .",
    "we have presented a detailed phenomenological analysis of @xmath0 scattering at the lhc , which in some aspects contains improvements with respect to the analyses published by other authors .",
    "our analysis was optimized primarily for the discriminating power between alternative scenarios of ewsb and unitarity violation .",
    "the discrimination is based essentially on a counting experiment in which a light sm - like higgs boson as the only source of ewsb should ideally produce an almost null result .",
    "it is not the aim of this work to fine tune the selection in order to produce the best possible @xmath10 , as the exact criteria will change anyway once a full detector simulation is included .",
    "regardless of that it seems clear that the @xmath21 variable is able to provide some new insight into the subject and possibly improve the expected performance in the same - sign @xmath0 channel .",
    "our result with conventional cuts is roughly consistent with previously published results of similar analyses , in particular with the recent ref .",
    "@xcite , if the same conditions and assumptions are applied in both cases .",
    "their best result @xmath22 is the equivalent of our @xmath23 per 100 @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , most of the difference comes from the fact that their analysis includes a cut on the minimum jet @xmath25 at 30 gev which is the standard in lhc experiments , but very costly to the signal as far as @xmath1 selection at high invariant mass is concerned . with the @xmath21 cut instead this result could become even @xmath26 .",
    "the question of a practical minimum jet @xmath25 cut , in particular having in view the large lhc pile - up , is an issue that requires a careful dedicated study which is clearly beyond the scope of the present work . in this paper",
    "we show a strong physics motivation for releasing the stringent cuts on jet @xmath25 ( our analysis implicitly assumes @xmath27 gev , i.e. , jets below that threshold are not reconstructed ) .",
    "the idea of tagging only one forward jet with @xmath28 gev , which should be rather safe , and working out additional criteria to indentify correctly its softer companion , is an interesting possibility that needs to be investigated .",
    "data collected in 2012 may already shed some light on the issue .",
    "our new selection criterion provides potential to improve the final figure of merit regardless of any working assumptions or approximations we have done throughout this paper .",
    "it is clear , however , that many important unknowns still remain and will require a careful experimental study .",
    "one is the vulnerability of @xmath21 to experimental smearing in the measurement of all the individual @xmath25 s .",
    "since @xmath21 is expected to work for 7 or 8 tev nearly as efficiently as for 14 tev , the practical effects of @xmath25 smearing can be studied at the lhc on 2012 data and reasonably assumed not to be worse for future 14 tev data .",
    "top background poses more unknowns .",
    "the total cross section for top production at 14 tev will ultimately have to be measured .",
    "since @xmath29 background to the @xmath9 channel arising from lepton sign misidentification is not completely negligible , the practical profits from using the @xmath21 variable will depend on precise knowledge of the sign matching efficiencies of the individual detectors ( for demonstration purposes we could of course tune the selection so to kill @xmath29 completely , but such procedure would also end up in very low signal and hence is of little practical interest ) .",
    "one should note that an important cross check of the @xmath29 background evaluation can be obtained by comparing the results of the two in principle separate measurements that this analysis involves : the @xmath30 channel and the @xmath31 channel .",
    "since the relative amounts of @xmath0 in the two channels are like 4:1 and the amounts of @xmath29 like 1:1 , the actual ratio will shed some light on the true composition of the sample . with enough data having been collected",
    ", the @xmath31 channel could be even used to estimate the remaining @xmath29 background and subtract it .",
    "certainly it will be crucial to include the electron channels in addition to the experimentally purest muon channels , as the latter alone do not guarantee enough statistical significance .",
    "a further , more detailed , study based on a full detector simulation and detector - specific event reconstruction is vital for the good understanding of rejection capabilities of the detector backgrounds and the resulting purity of electron reconstruction .",
    "overall , results presented in this paper show that there is good chance to get some important hints about the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking already after the first @xmath32 of data at 14 tev , by focusing on the purely leptonic @xmath2 decay channels .",
    "we advocate the importance of the same - sign @xmath0 channel as the most promising one , particularly in the absence of low mass resonances ( 1 - 2 tev ) in the @xmath33 channel .",
