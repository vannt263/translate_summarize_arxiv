    "the remarkable recent progress in the fabrication techniques of nanometric semiconductor structures has stimulated a rapid development of the emerging field of mesoscopic physics @xcite . in particular , the fabrication of devices of a size shorter than the electron coherence length has motivated the study of systems where the conduction electrons exhibit a fully quantum mechanical behaviour .",
    "such systems are the electron analogue of optical devices .",
    "for instance , a multichannel quantum wire can be regarded as the electron counterpart of an electromagnetic waveguide @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", there is an active research on the coherent dynamics of the electron spin in mesoscopic systems @xcite due to its potential applications to the control of electron transport in so - called  spintronic \" devices @xcite , as well as in the implementations of quantum information processing devices @xcite .",
    "such interest is justified by the long decoherence times / distances exhibited by electron spin in semiconductors @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a 1d wire with two spin-1/2 magnetic impurities embedded at fixed positions .",
    "the 1d wire could be realized by a semiconductor quantum wire @xcite or a single - wall carbon nanotube @xcite , while each impurity could be implemented by means of a single - electron quantum dot @xcite .",
    "conduction electrons entering the wire undergo multiple scattering by the two impurities before being reflected or transmitted . at each scattering event the electron and impurity spins elastically interact via an exchange coupling which can induce a spin - flip .",
    "if the two impurities were static , the present system would reduce to the electron analogue of a fabry - perot ( fp ) interferometer with partially silvered mirrors @xcite , with the impurities playing the role of the two mirrors .",
    "it follows that our system can be considered as a generalized fp interferometer where each mirror has a quantum degree of freedom : the spin .",
    "since scattering with magnetic impurities is a well - known source of electron decoherence @xcite , one would expect that , when mirrors with internal degrees of freedom are considered , the typical resonance condition found in a standard fp interferometer @xcite would be modified .",
    "the expected loss of electron coherence is due to the fact that  contrary to scattering by static impurities which give rise to well fixed phase - shifts  scattering by magnetic impurities causes an uncertainty in the phase shift of the scattered electron @xcite .",
    "equivalently , decoherence can be regarded as a consequence of the unavoidable entanglement arising between the electron and impurity spin degrees of freedom @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we analyze the case where _ two _ magnetic impurities are embedded in the wire .",
    "in @xcite we have investigated how non - local correlations arising when the scatterers are in an entangled state affect the wire transmittivity . in the present paper , we will extend our analysis providing all the details of our approach and expand the discussion of the possible applications .",
    "in particular , we will show that perfect resonance , i.e.  perfect transmittivity for suitable electron wave vectors , appears for the singlet maximally entangled state of the impurity spins .",
    "remarkably , these resonant wave vectors turn out to be independent on the electron - impurity coupling constant .",
    "moreover , when this resonant condition is fulfilled , perfect transmittivity is obtained for all possible electron spin states .",
    "on the contrary , a large inhibition of electron transmission through the interferometer is observed for the case of the triplet maximally entangled state . as we have pointed out in a recent work , the above behaviour of the singlet and triplet entangled states",
    "suggests a novel potential use of entanglement as a tool to modulate the conductance of a 1d wire @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ system_approach ] , we describe in detail the system and the approach used to derive all the transmission amplitudes needed to calculate the single electron transmittivity for any arbitrary initial spin state . in section [ one_spin_up ] , we discuss the transmission properties of the interferometer for initial spin states with only one impurity spin up .",
    "perfect  transparency \" is exhibited for the singlet state of the impurities .",
    "section [ conservation ] is devoted to the explanation of this phenomenon . in section",
    "[ ent_controlled ] , we show how our results suggest a possible use of entanglement of the impurity spins as a tool to modulate the transmission of the wire . in section [ aligned_spins ]",
    "we investigate the transmission properties of a different family of impurity spin states , namely the one for which both spins are aligned .",
    "we show that , in this case , entangled states exhibit no relevant interference effects .",
    "finally , in section [ ent_gen ] we propose a scheme to generate maximally entangled states of the impurity spins via electron scattering .",
    "the form that an initial spin state must have in order to have perfect transparency is derived in [ appendix ] .",
    "our system consists of a clean 1d wire into which two spatially separated , identical spin-1/2 magnetic impurities are embedded .",
    "we assume that single conduction electrons can be injected into the wire . due to the presence of an exchange interaction , each conduction electron undergoes multiple scattering with the impurities before being transmitted or reflected .",
    "let us also assume that the electron spin state can be prepared at the input of the wire and measured at its output ( this could be achieved through ferromagnetic contacts at the source and drain of the wire @xcite ) . to be more specific , consider a 1d wire along the @xmath0 direction with the two magnetic impurities , labeled 1 and 2 , embedded at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , as illustrated in figure [ wire ] .     and",
    "@xmath2 , respectively . ]",
    "assuming that the conduction electrons are injected one at a time ( this allows us to neglect many - body effects ) and that they can occupy only the lowest subband , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the electron momentum operator , effective mass and spin-1/2 operator respectively , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the spin-1/2 operator of the @xmath9-th impurity and @xmath10 is the exchange spin - spin coupling constant between the electron and each impurity .",
    "all the spin operators are in units of @xmath11 . since the electron - impurity collisions are elastic , the energy eigenvalues are simply @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) where @xmath14 is a good quantum number .",
    "as the total spin hilbert space is 8d and considering left - incident electrons , it turns out that to each value of @xmath14 there corresponds an 8-fold degenerate energy level .",
    "let @xmath15 be the total spin of the system .",
    "since @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with quantum numbers @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , are constants of motion , @xmath20 can be block diagonalized , each block corresponding to an eigenspace of fixed @xmath18 ( for three spins 1/2 , the possible values of @xmath18 are @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( from now on the subscript @xmath18 in @xmath19 will be omitted ) .",
    "let us rewrite equation ( [ h ] ) in the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 ( @xmath8 ) is the total spin of the electron and the @xmath9-th impurity .",
    "note that in general @xmath25 and @xmath26 do not commute .",
    "here we choose as spin space basis the states @xmath27 , common eigenstates of @xmath26 , @xmath28 and @xmath17 @xcite , to express , for a fixed @xmath14 , each of the eight stationary states of the system as an 8d column .",
    "since @xmath25 and @xmath26 do not commute , the latter in general is not a constant of motion and thus @xmath29 in general is not a good quantum number .    to determine the transmission properties of the interferometer for a given arbitrary initial spin state",
    ", we have to calculate the transmission probability amplitudes @xmath30 that an electron prepared in the incoming state @xmath31 is transmitted in the state @xmath32 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath30 requires the exact stationary states of the system to be derived . to do this",
    ", we properly generalize the quantum waveguide theory approach of reference @xcite for an electron scattering with a single magnetic impurity to the case of two impurities .",
    "note that due to the form of @xmath20 ( see equation [ h2 ] ) coefficients @xmath30 do not depend on @xmath33 , as it will be more clear in the following .",
    "we first consider the subspace @xmath34 and then the subspace @xmath35 .      in this 4d subspace ( @xmath36 )",
    ", both @xmath37 and @xmath29 can assume only the value 1 .",
    "it follows that in this subspace @xmath25 and @xmath26 effectively commute .",
    "the states @xmath38 are thus also eigenstates of @xmath25 and the effective electron - impurities potential @xmath39 in equation ( [ h2 ] ) reduces to @xmath40 note that the two impurities behave as if they were static and the scattering between electron and impurities can not flip the spins .",
    "the four stationary states take therefore the simple product form @xmath41 where the second index in the left - hand side stand for @xmath42 and where @xmath43 describes the electron orbital degrees of freedom . to determine the wave function @xmath44 , we split the @xmath0 axis into the three domains @xmath45 , @xmath46 and",

    "in this 4d subspace @xmath59 and thus @xmath25 and @xmath26 do not commute and @xmath29 is not a good quantum number .",
    "this is a signature of the fact that in this space spin - flip may occur . in each of the 2d @xmath60 subspaces ,",
    "the two stationary states are thus of the form @xmath61 where we have used the labeling index @xmath62 to indicate that the incident spin state of ( [ ansatz ] ) is @xmath63 and where @xmath64 describe the electron orbital degrees of freedom ( from now on we omit the index @xmath14 ) .",

    "it is important to stress again that our calculated transmission amplitudes @xmath100 are exact at _ all _ orders in the electron - impurity coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "this follows from our quantum waveguide theory approach which addresses the determination of the stationary states through resolution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "this approach is different from the perturbative one adopted in @xcite where only a finite number of electron multiple reflections between the two impurities are taken into account performing a few iterations of the fermi golden rule .",
    "the knowledge of all coefficients @xmath30 completely describes the transmission properties of our system .",
    "here we are mainly interested in calculating how an electron with a given wave vector @xmath14 and for some initial electron - impurities spin state @xmath101 is transmitted through the wire . thus assuming to have the incident wave @xmath102 , with @xmath101 being an arbitrary spin state , it is straightforward to see that @xmath102 is the incoming part of the stationary state @xmath103 where @xmath104 for @xmath34 , while @xmath62 for @xmath35 .",
    "it follows that the transmitted part @xmath105 of ( [ sviluppochi ] ) provides the transmitted state into which @xmath102 evolves after multiple scattering . to calculate @xmath105 we simply replace each stationary state @xmath106 in ( [ sviluppochi ] ) with its transmitted part , express the latter in terms of amplitudes @xmath107 and rearrange ( [ sviluppochi ] ) as a linear expansion in the basis @xmath108",
    "this yields @xmath109 with @xmath110 coefficients ( [ alpha_coeff ] ) fully describe how an incoming wave @xmath102 is transmitted after scattering . for instance , the total electron transmittivity @xmath111 can be calculated as @xmath112",
    "in this section , we investigate how the electron transmission is affected by an initial spin state of the two impurity spins belonging to the family @xmath113 with @xmath114 $ ] and @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "this family describes all the states with only one impurity spin up , including both maximally entangled and product states . following the calculation scheme illustrated in subsection ( [ calcul_chi ] ) , the electron transmittivity @xmath111 when the injected electron spin state is @xmath116 can thus be computed setting @xmath117 . the behaviour of @xmath111 when the impurities are prepared in the product states @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) and @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) is plotted in figures 2(a ) and ( b ) , respectively .    a behaviour similar to a fp interferometer with partially silvered mirrors @xcite , with equally spaced maxima of transmittivity , is exhibited . in figure 2(a )",
    "principal maxima occur around a value of @xmath122 ( @xmath123 integer ) which tends to @xmath124 for increasing values of @xmath58 , while in figure 2(b ) they occur at @xmath124 .",
    "as @xmath58 is increased , maxima become lower and sharper .",
    "remarkably , in both cases the electron and impurities spin state is changed after the scattering ( as resulting from the calculated coefficients @xmath125 ) and the electron undergoes a loss of coherence , since we always have @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "the above product impurity spins states thus lead to the typical decoherent behaviour encountered with magnetic impurities which avoids a perfect resonance condition @xmath127 to occur ( see the introduction ) .",
    "we now consider maximally entangled spin states belonging to the family ( [ family2 ] ) for @xmath128 .",
    "let us start with the triplet state @xmath129 ( see figure 3(a ) ) .",
    "a behaviour similar to the case of figure 2 is exhibited .",
    "again the transmitted spin state differs from the incident one , this indicating occurrence of spin - flip .",
    "in particular , when @xmath124 , the transmitted state turns out to be a linear combination of @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "a striking behaviour however appears when the impurity spins are prepared in the maximally entangled state @xmath132 : as shown in figure 3(b ) , the wire becomes  transparent \" for @xmath133 .",
    "in other words , perfect transmittivity @xmath127 is reached at @xmath133 regardless of the value of @xmath58 , with peaks getting narrower for increasing values of @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , under the resonance condition @xmath133 , the spin state @xmath134 is transmitted unchanged .",
    "note that this occurs even if @xmath135 belongs to the @xmath35 subspace where spin - flip is allowed ( see subsection [ subspace_s12 ] ) .",
    "importantly , this phenomenon takes place regardless of the electron spin state .",
    "indeed , in [ appendix ] we demonstrate that the only spin state @xmath101 allowing perfect transparency of figure 3(b ) to occur is of the form @xmath136 with arbitrary complex values of @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the effect of perfect transparency presented in the previous section is clearly due to constructive quantum interference . in this section",
    "we show how this phenomenon can be quantitatively analyzed in terms of hamiltonian symmetries .",
    "let @xmath140 and @xmath141 be the effective representations of @xmath142 and @xmath143 , respectively , in a subspace of fixed energy @xmath12 . using the matrix representations of electron orbital operators @xmath140 and @xmath141 in the basis @xmath144 , it is straightforward to prove that @xmath145 for @xmath146 .",
    "when this occurs the non - kinetic part @xmath39 of @xmath20 in equation ( [ h ] ) assumes the effective representation @xmath147 with @xmath148 being the total spin of the two impurities .",
    "this means that for electron wave vectors fulfilling the condition @xmath146 , the operator @xmath139 ( with quantum number @xmath149 ) becomes a constant of motion whatever the strength of @xmath10 .",
    "this is physically reasonable since the condition @xmath146 implies that the electron is found at @xmath1 and @xmath2 with equal probabilities and , as a consequence , the two impurities are equally coupled to the electron spin .",
    "furthermore , from equation ( [ vk ] ) it follows that @xmath39 vanishes for @xmath35 and @xmath150 .",
    "this is the case for the initial state ( [ chi_transparent ] ) as this is an eigenstate of @xmath28 and @xmath151 with quantum numbers @xmath35 and @xmath150 , respectively ( see also [ appendix ] ) .",
    "therefore , when this state is prepared and @xmath146 , no spin - flip occurs and the wire becomes transparent : an effective quenching of the electron - impurities coupling takes place .",
    "this explains the results of figure 3(b ) .",
    "the same behaviour however does not occur for the state @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) belonging to the degenerate 2d eigenspace of @xmath151 and @xmath154 with quantum numbers @xmath155 and @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) , respectively . since the orthogonal state @xmath131 ( @xmath158 ) lies in the same eigenspace it follows that , when @xmath159 , the transmitted spin state will result in a linear combination of @xmath152 and @xmath131 ( @xmath153 and @xmath158 ) , implying spin - flip and decoherence in agreement with typical behaviour of magnetic impurities .",
    "this explains the decoherent behaviour of figure 3(a ) .",
    "the deeply different behaviours exhibited by @xmath160 and @xmath161 at @xmath162 suggest that , in this regime , electron transmission through the wire is strongly affected by the relative phase @xmath163 between the impurity spin states @xmath118 and @xmath120 appearing in ( [ family2 ] ) . in figure 4",
    "we thus plot the transmittivity @xmath111 when the electron is injected in an arbitrary spin state @xmath164 with the impurities prepared in a state ( [ family2 ] ) as a function of @xmath165 and @xmath163 , for @xmath133 and @xmath166 .",
    "note how the electron transmission indeed depends crucially on @xmath163 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath111 occurs when the impurities are prepared in the singlet state @xmath167 , while its minima occur for the triplet state @xmath168 .",
    "electron transmittivity @xmath111 at @xmath146 and @xmath169 when the electron is injected in an arbitrary spin state @xmath164 with the impurities prepared in the state @xmath170 . ]    in agreement with what was discussed in section [ conservation ] , denoting by @xmath171 the transmittivity for @xmath172 , decoherence effects cause @xmath173 ( it gets smaller and smaller for increasing values of @xmath174 ) while @xmath175 due to occurrence of perfect transparency . to explain why @xmath176 and @xmath177 are , respectively , maxima and minima of @xmath111 , we observe that the set of states ( [ family2 ] ) is spanned by @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "since these two states belong to orthogonal eigenspaces of the constant of motion @xmath139 a linear combination of them can not exhibit quantum interference effects and reduces to a statistical mixture .",
    "this ensures that the transmittivity for a generic state ( [ family2 ] ) will have intermediate values between @xmath177 and @xmath176 .",
    "the most remarkable result emerging from the above discussion is that , within the set of initial impurity spins states ( [ family2 ] ) , maximally entangled states @xmath167 and @xmath168 have the relevant property of maximizing or minimizing electron transmission .",
    "we have chosen @xmath169 to better highlight this behaviour , but this happens for any value of @xmath58 .",
    "this result suggests the appealing possibility to use the relative phase @xmath163 as a control parameter to modulate the electron transmission in a 1d wire @xcite .    according to what was discussed in section [ conservation ]",
    ", perfect transparency ensures that , once @xmath167 is set for obtaining high conductivity of the device , this impurity spins state will not be lost during transport of electrons through the wire .",
    "however , the same is not true for the low conductivity - state @xmath161 which is instead affected by spin - flip events and in general will be destroyed by electron scattering ( see section [ conservation ] ) . for the above entanglement controlled - modulation to be correctly performed , it is thus required that @xmath161 can be protected from spin - flip events . to achieve this , conservation of @xmath139",
    "can again be fruitfully used together with proper spin - filtering .    assume thus that the electrons are injected in a fixed spin state , let us say @xmath116 . as discussed in section [ conservation ] , in the regime @xmath162 conservation of @xmath139 implies that @xmath152 is transmitted ( or reflected ) as a linear combination of @xmath152 and @xmath131 .",
    "it follows that if the electrons are analyzed at the output of the wire in the same incoming spin state @xmath116 , the state @xmath161 of the impurity spins is protected from spin - flip @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath178 the spin - polarized transmission amplitude that the electron is transmitted in the state @xmath116 .",
    "in figures 5(a ) and ( b ) we have plotted @xmath111 and @xmath178 , respectively , for an initial impurity spins state ( [ family2 ] ) with the electron injected in the state @xmath116 and for @xmath162 and @xmath179 .",
    "note how @xmath177 turns out to be lowered in figure 5(b ) compared to 5(a ) .",
    "this is better visible in fig .",
    "5(c ) , where both @xmath111 and @xmath178 , for @xmath180 , are plotted : in both cases maxima and minima occur for @xmath160 and @xmath161 , respectively , but while maxima coincide , minima are lowered in the spin - filtered case .",
    "spin - filtering thus allows the entanglement controlled - transmission task to work even more efficiently .",
    "we have found that @xmath181 for high values of @xmath58 as in figure 3 for @xmath169 .",
    "thus in these cases no spin - filtering is required to protect @xmath161 .",
    "finally , we point out that the result showed in figure 4 opens the possibility of a new maximally entangled states detection scheme .",
    "indeed , electron transmission can be regarded as a probe to detect maximally entangled singlet and triplet states of two localized spins within the family ( [ family2 ] ) . in particular , it should be clear from the above discussion that use of spin - filtering makes the above setup a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) detection scheme both for @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "in particular , for the state @xmath160 , such scheme works as a qnd even without spin - filtering .",
    "not all the sets of maximally entangled states exhibit the effects described in sections [ one_spin_up ] , [ conservation ] and [ ent_controlled ] . to show this , in this section , we consider a different family of impurity spins states @xmath182 where again @xmath114 $ ] and @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "family ( [ uu_dd ] ) describes all the states in which the impurity spins are aligned .",
    "the transmittivity @xmath111 for an electron incoming in the up spin state is shown in figures 6 ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) for the cases @xmath183 ( a ) , @xmath184 ( b ) and @xmath185 with arbitrary @xmath163 ( c ) .",
    "note how the maximum of @xmath111 in the case of figure 6(c ) has an intermediate value between the maximum of @xmath111 of figure 6(a ) and the one of figure 6(b ) . additionally , the results of figure 6(c ) do not depend on the value of @xmath163 .",
    "the above behaviour can be easily understood once one realizes that , in the case of the initial spin state ( [ uu_dd ] ) the two impurities indeed behave as if they were prepared in the mixed state @xmath186 the phase @xmath163 thus plays no role for the present family of states and no interference effect occurs .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath187 and @xmath158 are eigenstates of the constant of motion @xmath17 with different quantum numbers @xmath188 and @xmath157 , respectively .",
    "therefore , unlike the set of states ( [ family2 ] ) , no quantum interference effects are possible .",
    "additionally , note that while in the cases of figures 6 ( b ) and ( c ) a loss of electron coherence is exhibited similarly to the cases of figures 2(a ) , 2(b ) and 3(a ) , a coherent behaviour completely analogous to a fp interferometer with partially silvered mirrors @xcite is observed when the impurities are prepared in the state @xmath189 with the electron injected in the state @xmath116 , as illustrated in figure 6(a ) .",
    "indeed , the spin state @xmath187 belongs to the non degenerate eigenspace @xmath34 , @xmath188 where spin - flip does not occur and the impurities behave as if they were static ( see subsection [ subspace_s32 ] ) .",
    "however , we emphasize that at variance with perfect transparency induced by the impurities singlet state shown in figure 3(b ) , here @xmath127 for values of @xmath57 _ depending _ on @xmath58 and only when the electron spin is initially aligned with the spins of the impurities .",
    "the effect of transparency presented in figure 3(b ) thus requires neither the knowledge of the coupling constant @xmath10 nor any constraint on the electron spin state to be observed .",
    "to observe the entanglement dependent electron transmittivity discussed in [ one_spin_up ] , [ conservation ] and [ ent_controlled ] one must be able to prepare the maximally entangled states @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "in particular this is required to observe the entanglement controlled transmittivity illustrated in section [ ent_controlled ] .",
    "although in our hamiltonian model ( [ h ] ) there is no direct interaction between the two impurities , an indirect coupling via the electron spin takes place , as it is implicit in the non - kinetic part of @xmath20 . in this section",
    "we thus show how electron - impurities scattering itself can be used to generate the desired entanglement between the impurity spins .",
    "we first observe that it is enough to be able to generate only one of the two states @xmath160 and @xmath161 since they can be easily transformed into each other by simply introducing a relative phase shift by means of a local field . in the following ,",
    "we therefore show how the triplet state @xmath161 can be generated by electron scattering .",
    "generation of entangled states of two magnetic impurities via electron scattering in 1d systems has been recently investigated in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to inject an electron in the state @xmath116 with the two impurities prepared in the state @xmath190 . due to conservation of @xmath17 the transmitted spin state",
    "is of the form @xmath191 it follows that if the transmitted electron is analyzed in the down spin state @xmath192 the two impurities are projected in the entangled state @xmath193 ( apart from a normalization factor ) with probability @xmath194 . for a fixed electron energy , this state is not maximally entangled for any strength of the electron - impurity coupling constant @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "however in @xcite the role played by the distance @xmath195 between the impurities was not taken into account . in the remaining of this section",
    "we will therefore consider an improved entanglement generation scheme @xcite making use of the exact knowledge of the energy eigenstates developed above .",
    "in particular we will consider the regime @xmath162 . in this case , in addition to @xmath17 , also @xmath139 becomes a constant of motion .",
    "it follows that the transmitted spin state will be of the form ( see also section [ conservation ] ) @xmath196 an output filter selecting only transmitted electrons in the state @xmath192 can thus be used to project the impurities into the state @xmath168 . note that at variance with the analysis discussed in @xcite , this scheme ensures that a maximally entangled state is always generated whatever the value of @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , we also know that this is the maximally entangled triplet state @xmath161 .",
    "the spin - polarized probability @xmath197 for the electron to be transmitted in the state @xmath192 - that is to project the impurities into @xmath161 - is plotted in figure 7 as a function of @xmath58 .",
    "spin - polarized electron transmittivity @xmath197 at @xmath146 as a function of @xmath58 when the electron is injected in the state @xmath116 with the impurities prepared in the state @xmath190 . ]    a probability larger than 20% can be reached with @xmath198 .",
    "to discuss the possibility to observe the effects presented in this paper , in particular the entanglement controlled transport , let us assume an electron effective mass of @xmath199 ( as in gaas quantum wires ) and two quantum dots ",
    "each one of size 1 nm  as the impurities .",
    "furthermore , the electron wavelength must be large enough for the contact electron - dot potential of our hamiltonian model ( [ h ] ) to be valid .",
    "this constraint implies that the electron energy must not exceed 2 mev . in this case , requiring that @xmath200 ( i.e. , as shown in section [ ent_gen ] , the optimal condition for generating entangled states of the impurities ) we obtain @xmath201 1 ev , which appears to be a reasonable value of the electron - impurity coupling constant .    to prevent many - body effects , whose occurrence would make the single electron - approach adopted in this work not valid , electrons could be shot over an additional tunnel barrier before interacting with the impurities as proposed in @xcite .",
    "this would allow the injection of single electrons within a narrow energy range well separated from the fermi energy .",
    "alternatively , this task could be accomplished using a single - electron turnstile @xcite as suggested e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "finally we would like to comment on the effects of decoherence on the interference phenomena described above .",
    "some of the most interesting features of electron spin in semiconductor nanostructures are the long decoherence times , which is typically larger than 100 nanoseconds ( but can exceed in some cases the microsecond ) and the long coherence lengths , which can be longer than 100 micrometers .",
    "our approach is therefore able to predict an observable effect .",
    "for instance for an electron energy of 2 mev , the resonance condition @xmath202 implies that @xmath195 must be in the order of 100 nm .",
    "a coherence length of this order of magnitude is common in a gaas quantum wires at low temperatures ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "of course a stationary state approach to scattering like the one we have used must be complemented with a dissipative map for the evolution of the impurity spins when one is interested in the steady state which can be obtained by the repeated injection and detection of electrons in the wire .",
    "in summary , in this paper we have considered a 1d wire with two embedded spin-1/2 magnetic impurities .",
    "this system can be regarded as the electron analogue of a fabry perot interferometer in which the two mirrors have internal spin degrees of freedom . adopting an appropriate quantum waveguide theory approach ,",
    "we have derived all the necessary transmission amplitudes at all orders in the electron - impurity coupling constant .",
    "this has allowed us to calculate the electron transmission properties for an arbitrary initial spin state of the overall system .",
    "the typical behaviour is a loss of electron coherence induced by spin - flip events due to scattering by the magnetic impurities .",
    "however , when the maximally entangled singlet state of the impurity spins is prepared , we have found that perfect transparency of the wire is obtained regardless of the electron spin state at wave vectors which do not depend on the electron - impurity coupling constant . in the same regime",
    ", we have found that electron transmittivity is maximized ( minimized ) by the singlet ( triplet ) entangled states of the impurity spins .",
    "this suggests a novel use of entanglement as a tool to modulate the conductivity of a 1d wire .",
    "additionally , the electron transmission can be thought as a probe to detect maximally entangled singlet and triplet states of two localized spins .",
    "when spin - filtering is performed , this is a qnd detection scheme for both these states , while it works as a qnd detection scheme for the singlet state even without spin - filtering .",
    "these behaviours have been explained in terms of the hamiltonian symmetries , showing that appropriate electron wave vectors allow for an effective conservation of the squared total spin of the two impurities .",
    "finally , we have proposed a scheme to generate maximally entangled states via electron scattering regardless of the electron - impurity coupling constant .",

    "in this appendix we demonstrate that the only spin state @xmath101 allowing perfect transparency of figure 3(b ) to occur is of the form @xmath203 . to this",
    "we impose that the incoming and transmitted state coincide for values of @xmath57 which do not depend on @xmath58 .",
    "this yields the conditions @xmath204 let us define the following matrix of transmission amplitudes in the subspace @xmath35 @xmath205 taking into account ( [ alpha_coeff ] ) and the selection rules for @xmath29 and @xmath206 , conditions ( [ trasparency ] ) reduce to an equation for @xmath34 and a homogenous linear system of two equations for @xmath35 @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the @xmath209 identity matrix .",
    "let us assume that @xmath101 has a non vanishing projection on @xmath34 .",
    "this means that @xmath210 for at least one @xmath33 and condition ( [ transp_s32 ] ) gives @xmath211 which implies @xmath212 .",
    "@xmath213 is the transmittivity of a wire with two static impurities of potential @xmath214 ( see subsection [ subspace_s32 ] ) which is completely analogous to a fp interferometer with partially reflecting mirrors . since in this case",
    "a resonance condition ( transmittivity 1 ) occurs at values of @xmath57 _ depending _ on the mirror reflectivity @xcite , we conclude that @xmath211 can not occur at values of @xmath57 independent on @xmath58 as for the case of figure 3(b ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath215 ( remind that coefficients @xmath216 are @xmath33-independent ) .",
    "this implies that the spin states allowing occurrence of perfect transparency must fully lie in the subspace @xmath35 .",

    "is fulfilled for @xmath220 with @xmath123 integer .",
    "replacement of ( [ kx0_eq_npi ] ) in ( [ transp_s12 ] ) yields the @xmath58-independent solution @xmath221 with arbitrary coefficients @xmath222 ( @xmath60 ) . rewriting these as @xmath223 and @xmath224",
    ", @xmath101 turns out to be of the form @xmath225 using clebsh - gordan coefficients , spin states inside brackets turn out to be @xmath226 substitution of ( [ psi_meno_up ] ) and ( [ psi_meno_down ] ) into ( [ chi_sviluppo ] ) proves that spin states exhibiting perfect transparency are of the form @xmath227 .",
