    "knots and braids , beside being fascinating mathematical objects , are encoded in the foundations of a number of physical theories , either as concrete realizations of natural systems or as conceptual tools .",
    "the atomic model based on knot theory , proposed in the nineteenth century , is a well known ( although wrong ) example of interaction between the experimental analysis of reality , on the one hand , and the need for classifying the observed structures in well defined mathematical categories , on the other .",
    "a much more recent example is provided by ` knotted ' configurations of dna strands .",
    "+ since knots are collections of ` knotted ' circles and braids are ` weaving ' patterns , the term ` knitting ' in the title of this paper seems the more appropriate to describe collectively these structures .",
    "moreover , knots and braids are indeed closely interconnected since from a braid we can get a multi  component knot ( or a ` link ' ) by simply tying up its free endpoints , while from a knot drawn in a plane we can select portions which look like ` over ' and ` under'crossing strings ( _ cfr . _ fig . [ knots ] and fig .",
    "[ closures ] below ) .    on the conceptual side , it was in the late 1980 that knot theory was recognized to have a deep , unexpected interaction with quantum field theory @xcite . in earlier periods of the history of science , geometry and physics interacted very strongly at the ` classical ' level ( as in einstein s general relativity theory ) , but the main feature of this new , ` quantum ' connection is the fact that geometry is involved in a global and not purely local way , _",
    "i.e. _ ` topological ' features do matter . to illustrate this point ,",
    "consider a knot embedded in the three  dimensional space .",
    "what really matters is the way in which it is ` knotted ' , while the length of the string and the bending of the various portions of the string itself can be changed at will ( without cutting and gluing back the endpoints ) . over the years",
    "mathematicians have proposed a number of ` knot invariants ' aimed to classify systematically all possible knots . as will be illustrated in sections 2 and 3 ,",
    "most of these ` invariants ' ( depending only on the topological features of the knot ) are polynomial expressions ( in one or two variables ) with coefficients in the relative integers .",
    "it was vaughan jones in @xcite who discovered the most famous polynomial invariant , the jones polynomial , which connects knots with quantum field theory and plays a prominent role in the present paper . in the seminal work by edward witten @xcite",
    ", the jones polynomial was actually recognized to be associated with the vacuum expectation value of a ` wilson loop operator ' in a particular type of three  dimensional quantum field theory ( the non  abelian chern  simons theory with gauge group @xmath0 ) .",
    "+ braids appear naturally in this context too , since we can always ` present ' a knot as the closure of a braid .",
    "moreover , braids enrich the purely topological nature of the theory since the set of crossings of any braid can be endowed with a group structure .",
    "the artin braid group on @xmath1 strands ( to be defined in section 2 ) encodes all topological information about ` over ' and ` under ' crossings into an algebraic setting , opening the possibility of describing polynomial invariants of knots in terms of ` representations ' of this group .",
    "thus , the jones polynomial can be interpreted not only as the ` trace ' of a ( suitably chosen ) matrix representation of the braid group @xcite , but also as the operatorial trace of an observable in a unitary quantum field theory @xcite . in section 3 below we shall provide the ( minimum ) mathematical background needed for understanding this crucial issue , and realizing ` quantum knitting ' . + the search for new algorithmic problems and techniques which should improve ` quantum ' with respect to classical computation is getting more and more challenging",
    ". most quantum algorithms run on the standard quantum circuit model @xcite , and are designed to solve problems which are essentially number theoretic ( such as the shor algorithm ) . however , other types of problems , typically classified in the field of enumerative combinatorics , and ubiquitous in many areas of mathematics and physics , share the feature to be ` intractable ' in the framework of classical information theory . in this latter perspective , the first section of the present paper deals with a list of algorithmic questions in knot theory and in the theory of finitely presented groups , focusing in particular on the braid group and its algebraic structure encoded into the yang  baxter relation .",
    "these examples are interesting not only for mathematicians and computer scientists , but are addressed by physicists in the study of both exact solvable models in classical statistical mechanics @xcite ( where yang  baxter equation reflects the integrability properies of such models ) and quantum field theories ( such as topological field theories mentioned above and conformal field theories @xcite ) . + in section 3 we give the essential mathematical apparatus underlying the construction of link polynomials .",
    "this will set the stage for the last section , where algorithmic questions concerning the calculation of such topological invariants are raised and discussed .",
    "indeed , in the late 2005 dorit aharonov , vaughan jones and zeph landau @xcite found an efficient quantum algorithm for approximating the jones polynomial ( a difficult problem to be addressed in the classical context ) , thus giving a fundamental improvement of previous claims on the computational complexity of such problem @xcite .",
    "two papers of ours @xcite provided essentially similar results for a wider class of link invariants , and the paper by wocjan and yard @xcite addressed and extended the algebraic and information  theoretical background used in @xcite . the quantum algorithm in question ( reviewed and discussed in section 3 ) represents a breakthrough for quantum computation because the problem of approximating the jones polynomial has been recognized to be a ` universal problem ' , namely the hardest problem that a quantum computer can efficiently handle .",
    "the latter remark sounds reminiscent of ` quantum knitting ' : we can really knit knots and braids by means of ` quantum ' computing machines .",
    "a _ knot _ @xmath2 is defined as a continuous embedding of the circle @xmath3 ( the @xmath4dimensional sphere ) into the euclidean @xmath5space @xmath6 or , equivalently , into the @xmath5sphere @xmath7 .",

    "an isotopy can be thought of as a continuous deformation of the shape of , say , @xmath16 which makes @xmath14 identical to @xmath13 without cutting and gluing back the ` closed string ' @xmath14 .",

    "such a projection , together with ` over ' and ` under ' information at the crossing points depicted in figures by breaks in the under  passing segments is denoted by @xmath18 ; a _ link diagram _",
    "@xmath19 is defined similarly . in what follows",

    "however , notwithstanding the recursively numerable character of the implementation of the reidmeister moves with respect to the intractability of the notion of ambient isotopy , such moves can not be formalized into effective algorithms , basically because the above definition is purely topological .",

    "let us point out that in geometry ( as well as in physical field theories whose dynamical variables have a geometric nature ) an important role is played by ` topological invariants ' . to illustrate this point and clarify its connection with the systematic classification of geometric structures , consider the case of surfaces .",
    "in particular , any smooth , closed and oriented surface @xmath31 has a well defined topological structure , completely determined by its euler number @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the number of ` handles ' of @xmath31 .",

    "the existence of such a ` complete ' invariant in @xmath34dimensional geometry is quite an exception : higher dimensional geometrical objects ( smooth @xmath38manifolds ) do not share this feature , and the associated classification problems are still open ( except for some restricted classes ) .    coming back to knot theory , we define a _ link invariant _ through a map @xmath39 where the quantity @xmath40 depends only on the type of the link , namely takes different values on inequivalent links . switching to link diagrams , we keep on using the same notation as in ( [ linkinv ] ) ,",
    "but now it is sufficient to verify that @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) does not change under applications of the reidemeister moves i , ii , iii ( fig .",
    "[ reidemeister ] ) .",
    "we have already met a numerical invariant , namely the ( minimum ) crossing number @xmath42 .",
    "it is a natural number which takes the value @xmath43 for the trivial knot represented as an unknotted circle .",
    "other invariants taking values in @xmath44 ( relative intergers ) can be defined for oriented link diagrams , where each crossing is marked by @xmath45 according to some fixed convention .",
    "for instance , the _ writhe _ @xmath46 of a diagram @xmath38 of an oriented link @xmath8 is the summation of the signs of the crossings of @xmath38 , namely @xmath47 where the sum runs over the crossing points @xmath48 and @xmath49 if the ( directed ) knot path shows an overpass at the crossing point @xmath50 , @xmath51 for an underpass .",
    "note however that both the crossing number and the writhe do change under reidmeister move of type i , but are invariant under the moves ii and iii : this property defines a restricted kind of isotopy , commonly referred to as _ regular isotopy_. the concept of regular isotopy is very useful because , by eliminating the move i , we do not really lose any information about the topology of the link .",
    "moreover , the evaluation of crossing numbers and writhes can be carried out efficiently by a simple inspection of the diagrams .    over the years , mathematicians have provided a number of knot invariants , by resorting to topological , combinatorial and algebraic methods .",
