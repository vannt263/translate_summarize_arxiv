    "the fiercely idealized and simplifying notion of thermal equilibrium that treats systems devoid of contact with their environment in a fully relaxed state long after their preparation has nevertheless had profound impact in setting a framework for a microscopic basis of phenomenological thermodynamics and our understanding of macroscopic condensed matter systems built from many interacting constituents .",
    "most dynamic processes in nature however occur in out - of - equilibrium settings , where the system under consideration is either subject to strong time - dependent external perturbations ( beyond the linear response regime ) , or where , e.g. , a non - vanishing energy , mass , or electric current flows through it . despite considerable effort , a fundamental conceptual framework of non - equilibrium systems akin to equilibrium statistical mechanics is still lacking .",
    "this is even true for non - equilibrium steady states , whose macroscopic observables are time - independent : neither do we have a general recipe to construct the associated probability distributions , nor to generically characterize the stationary probability currents that are indispensable for their complete classification .    a promising avenue to achieve partial progress in this important and difficult area is naturally provided by the study of continuous phase transitions and the accompanying critical phenomena , since these should be governed by universal features that could hopefully be amenable to systematic characterization through dynamical universality classes within a renormalization group methodology . indeed ,",
    "numerical and theoretical investigations of non - equilibrium phase transitions in classical stochastic dynamical systems have over the past four decades led to notable advances ; and this brief review attempts to summarize some of the key results .",
    "in addition , it has transpired that as compared with thermal equilibrium , generic scale invariance represents a far more ubiquitous feature in driven systems . over only the past few years , detailed experiments have unambiguously confirmed the relevance of the most prominent non - equilibrium universality classes beyond the realms of mathematics and computer simulation , and quantitatively checked the predicted power laws . in the quantum world too , both theoretical and experimental studies of externally driven systems as well as of the non - equilibrium relaxation kinetics following sudden parameter quenches have recently become a highly active research field .",
    "one would therefore anticipate that the analysis of strong spatio - temporal fluctuations and long - range correlations with associated scaling phenomena is likely to remain important in condensed matter physics and materials science , but will gain prominence in ( bio-)chemistry , systems biology , ecology , and finance .",
    "to set the stage , we begin with a brief review of scaling theory as devised for continuous phase transitions and critical points in thermal equilibrium .      continuous or second - order phase transitions in thermal equilibrium are characterized by the emergence of characteristic thermodynamic singularities in the vicinity of the critical point @xcite .",
    "these appear specifically in the thermodynamic limit , where the number of constituents @xmath0 along with other extensive quantities ( such as volume @xmath1 , free energy @xmath2 , entropy @xmath3 , etc . )",
    "are taken to infinity , with the respective densities @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 held fixed .",
    "typically , there are two relevant control parameters that govern the behavior of the singular contributions of the free energy @xmath7 per particle in the vicinity of the critical point : the relative distance @xmath8 from the critical temperature @xmath9 , and the magnitude of a ( symmetry - breaking ) external field @xmath10 , thermodynamically conjugate to the order parameter @xmath11 that characterizes the phase transition . the critical point",
    "is then located at @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and the scaling hypothesis for @xmath7 asserts that it assumes the form of a generalized homogeneous function as @xmath14 , @xmath15 : @xmath16 the singular contribution to the free energy density hence satisfies a remarkable two - parameter scaling law , with distinct analytic scaling functions @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , which only depend on the ratio @xmath20 , and satisfy @xmath21 const . , and with merely two independent thermodynamic critical exponents @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these are related to the singular behavior of certain thermodynamic quantities near the critical point : the specific heat at @xmath13 scales according to @xmath24 , indicating a divergence at @xmath9 if @xmath25 , and a cusp singularity for @xmath26 .",
    "the order parameter equation of state is obtained via @xmath27 , which yields the coexistence curve in the low - temperature ordered phase ( @xmath28 ) at @xmath13 : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "next , the critical isotherm at @xmath12 follows from the requirement that the @xmath31 dependence in @xmath32 must cancel the singular prefactor : @xmath33 , and consequently @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "finally , the isothermal order parameter susceptibility becomes @xmath36 , where @xmath37 ( on both sides of the phase transition ) .",
    "eliminating @xmath38 gives the following set of scaling relations that link the various thermodynamic critical exponents : @xmath39    landau s general mean - field description of phase transitions relies on an expansion of the free energy density @xmath7 in terms of the order parameter @xmath11 , subject to the fundamental symmetries of the physical system under consideration .",
    "for example , for a scalar order parameter @xmath11 with discrete inversion ( @xmath40 ) symmetry @xmath41 one would expand @xmath7 as follows : @xmath42 for @xmath43 , a continuous phase transition ensues at @xmath44 , where the spontaneous order parameter changes from @xmath45 at @xmath46 to either of the two degenerate values @xmath47 for @xmath48 , whence @xmath49 with @xmath50 , and where @xmath51 denotes the mean - field critical temperature . the corresponding mean - field critical exponents in landau theory",
    "are readily found to be @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the divergence of the order parameter susceptibility , which according to the equilibrium fluctuation - response theorem is intimately related to the mean - square order parameter fluctuations @xmath57 , indicates that the latter become very prominent in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "hence spatial fluctuations need to be properly included in the theoretical description of continuous phase transitions @xcite . to this end",
