    "states that can be interpreted as the first quanta of collective vibrations are a general property of quantum mesoscopic systems which can be found in various fields of physics . in nuclear physics ,",
    "such vibrational states of the nucleus have been known for many years  @xcite .",
    "these one - phonon states are present both in the low - lying excitation spectra of nuclei and at higher energies .",
    "the latter are the giant resonances ( gr ) .",
    "the existence of two - phonon states , i.e. states which can be described as double excitations of elementary modes , has also been predicted since the early days of the collective model  @xcite .",
    "such states have been observed long time ago in the low - lying spectra .",
    "more recently , two - phonon states built with giant resonances have been populated in heavy ion inelastic scattering  @xcite , in double charge exchange ( @xmath2 ) reactions  @xcite and in coulomb excitation at high energy  @xcite . for a review ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the harmonic approximation ,",
    "these states are predicted as degenerate multiplets located at an excitation energy equal to the sum of the individual phonon energies .",
    "when the residual interaction is taken into account , the degeneracy is broken by the coupling between phonons . in the present article",
    "we consider the residual interaction of two - phonon states among themselves and with one - phonon states .",
    "therefore , the eigenstates are linear combinations of one- and two - phonon components while the energies are shifted and splitted with respect to the harmonic limit .",
    "we will call such states mixed states .",
    "evidence of such anharmonic behaviour can be found , for example , in a @xmath3 experiment  @xcite where the observation of large dipole strength in the low - lying spectrum of some @xmath4 isotopes is reported .",
    "such strength is interpreted by the authors as due partially to the population of the @xmath5 member of the quintuplet of states based on the @xmath6 two - phonon state , and partially to the admixture of the ( one - phonon ) gdr in the wavefunction of the state observed around 3.5 mev excitation energy . as it has been shown in  @xcite",
    ", the inclusion of the residual interaction among two - phonon states leads to small , but sizeable , anharmonicities also in the high - lying spectrum , namely for those states that in the harmonic limit are described as double excitations of gr .",
    "the mixing between one- and two - phonon states further increases the anharmonicities .",
    "when an external field acts on a nucleus , it excites the eigenstates of the internal hamiltonian , which , in our approach , are superpositions of one- and two - phonon states .",
    "the microscopic theory suited for the description of collective vibrational states is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "two - phonon states and their mixing among themselves and with one - phonon states can be generated by using boson mapping techniques and by taking into account terms of the residual interaction which do not enter at the rpa level  @xcite . in this way one has an rpa based approach to treat anharmonicities .    in a nucleus - nucleus collision ,",
    "the mutual excitation of the two partners is described as due to the action of the mean field of each nucleus on the other one , i.e. by a one body operator . assuming that it induces small deformations of the density , only the particle - hole ( ph ) terms of the external mean field are usually taken into account .",
    "this amounts to consider as elementary processes only those corresponding to the creation or annihilation of one phonon . in this approximation ,",
    "the external field is linear in the creation and annihilation operators of phonons .",
    "when the particle - particle ( pp ) and hole - hole ( hh ) terms of the external field are also included , the direct excitation from the ground state to two - phonon states as well as the transition between one - phonon states become possible .",
    "these terms can be expressed as quadratic in the creation and annihilation operators of phonons and so correspond to non - linear terms in the excitation operator .    in the `` standard '' approach , based on the independent multiphonon picture ,",
    "the effects coming from both anharmonicities and non - linearities are neglected ( see for instance ref.@xcite ) .",
    "recent experimental data on coulomb excitation at relativistic energies have raised some questions on the adequacy of that picture . indeed , in the excitation of @xmath7xe on @xmath0pb , the experimental cross section to the double gdr ( dgdr ) has been found to be 2 to 4 times larger than the theoretical one  @xcite .",
    "recently , new experimental results  @xcite on the excitation of several nuclei have shown that the disagreement ranges from about 10% to 60% , being about 30% in the case of @xmath0pb . in a previous paper  @xcite , by using a one - dimensional oscillator model to mimick nuclear states , we have shown that the effects of anharmonicities and non - linearities can lead to an important enhancement of the cross section in the energy range around twice that of the gdr . in this model neither spin nor parity",
    "were taken into account .",
    "besides , only one type of phonons was considered . in the present paper we present more realistic calculations , where the collective states of the target nucleus and the action on it of the coulomb field of the projectile are described starting from rpa .",
    "anharmonicities and non - linearities are included by means of boson mapping techniques .",
    "both low - lying collective states and giant resonances are considered as elementary phonons .",
    "we have done calculations for the @xmath0pb@xmath8pb system at 641 and 1000 mev per nucleon for which experimental data exist  @xcite .",
    "we have also studied the coulomb excitation of @xmath1ca in the reaction @xmath0pb@xmath9ca at 1000 mev / a although there are no experimental data for this case . in both cases we consider as elementary modes all natural - parity rpa phonons whose multipolarity is lower than 4 and whose contribution to the associated energy weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) is larger than 5% .",
    "then , we have built the residual interaction in the one and two - phonon space and we have diagonalized the hamiltonian in this subspace in order to define the mixed states @xmath10 . by solving the time dependent schrdinger equation in this subspace we get the probability amplitudes for each of the @xmath10 states from which we calculate the cross section .",
    "we will describe in detail the results for the @xmath0pb@xmath8pb system at 641 mev / a , the results at 1000 mev / a being essentially the same except for the absolute values of the cross section which are higher in the latter case .",
    "we will mostly discuss the two regions around the energy of the states built with two low - lying states or with two giant resonances .",
    "we will see that non - linearities and anharmonicities may strongly change the cross sections associated with some specific states .",
    "their influence is found to be of the order of 10% for @xmath0pb and 20% for @xmath1ca in the dgdr energy region , bringing the theoretical results closer to the experimental ones .    in the next section we detail the model employed and in section 3",
    "we describe the semiclassical electromagnetic field used to excite the nuclei .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the description of the results on @xmath0pb where we discuss in a detailed way the effects of both anharmonicities and non - linear terms on the excitation cross section .",
    "the results for @xmath1ca are reported in section 5 and finally we draw our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "heavy ion collisions at high incident energies can be described within a semiclassical approach , where the relative motion is treated classically while quantum mechanics is used for the internal degrees of freedom of the colliding nuclei . for grazing and large impact parameter collisions the densities of the two nuclei",
    "have a small overlap .",
    "therefore , the total hamiltonian can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the hamiltonian of nucleus a(b ) and @xmath13 @xmath14 being the internal hamiltonian of a. @xmath15 describes the excitation of a by the mean field @xmath16 of nucleus b , whose matrix elements depend on time through the relative coordinate * r*(t ) . the sums over the single particle states , denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , run over both particle and hole states .      within rpa ,",
    "the excited states @xmath19 of each nucleus are described as superpositions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 configurations with respect to the ground state @xmath22 @xmath23 |\\psi_0>\\ ] ] where the amplitudes @xmath24 and @xmath25 are solutions of the rpa secular equation , with eigenvalues @xmath26 .",
    "the ground state is defined as the vacuum of the @xmath27 operators @xmath28 in order to avoid unnecessarily complicated expressions , we do not introduce explicitly the coupling to total angular momentum and isotopic spin .",
    "when the rpa phonons are mapped onto bosons  @xcite , the internal hamiltonian of the nucleus can be written as @xmath29 which shows that the excitation spectrum is harmonic .",
    "the boson operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the above equation are given by @xmath32\\ ] ] with the same x and y amplitudes as in eq.(3 ) but in terms of the boson images ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) of the ph operators @xmath35 in the above equation we have indicated only the first term of the boson mapping . assuming that the external field induces only small deformations of the density , only @xmath20 and @xmath21 terms contribute to @xmath15 and one gets @xmath36 by introducing the boson mapping of eq.(7 ) , it can be rewritten as @xmath37 with @xmath38    the independent multiphonon picture is based on eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 9 ) . within this picture ,",
    "the schrdinger equation can be solved exactly and the state of each nucleus at time t is found to be the coherent state @xmath39^{n_\\nu } \\over n_\\nu ! } e^{-i",
    "n_\\nu e_\\nu t }      ( q^\\dagger_\\nu)^{n_\\nu } |0>\\ ] ] with @xmath40 where the integral is performed along the relative motion trajectory corresponding to a definite impact parameter .",
    "the probability amplitude to excite one- or two - phonon states is calculated by projecting eq . ( 11 ) on the corresponding states @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the vacuum of the @xmath30 operators .",
    "finally , the cross sections are obtained by integrating the relevant probabilities over the impact parameter .      in this section",
    "we present an approach to go beyond the independent multiphonon picture by eliminating its two main limitations , the first in the external field and the second in the internal hamiltonian .",
    "let us first consider the @xmath44 and @xmath45 contributions to the sums in eq.(2 ) , which are neglected in the linear approximation for the external field .",
    "assuming the same boson mapping , truncated at the lowest order , it is easily shown  @xcite that the mappings @xmath46 @xmath47 are exact , in the sense that they preserve the commutation relations between fermion - pair operators .",
    "using these relations , the inclusion of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 terms in eq.(2 ) gives a w quadratic in the boson operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 . by expressing the latter in terms of the collective bosons @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 one gets @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the standard linear response expression , whereas @xmath52 @xmath53 provide new excitation routes .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath16 depend on the considered excitation mechanism .",
    "since the general discussion we present here is independent of their form , we postpone to the next section the derivation of their expressions in the case of coulomb excitation at relativistic energy .    the hamiltonian @xmath54 , with the inclusion of the terms @xmath55 and @xmath56 , is a quadratic form in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 operators .",
    "therefore , a coherent state solution to the schrdinger equation still exists .",
    "we do not exploit this property because it does not hold any more when the anharmonicities are included , as we are going to do in next subsection .",
    "the effects of introducing non - linear terms in the external field can be important , for example , whenever some selection rule disfavours one of the two steps necessary to make the transition from the ground state to a two - phonon state through the action of @xmath57 alone .",
    "the term @xmath58 describes the transition from the one - phonon state @xmath19 to @xmath59 or from a two - phonon state to another one . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that these non - linear terms can lead to an increase of the population of two - phonon states .",
    "the term @xmath56 induces a direct transition from the ground state to a two - phonon state that can be very important .",
    "this effect has been already reported in  @xcite where the direct matrix element between the ground state and the dipole member of the low - lying @xmath60 quintuplet of states in some sn isotopes was found to be very large .",
    "similar results , but involving double gr states , have been obtained in  @xcite .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the other limitation of the independent multiphonon picture we have stressed above , namely the assumption that the internal hamiltonian has the harmonic form of eq.(5 ) .",
    "the simplest way to go beyond this approximation starts from the observation that in rpa only the @xmath61 and @xmath62 terms of the residual interaction are taken into account .",
    "the @xmath63 and @xmath64 terms , when expressed by the same boson mapping used before , introduce a coupling between two - phonon states  @xcite while the remaining , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , terms mix one- and two - phonon states . finally , when considering two - phonon states one should also take care of the possible violation of the pauli principle . in the boson mapping method",
    "the exclusion principle is introduced through high order terms in the boson expansion  @xcite built to conserve the fermion - pair commutation algebra . in such a way an additional residual interaction between two - phonon states coming from the particle - hole matrix elements",
    "is generated @xcite . as a result of these different couplings ,",
    "the eigenstates of the internal hamiltonian of each nucleus are @xmath67 therefore , the states excited by the external field will be such mixed states and one can not speak of pure one- or two - phonon excitations any more . however , when a @xmath68 state has a strong overlap with a one - phonon state we may discuss the associated cross - section as part of the one - phonon cross - section .",
    "conversely , if the @xmath68 state is dominated by its two - phonon components we may speak about two - phonon strength .",
    "for example , let us consider a state @xmath68 which strongly overlaps with a two - phonon state , i.e. whose largest component is @xmath69 .",
    "in addition to the possible excitation of @xmath68 via this two - phonon component , this state can also be excited by @xmath57 through its one - phonon components .",
    "however , the energy @xmath70 of @xmath68 will be not far from @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , it will contribute to the cross section at that energy . in this sense , because of its structure and of its energy , one may say that it contributes to the two - phonon cross section .",
    "this fact was disregarded in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the mixing of a huge number of one- and two- phonon states was considered .",
    "a good description of the width of the gdr was thus achieved .",
    "however , all the @xmath68 states were considered to be one - phonon states when they were excited through their one - phonon components while the two - phonon excitations were calculated in  @xcite as the transition to states of the form @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , that calculation is somewhat equivalent to consider a harmonic spectrum with the states @xmath68 as the elementary quanta .",
    "the cross section is calculated , non perturbatively , by solving the schrdinger equation in the space of the ground state and the @xmath68 states .",
    "then the time dependent state , @xmath73 , of the nucleus can be expressed as @xmath74 where the ground state is also included in the sum as the term @xmath75 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath76 are solutions of the set of linear differential equations @xmath77 and the probability of exciting the internal state @xmath68 is given by @xmath78 for each impact parameter .",
    "finally , by integrating @xmath79 over the impact parameter we obtain the cross section @xmath80 where the transmission coefficient @xmath81 has been taken equal to a sharp cutoff function @xmath82 .",
    "the parameter @xmath83 is usually chosen such that the contribution from the nuclear part can be neglected .",
    "let us now look in detail the multipole expansion of the external field of eq.(2 ) .",
    "alder and winther @xcite have worked out an analytic expression for the fourier transform of the semiclassical electromagnetic field in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions , with the assumptions that the projectile follows a straight - line trajectory and that the charge densities of both nuclei do not overlap .",
    "therefore , to get the time dependence of the electromagnetic coupling potential the inverse fourier transform of the expressions derived in @xcite can be taken .",
    "this procedure has the advantage that the multipole expansion of the time dependent coupling potential is readily known as well as its electric and magnetic components .",
    "let us introduce the fourier components of the time dependent coupling potential @xmath84 introducing the expansion of the external field in multipoles @xmath85 @xmath86 where we have taken into account the behaviour of the multipoles @xmath85 for negative @xmath87 .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the contribution to @xmath88 of the @xmath89 multipole can be expressed in terms of electric ( @xmath90 ) and magnetic ( @xmath91 ) one - body operators @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the adiabaticity parameter related to the impact parameter @xmath94 and to the lorentz contraction factor , @xmath95 , and where @xmath96 are the modified bessel functions .",
    "the expressions of the functions @xmath97 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the 2@xmath98-pole electric transition operator is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the current density operator while @xmath101 is a spherical bessel function .",
    "this operator can also be written down @xcite as @xmath102 where the charge density operator @xmath103 has been introduced .",
    "the second term will be neglected since , relative to the first , it is of the order of @xmath104 .    to get the time dependent coupling potential as the fourier transform ( [ e2]-[a1 ] ) , we need the transition operators at any value of @xmath105 . since the argument of the spherical bessel function in the operator is @xmath106 , the dependence on @xmath105 and r of the multipole @xmath107 will not factorize .",
    "therefore there would be no factorization of the time and r dependence in the coupling potential .",
    "however , in the limit of long wavelengths , the first term in expression ( [ m2 ] ) reduces to the well - known static electric multipole operator , @xmath108 which does not depend on @xmath105 . in a similar way",
    ", the general magnetic operator @xmath109 in the limit of long wavelengths , becomes @xmath110 that means that , in the limit of long wavelengths , neither the electric nor the magnetic transition operators depend on @xmath105 ( we will therefore omit @xmath105 in the arguments of @xmath111 ) and they will come out of the integral in  ( [ e2 ] ) . we just need to know @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath114 is an analytic function whose explicit expression can be found in the appendix .    therefore , in the long wavelength limit , the following analytic expression of the time dependent coupling potential @xmath115 can be explicitly derived . from the use of the static multipole operators",
    "has followed that any of the term in the sum factorize into two elements , the first one depending on collisions properties , the second one acting on the nucleus being excited .",
    "if one considers only the electric components , which are the most important , only natural parity states can be excited in a first order calculation . however , in a coupled channel calculation , as the present one , non natural parity states have to be included since they can be reached , for example , through a two step process .",
    "however we will see in the following that these contributions remain small .    we want to have a feeling about the limits that the use of the static electric operator imposes on the interpretation of our results .",
    "if a first - order harmonic and linear calculation was to be done , we could just compare the complete matrix elements @xmath116 and the approximate one @xmath117 .",
    "the matrix elements connecting the ground state with one phonon states are consistent within a maximum of a few per thousand for low - lying states , and differ by a few percent when the gdr or the isgqr are considered .",
    "[ h ]    in a coupled - channel calculation not just a fixed @xmath118 , but the full range of @xmath105 values will contribute to the fourier transform ( [ e1]- [ a1 ] ) .",
    "as an illustration , let us consider the colliding system @xmath0pb+@xmath0pb at e@xmath119= 641 mev to compare the exact multipole expansion with the long wavelength limit .",
    "the associated time - dependent transition matrices from the ground state to the giant dipole resonance , @xmath120 , are presented in figure [ fg1 ] for the magnetic quantum number @xmath121 and in figure [ fg2 ] for @xmath122 for two different values of the impact parameter .",
    "the solid lines correspond to calculations in which the general expression of the electric multipole operator has been taken into account , and the inverse fourier transform of the corresponding amplitude has been carried on numerically .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the use of the static electric operator and the analytic expression ( [ multi ] ) .",
    "we can see that qualitatively the time dependence is well reproduced , while the quantitative agreement gets better as the impact parameters increases .",
    "that is essentially due to the adiabatic cutoff that the modified bessel function @xmath123 introduces .",
    "this function decays exponentially when the argument becomes bigger than 2  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the impact parameter increases the relevant range of @xmath105 in the integral is reduced and we get closer to the long wavelength limit expression for the interacting potential .",
    "this effect can be seen in figure [ fg3 ] where the behaviour with the impact parameter of @xmath124 is presented at t=0 .",
    "this is the time at which the difference between both approaches is maximum when @xmath125 is even .",
    "a similar behaviour is found when the matrix elements @xmath55 or @xmath56 are considered .",
    "the conclusion of this study is that , in the excitation energy region we will consider , it is reasonable to use the static electric operator .",
    "this amounts to a considerable saving of calculations since , for each multipole , the time and the r dependence factorize .",
    "let us now apply the above formalism to a specific nucleus , namely the @xmath0pb excited in a collision with a pb nucleus at 641 mev per nucleon .",
    "we will first discuss the effect of the anharmonicities on the rpa spectrum .",
    "secondly , we will look at the effect of non - linear terms in the external field .",
    "finally , we will consider the influence of both these terms on the excitation probability and the cross sections .",
    "the one - phonon basis is calculated in the self - consistent rpa with sgii skyrme interaction @xcite .",
    "although we are using an explicit neutron proton representation the isospin results to be a rather good quantum number as far as collective states are concerned .",
    "we have selected all the states which exhaust at least @xmath126 of the appropriate ewsr and , for a particular spin and parity ( and isospin ) , we have grouped together the ones which are closer in energy according to the method described in ref .",
    "we have considered the one - phonon states reported in table [ fpb ] , i.e. the various components of the isoscalar monopole resonance ( gmr ) , the components of the isovector dipole resonance @xmath127 , the low - lying @xmath128 state and the quadrupole resonances , both isoscalar ( isgqr ) and isovector ( ivgqr ) , and finally the collective low - lying @xmath129 and high - lying @xmath130 isoscalar octupole states .    .",
    "one - phonon basis for the nucleus @xmath0pb . for each state",
    "its spin and parity , isospin , energy and percentage of the ewsr are reported . [",
    "cols=\">,^,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have employed an rpa based approach to compute the anharmonicities : we have diagonalized the residual interaction between rpa phonons in the space of one- and two - phonons states .",
    "we have taken into account also the particle - particle and hole - hole terms in the external field making possible the direct excitation of two - phonon states as well as the transition between one - phonon states .",
    "these non - linear terms and the anharmonicities are not taken into account in the `` standard '' approach of the multiphonon picture . within this framework",
    "we have calculated the coulomb excitation of @xmath0pb and @xmath1ca nuclei due to the impinging @xmath0pb nucleus at 641 and 1000 mev / a .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the inclusion of both anharmonicities and non - linear terms in the external field reduce the disagreement between the experimental cross section in the dgdr region and the theoretical one calculated within the `` standard '' approach . moreover , for the @xmath0pb case , we have found a big effect also at low energy where the @xmath131 state would have never been excited without the presence of both the anharmonicities and non - linearities .",
    "since these low lying two - phonon states are strongly mixed and since their energy is low , we believe that they could also be strongly excited by the nuclear part of the mean field at an incident energy lower than the one considered here",
    ". theoretical and experimental work in this direction are called for .    in view of our calculations",
    "it is clear that non - linearities and anharmonicities have an influence on the coulomb excitation . on some particular states",
    "this influence can be very strong , while averaging over all the states we have found an increase of the cross section by about 10% for pb and 20% for ca in the region of the two - phonon states while the energies were modified only by a few percent",
    ". however , this might not be the final answer because of different reasons .",
    "first , we are working in a truncated subspace in order to keep only one- and two- phonon states .",
    "however , we know that a large part of the increase observed in ref . @xcite is due to the increase of transition matrix elements coming from components of the wave function containing large phonon numbers . these components are not taken into account in the present calculation and this reduces the influence of anharmonicities .",
    "in fact we have tested this point on the simple model reported in reference @xcite and we have observed that a truncation of the multiphonon space at the two - phonon level reduces the increase of the cross section by almost a factor 4 .",
    "unfortunately , this point is not easy to improve because the computation time will become too long if we are forced to include more multiphonon states .",
    "we are now trying to develop an alternative approach based on time - dependent mean field theory in the boson representation .",
    "the anharmonicities we are computing are mainly due to the residual interaction into channels which are different from the usual particle - hole interaction .",
    "one may argue that , as far as effective interactions are concerned , their parameters are only fitted close to the ground state",
    ". therefore , except for the particle - hole channel the other parts of the interaction are not really constrained by the theory .",
    "however , in some cases the residual interaction has been tested far from the ground state . in this respect",
    "the relative success of the time - dependent mean field theory ( and other treatments such as adiabatic tdhf or generator coordinate method ) might be an indication that the same skyrme parametrisation also holds for large amplitude motion .",
    "however , this point is certainly calling for more theoretical developments in order to better define the effective interaction in channels different from the standard particle - hole ones .    from the experimental point of view",
    "it seems that the @xmath0pb nucleus behaves as a rather good vibrator .",
    "in fact the discrepancy about the cross - section between theory and experiment is apparently much smaller in the case of pb than in the case of xe @xcite .",
    "moreover , as far as the shift in energy of the two - phonon state with respect to the harmonic limit is concerned , a shift of less than 1% was found experimentally for pb while for xe it was of the order of 10% @xcite . in our calculation",
    "the pb also appears as a rather good vibrator and the predicted effects on the energy shifts are consistent with the experiment .",
    "this is probably related to the fact that @xmath0pb is a double - magic nucleus .",
    "it would be very important to study non - magic , open - shell or deformed nuclei which are expected to be poorer vibrators than double - magic nuclei .",
    "in particular , it is known that the energy of the gdr is strongly affected by the deformation , indicating a possible strong coupling between dipole and quadrupole degrees of freedom .",
    "this may induce a modification of the cross - section stronger than the predicted 10 % to 20% for spherical - magic nuclei . in this respect ,",
    "extensions of the presented results to open shell and deformed nuclei are called for .    in conclusion",
    ", we would like to stress that in addition to the dgdr excitation several states are contributing to the cross - section in the dgdr energy region .",
    "when the non - linearities and the anharmonicities are taken into account the total theoretical cross - section above the ivgqr come rather close to the experimental result for the coulomb excitation of pb .",
    "we just need to know      with @xmath113 , since @xmath133 . considering the cases @xmath134",
    "even or odd , together with t positive , negative or null , the integral ( [ e3 ] ) will be proportional to integrals in @xcite . combining all cases we get          if @xmath125 is even , then @xmath137 and @xmath138 . whereas if @xmath125 is odd , then @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , in the cases in which we are interested @xmath141 is an integer @xmath142 , and the latter hypergeometric function reduces to the following polynomial        a. bohr and b.r .",
