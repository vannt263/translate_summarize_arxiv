    "<S> we see that the data in @xmath93 at both energies of @xmath94 gev and @xmath95 gev , @xmath96 at @xmath95 gev , and @xmath87 again at @xmath95 gev can already be described relatively well by the nonresonant contribution only and do not need strong modification from a resonance . </S>",
    "<S> however , the rest of the distributions show some discrepancies between nonresonant contribution and experimental data and the inclusion of resonant contribution does help to reduce the discrepancies . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially true for @xmath96 at @xmath95 gev and @xmath87 at @xmath97 gev , where the nonresonant contribution does not describe satisfactorily the experimental data . for </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath98 and @xmath89 , our model still fail to give adequate agreement with the data which are of rather poor quality with large error bars .    </S>",
    "<S> one might be tempted to identify the @xmath82 as the @xmath6 as listed in pdg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constants given table [ tab : nstar- ] can be used to calculate the ratio of the helicity amplitudes @xmath99 and @xmath100 , though not their magnitudes since only the product of the coupling constants for @xmath101 and @xmath102 are determined . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a value of @xmath103 , while it is @xmath104 for @xmath6 . even though their magnitudes are similar , the relative sign is , however , different . for @xmath105 , we find that the value of @xmath106 , again with positive sign </S>",
    "<S> .    since the resonance proposed here is obtained by fitting to the existing data , a critical check would be to see whether additional data would substantiate our interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we also calculate the predictions of our model with and without the inclusion of the proposed resonance for all the polarization observables @xcite . in general , we find that the effects of the resonance are substantial in many of the polarization observables @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> [ omega ] , it is seen that the prediction of their model for the @xmath9-dependence of differential cross section at @xmath122 gev , given in solid lines , still exhibits substantial discrepancy with the most recent experimental data @xcite for @xmath124 gev@xmath125 . by adding resonance postulated here to the model of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with @xmath126 , whose prediction is given in the dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ omega ] , we see that the differential cross section at @xmath122 gev can be reproduced with roughly the correct strength . </S>",
    "<S> the large value of @xmath127 would imply that the resonance we propose here contains a considerable amount of strangeness content .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have explored the possibility of accounting for the nonmonotonic behavior as observed by the leps collaboration at energies close to threshold as a manifestation of a resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out calculations using a model with a nonresonant contribution which consists of pomeron plus @xmath9-channel @xmath128-exchange amplitudes , and a resonant contribution . </S>",

    "<S> we confirm that nonresonant contribution alone can not describe the nonmonotonic behavior of the forward differential cross section near threshold and the @xmath9-dependence of the differential cross section @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the addition of a resonance with @xmath131 of either positive or negative parity can not explain the local maximum at around @xmath13 gev . </S>",
    "<S> however , with an assignment of @xmath132 , a nice agreement with most of the leps data can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> we prefer the choice of @xmath133 as the best fit to the data since its results are more stable with respect to changes in the low - energy pomeron parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained resonance mass and width are @xmath3 and @xmath4 gev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting coupling constants give rise to a ratio of the helicity amplitudes @xmath134 , which differs from that of the known @xmath6 in sign .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the postulated resonance gives substantial contribution to the polarization observables , which can also be used to determine the parity of the resonance if it indeed exists .    </S>",
    "<S> the possible effects of this postulated resonance in the @xmath7 photoproduction are investigated by incorporating it within a recent calculation @xcite for this reaction . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the addition of our resonance , with a choice of a large value of ozi - evading parameter @xmath8 , could indeed considerably improve the agreement of the model prediction with the most recent data . </S>",
    "<S> that would imply the resonance postulated here does contain considerable amount of strangeness content .    </S>",
    "<S> there are a few caveats in our study . </S>",
    "<S> the first concerns the low - energy pomeron parameters which are not presently very precisely determined . </S>",
    "<S> if the postulated resonance contains considerable amount of strangeness , then it could couple strongly to , say , @xmath135 channel . </S>",
    "<S> question would then arise on how the coupled - channel effects would modify the low - energy behavior of the nonresonant amplitude employed in this investigation . </S>",
    "<S> this can be answered only with a full coupled - channel calculations as carried out in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another question is the validity of our assumption to account for the local maximum with just one resonance . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in the calculation of the effects of our postulated resonance , some discrepancies with the recent data still persist after the addition of this resonance . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , our study may have raised more questions than it answers . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , further studies , both experimentally and theoretically , are needed on the @xmath0-meson photoproduction at low energies . </S>"
