    "in bernstein , freedman & madore ( 2002a , b , c ; hereafter , bfm1 , bfm2 and bfm3 , respectively ) , we described a measurement of the mean flux of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) in a @xmath6 arcmin@xmath7 field of view . in that study ,",
    "the ebl contribution was identified by measuring the total flux in the target field and subtracting from it the flux contributed by known foreground sources , namely diffuse galactic light ( dgl ) and zodiacal light ( zl ) : @xmath8 the total flux , @xmath9 , was measured from space using hst / wfpc2 imaging in the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12bands and using hst / fos spectroscopy covering roughly 40007000 .",
    "the zodiacal light , @xmath13 , was measured using ground  based spectrophotometry obtained at the du pont 2.5  m telescope at las campanas observatory ( lco ) in chile .",
    "the diffuse galactic light , @xmath14 , was estimated from a simple scattering model .",
    "the ebl values at 3000 , 5500 , and 8000  were measured to be 4.0 ( @xmath02.5 ) , 2.7 ( @xmath01.4 ) , and 2.2 ( @xmath01.0 ) @xmath15 ergs sec@xmath2 @xmath3 sr@xmath2 @xmath2 , respectively .    the zodiacal light measurement , described in bfm2 , is the only part of the experiment involving ground  based observations .",
    "the earth s atmosphere influences these observations through absorption , scattering , and airglow emission . absorption and scattering cause `` extinction '' of the light in the target field ; scattering causes a fraction of the light from the full , visible hemisphere of the sky to be added to the line of sight ; and airglow is an additive foreground source produced in the atmosphere .",
    "the resulting night  sky spectrum observed from the ground ( @xmath16 ) was therefore described as a function of time(@xmath17 ) , airmass ( @xmath18 ) , atmospheric extinction ( @xmath19 ) , and wavelength ( @xmath20 ) , as follows ( equation 3 of bfm2 ) : @xmath21 in which @xmath22 is the spectrum of light scattered into the line of sight and @xmath23 is the airglow spectrum . to measure the zodiacal light in our experiment , we utilized the fact that the zodiacal light is known to have a slightly  reddened solar spectrum in which the solar  strength fraunhofer lines are preserved .",
    "the zodiacal light contamination can therefore be expressed as the product of a fiducial solar spectrum , @xmath24 , and a scaling function , @xmath25 , that varies roughly linearly with wavelength .",
    "the airglow spectrum , on the other hand , is not known to contain fraunhofer features .",
    "we therefore identified the zl flux by iteratively determining the scaling factor , @xmath25 , for which the resulting residual airglow spectrum has the minimum correlation with the solar spectrum .",
    "we expressed the airglow spectrum as @xmath26,\\ ] ] in which the term @xmath27 accounts for zl flux lost from the beam due to extinction and the scattered light term , @xmath22 , includes zl , isl ( integrated star light ) , and dgl ( diffuse galactic light ) as contaminating sources .",
    "as discussed in bfm2 , we then needed a model for each scattering source over the visible spectrum in order to calculate the scattered light . to eliminate the absolute flux of the zl from the models",
    ", we expressed the scattered light from all sources as a fraction of the zl in the target field , as implied by equation 3 .",
    "we then combined the net zl loss due to extinction with net zl gain due to scattering to give an effective extinction , @xmath28 .",
    "this let us express the effect of the atmosphere on the zl as a relative ( multiplicative ) correction .",
    "the absolute value of the isl , dgl , and ebl remain in the calculation .",
    "however , the ebl and dgl terms were then dropped because they were not expected to have fraunhofer features and so were not expected to impact the spectral measurement based on the strength of these features .. ] we therefore identified the zl flux ( expressed as @xmath29 ) according to the equation : @xmath30.\\ ] ]    we correct errors in our ( 2002 ) papers regarding the dates of the las campanas observatory ( lco ) observations , a statement regarding the location of the moon on those dates , and quantify the implications of these corrections .",
    "we also include a discussion of analysis errors which pertains to all unrefereed work prior to the ( 2002 ) papers ( bernstein , freedman , & madore 1996 ; bernstein & madore 1997 ; bernstein 1998phdt ; bernstein 1999a ; bernstein 1999b ) ; these were corrected before publication of bfm2 and lead to no corrections here .",
    "some of these errors were noted by mattila ( 2003 ) .",
    "we adopt nomenclature consistent with that of our earlier work to allow clear discussion of what was done there . throughout this paper , we abbreviate @xmath31 ergs sec@xmath2 @xmath3 sr@xmath2 @xmath2 as cgs .",
    "mattila ( 2003 ) has correctly noted that the analysis of the ground  based data as detailed in the unpublished thesis ( bernstein 1998 ) contained an incorrect treatment of atmospheric effects . in that early analysis ,",
    "atmospheric scattering was not included as a contribution to the observed night sky spectrum .",
    "in addition , due to a programming error in a subroutine , an incorrect extinction correction was applied .",
    "the incorrect treatment of atmospheric scattering was identified by the referee and both errors were corrected before publication . in the unpublished thesis ,",
    "prior to the correction of these two errors , the zl was therefore calculated based on the following expression ( compare to equation 4 above ) : @xmath32\\chi}.\\ ] ] over the wavelength range used in that analysis ( 42005100 ) and at the mean airmass of our observations ( @xmath33 1.2 ) , the exponential term in equation 5 has values between 0.93 and 1.06 , with an average value of 1.00 . in effect , the data were analyzed with no scattering correction and an incorrect extinction correction .    in brief , the analysis in bernstein ( 1998 ) involved preparing solar spectra appropriate to each observation using iraf routines to resample in wavelength , and apply an extinction curve for the airmass of each observation .",
    "the zodiacal light solution is then a scaling value relative to these prepared fiducial solar spectra .",
    "the solar spectra , corrected for extinction , were compared with the corresponding lco spectra to find the contribution of zodiacal light .",
    "these solar spectra were produced many times in the course of data reduction , because the extinction and sensitivity solutions were recalculated many times . a check was therefore included in a subroutine to confirm that the solar spectra were correctly prepared .",
    "that check involved multiplying the solar spectrum by @xmath34 $ ] with @xmath35 mag / airmass , roughly removing the extinction correction .",
    "the error then occurred by passing the wrong vector back to the main program from the subroutine .",
    "the programming error was not identified until the anonymous referee pointed out the incorrect treatment of atmospheric scattering . for completeness",
    ", we note that figure 4.4 in bernstein ( 1998 ) does not show the final extinction solution used in the thesis . the correct extinction solution used in all versions",
    "is shown in bfm2 .",
    "table 2.9 in bernstein ( 1998 ) , which lists values for @xmath9 , was also updated in the published papers .    when properly treated , the scattering and extinction are nearly equal in magnitude but opposite in sign , and so they cancel to a high degree ( to about 0.5% averaged over wavelength and airmass ) , giving the same result as the original analysis to within the accuracy of the measurements",
    ". the cancellation of the scattering and extinction terms in the proper analysis can be seen in the following quantitative example . at 4600  and at our mean airmass ( as given above ) , the extinction coefficient ( figure 29 of bfm2 ) is @xmath36  mag / airmass and , accordingly , @xmath37 $ ] = 0.955 . over the spectral range 39005100and at the same airmass ,",
    "the net flux gained from scattered isl is in the range 1017 cgs . at 4600 ,",
    "the isl scattered flux is 12.5 cgs .",
    "the isl contribution impacts our zl measurement to the degree that it contributes to the strength of the fraunhofer lines in the observed night sky spectrum ; however , those features are only 10% to 40% as strong in the scattered isl as in the zl over the range 39005100 , and 30% to 40% as strong around 4600  ( see figures 29 and 30 of bfm2 ) .",
    "the scattered isl therefore contributes + 4.4 cgs ( = 12.5 cgs @xmath38 0.35 ) to the solution , or @xmath39 ( given that @xmath13 is roughly 110 cgs . )",
    "the term in square brackets in equation 4 is therefore nearly unity ( 0.995 for this example ) . at higher airmasses and shorter wavelengths , scattered flux ( @xmath40 ) and extinction ( @xmath41 ) both increase . at smaller airmasses and longer wavelengths",
    ", they both decrease . in either case , the term in square brackets in equation 4 is still nearly unity .",
    "in other words , the net loss due to extinction and the net gain due to scattering are synchronized and cancel to a level that is much smaller than the uncertainty in identifying the zl flux contribution in the 16 spectra used in this analysis , which have an _ rms _ scatter of 2.3% .",
    "because of this cancellation , statistically indistinguishable results were obtained in the early ( bernstein 1998 ) and published ( bfm2 ) versions of the analysis .",
    "note that the similarity between the net effects of atmospheric scattering and extinction alone are coincidental , and would likely not occur along lines of sight where the zl in the target field is much brighter or fainter .",
    "they are also , of course , dependent on the parameters used to calculate the scattering model , which are documented explicitly in bfm2 .    in the early analysis ,",
    "no change in @xmath25 with wavelength was detected because the incorrect extinction correction masked the reddening of the zl relative to the sun . because no color term was detected , several broad bandpasses were used . in the published version , an increase in @xmath25 with wavelength was identified , consistent with the reddened color of the zl relative to the solar spectrum .",
    "narrow bandpasses focused on the solar features were then used to help identify this trend .",
    "the dates of the ground  based observations were incorrectly recorded in the unpublished thesis and were subsequently transcribed by rab from there into the published papers .",
    "the original observing logs and the records of the observatory show that the correct dates of the run were the local  time nights of 23/24 november 1995 through 27/28 november 1995 ( 5 nights total ) .",
    "the last night of the run was used for imaging .",
    "data from the first and third nights were not used due to weather and mechanical problems , as described in bernstein ( 1998 ) and bfm2 .",
    "the spectra cited and analyzed in bfm2 were therefore taken on nights 2 and 4 of the run , having local  time dates 24/25 and 26/27 november 1995 .",
    "the corresponding ut dates were 25 and 27 november 1995 .",
    "the incorrect dates affect the application of the zodiacal light measurement to the hst observations at the level of 0.2% ( although with significant uncertainty ) and also affect the scattering calculations at the level of @xmath42% .",
    "we describe and quantify these two effects below .",
    "the hst observations analyzed in bfm1 were executed on the ut nights of 29 november 1995 and 1617 december 1995 . ground ",
    "based observations were assigned and scheduled by the time allocation committee about one year earlier .",
    "as stated in the abstract of bfm1 , the observations were designed to occur contemporaneously with one of the sets of hst observations , but they were not executed simultaneously .",
    "to get an idea what the change in the zl value might be between our lco observations on 25/27 november 1995 and the hst observations on 29 november 1995 , we can look at data in the literature and our own hst data . from 29 november 1995 to 16/17 december 1995 , the hst / wfpc2 and fos data _ both _ showed a @xmath43% decrease in the mean surface brightness of the ebl target field . as discussed in bfm1 and bfm2",
    ", this difference is what would be expected in sign and magnitude as the heliocentric longitude ( @xmath44 ) of the target field goes from about @xmath45 on 29 november 1995 to @xmath46 on 16/17 december 1995 .",
    "one expects this small decrease in intensity because the zl is slightly brighter in the anti - solar direction ( @xmath47 ) and has a broad minimum at @xmath48 .    for comparison ,",
    "several data sets are available in the literature .",
    "the only all  sky measurements of the zl surface brightness are from the ground . of these ,",
    "the most reliable are those tabulated by levasseur ",
    "regourd & dumont ( 1980 , hereafter lrd80 ) from their 19641975 observations at tenerife observatory .",
    "that data set is reproduced in leinert et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , where it is updated with space  based values within 30 degrees of the sun . although these data are ground  based and subject to scattering corrections , they are in good agreement with space  based results , as discussed in lrd80 , leinert et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and bfm2 . between @xmath49 and @xmath46 and ecliptic latitude @xmath50 ,",
    "the data tabulated in lrd80 show a 6% change in the zl flux . at these latitudes , data are also available from several other sources . as compared and discussed in leinert et al .",
    "( 1981 ) and leinert et al .  1998 ) , frey et al .",
    "( 1970 ) find a change of about @xmath51% over these same angles , and the helios space probes ( leinert et al .",
    "1981 , leinert et al .  1982 ) find a change of 1% .",
    "these three published results are in good agreement to within the errors of any of the measurements , which are of order 510% .",
    "to be conservative in estimating the change in the zl between 29 november 1995 and 16/17 december 1995 , we simply average the values discussed above ( 2% , 6% , @xmath51% , 1% ) to obtain 1.7% with a standard deviation of 3.3%",
    ". as the errors are probably systematic , the standard deviation may be more indicative of the uncertainty than the error in the mean .",
    "we then estimate that the change in the zodiacal light between 25/27 november lco observations ( @xmath44 = 153 and 151 ) and 29 november for hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations ( @xmath44 = 149 ) should be @xmath52% ( i.e. , slightly _ fainter _ on the 29th ) . to conservatively allow for any systematic uncertainties between the data sets , we double this error bar to @xmath53% .",
    "we include this offset in the summary in table 2 .      because of the transcription error in the dates of the observations ,",
    "the scattering calculations in bfm2 were performed for the wrong date , namely the 29th rather than the 25th and 27th of november 1995 .",
    "the sky visible at a particular ut time shifts by roughly one degree per day .",
    "however , the target field and all sources of scattering obviously move in consort , so that the scattering calculated for a given zenith angle of the target is correct on any date .",
    "the one source which does not move in consort is the moon ; however , any spectrum affected by moonlight should not be included in the analysis ( see  [ moon ] ) , and so the moon is not included in the calculation of scattered light from extraterrestrial sources . the only change in the scattering calculations between november 25 , 27 , and 29 is therefore caused by the fact that the target field will rise 4 minutes earlier on each successive night .",
    "the scattering calculations for ut=2:00 on november 29 are therefore correct for ut=2:16 on november 25 , and ut=2:08 on november 23 .",
    "the net change in the scattered zl and isl for the largest difference in timing ( 16 minutes ) is very small .",
    "moreover , as illustrated in  2 , the net effect of the atmosphere ( scattering and extinction of zl , and scattering of isl ) nearly cancels at every zenith angle .",
    "for that reason , the change over 8 or 16 minutes is not detectable .    to illustrate this quantitatively",
    ", we note that the mean change in the effective extinction ( figure 25 , bfm2 ) is smaller by an average of 0.0013 mag / airmass between a given ut time and 16 minutes earlier .",
    "this translates into a fractional change of 0.03 in @xmath41 . using the mean airmass , @xmath54",
    ", this corresponds to an increase in the net zl by a factor of 1.0015 .",
    "as the scattered isl gets brighter with increasing ut time , the scattered isl would be correspondingly fainter by about 4% over that same time period ( 16 minutes earlier ) , and would decrease the strength of the isl spectral features by the factor 0.998 (= @xmath55 12.5 cgs/@xmath13 ) .",
    "the net change with time is then 0.998@xmath381.0015 @xmath56 0.9995 , which is not significant .",
    "nevertheless , for completeness , we list this term , and all other corrections discussed here in the summary in table 2 .",

    "each night , as the moon was setting , the open  dome time was used to observe bright , standard stars for calibration .",
    "observations of the ebl target field began as the moon approached the horizon .",
    "the general , but quantitative , statement in bfm2 that the moon was at least @xmath83 degrees below the horizon during all but one exposure is incorrect .",
    "the correct statement is that one exposure that was used in the analysis began as the moon was still setting ( ut = 03:10 on 27",
    "november 1995 ) ; all other exposures used in the analysis were taken with the moon below the horizon by several degrees .",
    "the times of the first few exposures and the corresponding position of the moon during those exposures are given in table 1 for all spectra taken until the moon was more than 22 degrees below the horizon on november 25 and 27 .",
    "the spectra from these exposures are plotted in figure 1 .    because of its high mean flux level , it was clear to us that the exposure beginning at ut = 02:37 ( open square in figure 1 ) was affected by moonlight and for that reason it was not used in the analysis in bfm2 .",
    "the moon contributes exponentially less light with time after passing below the horizon ( like the sun at sunset ) .",
    "the remaining exposures were not obviously affected and were therefore included in the subsequent analysis .",
    "we now consider what the impact of the moon might have been on the included spectra .    to obtain a theoretical estimate of the scattered moonlight which might influence each exposure , we can use the scattering model described in bfm2 .",
    "these estimates are given in table 1 as a fraction of the zl flux in the target field .",
    "simpler models for moonlight sky brightness , such as that implemented by skycalc.v5 ( thorstensen 2001 ) , give consistent values at zenith angles smaller than about @xmath84 , but yield higher values for the sky brightness very near the horizon .",
    "( these models do not predict the moonlight below the horizon .",
    "see krisciunas & schaefer ( 1991 ) for a discussion of the model implemented in skycalc.v5 and its uncertainties . ) for the lunar phase and angular distance of the target from the moon ( @xmath85 on 27 nov .",
    "1995 ) , the estimated moonlight flux is negligible ( @xmath86% ) by the time the moon reaches a zenith angle of @xmath87 .    we can also obtain an empirical estimate of the scattered moonlight in each exposure by simply comparing their mean fluxes . for the exposure beginning at ut = 02:37 ( which was clearly affected by moonlight and was _ not _ used in the analysis ) , the scattered moonlight is estimated to be about @xmath88 at 4600 . the zl accounts for roughly two thirds of the night sky flux ( see figure 9 , bfm2 ) , so that this spectrum is predicted to be about 40% brighter due to moonlight than spectra taken later .",
    "this is generally consistent with the empirical mean flux of the spectrum , which appears to be about 43% brighter than later spectra ( open square , figure 1 ) .",
    "for the exposure beginning at ut = 03:10 ( 27 nov . 1995 ) , the scattered moonlight is estimated to be @xmath89 , implying that the mean flux for this spectrum should be about 8% higher than later spectra .",
    "the flux of this spectrum appears to be about 5% higher than the mean ( open circle , figure 1 ) , which is again generally consistent to within the accuracy of the scattering models at very high airmasses .",
    "note also that there is about 5% peak  to  peak variation in the mean flux of spectra that are not influenced by moonlight .",
    "this is presumably due to changes in atmospheric effects ( changes in airglow , changes in extinction with airmass , and changes in scattered starlight and diffuse galactic light ) .",
    "for this reason , the spectrum at ut=03:10 did not obviously appear to be problematic .",
    "we conclude from the predicted and empirical fluxes of the spectra discussed above that the spectrum taken at ut=03:10 was probably affected by moonlight , and so we recalculate the final result without it .",
    "the zl value derived from that exposure alone is @xmath90 ( 1@xmath91 ) , which is about 34% higher than the mean ( see figures 12 & 13 , bfm2 ) . excluding this data point , the final zl result ( based on the average of 16 observations ) is lower by 0.3% , which is roughly 1/2 the quoted statistical uncertainty and 1/4 the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the effect of excluding this exposure from the analysis is included in the summary in table 2 .",
    "we have presented corrections to the published results ( bfm1,2,3 ) , including the dates of the ground  based observations , the location of the moon during each exposure , and the quantitative impact of these corrections .",
    "in addition , we have explicitly documented corrections made to the analysis between the unpublished thesis ( bernstein 1998 ) and published versions of this work ( bfm2 ) . the measured value of the zl decreases by 0.5(@xmath00.6)% , or 0.5(@xmath00.6 cgs ) as a result of these changes . for comparison ,",
    "the quoted measurement uncertainties in bfm2 are 0.6% , statistical , and 1.1% , systematic .",
    "the inferred ebl increases correspondingly by @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 cgs in the @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath12bands . for comparison ,",
    "the quoted @xmath5 uncertainties in each band were 2.5 , 1.4 , and 1.0 cgs , respectively .",
