    "squeezed states of the radiation field are those in which the field fluctuations in one of the quadratures are reduced below the vacuum noise level .",
    "they were among the first nonclassical states of light generated experimentally @xcite in the 1980s , and were considered promising as a way of overcoming the shot - noise precision restrictions in optical measurements @xcite and enhancing the capacity of communication channels @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the interest to generate squeezed light is mainly due to its applicability in quantum information and communication . in this context",
    "it is viewed primarily as a means of generating quadrature entanglement @xcite , a valuable resource that can be applied , for example , for quantum teleportation @xcite , computation @xcite , cryptography @xcite and manipulation of atomic quantum states @xcite .",
    "there has been also a theoretical effort towards developing protocols for the continuous - variable error correction @xcite and entanglement purification @xcite .",
    "furthermore , operations that enable entanglement distillation in the continuous - variable domain have been described @xcite .",
    "the present paper concentrates on one experimental method for producing optical squeezing , namely an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) , implementing degenerate parametric down - conversion in a single - pass , pulsed configuration . a strong pump pulse propagating through a nonlinear crystal generates pairs of down - converted photons .",
    "the idealized experimental arrangement would be such that the photons in each generated pair are completely indistinguishable and contribute to the same spatio - temporal mode of the generated field .",
    "a combination of a high pump pulse energy and high optical nonlinearity leads to multiple pair creation events , which can be described in the heisenberg picture as a linear transformation between the field operators at the input @xmath0 and the output @xmath1 of the amplifier : @xmath2 when the initial state of the field is vacuum , the above equation defines a squeezed state with the degree of squeezing @xmath3 , corresponding to the mean square quadrature noise scaling factor equal to @xmath4 . a crucial assumption underlying eq .",
    "( [ sqop ] ) , frequently used in theoretical works , is that all the down - converted photons are emitted to a single mode described by the annihilation operator @xmath1 .",
    "however , this does not correspond to a realistic experimental situation .    in an experiment , pulsed squeezed light was realized for the first time by slusher et al .",
    "@xcite and has since been reproduced and improved by a number of researchers @xcite . in all these experiments ,",
    "a pulsed laser is first frequency doubled and then undergoes parametric down - conversion in a spatially- and spectrally - degenerate type i configuration . the generated optical state is then characterized by means of homodyne detection .",
    "in contrast to the continuous - wave regime , the pulsed squeezed mode does not associate with a sideband of the carrier wave , but is localized within the temporal frame of the pump laser pulse @xcite .",
    "this appealing feature is however compromised by a complex spectral structure of the generated photon pairs . in single",
    "- pass down - conversion , biphotons are emitted not necessarily into a particular mode , but into a wide range of modes restricted only by the energy - conservation and phase - matching conditions .",
    "the usual absence of a dominant spatio - temporal mode can lead to difficulties when we attempt to observe quantum interference of the generated squeezed vacuum with other classical or nonclassical optical states .",
    "the negative effects range from efficiency reduction in homodyne detection to extra dark counts in single photon measurements .",
    "the present paper is dedicated to studying the spectral mode of the pulsed squeezed state .",
    "a particular question we aim to answer is the following : can we define a particular mode in which high - efficiency squeezing is achieved ?",
    "are there methods to engineer this mode and what are the most efficient ways to access it in homodyne measurements ?",
    "the arguments given in the previous paragraph may lead one to believe that there is no mode in which high - efficiency squeezing is present .",
    "surprisingly , we demonstrate just the opposite : we find modes in which pure squeezed states are generated , and also a whole continuum of their phase - locked superpositions turns out to become efficiently squeezed .",
    "in fact , good squeezing is present in a broad , continuous range of pulsed modes that are temporally synchronized with the pump",
    ". the basic theoretical tool in our analysis will be the bloch - messiah reduction of an arbitrary bogoliubov transformation of bosonic field operators @xcite .",
    "this procedure will allow us to identify a set of independent squeezing modes whose evolution takes a simple form analogous to eq .",
    "( [ sqop ] ) .",
    "such a decomposition results directly from the preservation of the commutation relations between the field operators in course of the parametric evolution .",
    "this fact allows us to apply the numerical technique of singular - value decomposition to integral kernels describing the transformation of the field operators , which provides effective means to analyze a realistic parametric amplifier .",
    "the decomposition into independent squeezers has been given previously by bennik and boyd @xcite , who deduced it using intricate operator algebraic methods @xcite .",
    "as a physical example , we analyse one - dimensional propagation in a beta - barium borate ( bbo ) crystal serving as a model of a waveguide amplifier .",
    "the nonlinearity of a bbo crystal has an instantaneous character @xcite , as this medium is transparent from infrared to ultraviolet and we find that the downconversion spectrum is limited by the dispersion across the signal frequencies .",
    "this differs from the example studied in ref .",
    "@xcite which assumed noninstantaneous second - order nonlinearity leading to limited downconversion spectrum , while the dispersion within the bandwidth of down - converted frequencies was neglected .",
    "also , we discuss in detail the perturbative regime of weak conversion efficiency which provides intuitive insights into the structure of squeezing building on previous results obtained for spectral two - photon wave functions @xcite . we also show that the characteristic squeezing modes of a parametric amplifier provide a general answer to the question of optimizing the local oscillator shape in homodyne measurements @xcite .",

    ", we will focus here on the one - dimensional case that can be realized in non - linear waveguides @xcite , which recently have become available commercially .",
    "the one - dimensional case nevertheless includes all the complexities of multimode propagation in the spectral degree of freedom , and the generalization of the formalism introduced here to the full three - dimensional case is straightforward .",
    "if the pump field is strong enough to neglect its depletion as well as fluctuations , the propagation equations in the heisenberg picture become linear in the signal field .",
    "following the standard nonlinear optics description of the evolution of the fields with respect to the distance covered rather than time , we shall adopt the modal decomposition of the electric field operator in the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the permittivity of the vacuum , @xmath7 is the refractive index of the medium at a given frequency and polarization direction , @xmath8 is the annihilation operator of a monochromatic mode at a given propagation stage indicated by @xmath9 . we have neglected the dependence of the field on transverse coordinates , as we concentrate here on the one - dimensional case of a waveguide .",
    "the quantization of the classical propagation equations of the three - wave mixing problem @xcite is done by a formal substitution of classical amplitudes by field operators .",
    "this yields a first - order differential equation for annihilation operators @xmath10 of the form : @xmath11 where the first term on the right - hand side represents the free propagation of the field in the medium , while the second one represents nonlinear interaction . in the above expression",

    "for all calculations in this paper , @xmath12 is assumed real and positive , i.e. the pump pulse is prepared so that in the middle of the waveguide it is not chirped .    with this choice , the multiplicative constant @xmath19 is the characteristic length of the nonlinear interaction defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the effective nonlinearity coefficient for the given polarization directions in the medium and @xmath22 is assumed to be the central frequency of the signal field .",

    "( [ eq : eztdecomposition ] ) yields a constant whose changes over the bandwidth of the signal field can be neglected .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath19 is that when the signal field is restricted to a single frequency mode and no phase mismatch with the pump field is present , @xmath19 is the length over which the minimum and the maximum rms quadrature noise scales by @xmath23 .",
