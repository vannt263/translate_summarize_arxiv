    "the coupled cluster ( cc ) hierarchy of size - extensive correlated methods  @xcite features some of the most prominent _ ab initio _ wave function - based models in use today , namely the cc singles and doubles ( ccsd ) model  @xcite , the cc singles , doubles , and triples ( ccsdt ) model  @xcite , the cc singles , doubles , triples , and quadruples ( ccsdtq ) model  @xcite , etc . in the limit of correlation between all @xmath2 electrons of a molecular system ,",
    "the full configuration interaction ( fci ) energy is returned .",
    "while the iterative cc models offer excellent precision , the practical usefulness  in particular of the higher - level models for modest- and large - sized systems  is hampered by a polynomial increase of the computational cost up through the hierarchy .",
    "for this reason , a related branch of correlated methods , which incorporate non - iterative many - body perturbation theory  @xcite ( mbpt ) energy corrections into the cc treatment , has been devised . however , while these perturbative corrections lower the overall cost of the computation , a proper iterative description of the effects of single and double excitations ( at times even triple and quadruple excitations ) within a cc scheme is called for , which is why methods have been devised in which cc and perturbation theory are coupled .",
    "the most renowned of such combined methods is the ccsd(t ) model  @xcite , in which the iterative ccsd energy is augmented by selected mbpt - rationalized corrections for triple excitations  @xcite , and owing in part to fortuitous , yet remarkably consistent error cancellations and in part a favorable computational scaling , ccsd(t ) has developed into the model of choice whenever high - accuracy total , reaction , and interaction energies , equilibrium geometries , and various other molecular properties are desired , cf .",
    ", for instance , the calibration chapter of ref . .",
    "the authoritative position held today by the ccsd(t ) model has been justified by the results of a great number of numerical studies and experimental comparisons , of which the clear majority has been based on closed - shell molecules in their equilibrium geometry , despite the fact that uhf- and rohf - based ccsd(t ) implementations have been available almost from the beginning . however ,",
    "being able to accurately account for triples effects in closed - shell systems will only provide access to a fraction of the manifold of chemical relevant problems encountered in , e.g. , modern catalysis , biological , or even material sciences . within the diversified world of reaction - based chemistry , for instance ,",
    "radicals and bare atoms are omnipresent .",
    "since such reactive species are notoriously difficult to characterize experimentally , computational chemistry , preferably of sufficiently high accuracy , hence has a substantial and valuable role to play in their description and characterization .",
    "thus , taking into account today s automatic predilection for the ccsd(t ) model , it becomes vital to pose the following question : is it obvious that the striking cancellation of errors , which gives rise to the stability of the model , necessarily carries over from closed- to open - shell calculations ?",
    "in answering this , it appears essential to rigorously assess to what accuracy ccsd(t ) total energies of atoms and organic radicals can be obtained , and , if this level of accuracy is not qualitatively acceptable , establish new methods and protocols that enable a balanced treatment of both closed- and open - shell species . on this note",
    ", it has previously been shown how the precision of equilibrium geometries and harmonic vibrational frequencies of small- to modest - sized molecular radicals , as calculated by the ccsd(t ) model , do not mirror that found for comparable closed - shell molecules  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the notion of a cc / mbpt hierarchy of systematically improved models seems not to apply straightaway for open - shell molecules , as second - order mller - plesset ( mp2 )  @xcite results are often no improvement over the underlying mean - field hartree - fock ( hf ) solution  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we wish to suggest and advocate  as an alternative to the widely - used ccsd(t ) model  the recently proposed ccsd(t@xmath0 ) models  @xcite , which not only offer a convergent and well - mannered series of cc triples models for the accurate determination of total electronic energies , but do so , as we will demonstrate , regardless of the spin of the ground state .",
    "the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) series is defined as an order expansion in the mller - plesset fluctuation potential of a bivariational ccsdt energy lagrangian where , from a ccsd zeroth - order expansion point , perturbative solutions of both the exponential ccsdt cluster state and linear @xmath3-state are embedded into the energy corrections  @xcite . in ref . , the accuracy of the second- through fourth - order models of the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) series ( the ccsd(t2 ) , ccsd(t3 ) , and ccsd(t4 ) models , respectively ) was statistically assessed for total electronic energies of a test set of 17 small closed - shell molecules through a comparison with alternative cc triples expansions , including the ccsd(t ) model .",
    "furthermore , non - parallelity errors with respect to the native ccsdt solution were analyzed for the ( symmetric ) bond stretches in hydrogen fluoride and water . in summary ,",
    "the fourth - order ccsd(t4 ) model was found to offer a stable , albeit relatively costly alternative to , e.g. , the ccsd(t ) model , returning the smallest errors among all of the tested models . in the present study",
    ", we will extend the analysis in ref .",
    ", not only by conducting a similar assessment for a test set of 18 atoms and small organic radicals , but also by reporting results for higher - order ( fifth- and sixth - order ) models of the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) series , for total ( equilibrium ) electronic energies and for the symmetric bond stretches in the closed - shell water molecule and the open - shell amidogen radical , as examples of systems at the onset of bond - cleavage for which static correlation effects become increasingly important .",
    "in the second part of the present series  @xcite , we conduct a related study for the ccsdt(q@xmath0 ) quadruples series  @xcite , which is defined  theoretically on par with the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) series  as an order expansion of a bivariational ccsdtq energy lagrangian around a ccsdt zeroth - order expansion point . + for closed - shell systems , given that the ground state is dominated by a single determinant , the solution from a restricted hf ( rhf ) calculation is adequate as the reference for a subsequent treatment of correlation effects . however , for ground states with @xmath4 , or even for molecules which are most appropriately described by ( biradical ) resonance structures , the traditional approach has been to invoke different orbitals for different spins , which is what is done in a more general unrestricted hf ( uhf ) calculation  @xcite .",
    "however , a uhf determinant will in general not correspond to a pure spin state , i.e. , the resulting wave function will usually not be an eigenfunction of the @xmath5 operator .",
    "such contamination of the spin , arising from spurious and highly unphysical contributions from other spin states , is commonly considered a major drawback of any uhf - based method , although the inclusion of correlation effects will generally help to reduce the contamination  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , a restricted open - shell hf ( rohf ) trial function is often preferred over the corresponding uhf one whenever the uhf expectation value @xmath6 deviates significantly from the correct value , i.e. , whenever @xmath7  @xcite . on the other hand , the lack of spin polarization in rohf solutions",
    "may occasionally manifest itself as a drawback and render uhf the better choice .",
    "for this reason , the choice between the two types of open - shell references is an intricate one , and the assumption that rohf - based correlation methods should always be preferred over corresponding uhf - based methods thus can not be expected to hold for all radicals .    for both parts of the present series , we have deliberately chosen to limit our focus to correlated treatments on top of the uhf and rohf references , as these are the two trial functions which are most commonly and routinely used for open - shell systems . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "however , we acknowledge that the use of orbitals from brueckner  @xcite or general orbital - optimized  @xcite cc has previously been shown to reduce spin contamination in some cases  @xcite as well as to alleviate possible symmetry - breaking problems  @xcite . in addition , the use of kohn - sham orbitals has been advocated as an inexpensive alternative to ordinary uhf references  @xcite . however , an investigation of the possible gain from using any of these non - standard determinants falls outside the scope of the present work .",
    "all of the perturbative cc triples models tested here give corrections to the ccsd model , as formulated for either a uhf or an rohf reference  @xcite . as in ref .",
    ", the natural reference target energy , against which we wish to compare the various models , will be that of the ccsdt model  @xcite .",
    "this choice of reference is motivated not only by the fact that the ccsdt model is the theoretical yardstick for all of the approximative triples models  for restricted as well as unrestricted trial functions  but also the fact that any spin contamination of the wave function is practically removed at the ccsdt level of theory . in table",

    "the three different curves for rhf , uhf , and rohf are remarkably similar , with the most notable differences being the rhf results for the ccsd(t2 ) and ccsd(t4 ) models , which are most likely slightly better than what should be expected , as may be seen by comparing these to the corresponding open - shell results .",
    "furthermore , we recognize  as was hinted to in ref .",
    "how the ordinary staircase convergence of hf - based perturbation theory ( mbpt ) is preserved in the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) series , which is based on a ccsd zeroth - order reference ; while the even - ordered corrections to the ccsd energy are large , the odd - ordered corrections are generally much smaller in magnitude , although the fifth - order corrections often work to rectify the somewhat disproportionate , yet rather consistent results achieved at fourth order .",

    "however , this deviation is reduced to @xmath20 kcal / mol as a result of the relaxation and higher - order triples effects which enter the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) series at fourth order  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note from table s6 of the supplementary material that o@xmath8 , when described by an rohf reference determinant , is an odd case for the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) models , giving a deviation at the ccsd(t6)/cc - pvtz level that is about six times larger than the second largest deviation .",

    "spin_cont_table ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in section [ ccsdpt_subsection ] , the oxygen molecule is the only member of the open - shell test set for which the ccsd(t ) model overestimates the ccsdt contribution from triple excitations , and the large differences exhibited by the models of the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) series , which otherwise account satisfactorily for triples effects , thus strongly indicate that the rohf - ccsd(t ) result for this molecule might be rather artificial .",
    "in the course of a chemical reaction , a molecule is often distorted away from its equilibrium geometry along a given internal coordinate .",
    "in such situations , the stretching of bond(s ) will introduce multiconfigurational character , that is , static correlation , into the wave function , which makes a mean - field hf description of the reference state increasingly worse .",
    "an immediate consequence of this is that the overall description of the system becomes exceedingly more difficult .",
    "furthermore , the weights of higher - level excited determinants in the wave function will grow , making it inherently more demanding to apply perturbative models for the recovery of these pronounced effects . thus , in order to further test the models of the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) series  despite the fact that neither of these have been designed specifically to recover static correlation effects  we will here evaluate the models for the symmetric bond stretches in the closed - shell water ( h@xmath8o ) molecule and the open - shell amidogen ( nh@xmath8 ) radical and compare them in terms of their non - parallelity errors with respect to the target ccsdt solution ( the validity of which we will initially assess ) .",

    "thus , it is therefore only of interest to test the performance of the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) models within this region ; for h@xmath8o in figure [ pes_h2o_ccsdtq_figure ] , the ccsdt solution starts to collapse at an elongation of @xmath24 , while for nh@xmath8 in figure [ pes_nh2_ccsdtq_figure ] , this critical point is met at an elongation of @xmath25 .    in figures",
    "[ pes_h2o_ccsdt_figure ] and [ pes_nh2_ccsdt_figure ] , the total deviation from the correlation energy at the ccsdt / cc - pvtz level of theory is reported for both of these stretches , again presented alongside corresponding results for the ccsd(t ) model , which  like the models of the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) series  is designed with the purpose of recovering dynamical correlation only .",
    "if we define a conservative confidence interval to be spanned by a maximum error of @xmath26 kcal / mol , we note how for the water stretch in figure [ pes_h2o_ccsdt_figure ] , the results for the ccsd(t2 ) model all fall outside the confidence interval , the results for the ccsd(t3 ) model nearly so , while the ccsd(t ) results stay within up until a stretch of about @xmath27 . only the higher - order ccsd(t@xmath0 )",
    "models are capable of staying within the interval for all tested bond lengths with , e.g. , the performance of the ccsd(t4 ) model only showing signs of deteriorating near the very end of the tested interval of bond lengths . for the nh@xmath8 stretch in figure [ pes_nh2_ccsdt_figure ] , both the native ccsd and ccsdt models as well as the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) models",
    "are observed to behave similarly to the case of the h@xmath8o stretch in figure [ pes_h2o_figure ] .",
    "however , while the ccsd and ccsdt models deviate less from the ccsdtq solution than for h@xmath8o , the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) models ( as measured against the ccsdt model ) deviate slightly more . for the ccsd(t )",
    "model , on the other hand , the performance for the two test systems is markedly different ; whereas the ccsd(t ) results for nh@xmath8 are similar to the corresponding ccsd(t@xmath0 ) results , that is , the model consistently ( and increasingly ) underestimates the ccsdt triples effects , this is not the case for h@xmath8o , for which the error is positive only up to a certain point ( a stretch of about @xmath28 ) , at which the model suddenly starts to overestimate these effects .",

    "the equilibrium bond length ( @xmath21 ) is @xmath29 pm.,title=\"fig : \" ]    thus , whenever high - accuracy potential energy surfaces in the vicinity of the equilibrium geometry are required , as , e.g. , when these form the basis for vibrational configuration interaction or coupled cluster response theory  @xcite or in the determination of activation energies , the higher - order models of the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) series might offer a stable non - iterative alternative to the ccsdt model . in particular , the fact that triples relaxation effects are accounted for in the fourth- and higher - orders models of the series will make these significantly more stable , albeit more expensive , than various other non - iterative models , as seen , e.g. , from the comparison with the ccsd(t ) model in figures [ pes_h2o_figure ] and [ pes_nh2_figure ] and various other triples models in ref .",
    "( in which a similar analysis of the bond stretch in hydrogen fluoride is also presented ) .",
    "by evaluating frozen - core / cc - pvtz total energies against ccsdt reference results , the performance of the second- through sixth - order models of the recently proposed ccsd(t@xmath0 ) series of triples expansions for uhf and rohf reference determinants has been statistically assessed for a test set of 18 atoms and small radicals .",
    "furthermore , these results have been compared to * ( i ) * the performance of the rhf - based variants of the models for a comparable test set of 17 closed - shell molecules as well as * ( ii ) * corresponding ccsd(t ) results for all three references . in summary",
    ", no differences are found between the treatments of closed- and open - shell species by the higher - order ccsd(t@xmath0 ) models , neither for the size - intensive recovery of the ccsdt triples contribution nor the actual deviation from this .",
    "moreover , the results presented here strongly indicate , as is the case for regular iterative cc models , that the higher - order ccsd(t@xmath0 ) models are capable of significantly reducing the amount of spin contamination which may be present in underlying uhf trial functions , since no behavioural differences are observed between the uhf- and rohf - based ccsd(t@xmath0 ) results reported herein .",
    "these models , in particular the fourth - order ccsd(t4 ) model , thus offer proper non - iterative , albeit more computationally expensive alternatives to the current _ de facto _ standard , the ccsd(t ) model , for which the appraised numerical consistency in recovering ccsdt triples effects is worsened in the transition from closed- to open - shell systems , irrespective of the choice of reference determinant used for the latter type ( uhf / rohf ) .",
    "in addition , the performance assessment of the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) models has been extended to two prototypical bond stretches ( the symmetric vibrational modes in the closed - shell h@xmath8o molecule and open - shell nh@xmath8 radical ) , as examples of systems for which static correlation effects become increasingly dominant .",
    "as for the calculations at equilibrium geometries , the higher - order models of the ccsd(t@xmath0 ) triples series are found to offer results that are in significantly better agreement with the native ccsdt solution than the traditional ccsd(t ) model for molecules at distorted geometries , as , e.g. , encountered along reaction paths or at transition states .",
    "for instance , the performance of the ccsd(t4 ) model is again found to be essentially independent of the reference used , and it will thus be capable of offering a balanced non - iterative treatment of closed- and open - shell species as required in , e.g. , the determination of activation energies , even at intermediate bond lengths where alternative triples expansions may start to collapse .",
