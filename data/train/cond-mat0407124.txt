    "hen eggs provide an excellent possibility for the study of fragmentation of thin brittle shells of disordered materials with the additional advantages of being cheap and easy to handle , making the patience of scientists the only limiting factor for the subsequent improvement of the experimental results .",
    "our experiments were performed on ordinary brown and white egg - shells . in the preparations ,",
    "first two holes of regular circular shape were drilled on the bottom and top of the egg through which the content of the egg was blown - out . the inside was carefully washed and rinsed out several times and finally the empty shells were dried in a microwave oven to get rid of all moisture of the egg - shell .",
    "the drying process proved to be essential to ensure that the cuticula , which can not be blown out , competely looses its toughness .    in the impact experiments",
    "intact egg - shells are catapulted onto the ground at a high speed using a simple setup of rubber bands . the experimental setup provided a relatively high energy impact without the possibility of varying the imparted energy .",
    "the eggs are shot directly into a plastic bag touching the ground so that no fragments are lost for further evaluation .    in the explosion experiment initially the egg - shell is flooded with hydrogen and hung vertically inside a plastic bag .",
    "the combustion reaction is initiated by igniting the escaping hydrogen on the top of the egg .",
    "the hydrogen immediately reacts with the oxygen which is also drawn up into the egg through the bottom hole , mixing with the remaining hydrogen . when enough air has entered to form a combustible mixture inside the egg , the flame back - fires through the top hole and starts the very quick exothermic reaction .",
    "the experiment is carried out inside a soft plastic bag so that secondary fragmentations due to fragment - wall collisions do not occur , furthermore , no pieces were lost after explosion . since the pressure which builds up during combustion",
    "can slightly be changed by the hole size , _",
    "i.e _ the smaller the hole , the higher the pressure at the explosion , we performed several series of experiments with hole diameters @xmath0 between 1.2 and 2.5 millimeter .",
    "the limit values have practical reasons : a drilling nail of large diameter typically breaks the eggs - shell , on the other hand it is extremely difficult to blow out an egg through a hole of diameter 1 mm or less .",
    "it is possible to follow the time evolution of the explosion and impact processes by means of a high speed camera under well controlled conditions .",
    "three consecutive snapshots of the explosion process are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : eggsplode ] taken by a camera of 1000 hz frequency .",
    "the ignition took place at the top of the egg in fig.[fig : eggsplode]@xmath1 .",
    "the instant of back - firing and the initiation of combustion is captured in fig.[fig : eggsplode]@xmath2 , while in fig .",
    "[ fig : eggsplode]@xmath3 already the flying pieces can be seen .",
    "based on the snapshots the total duration of an explosion is estimated to be of the order of 1 millisecond .    in the impact experiment",
    "the egg hits the ground in the direction of its longer axis , as it is illustrated by the picture series of fig .",
    "[ fig : impact ] . after hitting the ground ( fig .",
    "[ fig : impact]@xmath4 ) , the egg suffers gradual collapse as it moves forward ( fig .",
    "[ fig : impact]@xmath5 ) making the impact process relatively longer compared to the explosion .",
    "the resulted egg - shell pieces are then carefully collected and placed on the tray of a scanner without overlap . in the scanned image fragments are seen as black spots on a white background and were further analyzed by a cluster searching code . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_imp ] an example of scanned pieces of an impact experiment is shown where the broad variation of sizes can also be noticed with the naked eye .",
    "a dusty phase of shattered pieces @xcite was also observed in the experiments with fragment sizes falling in the order of the pixel size of the scanner .",
    "the mass @xmath6 of fragments was determined as the number of pixels in the scanned image .",
    "since shattered fragments were also comparable to normal dust pieces in the air , they were excluded in the analysis by setting the lower cut - off of fragment masses to a few pixels .    as the main quantitative result of the experiments we evaluated the mass distribution of fragments @xmath7 which is defined so that @xmath8 provides the probability of finding a fragment with mass falling between @xmath6 and @xmath9 .",
    "[ fig : exp_imp ] presents the fragment mass distributions @xmath7 for impact and explosion experiments averaged over 10 - 20 egg - shells for each curve . for the impact experiment , a power law behavior of the fragment mass distribution @xmath10 can be observed over three orders of magnitude where the value of the exponent can be determined with high precision to @xmath11 .",
    "explosion experiments result also in a power law distribution of the same value of @xmath12 for small fragments with a relatively broad cut - off for the large ones .",

    "note that the relatively small value of the exponent @xmath12 can indicate a cleavage mechanism of shell fragmentation and is significantly different from the experimental and theoretical results on fragmenting two - dimensional bulk systems where @xmath14 has been found @xcite , and from the three - dimensional ones where @xmath15 is obtained @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical studies on fragmentation relay on large scale computer simulations since capabilities of analytic approaches are rather limited in this field due to the complexity of the break - up process . over the past years the discrete element method ( dem ) proved to be a very efficient numerical technique for fragmentation phenomena @xcite since it has the ability to handle large deformations arising dynamically , and naturally captures the propagation and interaction of a large number of simultaneously growing cracks , which is essential for fragmentation .    in order to investigate the fragmentation of spherical shells we constructed a three - dimensional discrete element model such that the surface of the unit sphere is discretized into randomly shaped triangles ( delaunay triangulation ) by throwing points randomly and independently on the surface @xcite . based on the triangulation ,",

    "the breaking criterion is evaluated at each iteration step and those springs which fulfill the condition are removed from the simulation . as a result of successive spring breakings cracks",
    "nucleate , grow and merge on the spherical surface which can give rise to a complete break - up of the shell into smaller pieces .",
    "fragments of the shell are defined in the model as sets of nodes ( material elements ) connected by the remaining intact springs .",
    "the process is stopped when the system has attained a relaxed state , _",

    "the value of @xmath60 is mainly determined by the fixed breaking threshold @xmath22 and the disordered spring properties . since the shell is under constant pressure the nucleated microcracks can grow and join giving rise to planar pieces surrounded by a free crack surface ( fragment ) , as is illustrated in fig.[fig : cracks]@xmath62 .",

    "<S> a theoretical and experimental study of the fragmentation of closed thin shells made of a disordered brittle material is presented . </S>",
    "<S> experiments were performed on brown and white hen egg - shells under two different loading conditions : fragmentation due to an impact with a hard wall and explosion by a combustion mixture giving rise to power law fragment size distributions . for the theoretical investigations a three - dimensional discrete element model of shells is constructed . </S>",
    "<S> molecular dynamics simulations of the two loading cases resulted in power law fragment mass distributions in satisfactory agreement with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> based on large scale simulations we give evidence that power law distributions arise due to an underlying phase transition which proved to be abrupt and continuous for explosion and impact , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the fragmentation of closed shells defines a universality class different from that of two- and three - dimensional bulk systems .    </S>",
    "<S> closed shells made of solid materials are often used in every day life , industrial applications and engineering practice as containers , pressure vessels or combustion chambers . from a structural point of view aircraft vehicles , launch vehicles like rockets and building blocks of a space station are also shell - like systems , and even certain types of modern buildings can be considered as shells . the egg - shell as nature s oldest container proved to be a reliable construction for protecting life . in </S>",
    "<S> most of the applications shell - like constructions operate under an internal pressure much higher than the surrounding one . hence </S>",
    "<S> , careful design and optimization of structural and material properties is required to ensure the stability and reliability of the system . </S>",
    "<S> closed shells usually fail due to an excess internal load which can arise either as a result of slowly driving the system above its stability limit during its usage or service time , or by a pressure pulse caused by an explosive shock inside the shell . due to the widespread applications , </S>",
    "<S> the failure of shell systems is a very important scientific and technological problem which has also an enormous social impact due to the human costs arising , for instance , in accidental events .    </S>",
    "<S> fragmentation , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the breaking of particulate materials into smaller pieces is abundant in nature and underlies several industrial processes , which attracted a continuous interest in scientific and engineering research over the past decades @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fragmentation phenomena can be observed on a broad range of length scales ranging from the collisional evolution of asteroids and meteor impacts on the astrophysical scale , through geological phenomena and industrial applications on the intermediate scale down to the break - up of large molecules and heavy nuclei on the atomic scale . in laboratory experiments on the fragmentation of solids , </S>",
    "<S> the energy input is usually achieved by shooting a projectile into a solid block @xcite , making an explosion inside the sample @xcite or by the collision of macroscopic bodies ( free fall impact ) @xcite . due to the violent nature of the process </S>",
    "<S> , observations on fragmenting systems are often restricted to the final state , making the fragment size ( volume , mass , charge , ... ) to be the main characteristic quantity . the most striking observation on fragmentation </S>",
    "<S> is that the distribution of fragment sizes shows a power law behavior , independently on the way of imparting energy , relevant microscopic interactions and length scales involved , with an exponent depending only on the dimensionality of the system @xcite . during the past years experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite efforts focused on the validity region and the reason of the observed universality in 1 , 2 , and 3 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> detailed studies revealed that universality prevails for large enough input energies when the system falls apart into small enough pieces @xcite , however , at lower energies a systematic dependence of the exponent on the input energy was evidenced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent investigations on the low energy limit of fragmentation suggest that the power law distribution of fragment sizes arises due to an underlying critical point @xcite .    besides the industrial and social impact of the failure of shell like systems , they are also of high scientific importance for the understanding of fragmentation phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> former studies on fragmentation have focused on the behavior of bulk systems in one , two and three dimensions under impact and explosive loading , however , hardly any studies have been devoted to fragmentation of shells @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the peculiarity of the break - up of closed shells originates from the fact that the local structure is inherently two - dimensional , however , the dynamics of the systems , the motion of material elements , deformation and stress states are three - dimensional which allows for a rich variety of failure modes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we present a detailed experimental and theoretical study of the fragmentation of closed solid shells arising due to an excess load inside the shell . </S>",
    "<S> experiments were performed on brown and white hen egg - shells under two different loading conditions : fragmentation due to an impact with a hard wall and explosion by a combustion mixture have been considered resulting in power law fragment size distributions . for simplicity , our theoretical study is restricted to spherical shells such that a three dimensional discrete element model of spherical shell systems was worked out . in molecular dynamics simulations of the two loading cases , </S>",
    "<S> power law fragment mass distributions were obtained in satisfactory agreement with experiments . based on large scale simulations we give evidence that power law distributions arise due to an underlying phase transition which proved to be abrupt for explosion and continuous for impact . analyzing the energetics of the explosion process in the two loading cases and the evolution of the fragment mass distributions </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the fragmentation of closed shells defines a new universality class different from that of two- and three - dimensional bulk systems . </S>"
