    "ever since the double - peaked nucleus of m31 was clearly resolved by hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging @xcite , the morphology of this system has been a challenge to explain .",
    "the most successful kinematic model is the eccentric stellar disk proposed by @xcite where stars in apsidally aligned elliptical orbits about a massive black hole result in an over - density at their apoapses , thus accounting for the brighter peak p1 .",
    "the black hole itself resides near the fainter , more centrally located peak denoted p2 .",
    "though this model has been successful at matching the observed velocity and luminosity distribution ( @xcite ) , eccentric disk formation remains a mystery .",
    "@xcite showed that a small fraction of counter rotating stars , possibly originating from an disrupted globular cluster on a retrograde orbit , could cause a more massive pre - existing stellar disk to develop a lopsided or @xmath3 instability .",
    "the self - consistent kinematic modeling of @xcite , which requires a small percentage of counter rotating stars , supports this scenario .",
    "@xcite proposed that a collision from a passing molecular cloud or globular cluster could knock a pre - existing stellar disk off - center , resulting in a long lived , precessing mode .",
    "the n - body simulations of @xcite have illustrated that lopsided stellar disks could be long - lived .",
    "the scenarios discussed by @xcite , begin with an initially axisymmetric stellar disk , which then becomes lopsided either because of a violent event ( such as a collision with a globular cluster ) or the growth of an instability .",
    "however @xcite proposed that m31 s eccentric disk could have been a result of a single disruption event .",
    "he succeeded at producing an eccentric stellar disk by disrupting a globular cluster near a massive black hole in an n - body simulation , though an sph simulation of the disruption of a massive gaseous cloud did not yield an eccentric disk @xcite .",
    "the massive black hole in in m31 is moderate with a mass @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the eccentric disk itself is nearly as massive as the black hole , @xmath5 @xcite , presenting a problem for the globular cluster disruption scenario proposed by @xcite which assumed that the globular cluster was typical of galactic globular clusters and of order a million solar masses .",
    "here we reconsider bekki s proposal , that a single disruption event could have produced the eccentric disk in m31 .",
    "the disruption event is likely to be complex so we focus on what final disks are capable of supporting lopsided a slow modes , drawing from the recent work of @xcite who developed a formalism for the purpose of predicting the precession rates and eccentricities of discrete modes for low mass , nearly keplerian disks .",
    "we place limits on the density and core radius of progenitor clusters for eccentric disks near massive black holes .",
    "the resulting diagram is useful toward predicting what types of galaxies are most likely to harbor eccentric disks , for predicting the probability that eccentric disk formation events occur and for guiding the initial conditions of n - body simulations which may determine if and how they form .",
    "the observed correlation between mass of a black hole and the bulge dispersion @xcite allows us to relate the black hole to the bulge of its host galaxy .",
    "@xmath6 where @xmath7 is the stellar bulge dispersion , and we adopt constants in the relation given by @xcite . for a discussion on the systematics of measuring the velocity dispersion within @xmath8 , the effective or half light radius , see @xcite .    the transition radius ( sometimes called the sphere of influence ) where the gravity from the black hole takes over from the bulge is @xmath9 using the above relation between the bulge and the black hole mass ,",
    "@xmath10    we now consider disruption of a stellar cluster or molecular cloud by a massive black hole .",
    "the tidal force from the black hole and bulge is @xmath11 s\\ ] ] at distance @xmath12 from the galaxy nucleus and distance @xmath13 from the cluster nucleus .",
    "we set this equal to the gravitational force from the cluster on itself to determine how the cluster disrupts .",
    "we describe the nucleus of a cluster with two parameters , the core radius , @xmath14 , and the density within this radius , @xmath15 .",
    "the cores of isothermal spheres and king models are characterized with with these two parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . within the core radius of the cluster , we assume that the cluster has nearly constant density , so its gravitational potential is proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "we set the tidal force from the galaxy equal to that from the cluster and determine the distance @xmath16 , ( the disruption radius ) when the two are equal .",
    "the distance from the galaxy nucleus where the entire core of the cluster disrupts is then set only by the cluster core density , @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath17 inside the transition radius the disruption radius @xmath18 outside the transition radius @xmath19    we expect that it is difficult to make a slowly precessing eccentric disk in a region where the black hole does not dominate the gravitational field .",
    "outside the sphere of influence , the potential is strongly non - keplerian .",
    "the requirement that the cluster be disrupted ( survive to ) within the transition radius is @xmath20 .",
    "using the previous equation , the definition for @xmath21 , and the relationship between the bulge stellar dispersion and the black hole mass this constraint gives the requirement @xmath22 from this we see that the less massive the black hole , the more dense a cluster would be required to form an eccentric disk .",
    "this condition is our first constraint on progenitor clusters for eccentric disks .    at radii larger than the disruption radius",
    ", the outer parts of the stellar cluster or galaxy core would be stripped .",
    "we expect that the radial distribution of the resulting disk will depend upon the concentration of the cluster or radial profile of the infalling galaxy bulge or core .",
    "since the densest part of the cluster is disrupted at @xmath16 , we expect that this part is most likely to be involved in any large eccentricity amplitude variation .",
    "so we can estimate the mass of the active disk formed at disruption using the core radius of the cluster , @xmath14 , resulting in an active disk of mass equal to the mass within the core of the cluster , @xmath23 .",
    "the width of this active disk would be of the order of the core radius of the cluster .",
    "@xcite assume that the mass of the disk is less than that of the black hole .",
    "if we consider the active part of the disk , this is even true in m31 ( the center of mass is closest the black hole ) .",
    "it s difficult to imagine a stable situation when the lopsided part of the disk is as massive as the black hole so we arrive at another constraint on our progenitor cluster , @xmath24    it is unlikely that a thin disk will result following disruption unless the disk mach number , @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the angular rotation rate at the disruption radius @xmath16 , and @xmath28 is the central cluster dispersion .",
    "following disruption of the cluster , the energy spread of the particles is set by the cluster core radius , @xmath14 , so we expect that the resulting width of the disk @xmath29 .",
    "the angular momentum spread at disruption is also set by the size of the cluster core , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the angular momentum of the bulk motion of the cluster at disruption . consequently following disruption",
    "we expect a disk radial velocity dispersion at least @xmath32 this scaling is similar to that outlined by @xcite for the disruption of dwarf galaxies .",
    "alternately we can use the relation between central dispersion , core density and radius for a king model ( @xmath33 ) . using either estimate for @xmath28 and inserting into equation([mach ] ) ,",
    "assume that we are within the transition radius so that @xmath34 we estimate @xmath35 which is equivalent to requiring @xmath36 .    in summary",
    "we can constrain properties of an incoming cluster which subsequently forms an eccentric disk :    1 .   @xmath20 .",
    "the disruption radius should be less than the transition radius .",
    "2 .   @xmath37 .",
    "the cluster core radius should be less than the transition radius .",
    "3 .   @xmath38 .",
    "the cluster core mass should be less than the black hole mass .",
    "this constraint is equivalent to requiring @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "we plot these three constraints as lines in figure 1 for three different black hole masses , and as a function of cluster core radius , @xmath14 , and density , @xmath15 .",
    "the allowed region of parameter space for a disrupted cluster to form an eccentric disk is the upper left hand corner , corresponding to core radii above about a pc , and core densities above about @xmath0 .",
    "also shown in figure 1 are measured core radii and central densities ( assuming a mass to light ratio of @xmath41 in solar units ) for the milky way globular clusters based on the quantities compiled by @xcite .",
    "we also include on figure 1 , the massive globular cluster g1 ( based on core properties estimated by @xcite ) and the cores of m31 , m32 and m33 , based on density profiles ( or limits in the case of m32 ) estimated by @xcite .",
    "limits on the density and core radius are placed on the figure 1 for the two densest galaxies ( other than m31 , m32 , and m33 ) studied by @xcite .",
    "higher angular resolution observations would be needed to find out if more distant galaxies can have cores with the high stellar densities of m31 , m32 and m33 .",
    "we see from figure 1 that galactic globular clusters are capable of forming eccentric disks if they are extremely dense and have compact cores , and they are more likely to do so in galaxy nuclei containing larger black holes .",
    "however , to provide a plausible progenitor for an eccentric disk , a cluster must not only have a dense and compact core but be massive enough to account for the mass of the entire disk .",
    "galactic globular clusters are not massive enough to account for the disk in m31 .",
    "we examine the properties of the simulated disruptions done by @xcite to see if they are consistent with our proposed progenitor cluster limits . in an n - body simulation",
    ", @xcite succeeded in producing a stellar eccentric disk by disrupting a globular cluster of mass 0.1 times the black hole mass , for @xmath42 .",
    "the bulge he adopted was described by an nfw profile with a scale radius of @xmath43pc . for this adopted bulge profile",
    "we calculate that the mass enclosed within 10pc was less than a million @xmath44 so that the entire disruption took place within what we have called the transition radius , where the gravity from the black hole takes over from the bulge ( equation [ rt_def ] ) .",
    "his simulated cluster disrupted at a radius of @xmath45pc from the black hole , and since the cluster core was much smaller than this , @xmath46pc , the stellar system was capable of forming an eccentric disk . we conclude that the success of his simulation in producing the eccentric disk is consistent with the crude limits we have placed on progenitor cluster properties .",
    "the sph simulation by @xcite , however , produced a circular disk , not an eccentric one .",
    "the gas cloud in this simulation was of similar mass to that of the stellar cluster , @xcite but had a significantly larger scale length of 10pc .",
    "the cluster disrupted at @xmath47pc which is approximately the same as the core radius of the gas cloud .",
    "we suspect that a gas cloud with a smaller core radius would have been capable of producing an eccentric disk .",
    "again , we find that the failure of this simulation in producing the eccentric disk is consistent with the crude limits we have placed on progenitor cluster properties .",
    "the two peaks observed in the nucleus of m31 are separated by 1.87 pc @xcite and the black hole mass is @xmath48 @xcite , so we expect a transition radius of @xmath49 pc which is , as we expect , outside the location of the eccentric part of the disk .",
    "the width of the eccentric part of the disk is about 0.2 \" or @xmath50pc so we would estimate that if the disk formed from a disrupted cluster that its core radius would have been smaller .",
    "the total mass in the most eccentric part of the disk is about @xmath51 @xcite so we would require a progenitor cluster of @xmath52pc and @xmath53 a few times @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath55 the disruption radius @xmath16 ( estimated by equation [ inside ] ) is consistent with the location of the eccentric disk itself .    to provide a plausible progenitor ,",
    "a cluster must not only have a dense and compact core but be massive enough to account for the mass of the entire disk .",
    "the extended , nearly circular part of the m31 stellar disk dominates its mass and has been estimated to be @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "this is massive compared to galactic globular clusters , presenting a problem for the globular cluster disruption scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "however extremely massive extra - galactic clusters have been identified . for comparison ,",
    "we show in figure 1 the location of the massive globular cluster ( or perhaps core of a dwarf galaxy ) which is 40kpc from the nucleus of m31 .",
    "this cluster has a mass of @xmath56 @xcite , a core radius @xmath57pc , and a core density @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "g1 is massive enough that it could have accounted for the mass in the extended ( and almost circular ) part of m31 s eccentric disk , though its tidal radius is large , @xmath59pc , which implies that much of the cluster would have disrupted well outside the location of the eccentric disk in m31 .    the estimated progenitor core properties required to form the m31 eccentric disk are surprising if we compare them to milky way globular clusters and nearly matched by the exotic and extremely massive extra - galactic cluster g1 .",
    "however , they are similar to what has been measured in galaxy nearby cores , such as m33 , m32 and m31 itself , which we have also placed on figure 1 .",
    "we see from this figure that galaxy cores can have the high densities and compactness to be eccentric disk progenitor candidates . moreover , they are usually more massive than globular clusters and so can more easily account for the mass in m31 s eccentric disk .",
    "the other well known example with a double nucleus is ngc 4486b , with a separation of 0.15 \" or 12 pc between the two isophotal peaks @xcite and a black hole mass of @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the transition radius in this galaxy would be @xmath61pc ; so again we find that the eccentric stellar disk lies within @xmath21 . from equation([inside ] ) and using 12 pc for the disruption radius we estimate that the progenitor core density would be @xmath62 .",
    "the width of the peaks comprising the disk ( and hence the progenitor core radius ) is estimated to be 24 pc .",
    "however , ngc 4486a is much more distant than m31 , and consequently the eccentric disk mass is probably much higher than that of m31 , probably exceeding @xmath2 and this is too massive for a globular cluster .",
    "however as in the case of m31 s estimated progenitor , the central densities , core radius and total mass are reasonable for a galaxy core .      in equation([rt_def ] ) we have assumed an isothermal profile for the stellar density profile of the background galaxy . however , as shown by multiple studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) galaxy cores at small radii are seldom fit with a surface brightness profile proportional to @xmath63 ( where @xmath64 is the observed angular radius from the nucleus on the sky ) corresponding to an isothermal density profile @xmath65 .",
    "images from the hst have been part of a major effort to classify the nuclear stellar profiles in early - type galaxies , resulting in the classification of light profiles into two categories , galaxies with shallow inner cusps , denoted ` core - type ' profiles and galaxies with ` power - law ' light profiles @xcite .",
    "power - law type galaxy cores tend to have the steepest nuclear surface brightness profiles @xmath66 with @xmath67 nearly equal to 1 in only the the most extreme cases .",
    "most of the galaxies studied by @xcite had shallower profiles .",
    "this implies that equation([r_t ] ) somewhat underestimates the transition radius in most galaxies , particularly in the galaxies classified as core - type in which @xmath67 is close to zero .",
    "we can regard our estimated radius ( equation [ r_t ] ) as a lower limit on the transition radius for all but the galaxies with the steepest nuclear profiles .",
    "we now consider the problem of two merging galaxies , both with more complex stellar density profiles and both with massive black holes .",
    "we can approximately describe the primary as having a transition radius given by equation([r_t ] ) ( which is actually a lower limit as mentioned above ) .",
    "if the secondary has a power - law form for its density profile then it will not completely disrupt at a particular radius , like the non - singular isothermal sphere or king models .",
    "one component of the nuker surface brightness profile @xcite is the break radius , @xmath68 , where the slope of the surface brightness profile changes . for profiles denoted core - type , within @xmath68 , the surface brightness ( and so density ) rises much less steeply with decreasing radius than outside it . because the surface brightness for core - type galaxies only increases slightly within @xmath68 , we can associate the break radius and density estimated at this radius , with the core radius @xmath14 and density @xmath15 which we have used in the previous sections .",
    "this lets us determine if the bulge or stellar component of the secondary galaxy will survive tidal truncation to within the transition radius of the primary . a secondary with break radius exceeding its own transition radius @xmath69 ( likely to be true for luminous galaxies )",
    "will almost completely disrupt when the tidal truncation radius reaches its break radius",
    ". the black hole of the secondary will then spiral in to the nucleus of the primary , leaving the stellar component of the secondary behind .",
    "however for bulges and fainter ellipticals , we expect @xmath70 .",
    "for example , m32 s profile is steeply rising well within its transition radius @xmath71pc and increases in density to its last measured point @xcite . in this case",
    "the core would be continuously disrupted , though we expect a change in the surface brightness profile of the resulting disk set by the location at which the tidal truncation radius of the secondary was equal to its own transition radius .",
    "the continuous stripping of the secondary in the presence of the secondary s black hole may prevent the formation of a lopsided disk .",
    "the radius of tidal disruption can be estimated by comparing the mean density of the object to that of the object disrupting it ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at a distance @xmath12 from the nucleus of the primary galaxy ,",
    "the mean density resulting from the black hole is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the mass of the primary s black hole .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the transition radius of the primary , so the contribution from the primary s bulge is negligible .    for a secondary galaxy with a power - law law density profile ( see @xcite section 2.1e )",
    "@xmath76 the mass integrated out to radius @xmath13 is @xmath77 so the mean density within this radius @xmath78 for radii @xmath79 outside the transition radius of the secondary .",
    "we set the mean density of the primary within @xmath12 ( due to the primary s massive black hole ) equal to the that of secondary ( within stripping radius @xmath13 ) , @xmath80 , and find that @xmath81 when the secondary is at a distance @xmath12 from the nucleus of the primary , it will be stripped out to a distance @xmath13 from its own nucleus , where @xmath13 is related to @xmath12 by the previous equation .",
    "the stripping radius , @xmath13 , is the same size as the distance from the primary s nucleus , @xmath12 , at a radius @xmath82^{1 \\over 3-\\alpha } a\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the mass of the primary s black hole . when @xmath13 estimated from equation([r3 ] ) exceeds @xmath12 then the secondary engulfs the nucleus of the primary .",
    "for a disrupted secondary galaxy core to produce an eccentric disk , we expect that the radius at which the secondary engulfs the nucleus of the primary , @xmath8 , should be smaller than the transition radius of the primary ( @xmath75 ) . in this case , the core of the secondary will survive intact within the transition of the secondary . a reasonable condition for formation of an eccentric disk via the disruption of a galaxy with a power - law density profile should be @xmath83 using equations([def_re],[r_t ] ) this is equivalent to @xmath84 where @xmath85 . for an isothermal profile , the limit on the density at @xmath86pc @xmath87      with the exception of @xcite",
    ", few simulations have been carried out with realistic stellar density profiles and central black holes .",
    "@xcite presented n - body simulations of two merging galaxies , the primary with a shallow central density profile and the secondary with a steeper profile at the nucleus .",
    "they did simulations with and without massive nuclear black holes to illustrate the difference in remnant profiles following the merger .",
    "the density profiles adopted for their simulations were generated from the family introduced by @xcite .",
    "to explore the role of the black holes on the disruption of the secondary in their simulations we estimate the transition radii for each galaxy . at small radii , @xmath88 ,",
    "both galaxies were power - law in form @xmath89 where @xmath90 was the mass of the galaxy and @xmath91 was its scale length . @xcite used @xmath92 for the primary , and @xmath93 for the secondary ( subscripts here refer to the primary and secondary galaxy respectively ) .",
    "we estimate the transition radius for each galaxy ( sphere of influence ) by calculating the radius at which the integrated stellar mass within equals that of the central black hole . for the primary galaxy @xmath94 where we have integrated equation([rho ] ) and",
    "used the ratio @xmath95 ( that adopted by @xcite ) . for the secondary galaxy we estimate @xmath96 because the transition radius of the secondary was so small , its black hole should not have affected the simulations ( they were probably not well resolved on that scale ) .    both simulations produced similar remnants at radii larger than 0.1 times the primary s scale length .",
    "the change in the surface brightness profiles at this radius was probably due to the break radius ( scale length at which the density profile changes slope ) of the secondary .    for the simulations containing both massive black holes ,",
    "a change in radial density profile is seen in the remnant at approximately the primary s transition radius ( see their figure 2d . ) using their profiles , we estimate that @xmath97 times the scale length of the secondary , which is consistent with the survival of a fraction of the secondary s core to well within the transition radius of the primary .",
    "the constraints developed in the previous section were not violated ( @xmath98 ) , so this type of simulation might have been capable of forming an eccentric disk in the remnant .",
    "if the simulation did not form one , then simultaneous disruption of the densest part of the cluster might be required to form an eccentric disk .",
    "this would occur when the core has a well defined core radius ( and nearly constant density within ) , and may not occur when the secondary has a steeply increasing density profile all the way to its nucleus .    in the simulations lacking the massive black holes ( see their figure 2h ) , the secondary did not disrupt within its break or scale radius .",
    "this follows because the mean density of the secondary significantly exceeds the mean density of the primary within their scale radii , consequently the primary could not have disrupted the secondary within the secondary s scale radius .",
    "the merger simulations of @xcite were done with a quite massive primary black hole @xmath99 and lacked a secondary black hole . from their initial density profiles we estimate that the size of the secondary at its disruption radius in their 10:1 simulation was only about a third the disruption radius itself .",
    "this implies that a disk could be formed from the secondary , following disruption .",
    "@xcite reported that their simulations produced a spinning remnant disk , however it was was thick , consistent with our crude estimate of the secondary s largish size during disruption .",
    "much of the secondary survived to within the transition radius of the pimary s black hole ( about 30 pc ) .",
    "it is possible that a denser secondary ( better satisfying the conditions in eqns 1820 ) could result in a thinner stellar disk which might then be more likely to be lopsided .",
    "alternatively , a secondary with a shallow core ( that would would disrupt all at once , as simulated by @xcite ) might be required for eccentric disk formation .",
    "in this paper we have considered the possibility that a single disruption event could result in the formation of an eccentric stellar disk such as are found in m31 and possibly ngc 4486b .",
    "we explore the scenario of a galaxy core which is stripped as it spirals in toward a nuclear massive black hole until it reaches a critical radius , denoted here as @xmath16 , the disruption radius . in the simplest model of an isothermal sphere ,",
    "the disruption radius is set by the cluster core or king radius and central density .",
    "we suggest that an eccentric disk can not form unless the core of the galaxy or stellar cluster is disrupted within the sphere of influence of the massive black hole , referred to here as the transition radius , @xmath21 , and the core radius is smaller than the radius at which it disrupts .",
    "to succeed in making an eccentric disk , we find that the progenitor cluster core must be denser and more compact for less massive black holes",
    ".    for the eccentric disk in m31 , the progenitor cluster core density must be greater than @xmath0 and core radius smaller than a pc . from the radius , width and mass of the most eccentric region of the disk we estimate that the density of the core was a few times @xmath100 and the core radius was of order a half pc .",
    "massive extragalactic globular clusters such as g1 might be dense , compact and massive enough to be an eccentric disk progenitor , however they are probably too diffuse to account for the large disk mass in m31 within a few parsecs of its black hole .    dense bulges such as found in m31 itself , and in lower luminosity ellipticals galaxies such as m32 , are dense and compact enough that they could be similar to progenitors for m31 s and ngc 4486b s eccentric disks .",
    "nuclear star clusters , such as found in m33 , may also be dense and compact enough to be progenitors . though the mass of m33 s cluster ( a few million @xmath44 ) is too small to be a progenitor for m31 s eccentric disk , the nuclear stellar clusters observed by @xcite in late - type galaxies have half light radii of order 5pc , range in their estimated masses from @xmath101 , and",
    "so could be progenitors for eccentric disks following disruption by a massive black hole .",
    "because of the large mass of bulges and nuclear star clusters at small radii , it would be easier to account for the high masses of the two known eccentric disks by disrupting them , than possible by disrupting a globular cluster .",
    "while the massive black hole in m32 might prevent a progenitor similar to m32 from forming an eccentric disk , nuclear clusters such as found in m33 can lack massive black holes and so might provide better progenitor candidates . to date",
    "the high angular resolution of hst has resolved extremely high stellar densities or order @xmath102 in only the nearest galaxy bulges . until higher angular resolution observations are available",
    ", we will not know if such high density galaxy cores are common .",
    "the two galaxies with double nuclei , m31 and ngc 4486b , exhibit only moderate color variations in their nuclei @xcite , a situation that could be a natural consequence of a scenario that involves the merging of galaxy bulges ( proposed here ) , and is more difficult to explain with a scenario that forms a younger disk in situ ( an ingredient of the formation scenarios discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "the scenario proposed here is based on a simple tidal disruption argument and can be most quickly tested with n - body simulations such as have been carried out by @xcite .",
    "the simulations of @xcite established that the disruption of a cluster could result in the formation of an eccentric disk , and @xcite have carried out simulations based on realistic galaxy profiles and with massive black holes .",
    "@xcite established that a spinning nuclear stellar disk can be a remnant .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the merger of two galaxy cores can result in the creation of an eccentric stellar disk .",
    "we suspect that the merger of a primary galaxy containing a very massive black hole with a secondary with a ` core - type ' or shallow central surface brightness profile , and significantly lower mass black hole , would be most likely to form an eccentric disk with n - body simulations . for the core - type galaxies , the break radius and density at this radius provide an equivalent for the king or core radius and central density used in figure 1 and so can be used to estimate the likelihood that the core can disrupt to form an eccentric disk .",
    "if the merger of galaxy bulges can result in the formation of an eccentric disk , then their formation would be a natural consequence of hierarchical galaxy formation , and can also be used to probe the properties of the parents of galaxies which contain them .",
