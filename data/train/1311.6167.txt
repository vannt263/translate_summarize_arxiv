    "such a setting covers the case of the x - ray transforms of symmetric covariant @xmath14-tensors for any integer @xmath15 , in which case the integrand in takes the form @xmath16 given @xmath2 a non - trapping surface with boundary and its ray transform defined on @xmath17 , questions of theoretical interest are injectivity ( or characterization of the lack thereof ) , stability , range characterization and reconstruction algorithms .",
    "the case of functions ( @xmath18 ) has applications in computerized tomography and injectivity was first solved in @xcite for simple metrics .",
    "integral transforms of vector fields ( @xmath19 ) arise in doppler ultrasound tomography , and injectivity over solenoidal vector fields was first established in @xcite in the simple case .",
    "pestov and uhlmann then derived in @xcite fredholm equations leading to a reconstruction procedure up to smooth error for both cases @xmath20 .",
    "these formulas become exact when curvature is constant , and can be made exact when curvature is close enough to constant @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath21 arises in the deformation ( or linearized ) boundary rigidity problem , which involves the inversion of the ray transform of a second - order tensor ( a perturbation of a known background metric tensor ) .",
    "this case is treated in @xcite via variations of dirichlet - to - neumann maps .",
    "the case of fourth - order tensors ( @xmath22 ) finds applications in travel time tomography in slightly anisotropic elastic media ( * ? ? ?",
    "7 ) , where the complex amplitude of compressional waves gives , to first approximation , the ray transform of a symmetric @xmath23-tensor .",
    "microlocal techniques in @xcite show in general that the normal operator @xmath24 is a smoothing pseudo - differential operator of order @xmath25 , and the authors give there a microlocal inversion over tensors of arbitrary order for simple metrics , thereby giving a microlocal procedure to resolve singularities .",
    "while the work previously described establishes a stability result , the question of solenoidal injectivity for tensors of any order on simple surfaces was recently established in @xcite , and a range characterization was given by the same authors in @xcite , proving in passing more general results for attenuated ray transforms .",
    "the interested reader is also invited to read the review @xcite for more general settings and open problems .    in the present article",
    ", we consider inversion formulas for the x - ray transform over elements of the form ( i ) @xmath26 and ( ii ) @xmath27 ( @xmath28 denotes the transverse geodesic flow , defined in sec .

    "the case @xmath18 corresponds to functions and solenoidal vector fields treated in @xcite .",
    "the integrands of the kind ( i ) mentioned above are particular kinds of symmetric tensors in a basis of holomorphic coordinates @xmath34 for the underlying riemann surface ( see @xcite ) : an element of @xmath35 can be obtained by considering tensors of the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 for some function @xmath3 defined on @xmath4 and where @xmath38 denotes symmetrization",
    ". when @xmath39 or @xmath40 equals zero , such tensors are symmetric differentials . on the other hand , elements of the kind ( ii )",
    "arise naturally by duality of the first problem , in a similar way to @xcite when @xmath18 . for both integrands considered ,",
    "the recent @xmath41-injectivity result in @xcite allows us to first prove that the problem considered here is , in fact , ( completely ) injective regardless of whether these integrands are solenoidal , which not all of them are .",
    "this injectivity is to be expected as , unlike full symmetric @xmath42-tensor fields , these elements are only spanned by two dimensions of data , which makes the problem considered formally determined .",
    "reconstruction formulas for solenoidal tensors of order @xmath43 in the non - euclidean setting are still under active study ( in the euclidean case , sharafutdinov settles the question in any dimension @xmath44 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.12.2 ) ) . in that regard and",
    "since any smooth symmetric tensor decomposes orthogonally into @xmath45 , inversion of the ray transform over @xmath35 can be seen as a building block toward such reconstruction formulas .",
    "the range characterization of the ray transform over @xmath35 was recently used in @xcite as a tool for characterizing the range of the ray transform over symmetric @xmath14-tensors .",
    "inverting @xmath46 for @xmath47 can also be recast as inverting the attenuated ray transform of a function for a particular unitary connection , a purely imaginary `` attenuation '' term . in the case of a real - valued attenuation , reconstruction algorithms for such transforms",
    "were provided in @xcite .",
    "a novelty here is that the inversion in this case does not use holomorphic integrating factors .",
    "the main idea here consists in conjugating the hilbert transform ( by appropriate powers of a non - vanishing abelian differential ) rather than conjugating the geodesic flow , and using some ideas of @xcite to derive fredholm equations for the unknowns .",
    "these equations in turn allow the reconstruction of @xmath14-differentials and their transverse derivative up to a smooth , explicitely given error in the case of _ simple _ metrics .",
    "in addition , we prove that said error operators become contractions when the curvature and its gradient are small enough in uniform norm , so that the fredholm equations become exact reconstruction formulas via neumann series , generalizing a prior result by krishnan @xcite in the case @xmath18 .",
    "such conditions on curvature become more stringent as the tensor order @xmath14 increases .",
    "finally , we present a numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithms derived , using a matlab code previously developed by the author and presented in @xcite in the context of inverting the ray transform over functions and solenoidal vector fields .",
