    "the standard model ( sm ) has excellently described high energy physics up to energies of @xmath4 gev .",
    "the only undetected constituent of the sm , up to now , is a higgs boson which is required to explain the generation of fermion and gauge boson masses .",
    "theoretically the higgs boson mass squared is quadratically sensitive to any new physics scale beyond the standard model ( bsm ) which may arise at higher energy scales and hence stabilization of the higgs mass squared prefers the energy scale at which the bsm turns up to be lowered to @xmath5 tev . on the other hand ,",
    "electroweak precision measurements with naive naturalness assumption raise the energy scale of the bsm up to 100 tev or even higher .",
    "hence , there remains a tension between theory and experiment associated with the stabilization of the sm higgs mass .",
    "but with the start - up of the lhc in 2007 the tension may be relaxed by directly observing the bsm at tev energy scale .",
    "supersymmetry is one of the most attractive approaches to stabilize the higgs mass squared .",
    "the cancellation of quadratic divergences between the sm particle and their superpartner loops in the sm higgs mass squared is one of the main motivation for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and its extensions .",
    "the mssm predicts that the upper bound of the sm higgs mass is 135 gev for @xmath6 gev and @xmath7 tev , where @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this higgs mass upper bound can be relaxed in non - minimal extensions of the mssm . however , unsuppressed flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and other constraints almost rule out the entire parameter space of so - called mssm-124  @xcite in its most general form .",
    "the idea of little higgs originates in the speculation that the sm higgs may be a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson  @xcite .",
    "stabilization of the higgs mass in the little higgs theories is achieved by the  collective symmetry breaking \" which naturally renders the sm higgs mass much smaller than the symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the distinct elements of little higgs models are a vector - like heavy top quark and various scalar and vector bosons .",
    "the former is universal while the latter is model - dependent . both of them contribute significantly to one - loop processes and hence establish strict constraints on the parameter space of little higgs models . at worst , electroweak precision tests push up the symmetry breaking scale to @xmath9 tev or higher , and regenerate significant fine - tuning in the higgs potential .    the idea of twin higgs shares the same origin with that of little higgs in that the sm higgs is a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson  @xcite .",
    "but rather than using collective symmetry breaking to stabilize the higgs mass squared , the twin higgs mechanism makes use of additional discrete symmetry . in other words ,",
    "the discrete symmetry ensures the absence of quadratic divergence in the higgs mass squared .",
    "the mirror twin higgs model containing a complete copy of the sm identifies the discrete symmetry with mirror parity .",
    "the sm world and its mirror world communicate only through the higgs so that the mirror particles are very elusive in the sm world and yield poor phenomenology at the lhc .",
    "the twin higgs mechanism is also realized by identifying the discrete symmetry with left - right symmetry in the left - right model  @xcite .",
    "the left - right twin higgs ( lrth ) model contains @xmath10 global symmetry as well as @xmath11 gauge symmetry .",
    "the left - right symmetry acts on only the two @xmath12 s gauge symmetry . a pair of vector - like heavy top quarks play a key role at triggering electroweak symmetry breaking just as that of the little higgs theories .",
    "besides , the other higgs particles acquire large masses not only at quantum level but also at tree level .",
    "these heavy higgs bosons make the model deliver much richer phenomenology at the lhc  @xcite compared with the mirror twin higgs model .",
    "but theoretically they lead to large radiative corrections to one - loop processes and , in return , the allowed parameter space can be reduced significantly . in this paper",

    "another scale @xmath156 , which is associated with the masses of the heavy gauge bosons , can be determined from the electroweak symmetry breaking condition : there is a generic relation between @xmath46 and @xmath3 since coleman - weinberg potential of the higgs boson mostly depends on @xmath157 and @xmath46 . for scalar potential",

    "but for nonzero @xmath82 where the mixing is turned on , mass of the heavy top quark become large as @xmath82 increases for a given @xmath3 , and the fermionic loop contributions tend to become large , too .",
    "but at the same time the effects of mixing angles on the fermionic loops become significant as either @xmath3 or @xmath82 increases while the condition of electroweak symmetry breaking is retained . in other words , since the mixing angles are determined by @xmath3 and @xmath82 , the one - loop corrected @xmath0 parameter begins to waver as @xmath3 increases even with the fixed scalar mass parameters . because of this nature ,",
    "fine tuning in the @xmath0-parameter is inevitable for large @xmath3 , as will be shown later .    to draw a meaningful information on the model parameters from the @xmath0-parameter , we scan the parameter space generally , i.e. , @xmath172 even though too large @xmath3 makes the model unviable , we take the rather large value of @xmath3 , 2.5 tev , as an upper limit for completeness of the scanning . as a result of @xmath0-parameter calculation ,",

    "[ fig : murm ] shows the allowed regions of parameter space ( a ) for @xmath3 versus @xmath82 and ( b ) for @xmath3 versus @xmath152 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the allowed parameter space is divided into two regions ; less than 670 gev and larger than 1100 gev roughly , for @xmath3 .",
    "this can be figured out as follows .",
    "the loop corrections tend to be larger as @xmath3 increases .",
    "it is because the masses of the particles involved in one - loop correction increase in general as @xmath3 increases .",
    "but at the same time , the mixing angles of top - heavy top quarks also vary .",
    "since the mixing angles depend on not only @xmath3 but also @xmath82 , these two effects compete during the increase of @xmath3 .",

    "so for fitting the observed w - boson mass in the small @xmath3 region , which is directly related to the @xmath0-parameter , we restrict the @xmath137 within rather small range . because the @xmath137 is mostly determined by @xmath174 , it should be also small . for doing that",

    "soft symmetry breaking parameter @xmath152 is restricted to the values less than around @xmath176 .",
