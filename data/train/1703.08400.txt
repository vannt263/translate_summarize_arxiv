    "<S> besides having unique electronic properties , graphene is claimed to be the strongest material in nature@xcite . in the press release of the nobel committee@xcite it is claimed that a hammock made of a squared meter of one - atom thick graphene could sustain the weight of a 4 kg cat . </S>",
    "<S> more practically important are many applications of graphene like scaffolds@xcite and sensors@xcite which are crucially dependent on the mechanical strength . </S>",
    "<S> meter - sized graphene is even being considered as material for the lightsails in the starshot project to reach the star alpha centaury@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted exceptional strength of graphene is based on its very large young modulus which is , per atomic layer , much larger than that of steel . </S>",
    "<S> this reasoning however would apply to conventional thin plates@xcite but does not take into account the peculiar properties of graphene as a thermally fluctuating crystalline membrane@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown recently both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite that thermal fluctuations lead to a dramatic reduction of the young modulus and increase of the bending rigidity for micron - sized graphene samples in comparison with atomic scale values . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the use of the standard fppl - von karman elasticity ( fvk ) theory for thin plates@xcite not directly applicable to graphene and other single atomic layer membranes . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is important because the current interpretation of experimental results is based on the fvk theory . in particular , we show that the fvk - derived schwerin equation , routinely used to derive the young modulus from indentation experiments@xcite has to be essentially modified for graphene at room temperature and for micron sized samples . based on scaling analysis and atomistic simulation we investigate the mechanics of graphene under transverse load up to breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the limits of applicability of the fvk theory and provide quantitative estimates for the different regimes . </S>"
