    "consider a diffusive stochastic process @xmath0 , with an initial condition @xmath1 . once @xmath0 reaches a certain threshold value @xmath2 , the process is stopped and restarted at @xmath1 .",
    "the distribution of times for @xmath0 to first reach @xmath2 across the ensemble of measurements , the first - exit time distribution , arises in many physical applications @xcite .",
    "mean first - exit times are readily calculated from explicit forms for the dynamical rules controlling the process @xmath0 .",
    "however , in many applications , the underlying physics is unknown , complex , and/or very difficult to model . in such instances ,",
    "the question arises as to whether one can reconstruct the form of the governing equations or equation parameters that best fit measured data ( such as first - exit time distributions ) . in this paper , we analyse a general scalar diffusive process to formally determine how much of the drift and diffusion functions can be determined from first - exit time data .    many first passage time problems can be recast as inverse problems .",
    "we describe two physical realizations that motivate this work : transmembrane voltage spike frequencies in neurons @xcite , and first passage times over a molecular barrier in the rupture of chemical bonds @xcite .",
    "the transmembrane voltage of a nerve cell is routinely measured and typically exhibits repeated , sharp spikes .",
    "a class of reduced models for the transmembrane voltage @xmath3 is described by    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are typically polynomial functions of @xmath3 , and @xmath7 is a noise arising from interactions with the many other connected neurons .",
    "this langevin - type equation is to be appropriately interpreted with stratonovich calculus @xcite .",
    "an additional , instantaneous nonlinearity that gives rise to a spike and voltage reset is implicitly included by imposing a threshold voltage @xmath8 .",
    "this nonlinearity arises ultimately from the nonlinear dynamics of ion channels that span the cell membrane @xcite . upon reaching @xmath8 ,",
    "the system instantaneously spikes and resets to the value @xmath9 .",
    "various forms of @xmath5 and @xmath6 have found wide use .",
    "for example , when the noise @xmath7 arising from other connected nerve cells changes the nerve cell s membrane conductivity , @xmath10 both linear ( linear integrate - and - fire ) and quadratic ( quadratic integrate - and - fire ) forms are used to model @xmath5 @xcite , although it is often unclear which model of @xmath5 is most appropriate @xcite . instead of solving for the spike times for presupposed @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite , our goal is to infer as much as possible about the nonlinear current - voltage relationship @xmath5 and coupling to noisy inputs @xmath6 , given a measured spike time distribution @xcite .",
    "another application where first exit times can be used to reconstruct models is in the single molecule measurements of macromolecular detachment , or bond rupturing .",
    "an example of this rapidly developing field is the accelerated rupturing of bonds upon application of a dynamic load between two macromolecules , such as the ligand - receptor complex biotin - streptavidin @xcite .",
    "the mean times to bond breaking have been measured @xcite and modelled @xcite .",
    "this `` kramers problem '' @xcite , can also be studied as an inverse problem .",
    "bond rupture can be modelled as the irreversible passage of the relevant molecular coordinate @xmath11 over a barrier from a metastable state .",
    "thermal bombardments agitate both the molecular distance coordinate directly and the interaction potential . in the overdamped , or markovian limit , the distance coordinate obeys the langevin equation    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the effective interaction potential of the rupturing bond , and @xmath14 represents a force that arises from a fluctuating potential driven by the white diffusion noise @xmath7 ( again , the appropriate convention is the stratonovich difference rule ) . the _ forward _ problem of bond rupture , or detachment ,",
    "using simple fixed potentials @xmath13 @xcite , and with explicit forms for fluctuating potentials @xcite , have been well - studied .",
    "as soon as it crosses @xmath8 .",
    "we demonstrate that the functional form of the voltage dynamics can be be determined only between @xmath9 and @xmath8 ( the unshaded region ) .",
    "( b ) passage over a metastable barrier .",
    "the first - passage , bond - breaking times can be used to construct the potential @xmath15 and and how it fluctuates ( dashed curve).,height=192 ]    both problems discussed above ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) , as well as many others , can be modeled using a scalar stochastic process where the first - exit time distribution obeys the backward kolmogorov equation .",
    "we show in the following sections , that the measured first - exit time distribution ( given a fixed initial condition ) along with knowledge of the drift and diffusion parameters in part of the domain , is sufficient to uniquely determine one of them in the entire domain provided the other one is known .",
    "our analysis gives a formal procedure for reconstructing drift or diffusion of the stochastic process .",
    "it is based on transforming the equation into a schrdinger type equation and on analytical ( more precisely meromorphic ) continuation of measured data to obtain the spectral data of the schrdinger equation .",
    "although uniqueness is demonstrated in the aforementioned framework , the necessary analytical continuation in the reconstruction shows that the inverse problem is _ severely ill - posed _ @xcite .",
    "consider the general stochastic process    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the wiener measure , and the it interpretation is used @xcite .",
    "the drift term , @xmath18 , is assumed to have sub - linear growth at infinity , and is of class @xmath19 .",
    "we also assume that the variance , @xmath20 , is uniformly bounded from above and below by positive constants , and is of class @xmath21 .",
    "these assumptions are sufficient to ensure that the process ( [ eq : process ] ) admits a unique solution @xcite .    in the application to spiking action potentials in neurons , @xmath22 is the transmembrane voltage at time @xmath23 .",
    "the potential immediately after reset is denoted @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding drift and diffusion terms are defined as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , since ( [ eq : process ] ) is in the it form and ( [ eq : voltage ] ) should be interpreted in the stratonovich sense @xcite . for a more detailed derivation of the the diffusion process in the context of action potential modeling ,",
    "we refer the reader to number of standard works @xcite . in the application",
    "to chemical bond rupturing , @xmath11 denotes the reaction coordinate along an effective molecular energy landscape ( cf .",
    "1(b ) ) , @xmath27 is an initial bond displacement , and we identify the drift in ( [ eq : process ] ) with @xmath28 .",
    "let us now consider the interval @xmath29 and the first exit time @xmath30 of the process @xmath0 ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath30 is the first time of exit of @xmath0 out of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "first exit time measurements can then be used to reconstruct properties of the diffusion process .",
    "for instance , it is known that knowledge of @xmath32 ( the probability that @xmath0 exits @xmath33 at @xmath34 conditional on it starting at @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 $ ] ( the expected time it takes for @xmath0 to exit @xmath33 starting at @xmath11 ) , uniquely determines @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we refer to breiman @xcite for details on the so - called _ natural time scale _ and _ speed measure _ of diffusion processes .    in the applications presented here ,",
    "the situation is different : we have access to the full distribution of the first - exit times , but _ only _ for processes starting at @xmath39 ( the reset potential or the initial relative molecular coordinate ) .",
    "the distribution of the exit times can be conveniently written as the solution to a partial differential equation ( the backward kolmogorov equation)@xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath40 the laplace transform ( from the time variable @xmath23 to the dual variable @xmath41 ) of the probability density @xmath42 of the first - exit times @xmath23 from @xmath43 of the diffusion process starting at @xmath44 . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume reflecting boundary conditions for the diffusion at @xmath45 , and consider termination of the process only at @xmath2 .",
    "following @xcite , we find that @xmath40 solves the following backward kolmogorov equation ,    @xmath46    where @xmath47 corresponds to vanishing probability flux at @xmath45 .",
    "although we restrict our analysis to a reflecting lower bound , depending on the physical application , other boundary conditions can be imposed at an arbitrary lower bound .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath48 reflects the fact that @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath50 is directly measured , @xmath51 is exactly determined for all @xmath52 . using an affine change of variables , @xmath53 , we rescale the domain to @xmath54 $ ] and recast eq .",
    "( [ eq : wx0 ] ) as    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is now the initial position of the process .",
    "we still use the notation @xmath38 and @xmath37 for the diffusion and drift terms in the rescaled variables .",
    "for example , in the neuron spiking problem , the voltage threshold is at @xmath57 , the inhibitory threshold ( the lower bound for the voltage ) is at @xmath58 , and the reset voltage that restarts the process is at @xmath59 .",
    "this problem admits a unique solution provided @xmath38 remains uniformly bounded from above and below and @xmath37 remains bounded .    in many instances @xmath60 and @xmath61 are known from a well - accepted model , and the function @xmath62 can be computed directly .",
    "now consider the case where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are unknown , but @xmath63 is _ measured _ at a single initial position @xmath64 .",
    "what can one reconstruct ( with respect to @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) from a knowledge of @xmath65 for all @xmath52 ?",
    "in answering this question , we arrive at the following :    let @xmath66 be the point defined in ( [ bcond ] ) below and let @xmath67 be a countable set of lebesgue measure @xmath58 in @xmath68 , defined in ( [ eq : countset ] ) below .",
    "we obtained the following related results :    [ thm:1 ] assume that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are known on @xmath69 and that the measurement point @xmath70 . if , in addition , either @xmath60 , @xmath61 , or @xmath71 is known entirely on @xmath72 $ ] , then both @xmath60 and @xmath61 are uniquely determined on @xmath72 $ ] by measurement of @xmath65 , for all @xmath52 .",

    "both theorems say that if either @xmath37 or @xmath38 is known on @xmath72 $ ] , while the other is known only on half of the domain , we can reconstruct this other function also on the entire domain . since @xmath75 is implicitly defined by @xmath38 ( cf .",
    ". [ bcond ] ) , it is an _ a priori _ constraint on the size of the domain that one can reconstruct from the measurements @xmath65 . in theorem 1 , the measurements are made at an almost arbitrary point @xmath76 .",
    "we have to remove a countable set of points , which is also defined implicitly as it depends on @xmath38 and @xmath37 .",
    "this constraint is no longer necessary in theorem 2 , when @xmath77 .",
    "the conclusions of both results hold true if the domains @xmath69 and @xmath73 of _ a priori _ knowledge of the coefficients are replaced by @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively with @xmath80 in the latter case .",
    "we do not explicitly consider these cases .",
    "the main steps of the proof are the following .",
    "first we use a transformation similar to the liouville transformation ( used to obtain the canonical form of sturm - liouville problems @xcite ) to map eq .",
    "( [ eq : wx ] ) into a schrdinger equation ( section [ sec : sch ] ) .",
    "next , we show that a measurement of @xmath65 , for all @xmath52 , is sufficient to obtain a single eigenvalue spectrum of the sturm - liouville problem ( when @xmath81 in the setting of theorem 1 ) .",
    "this allows us to use results from gelfand and levitan @xcite to verify uniqueness of the reconstruction ( section [ sec : rec ] ) and explicitly extract @xmath60 or @xmath61 ( section [ sec : recfinal ] ) .",
    "the above theorems require to know the coefficients on half of the domain before one of them can be reconstructed on the other half .",

    "we can now apply the rest of the proof of theorem [ thm:2 ] on the interval @xmath250 .",
    "this allows us to reconstruct @xmath37 and @xmath38 uniquely on @xmath250 .",
    "similarly the knowledge of @xmath37 and @xmath38 on @xmath251 allows us to reconstruct both coefficients uniquely on @xmath252 and the same knowledge on @xmath73 allows reconstruction on @xmath68 .",
    "this concludes the proof of the theorem .",
    "theorems [ thm:1 ] , [ thm:2 ] , and [ thm:4 ] provide an explicit method to reconstruct the drift and diffusion coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 from the measurements .",
    "this method is based on three steps .",
    "the first step consists of finding the poles of meromorphic functions of the form @xmath123 at fixed @xmath150 from its knowledge for @xmath52 . in the second step ,",
    "the potential @xmath112 is reconstructed from the knowledge of the spectral data provided in step 1 .",
    "finally @xmath60 and @xmath61 are reconstructed from @xmath112 by solving first - order ordinary differential equations .",
    "step 3 is well - posed in the sense that noise in the potential @xmath112 are at most linearly amplified in the reconstruction of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "step 2 is also well posed as the reconstruction of the potential @xmath112 from the spectra is stable , for instance in the sense that an error of order @xmath212 on the @xmath253 norm of @xmath254 in ( [ eigenwkb ] ) implies an error also of order @xmath212 in the reconstruction of @xmath194 in the @xmath255 sense @xcite .",
    "step 1 , however , is severely ill - posed in the sense that order-@xmath212 errors in the measured generate errors greater than order @xmath256 ( for all @xmath257 ) in the @xmath253 norm of the coefficients @xmath254 in ( [ eigenwkb ] ) .",
    "this is a similar result to the reconstruction of diffusion coefficients from boundary measurements , which is known to be severely ill - posed @xcite .",
    "we can show a hlder - type stability result in the reconstruction of each eigenvalue .",
    "this means that for each eigenvalue @xmath193 , there exists @xmath258 such that errors in the data of order @xmath212 yield an error of order @xmath259 on the reconstruction .",
    "unfortunately , the prefactor in front of @xmath259 grows exponentially in @xmath160 so that at most only approximately @xmath260 eigenvalues can be reconstructed from oder-@xmath212 accurate measured data .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the results on the meromorphic prolongation of functions with poles , as shown by k. miller @xcite .",
    "since we do not attack the numerical reconstruction here we briefly sketch the result and how it may be used to derive the above stability estimates .",
    "let us consider the open disk @xmath261 of radius @xmath262 and center @xmath58 in the complex plane and a meromorphic function @xmath263 inside that disk with @xmath264 poles , which we assume lie on the segment @xmath265 .",
    "we want to reconstruct these @xmath264 poles from the measurement of the meromorphic function on the segment @xmath266 .",
    "let us define by @xmath267 the function that takes the value @xmath58 on @xmath268 , the value @xmath57 on @xmath269 , and is harmonic on @xmath270 .",
    "one verifies that @xmath271 on @xmath270 .",
    "let us recast our meromorphic function as @xmath272 where @xmath273 is analytic on @xmath261 .",
    "we assume that @xmath274 here @xmath275 are our measurements .",
    "the above relation indicates what we mean by error in the measurements and essentially says that @xmath276 is bounded by @xmath212 in the supremum norm . upon slightly modifying the proof of theorem 1 in @xcite",
    ", we obtain that it is possible to reconstruct the poles @xmath193 of @xmath102 on @xmath261 with an error of order @xmath277 here we have bounded @xmath278 by @xmath279 on @xmath261 . in the case of interest in this paper , we have that @xmath280 the radius is chosen as roughly @xmath281 . at the boundary @xmath282 of the domain , we observe that @xmath283 is bounded by ( using stirling s approximation ) @xmath284 using these values we find that @xmath285 for some positive constant @xmath286 .",
    "the above constraint is sharp @xcite .",
    "this shows that the reconstruction of any eigenvalue is hlder continuous , where the order of continuity @xmath287 .",
    "this is therefore a mildly ill - posed problem .",
    "however , although the reconstruction of each eigenvalue is mildly ill - posed , collectively the reconstruction of the whole spectrum is severely ill - posed if one wants an approximation in the @xmath253 sense .",
    "indeed for a given noise level @xmath212 , the above formula shows that we can only reconstruct a number of eigenvalues that is proportional to @xmath260 , for the reconstructed information becomes useless as @xmath288 and the corresponding coefficients @xmath254 in ( [ eigenwkb ] ) are not reconstructed at all . now assuming that @xmath289 , which is the best we can expect , we observe that @xmath290 for @xmath291 .",
    "this shows that the reconstruction of the potential @xmath112 is severely ill - posed .",
    "indeed let us assume that the asymptotic coefficient of @xmath174 in ( [ eigenwkb ] ) are of the form @xmath292 for some @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath253 error on the fourier coefficients obtained by truncating all coefficients of index greater than @xmath293 is then of order @xmath294 .",
    "we have shown that if @xmath37 and @xmath38 are known in say , @xmath295 $ ] , with @xmath296 ( eq . [ bcond ] ) , one of them can be reconstructed from a single first - exit time distribution measurement at @xmath297 .",
    "the procedure is formally carried out by transforming the backward kolmogorov equation for the first - exit time distribution @xmath62 into a schrdinger equation in @xmath147 with a potential @xmath112 that is a functional of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "if this potential is known in the domain @xmath298 , @xmath112 can be reconstructed from the single eigenvalue spectrum obtained by analytically continuing the solution @xmath147 ( in @xmath41 ) and finding the poles .",
    "it is this pole - finding procedure that is severely ill - posed .",
    "the asymptotic limit of the eigenvalues also determine the extent of the transformed domain @xmath132 . from the reconstructed @xmath112",
    ", one can reconstruct @xmath60 or @xmath61 , only if the other ( or @xmath71 ) is also known .",
    "finally , we have shown that the measurement process and the determination of spectra can be repeated a sufficient number of times to obtain @xmath112 ( theorem 3 ) and @xmath37 or @xmath38 ( theorem 4 ) on the entire domain provided @xmath112 and @xmath38 or @xmath37 is initially known on a small interval @xmath299 .",
    "our analysis in section [ sec : impl ] shows that the proposed inversion is severely ill - posed even if the hypotheses of the aforementioned theorems are satisfied .",
    "however the reconstruction of partial spectral data is mildly ill - posed so we believe the proposed method can be implemented .",
    "let us conclude with the following remark .",
    "our method is based on reconstructing the eigenvalues @xmath193 from the knowledge of @xmath300 .",
    "the latter may however provide additional information .",
    "for instance we observe from ( [ ee ] ) that the residuals @xmath301 can also be reconstructed from the measured data .",
    "it is known that the measurement of one spectrum @xmath302 may be sufficient to uniquely reconstruct @xmath112 on the whole interval @xmath143 provided that additional normalization conditions be also measured on the eigenfunctions @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether additional information on @xmath301 may be useful .",
    "preliminary numerical simulations seem to show that reconstructions from a single measurement only allows us to reconstruct part of the potential .",
