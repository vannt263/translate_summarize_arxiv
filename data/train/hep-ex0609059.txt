    "the probability not to detect all direct @xmath25 annihilation photons was suppressed to @xmath26 using a thick hermetic crystal calorimeter , minimizing the dead material and with a good energy resolution .",
    "the probability to loose all photons in 3@xmath27 decays is consequently even smaller .",

    "a method was developed to suppress the background from the electrons emitted in the ec process ( shake - off electrons ) .",
    "an efficient identification of the 1.27  mev photon emitted by the @xmath28na radioactive source was achieved with a method to veto the charged particles entering the trigger counter , thus , the backgrounds related to them could be reduced .",

    "_ _ ]    photons from the direct @xmath25 annihilation in flight or from the positronium decays were detected in a hermetic , segmented bgo calorimeter ( the ecal ) .",
    "two endcap counters called tbgo and fbgo ( see figures  [ detector]-[opsregion ] ) surrounded the target on each side . at the analysis level",
    "the 1.27  mev photon ( `` the triggering photon '' ) was required to be identified in the tbgo counter .",
    "the calorimeter was instrumented with charge and time readout .",
    "the activity of the source was chosen to maximize the trigger rate versus the inefficiency of signal detection ( mostly due to pileup events ) .",
    "the source was prepared by evaporating drops of a @xmath28na solution directly on a 100 @xmath40 m thick and 2x8  mm@xmath41 wide plastic scintillator ( see figure  [ fiber ] ) fabricated by squeezing a 500 @xmath40 m diameter scintillating fiber ( bicron bf-12 ) . in this way , no dead material was introduced for a source holder .",

    "the coincidence of the two pmt signals was used to tag the passage of a positron through the fiber and acted as a start signal for the data readout system .",
    "the use of two pmts in coincidence , instead of a single one @xcite , lowered the ratio between fake and real positron triggers to @xmath42 .",
    "opposite to the source , a 4x8x8  mm@xmath43 sio@xmath44 aerogel piece ( type sp30 , purchased from matsushita electric works ) was placed in contact with the squeezed fiber ( see figure  [ opsregion ] and [ fbgofiber ] ) .",
    "positrons stopping in the aerogel target may form positronium ( the formation probability is @xmath45 @xcite ) which can migrate into the aerogel pores .",
    "the collisions with the walls of the pores did not appreciably quench the @xmath9 : when the aerogel was flushed with nitrogen , a fit to the distribution of the time difference between the start from the fiber and the stop from the calorimeter yielded @xmath46 ns , which is very close to the lifetime in vacuum @xmath47 ns @xcite .",
    "the ecal was composed of 100 bgo crystals that surrounded the target region providing a nearly isotropic sphere of radius 200 - 220  mm ( see figure  [ detector ] ) .",
    "each crystal had a hexagonal cross - section of 61  mm diameter and a length of 200  mm .",
    "the crystals of the inner most ring were wrapped in a 2 @xmath40 m thick aluminized mylar foil to minimize the photon energy absorption .",
    "the other crystals were wrapped with teflon foils of 750 @xmath40 m thickness .",
    "the crystals in the barrel and the fbgo were readout with etl 9954 photomultiplier tubes .",
    "the energy deposited in the fiber is an important parameter in order to reject the background from the electrons emitted in the ec process ( shake - off electrons , see section [ bkg ] ) .",
    "the mean number of photoelectrons detected in each xp2020 for a positron crossing the fiber was measured to be about 1.2 , thus , a cut on the energy deposited in the fiber using these signals would not be meaningful .",
    "for this reason the fbgo was also used to measure the energy deposited in the fiber by the positron : the light emitted by the fiber could traverse the transparent aerogel and enter the fbgo through an aperture in the wrapping on its front face .",
    "this light was then guided by the fbgo to the pmt attached on the back face of fbgo ( as illustrated in figure  [ fbgofiber ] ) .",
    "this method provided a mean number of photoelectrons equal to 13@xmath48 for a positron traversing the fiber @xcite .",
    "the tbgo endcap was used in the off - line analysis to identify the 1.27  mev photon .",
    "the energy resolution of the tbgo was an essential parameter to reduce backgrounds related to the misidentification of the 1.27  mev photon ( see also section [ bkg ] ) . to provide a better energy resolution ,",
    "this crystal was coupled to an etl 9964 pmt with a more uniform light collection and a larger quantum efficiency than the etl 9954 .",
    "for the same reason this crystal was of a better quality than the others and efforts were dedicated to maximize the light collection by keeping the amount of dead material introduced by the crystal wrapping as small as possible .",
    "the best results were achieved with the crystal wrapped in the 3 m radiant mirror ( 64 @xmath40 m thickness ) : the resolution at 662  kev was measured to be about @xmath49 ( fwhm ) . to select the triggering photon , an energy window @xmath50 $ ]  kev was used in the analysis . in addition , to veto charged particles ( positrons and electrons ) entering the tbgo , a 1  mm thick plastic scintillator ( bicron bc-400 )",
    "was optically coupled to the tbgo front face ( for more details see @xcite ) , i.e. the same pmt was used to detect the light signals from the plastic scintillator and the tbgo crystal ( see section [ bkg ] for a discussion of backgrounds associated to charged particles entering the tbgo ) .",
    "the signals from the plastic scintillator and the bgo could be distinguished because of the different decay time ( @xmath51 = 2.7  ns for the plastic scintillator and @xmath35 300  ns for the bgo ) . for this purpose ,",
    "split signals from the pmt were fed into two adcs with different integration gates ( called short gate and long gate ) .",
    "a vme system interfaced to a pc was used for data acquisition ( the daq rate was about 1800 events / s ) . for every trigger ,",
    "five caen 32 channels qdc v792 modules recorded the charge of the crystal signals while a caen tdc v775 recorded the time information .",
    "a trigger gate length of 2.9 @xmath40s was chosen to keep the probability of @xmath9  to decay after this time to @xmath52 .",
    "a temperature stabilized light - tight box containing the calorimeter was built in order to keep the temperature of the bgo crystals in the range of @xmath53c .",
    "water , whose temperature was controlled by two thermostats , circulated through copper tubes welded on two copper plates inside the box .",
    "the experimental hall was air conditioned to keep temperature variations within @xmath54c .",
    "the high - voltage dividers of all pmts were placed outside the box in order to avoid energy dissipation close to the crystals .",
    "the bgo crystals were equipped with leds that could be pulsed periodically to monitor the response .",
    "additionally , the gains of the pmts were also monitored to check their stability .",
    "the detector was calibrated and monitored internally using the 511  kev annihilation photon and the 1.27  mev photons emitted by the @xmath28na source .",
    "variations of the energy scale during the run period were within @xmath55 and corrected on the basis of an internal calibration procedure @xcite .",
    "in order to reach the required sensitivity , the background must be reduced and controlled at the level of @xmath56 . to understand the different background sources and to cross - check the simulation , we perfomed an engineering run with a simplified version of our detector . during two months of data taking ,",
    "the stability of the detector and its components was investigated .",
    "the comparison between the background expected based on monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and the data of the engineering run is summarized in table  [ bkgtbl ] .",
    "the ecal thickness of 200  mm provides a probability of @xmath57 for two 511  kev photons to escape detection ( see background 1 in table  [ bkgtbl ] ) . for three photons",
    "decays , this probability is consequently even smaller .",
    "if one ( or more ) annihilation photon ( e.g. backscattered from the target ) overlaps with the 1.27  mev in the tbgo , it can fall in the trigger energy window @xmath50 $ ]  kev because of the finite energy resolution .",
    "this introduces a background if the remaining annihilation photon gets absorbed in the dead material or escapes detection .",
    "the separation between the upper bound of the trigger energy window and the sum of a triggering and a 511 kev photon was , thanks to the good energy resolution of the tbgo , 7@xmath58 of the 1786 kev peak ( 1275 + 511 kev ) .",
    "thus , the level of this background is @xmath59 ( background 2 in table  [ bkgtbl ] ) .    in order to suppress the other sources of background related to the misidentification of the 1.27 mev photon ( backgrounds 3 , 4 and 5 listed in table  [ bkgtbl ] ) , one had to veto charged particles entering the tbgo .",
    "two processes are responsible for generating such triggers .",
    "one is associated with decay mode b ( ec ) when the 1.27 mev photon interacts in the fiber , faking a positron signal .",
    "if the scattered photon and the compton electron reach the tbgo , the sum of the energy of the two particles can be misidentified as the triggering photon without any energy in the rest of the calorimeter .",
    "another background can occur in decay mode a if the 1.27 mev photon is not detected : a trigger can be produced by a positron that multiple scatters ( ms ) in the fiber and deposits enough energy to trigger the experiment .",
    "if the positron reaches the tbgo with a kinetic energy of about 200 - 300 kev and the two 511 kev annihilation photons are completely absorbed in the tbgo an energy close to 1.27 mev will be reconstructed .",
    "this will appear as an invisible decay since no energy is expected in the rest of the detector .",
    "if the 1.27 mev photon is not present ( decay mode c ) a trigger can similarly be produced by the 1.83 mev positron . to veto these backgrounds the charged particle veto of the tbgo described in the previous section",
    "was used such that the backgrounds 3 , 4 and 5 had a probability of @xmath60 in the final setup .",
    "the ec photon may accidentally coincide with a trigger from the fiber generated either by the pmts noise or by some other particles emitted from possible unstable isotopes formed during the target activation .",
    "the level of this background could be reduced with the selection of two xp 2020 with very low noise ( @xmath61 counts / s ) and the requirement of the coincidence between them .",
    "in addition , a radioactive source with a controlled high purity was chosen . from the data of the engineering run ,",
    "this background was estimated to be @xmath42 ( background 6 in table  [ bkgtbl ] ) .    during the decay mode b ( ec )",
    "the fiber signal can be generated by shake - off electrons ( background 7 in table  [ bkgtbl ] ) . since the probability of an electron ejection steeply drops with its emission kinetic energy ( more than 4 orders of magnitude in the first 100 kev ) the cut on the energy deposited in the fiber by the triggering particles was used to suppress this background .",
    "the engineering run allowed to test these backgrounds as shown in table  [ bkgtbl ] .",
    "the expected fraction of zero energy events is 10@xmath62 smaller than what was measured .",
    "this difference can be explained by the contribution from the shake - off electrons which was not included in the simulation .",
    "indeed , in the engineering run there was no information about the energy deposited in the fiber so that no cut on the energy of the particles passing through the fiber could be applied .",
    "the last column of the table lists the expectations for the final setup .",
    "the total background is estimated to be at the level @xmath56 .",
    "the threshold on the energy deposited in the fiber was set considering the uncertainty due to the number of photoelectrons and the subtraction method to be sure that no electron below 100 kev could trigger the fiber ; it was chosen , based on simulations , to be at 140 kev .",

    "after imposing the above requirements a final sample of 1.41@xmath63 events was obtained . for these events",
    "the energies of all the 100 bgo crystals , except the tbgo , were summed .",
    "figure  [ ecalsum ] shows the spectrum of the total energy ( @xmath64 ) deposited in the ecal .",
    "the peak at 1022 kev corresponds to the positronium mass ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the inset shows that no event is observed in the zero energy region .    to define the upper energy cut on @xmath64 , below which an event is considered as photonless ( invisible ) , a dedicated run of @xmath66 triggers",
    "was performed triggering the experiment only with the 1.27 mev photon and no requirement of the fiber @xcite .",
    "the zero peak contained about 10.4@xmath67 of the events passing the selection cuts defined in section [ sec : datareduction ] .",
    "this value was corrected by a factor 0.8 determined using the mc simulations to take into account the different detection efficiencies of the 1.27 mev photon in the case of the ec process and in the case of the transition with the positron .",
    "the measured value was consistent with the expected fraction of electron capture events ( decay mode b ) .",
    "the cut @xmath68 kev corresponding to the region containing 99@xmath62 of the events in the ec peak at zero energy was used to define the photonless events .    to determine the signal inefficiency ,",
    "mostly due to pileup , @xmath69 events have been collected using a random trigger formed by delaying the fiber coincidence by 16 @xmath40s ( half of the mean time interval between two events ) . for the 80 kev threshold defined above",
    ", this gave an inefficiency of @xmath70 that was consistent with the prediction of the simulation .",
    "this inefficiency was measured at the beginning of the data taking and , conservatively , was not corrected for the reduction of the source intensity during that period .    for the fbgo , the broadening of the pedestal due to the contribution of energy deposited in the fiber had to be considered .",
    "the energy of the two 511 kev annihilation photons was localized in two opposite - located crystals of the barrel and then the fbgo pedestal was built .",
    "this resulted in a correction of 1@xmath62 in the efficiency of zero signal detection .",
    "finally , the signal efficiency was estimated to be @xmath71 .",
    "the mean fraction of @xmath9  in the data sample could be evaluated from the decay time curve by fitting the observed distribution to the function @xmath72 ( @xmath73 is the accidental background ) starting from the time @xmath74 ns when @xmath9  was completely thermalized in the target @xcite . after taking into account the estimated difference of efficiency for 2 and 3 gamma detection and the pick - off effect ( measured from the lifetime spectra with the same method as described in ref.@xcite ) ,",
    "the fraction of @xmath9  in the data sample was @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "since in the signal region no zero energy events were observed the upper limit for the branching ratio @xcite is :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the number of @xmath9  in the selected sample",
    ". figure  [ ecalsum ] shows the extrapolation into the region of the zero signal with an exponential .",
    "the integral from 0 to 80 kev of the function obtained from the fit gives an evaluation of the background contribution in this region .",
    "the result is @xmath78 expected events , where the error was evaluated from the uncertainty related to the extrapolation procedure itself .",
    "this experiment can also be used to obtain upper limits on @xmath79 and on @xmath80 . for this purpose",
    "the different probabilities of positrons stopping in the fiber and in the aerogel were calculated with the help of simulations .",
    "several papers were reviewed in ref.@xcite concluding that the probability to form positronium ( 75@xmath62 of o - ps and 25@xmath62 of p - ps ) per positron stopping is about 0.45 in the aerogel and between 0.2 and 0.4 in the fiber . in the aerogel a fraction of 0.05 to 0.1 of the p - ps atoms experience pick - off annihilation in about 2 ns before escaping out of the silica grains in the pores . for o - ps",

    "the fraction of positrons stopping in the fiber is 0.43 and in the aerogel is 0.25 , therefore , the smallest possible fraction of p - ps decays ( including pick - off ) is @xmath81 .",
