    "spectral broadening originates from complex mechanisms that drive the long - range propagation of ultrashort pulses , when they form narrow filaments in optically - transparent media .",
    "the physics of isolated femtosecond filaments in air is nowadays rather well understood ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it involves the competition between kerr self - focusing and plasma defocusing , triggered whenever the input pulse power exceeds the critical power for self - focusing @xmath0 . here",
    ", @xmath1 is the central laser wavelength , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the linear and nonlinear refraction indices in air , respectively . for high enough powers , multiple filaments nucleated after an early stage of modulational instability",
    "have also been widely investigated @xcite .",
    "they produce spectral patterns mostly analogous to those generated by a single filament , as filamentary cells emerge in phase from the background field and possess the same phase link @xcite . by comparing terawatt ( tw ) multifilamented beams with gigawatt ( gw ) single filaments in air ,",
    "this property was again verified in the uv - visible region ( 230 - 500  nm ) , where femtosecond self - focusing pulses centered at 800 nm generically produce a tremendous plateau of wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this latter phenomenon has recently become a subject of inspiration for several researchers .",
    "two scenarios have been proposed for justifying the build - up of new wavelengths in the uv - visible range .",
    "on the one hand , temporal steepening phenomena undergone by the pump were shown to deeply modify the filament spectrum @xcite .",
    "full chromatic dispersion included in the optical field wave number @xmath4 affects both the diffraction operator and the nonlinearities .",
    "this induces shock - like dynamics at the back edge of the pulse through space - time focusing and self - steepening effects , which strongly  blueshift  the spectra . on the other hand , spectral broadening",
    "becomes enhanced by harmonic generation .",
    "the coupling of th with an infrared ( ir ) pump produces a  two - colored ",
    "filament from pump intensities above 10  tw/@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the amount of pump energy transferred into th radiation depends on the linear wave vector mismatch parameter @xmath6^{-1}$ ] fixing the coherence length @xmath7 .",
    "the smaller the coherence length , the weaker th fields . along",
    "meter - range distances , the th component can stabilize the pump wave with about @xmath8 conversion efficiency @xcite .",
    "experimental and numerical data reported ring structures embarking most of the th energy and having a half - divergence angle of about 0.5  mrad @xcite .",
    "this process contributes to create a continuous spectral band of uv - visible wavelengths @xcite .    resembling spectral dynamics",
    "have also been reported from 1-mj infrared pulses propagating in argon at atmospheric pressure , after subsequent compression by chirped mirrors @xcite .",
    "simulations of these experiments @xcite , discarding th emission , revealed that temporal gradients inherent to the steepening operators are sufficient to amplify uv shifts and cover the th bandwidth down to 250 and 210  nm for initial pulse durations of 10 and 6  fs , respectively .",
    "very recently , numerical simulations @xcite refound this tendency for atmospheric propagation , i.e. , th generation , while it affects the pump dynamics to some extent over long ranges , does not change significantly sc spectra , whose variations are mostly induced by the fundamental field in air .",
    "despite these last results , we are still missing a detailed understanding of the key parameters which are supposed to drive sc generation .",
    "a first important parameter is , of course , the laser wavelength itself : how does the supercontinuum evolve when @xmath1 is varied ?",
    "this question was addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite for various laser wavelengths , at which some spectral components were seen to merge . however , the model used a two - envelope approximation ( for the pump and th fields , separately ) .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , splitting into th and sc pump within envelopes becomes problematic when their respective spectra overlap inside a wide frequency interval where the basic validity condition @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) may no longer be fulfilled .",
    "actually , th radiation produced through the nonlinear polarization needs to be described self - consistently from a single equation governing the total real optical field .",
    "this model was missing in refs .",
    "@xcite , which made the role of th overestimated in the white light emission .",
    "another important parameter is the length of the self - guiding range : successive cycles of focusing and defocusing events promote the creation of shorter peaks in the pulse temporal profile and lead to a maximal extension of the spectrum .",
    "a third potential player is the input pulse duration . in @xcite ,",
    "this was shown to affect the spectra in noble gases for pulses containing a few optical cycles mainly . clearing this aspect requires several simulations using distinct pulse durations and exploiting different propagation ranges . in connection , we demonstrate that spectral enlargements are directly linked to the level of maximum intensity : steepening operators as well as th radiation broaden all the more the spectra as the intensity in the filament is high .    the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ model_equations ] presents the model equations , namely , a unidirectional propagation equation for the total electric field that generates higher - order harmonics ( mostly th ) through kerr nonlinearities .",
    "results from this equation will be compared with those inferred from the  standard  nonlinear evolution equation ( nee ) for the pump wave .",
    "the major difference between these two models lies in the production of the th field and its coupling with the pump wave .",
