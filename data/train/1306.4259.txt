    "problems of electrokinetics have recently attracted a great deal of attention due to rapid developments in micro- , nano- and biotechnology . among the numerous modern applications of electrokinetics are micropumps , biological cells , electropolishing of mono- and polycrystalline aluminum , and the growth of aluminum oxide layers for creating micro- and nanoscale regular structures such as quantum dots and wires .",
    "the study of the space charge in the electric double - ion layer in an electrolyte solution between semi - selective ion - exchange membranes under a potential drop is a fundamental problem of modern physics , first addressed by helmholtz .",
    "the first theoretical investigation of the regime of limiting currents was done in the works by grafov and chernenko @xcite , smyrl and newman @xcite and dukhin and deryagin @xcite .",
    "rubinstein and shtilman @xcite described the regime of limiting currents ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "hydrodynamics is not involved in either the underlimiting or limiting regime , and both regimes are one - dimensional .",
    "a  curious electrokinetic instability and pattern formation were theoretically predicted by rubinstein and zaltzman [ , ] as a bifurcation to overlimiting regimes , which also makes the solution two - dimensional .",
    "rubinstein , staude and kedem @xcite found experimentally that the transition to the overlimiting regime was accompanied by current oscillations .",
    "these facts indirectly indicated a correlation between the instability and overlimiting currents .",
    "this correlation was also demonstrated in maletzki et al .",
    "@xcite , belova et al .",
    "@xcite , and rubinstein et al .",
    "@xcite , where the overlimiting regimes were eliminated when instability was artificially suppressed .",
    "the first direct experimental proof of the electroconvective instability that arises with an increasing potential drop between the bulk ion - selective membranes was reported by rubinstein et al .",
    "@xcite , who managed to show the existence of small vortices near the membrane surface .",
    "yossifon and chang  @xcite also observed an array of electroconvective vortices arising under the effect of a slow alternating electric field , while kim et al .",
    "@xcite found a nonequilibrium vortices dc field . a  unified theoretical description of electrokinetic instability , valid for all three regimes ,",
    "was presented by zaltzman and rubinstein @xcite , based on a systematic asymptotic analysis of the problem .",
    "the numerical analysis of the nonlinear regimes of the electrokinetic instability was developed in @xcite .",
    "the self - similar character of the initial stage of the evolution and instability of the self - similar solution were investigated in @xcite .",
    "the fundamental interest in the problem is connected with a novel type of electrohydrodynamic instability : electrokinetic instability .",
    "this instability triggers a hydrodynamic flow and , in turn , intensifies the ion flux , which is responsible for the overlimiting currents .",
    "although the cells observed in the electroconvective motion look like the cells in rayleigh - bnard convection and bnard - marangoni thermoconvection , the electroconvective instability is much more complicated from both the physical and the mathematical points of view .",
    "the reynolds number in the electrokinetic instability is very small and , hence , the dissipation is very large and the nonlinear terms in navier - stokes system are negligibly small .",
    "the nonlinearity responsible for bifurcation arises from other equations of the system ( nernst - planck - poisson - stokes  system ) .",
    "this explains the dramatic distinction between the chaotic motion in the macro- and microhydrodynamics .",
    "the electrohydrodynamics of the electrolytes between the membranes manifests new types of bifurcation and transition to chaos , developed in both micro- and nanoscales .",
    "in particular , the large dissipation of the system should suppress its oscillatory motion , in particular , hopf bifurcation . in fig .",
    "[ vnic1 ] , the results of experiments @xcite do not reveal any of the regular sinusoidal behavior that is characteristic near a hopf bifurcation point .",
    "solutions at different ratios of the current density to its limiting value : 1   1.5 ; 2   2.5 ; 3   3.6 @xcite ]      during the last decades , direct numerical simulations have been recognized as a powerful and reliable tool for studying many classical hydrodynamical problems , in particular , for modeling laminar  turbulent transitions and chaotic turbulent flows .",
    "it is then logical to apply this tool to study electrokinetic instability .",
    "the system of the nernst - planck - poisson - stokes  equations has a small parameter , the debye number , at the highest derivatives . as a result , a thin space charge region with a rapid changing of the unknowns",
    "is formed near the surface .",
    "this causes significant difficulties for its numerical solution .",
    "these difficulties are compounded by the complexity of the chaotic regime when the flow contains a wide range of different scales .",
    "there are two approaches to overcoming these difficulties .",
    "the first one is semi - analytical , when the solution in the extended space charge region is sought analytically as the inner expansion but numerically in the diffusion region which is treated as the outer expansion , with a proper matching of the inner and outer expansions , see [ , ] .",
    "the second approach solves the entire system of nernst - planck - poisson - stokes equations numerically , without any simplification . in this case",
    ", the extensive experience of turbulent flow simulation for the navier - stokes equations can be employed .    in our previous works ,",
    "[ , ] , a quasi - spectral discretization with fourier series and chebyshev polynomials was applied in the spatial directions ; this method happened to be computer time consuming . in the present work ,",
    "a special finite - difference scheme with a grid point accumulation in the extended space charge region near the wall has been developed .",
    "spatial discretization with fine resolution leads to stiff problems and requires implicit methods for time advancement .",
    "fully implicit methods produce a set of nonlinear coupled equations for the problem variables on the new time level , and are usually prohibitively costly for long - term calculations .",
    "semi - implicit methods , in which only a part of the operator is treated implicitly , constitute a reasonable compromise for this class of problems .",
    "a  semi - implicit three - step runge - kutta scheme with third - order accuracy in time was adopted from @xcite , where it was applied to the unsteady navier - stokes equations .",
    "the scheme is supplied with a built - in local accuracy estimation and time - step control algorithm .",
    "the idea of the time - step control algorithm is not novel .",
    "it was first utilized in semi - implicit runge - kutta schemes for the navier - stokes equations in [ , ] .",
    "having been extensively exploited for a period of about 10 years , it proved itself to be efficient and convenient , especially for flows with wide variations in characteristic time scales , for instance , in simulations of laminar  turbulent transitions .",
    "the results of the extensive numerical simulation are discussed and understood from the viewpoint of bifurcation theory .",
    "two kinds of initial conditions have been considered : artificial monochromatic perturbations and white noise initial conditions to mimic natural room disturbances .",
    "the context of the present work is the set of attractors of a high dimensional dynamical system generated by the original nernst - planck - poisson - stokes  equations .",
    "the averaged electric current and its time derivative have been taken as a representative low dimensional projection to describe the behavior of the whole system , its transitions , and attractors .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows . in part",
    "2 , the governing equations for the dilute electrolyte , the nernst - planck - poisson - stokes  system , along with the relevant boundary and initial conditions ( of two kinds ) are presented in dimensionless form and typical characteristic values of the system parameters are evaluated .",
    "part  3 describes the details of the finite - difference scheme with respect to both the spatial variables and time .",
    "the selection of the domain length and discretization of the initial conditions are discussed at the end of part  3 .",
    "part  4 presents the results of the numerical simulation , and they are then discussed from the viewpoint of bifurcation theory and hydrodynamic stability .",
    "the potential drop @xmath1 is taken as a control parameter , and the bifurcation points and corresponding regimes are investigated in terms of this parameter . at the end of this part ,",
    "the results of the simulation are qualitatively compared with experiments .",
    "part  5 summarizes and discusses the research , and presents the main conclusions .",
    "a  symmetric , binary electrolyte with a diffusivity of cations and anions @xmath2 , dynamic viscosity @xmath3 and electric permittivity @xmath4 , and bounded by an ideal , semi - selective ion - exchange membrane surfaces , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , is considered .",

    "direct quantitative comparison with experimental data is complicated by many reasons , maybe the main reason is that it is difficult to take into account all the experimental factors involved . still we will try to evaluate the experimental and theoretical data",
    ".    only the paper @xcite contains time series of variables ( chronopotentiometric curves ) and , in qualitative agreement with our simulations , experimental time series do not show regular periodic oscillations , sinusoidal or close to sinusoidal : there is no evidence of hopf bifurcation in experiments .     and @xmath16 ; i , ii and iii stand for underlimiting , limiting and overlimiting currents , respectively ; the triangles corresponds to experiments @xcite and the solid line corresponds to our simulations .",

    "the results of direct numerical simulation of electrokinetic instability , described by the system of the nernst - planck - poisson - stokes  equations , were presented .",
    "two kinds of initial conditions were applied : ( a )  white noise initial conditions were taken to mimic `` room disturbances '' and the subsequent natural evolution of the solution ; ( b )  an artificial monochromatic ion distribution with a fixed wave number was used to create steady coherent structures .",
    "the results were discussed and understood from the viewpoint of bifurcation theory and the theory of hydrodynamic instability . the following sequence of attractors and bifurcations was observed as the drop of potential between the selective surfaces increased : stationary point  homoclinic contour  limit cycle  chaotic motion ; this sequence does not include hopf bifurcation .",
    "the threshold of electroconvective movement , @xmath23 , and the origin of electroconvective vortices were found by the linear spectral stability theory which results were confirmed by the numerical simulation of the nernst - planck - poisson - stokes system . for a small supercriticality",

    "all the steady vortices become unstable via real eigenvalues .",
    "the new attractor is characterized by aperiodic oscillations when the solution for a long time looks like a steady 2d electroconvective vortex , but eventually the neighboring spikes of the space charge either rapidly coalesce or disintegrate to return to the electoconvective quasi - steady structure .",
    "such a scenario repeats itself many times , forming in the proper phase space a so called stable homoclinic contour .    with further increase of @xmath26 ,",
