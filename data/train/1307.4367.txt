    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is a well - studied model of low - dimensional transport of particles with hard - core interactions .",
    "this model has become a standard tool in the context of low - dimensional transport , and it is commonly used to represent the motion of molecular motors or more generally enzymes along cytoskeletal fibers .",
    "it is interesting to recall that the asep was originally proposed in 1968 as a model of the kinetics of biopolymerisation in rna templates @xcite .",
    "since then , the asep has been extensively studied and it has achieved the status of a paradigm in statistical physics ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is fair to say that the asep is one of the simplest non - trivial models of a non - equilibrium process : it is an interacting @xmath1-body system without detailed balance , which reaches a non - gibbsian stationary state with non - vanishing currents . in the last forty years",
    ", exact solutions for the asep in various contexts have been obtained thanks to increasingly sophisticated and elegant mathematical methods @xcite .",
    "conversely , these theoretical studies together with experimental progresses in micro - manipulations have triggered a renewed interest in biophysical applications of the asep in recent years @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the presence of a non - vanishing current in a stationary state results in the transport of information from one part of a system to another , leading to long - range correlations . henceforth , the behavior of the asep is highly sensitive to boundary couplings or to the presence of local defects . in particular",
    ", the asep can undergo boundary induced transitions even in one dimension @xcite , which can not occur in one - dimensional equilibrium systems with short range interactions .",
    "hence , simple deformations of the asep are often very challenging .",
    "these models are important since they enable us to gain insight into macroscopic and microscopic behaviors .",
    "one such seemingly innocent generalization is to introduce blockages .",
    "this is easy to realize for the asep on a periodic one - dimensional lattice where particles undergo a biased nearest - neighbor hopping to empty sites ; if the ring is homogeneous a stationary state with all permissible configuration being equiprobable is reached ( on the macroscopic level , the density is uniform in the stationary state ) .",
    "suppose that the hopping rate between one pair of neighboring sites is suppressed by a certain factor .",
    "this inhomogeneous model with two parameters ( the suppression factor and the average density ) is a well - known challenge that has not been exactly solved @xcite ; see @xcite for a review and recent progress .",
    "the chief message is clear : a local change of the environment ( one special blockage bond ) can result in a global change , namely the system segregates into high- and low - density phases .",
    "however , details of the density profiles as well as the stationary - state correlations are still unknown @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider a variant of the asep on a one - dimensional lattice , namely on a ring with @xmath2 sites .",
    "the total number of particles @xmath1 is conserved by dynamics .",
    "the system is assumed to be homogeneous apart from one special site from which the particle can _ fly _ to any other site . hence in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite we investigate the effect of a special site rather than a special bond .",
    "our basic motivation is to define a simple model with _ unique _",
    "parameter , the average density @xmath3 ( or equivalently the fraction of the vacant sites @xmath4 ) , which can exhibit different regimes with respect to the different values of @xmath5 .",
    "we show that introducing one special site with global hopping generates a non - trivial phase diagram and leads to a subtle selection mechanism of the stationary density profile .",

    "[ sec : smooth ] and [ sec : shock ] , we investigate two types of density profiles that can occur , and we show that naive reasoning does not provide a suitable selection mechanism for the mean - field equations . a more precise analysis ( sec .  [ sec : selection ] ) allows us to establish the phase diagram of the system which , despite the simplicity of the model , turns out to be rather rich . concluding remarks are given in sec .",

    "a particle on site @xmath7 ( @xmath11 ) attempts to hop forward to site @xmath12 with probability @xmath10 ; the attempt is successful only when the target site is empty .",
    "a particle occupying the rightmost site @xmath2 can _ fly _ to any site @xmath13 ; a flying attempt is made with probability @xmath10 and is allowed if the target site ( chosen uniformly at random ) is empty , see fig .",

    "our approach can be extended to a generalized system in which the special site is unique not only since the hopping from this site is global , but also the hopping rate is arbitrary .",
