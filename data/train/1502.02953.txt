    "the above expressions for @xmath15 represent the angle - averaged shear modulus , which reduces to the shear modulus in the isotropic limit of infinite system size .",

    "<S> we will show that as a consequence , one can exploit disorder to achieve a unique , varied , textured and tunable global response .    </S>",

    "<S> this independence refers not only to the dearth of strong correlations between the response of different bonds , but also , and more importantly , to the response of any specific bond to different external perturbations </S>",
    "<S> . we will demonstrate this by constructing selected - bond - removal networks , where individual bonds , or springs , are successively removed to drive the overall system into different regimes of behavior , characterized by ratios of different mechanical responses . </S>",

    "<S> thus , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bond_level_independence]a illustrates a previously - unrecognized property that is very well obeyed by disordered networks : independence of bond - level response .    </S>",
    "<S> this new property suggests that one can tailor the behavior of the network by selectively removing ( pruning ) those bonds that contribute more or less than the average to one of the moduli . by so doing </S>",
    "<S> , one can decrease one modulus with respect to the other .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider the known case of _ rigidity percolation _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where a bond is picked at random and removed . </S>",
    "<S> this pruning is repeated until the system becomes unstable at @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> we have implemented a slight variation to this procedure : at each step , a bond is removed only if each node connected to this bond has at least @xmath24 remaining bonds in @xmath7 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this is the condition for local stability of a particle in the original jammed packing  @xcite . as the excess coordination number decreases , </S>",
    "<S> the bulk and shear moduli vanish together , so that @xmath25  @xcite ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bond_level_independence]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : global_response ] , the ratio @xmath0 is independent of @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now implement the idea of _ selected_-bond removal in a variety of ways . </S>",
    "<S> first we remove the bond with the smallest @xmath8 , namely the weakest contribution to the bulk modulus ( provided , as above , that each node connected to this bond has at least @xmath24 remaining bonds ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the distribution @xmath27 is continuous and nonzero as @xmath28 , the bond removal has almost no effect on the bulk modulus . </S>",
    "<S> however , since there is little correlation between the contribution of each bond to the bulk and shear moduli , there is a much larger effect on the shear modulus . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions @xmath8 and @xmath12 of the remaining bonds to the moduli are then recalculated and the procedure is repeated to remove the bond with the smallest @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : bond_level_independence]b shows that when bonds with the smallest @xmath8 are successively removed , the _ shear _ modulus linearly proportional to @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is quantitatively identical , within numerical precision , to when bonds are removed at random . the ability to alter the scaling of the bulk modulus without affecting the scaling of the shear modulus is a clear demonstration that the principle of independence of bond - level response allows for very precise tuning of global properties . </S>",
    "<S> since removing bonds with the smallest @xmath8 has little effect on the bulk modulus , we would expect @xmath30 as @xmath31 . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : global_response ] , we find that @xmath32 , with @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is identical to the scaling found in the original jammed sphere packings , where @xmath26 is lowered by decompressing the system . in decompressing a jammed packing </S>",
    "<S> , this suggests that the contacts most likely to disappear are those which contribute minimally to the bulk modulus , providing theoretical insight into why jamming has anomalous @xmath0 behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> we can drive the same initial network to the opposite limit , @xmath34 , by successively removing bonds with the _ largest _ contribution to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> as before , independence of bond - level response predicts that the shear modulus will again decrease linearly with @xmath26 , as we indeed find ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bond_level_independence]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the bulk modulus will decrease more quickly , as prescribed by the high @xmath8 tail of the distribution , suggesting that the ratio @xmath0 should _ increase_. the result of this successive bond - removal algorithm is shown by the blue squares in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : global_response ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the increase in @xmath0 occurs with a _ much _ steeper power law than the decrease of @xmath0 when the bond with the smallest contribution to @xmath14 is removed . </S>",
    "<S> this power law implies that the distribution @xmath37 evolves as bond pruning proceeds .    </S>",
    "<S> the algorithms mentioned above can be extended in a number of ways . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one can remove the bond with the largest contribution to the shear modulus to drive @xmath0 towards zero . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , independence of bond - level response implies that the bulk modulus would respond as if bonds were removed randomly , so that @xmath38 ( see fig .  [ fig : bond_level_independence]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the shear modulus decreases more rapidly ; we find @xmath39 , where @xmath40 ( purple diamonds in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : global_response ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we can also tune two - dimensional networks with equal ease . </S>",
    "<S> we construct spring networks in two dimensions with approximately 8000 nodes and an initial coordination number of @xmath41 , which is about 1% above the minimum needed for rigidity . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : global_response_2d ] shows @xmath0 as bonds are pruned towards @xmath31 for the same four selected - bond removal algorithms as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : global_response ] . </S>",
    "<S> when bonds with the smallest @xmath8 are removed , we find that @xmath32 with @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this is close to the behavior known for jammed packings ( @xmath43 ) , though it is certainly not as clean as in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> when we prune bonds that resist compression the most ( largest @xmath8 ) , we find that @xmath44 , where @xmath45 . at the smallest @xmath26 , @xmath46 . finally , when bonds with the largest @xmath12 are removed we find that @xmath47 , with @xmath48.although @xmath0 diverges / vanishes with slightly different power laws in two dimensions , the overall effect is no less drastic .    note that our procedures are remarkably efficient in tuning @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> figures  [ fig : global_response ] and [ fig : global_response_2d ] show that by removing less than 2% of the bonds in three - dimensional networks we can obtain a difference of more than 16 orders of magnitude in the tuned value of @xmath0 , depending on which bonds we prune . in two dimensions , pruning is similarly efficient ; starting with the same initial configuration we are able to obtain differences in @xmath0 that span over 17 orders of magnitude by pruning only @xmath49 of the bonds.we also note that our bond - cutting procedures do not create any zero - frequency vibrational modes in the system , which would herald an instability in the structure . </S>",
    "<S> the limit @xmath30 corresponds to the incompressible limit of a solid where the poisson ratio , @xmath50 $ ] in @xmath7 dimensions , reaches its maximum value of @xmath51 ( in @xmath52 ) or @xmath53 ( in @xmath19 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the limit @xmath34 corresponds to the auxetic limit where the poisson ratio reaches its minimum value of @xmath54 . by using these different pruning algorithms </S>",
    "<S> , we can tailor networks to have any poisson ratio between these two limits . </S>",
    "<S> this ability provides great flexibility in the design of network materials .    </S>",
    "<S> we turn now to spatial correlations between cut bonds . </S>",
    "<S> driscoll _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have conducted numerical simulations in which they removed bonds with the _ largest _ strain under uniaxial or isotropic compression or shear . </S>",
    "<S> they showed that the cut bonds form a damage zone whose width increases and diverges as the initial excess coordination number , @xmath55 ; for sufficiently small @xmath56 , the pruned bonds are homogeneously distributed throughout the entire system . </S>",
    "<S> outside this zone , they found that the network is essentially unaffected .    when pruning bonds with the _ largest _ contribution to @xmath14 or @xmath15 , all the data presented thus far are for systems with a sufficiently small @xmath56 so that the distribution of the cut bonds appears homogeneous . in our simulations with large @xmath56 , where the damage zone is smaller than the size of our system , we find that @xmath0 still diverges / vanishes , but does so when @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> when we remove the bond with the _ smallest _ contribution to @xmath14 or @xmath15 , the bonds are initially removed homogeneously throughout the system , independent of @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of tunable strong spatial correlations in the cut bonds , as found by driscoll _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , allows one to create textured materials spatially varying mechanical properties . </S>",
    "<S> one region may be highly incompressible while a nearby region may be highly auxetic . </S>",
    "<S> this offers a great variety in the mechanical response of these networks .    for many materials  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the poisson ratio decreases with increased connectivity of the constituent particles and increases with packing density . </S>",
    "<S> we note that neither of these correlations hold for the algorithms we have introduced for tuning the poisson ratio ( or ratio of shear and bulk moduli ) </S>",
    "<S> . we can reach @xmath34 ( minimum poisson ratio ) or @xmath30 ( maximum poisson ratio ) by removing the same number of bonds from the same starting configuration . neither the overall connectivity nor the overall density is different in the two final states . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our procedures for producing tunable poisson ratio materials are fundamentally different from correlations considered in the literature .    </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a number of ways of tuning @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that these ideas may be extended to other global properties ( _ e.g. _ , thermal expansion or electrical response  @xcite ) where the response can be written in terms of sums over bond contributions . as long as there is independence of bond - level response </S>",
    "<S> , one should be able to tune the ratio of global properties by using the same protocol of removing bonds that are especially susceptible ( or especially unsusceptible ) to a given global perturbation .    </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that disordered networks provide particularly elegant opportunities for constructing mechanical metamaterials with tunable , flexible and spatially textured response . </S>",
    "<S> however , the algorithms we have presented may not be restricted to artificially constructed materials . </S>",
    "<S> for example , compressing a network composed of springs that fail when stressed past a given threshold would result in the same network as removing springs with the largest @xmath8 , provided that the threshold is sufficiently small . </S>",
    "<S> it is also not beyond imagination that one could selectively break bonds at the nano - scale level in response to global perturbations in complex solids . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , biology appears to be able to target structures in networks that are under particularly high stress and to enhance their strength ( such as in trabecular bone  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , there may be mechanisms to buckle or sever strongly stressed fibers ( such as in actin networks  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to ask if such selective repair or destruction of biological structures changes ratios of different mechanical responses such as the poisson ratio . </S>"
