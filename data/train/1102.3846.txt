    "since the introduction of measure - theoretical entropy for an invariant measure @xcite and topological entropy @xcite , the relationship between these two kinds of entropy has gained a lot of attention . by the work of goodwyn @xcite and goodman @xcite , the classical variational principle was completed , namely , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a homeomorphism from a compact metric space @xmath5 to itself , and the supremum is taken over all invariant measures . a short proof for it was given by misiurewicz @xcite . for a factor map between two dynamical systems @xmath6 and @xmath7 the notions of relative topological entropy @xmath8 and relative measure - theoretical entropy @xmath9 for an invariant measure were also introduced @xcite .",
