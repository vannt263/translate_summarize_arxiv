    "the dynamics of antiproton - nucleus collisions is a complex process , which is associated with the mean - field potentials of antinucleons and produced particles in nuclear medium , and also with a number of reaction channels , i.e. , the annihilation channels , charge - exchange reaction , elastic and inelastic collisions .",
    "a more localized energy deposition is able to be produced in antiproton - nucleus collisions in comparison with heavy - ion collisions due to the annihilations .",
    "searching for the cold quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) with antiproton beams has been performed as a hot topic both in experiments and in theory calculations over the past several decades .",
    "the large yields of strange particles may be produced in antiproton induced reactions , which have the advantage in comparison to proton - nucleus and heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the particle production in collisions of antiproton on nuclei has been investigated by using the intranuclear cascade ( inc ) model and a number of experimental data was nicely explained @xcite .",
    "self - consistent description of dynamical evolutions and collisions of antiproton on nucleus with transport models is still very necessary , in particular the fragmentation in collisions of antiproton on nucleus to form hypernuclei .",
    "strangeness production and formation of hypernuclei in antiproton induced nuclear reactions has been investigated throughly with the giessen boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( gibuu ) transport model @xcite .",
    "the production of hypernuclei is associated with the reaction channels of hyperons and also hyperon - nucleon ( hn ) potential . from comparison of kinetic energy or momentum spectra of hyperons to experimental data , the hn potential can be extracted .",
    "also the antinucleon - nucleon potential is able to be constrained from particle production .",
    "the dynamical mechanism on strange particle production can be explored from the analysis of reaction channels and comparison to experimental spectra .",
    "in the lanzhou quantum molecular dynamics ( lqmd ) model , the dynamics of resonances ( @xmath9(1232 ) , n*(1440 ) , n*(1535 ) etc ) , hyperons ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) and mesons ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) is described via hadron - hadron collisions , decays of resonances and mean - field potentials in nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "the evolutions of baryons ( nucleons , resonances and hyperons ) , anti - baryons and mesons in the collisions are governed by hamilton s equations of motion .",
    "a skyrme - type interaction has been used in the evaluation of potential energy for nucleons and resonances .",
    "the hyperon mean - field potential is constructed on the basis of the light - quark counting rule .",
    "the self - energies of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are assumed to be two thirds of that experienced by nucleons . and the @xmath12 self - energy is one third of nucleon s ones .",
    "thus , the in - medium dispersion relation reads @xmath19 e.g. , for hyperons @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "the strengths of repulsive kaon - nucleon ( kn ) potential and of attractive antikaon - nucleon potential with the values of 27.8 mev and -100.3 mev are obtained at saturation baryon density for isospin symmetric matter , respectively .",
    "the in - medium potentials of kaons and antikaons are of importance on dynamical emissions in phase space from the knowledge of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we did not include the optical potentials for other mesons .",

    "the probability reaching a channel in a collision is calculated by its contribution of the channel cross section to the total cross section as @xmath55 .",

    "the experimental data from lear ( low - energy antiproton ring ) measurements at cern @xcite can be nicely reproduced with the model over the whole momentum range .",
    "the attractive @xmath39n potential in nuclear medium slightly enhances the collision probabilities between antinucleons and nucleons , which leads to the increase of the momentum spectra .",
    "the shape of the proton spectra is determined by elastic collisions of antiproton on nucleons . at the considered energy ,",
    "pions are mainly produced from the annihilation of @xmath39n .",
    "the decay channel from @xmath56 formed in collisions of @xmath0 on nucleons has nonnegligible contribution on the low - momentum @xmath13 production .",
    "the system size dependence of particle production in antiproton induced reactions can be observed from the transverse momentum as shown in fig .",
    "it is obvious that the yields increase with the atomic mass of target nucleus because of the reaction cross section .",
    "the distribution trends are basically the same from lighter to heavier target .            the phase - space structure of particle emission in antiproton",

    "experimental data from lear measurements @xcite are well reproduced over the whole rapidity range .",
    "one notices that the proton emission in antiproton induced reactions almost exhibits a symmetric distribution .",
    "however , pions and kaons are produced towards the centre of mass ( c.m . )",
    "rapidity of antiproton and nucleon ( 0.31 ) .",
    "influence of the @xmath0n potential on particle emissions is nearly negligible besides the mid - rapidity production .",
    "incident momentum dependence of rapidity distribution for neutral particles in the reaction of @xmath0+@xmath1c is shown in fig .",
    "the peaks of @xmath57 and k@xmath48 move towards the c.m .",
    "rapidity of @xmath0 on nucleon ( y@xmath58=0.11 , 0.31 , 0.46 and 1.08 at the incident momenta of 200 mev / c , 608 mev / c , 1 gev / c and 4 gev / c , respectively ) with increasing the incident momentum .",
    "the symmetric structure appears for the neutral hyperons and the forward emission is dominant at 4 gev / c .",
    "the results are caused from the fact that the pions and kaons are mainly produced from the annihilation of @xmath0 on nucleons .",
    "the strangeness exchange reactions @xmath59 contribute the hyperon production at incident momentum below the threshold value , e.g. , the reaction @xmath60 ( p@xmath61=1.439 gev / c ) .",
    "the hyperon is also produced via meson induced reactions @xmath62 with m being @xmath63 .",
    "more information of particle production in antiproton induced reactions can be obtained from the invariant spectra . shown in fig .",
    "6 is the kinetic energy spectra of inclusive invariant cross sections for the production of @xmath8 , k@xmath49 , k@xmath51 and neutral hyperons in collisions of @xmath0 on @xmath1c at incident momenta of 50 mev / c , 200 mev / c , 608 mev / c , 1 gev / c and 4 gev / c , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that the spectra become more and more flat with increasing the incident momentum , in particular for neutral hyperons at above the threshold momentum .",
    "dependence of the spectra on reaction system is also investigated for neutral particles at the incident momentum of 4 gev / c in fig .",
    "it is obvious the production yields is increasing with heavier target because of the larger geometric cross sections .",
    "the invariant cross section can be fitted by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution as @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the total energy and the kinetic energy , respectively , and the normalization @xmath67 and temperature @xmath68 being the fitting parameters .",
    "the inverse slope parameters @xmath68 have been obtained for @xmath57 being the values of 103@xmath694 mev , 106@xmath693 mev and 110@xmath692 mev for @xmath1c , @xmath3ca and @xmath5ta , respectively .",

    "the results are basically consistent with the experimental data by kek in @xmath0+@xmath5ta reaction at incident momentum of 4 gev / c @xcite , where the temperatures of 135@xmath6913 mev and 97@xmath696 mev were obtained for k@xmath71 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the conclusions are also useful for the future panda experiments .",
    "the lower temperature parameters are obtained for pions , antikaons and hyperons in comparison to the ones of kaons , which are caused from the secondary collisions , e.g. , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .        to avoid the geometric effects on particle production in",
    "antiproton induced reactions , the multiplicities of pions , kaons , antikaons and hyperons are calculated from the carbon to uranium in fig .",
    "it is obvious that a flat structure appears in the production of pions and kaons .",
    "the number of antikaons decreases with the atomic mass of target nuclide .",
    "however , the hyperon production gives an opposite trend because of the strangeness exchange reactions .",
    "we have included the hyperon - nucleon potential in the calculation .",
    "it would be a nice approach with medium or heavy target to produce hypernucleus in the antiproton induced reactions .",
    "the work on hypernucleus production in the antiproton induced reactions with the lqmd transport model combined with the statistical model is in progress .",
    "the lqmd model has been further improved to investigate the nuclear dynamics induced by antiprotons .",
    "dynamics on particle production , in particular pions , kaons , antikaons and hyperons , has been investigated within the model .",
    "the @xmath39n potential slightly changes the structures of rapidity and momentum distributions of @xmath8 and protons in comparison to the lear data .",
    "the yields of pions , kaons and antikaons are mainly contributed from the annihilations of antiproton on nucleons .",
    "hyperons are dominated via the meson - nucleon collisions and strangeness exchange reactions when the incident momentum is below the annihilation threshold value .",
    "the obtained nuclear temperature is still below the condition of qgp formation .",
    "the hyperon - nucleon potential has been shown to be importance of hyperon emissions in phase space in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of hyperons captured by fragments to form hypernuclei will be helpful for measurements in experiments .",
