    "quantum entanglement , a kind of nonclassical correlation in quantum world , is a fundamental concept of quantum mechanics @xcite . it is well accepted that entanglement plays a crucial role and is the invaluable resource in quantum computation and quantum information @xcite . recently , it is realized that entanglement is not the only aspect of quantum correlations , and the nonclassical correlations other than entanglement may also play fundamental roles in quantum information processing @xcite . among several measures of quantum correlations ,",
    "the so called quantum discord , introduced by olliver and zurek @xcite and also by henderson and vedral @xcite , has been receiving a great deal of attentions @xcite .    quantum discord , as an important supplementary to quantum entanglement ,",
    "is found to be present in the deterministic quantum computation with one qubit ( dqc1 ) while the entanglement is vanishing @xcite . on the other hand , quantum discord is similar as entanglement , for example , it can be considered as a resource in some quantum information processing protocols @xcite .",
    "quantum discord can also be related directly with quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "one fundamental point is perhaps that quantum discord coincides quantum entanglement for pure state . however , besides different roles in dqc1 , there are some other fundamental points which are different for quantum discord and quantum entanglement .",
    "one of the key differences is that quantum entanglement is non - increasing under the local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , while quantum discord can increase under a local quantum channel acting on a single side of the studied bipartite state @xcite .",
    "this is surprising since it is generally believed that quantum correlations can only decrease generally under local quantum operations even classical communication is allowed . here",
    "let us note that various quantum correlations , including quantum discord and quantum entanglement , are invariant under local unitary operations by definition .    to be more explicit , entanglement can increase only when coherent operations are applied .",
    "this is similar as in classical case , we know that classical correlation can increase when classical communication is allowed , which apparently involves two parties . in comparison , quantum discord which describes the quantumness of correlations , can increase under one - side local quantum operations . in this paper , we will add more evidences to show that quantum discord may possess some properties under a single local quantum channel .",
    "we know that contrary to the entanglement sudden death ( esd ) @xcite , the behaviors of quantum discord under the markovian environments decays exponentially and disappears asymptotically@xcite .",
    "but the investigation recently shows that the decay rates of quantum correlation may have sudden changes @xcite under composite noises .",
    "we already find some evidences showing that one side quantum channel is already enough for the occurrence of some phenomena for quantum discord , one may wonder whether the discord sudden change can occur when only one qubit of quantum system is subjected to a noisy environment while leaving the other subsystem free of noise ?",
    "in this article , we investigate the dynamics of quantum discord of two qubit x shape state with only one particle exposed to noise .",
    "our results show that composite noises are not necessary for the sudden change of quantum correlation , a single side of quantum channel is enough .",
    "it is widely accepted that the total correlation of a bipartite system  @xmath0 is measured by the quantum mutual information defined as @xmath1 where  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 are the reduced density matrices of  @xmath0 , and  @xmath4 is the von neumann entropy .",

    "( [ eq : rho ] ) are given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and then the quantum discord of state  @xmath14 is given as @xmath20    a generalization of quantum discord from bell - diagonal states to a class of x shape state is given in ref .",
    "@xcite recently with state in form , @xmath21 where @xmath22 , one can find that  @xmath23 reduces to  @xmath14 when  @xmath24 .",
    "the mutual information and classical correlation of state  @xmath23 are given by @xmath25 here  @xmath26 are shown in @xcite , and  @xmath27 is defined as  @xmath28 .",
    "then quantum discord , the quantum correlation of state  @xmath23 , is given by @xmath29    it is difficult to calculate quantum discord in general case since the optimization should be taken . however , the analytical expression of quantum discord about bell - diagonal states is available @xcite which provides a convenient method in studying the dynamics of quantum correlation in case the studied states satisfy this special form @xcite . in this paper , based on an analytical expression of quantum correlation which generalize the discord from bell - diagonal states to a class of x shape states",
    "@xcite , we can investigate dynamics of quantum discord with more kinds of quantum noises .",
    "in particular , the analytical discord can be found for cases with one side quantum channel . as a result",
    ", we can study three different kinds of quantum channels , amplitude , dephasing , and depolarizing which act on the first qubit of a class of two - qubit x states .",
