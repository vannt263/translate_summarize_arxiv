    "<S> we present a novel method to image spin properties of spintronic systems using the spatially confined field of a scanned micromagnetic probe , in conjunction with existing electrical or optical _ global _ spin detection schemes . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus applicable to all materials systems susceptible to either of those approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed technique relies on numerical solutions to the spin diffusion equation in the presence of spatially varying fields to obtain the local spin response to the micromagnetic probe field . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions also provide insight into the effects of inhomogeneities on hanle measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> spin electronics is a rich and rapidly growing field that integrates magnetic and nonmagnetic materials to enable a variety of spin polarized transport phenomena @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> several recent results have brought us closer to electrically - controlled room - temperature spintronic devices @xcite . however , much is still not well understood , particularly regarding the mechanisms that degrade spin polarization , in the often complex magnetic environment that prevails in spintronic devices . </S>",
    "<S> spin lifetimes inferred from measurements are often much shorter than theoretical expectations and the influence of impurities , inhomogeneities and other departures from ideal structures remain poorly understood </S>",
    "<S> .    a technique which could spatially resolve the local variations of spin density and other key parameters , such as spin lifetime , in multicomponent spintronic devices would have enormous impact . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that local information about the spin properties can be encoded in the variation of the global spin polarization in response to a spatially scanned magnetic field from a micromagnetic probe . in analogy with electrostatic tip - induced scattering in a two - dimensional electron gas @xcite the local magnetization </S>",
    "<S> is modified to an extent determined by both the vector field of the micromagnetic probe and the local spin properties . </S>",
    "<S> this local perturbation is detected by established global spin polarization measurement techniques ( such as spin photoluminescence or non - local voltage ) which , in themselves , need not provide spatially resolved information , hence the method is applicable to any materials system ( whether optically active or inactive ) . </S>",
    "<S> a schematic of our proposed imaging technique is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tau_s imaging](a ) . as a magnetic dipole </S>",
    "<S> is scanned above the sample the dependence of a globally detected spin signal on position of the probe provides a map of the sample s spin properties .    </S>",
    "<S> spin dynamics in nonmagnetic materials are given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the spin density , @xmath2 is the spin diffusion constant , @xmath3 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath4 is the total magnetic field experienced by the spins , @xmath5 is the spin relaxation time , and @xmath6 represents the spin generation term , e.g. irradiation with circularly polarized light . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 is a function of time @xmath7 and spatial position @xmath8 for the 2d sample that we consider .    </S>",
    "<S> the spatially dependent response of the spin polarization to the magnetic field of the probe tip can be calculated by means of a numerical technique we have developed for solving the spin diffusion equation in the presence of spatially varying vector magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> vector precession is an added complexity which is not present in the case of ( scalar ) charge deflection by a scanned gate . </S>",
    "<S> our technique gives steady state spatial maps of spin density as a function of the location of the micromagnetic probe over the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical solution is obtained from the time - dependent form of the diffusion equation using euler s iterative method ( please see supplementary material for further details ) . though we do not consider electric fields nor take @xmath4 , @xmath9 and @xmath5 to be time - dependent these situations </S>",
    "<S> are straightforwardly handled by our approach .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider spins injected uniformly into the sample by some means ( uniformity is not a necessary condition ) . </S>",
    "<S> the injected spins and the scanned dipole are assumed to be oriented along @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this sample has a small localized region in which the spin lifetime is five times longer than the rest of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> panels ( b ) and ( c ) of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tau_s imaging ] show spatial maps of @xmath11 , the component of the spin density parallel to the injected spin direction , for two positions of the probe relative to the lifetime inhomogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> panel ( d ) presents the image of @xmath12 , the integral of @xmath11 over the entire sample , as a function of the position of dipole over the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the region of slower relaxation rate is clearly distinguished from the rest of the sample .    the sensitivity of spin polarization to the position of the probe arises from the interrelationship of the two mechanisms that alter spin polarization : spin relaxation and dephasing of spins in an ensemble as they precess about the spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field vectors . </S>",
    "<S> fields parallel and perpendicular have contrasting impacts since magnetic field parallel to the injected spin direction will tend to maintain this orientation and maximize spin polarization , while transverse components cause precession , thus dephasing and a reduction of spin polarization . </S>",
    "<S> this competition between the various components of the magnetic field is well captured by a quantity @xmath13 , which governs the average projection of the spins along the @xmath14-axis ( e.g. , for uniform systems , the steady - state value of @xmath15 is proportional to @xmath16 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in spatially varying fields arising from a micromagnetic tip . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole field arising from a magnetic moment @xmath17 located at ( 0 , 0 , @xmath18 ) over a sample in the @xmath19-plane results in a spatial variation of spin density @xmath11 shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : thetabsz ] ( left axis ) along with @xmath20 ( right axis ) . </S>",
    "<S> here we assume a sample with uniform @xmath5 and uniform injection of spins oriented parallel to @xmath21 and approximate the probe field by @xmath22/r^{5}$ ] , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the permeability of free space . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : thetabsz ] shows @xmath11 both with and without diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the anticorrelation between @xmath11 and @xmath20 is particularly evident when diffusion is neglected because a given spin experiences a single magnetic field throughout its lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> diffusion smears out the sharp features , and if the minima in @xmath25 ( for @xmath26 ) occur closer than a spin - diffusion length @xmath27 away from the central peak , then the peak will collapse leaving a localized volume of suppressed spin density .    </S>",
    "<S> this local suppression of the spin polarization by the probe tip field provides the basis for scanned probe imaging of a spintronic sample : the impact of this tip field is determined by local sample properties . </S>",
    "<S> the image contrast in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tau_s imaging](d ) results from the fact that long - lived spins are more strongly dephased because they experience the tip field for a longer time before being replaced by fresh , well - oriented spins . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the globally averaged spin density of the sample will be more strongly suppressed when the dipole is over the region of longer @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the size of this effect depends on the `` global '' size over which the spin polarization is integrated .    to estimate the spatial resolution of our imaging technique , we consider the effect of a linear magnetic field gradient : @xmath28 ( see fig . [ fig : linear field gradient ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the injected spins are uniformly oriented along @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting variation of @xmath25 along the @xmath29-axis , for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the half - width of the conventional lorentzian hanle curve @xcite , is presented in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : linear field gradient ] . </S>",
    "<S> a hanle curve is simply a plot of the dependence of spin polarization on a transverse magnetic field . in the absence of diffusion , spins at different positions along the @xmath29-axis will sample different fields , resulting in a mapping of the conventional hanle curve onto the spatial domain . </S>",
    "<S> thus , spins will exist primarily in the region where @xmath32 , i.e. , where @xmath33 . the location of the surviving spin magnetization can be spatially shifted by adding a uniform offset to the gradient field .    </S>",
    "<S> a measure of the resolution may be obtained from the width of a gaussian fit , @xmath34 , to this curve . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : linear field gradient ] shows this width as a function of the applied gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial resolution @xmath34 decreases in inverse proportion to the gradient until @xmath35 below which its rate of decreases slows . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is reminiscent of magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) where spatial information is encoded into field or frequency shifts through magnetic field gradients @xcite . as in mri </S>",
    "<S> , diffusion degrades resolution , though in the current approach it can be finer than the spin diffusion length if one uses strong enough gradients , as seen in numerical simulations shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : linear field gradient ] . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it should be noted that diffusion lengths for many spintronic systems are of the order of a micron , especially at room temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> field gradients exceeding 10 g / nm are achievable with rare - earth micromagnetic tips @xcite such as are used in magnetic force resonance microscopy @xcite indicating that high spatial resolution is possible with this technique . in the case of imaging with a dipole tip , the gradients ( and the regions of suppressed magnetization shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : thetabsz ] ) can not be smaller than the probe - sample separation , @xmath18 , so for large @xmath18 this will set the resolution .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding the impact of microscopic inhomogeneities on spin transport is a centrally important issue that calls for spatially resolved studies . </S>",
    "<S> particularly important are inhomogeneities due to the stray fields arising from imperfect ferromagnetic injectors used for electrical injection @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spin lifetime is typically obtained from the width of hanle curves , but such global measures of spin polarization are sensitive to inhomogeneities , so microscopic approaches are needed to discern the various mechanisms that can affect the shape of a hanle curve .    </S>",
    "<S> non - uniformity of the interface and complex domain structures can cause the injected spin population to experience significantly different magnetic fields , and lose spin - information on time scales much shorter than spin lifetime due to dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical method is capable of simulating the impact of magnetic fields with random spatial variation . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : random field ] shows calculated hanle curves in the presence of random magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a field @xmath36 where we sample normal distributions of mean zero and variance @xmath37 for each field component at every spatial point . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : random field ] shows results for three values of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the maxima can be shifted and , as in the last case , the curves can be significantly broadened .    </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to consider , in turn , the effects of each magnetic field component on the hanle curve , as is done in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : uniform field ] . for an applied hanle field @xmath39 , </S>",
    "<S> the half - width at half - maximum @xmath40 of a hanle curve in the presence of an additional uniform field @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> a transverse field @xmath43 reduces @xmath44 ( blue curve ) and @xmath45 is required to significantly reduce @xmath46 further . a non - zero @xmath47 ( red curve ) on the other hand will not reduce @xmath44 but will broaden the hanle curve , since @xmath48 is required to significantly increase the spin precession cone angle . </S>",
    "<S> a field @xmath49 ( parallel to @xmath50 ) shifts the peak of the hanle curve , since @xmath46 is maximized when the _ total _ transverse field is zero ( black curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results of fig . [ fig : random field ] can be considered a superposition of the shifting and broadening seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : uniform field ] . </S>",
    "<S> clearly these effects can confound the determination of spin lifetimes from hanle widths . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed features of the stray field generated by a rough ferromagnetic injector will depend on several characteristics including roughness , saturation magnetization , domain size , and thickness . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of these details , stray fields of the order kilogauss are readily achievable a few nanometers away from a rough injector and these can substantially affect the spin polarization . </S>",
    "<S> in fact this has been experimentally observed in silicon devices @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed a new technique for imaging spin properties of spatially inhomogeneous samples that achieves applicability to a wide variety of materials by relying on proven spin polarization detection techniques such as electrical and optical detection . </S>",
    "<S> the localized information is obtained by detecting the modification to the local spin density by the confined magnetic field of a magnetic dipole scanned over the sample . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we have developed a method for simulating spin density in a medium with spatial or temporal inhomogeneities of the magnetic field , lifetime , or diffusion constant , regardless of injection or detection technique . </S>",
    "<S> as in mri , this technique has a spatial resolution inversely proportional to the gradient of the magnetic field down to length scales comparable to the spin diffusion length . </S>",
    "<S> below this , resolution improves more slowly with increasing gradient . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical analysis of spin transport emphasizes the importance of experimental characterization of microscopic inhomogeneity , and of models that incorporate these phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , inhomogeneities can confound the interpretation of spin polarization and lifetime measurements , as in hanle curves . </S>",
    "<S> microscopic imaging of spin properties of real - world devices will be essential for improving their spin fidelity and functionality .    </S>",
