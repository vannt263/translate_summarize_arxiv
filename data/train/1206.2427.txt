    "this feature is in contrast to the trend known in single non - interacting networks where networks with broader degree distribution are more robust . in real world , however , not all nodes in one network depend on all nodes in the other network , so it is of interest to study the robustness of two partially interdependent scale - free networks .",

    "<S> we study the percolation behavior of two interdependent scale - free ( sf ) networks under random failure of 1-@xmath0 fraction of nodes . </S>",
    "<S> our results are based on numerical solutions of analytical expressions and simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that as the coupling strength between the two networks @xmath1 reduces from @xmath2 ( fully coupled ) to @xmath3 ( no coupling ) , there exist two critical coupling strengths @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which separate three different regions with different behavior of the giant component as a function of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) for @xmath6 , an abrupt collapse transition occurs at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) for @xmath8 , the giant component has a hybrid transition combined of both , abrupt decrease at a certain @xmath9 followed by a smooth decrease to zero for @xmath10 as @xmath0 decreases to zero . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) for @xmath11 , the giant component has a continuous second - order transition ( at @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath12 for @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; and for @xmath15 , @xmath4 decreases with increasing @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 in the hybrid transition , at the @xmath18 region , the mutual giant component @xmath19 jumps discontinuously at @xmath9 to a very small but non - zero value , and when reducing @xmath0 , @xmath19 continuously approaches to @xmath3 at @xmath20 for @xmath21 and at @xmath22 for @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the known theoretical @xmath23 for a single network with @xmath24 is expected to be valid also for strictly partial interdependent networks . </S>"
