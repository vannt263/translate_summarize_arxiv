    "in the hierarchical structure formation model , massive early - type galaxies are believed to be formed via galaxy mergers ( e.g. , toomre & toomre 1972 ; schweizer 1982 ; barnes 1988 ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ) .",
    "the most favored core - srsic galaxy formation scenario predicts the creation of their partially depleted cores by the action of coalescing supermassive black hole ( smbh ) binaries within the merged remnant of their gas - poor progenitors .",
    "the energy which is transferred from the smbh binary s orbital decay causes the slingshot ejection of the inner stars , creating the stellar light deficits of core - srsic galaxies ( e.g. , begelman et al .",
    "1980 ; ebisuzaki et al .  1991",
    "; milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ; merritt 2006 ) .",
    "this three - body scattering process preferentially removes stars on radial ( eccentric ) orbits , resulting in tangentially biased ( circular ) orbits in the core region of core - srsic galaxies , and excess levels of radial orbits beyond the core ( e.g. , quinlan & hernquist 1997 ; milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "thomas et al .",
    "( 2014 ) have recently found these kinematical signatures in six core - srsic galaxies .",
    "it , therefore , seems reasonable that the inner isophotal shape , orientation ( position angle ) and radial light distribution of a core - srsic galaxy may be connected to each other and to the details of the physical processes that built the galaxy at large .",
    "for instance , does the orientation of the core still reflect the orbital plane of the merging smbhs , and does that also reflect the orbital alignment of the pre - merged galaxies and the final outer / global isophotal shape of the wedded galaxy pair ?",
    "such questions are the main motivation for this work .",
    " core - srsic \" galaxies have central light deficits relative to the ( steeper ) inward extrapolation of their spheroids ( i.e. , elliptical galaxies or bulges ) outer srsic profile ( graham et al .",
    "2003 ) , while  core \" galaxies with an inner slope @xmath8 ( lauer et al .",
    "1995 ) do not necessarily have deficits relative to the outer srsic profile .",
    "the nuker model break radii are typically @xmath9 times larger than the core - srsic model break radii ( e.g. , trujillo et al .",
    "2004 ) ; i.e. , they are somewhat outside of the main depleted core and therefore not an ideal location to measure the core s ellipticity and position angle .",
    "however , the smaller radius where the negative , logarithmic slope of the projected light profile equals 0.5 can be derived from the nuker model parameters ( carollo et al .",
    "1997 ; rest et al .",
    "2001 ) and matches very well with the core - srsic break radius ( dullo & graham 2012 ) .",
    "however , dullo & graham ( 2012 ) found that @xmath1018% of  cores \" according to the nuker model are not depleted cores according to the core - srsic model and as such , application of the core - srsic model is still required if one wishes to identify galaxies with partially depleted cores rather than simply flattish inner ( non - depleted ) srsic light profiles .",
    "graham ( 2004 ) asked whether the ellipticity ( and position angle ) at the break radii of actual partially depleted cores in core - srsic galaxies agrees and aligns with the outer spheroids ellipticity ( and position angle ) . with a sufficiently large ( n=24 ) sample we can now start to probe this question .    previous works on the evolution of triaxial galaxies had indicated that a central supermassive black hole would destroy the inner box orbits leaving a rounder or nearly spherical core ( e.g. , norman , may , & van albada 1985 ; gerhard & binney 1985 ; merritt & quinlan 1998 ; merritt 2000 ; holley - bockelmann et al .  2002 ; merritt & poon 2004 ) , while the outer parts of core - srsic spheroids are thought to be built , shaped and oriented by dissipationless , major galaxy merging and the ensuing strong violent relaxation and phase mixing ( e.g. , van albada 1982 ; mcglynn 1984 ; burkert et al .",
    "2008 ; hopkins et al .  2009 ) .",
    "in addition , the change in the shapes and orientations of the isophotes at large radii may arise from the effect of tidal encounters with nearby massive companions ( nieto & bender 1989 ; hao et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the presence of isophotal twisting in galaxies are also commonly associated with triaxiality , bars , disks or dust lanes ( e.g. , nieto et al .  1992 ) . in this paper , we investigate the radial changes of the shapes and orientations of core - srsic galaxies , and the implications for their formation and evolution .",
    "we note that core - srsic galaxies are not confined to elliptical galaxies .",
    "lenticular disc galaxies , i.e. ,  fast rotators \" , are also known to contain partially - depleted cores relative to their bulge s main srsic profile ( dullo & graham 2013 ; krajnovi et al .  2013 ) .",
    "while these discs may be associated with the galaxy s previous merger event ( e.g. , naab & burkert 2003 ) , they may have been subsequently accreted from cold gas flows , possibly fed along streams of a fixed orientation ( pichon et al .",
    "2011 ) . in what follows we use the shapes of the bulge , or bulge - dominated , region of the galaxies .",
    "in section  [ secv2 ] we describe our data selection , and isophotal profile extraction techniques .",
    "the measurements of the inner and outer ellipticities and orientations of the galaxies are presented in sections  [ secv3 ] and [ secv4 ] , respectively .",
    "section  [ secv5 ] discusses the implications of these results in the context of core - srsic galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "we also compare our study with previous works .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized in section  [ conv ] .",
    "we have used the iraf task ellipse ( jedrzejewski 1987 ) to extract ellipticity and position angle profiles from _ hst _ wfpc2 and acs images of a sample of 24 nearby ( @xmath1010 - 100 mpc ) core - srsic galaxies with @xmath11 mag presented in dullo & graham ( 2014 ) .",
    "these images were retrieved from the hubble legacy archive .",
    "all the 24 galaxies in our sample have partially depleted cores relative to their outer srsic profile ( see table  [ tabv1 ] ) .",
    "they have come from an initial sample of 39 galaxies ( lauer et al .",
    "2005 ) with shallow inner profile slopes , but not necessarily depleted cores ( see dullo & graham 2012 , 2013 ) .",
    "excluding seven srsic galaxies ( which do not have depleted cores ) and one dusty galaxy , in dullo & graham ( 2014 ) we studied 31 of these core - srsic galaxies . here , we excluded seven core - srsic galaxies from the dullo & graham ( 2014 ) sample .",

    "<S> the inner and outer shapes and orientations of core - srsic galaxies may hold important clues to their formation and evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore measured the central and outer ellipticities and position angles for a sample of 24 core - srsic galaxies using archival _ hst _ </S>",
    "<S> images and data . by selecting galaxies with core - srsic break radii @xmath0a measure of the size of their partially depleted core that are @xmath1.2 , we find that the ellipticities and position angles are quite robust against _ hst _ seeing . for the bulk of the galaxies </S>",
    "<S> , there is a good agreement between the ellipticities and position angles at the break radii and the average outer ellipticities and position angles determined over @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the spheroids effective half light radius . </S>",
    "<S> however there are some interesting differences . </S>",
    "<S> we find a median  inner \" ellipticity at @xmath0 of @xmath4= @xmath5 , rounder than the median ellipticity of the  outer \" regions @xmath4= @xmath6 , which is thought to reflect the influence of the central supermassive black hole at small radii . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for the first time we find a trend , albeit weak ( 2 @xmath7 significance ) , such that galaxies with larger ( stellar deficit)-to-(supermassive black hole ) mass ratios  thought to be a measure of the number of major dry merger events  tend to have rounder inner and outer isophotes , suggesting a connection between the galaxy shapes and their merger histories . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this finding is not simply reflecting the well known result that more luminous galaxies are rounder , but it is no doubt related . </S>"
