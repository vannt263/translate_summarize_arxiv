    "in recent years , single - molecule experiments employing optical tweezers , atomic force microscopy , and other techniques have successfully probed basic physical properties of biomolecules through the application of forces in the pn range ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "both , simple elastic properties of the polymers ( such as persistence length and longitudinal elasticity ) and structural transitions ( e.g. unfolding of protein domains ) were characterized by recording and analyzing force - extension curves ( fec s ) . for nucleic acids ,",
    "a prominent experiment of the latter type is the ` unzipping ' of double - stranded dna @xcite .",
    "the resulting fec s display clear sequence - specific features ( e.g. local maxima ) , which may be attributed to small regions of the sequence that are more strongly bound than their neighbors  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , long single - stranded dna , which , like rna , may fold into complicated branched structures by forming intra - strand basepairs , showed extremely smooth fec s in a very recent experiment by @xcite .",
    "thus , depending on its structure , dna may show a broad range of fec s from very rugged to completely featureless .",
    "however , it is unclear _ how _ quantitatively the structure determines the outcome of the fec measurement .    here , we address this question theoretically , focusing on the case of rna and restricting ourselves to secondary structure ( i.e. basepairing patterns only instead of full , tertiary structure ) . in this context",
    ", rna seems to be a more interesting object than dna , since rna naturally occurs in many different and functionally important structures , while dna is primarily found as a double strand .",
    "one may hope that pulling experiments generate new insights into the rna folding problem  @xcite , including the folding pathways  @xcite .",
    "also , force - induced denaturation of rna is currently studied experimentally ( c.  bustamante and i.  tinoco , private communiation ) .",
    "the limitation to secondary structure allows us to draw upon the experimentally determined ` free energy rules ' for rna secondary structure  @xcite , which yield minimum free energy structures that agree reasonably well with experimentally and phylogenetically determined ones  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it permits us to employ and extend the efficient dynamic programming algorithms  @xcite which can compute the exact partition function ( including all possible secondary structures ) and reconstruct the minimal free energy structures in polynomial time .",
    "experimentally , the secondary structures may be probed in specific ionic conditions ( e.g. , those with only monovalent ions ) such that the tertiary contacts are strongly disfavored ( due to electrostatic repulsion of the sugar - phosphate backbone )  @xcite .",
    ", while the force @xmath0 acting on the beads is measured .",
    "the open circles represent the open bases of the exterior single strands , modeled here as elastic freely jointed chains.,width=264 ]    the type of experiment that we consider is sketched in fig .",
    "[ figsketch ] .",
    "the distance @xmath1 between the two ends of an rna molecule is held fixed , e.g. , by attaching them to two beads whose positions are controlled by optical tweezers , and the force @xmath0 acting on the beads is recorded as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "as long as the external change in force / extension is applied at a much slower time scale than that of structural transitions of the molecule , the equilibrium fec is measured . in the main part of the present article",
    ", we assume that this is always the case .",
    "experimentally , this condition is usually checked by retracing the fec ( e.g. , a hysteresis effect is a clear sign of a non - equilibrium situation ) .    besides the above - mentioned free energy parameters for rna secondary structure , we need a polymer model for single - stranded rna as input in order to make quantitative predictions of fec s . to that end",
    ", we employ an elastic freely jointed chain model , which has been used to fit experimental fec s of single - stranded dna @xcite .",
    "this introduces two polymer parameters , the kuhn length characterizing the lateral rigidity , and the longitudinal elasticity , which is determined by the forces needed to stretch the chemical structure of the backbone .",
    "we estimate both from the experiments on dna , so that we are left with no free parameters .",
    "we find that for different secondary structures with all other parameters ( temperature , sequence length , etc . ) fixed , the fec s of rna vary over a broad range from very rugged to very smooth . apart from the entropic elasticity of the exterior single strand , which smoothens the features in the fec independent of the secondary structure as already discussed by @xcite",
    ", there are two additional smoothing mechanisms .",
    "the first is a ` compensation effect ' : the increase in the length of the exterior single strand upon opening of a structural element and the associated drop in the tension may be absorbed by rebinding of bases from the exterior single strand in other structural elements .",
    "the second is due to thermal fluctuations in the secondary structure , i.e. the contribution of suboptimal structures .",
    "we discuss both mechanisms and analyze the fluctuations in the fec quantitatively .",
    "the equilibrium fec s of typical ( natural or random ) rna sequences are smooth and display no distinguishable signatures of individual structural elements opening .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental result of @xcite for single - stranded dna , but applies even for sequences with only a few hundred nucleotides , i.e. for much shorter sequences than used in their experiment .    for the purpose of obtaining information on the structure of rna , the measurement of equilibrium fec s is therefore not very useful .",
    "more promising options include the measurement of the fluctuations about the equilibrium and non - equilibrium fec s , where the pulling proceeds faster than ( some of ) the rearrangements in the structure .",
    "while the present approach is extended readily to include equilibrium fluctuations ( gerland , u. , r. bundschuh , and t. hwa , in preparation ) , a quantitative treatment of the dynamics of force - induced denaturation of rna presents a challenge to theoreticians .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explain the details of our model and the way we calculate the fec s .",
    "readers interested in the results only should directly proceed to section iii .",
    "the discussion in section iv explores the possibility of using experimental fec s of appropriately designed sequences as an alternative way to determine the rna free energy parameters .",
    "in addition , we estimate to what extent features may be expected in non - equilibrium fec s .",
    "we assume that the force @xmath2 acting on the beads ( see fig .",
    "[ figsketch ] ) is measured as a function of the fixed distance @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the end - to - end vector of the rna molecule , and that @xmath1 is varied very slowly so that thermal equilibrium is always maintained . in practice",
    ", the force measurement requires a device acting as a spring , hence the distance can not be kept exactly constant . however , we consider the situation where the stiffness of this spring is much higher than that of the single - stranded rna , which has already been pulled out",
    ". this condition could only be violated in the very early part of the pulling experiment , which is not the focus of the present investigation .",
    "we may therefore neglect the presence of the spring altogether , which amounts to working in the ` fixed - distance ensemble ' .",
    "another difference between our model and actual experiments is that we neglect the presence of additional spacer sequences , which are used to connect the rna molecule to the force - measuring device ( e.g. the beads ) .",
    "again , we assume that they are stiffer than the liberated single - stranded rna , since we are interested in the size of the features in the fec , which are observable in an ideal measurement .",
    "the partition function at fixed extension , @xmath5 , for a given rna sequence consisting of @xmath6 nucleotides , may be written as a sum over the number @xmath7 of exterior open bases ( as represented by open circles in fig .",
    "[ figsketch ] ) . for each @xmath7 ,",
    "the secondary structure contributes a factor @xmath8 to the partition function , according to the free energy rules for rna / dna secondary structure to be detailed shortly below .",
    "this contribution needs to be weighted by the probability @xmath9 that the chain of @xmath7 exterior open bases has end - to - end vector @xmath4 , given by an appropriate polymer model for the single strand .",
    "together , they yield @xmath10 the normalization @xmath11 assures that the integral of @xmath5 over space yields the usual partition function @xmath12 for @xmath6 nucleotides without any external constraints .",
    "( [ convolution ] ) clearly separates the contribution of the secondary structure , which is entirely contained in @xmath8 , from the contribution of the exterior single strand contained in @xmath9 .",
    "note that the polymer properties of the _ interior _ single strands ( i.e. the single strands not subject to the external force ) are contained in @xmath8 through the loop - entropy parameters , which are part of the free energy rules derived from experiments ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "* secondary structure . *",
    "the number of possible secondary structures for a given sequence of length @xmath6 grows exponentially with @xmath6 . to each structure @xmath13",
    ", a boltzmann weight @xmath14 may be assigned with the help of the free energy rules  @xcite which contain a large number of experimentally determined energy and enthalpy parameters , e.g. , those for the stacking of basepairs , formation of internal , hairpin , bulge or multi - loops , and dangling ends . due to the large number of possible structures , the full partition function @xmath15 is impossible to evaluate by enumeration , except for very small @xmath6 .",
    "however , one can make use of recursion relations that express the partition function for a subsequence with the help of the partition functions for even shorter subsequences  @xcite , and proceed to compute the full partition function exactly in @xmath16 time . these recursion relations owe their existence to the fact that the class of secondary structures was defined to include only _ nested _ structures , e.g. two basepairs @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath19",
    "are not admitted ( the occurrence of such pairings is called a pseudoknot and contributes relatively little to the free energy of natural rnas  @xcite ) .",
    "one implementation of this algorithm with very detailed free energy rules is the ` vienna package ' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* publically available at http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/ ) . in the following ,",
    "we describe the modifications that we made to this package in order to obtain @xmath8 and the corresponding minimum free energy structures .",
    "the vienna package calculates the auxiliary partition function @xmath20 for the substrand ( i.e. , a contiguous segment of the sequence ) from base @xmath21 to base @xmath22 , under the condition that base @xmath21 and base @xmath22 are paired .",
    "these quantities can be used to calculate the partition function @xmath23 of the substrand from base @xmath24 to base @xmath22 , under the condition that the _ exterior _ part of the configurations is @xmath25 bases long .",

    "to produce the minimum free energy structures at fixed @xmath7 , we use an equivalent recursive scheme , but replacing the summations by maxima to obtain first the minimum free energy  @xcite .",

[ figgroup1]a and b show the fec s ( solid lines ) for two rna sequences with practically the same total length and composition , both computed as described in the last section using the same set of parameters . strikingly , the first curve is almost completely smooth with no significant features , while the second is extremely jagged with large ` jumps ' in the force .",
    "this dissemblance is entirely due to the difference between the secondary structures into which the two sequences fold .",
    "the sequence in fig .",
    "[ figgroup1]a originates from the group i intron of the methionine trna of _ scytonema hofmanii _ with a sequence length of @xmath60 ( genbank # u10481 ) .",

    "[ figgroup1]a . the sequence in fig .",
    "[ figgroup1]b was artificially generated by concatenating a randomly chosen sequence with its reverse complement , so that it folds into a single hairpin composed of random basepairs .",
    "its fec is very similar to the experimental force curve obtained upon unzipping double stranded dna by @xcite ; the sawtooth - like oscillations correspond to a ` molecular stick - slip process ' @xcite .",
    "why does the group i intron not display an abundance of features in the fec like the hairpin does ?",
    "its secondary structure consists of many structural elements ( e.g. stem - loop structures ) , the opening of which one might expect to produce clear signatures in the fec .",
    "indeed , in their theoretical study of force - induced denaturation of dna / rna , @xcite concluded that the opening of individual basepairs in double stranded dna can not readily be observed , but the opening of stem - loop structures in rna should be .",
    "one fairly obvious effect that could cause the smooth fec is thermal superposition of alternative secondary structures . since one may expect that typical rna structures ( such as the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ figgroup1]a ) are less well - designed than a perfect hairpin , force - induced denaturation should make more alternative structures accessible in the former case than in the latter . in our analysis",
    "below , we find that this effect is indeed non - negligible , but the largest loss of features originates from another , more subtle mechanism , which we call the ` compensation effect ' , and which persists even when no alternative secondary structures are allowed .",
    "the compensation effect depends on the fact that when several structural elements are pulled at _ in parallel _ , the optimization process that determines the minimum free energy structure with a given number @xmath7 of external open bases may _ reclose _ stretches of basepairs which had already been opened at a lower value @xmath61 .    in our approach ( see ` model and methods ' above ) , the information on the secondary structure energetics for a given sequence is entirely contained in the function @xmath62 . with the help of the polymer model ( contained in @xmath9 ) this information is translated into a fec via eq .",
    "( [ convolution ] ) .",
    "our investigation therefore comprises two steps .",
    "first , we seek to understand what property of @xmath62 determines the size of the fluctuations in the fec , and second , how this property depends on the secondary structure .        the first question is addressed most readily for the special case of the random hairpin of fig .",
    "[ figgroup1]b .",
    "it is known that in the fixed - force ensemble , unzipping of a random hairpin may be mapped onto the problem of a particle in a tilted one - dimensional random potential @xcite .",
    "the random potential is correlated and has the statistical properties of a one - dimensional random walk . in the fixed - distance ensemble",
    ", we may perform a very similar mapping ( see fig .",
    "[ figspring ] ) . here",
    ", the bias for the direction of movement of the particle is not caused by a tilt of the potential , but instead by a spring that is attached to the particle .",
    "the position of the other end of the spring is externally controlled , i.e. it is determined by @xmath1 , the given end - to - end distance of the rna molecule .    in the following ,",
    "we review the relation between the parameters of the particle - in - a - random - potential problem , i.e. the spring constant @xmath63 and the variance of the random potential , and the parameters of the unzipping problem .",
    "this will also serve us to introduce our notation for the subsequent discussion .",
    "we may write the free energy @xmath64 of the random hairpin as @xmath65 , where the @xmath66 are random with mean @xmath67 and variance @xmath68 . here , @xmath69 represents the mean binding energy per base , which depends on the gc - content of the hairpin , the temperature , and the salt concentrations , and @xmath70 measures the fluctuations of @xmath69 , both along a given hairpin and between different realizations of the random sequence .",
    "the difference between two free energies that are @xmath71 units apart , @xmath72 , then has the variance @xmath73 in the particle picture ( see fig .

    "a strongly bound region that is followed by a weakly bound one , then always leads to a rise and subsequent drop of the fec .",
    "however , with several hairpins , only the total number of exterior open bases is externally constrained , while the individual hairpins may freely open and reclose basepairs ( for equilibrium fec s there is no kinetic constraint ) .",

    "this indicates that the compensation effect is the dominant source for the smoothing of the fec .",
    "in the last section , we found that the equilibrium fec s for typical rna molecules ( like the group i intron that served us as an example ) are quite smooth and do not reveal any features that can be associated with the opening of structural elements .",
    "the compensation effect is the primary cause for this result , and we expect it to be responsible , in part , also for the experimental observation of extremely smooth fec s for single - stranded dna by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the measurement of equilibrium fec s for rna or single - stranded dna might still be useful , e.g. for an experimental determination of the rna / dna free energy parameters .",
    "usually , these are extracted from melting curves of oligomers @xcite , which requires variation of the temperature away from the temperature of interest up to the melting point of the oligomers , where the free energy and its temperature derivative are determined .",
    "the free energy parameters at the temperature of interest are then obtained by extrapolation , which introduces an error inherent to the method . for pulling experiments",
    ", the temperature can be kept constant at the value of interest , which is an obvious advantage . here",
    ", the limiting factor is only the precision of the force measurement .",
    "the quantitative relationship between stacking energy and threshold force expressed by fig .",
    "[ figfc ] furnishes the necessary link between force and energy . measuring fec s for periodic hairpins composed of different building blocks , would lead to curves like the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figgroup1]b with different values for the threshold force . from these values , the stacking energies",
    "could then be determined , which might lead to more accurate parameters at the desired temperature and salt concentrations .",
    "there are ( at least ) two options to obtain fec s with more features , which in turn might allow one to obtain information on rna secondary structure from pulling experiments .",
    "one could either record _ non - equilibrium _",
    "fec s or analyze the _ fluctuations _ around the equilibrium curve . for our theoretical investigation , the latter option is not available as long as we work in the fixed - distance ensemble , since the force fluctuations around the thermodynamic average diverge in that ensemble .",
    "we will pursue this option in a separate publication by working in a mixed ensemble ( gerland , u. , r. bundschuh , and t. hwa , in preparation ) . here , we briefly consider non - equilibrium fec s , where the rate of external increase in the force / extension is higher than ( some of ) the rates associated with internal rearrangements in the secondary structure . in the case of long _ proteins _ , either naturally occurring as an array of globular domains @xcite or synthesized protein arrays @xcite , mechanical stretching experiments resolved the unfolding of up to 20 individual domains .",
    "these experiments were performed under non - equilibrium conditions @xcite with typical pulling speeds of @xmath107 m/s .    .",
    "a generalized reaction coordinate @xmath108 is plotted along the horizontal axis and the free energy @xmath109 along the vertical axis .",
    "the work that has to be exerted against the force in order to pull in the single strand needed for the formation of the stem - loop structure is denoted by @xmath110 . in principle",
    ", the entropy difference between the random coil state on the left and the transition state also contributes to the barrier height , however , we assume that at typical stretching forces it is negligible compared to @xmath110.,width=321 ]    in order to estimate whether non - equilibrium conditions are attainable for rna with reasonable pulling speeds , we need a rough idea of the timescales involved in secondary structure rearrangements of rna . for this , we again assume that rna and single - stranded dna behave similarly , so that we may draw on an experiment by bonnet , krichevsky , and libchaber @xcite measuring the opening and closing rates of dna stem - loops using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy . from their results , we extract @xmath111 as an estimate for the closing time ( at @xmath54 ) of a stem - loop structure with three basepairs and a loop of four nucleotides , which may be considered as a minimal secondary structure element .",
    "we expect that the formation of the stem - loop takes place in a single step whose reaction pathway goes through a transition state where the basepairs of the stem have not yet formed , but the corresponding bases are already closely together ( see fig .",
    "[ loop_formation ] ) . in the presence of an external force , the closing time",
    "must then be multiplied with an arrhenius factor @xmath112 , where @xmath110 is the work that has to be exerted against the force to pull in the amount of single strand needed for the formation of the stem - loop @xcite . with a typical force of @xmath113",
    "we obtain @xmath114 , which results in a closing time on the order of @xmath115 .",
    "this timescale has to be compared to the time it takes to stretch out the stem - loop . at a pulling speed on the order of @xmath107 m/s , the two timescales are comparable and hence , both the formation of new secondary structure elements and the restoration of already opened ones are likely to be suppressed .",
    "although it is beyond the scope of this paper , we want to note that in the presence of pseudoknots and/or tertiary interactions , the formation or re - formation of structural elements is expected to be slowed down even further , due to long search times for the interaction partners .    to obtain an impression of how many features a non - equilibrium fec might show for the group i intron , we change our equilibrium algorithm , such that the rebinding of bases is disabled once they have been unbound , and include only the contribution of the minimum free energy structures instead of all possible secondary structures .",
    "this is clearly a very crude approximation . in a proper treatment ,",
    "only those kinetic processes whose energy barrier is higher than a certain threshold as determined by the pulling speed should be suppressed . also",
    ", we did not account for the fact that the opening of basepairs occurs at higher forces in non - equilibrium as a consequence of kramers theory @xcite . nevertheless , the fec shown in fig .",
    "[ fast_intron]c gives an idea of the large number of structural transitions that take place during force - induced denaturation ( for comparison , the equilibrium fec is shown again in fig .",
    "[ fast_intron]a ) .",
    "we therefore believe that non - equilibrium stretching experiments of rna could lead to interesting and useful results .",
