    "in the particle data group ( pdg ) book  @xcite the light - quark ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) baryon spectrum is composed of forty resonances rated from one ( @xmath3 to four @xmath4 stars .",
    "the pdg average  mass region below 1950 mev contains mostly four  star ( well established ) resonances , fourteen out of twenty three , the same being true for the @xmath5 strange sector , eight out of eleven .",
    "this makes this mass region the most suitable for testing any spectroscopic quark model . from the pioneering isgur and karl s non - relativistic quark model in the late 70 s  @xcite more refined spectroscopic quark models for baryons , based on two - body interactions ,",
    "have been developed  @xcite .",
    "we will refer to them as two - body quark models and we shall denote them generically as @xmath6 . as an overall result the masses of the fourteen four - star resonances , most times with the exception of @xmath7 ( see comments below ) ,",
    "are rather well predicted ( @xmath8 mev difference with the pdg average value ) by these models .",
    "regarding the five three - star ( likely to certain existence ) resonances , the situation is much less favorable since the masses of two of them , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are generally overpredicted , up to 250 mev above the pdg average value .",
    "let us note that a similar discrepancy is observed for @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 mev difference with the pdg average value ) which can be related to @xmath14 as we shall show , and for @xmath15 ( up to 200 mev above the pdg average ) . in the strange @xmath16 sector",
    "an outstanding overpredicted ( by @xmath17 mev ) state is the @xmath18 .",
    "henceforth we shall call anomalies these significantly overpredicted mass resonances .    in this article",
    "we carry out a general analysis of the anomalies : we identify them and we propose a plausible physical mechanism to give correctly account of their masses . to accomplish this task",
    "we shall first examine in detail in sec .",
    "[ secii ] the @xmath6 mass predictions and advance , through arguments of universality and consistency , the plausible role played by the coupling of three - quark components ( @xmath19 ) to relevant meson - baryon ( @xmath20 ) channels . in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] our qualitative considerations will be put on a more sound basis through a simplified model calculation .",
    "the successful description attained will drive us to prescribe in sec .",
    "[ seciv ] the implementation of these relevant @xmath20 channels in data analysis to improve the extraction of the anomalies . in sec .",
    "[ secv ] we revise alternative partial descriptions from existing quark models incorporating three - body interactions . finally , in sec .  [ secvi ] we summarize our main findings .",
    "as explained next , most anomalies may be assigned either to a large radial energy excitation or to a @xmath6 configuration with large mass induced by quark pauli blocking .",
    "we shall refer to them as large - energy - step anomalies .",
    "the @xmath9 is the first positive parity excitation of @xmath22 .",
    "the large mass for @xmath23 predicted by @xmath6 can be understood making use of an harmonic oscillator approximation , with @xmath24 symmetry ( @xmath25 for non - strange quarks the flavor is specified by the isospin @xmath26 ) .",
    "then the @xmath27 may be assigned to the @xmath28 configuration in the @xmath29 band ( we shall obviate @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 when referring to nucleon ) .",
    "the band number @xmath33 can be expressed as @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 refer to the two jacobi coordinates in a three - quark baryon and @xmath38 and @xmath39 to the corresponding orbital angular momenta .",
    "the total orbital angular momentum of the system is given by @xmath40 , and the parity @xmath41 by @xmath42 .",
    "more specifically the @xmath43 may be assigned to the first radial excitation of the @xmath44 : @xmath45 or @xmath46 and @xmath47 . from the harmonic oscillator energy ,",
    "@xmath48 being @xmath49 the angular frequency , the first radial excitation , involving an @xmath33 increase of two units , is higher in energy than the first orbital one , ( @xmath50 or @xmath46 and @xmath51 , for which @xmath33 increases only one unit .",
    "however this contradicts data since the @xmath9 has lower mass than @xmath52 or @xmath53 the lowest negative parity excitations .",
    "this inversion problem , equivalent to the mass overprediction for @xmath43 , appears also for the roper resonance , @xmath7 , lower in mass than @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "actually the solution of the roper inversion has motivated many _",
    "ad hoc _ quark model studies .",
    "being our goal to get as much as possible a general understanding of the anomalies we shall include , in parallel to @xmath9 , the roper resonance in our list .",
    "let us add that the conventional interpretation of @xmath7 and @xmath27 as radial excitations we have assumed does not preclude other configuration assignments . in @xmath7 there is mixing with the orbital excitation @xmath56 which could even be dynamically dominant . in @xmath9 an alternative interpretation in terms of orbital excitations",
    "is also feasible as we shall show later on .",
    "regarding the @xmath58 say the lowest @xmath59 energy state , it can be assigned to the @xmath60 configuration  @xcite . although the expression of @xmath33 ( @xmath61 may suggest @xmath62 , this energy band is forbidden since being a completely symmetric state in isospin , @xmath30 , and spin , @xmath63 , the spatial part should also be completely symmetric whereas @xmath62 only admits spatial states of mixed symmetry .",
    "instead @xmath64 according to parity with an @xmath33 increase of two units , hence its predicted large mass .",
    "so quark pauli blocking makes the system acquire two units of excitation , this time in the form ( @xmath65 or @xmath66 , instead of ( @xmath50 or @xmath46 .",
    "an analogous situation occurs for @xmath67 , the lowest @xmath68 pdg state .",
    "the configuration assigned , @xmath69 , can not combine with @xmath70 which only admits completely symmetric spatial states , then @xmath29 through two units of excitation ( @xmath71 , instead of ( @xmath72 .",
    "given the large radial excitation energy and the large mass predicted for quark pauli blocking induced states , one may wonder about the possibility that @xmath73 components may be energetically competitive , despite the extra quark and antiquark masses .",
    "thus , they could greatly contribute , altogether with @xmath19 components , to the formation of the bound structures was first interpreted as a hybrid state involving gluonic or nonvalence quark degrees of freedom  @xcite although this interpretation was questioned a few years later  @xcite through a revision of the role played by anharmonic perturbations . ] . in order to examine this possibility at a phenomenological level we look for @xmath74 components in the form of inelastic meson - baryon channels in relative @xmath0 wave ( the lowest energy partial wave ) with adequate quantum numbers to couple to the anomalies and with thresholds close above their pdg masses .",
    "we shall name these components meson - baryon threshold channels or @xmath75 channels .",
    "for @xmath14 a simple inspection allows us to identify the following @xmath20 channels : @xmath78 @xmath79 , and @xmath80 with thresholds at 2045 mev , 2014 mev , and 2002 mev , respectively ( let us recall that @xmath6 mass predictions are @xmath81 mev higher than the pdg average 1930 mev ) . to discriminate among these channels",
    "we notice that going further with our argumentation we should expect the presence of @xmath82 resonances close in mass to @xmath14 , whenever the same dominant configuration @xmath83 and the same relevant thresholds are present .",
    "we shall refer to these resonances as partners .",
    "it turns out that @xmath84 and @xmath85 contain that configuration ( in fact it is the only one common to these two deltas and @xmath59 below 2.2 gev ) .",
    "moreover if we examine the pdg table we find the anomalies @xmath86 and @xmath87 sharing with @xmath14 the @xmath88 and @xmath89 as @xmath20 channels .",
    "this suggests @xmath90 and @xmath76 as partners of @xmath91 and @xmath92 and/or @xmath89 as the possible relevant coupling to the binding of the three resonances .",
    "let us add for the sake of completeness that for @xmath84 and @xmath93 the @xmath6 first radial excitation @xmath94 , at about @xmath95 mev , is not far above the average mass of their anomalies .",
    "however we shall justify later on the assignment of these radial excitations to @xmath96 and to a not yet extracted @xmath97 resonance around the same energy .      an analogous analysis based on the search of @xmath20 channels",
    "can be carried out for @xmath67 with a @xmath98 mev mass overprediction from @xmath99 we find @xmath100 and @xmath101 with thresholds at 1790 mev and 1760 mev , respectively .",
    "since both thresholds involve pions with @xmath102 there can not be @xmath31 ( @xmath103 ) partners , with @xmath56 and the same relevant thresholds .",
    "in consequence we have no further phenomenological indication on which threshold may be relevant .",
    "for @xmath9 with a @xmath6 mass overprediction of @xmath81 mev , the @xmath104 channel ( threshold at @xmath105 mev ) might contribute to the binding .",
    "additionally @xmath106 with a quite uncertain @xmath0 wave threshold due to the large interval accepted for the @xmath107 mass ( @xmath108 mev ) might play some role .",
    "analogously for @xmath7 , with @xmath6 mass predictions ranging from 1410 mev to 1700 mev , the @xmath109 channel could play a relevant role .",
    "in fact , the explicit consideration of @xmath109 has allowed for a description of @xmath7 from a coupled meson - baryon channel calculation  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath110 channel , although with threshold at 1675 mev quite above the pdg mass , could also have some effect . in both cases",
    "( @xmath111 there are no partners to be examined .",
    "certainly meson - baryon channel coupling effects may be at work for other resonances not involving either large energy excitation steps or a large mass induced by quark pauli blocking .      as a matter of fact",
    "the more generally accepted anomaly is the @xmath113 which has motivated a lot of studies being mostly interpreted , at the hadron level , as an @xmath0 wave @xmath114 quasi - bound system ( in the chiral unitary approximation one of the poles couples mostly to @xmath114  @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , at the quark level , the identification of the lowest @xmath19 negative parity excitation of @xmath16 ( predicted mass about @xmath115 mev ) with @xmath112 has been suggested , the difference in mass being attributed to the mass shift induced in @xmath116 by its strong coupling to the @xmath0 wave @xmath117 channel ( threshold at 1435 mev )  @xcite .",
    "very recently a quantitative calculation along this line within a specific quark model framework has been performed  @xcite .",
    "let us remark that although these explanations are formulated in terms of different degrees of freedom ( hadrons or quarks ) they may be somehow equivalent through the effectiveness of parameters , cutoffs ...",
    "henceforth we shall assume that @xmath112 is a resonance induced by the coupling of @xmath114 to the lowest energy @xmath6 negative parity configuration with strangeness : @xmath118 and flavor singlet , @xmath119 .",
    "since @xmath102 for kaons no @xmath120 partners are expected .",
    "in fact the closest @xmath121 resonance , @xmath122 , shares the same configuration but has no coupling to @xmath123      for other light - quark resonances in the energy region under consideration ( @xmath125 mev ) the inspection of data and @xmath6 mass predictions makes us conclude that mass overpredictions are not very significant with one possible exception .",
    "this corresponds to the lowest energy state of @xmath126 since @xmath127 the minimum possible @xmath33 value is @xmath128 according to parity .",
    "@xmath6 models predict two states in the @xmath29 band with mass ranges @xmath129 mev and @xmath130 mev what seems to be in correspondence with the first and second pdg states @xmath131 and @xmath132 however the @xmath133 is bizarre since its average mass is obtained from three different data analyses , two of them  @xcite reporting a mass about @xmath134 @xmath135 mev and the other  @xcite giving a quite different value of @xmath136 mev . then by considering two differentiated resonances the @xmath137 would be a clear candidate for an anomaly .",
    "remarkably there is a @xmath20 channel , the @xmath138 with threshold at @xmath139 mev , which could contribute to the binding of this resonance at such low energy .",
    "note additionally that the @xmath6 configuration corresponding to @xmath140 ( @xmath141 and @xmath128 is forbidden in this case due to its antisymmetric orbital character .",
    "this pauli blocking does not imply though an increase in @xmath142 but an orbital reordering of the quarks to an available @xmath143 , @xmath128 configuration , hence its regular - energy - step character .",
    "therefore we will tentatively identify the @xmath124 as the lowest energy state of @xmath144 and interpret it as another meson - baryon , @xmath138 , induced resonance . for its @xmath6 configuration assignment",
    "there are two options : i ) @xmath145 and ii ) @xmath146 .",
    "if we opt for i ) this configuration is also present in @xmath147 where it could couple to @xmath148 with threshold at @xmath149 mev .",
    "it turns out that @xmath150 is almost degenerate to @xmath151 sharing the same dominant configuration @xmath152 .",
    "then we should expect a companion resonance of @xmath137 in @xmath147 at about the same energy . by revisiting the pdg book",
    "we find that @xmath9 is assigned a mass around @xmath153 mev in refs .",
    "@xcite in agreement with our expectation",
    ". therefore our proposal of a distinctive @xmath154 should be complemented with the consideration of the current @xmath23 as a superposition of a resonance , companion of @xmath155 and of the @xmath6 first radial excitation configuration which could also be affected by some @xmath20 channel .",
    "complementarily configuration ii ) which is present in @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 , would be assigned to @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "the almost degenerate mass of these resonances seems to support this correspondence .",
    "if instead we opt for ii ) the same conclusion about the structure of @xmath23 would be obtained since ii ) also appears in @xmath162 .",
    "besides , as mentioned , ii ) is also present in @xmath163 where it could couple to @xmath100 with threshold at 1790 mev ( note that @xmath164 is almost degenerate and shares configuration with @xmath165 ) .",
    "then we should expect another companion resonance of @xmath124 in @xmath166 we could identify this companion as the @xmath67 . in consequence we should conclude that the @xmath6 quark pauli blocking induced configuration previously considered for @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath167 , should be instead assigned to the next @xmath168 resonance @xmath169 ( note that in such a case no coupling to any relevant @xmath20 channel would be needed for this configuration ) .",
    "complementarily configuration i ) would give account in this case of @xmath170 and @xmath160 .",
    "unfortunately being in any case a resonance induced through pions , @xmath102 , there are no @xmath171 partners which could help to decide in favor of one of the options .",
    "to finish this section we represent in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the @xmath6 mass predictions based on ref .",
    "@xcite ( the numerical values will be given in table  [ t2 ] ) as compared to the experimental mass intervals for the anomalies .",
    "to go beyond the qualitative analysis of the anomalies we have carried out some dynamical input is required . in the last years",
    "there has been an important progress in the development of dynamical coupled - channel ( dcc ) models of @xmath172 scattering in the resonance region below @xmath173 gev lee07,bru07,spe03 .",
    "these models introduce bare baryon states to represent the quark core components of the resonances .",
    "such components can be identified with constituent quark model predictions .",
    "the resonance , @xmath174 associated with a bare baryon state is induced by effective vertex interactions @xmath175 and @xmath176 . in practice",
    "the masses of the bare states are parameters of the model which are determined by fitting data ( other parameters as effective coupling constants and form factors are fixed , as much as possible , within reasonable ranges ) .",
    "the most recent fit to @xmath172 elastic scattering data ( not including @xmath177 @xcite indicates clearly that bare masses are higher than the pdg s resonance positions .",
    "this suggests these coupled - channel schemes as the appropriate frameworks for a thorough study of the anomalies .",
    "however this is a formidable task out of the scope of this article which has a rather exploratory character .",
    "instead we shall perform a simplified quark model calculation along the lines followed in the meson case to evaluate @xmath178 effects  @xcite .",
    "we shall consider a system of one confined channel , the @xmath6 , in interaction with one free - channel , a meson - baryon threshold channel @xmath20 , with a hamiltonian matrix : @xmath179\\simeq \\left (   \\begin{array}{cc } m_{m}+m_{b } & a \\\\",
    "a^{\\ast } & m_{3q^{2b}}% \\end{array}% \\right)\\]]where @xmath180 stands for the mass of the @xmath6 state , @xmath181 and @xmath182 for the masses of the meson and baryon respectively and @xmath183 for a fitting parameter giving account of the interaction ( @xmath183 could correspond for instance to a @xmath184 transition hamiltonian matrix element ) .",
    "the effect of the interaction on the masses is easily obtained by diagonalization .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath185where @xmath186 is smaller that @xmath187 and @xmath188 is bigger than @xmath189 .",
    "it is noteworthy the correspondence between this simplified model and a truncated dcc model calculation .",
    "so @xmath180 represents a bare resonance mass , @xmath181 and @xmath190 meson and baryon masses which have been approximated by the experimental values , and @xmath183 a constant giving account of the bare resonance@xmath191 effective coupling .    in order to proceed to calculate the eigenvalues we have to choose a particular @xmath6 model and establish a criterion for the choice of the @xmath192 channel for each anomaly",
    "we shall use as @xmath180 the values calculated in ref .  @xcite . since",
    "only the energy band and not the detailed configuration corresponding to each value has been published an educated guess has been done .",
    "as @xmath20 we shall take for granted the @xmath117 channel for @xmath112 . for @xmath193 @xmath76 and @xmath86 we shall select @xmath89 ( equivalently we could have preferred the almost degenerate @xmath194 as suggested by our phenomenological analysis .",
    "for the same reason @xmath138 will be employed for @xmath195 for @xmath67 we shall use @xmath196 since this coupling is favored at least in one of the two possible configuration assignments previously discussed .",
    "regarding @xmath7 and @xmath9 the situation is rather intricate due to the alternative interpretations ( radial and/or orbital excitations ) available . from the particular @xmath6 model we use , the value @xmath197 mev corresponding to a dominant first radial excitation of @xmath198 ,",
    "can be unambiguously assigned to @xmath199 then if we use the nominal pdg average value for the @xmath200 mass ( @xmath201 mev ) the @xmath109 threshold is about the same energy than @xmath180 and closer to the pdg mass of the roper than @xmath110 with threshold at 1675 mev .",
    "this suggests the selection of the energetically more competitive @xmath109 channel as the possible relevant one .",
    "we should keep in mind though that the selection could be different favoring @xmath202 for other choices of the @xmath200 mass and the @xmath6 model .",
    "actually given the large mass and width of the @xmath200 it is also possible that both @xmath20 channels may be contributing to the binding .",
    "consequently our selection should be considered as an effective one getting an insight into the relevant meson - baryon threshold effects .    concerning the @xmath9 it could be just the companion of @xmath137 with the @xmath6 first radial excitation of @xmath203 being hidden in its large width .",
    "however , although with different values of @xmath26 and @xmath204 the first radial excitations of @xmath171 and @xmath198 share the same @xmath24 configuration . on the other hand the @xmath205 components of the respective @xmath20 channels ( @xmath54 _ vs. _ @xmath206 and @xmath171 _ vs.",
    "_ @xmath207 also share @xmath208 configuration .",
    "then it seems natural to assume that meson - baryon threshold effects may be also acting on the first radial excitation of the @xmath82 .",
    "moreover the low pdg average mass of @xmath23 as compared to @xmath134 mev , the approximated mass of the companion resonance mentioned above , seems to reinforce this idea . by using again the pdg nominal @xmath209 mass",
    "we realize that only the @xmath210 channel has now a threshold ( at 1660 mev ) below the @xmath211 first radial excitation at 1790 mev .",
    "this suggests the selection of @xmath104 as the relevant @xmath20 channel ( the same caution and comments as in the roper case should be applied here ) .",

    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a look at table  [ t3 ] shows that for @xmath124 and @xmath120 the @xmath188 state can be clearly assigned altogether with the next @xmath6 state to the next pdg resonances @xmath212 and @xmath213 respectively . in the first case both @xmath188 and the next @xmath6 mass are above the next pdg mass whilst in the second case both lye below it .",
    "this is in accord with the quite general quark model tendency of over ( under ) prediction for states in the @xmath214 bands .",
    "the same type of assignment can be done for @xmath86 where the @xmath188 and the next @xmath6 masses lye respectively close above and below the next pdg mass average @xmath215 . for the sake of consistency",
    "we should also expect @xmath216 and @xmath97 resonances around 2150 mev which have not been reported .",
    "this may have to do with the bigger proliferation of @xmath6 states about that energy ( three for @xmath217 and four for @xmath218 against two for @xmath219 what may make difficult its experimental disentanglement",
    ". indeed the large width of @xmath14 may be also including the effect of the missed resonance . in any case",
    "there is need of further data analysis to clarify the situation .    for @xmath67 the @xmath188 state could also play some role in its large width",
    "although an assignment to @xmath169 seems the most logical .    finally for @xmath7 and @xmath9 the @xmath188 states with masses 85 mev below @xmath220 and @xmath221 respectively may be influencing the large widths of the anomalies as well as the widths of these next pdg states .",
    "let us note that the expression given above for the eigenvalues is symmetric under the exchange of @xmath180 and @xmath222 then mass corrections to @xmath6 states could alternatively come from meson - baryon channels above the @xmath6 mass predictions .",
    "however for an anomaly with @xmath211 mass prediction far above the pdg average we do not expect these contributions to be physically relevant in the sense of having any effect on its mass .",
    "actually , in our simplified treatment a much larger value of @xmath223 would be required to get a correct mass shift from these thresholds , putting into question the very validity of the model . on the other hand , @xmath20 channels different than the selected ones",
    "could have dynamically some effects through higher partial waves .",
    "in the spirit of quark model calculations we consider the @xmath20 channels we have selected ( which may not have a precise experimental correspondence ) as effective ones giving account of the couplings of @xmath6 states with meson - baryon components .",
    "most light - quark baryon resonances are extracted from data through a parametrization of @xmath172 scattering partial waves .",
    "this usually refers to a multichannel scattering matrix including effective inelastic channels .",
    "the consideration of multichannel couplings becomes relevant when an important channel opens within the width of a resonance .",
    "let us emphasize that this is so even if the threshold of the channel is above the mass of the resonance .",
    "actually the consideration of the @xmath109 ( also named @xmath224 channel as an effective inelastic channel in some data analyses becomes relevant for the experimental extraction of the roper resonance @xmath225 , see for instance reference  @xcite . in parallel the extraction of @xmath14 as a distinctive resonance is associated in some data analysis to the explicit inclusion of a @xmath226 effective inelastic channel  @xcite .",
    "hence a certain correspondence between efficient inelastic channels in data analyses and our selected meson - baryon threshold channels considered for the anomalies shows up for @xmath14 and @xmath7 .",
    "this suggests the generalization of this correspondence .",
    "therefore we propose the explicit inclusion in data analyses of the selected meson - baryon threshold channels in order to make easier the extraction of the anomalies . in this way",
    "an improvement ( star - number increase ) over the current pdg star - status could result for all of them as well as consistency among different analysis of approximately the same set of data might be attained .",
    "we shall call rep ( resonance extraction prescription ) this proposal .",
    "our description of the anomalies does not exclude in principle other possible equivalent effective treatments .",
    "as already mentioned alternative explanations based on poles in a meson - baryon coupled channel approach can be also found in the literature for @xmath7 and @xmath113 . in this last case",
    "even a meson - baryon bound state interpretation is feasible . from the point of view of quark",
    "approaches it is worthwhile to comment that for light - quark baryons there exist at least two quark model calculations in the literature beyond @xmath6 , giving a proper account of the masses of the large - energy - step anomalies .",
    "one of these models  @xcite incorporates a two - sigma exchange potential apart from a one - gluon exchange and confinement interactions .",
    "the other is a collective model where baryons appear as vibrations and rotations of a three - quark @xmath227-shaped string - like configuration  @xcite .",
    "the energy systematic of these models is such that the energy step associated to a radial excitation or a quark pauli blocking induced configuration gets reduced to approximately half of its @xmath6 value in agreement with data . on the contrary the predictions for regular - energy - step states do not vary significantly from @xmath99",
    "this explains why the @xmath112 is out of the systematic ( ref .",
    "@xcite predicts a mass of 1550 mev and ref .",
    "@xcite 1640 mev ) as well as it would be the @xmath228 ( 1830 mev in  @xcite and 1921 mev in  @xcite ) in case of its confirmation as a distinctive resonance .",
    "let us notice though that these exceptions could be put in their right masses by coupling them to the relevant meson - baryon threshold channels . in this manner",
    "a description of similar quality to the one in sec .  [ seciii ] could be reached .",
    "note that the correct large - energy - step model predictions would not require now relevant meson - baryon threshold channels .",
    "therefore an alternative spectral description where the large - energy - step anomalies correspond to @xmath19 states is feasible .",
    "to summarize we propose that @xmath73 components , in the form of @xmath0 wave meson - baryon channels which we identify , play an essential role in the description of the anomalies , say baryon resonances very significantly overpredicted by three - quark models based on two - body interactions . as a matter of fact by considering a simplified description of the anomalies as systems composed of a free meson - baryon channel interacting with a three - quark confined component we have shown they could correspond mostly to meson - baryon states but with a non - negligible @xmath19 state probability which makes their masses to be below the meson - baryon threshold",

    "for the other identified anomalies , @xmath230 @xmath193 @xmath76 , @xmath86 , @xmath231 @xmath112 and the non - cataloged @xmath232 the meson - baryon component probability is magnified .    though it is probable that these results may vary quantitatively when a more complete dynamical coupled - channel calculation is carried out we think it is reasonable not to expect major qualitative changes .",
    "then it is plausible , given their dominant meson - baryon character , that the roper resonance and specially the other _ magnificent seven _ anomalies be dynamically generated via simplified effective meson - baryon and/or meson - meson - baryon coupled channel calculations involving only a selected number of channels and couplings .",
    "indeed this has been shown for @xmath7 and @xmath233 the effectiveness of the parameters possibly taking implicitly into account the nonconsidered three - quark components .",
    "in particular the effective dynamical generation of @xmath234 could be interpreted as given a strong support to our proposal of considering it a distinctive resonance .",
    "effective meson - baryon coupled channel studies would be also welcome to clarify the situation for other anomalies where alternative three - quark descriptions are available .",
    "the information obtained in this manner could be complemented with the one coming from quark model evaluations of hadronic transition processes in order to shed some light on the very detailed nature of the anomalies . with respect to this",
    "let us remind that the three - body quark  and the two - body quark + meson - baryon  wave functions may be rather different .",
    "more complete studies are also needed to extract some conclusion about the possible anomalous character of some other resonances , apart from the roper , in the nucleon sector .",
    "our easy identification of most @xmath82 anomalies may have to do with the quite small mixing present in their assigned anomalous configurations .",
    "actually mixing with non - anomalous ones might play a role for some nucleon excitations making them not to show up as very significantly overpredicted mass states .",
    "particularly states in the @xmath128 band : @xmath235 @xmath236 @xmath237 , would deserve attention .    to finish we should comment on the possible drawbacks of our approach .",
    "our description , based on a phenomenological analysis and on a healing formula for mass corrections to quark models predictions , relies on the assumption of a significant coupling between specific @xmath19 states and relevant meson - baryon channels .",
    "no physical mechanism underlying these particular couplings is detailed .",
    "indeed , our effective treatment might correspond to different physical mechanisms depending on the anomaly .",
    "note that for @xmath120 , at difference with @xmath171 cases , a diquark dominant induced coupling seems to be favored .",
    "moreover , the consideration that our effective meson - baryon threshold channel might be either replacing the influence of other couplings ( including other meson - baryon partial waves ) or even correcting three - quark models dynamical deficiencies may be too naive . besides we should keep in mind that except for @xmath23 and @xmath14 the existence of all the magnificent anomalies is fair or poorly established rating @xmath238 or @xmath239 in the pdg book or even non - cataloged ( @xmath240 . actually as established by the pdg editors most high lying states are questionable .",
    "hence the possibility that some of them do not remain in time is opened .    keeping in mind these caveats the universality , consistency and simplicity of our description",
    "make us confident that the implemented physical ingredients will remain essential in further theoretical evaluations . on the other hand from the experimental point of view the application of our resonance extraction proposal ( rep ) of implementing",
    "selected meson - baryon threshold channels in data analyses might add certainty to the existence of some resonances and at the same time help to reconcile competing and sometimes not very compatible partial wave analyses .",
