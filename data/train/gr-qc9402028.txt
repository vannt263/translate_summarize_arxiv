    "one of the most important results in quantum cosmology has been the suggestion that the very early universe might be described by an euclidean manifold .",
    "this idea arises from the interpretation of the behaviour of wave function of the universe which is very similar to the behaviour of the wave function of a particle in a classically forbidden region .",
    "thus , euclidean universes should be a natural feature of quantum cosmology .",
    "however , recent works have shown that solutions of einstein s equations with change of signature might be possible @xcite also as a part of classical theory . the hamiltonian formulation of general relativity ( adm formalism ) @xcite is particularly well adapted to the study of the signature change .",
    "indeed , it is conceived in the very beginning as a slicing of the four - dimensional spacetime into three - dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "the geometry of these hypersurfaces contains the true degrees of freedom of the theory , whereas the way how the hypersurfaces are stacked together is essentially arbitrary and depends on the dynamics .",
    "one of the aims of this article is to show how we can construct a slightly modified usual hamiltonian formalism in order to incorporate classical euclidean solutions .",
    "then , we study the consequences of the dynamical change of signature on the metric of the superspace .",
    "we prove that euclidean solutions correspond to a region in the superspace where signature of the metric is ( @xmath1 ) instead of ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "finally , we consider the quantization of this model of gravitation .",
    "since the classical euclidean solutions do exist , it seems interesting to find out how the corresponding wave function behaves and to compare its behaviour with the behaviour of the wave functions which are interpreted as describing euclidean regions of the universe .",
    "another motivation is that the change of signature could occur during the planck epoch @xcite . in that case",
    "the quantum theoretical approach would become necessary .",
    "in this section we show how classical einstein s solutions with change of signature can be obtained by means of a slight modification of the adm formalism of general relativity .",
    "we consider a four - dimensional manifold ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) whose structure can be symbolized by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a submanifold endowed with an euclidean metric ( signature @xmath6 ) whereas @xmath7 is endowed with a lorentzian metric ( signature @xmath8 ) .",
    "these two submanifolds are matched together at @xmath9 , the surface of change of the signature on which @xmath3 is degenerate .",
    "an additional difficulty arises while considering the adm formalism since the basic idea of the hamiltonian formulation of general relativity consists in slicing along the timelike coordinate the four - dimensional manifold into three - dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces and in following the evolution of these hypersurfaces in time . in the euclidean region , space and time are completely equivalent and there is no a priori direction which could be considered as being the coordinate with respect to which the slicing should be performed .",
    "however , the time coordinate of the lorentzian region induces in the vicinity of the separating surface @xmath9 a privileged direction in the euclidean region which will be chosen in order to slice the submanifold @xmath5 . following the notations adopted by ellis et al .",
    "@xcite , let us define the symbol @xmath10 to be equal to @xmath11 on @xmath5 and @xmath12 on @xmath7 : @xmath13 the three - dimensional hypersurfaces are endowed with the metric @xmath14 .",
    "then , the metric @xmath3 can be written as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the usual lapse and shift functions of the adm formalism @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath10 in front of the first term takes into account the fact that the distance between two neighbour points ( nothing else than the pythagoras theorem ! ) is calculated differently according to the signature .",
    "we note that the proper time elapsed between two points with the same spacelike coordinates is now given by the formula : @xmath18 then , the metric of the manifold @xmath2 can be written as : @xmath19 with @xmath20 allowed to take on any real values , which leads to the possibility of including the signature changes .",
    "the inverse metric is : @xmath21 we have to examine now how the extrinsic curvature can be expressed in such a manifold .",
    "let @xmath22 be the vector perpendicular to the congruence of three - dimensional hypersurfaces , @xmath23 the vector associated to the timelike coordinate @xmath24 and @xmath25 three basic ( coordinate ) vectors of the spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "the obvious relation holds : @xmath26 from which follows that the contravariant and covariant components of the vector @xmath22 are : @xmath27 to compute the extrinsic curvature , we use the following coordinate - independent formula : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the lie derivative with respect to the vector field @xmath22 . in terms of lapse and shift functions , the above relation can be written as : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the intrinsic covariant derivative on the three - dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces . using the expression ( [ 5 ] ) of the metric",
    ", we can now compute the components of the ricci tensor .",
    "they are given by : @xmath32 we note that the last two terms in the expression of @xmath33 are not present in the analogous formula without change of signature ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the other terms are , in general , slighty modified in comparison with the usual formula ( typically , @xmath20 is replaced by @xmath34 ) .",
    "however , the term @xmath10 appears sometimes outside the square root of the lapse function and we shall see that the consequences of this simple fact will be very important .",
    "the expression giving the ( @xmath35)-components of the ricci tensor is : @xmath36 as in the previous case , we note that the last term is absent in the usual expression .",
    "the space - space components of the ricci tensor can be written as : @xmath37 here again , an extra term ( the last one ) is present",
    ". then , using the expression of the inverse metric , we can compute the ricci scalar ; after quite straightforward calculations , we find the following expression : @xmath38 some of the additional terms have been eliminated , but an extra term still remains . noting that : @xmath39 we can re - express the formula for the ricci scalar curvature ; it takes the following form : @xmath40 now , we can compute the einstein - hilbert lagrangian with change of signature , which is @xmath41 using the previous expression for r , we obtain the following definition of the lagrangian of the gravitational field : @xmath42 this equation looks like the usual one since it contains three parts , one being composed by the kinetic and potential terms , the two others representing surface terms . however , we note the presence of the factor @xmath43 in the dynamical term .",
    "the extra terms have disappeared or have been incorporated in the surface terms which are slighty modified in comparison with the case without the change of signature . in",
    "what follows , we shall drop out the surface terms and shall consider only the lagrangian @xmath44 defined by : @xmath45=h^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\sqrt{\\epsilon n}({}^{(3)}r+",
    "\\epsilon k_{ij}k^{ij}-\\epsilon k^2)\\ ] ] starting from the previous equation , we can perform now full hamiltonian analysis .",
    "the conjugate momenta are given by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "equation ( [ 29 ] ) shows that @xmath44 is a constrained lagrangian and therefore requires the use of the dirac formalism developed especially to treat this kind of systems @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ 30 ] ) can be inversed to provide the following expression for @xmath48 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "the canonical hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath51 integrating by parts and dropping out the surface term , we obtain : @xmath52 where the expressions of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are : @xmath55 @xmath53 can be written in such a way that the metric of the superspace appears explicitly : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is defined by : @xmath58 we see that the only effect of the change of signature is to modify the respective sign between the kinetic part and the potential part in the definition of the hamiltonian ( [ 37 ] ) . in other words , the change from an euclidean signature to a lorentzian signature in the physical manifold @xmath2 induces a change in the superspace from the signature ( @xmath0 ) to the signature ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we note that the superspace metric remains globally hyperbolic even if the metric of @xmath2 happens to be euclidean .",
    "this becomes more explicit if we define the coordinate @xmath59 in the superspace following @xcite : @xmath60 and five coordinates @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) orthogonal ( in the sens of the supermetric ) to @xmath59 .",
    "then , the interval in the superspace takes on the form : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the metric of a five - dimensional subspace of the superspace whose signature is ( @xmath65 ) . using previous relations",
    ", we can compute the curvature invariants ( @xmath66 for example ) and the geodesics in the superspace @xcite and show that all these quantities are well - behaving when the change of signature from ( @xmath0 ) to ( @xmath1 ) occurs .",
    "this suggests another argument in favor of considering the solutions of einstein s equations with change of signature , since there exist a priori no reason for studying only a limited region of the superspace .    in the next section",
    ", we are going to consider minisuperspaces and to show how the equations of motion can be found using the dirac formalism for constrained systems .",
    "in this section , we restrict our considerations to minisuperspaces @xcite .",
    "this means that we impose very strong symmetry conditions on the solutions so that almost all degrees of freedom are frozen , except a few ones , which leads to the superspace of finite dimension in which the analytic computations and finite integrations can be performed .",
    "the coordinates @xmath67 in the minisuperspace are the components of the metric tensor and eventually the fields describing the matter . in the case of change of the signature",
    ", the lagrangian can be written as : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the metric @xmath57 restricted to the minisuperspace , and the canonical hamiltonian deduced from the above expression of the lagrangian is given by : @xmath70 in what follows , we shall suppose that the manifold has the geometry of a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe : @xmath71 where @xmath72 can take on the values @xmath73 according to the case where the three - dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces are flat , open or closed .",
    "the matter will be described by a unique scalar field .",
    "putting equation ( [ 43 ] ) in the expression ( [ 28 ] ) of the lagangian , we find that the action for the gravitational field can be written as : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a dimensional constant . with the assumption that the scalar field is spatially homogeneous , that is to say @xmath76 , the action of the matter takes on the form : @xmath77 the full lagrangian of the system ( gravitational field and scalar field ) , @xmath78 is given by : @xmath79 where the potential @xmath80 is defined by : @xmath81 the metric @xmath69 of the minisuperspace can readily be obtained from the expression of @xmath82 : @xmath83 as announced , the signature of the metric of the minisuperspace changes from ( @xmath84 ) to ( @xmath85 ) when the signature of the frw metric becomes lorentzian .",
    "we can now compute the conjugate momenta : @xmath86 the last equality is a primary constraint and is a consequence of the gauge invariance of general relativity ( thus , following dirac s classification , it is also a _ first class _ constraint ) .",
    "the canonical hamiltonian is given by : @xmath87 one can easily verify that @xmath88 has the form given by the equation ( [ 42 ] ) .",
    "then , the total hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a lagrange multiplier . according to the dirac algorithm for constrained systems",
    ", we have to check that the primary constraint @xmath91 ( @xmath92 is the dirac weak equality ) is preserved in time : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the poisson bracket in the minisuperspace defined by : ] ] @xmath95 this leads to the secondary constraint : @xmath96 we note the difference in comparison with the usual case where we obtain @xmath97 .",
    "one have to be very carefull since equation ( [ 57 ] ) has the form @xmath98 .",
    "earliest works @xcite have shown that if we assume that the last relation implies @xmath99 or @xmath100 , this can lead to a contradiction with the dirac conjecture which states that all secondary first class constraints must generate symmetries . therefore , at this stage , we are not allowed to deduce @xmath97 from equation ( [ 57 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the relation @xmath101 holds , it implies that for all functions @xmath102 , the equation @xmath103 must hold , too . for consistency , the secondary constraints must be preserved in time : @xmath104 according to the previous discussion .",
    "thus , there are no further constraints .",
    "the two constraints are first class ones since their poisson bracket vanishes .",
    "the extended hamiltonian can be written now as : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a lagrange multiplier .",
    "we can note that this expression is different from the usual one ( i.e @xmath107 ) .",
    "finally , we want to show how the equations of motion can be deduced from the extended hamiltonian .",
    "the hamilton equations are : @xmath108 this equation shows that @xmath20 is completely arbitrary since its derivative is equal to the lagrange multiplier .",
    "next , @xmath109 where we have used the constraints to transform the weak equality into a strong one .",
    "@xmath110 but as we have just seen with expression ( [ 62 ] ) , @xmath20 is arbitrary .",
    "therefore , the last equation can be written as : @xmath111 the equation of motion for @xmath112 is given by : @xmath113 for the scalar field , we obtain : @xmath114 the dynamical equation for the conjugate momentum of the scalar field is : @xmath115 it is now straightforward to show that the previous equations are equivalent to the equations already found in earlier papers @xcite describing the change of signature of a frw universe filled with a scalar field : @xmath116 thus , we have verified that the hamiltonian formalism adapted to the case including the change of signature , used with care , provides the right equations of motion .",
    "obviously , the choice of @xmath20 remains to be made in order to obtain a good junction condition .",
    "this point has been discussed with more details in refs . @xcite .",
    "following the suggestion of hartle and hawking @xcite , we shall suppose that an euclidean region could have existed in the very early universe . in this regime , the behaviour of the wave function of the universe corresponds to the behaviour of a wave function of usual quantum mechanics in a classically forbidden region .",
    "however , we have seen that classical euclidean solutions of einstein s equations can also exist , so that the problem of quantization of such solutions and of the behaviour of the wave function in the euclidean regime naturally arises .",
    "let us study this problem now .",
    "we want to quantize a theory with the constraints of first class described by the extended hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath117 according to the prescriptions of dirac , this leads to the relations : @xmath118 @xmath119 the last equation resulting from the fact that the wave function @xmath120 does not depend on @xmath20 ( see the equation ( [ 83 ] ) ) .",
    "consequently , the wheeler - de witt equation is given by @xcite : @xmath121 where the hat on the symbols denoting the operators has been omitted .",
    "if we multiply by @xmath122 , we obtain : @xmath123 now , we can interpret the change of signature in a different way : the last equation has the usual wheeler - de witt form ( no change from ( @xmath84 ) to ( @xmath85 ) ) , but the potential is modified by the factor @xmath43 which takes into account the difference of signs between the euclidean and lorentzian regions : @xmath124 in other words , all the effects of the signature change have been incorporated into the potential term only . because of the presence of factor @xmath43 , we have to check if @xmath125 is well - behaving at the surface of change @xmath9 . if we assume that @xmath126 , then the equation ( [ 81 ] ) becomes : @xmath127 if we require the continuity of the scale factor and of its first derivative , this provides a criterion ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) for determining the value of @xmath128 at which the change of signature does occur : @xmath129 this criterion assures that the potential @xmath125 is continuous ( but not its derivative ) when the change of signature occurs . equation ( [ 86 ] ) leads to a differential equation if we apply the correspondence principle , that is to say when we replace the square of the conjugate momentum according to the usual rule @xcite : @xmath130 where the exponent @xmath131 takes into account the operator - ordering problem . in",
    "what follows , we shall assume that @xmath132 in order to obtain a differential equation which can be solved analytically .",
    "we shall also assume that the scalar field ( and therefore the potential @xmath133 ) is constant and plays the r^ ole of a cosmological term in einstein s equations .",
    "this will enable us to find a connection with the classical solutions displaying a change of signature already found in @xcite and @xcite . with these assumptions",
    ", the wheeler - de witt equation can be written as : @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 . by defining @xmath137 ,",
    "the above equation becomes : @xmath138 which is the differential equation defining the airy functions @xcite .",
    "the general solution of the wheeler - de witt equation is given in this case by : @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the airy functions of first kind and second kind .",
    "@xmath142 and @xmath143 are arbitrary functions of the parameter @xmath144 .",
    "when the scale factor @xmath145 comes close to zero , the term @xmath146 can be neglected and the wheeler - de witt equation can be written as : @xmath147 the condition @xmath148 implies that @xmath43 must be equal to @xmath11 . then , @xmath149 is a constant and does not depend on @xmath144 .",
    "since @xmath150 , the general solution ( [ 95 ] ) is ( in what follows we shall put a `` cs '' superscript meaning  change of signature \" to distinguish the wave functions obtained here from the wave functions of usual quantum cosmology ) : @xmath151 in order to determine the value of @xmath152 and @xmath153 , we have to solve the problem of boundary conditions of quantum cosmology .",
    "let us analyze the difference between the wave functions ( [ 97 ] ) and those of usual quantum cosmology in each region separately ( i.e. for @xmath154 ) . in the region where @xmath155 , the wkb solutions of the wheeler - de witt equation take on the form",
    ": @xmath156 in the simplified model considered here , the wave function of the universe is formally equivalent to a wave function of a particle with energy equal to zero @xcite . since for @xmath157 , the potential of the usual wheeler - de witt equation is positive , this region is classically forbidden and we obtain an exponential behaviour @xmath158 , where @xmath159 denotes the euclidean action : this phenomenon is the well - known tunnel effect . the fact that the wave function @xmath160 adopts an oscillatory behaviour seems quite natural here since , due to the value @xmath11 of the term @xmath43 , the potential is now negative and the energy of the fictitious particle is above this value , so that the euclidean region is no longer forbidden .",
    "using wigner s functions @xcite or canonical transformations @xcite it is easy to show that oscillatory behaviour means that @xmath160 carries quantum correlations .",
    "obviously , these correlations correspond to the classical solutions of einstein s equations with change of signature .    in the region @xmath161",
    ", the wave function is supposed to describe our universe and we can use it for cosmological interpretations . the predictions coming from @xmath160 should be compared with those coming from the wave functions of ordinary quantum cosmology ( written without `` cs '' superscript ) .",
    "to fix the wave function , we have to solve the problem of boundary conditions .",
    "many propositions have been made , one of the best known is the `` no boundary '' proposition of hawking and hartle @xcite .",
    "the wave function on the three - dimensional hypersurface @xmath162 is constructed by performing the euclidean path integral : @xmath163=\\sum _ { m}\\int { \\cal d}g_{\\mu \\nu } { \\cal d}\\phi \\exp ( -i[g_{\\mu \\nu } , \\phi])\\ ] ] where the sum is taken over all manifolds @xmath2 having @xmath162 as part of their boundary and over all metrics @xmath3 and matter fields @xmath164 which induce @xmath165 and @xmath166 on @xmath162 ; @xmath159 denotes the euclidean action .",
    "the proposal of hawking and hartle consists in restricting the sum to compact four - dimensional manifolds @xmath2 whose only boundary is @xmath162 . in the case of the minisuperspace",
    "considered , this would lead to a wave function which takes on the form ( @xmath167 , @xmath168 ) : @xmath169 we do nt know how to compute @xmath170 .",
    "another well - known choice is the tunneling boundary condition of vilenkin @xcite .",
    "the wave function is assumed to have only a wkb component @xmath171 in the semi - classical regime .",
    "this choice is made in order to describe the birth of the universe that might be interpreted as the tunnel effect of common quantum mechanics .",
    "this leads to the following wave functions ( @xmath167 , @xmath172 ) : @xmath173 @xmath174 and @xmath175 do not coincide , in the region where @xmath176 , only because of the presence of @xmath177 instead of @xmath178 in the argument of the airy functions of the denominator .",
    "clearly , this is true for all boundary conditions .",
    "it comes from the fact that while computing the denominator , we used the condition @xmath179 fixed in the region @xmath180 where the classical theories are not identical .",
    "as we shall see , this will have important consequences .",
    "another boundary condition seems also quite natural .",
    "it consists in assuming the continuity of the first derivative of the wave function at points at which the change of signature occurs : @xmath181 we remind that it happens at @xmath182 or @xmath183 .",

    "all the solutions display inflationary behaviour , but the rate of inflation depends on the value of @xmath222 @xcite .",
    "to find what is the most probable value of @xmath222 given by the wave function , we have to use the prefactor of the wkb solutions .",

    "then , in spite of its nice form , the choice leading to @xmath188 must not be considered .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this problem would occur for all the wave functions with classical change of signature except for @xmath201 : this is a direct consequence of the hamiltonian quantization with the change of signature .",
    "indeed , the denominator in the expression ( [ 97 ] ) leads , when we take its asymptotic form , to trigonometric functions which possess lot of zeros and therefore produces divergencies .",
