    "on 9 january 2008 , a luminous x - ray transient was discovered during follow - up observations of sn 2007uy in ngc 2770 with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) onboard  @xcite .",
    "the transient event , which lasted about 600 s before decaying to the background level , was later confirmed to occur in the same galaxy of sn 2007uy ( at redshift @xmath2 ) by the observation of an optical counterpart and a supernova ( sn ) , named sn 2008d , accompanying the transient ( deng & zhu 2008 ; immler et al .",

    "the sn underwent a transition from type ic to type ib @xcite , similar to the case of sn 2005bf @xcite .",
    "in addition , the spectra of the sn exhibited rather broad features at early epochs , although not as broad as the earliest spectra of the so - called ` hypernovae ' associated with gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) such as sn 1998bw and sn 2006aj @xcite . despite these unusual characteristics compared to typical sne ibc like 1994i , i call sn 2008d a ` normal ' sn as opposed to broad - lined grb - sne like 1998bw as suggested by other people @xcite",
    ".    the nature of the transient 080109 is debatable .",
    "several possibilities for the nature have been proposed : ( a ) sn shock breakout @xcite ; ( b ) x - ray flash ( xrf , the soft version of a grb ) ( berger & soderberg 2008 , xu , zou & fan 2008 ) ; ( c ) x - ray flare of a grb @xcite .    the total energy emitted by the transient is @xmath3 erg in the xrt energy range @xmath4@xmath5 kev ( section [ data ] ) .",
    "although this energy is within the range predicted for shock breakout in sne ibc @xcite and the transient occurred ahead of sn 2008d , the spectrum of the transient is not a blackbody , and the event duration is too long for a typical shock breakout event in a type ibc sn @xcite .",
    "hence , the shock breakout interpretation does not seem to be correct ( stronger arguments are given in section [ shock ] ; see also xu et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the transient 080109 was in the field of view of the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard  beginning half an hour before and continuing throughout the outburst . however , no gamma - ray counterpart was detected @xcite",
    ". hence , it is also unlikely that the transient was an x - ray flare of a grb .",
    "then , the only remaining interpretation on the nature of the transient 080109 is that it is an xrf . in this paper",
    "i will show that , despite its extremely soft spectrum compared to that of a normal xrf or a grb , the transient 080109 is naturally interpreted as an xrf in the context of the grb - sn connection .    an important discovery in the observation of grbs has been the connection between long - duration grbs ( with a duration @xmath6  s ) and sne ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "so far , four pairs of spectroscopically confirmed grbs / sne have been discovered : grb 980425/ sn 1998bw @xcite , grb 030329/sn 2003dh @xcite , grb 031203/sn 2003lw @xcite , and grb 060218/sn 2006aj @xcite .",
    "all of the four sne are among a special class of type ic , called the broad - lined sne indicative of a very large expansion velocity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "all the above four grbs are nearby grbs , among which grb 030329 is the farthest ( at @xmath7 ) .",
    "observing sn signatures in high - redshift grbs is difficult , since by selection effects the observable grbs at high redshift are bright and hence the underlying sne are easily overshone by the grb afterglows . despite this challenge ,",
    "a handful of grbs have shown rebrightening and flattening in their late optical afterglows , which can be interpreted as the emergence of the underlying sn lightcurves @xcite .",
    "a systematic study on the grb afterglows with this approach suggests that all long - duration grbs are associated with sne @xcite .",
    "however , exceptions to the grb - sn connection exist .",
    "extensive observations of two nearby long grbs , 060614 at @xmath8 and 060505 at @xmath9 , had not detected sne associated with them down to limits fainter than any sn ic ever observed @xcite .",
    "this has been considered to be a challenge to the standard grb classification scheme based on burst durations @xcite .    on the other hand , whether a normal ( not broad - lined ) core - collapse sn is associated with a grb or a grb - like event is uncertain .",
    "considering the fact that grbs are beamed so that many of them may have been missed by us , people have proposed to look for the grb signature in nearby sne by observing the late brightening in radio emissions of nearby sne as expected when the grb ejecta are slowed down and the radio emission becomes more or less isotropic @xcite . however , late - time radio observations of 68 local type ibc sne , including six events with broad optical absorption lines , have found none exhibiting radio emission attributable to off - axis grb jets spreading into our line of sight @xcite .",
    "this leads to a severe constraint on the fraction of sne ibc associated with normal grbs .    with the four spectroscopically confirmed pairs of grbs / sne ,",
    "a relation between the peak spectral energy of grbs and the maximum bolometric luminosity or the mass of in the ejecta of the underlying sne was derived by @xcite .",
    "a remarkable conclusion inferred from the relation was that `` if normal type ibc sne are accompanied by grbs , the grbs should be extremely underluminous in the gamma - ray band despite their close distances .",
    "their peak spectral energy is expected to be in the soft x - ray and uv band , so they may be easier to detect with an x - ray or uv detector than with a gamma - ray detector.''(li 2006 , page 1362 ) . for several sne ibc that are not as luminous as sn 1998bw , the ` expected grb ' derived from the relation has a peak spectral energy in the range of @xmath101 kev , and a total energy @xmath11@xmath12 erg in the energy band 1 - 10000 kev .",
    "it appears that xrf 080109 and sn 2008d agree with the relation ( section [ xrf ] ) .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section [ data ]",
    "the analysis of the xrt data is presented . in section [ shock ]",
    "it is argued that the x - ray transient 080109 can not be interpreted as a sn shock breakout event .",
    "section [ xrf ] shows that the most natural explanation of the nature of the transient 080109 is that it is a faint xrf with a very soft spectrum . in section [ model ] models for producing faint and soft xrfs by a normal core - collapse sn",

    "are drawn , and future observational strategies are proposed .",

    "the lightcurve has a fred ( fast rise and exponential decay ) shape and a duration @xmath13 s. although the x - ray emission was already in progress when the observation began and hence the start time of the burst is uncertain , from the shape of the lightcurve it is expected that the start time of the burst should not be too much earlier than the start time of observation ( see , e.g. , fig . 1 of soderberg et al . 2008 ) .    in extraction of the source and background",

    "( i.e. , single and double pixel events ) were selected in order to achieve better spectral resolution .",
    "a fit of the king function to the point spread function ( psf ) of the image showed that the core region with a radius of three pixels was piled up , so the core region was removed from the analysis .",
    "then the source region where the spectrum was extracted was an annular aperture with an inner radius of four pixels ( @xmath14 ) and an outer radius of 30 pixels ( @xmath15 ) , centered at the source position .",
    "the background region was defined as an annulus centered on the source with an inner radius of 60 pixels ( @xmath16 ) and an outer radius of 110 pixels ( @xmath17 ) .    in the data analysis ,",
    "channels below 0.3 kev and above 10 kev were excluded . the spectrum integrated over the 600  s time - interval",
    "was then fitted with the xspec package ( v. 11.3.1 ) , and the pile - up correction was included . to reduce the poisson noises , the spectrum data were binned to ensure that each energy bin contains at least 20 counts .",
    "the spectrum is well fitted by an absorbed power - law model , with an photon index @xmath18 and total equivalent hydrogen column density @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "the reduced chi - square of the fit is @xmath21 , with 18 degrees of freedom .",
    "these results are consistent with the analysis by @xcite .",

    "[ a figure of the power - law spectral fit is not shown here since it is very similar to the fig . 2 of soderberg et al .",

    "although the power - law fit is good , the fit of the spectrum is not unique .",
    "an interesting result is that , although an absorbed single blackbody does not fit the spectrum of xrf 080109 ( @xmath29 ) , an absorbed double blackbody model fits the spectrum equally well as the absorbed power - law ( fig .",

    ". the reduced chi - squares of the fit is @xmath33 , with @xmath34 degrees of freedom .    with this double blackbody model ,",
    "the unabsorbed total bolometric energy radiated by the burst is @xmath35 erg , with @xmath36 erg in the lower temperature component , and @xmath37 erg in the higher temperature component .",
    "i stress that the above result only indicates that a blackbody origin of the x - ray emission can not be ruled out , and it does not prove that a blackbody component exists in the x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the 080109 transient can be fitted with a power law ( section [ data ] ) .",
    "no blackbody component is required .",
    "a characteristic feature of sn shock breakout is a blackbody - like spectrum @xcite .",
    "hence , the transient event 080109 is not likely to be a sn shock breakout event .",
    "however , as shown in section [ data ] , the spectrum can be equally well fitted with a model consisting of two blackbody components ( fig .",
    "[ xrf080109_bb_bb ] ) .",
    "now let us check if one of the two blackbody components might arise from the sn shock breakout event .    from the duration of the event and the bolometric total energy of each blackbody , the average bolometric luminosity and hence the average photosphere radius of each component can be derived . for the softer component ( @xmath38 kev ) ,",
    "the radius is @xmath39 . for the harder component ( @xmath40 kev ) , the radius is @xmath41 .",
    "both are much smaller than the solar radius .",
    "the underlying sn of the event , sn 2008d , was initially classified as type ic and later reclassified as type ib @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the progenitor star should be a wolf - rayet star , which usually has a radius of several solar radii .",
    "sn shock breakout occurs at a radius near the stellar surface @xcite , or the photospheric radius if the star is surrounded by an intense stellar wind @xcite .",
    "hence , the above results on the photospheric radius of the blackbody emission indicate that neither of the two blackbody components originates from the shock breakout event .    from the derived photospheric radii ,",
    "a limit on the expansion speed of the blackbody photosphere can be estimated .",
    "assume that the average photospheric radius corresponds to a time of 100  s after the explosion .",
    "then , for the softer blackbody component , the photospheric speed @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 is the speed of light ) . for the harder blackbody component , the photospheric speed @xmath44 .",
    "these speeds are non - relativistic , contrary to the prediction that shock breakout from a compact wolf - rayet star is mildly relativistic ( with a shock breakout velocity @xmath45 , * ? ? ?",

    "the duration of the x - ray transient 080109 is @xmath46  s , which is also much longer than that predicted for shock breakout in sne ibc .",
    "hence , we conclude that the x - ray transient 080109 is not a sn shock breakout event .",
    "having shown that the x - ray transient 080109 is not a sn shock breakout event , one is left with two alternative interpretations about the nature of the transient : ( 1 ) it is a low - luminosity xrf @xcite ; ( 2 ) it is a flare in the x - ray afterglow of a grb @xcite .",
    "the transient object happened to be in the bat field of view in two previous  observations ( of bzq j0618 + 4620 beginning at 13:04:12.33 , and of sn 2007ax beginning at 13:12:24.5 ut on 9 jan 2008 ) .",
    "bat did not trigger during either of the two observations .",
    "an examination of the bat data from the direction of ngc 2770 during those observations shows no sign of emission in the bat energy range 15150 kev , with a fluence upper limit of @xmath47 erg @xmath20 in a period of half an hour before the start of observation of the transient 080109 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the uvot lightcurve of the transient closely resembles an early stage uv - optical lightcurve of a grb ( e.g. , grb 060218 ) , rather than a uv - optical afterglow lightcurve during the late declining stage .",
    "hence , the interpretation of the transient event as a flare in the x - ray afterglow of a grb is also ruled out .",
    "an additional evidence supporting an xrf interpretation of the transient 080109 is in the shape of the x - ray lightcurve after the prompt emission phase . at the end of an exponential decay",

    "similarly , for the case of grb 060218 , the shock breakout interpretation for the blackbody component in the early x - ray and uv - optical emissions @xcite is not valid because of the extremely long duration and large energy of the blackbody component @xcite as well as the inconsistence of the calculated photospheric velocity with the model ( fig .",
    "[ tembr_gsvs ] ) .    in combination with the fact that the high energy observation by the bat / has ruled out a grb x - ray flare interpretation , the above facts strongly support the claim that the x - ray transient 080109 is an xrf from a normal core - collapse supernova .",
    "the sn associated with it , sn 2008d , is a normal type ibc sn in terms of its peak luminosity and the optical spectra , in contrast to other grb - sne like sn 1998bw .",
    "adopting the peak bolometric luminosity and the mass of nickel in the ejecta of sn 2008d derived by @xcite , xrf 080109/sn 2008d is consistent with the relation between the peak spectral energy of grbs and the peak bolometric luminosity or the mass of nickel of the underlying sne proposed by @xcite .",
    "the radio observation on xrf 080109 puts it in a place in the plane of the x - ray / gamma - ray luminosity versus the radio luminosity that agrees with the overall trend of nearby grbs / sne .",
    "the very soft spectrum of xrf 080109 indicates that the fireball outflow associated with it is more or less spherical .",
    "how a spherical fireball plows through a dense environment of the sn envelope and makes a ` spherical grb ' is discussed .",
    "in addition to the model that a fraction of mass in the outer layer of the sn envelope is accelerated by the shock wave to a mildly relativistic speed which then produces a faint grb via interaction with the surrounding matter @xcite , a new scenario is proposed which assumes that the low - density fireball emerges from the sn envelope via the rayleigh - taylor instability . during its way of pushing the heavy envelope aside",
    ", the fireball loses energy and gets mass from the sn envelope .",
    "then an intrinsically faint and spectroscopically soft burst is produced by the mildly relativistic or sub - relativistic fireball via the internal / external shock interaction .",
    "the detection of an xrf in a normal core - collapse sn extends the connection between grbs / xrfs and sne .",
    "it may suggest that every type ibc ( maybe type ii also ) sn has a grb / xrf associated with it .",
    "if this is true , events like xrf 080109 would occur at a rate comparable to that of sne ibc , @xmath107 yr@xmath27 in an average galaxy @xcite .    for a normal core - collapse sn that is not as bright as sn 1998bw",
    ", it is expected that the xrf associated with it has a spectrum peaked in the uv to x - ray band and total energy of @xmath11@xmath12 erg @xcite .",
    "a wide - field soft x - ray telescope devoted to the detection of soft x - ray flares will be very fruitful in discovering these very soft xrfs .",
    "the detection of them is very important for understanding the nature of the grb - sn connection , the emission mechanism of low - luminosity xrfs , and the explosion mechanism of core - collapse sne .",
    "the design and launch of such a telescope is also important for detecting other three types of events : ( 1 ) shock breakout in sne ibc @xcite , which is the first observable electromagnetic signal from a core - collapse sn and should occur ahead of the xrf ; ( 2 ) thermal precursors of normal grbs @xcite , the detection of which will give us a chance to obtain a complete multi - wavelength observation on grbs starting from the prompt emission phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( 3 ) bright grbs at very high redshift ( @xmath108 ) whose peak spectral energy is shifted to the soft x - ray range by the cosmic redshift effect .",
    "the author thanks bin - bin zhang for help in data reduction , jinsong deng , yi - zhong fan , daniele malesani , and bing zhang for useful communications .",
    "he also thanks the referee ( elena pian ) for a very helpful report which has led to significant improvements to the presentation of the paper ."
