    "the problem of magnetoresistance in metal and semiconductor structures has been intensively discussed in literature during the past three decades . a large number of both theoretical and experimental papers on this subject was published .",
    "most of these works were devoted to the case of the degenerate two dimensional electron gas where the electrons move in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field and scatter on a random impurity potential .",
    "in this situation only the electrons with energy close to the fermi energy participate in conductance and the usual approach based on the boltzmann equation leads to vanishing magnetoresistance . in other words ,",
    "the longitudinal resistance @xmath8 of the sample does not depend on the magnetic field @xmath9 this implies that the explanation of the experimentally observed @xmath10 dependence of the longitudinal resistance should be sought beyond the boltzmann theory .    the intense exploration of this area began from the work of altshuler _ et al _",
    ", @xcite where the experimentally observed in 2d metals and semiconductor structures negative magnetoresistance ( mr ) , i.e. decreasing @xmath8 with increasing @xmath10 , was explained by quantum interference effects .",
    "it was shown that the magnetic field destroys the negative weak localization correction to the conductivity , thus resulting in decreasing longitudinal resistance .",
    "since the first publication on the subject @xcite a vast amount of work has been devoted to its further exploration ( see for review ref .  ) .",
    "two years prior to ref",
    ".   there appeared a publication @xcite where a classical mechanism of negative magnetoresistance was discussed .",
    "the mechanism was investigated on the example of a gas of non - interacting electrons scattering on hard disks ( antidots ) .",
    "it was shown that with increasing magnetic field there is an increasing number of closed electron orbits which avoid scatterers and therefore are not diffusive ( see also recent discussions @xcite of this mechanism ) .",
    "electrons occupying these orbits do not participate in diffusion . as a result",
    ", the longitudinal resistance turns out to be proportional to the factor @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the probability of the existance of the circular closed orbit , which avoids scatterers ( here @xmath1 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath2 is the scattering time ) .",
    "another classical mechanism was presented in ref .  , where the mr due to non - markovian dynamics of electrons trapped in some region of space was discussed .    notwithstanding these developments ,",
    "the role of classical effects in magnetotransport was underappreciated for a long time . a new boost to the research in this direction was given by ref .  , where it was shown that if electrons move in a smooth disorder potential and in a sufficiently strong magnetic fields a phenomenon called `` classical localization '' occurs .",
    "this phenomenon leads to the exponential suppression of the longitudinal resistance : most electrons are trapped in localized equipotential trajectories and do not participate in diffusion .",
    "this work was followed by a series of works , @xcite discussing different aspects of classical magnetotransport in 2d systems .",
    "it was shown @xcite that for lower magnetic fields near the onset of the classical localization the magnetoresistance is positive , i.e. the longitudinal resistance grows with increasing magnetic field . in refs .",
    "the combination of smooth disorder and strong scatterers ( antidots ) was considered .",
    "it was shown that in this system under certain conditions there are several regimes of the behavior of magnetoresistance depending on the strength of the magnetic field : first the longitudinal resistance decreases with growing field , then it saturates and then begins to grow .    in refs .",
    "magnetoresistance was studied in a situation where the magnetic field is classically strong , that is where the parameter @xmath13 is large .",
    "recently , the region of classically small magnetic fields @xmath14 was investigated numerically @xcite for the case of electrons scattering on strong scatterers .",
    "it was shown @xcite that memory effects due to double scattering of an electron on the same disk lead to a negative parabolic magnetoresistance ( in the ref .  , where these processes were not taken into account , exponentially small mr was predicted ) .",
    "the numerical simulations @xcite discovered a low - field classical anomaly of the mr .",
    "the anomaly was attributed to the memory effects specific for backscattering events .",
    "the simulations were performed for the 2d lorenz gas which is a system of 2d electrons scattering on hard disks randomly distributed in plane with average concentration @xmath4 magnetotransport in this system is characterized by two dimensionless parameters : @xmath15 and the gas parameter @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the disk radius , @xmath1 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath18 is the mean free time and @xmath19 is the mean free path .",
    "the anomaly was observed in the case @xmath20 both the numerical simulations and the qualitative considerations @xcite indicated that at zero temperature the mr can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless function @xmath21 via @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the resistivity for @xmath24 numerical results @xcite suggest that @xmath25 as @xmath26 yielding @xmath27 the latter expression is in a very good agreement with experimental measurements of negative linear mr in a random antidot arrays.@xcite it is anomalous in two senses .",
    "first , it has a non - analytic dependence on the magnetic field .",
    "second , it does not vanish in the limit of vanishing @xmath28 , which is normally regarded as the expansion parameter for the corrections to the drude - boltzmann picture .",
    "this intriguing behavior calls for a rigorous analytical theory of the effect , which would establish eq .   and enable one to derive the analytical expression for function @xmath29 .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed theory of the anomaly and give an expression for @xmath21 ( the brief description of our results was given in ref .  ) .",
    "we find that at some interval , @xmath30 function @xmath21 is linear in agreement with numerical simulations and experiment , but at @xmath31 crosses over to a quadratic dependence .",
    "thus , for @xmath32 eq .",
    "yields @xmath33 the limit @xmath34 should be taken with care . while the small @xmath35 expansion seems to be singular as a function of @xmath36 the region of @xmath35 where this expansion is valid shrinks as @xmath37 for @xmath38 @xmath29 saturates at some constant value .",
    "therefore , the full variation of @xmath39 is of the order @xmath40 in other words , the anomalous mr is strong but it exists in a small region of magnetic fields .",
    "the mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "is linked to the memory effects arising in backscattering events .",
    "it has a close relation to the well known non - analyticity of the virial expansion of transport coefficients , @xcite which we briefly recall . for @xmath41 the leading nonanalytic correction to resistivity , @xmath42 ,",
    "is due to the processes of return to a scatterer after a single collision on another scatterer ( see fig .  [",

    "it was shown that the probability @xmath52 is actually larger than @xmath57 indeed , the exponent @xmath58 can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 it represents the probability of the existence of an empty corridor ( free of the centers of the disk ) of width @xmath61 around the electron trajectory from @xmath62 to @xmath63 however , the passage of a particle from @xmath64 to @xmath62 ensures the absence of the disks centers in the region of width @xmath61 around this part of trajectory ( from @xmath64 to @xmath62 ) this reduces the scattering probability on the way back .",

    "for example , for @xmath45 we have @xmath67 and @xmath68 which reflects the obvious fact that the particle can not scatter , if it travels back along the same path .",
    "taking into account the effect of `` empty corridor '' , we get @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a constant of the order of unity . thus , for @xmath41 the `` empty corridor '' effect simply changes the constant in the argument of the logarithm .    the key idea suggested in ref .   was that for @xmath71 the area of the overlap of the two corridors , @xmath44 sharply depends on @xmath72 resulting in the observed mr .",
    "indeed , it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1]b that for @xmath73 @xmath74 resulting in sharp negative mr @xmath75 the following qualitative explanation of the observed linear mr was presented in ref .  .",

    "assuming that this estimate also works at @xmath80 and expanding @xmath81 to the first order in @xmath72 one gets @xmath82    in fact , the physical picture of the phenomenon is more subtle .",
    "the contribution of any trajectory with @xmath80 is cancelled to the first order in @xmath83 by the contribution of the time - reversed trajectory , since the values of @xmath84 are opposite for these paths ( see fig .",
    "1  d ,  e ) .",
    "the cancellation does not occur only at very small @xmath85 the integration in eq .   over @xmath86 yields @xmath87 .",
    "larger values of @xmath88 also give a quadratic in @xmath35 contribution to the mr .",
    "this contribution is positive and comes from the second order term in the expansion of @xmath89 in @xmath10 .",
    "it follows from our results ( see eqs .  , ) that the contribution of small angles is dominant resulting in a negative parabolic mr .",
    "we find that the parabolic mr crosses over to linear at very small @xmath90 which explains why the parabolic mr was not seen in numerical simulations @xcite and experiment .",
    "@xcite note that for very small @xmath91 contribution of the trajectories with a long lyaponov region ( lyapunov trajectories ) becomes important . in the section  [ calc ] we focus on the region @xmath92 where the contribution of the lyapunov trajectories is parametrically small .",
    "the lyapunov trajectories will be discussed in section  [ lyap ] .",
    "in this subsection we introduce the kinetic equation which is the starting point for the calculation of the diffusion coefficient and the resistivity of the lorenz gas .",

    "this leads to the following modification of the obtained formulae : one should change @xmath470 in eq .   and",
    "@xmath471 in eq .  .",
    "here over line means averaging over antidot sizes .",
    "we do not present here corresponding calculations , since the distribution function of antidot sizes is not known for experiment .",
    "@xcite    next we briefly discuss several interesting unsolved problems .",
    "note first that above consideration of lyapunov trajectories is valid , provided that @xmath472 .",
    "indeed , while calculating the @xmath247th order diagrams we neglected small contributions of @xmath177 and @xmath179 pairings on the all correlated links .",
    "accounting of such pairings is rather tricky and is out of scope of this paper .",
    "we expect , however , that such correlations may lead to a factor on the order of @xmath473 (  @xmath474 ) in eq .  .",
    "therefore , for @xmath475 the contribution of lyapunov diagrams might become @xmath180 dependent .",
    "this gives a low - field limit for our theory @xmath476 we conclude that the behavior of the mr in the limit @xmath477 remains so far unclear .    in our calculations we fully neglected quantum effects .",
    "such effects should decrease the `` effect of empty corridor '' due to the diffraction on the edges of the disks . in the situations where the magnetic field is not very small , @xmath478 , the neglecting of the diffraction effects",
    "is justified if @xmath479 ( @xmath480 is a fermi wavelength ) .",
    "this criterion ensures that diffraction effects on the edges of the disks are not relevant at the scales of the order of @xmath481 in the opposite case , @xmath482 the diffraction should destroy the `` corridor effect '' , thus suppressing the anomalous mr . for small magnetic fields ,",
    "when @xmath379 the criterion for negligibility of the diffraction becomes stronger , @xmath483 where @xmath484 is the characteristic size of the lyapunov region .",
    "another quantum effect which can be especially important from the point of view of the possible experimental realizations is the weak localization phenomena .",
    "the weak localization correction to the conductivity also has an anomalous dependence on the magnetic field . moreover , the interpretation of the memory effects in terms of small change of effective cross - section discussed in section  [ interpr ] is very close to the interpretation of weak localization phenomenon developed in ref .  .",
    "similar to discussion in section  [ interpr ] , the coherent enhancement of backscattering amplitude caused by weak localization , is accompanied by reduction of coherent scattering in other directions , the total cross - section do not change .",
    "the competition of the non - markovian and the weak localization effects might result in new interesting phenomena .",
    "the study of such competition in a system with spin - orbit interaction can be especially interesting , because , in contrast to the weak localization correction , the `` corridor effect '' is not very sensitive to spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the detailed analysis of the quantum effects is a challenging problem which will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "we did not investigate the temperature dependence of the phenomenon .",
    "this dependence is related to the scattering by phonons ( or electron - electron scattering ) neglected in our calculations .",
    "it worth noting that importance of the electron - phonon scattering is expected to increase with decreasing magnetic field .",
    "indeed , the potential of the electron - phonon interaction depends on time , therefore restricting the maximal length of a trajectory with the lyapunov region @xmath485 where @xmath486 and @xmath487 is the temperature dependent characteristic time of the electron - phonon scattering .",
    "this implies that at small magnetic fields one should replace the logarithmic factor @xmath488 , entering eq .",
    "by a temperature dependent coefficient of the order of @xmath489",
    "we propose a theory of the negative anomalous mr in a system with strong scatterers .",
    "it is shown that the anomaly in the mr arises due to suppression of `` empty corridor effect '' by magnetic field .",
    "a detailed description of different types of non - markovian correlations related to ballistic returns is presented .",
    "a method of diagrammatic expansion of the liouville equation is developed which allows us to describe analytically the effects of `` empty corridor '' on ballistic returns .",
    "the analytical expressions for anomalous mr in different intervals of magnetic fields are derived [ see eqs .  ,  ,  ,  ] .",
    "the mr at very low magnetic fields was shown to be determined by the contribution of electron trajectories having long lyapunov region .",
    "an interpretation of the memory effects in terms of small change of the effective scattering cross - section is discussed .",
    "the analytical results are shown to be in very good agreement with the numerical simulations and experiment .",
