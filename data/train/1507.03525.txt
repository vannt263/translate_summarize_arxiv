    "this paper establishes the bounds on the condition number of a sparse random matrix with independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) entries and on the probability that such matrix is singular .    for a @xmath12 real matrix @xmath8 its _ singular values _",
    "@xmath13 are the eigenvalues of @xmath14 arranged in non - increasing order .",
    "the maximum and the minimum singular values are often of particular interest , and they can be defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denotes the euclidean norm of a vector . indeed , the largest singular value @xmath18 is the operator or spectral norm of the matrix @xmath8 , and the smallest singular value @xmath19 provides a _ quantitative measure _ of the invertibility of @xmath8 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the operator norm of the @xmath12 matrix @xmath22 .",
    "another such measure is the _ condition number _ defined as @xmath23 which often serves a measure of stability of matrix algorithms in numerical linear algebra .    in this paper",
    "we obtain lower bounds on the smallest singular value of a class of _ sparse _ random matrices , and then finding appropriate upper bounds on the maximum singular value , we deduce that the condition number of such matrices are well controlled , and therefore they are well invertible ( see theorem [ thm : smallest singular + norm ] , corollary [ thm : smallest singular heavy tail ] and corollary [ thm : smallest singular ] ) .",
    "analysis of extremal singular values of random matrices of large but fixed dimensions has received a lot of interest in recent years , due its application in compressed sensing , geometric functional analysis , theoretical computer science , and other fields of science . moreover",
    ", the bounds on the extreme singular values , especially the one on the smallest singular value , play a key role in obtaining the limiting spectral distribution of various non - hermitian random matrix ensembles .",
    "for example , see @xcite .",
    "likewise , the bounds on the smallest singular value obtained here play a crucial role in establishing the _ circular law _ for sparse non - herimitian random matrices , which is derived in a companion paper @xcite ( see also remark [ rmk : circular law ] ) .",
    "the study of the smallest singular value of a random matrix was initiated back in 1940 s when von neumann and his collaborators used random matrices to test their algorithm for the inversion of large matrices , and they speculated that [ eq : jvn ] s _ ( a_n ) ~n^-1/2 , s _ ( a_n ) ~n^1/2 ( see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.8 ) ) .",
    "that is , [ eq : condition_number_conjecture ] ( a_n ) ~n . a more precise version of this conjecture appeared in @xcite .",
    "for _ gaussian _ random matrices it was proved that @xmath24 see @xcite . however , the conjecture about the smallest singular value of a general random matrix remained open for a long time .",
    "for example , the result was not known even for _ random sign _ matrix , i.e. for the matrix with i.i.d  @xmath25 symmetric random variables .",
    "the first bound in this direction was proved in @xcite for matrices with i.i.d .",
    "sub - gaussian entries . later in @xcite this was improved to prove lower bound on @xmath26 under the finiteness of the fourth moment assumption .",
    "in particular , it was shown that for every @xmath27 , there exists @xmath28 such that @xmath29 restricting to the i.i.d .",
    "sub - gaussian entries their arguments also give the following strong probability bound : [ eq : rv1_smin ] (s_(a_n ) n^-1/2 ) c + c^n , 0 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are some constants depending polynomially on the _ sub - gaussian moment _ of the entries .",
    "finally a matching upper bound was proved for sub - gaussian entries in @xcite , and improved under finite fourth moment assumption in @xcite .",
    "the necessary bounds on the largest singular value follows from @xcite for entries with finite fourth moment , and from @xcite for i.i.d .  sub - gaussian entries .",
    "this establishes - in full generality .",
    "another line of research is directed towards proving the universality of the smallest singular value under small perturbation .",
    "this is largely motivated by its application in establishing the _ circular law_. considering a random matrix of i.i.d .   entries with finite second moment tao and vu in @xcite established that for every @xmath32 there exists a @xmath33 such that [ eq : tv_smin ] (s_(a_n+m_n ) n^-c ) n^-c , where @xmath34 is a deterministic @xmath12 matrix with @xmath35 .",
    "the results described so far are only for _ dense _ matrices . however , _",
    "matrices are more abundant in statistics , neural network , financial modeling , electrical engineering , wireless communications , and in many other fields .",
    "we refer the reader to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) for other examples , and their relevant references .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask if there is an analogue of - for sparse matrices .",
    "analysis of sparse matrices is usually more challenging than its dense counterparts because of presence of a large number of zeros .",
    "litvak and rivasplata in @xcite considered a class of random sparse matrices .",
    "they imposed certain conditions on the columns and rows of those matrices which prevent a large number of zeros , and then under the finiteness of @xmath36 moments they show - hold .",
    "another way to construct sparse random matrix is to multiply each of the entries by i.i.d .",
    "bernoulli entries denoted below by  @xmath37 , where @xmath38 . for such matrices it was shown in @xcite that holds ( a similar result appeared in @xcite ) , as long as @xmath39 for some @xmath7 ( recall that @xmath40 iff @xmath41 for some @xmath42 ) . in @xcite , under a minimal moment assumption , it was also shown that @xmath43 with probability tending to @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that @xmath44 , for a large constant @xmath30 , which is weaker than the conjecture for these sparse matrices .    on the other hand",
    ", it is straightforward to check that when @xmath45 , the probability of the matrix containing a zero row is positive and bounded below uniformly in @xmath9 , thereby making it singular . thus the analogue of can not be extended beyond the @xmath46 barrier .",
    "therefore it would be interesting to check if analogue of - hold for all @xmath47 .    in our first result below",
    "we provide an affirmative answer of the above , under a suitable assumption on the maximum singular value .",
    "note that it only requires the finiteness of the fourth moment .",

    "this is motivated by its application in identifying the limiting spectral distribution of @xmath8 .",
    "it is well known that in order to establish the convergence of empirical distribution of the singular values of @xmath8 , one needs prove the convergence of the integral of @xmath60 with respect to the empirical distribution of the singular values of @xmath61 for lebesgue a.e .",
    "@xmath62 ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath63 is unbounded near @xmath64 , one must have a control on @xmath65 . however , in theorem [ thm : smallest singular + norm ] we only consider real @xmath66 .",

    "we overcome this difficulty and extend theorem [ thm : smallest singular + norm ] for complex @xmath66 .",
    "since such extension requires a significant additional work , we defer it to @xcite where it is applied to proving the circular law for such matrices .",
    "additionally , in @xcite we prove a _ local circular law_.    to obtain the necessary estimates on the spectral norm in theorem [ thm : smallest singular + norm ] , we first focus on _ heavy - tailed _ random variables , and establish the required bound when @xmath39 . for dense matrices , the finiteness of the fourth moment is sufficient ( and also necessary ) to guarantee the necessary bounds on @xmath68 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we further note that @xmath904 thus @xmath905 it therefore remains to bound @xmath906 to this end , proceeding as in the proof of theorem [ thm : smallest singular + norm ] we note that we need to bound @xmath907 and @xmath908 where @xmath909 , and @xmath910 to bound @xmath911 we again apply proposition [ p : dominated and compressible y ] for @xmath76 , use @xmath67-net argument , and union bound as before . finally to bound @xmath912 , as in the proof of theorem [ thm : smallest singular + norm ] , we decompose @xmath715 into @xmath718 and @xmath913 , where @xmath914 the infimum over @xmath718 was taken care of using proposition [ p : norm on s_l ] , which is now done by proposition [ p : norm on s_l y ] for @xmath76 together with the @xmath67-net argument , and union bound .",
