    "although at this time there is no general consensus on all the elements necessary for the operation of a solar dynamo that creates the large - scale field that we observe as solar active regions , one ingredient that is generally considered to play an important role in all the proposed scenarios ( see e.g. @xcite ) is magnetic buoyancy .",
    "it is widely believed that the strong shear in the solar tachocline can stretch existing poloidal magnetic field into strong toroidal magnetic field , and then magnetic buoyancy instabilities of the toroidal field create compact toroidal magnetic structures that rise into the overlaying convection zone to either be re - processed there or to emerge at the solar surface as active regions .",
    "it is thus of considerable interest to seek to understand the formation and evolution of such magnetic structures . until fairly recently",
    ", such investigations have principally focussed on the evolution of pre - conceived , idealised buoyant structures ( e.g.   @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently attention turned to the problem of the self - consistent generation of such structures as well as their evolution , in particular using the dynamics that are expected to be available in the solar tachocline , i.e.  strong velocity shear ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . for different configurations of shear and seed poloidal magnetic field ,",
    "the creation of buoyantly - unstable magnetic layers that generate rising compact magnetic structures can be possible .",
    "however , as was demonstrated in @xcite and @xcite , for the case of an initial vertical ( radial ) poloidal field , the mere existence of a strong velocity shear does not guarantee the formation of a buoyant structures , as is often assumed in discussions of the large - scale solar dynamo .",
    "the instability will only occur for certain values of the parameters of the problem .",
    "of particular importance are the strength and geometry of the shear flow as related to the background stratification via a richardson number . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that sufficiently strong shear forcing could lead to the generation of buoyant magnetic structures .",
    "however , the forcings required were extreme and unphysical for the context of the solar tachocline .",
    "whilst attempting an analytical understanding of this problem , @xcite outlined the possibility that the stabilizing effect of stratification could be mitigated by a strong difference between the stabilizing thermal diffusion time and the destabilizing magnetic diffusion time , as had been noted earlier @xcite for the simpler problem of the instability of a steady stratified horizontal magnetic field . when the ratio of these diffusivities @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath2 is the thermal diffusivity ) is small , instability may occur for more reasonable shear rates , via a double - diffusive instability mechanism .",
    "this possibility was explored using numerical simulations in @xcite .",
    "this paper provided clear evidence for the existence of the double diffusive magnetic buoyancy in the configuration of @xcite for physically - realizable forcings , and showed that the onset of this instability is quasi two - dimensional in nature , in agreement with the previous linear stability calculations of @xcite .",
    "however , the purpose of @xcite was to establish the existence of the instability . here",
    ", we wish to examine the subsequent non - linear evolution of such an instability .",
    "after substantial further computation , we present the results of the evolution of case  1 from @xcite until the point where interactions with the boundaries of the computational domain invalidate further exploration .",
    "the basic set up for this model is similar to that of several previous studies of magnetic buoyancy in a fully compressible plane layer ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) and exactly the same as that described in @xcite .",
    "the standard equations for compressible fluid dynamics in dimensionless form ( see e.g.   @xcite ) are augmented with a forcing term that ensures the maintenance of a desired target shear flow against viscous decay in the absence of magnetic effects . the chosen target shear flow here ( as in @xcite )",
    "is of the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 a hyperbolic tangent function , selected to be representative of the smooth radial shear transition believed to exist in the solar tachocline .",
    "initially , we impose a weak uniform vertical magnetic field and examine the action of the shear on this seed field .",
    "the problem is defined by a number of dimensionless quantities that appear in the governing equations and here we once again set these to be the values for case 1 in @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , with aspect ratio for the computational domain 2:1:1 so that the domain is elongated in the direction of the shear flow .",
    "the computation is performed by standard pseudospectral methods and was run on over 200 cores of a machine composed of 2ghz dual - core opteron 270 processors for a few months .",
    "in order to investigate the full nonlinear evolution of a double diffusive magnetic buoyancy instability we evolve case 1 from @xcite until there is significant interaction with the upper boundary and the computation has to be halted .",
    "this occurs at @xmath11 in our dimensionless units .",
    "three - dimensionality : : :    figure [ figure1 ] shows volume renderings of the vertical component of    velocity at a series of times that range from a short while after the    onset of the instability to shortly before the run was terminated .",
    "existence of a vertical velocity shows evidence of a mode of motion    that is not driven by the forcing but which must spontaneously arise    as an instability .",
    "as described in @xcite , initially the instability    appears as a wavelike perturbation with high frequency in the    cross - stream @xmath12 direction , with some but little variation    in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "these quasi two - dimensional rolls of    motion aligned in the downstream direction are suggestive of the    fastest growing modes that might be expected from the linear stability    of a simple plane layer of magnetic field in a velocity shear    ( @xcite ) . as time advances , the region of instability increases in    size , extending upwards towards the top of the computational domain .",
    "it appears as though the strongest motions are occurring towards the    top of this expanding region , but that action continues behind even    after the peak of activity has passed on .",
    "+     horizontally - averaged    as a function of depth at various times , showing the evolution of    two - dimensional disturbances .",
    "bottom panel _ )    @xmath14 horizontally - averaged    as a function of depth at various times , showing the evolution of    three - dimensional disturbances.,title=\"fig:\",width=377,height=302 ]     horizontally - averaged    as a function of depth at various times , showing the evolution of    two - dimensional disturbances .",
    "bottom panel _ )    @xmath14 horizontally - averaged    as a function of depth at various times , showing the evolution of    three - dimensional disturbances.,title=\"fig:\",width=377,height=302 ]    +    it also appears as though motions become more three dimensional as    time progresses . to check this out ,",
    "we examine the quantities shown in    figures [ figure2 ] .",
    "initially , there is only a vertical magnetic field    present .",
    "the action of the forced velocity profile is to draw out this    initial field to induce a horizontal component in the region of shear .    eventually the gradients induced are sufficient for the    double - diffusion magnetic buoyancy instability to occur . during the    stretching phase",
    ", there are only two components of the magnetic field ,    the initial @xmath15 and the induced @xmath16 .",
    "when    instability occurs , perturbations to all components of    @xmath17 may be present .",
    "if the instability is    two - dimensional , we expect to see a signature of the perturbation to    @xmath16 in the @xmath12 direction with little    perturbation in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "if three - dimensional    motions appear , we expect to see a signature of the perturbation to    @xmath16 in the @xmath13 direction too .",
    "we therefore    examine @xmath18 and    @xmath19 as measures of the existence    of two- and three - dimensional perturbations . from figure [ figure2]a ,",
    "clearly the strongest two - dimensional perturbation grow with time , and    appear at the top of the expanding region of activity , as was seen    visually in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "two - dimensional perturbations exist in    the whole region , but are twice as strong near the top . from figure    [ figure2]b",
    ", three - dimensional perturbations appear to exist more    homogeneously throughout the activity region .",
    "these perturbations    exist for all times , but their measure is at least two orders of    magnitude weaker than that of the two - dimensional perturbations .",
    "however , the relative strength of the three - dimensional measure does    appear to increase approximately four - fold over time , whilst remaining    substantially weaker overall , confirming our visual inspection of    figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "+     the depth of the unstable region : : :    the point where the maximum activity is obtained moves towards the    upper boundary .",
    "this appears to be a consequence of the underlying    evolution of the induced @xmath16 field .",
    "the shear induction    of @xmath16 produces an increasing peak of @xmath16    which leads to a rising `` front '' in the vertical gradient of    @xmath16 , on which the instability appears to `` surf '' .",
    "this    evolving peak can be seen as the short dot - dashed line in panels of    figure  [ figure3 ] .",
    "instability continues behind this front but appears    to be strongest where the front is passing through .",
    "eventually this    front hits the upper boundary and at this point we can no longer    continue the simulation .",
    "the problem under consideration therefore has    the character of a dynamic bifurcation , where the background state    that determines the linear instability is evolving with time .",
    "the    timescale for the development of the basic horizontal field structure    here appears to be comparable with the growth rate of the    @xmath12-dependent disturbances , somewhat complicating matters .",
    "nonetheless it is to be expected that the disturbance will grow    principally in regions where the background state is locally unstable .    from linear stability arguments ( @xcite )",
    ", we expect the    fastest growing modes to have high cross - stream wavemnumber    ( @xmath20 ) and a downstream wavenumber ( @xmath21 )    that is as long as possible  quasi interchange modes .",
    "we therefore    here compare the extent of the instability found in our simulations    with both the local two - dimensional interchange and three - dimensional    criteria which would hold for a non - evolving stationary field    configuration .",
    "these can be written , in a simplified form as    +    @xmath22 @xmath23    +    ( see e.g. @xcite for further details ) . note that the right hand side    of both inequalities is the same .",
    "figure [ figure3 ] shows the regions    where these inequalities are satisfied , namely where the lines    corresponding to relevant field gradient criteria ( left hand sides    above ) lie above the dotted line giving the stabilizing entropy    gradient ( right hand sides above ) .",
    "initially , there is considerable    overlap between the regions were both the two and three dimensional    instability criteria are met , and as expected , the three - dimensional    instability is slightly preferred . however , at later times we see that    the region where the two dimensional instability criterion is met is    confined to a very small region at the top of the expanding region . by    contrast the region where the three dimensional instability criterion    is satisfied occupies almost half the depth of the box at late times .",
    "the figure also shows the region where @xmath24(averaged in    @xmath25 ) is significant ( formally greater than    @xmath26 ) to indicate the vertical extent of    activity at each time .",
    "it can be seen that this expands reasonably in    line with the extending region of ( static ) three - dimensional    instability , and occupies at any time basically the whole region where    there is significant positive gradient in @xmath27 since    the stabilising entropy gradient is so low .",
    "from this simple analysis , one might hesitantly conclude that our initial visual impression is correct .",
    "initially , the instability does appear to be dominated by quasi two - dimensional modes , although formally both ( stationary not dynamic ) instability criteria ( for interchange and three - dimensional modes ) are satisfied .",
    "the variation in @xmath12 of the instability is on a rather shorter scale than that appearing for larger values of the diffusivity ratio , as shown in the results of @xcite .",
    "this short transverse scale is reminiscent of the salt finger instability that occurs in the oceans when warm salty water overlies cold fresh water .",
    "as the simulation progresses , the evolving region of the background field that provides the magnetic gradients to drive the instability dynamically creates a shifting and adjusting region of local instability .",
    "the strongest instability occurs at the top of this region , and appears to still have a strong quasi two - dimensional component , whereas the motions in the wake of this front appear to be more likely dominated by a variety of unstable three - dimensional modes as the pure interchange modes become damped .",
    "overall , the region of instability broadens .",
    "considerably more work is required in order to understand fully the evolution of this instability .",
    "taller boxes or domains that adjust to allow the rising front of activity are required for a complete picture of the long time evolution and saturation of this process .",
    "the efficiency of this process in its transport of magnetic field is of primary interest in the solar context and is worthy of further study .",
