    "we deal in this paper with the hadamard fractional derivative , introduced in @xcite .",
    "recently , it has call the attention of researchers and numerous results have appeared , with an extensive study of properties of such kind of operators @xcite . for recent results we suggest @xcite .    due the complexity of solving equations involving fractional operators , in most cases is impossible to determine the exact solution and",
    "so numerical methods are used to determine an approximated solution of the problem .",
    "this is an emerging field , and we can find already in the literature several methods to deal with these problems , at least for the most common fractional derivative types . for the hadamard fractional derivative , we mention the recent paper @xcite , where the fractional operator is replaced by a finite sum involving only integer - order derivatives of the function . replacing the fractional derivative by this sum , we rewrite the initial problem in terms of integer - order derivatives and thus we are able to apply classical known methods . in @xcite",
    "another approximation formula is obtained , using also integer - order derivatives only .",
    "the disadvantage is that in order to have a good approximation , we need to use higher - order derivatives , which may not be adequate for fractional problems . in this paper",
    "we follow a different path , by discretizing the fractional derivative , and then convert continuous problems into discrete ones .    to start ,",

    "@xcite ) @xmath9 and @xmath10    more properties can be found in references at the end .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we present the main result of the paper . starting with the definition , and with an appropriate grid on time , we present a new discrete version for the left hadamard fractional derivative . to show the efficiency of the method , in section [ sec : example ] we compare the exact expression of a fractional derivative with some numerical experiments , for different values of @xmath4 and different step sizes @xmath11 .",
