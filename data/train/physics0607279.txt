    "the phenomena of reflection and refraction of light at the interface of two transparent media are widely used for steering light in many optical devices",
    ". there has been much discussion on realizations of omnidirectional total reflection  @xcite . while the omnidirectional total transmission , where wave is completely transmitted for arbitrary incident directions , attracted little attention .",
    "recently , the omnidirectional total refraction at the planar interface associated with convention nonmagnetic uniaxial crystal have been studied  @xcite .",
    "the advent of a new class of anisotropic dielectric - magnetic metamaterial with negative permittivity and permeability has attained considerable attention  @xcite .",
    "@xcite have extended that anomalous negative refraction can occur at the interface associated with an anisotropic dielectric - magnetic metamaterial , which does not necessarily require that all tensor elements of permittivity @xmath0 and permeability @xmath1 have negative values .",
    "the study of such anisotropic metamaterial have recently received much interest and attention  @xcite .",
    "the question thus naturally arises : whether there exists any type of interface associated the anisotropic dielectric - magnetic material support the omnidirectional total transmission . in the present work , we present an investigation on the omnidirectional total transmission from vacuum into anisotropic dielectric - magnetic metamaterial .",
    "we find that the omnidirectional total transmission need not limit at the interface associated with conventional nonmagnetic uniaxial crystal .",
    "we want to explore how the omnidirectional total transmission shows up at microscopic leave .",
    "in molecular optics theory , a bulk material can be regarded as a collection of molecules ( or atoms ) embedded in the vacuum . under the action of an incident field , the molecules oscillate as electric and magnetic dipoles and emit radiations .",
    "the radiation field and the incident field interact to form the new transmitted field in the material and the reflection field outside the material  @xcite .",
    "let us carry this idea one step further : the metamaterial is structured into subunits . in the case of electromagnetic radiation",
    "this usually means that the subunits must be much smaller than the wavelength of radiation .",
    "then the unit cells of metamaterials can be modelled as the molecules ( or atoms ) in ordinary materials .    for anisotropic metamaterials one or both of the permittivity and permeability are second - rank tensors .",
    "to simplify the proceeding analysis , we assume the permittivity and permeability tensors are simultaneously diagonalizable : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the permittivity and permeability constants , respectively .",
    "we choose the @xmath5 axis to be normal to the interface , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 axes locate at the plane of the interface .",
    "let us consider a monochromatic electromagnetic field @xmath8 $ ] incident from vacuum into the anisotropic metamaterial .",
    "the reflected and transmitted fields can be express as @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 $ ] , respectively .",
    "the incident angle is given by @xmath11 $ ] , and the refractive angle of the transmitted wave vectors is decided by @xmath12 $ ] . for compactness ,",
    "let us first explore the e - polarized incident waves .",
    "schematic diagram for how the reflected and transmitted fields of e - polarized waves are generated by the incident field and radiated fields of dipoles . in the vacuum , the reflected field @xmath13 , while the transmitted field @xmath14 in the anisotropic metamaterial.,width=453 ]    following the ewald - oseen extinction theorem , the total radiated field @xmath15 is the sum of the contribution from all electric dipoles @xmath16 and that from all magnetic dipoles @xmath17 . while the incident field is assumed to permeate to the medium without being affected by the interface and the properties of that medium  @xcite .",
    "hence the reflected field in vacuum ( @xmath18 ) can be expressed in the terms of the collective operations of the electric and magnetic responses : @xmath19 while the transmitted field is the superstition of the incident field and all the radiated field induced by the dipoles : @xmath20 in the other words , the re - emission of the electric and magnetic dipoles to the half of the space ( @xmath21 ) extinguishes the incident field and produces the transmitted field .    the electric fields radiated by electric dipoles and magnetic dipoles are respectively decided by @xcite @xmath22 here @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the hertz vectors , @xmath25 @xmath26 is the dipole moment density of electric dipoles and @xmath27 is that of magnetic dipoles , which are related to the transmitted fields by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where the electric susceptibility @xmath30 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath31 .",

    "here we have used the faraday s law @xmath38 which can also be established by the molecular theory .",
    "the contributions from the electric and magnetic dipoles form the reflected field @xmath39 . applying eqs .",
    "( [ pied ] ) and ( [ pimd ] ) for @xmath40 to eqs .",

    "note that the polarized incident wave exhibit a brewster angle when @xmath51 .,width=453 ]    next , let us review the transmission in isotropic nonmagnetic media .",
    "in classical electrodynamics , a simple generalization shows that the zero flection exists occurs when h - polarized waves incident from vacuum into an isotropic nonmagnetic medium ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the total transmission takes place at an incident angle satisfying @xmath53 .",
    "such an angle , determined by @xmath54 $ ] , is called the brewster angle  @xcite .",
    "the ewald - oseen extinction theorem allow us to investigate how the brewster angle generates . from the point of view of molecular optics ,",
    "we know that the radiated fields would never occur along the axes of electric and magnetic dipoles .",
    "the inherent physics for brewster angle in isotropic nonmagnetic media is that the axes of electric dipoles align with the direction of the reflected wave . while in the anisotropic dielectric - magnetic material",
    ", the physics origins are significantly different .",
    "the brewster angle occurs when the magnitudes of @xmath16 and @xmath55 are equal . setting @xmath56 in eq .",

    "it can be seen from the fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) that @xmath58 when we choose @xmath59 .",
    "it means only the induced the magnetic dipoles contribute to the reflected field . in this special case , the condition for brewster angle requires that the axes of magnetic dipoles align with the direction of the reflected wave .",

    "when @xmath60 is satisfied , e - polarized incident wave exhibits a brewster angle .",
    "from the point of view of molecular optics , the microscopic interpretation of the omnidirectional total transmission lies in the cancellation of two extremely large fields radiated by different types of induced dipoles : @xmath61 an alternative view is that the re - emission of the electric and magnetic dipoles induced by incident field cancel out in vacuum . to some extent",
