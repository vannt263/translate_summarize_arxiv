    "development of new astronomical facilities provides high resolution and sensitivity thus allowing one to reach the scales where the general relativity effects can be tested .",
    "there is already compelling evidence that active galaxies host super massive black holes ( smbh ) reaching up to @xmath0 solar masses .",
    "the central active nuclei are associated with the relativistic jets which originate near the central nuclei and move out with relativistic speeds exceeding @xmath1 .",
    "the jet plasma radiates strong synchrotron radio emission which is detectable on parsec - scales by very large baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) . here",
    ", we consider the flux - density variation of the jet plasma due to the gr effect , and the possibility of its detection by present and future radio - astronomical facilities .",
    "suppose that the jet plasma component radiating a power law spectrum @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the spectral index ) moves in the gravitational field of smbh with a speed @xmath4 in a direction with an angle @xmath5 to the line of sight of the observer .",
    "then the observed flux at a time @xmath6 depends on the doppler factor @xmath7 of the component and the distance of the component from the smbh at @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the schwarzschild radius of the smbh and its redshift .",
    "the detected flux density may vary as a result of deceleration or acceleration of the jet component , bending of the jet and intrinsic or extrinsic variability of radio emission . to investigate the pure effect of the gr on the flux density variation , we assume , that the @xmath12 and @xmath13 remain unchangeable in time . at a fixed frequency @xmath14",

    "seven millimeter vlbi ( 43 ghz ) can achieve an angular resolution of @xmath19as corresponding to a spatial resolution of @xmath20 for m87 ( @xmath21 mpc , for a flat cosmology with @xmath22 km s@xmath23mpc@xmath23 ) , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 pc ) ] .",

    "a global vlbi array enhanced by the ska will allow one to study the nearest weak agn which previously were unreachable by vlbi due to their faintness .",
    "the next generation space - vlbi mission vsop-2 will achieve the highest resolution of 38 @xmath29as at 43 ghz , which is twice as high ( @xmath30 for m87 ) as the resolution of a present mm - vlbi .",
    "the resolution of a global sub - mm - vlbi@xmath26 at 230 ghz will be @xmath31as which is comparable with the resolution of future space - vlbi missions .",
    "the global sub - mm - vlbi combined with alma can achieve the unprecedented angular resolution of @xmath32as ( @xmath33 for m87 ! ) allowing the gravitational effects to be tested in the vicinity of smbh thus providing additional test for the theory of general relativity and a new method for measuring the masses of smbh .",
