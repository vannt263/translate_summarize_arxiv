    "the quantum zeno blockade exploits the strong second - order nonlinear ( @xmath0 ) effects offered by an air - suspended microdisk cavity nanofabricated on a z - cut lnoi ; see figure 1 ( a ) .",
    "the fabrication procedure is described in detail in the methods section . for this application ,",
    "a major challenge is to attain phase matching for the disparate wavelengths across the telecom c - band and near - visible band . to this end",
    ", we utilize both the strong birefringence of lithium niobate and the geometric dispersion of the strongly confined wgm s in the lnoi microdisk to offset the large chromatic dispersion over an octave . for the former ,",
    "we use quasi transverse - electric ( te ) modes for the telecom light waves and quasi transverse - magnetic ( tm ) modes for the near visible light . for the latter ,",
    "we start with a 500-nm thick lnoi thin film and etch it down to only 200 nm using an inductively coupled plasma ( icp ) system . by such , we achieve phase matching for the second - harmonic generation between light waves near 1550 nm and 775 nm , all in the fundamental spatial modes along the cross section .",
    "figure 1 ( b ) shows an example of such phase - matched modes based on a finite element method ( fem ) analysis , which is verified in our experiment .",
    "the fact the two modes correspond to alike optical fields , each strongly confined to sub wavelength and singly peaked , leads to strong mode overlapping and thus offers a superior nonlinear coupling efficiency between the modes @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage with the current use of the birefringence , however , is that for the z - cut crystal orientation , the @xmath0 processes are through the @xmath1 and @xmath2 tensor elements , which are 4 to 5 times lower than the largest element @xmath3 for the lithium niobate .",
    "we expect to overcome this deficiency by applying centric periodic poling @xcite to the wg cavity for the future work . finally , to spectrally align the cavity modes",
    ", we choose the microdisk radius to be around 20 @xmath4 m .",
    "for the on / off chip light coupling , we use a piece of tapered fiber as an evanescent coupler with the microdisk , as shown in fig .",
    "the fiber is tapered down to a sub - micron diameter from a piece of standard single - mode fiber ( smf-28 ) using a home - built fiber - tapering system incorporating flame brushing @xcite .",
    "the transmission loss can be as low as 0.05 db upon tapering , but can increase to around 1 db after extended exposure in dusty air .",
    "the coupling efficiency of the tapered fiber and the microdisk is sensitive to the relative position between them , for which we use a three - axis piezo positioning system to achieve a submicron tuning resolution .    to characterize the cavity resonances",
    ", we use an optical spectrum analyzer ( osa ) to measure the transmission of a broadband light generated by the amplified spontaneous emission ( ase ) of an erbium - doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) . a typical spectrum for a 20-um radiu microdisk",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , where the free spectral range ( fsr ) is 9.1 nm near 1546 nm , and the narrowest cavity linewidth is about 0.06 nm , which corresponds to a loaded cavity quality factor of 2.6@xmath5 , as shown in the same figure .    to examine the phase matching",
    ", we measure the second - harmonic generation ( shg ) in the microdisk by coupling a sub - miliwatt of continuous - wave ( cw ) pump light into a fundamental quasi - te mode around 1546 nm .",
    "the generated second - harmonic light ( around 773 nm ) is coupled out of the microdisk through the same tapered fiber and measured in the osa .",
    "its power as a function of the input pump power is shown in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) , where a quadratic dependency is seen , thus verifying the frequency doubling process . also shown in the figure inset is a micrograph of the generated sh light scattered off the microdisk .",
    "once the shg is optimized , we switch to sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) between cw pump and cw signal waves to further optimize phase matching .",
    "it turns out that the strongest sfg occurs between two adjacent fundamental quasi - te modes , each at 1536.790 nm and 1545.900 nm . for these cw light waves , however",
    ", the cavity resonances can thermally drift by as high as 0.1 nm , which exceeds their linewidth . in order to mitigate this thermal effect",
    ", we develop an optimization method for stabilizing the sfg , as described in the methods section .",
    "once efficient sfg is observed and thermally stabilized , we quickly switch to a quasi - cw signal and a pulsed pump while retaining their wavelengths , in order to obtain high peak power for strong sfg while maintaining a low average beam power ( @xmath6 250 @xmath4w ) to minimize thermal effect .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "3 . the pump is a 1 mhz pulse train with 250-ps pulse in full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , created by modulating a cw laser using two consecutive electro - optical modulators ( eom s ) . to achieve the high pump peak power ( @xmath6 1 w ) , the output of the first eom",
    "is amplified in a two - stage edfa system .",
    "the amplified pulses are then picked by the second eom to further reduce the repetition rate thus the pump average power .",
    "as sfg is polarization dependent , an additional free - space polarization filtering system is placed into channel 1 , as shown in fig .",
    "the quasi - cw signal is synchronized and temporally aligned with the pump but a much wider pulse width ( @xmath610 ns fwhm ) .",
    "the average ( peak ) power coupled into the disk is approximately 170 @xmath4w ( 680 mw ) for the pump , and 4 @xmath4w ( 400 @xmath4w ) for the signal . to account for a slight temperature change in the disk as we swap the cw with pulsed lights , we fine tune the wavelengths of the pump and signal by less than 0.05 nm so that they hit their respective resonance centers .",
    "once good phase matching is achieved , the signal pulse overlapping a pump pulse will be deflected from the cavity via qzb , as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) . the highest modulation extinction  defined as the ratio between the qzb - induced reduction in the transmission loss to the loss when the signal is at the cavity - resonance center without qzb  is 51.0% , obtained when the signal is blue detuned from its resonance center by 0.01 nm",
    "according to our simulation , this shifted optimal signal wavelength is likely due to the imperfect phase mismatching , where the generated sf light is slightly off a resonance center .",
    "further blue detuning the signal reduces the extinction ratio to less than 16.3% .",
    "in contrast , when the signal is red detuned , its depletion through the disk is enhanced by the pump , as shown in fig .",
    "these results show that the sfg driven by the pump effectively shifts the signal s cavity resonance to shorter wavelength , consistent with the eit effect for a two - level atom @xcite .",
    "while similar resonance altering can be produced by thermal effects , here the shift applies to a single resonant line satisfying the phase matching condition for sfg , in contrast to the thermal control where all lines are affected @xcite .",
    "next , we examine qzb for pulsed operations . in order to switch the entire signal pulses",
    ", we use the same pump ( 250 ps fwhm ) but narrower signal pulses with 200 ps fwhm . furthermore ,",
    "to distinguish qzb from any thermally - induced effect , we use different pulse repetition rates for the pump ( 1 mhz ) and signal pulses ( 50 mhz ) , so that only one in every 50 signal pulses overlap with a pump pulse for qzb while the rest are unaffected . by keeping the same average power for the signal in the quasi - cw and pulsed cases ,",
    "we are able to quickly swap them without disturbing the thermal equilibrium of the microdisk .",
    "the pump and signal are temporally aligned so that the peaks of the overlapping pulses are coincident within 10 ps . to contrast the signal transmission through the disk with and without qzb",
    ", we later use a tunable optical delay with a 340 ps range to misplace the pulses .",
    "figure 5 compares the transmission of the signal pulses as they are blue detuned from the resonance center .",
    "as seen , when there is no overlap between the signal and pump pulses , about 38.1% of the input signal power is lost in the microdisk at the resonance center , which is a result of the cavity under - coupling .",
    "when the signal and pump are aligned , the lost power is reduced as the signal is qzb - deflected from the cavity .",
    "specifically , at the resonance center , the signal loss with qzb becomes 29.3% , which corresponds to a 23.0% reduction .",
    "in contrast , when the signal is blue detuned by 0.01 nm , its transmittance loss is 14.4% ( 32.8% ) with ( without ) the pump , giving a 48.2% modulation extinction by the qzb .",
    "when the signal is further blue detuned to 0.02 nm , however , the extinction decreases to 40.0% . this interesting behavior of qzb effectiveness is because the sfg is not perfectly phase matched in the current device , as suggested by our numerical simulation .",
    "all results are consistent with our measurement in the quasi - cw case .",
    "= 0 , 0.01 , 0.02 nm , respecitvely , comparing overlapping and separating with the pump.,width=480 ]",
    "we lastly assess the feasibility of our microdisk for quantum applications by measuring its in - band photon noise and modulating single photons . limited by our available filters ( so as to attain the required @xmath7100 db noise - rejection extinction ) , we select two non - adjacent fundamental quasi - te wgm s for the pump and signal , each at 1545.900 nm and 1564.750 nm .",
    "this wavelength selection unfortunately lowers the qzb efficiency by more than half as the sfg becomes less phase matched .    the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "3 , where cascaded cwdm filters are used at the input to combine the pump and the signal while rejecting the ase , and cascaded dwdm filters at the output are used to pick the signal while rejecting the pump . each dwdm filter is measured to have a 200 ghz fwhm bandwith and around 50 db extinction .",
    "the resulting photons are counted using a commercial ingaas single - photon detector ( id210 , i d quantique ) with a 8.6% quantum efficiency over 2 million trials .    in our setup",
    ", the noise photons can be created extrinsically in the fiber connecting the cascaded cwdm and dwdm via spontaneous raman scattering , as well as intrinsically in the lnoi microdisk via spontaneous raman scattering and spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) of the sh light created by the pump @xcite .",
    "to quantify the intrinsic noise falling in the signal band , we first count the noise photons from the fiber only , before it couples with the microdisk . then , we bring the fiber to the microdisk and count the photons after verifying the fiber - microdisk coupling .",
    "the results are listed in table 1 , from which the intrinsic noise is derived by comparing the photon counting with and without the microdisk .",
    "the difference in the two detector gating rates is due to the detector dead time ( 10 @xmath4s ) enforced after each photon detection to suppress the detector dark count .",
    ".measurement of photon noise . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we next demonstrate the qzb modulation of single photons by using attenuated laser pulses , each containing 0.16 photons per pulse on average .",
    "the measurement results as we blue detune the signal wavelength from the cavity resonance are shown in table 2 , where the detector dark counts and in - band noise photons created by the pump , @xmath67.12 khz , are subtracted . without qzb ,",
    "when the signal is on ( off ) resonance , the detection rate and the gating rate are 59.20 khz ( 62.88 khz ) and 465.0 khz ( 395.0 khz ) , respectively , yielding a photon probability 0.112 ( 0.1592 ) .",
    "this amounts to 29.6% transmission loss at the resonance center . with qzb",
    ", the loss is reduced . as in the previous measurements , the highest modulation extinction is 20.6@xmath80.8% when the signal wavelength is blue detuned by 0.01 nm from resonance center , which is again consistent with our preceding results using bright signal pulses .",
    "using a nonlinear nanocavity , we have demonstrated quantum zeno blockade on chip , where a light is modulated by another without they physically interacting , i.e. , overlapping in the cavity .",
    "this distinct `` interaction - free '' implementation overcomes several fundamental difficulties with nonlinear optics , such as phase distortion , raman scattering , and pulse distortion , which will otherwise prevent achieving high performance for quantum signals . as an example",
    ", we show that single photons can be modulated with little excessive noise .",
    "our results pave the way to some unvisited areas in quantum nonlinear optics , where exotic noise - free operations are promised .",
    "the next step is to increase the cavity quality factor while replacing the current fiber taper with a waveguide coupler , based on which cascaded all - optical logical operations can be integrated on a single chip .",
    "further reducing the cavity mode volume can lead to strong photon photon interaction for `` interaction - free '' quantum logic gates with high fidelity .",
    "the fabrication procedures for microdisk based on lnoi ( lithium niobate on insulator , commercially available by nanoln ) are as follow : 500 nm lithium niobate thin film is bonded on 3um silicon dioxide layer supported on lithium niobate substrate . to attain good phase matching , according to our fem simulation results , the optimum thickness of ln thin film is about 200 nm .",
    "so , after piranha cleaning and dehydration , 300 nm lithium niobate is etched away using oxford plasmalab 100 inductively coupled plasma ( icp ) system . repeating piranha cleaning and dehydration , the sample is dipped into surpass 3000 + solution ( to improve surface adhesion to resist ) prior to spinning 1000 nm thickness of e - beam resist ma - n 2410",
    ". then the sample is pre - baked and patterned using ebl ( elionix els - g100 , 100 kev ) . after development and post - bake ,",
    "the sample is dry etched to achieve 200 nm thick microdisk by argon milling process using the same icp system .",
    "boe ( buffered oxide etcher , 6:1 ) is used to undercut the microdisk to form pillar structure . the chip is diced to smaller piece for the following measurement .      to achieve locking - free yet efficient and stable sfg",
    ", we firstly use an osa to measure the transmission of a broadband light from the ase",
    ". then the resonance centers of those fundamental te polarized wg modes ( usually the narrowest linewidth ) in each fsr are selected and marked .",
    "we switch in the cw light at each resonant wavelength and continuously tune its wavelength to compensate the thermal - induced shift in cavity resonance . upon the cavity reaching its equilibrium status ,",
    "we confirm its actual resonant wavelength as well as the brightness and the mode distribution of the generated sh light .",
    "repeating the step to check all those modes , we could choose the best two modes for sum frequency generation .",
    "lastly , we couple two cw lights at the wavelengths of the selected modes and apply the same method to track the moving resonance centers .",
    "once efficient sfg is observed and thermally stabilized , we quickly switch to quasi - cw signal and pulsed pump while retaining their wavelengths ."
