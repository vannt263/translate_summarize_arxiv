    "measurements of linear polarization generally provide values for the degree and angle of polarization .",
    "they may also provide upper limits on the degree of polarization even where the nominal values @xmath0 are not much larger than the uncertainties @xmath1 ( i.e.  at low signal - to - noise ) .",
    "polarization maps typically plot vectors in regions where measurements are made with high confidence and open circles where the polarization is found to be too low to justify a vector , but where useful upper limits can still be estimated ( e.g.  where @xmath2 ; @xcite ) .    while the distributions of the polarization degree and angle are not normal ( gaussian ) , it is still possible to place estimates and uncertainties and confidence levels on their values .",
    "the position angle distribution , while non - normal , is symmetric about the measured angle so that estimates and uncertainties on its value are fairly straightforward @xcite .",
    "estimates of the polarization degree are complicated by the fact that it must always be positive , introducing a bias into any estimate . for any true polarization degree @xmath3",
    ", we expect on average to measure a polarization degree @xmath4 .",
    "this problem has been thoroughly investigated by @xcite ( @xcite ; hereafter ss85 ) .",
    "ss85 have also devised a procedure to place uncertainties on the polarization degree .",
    "first , the expected probability density of polarization (  [ sec - distrib ] ) is integrated over a set of possible measurements",
    ". however , this only places limits on the measured polarization @xmath0 , the limits varying with the value of the true polarization @xmath3 . to correct for this and thus create confidence limits on the parameter @xmath3 , ss85 project their results onto the @xmath3-axis .",
    "here we introduce a slightly different procedure for determining confidence regions on the true polarization . rather than integrate the probability density function over the data - space of the measured polarization , we integrate over the parameter - space of the true polarization .",
    "in this way we directly determine the likelihood (  [ sec - likelihood ] ) that a measured polarization @xmath0 was drawn from a source of true polarization @xmath3 .",
    "measuring the degree and angle of polarization is equivalent to determining of the amplitude and phase of a sinusoidal signal in the presence of noise .",
    "the joint and marginal probability distribution functions for the amplitude and phase have been discussed in detail by other authors @xcite . for completeness",
    "we review their results here .",
    "consider the simple case of rotating a linear polarizer through some angle @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting signal changes as @xmath6 where the amplitude @xmath0 is the polarization degree , @xmath7 a relative phase shift ( the polarization angle ) , and @xmath8 gaussian random noise .",
    "this form can be decomposed into two orthogonal components @xmath9 where @xmath10 @xmath11 is the noise component in phase with @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the noise component in phase with @xmath14 . in optics @xmath15 and @xmath16",

    "the rice distribution is near - normal with mean approaching @xmath3 and a standard deviation approaching @xmath1 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "if the true polarization @xmath3 is known , the probability that a measurement will be made in the range [ @xmath0 , @xmath23 , is given by equation ( [ eq - rice ] ) .",
