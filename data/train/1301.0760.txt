    "a semilattice is a commutative semigroup @xmath0 in which all elements @xmath1 are idempotent , i.e.  such that @xmath2 .",
    "such an @xmath3 is endowed with a natural partial order defined by @xmath4 , so that @xmath5 is the supremum of the pair @xmath6 .",
    "semilattices have been widely explored in the last decades ; a key result of the theory is the `` fundamental theorem of compact semilattices '' , which identifies the category of complete continuous semilattices with that of compact topological semilattices with small semilattices .",
    "the statement is due to hofmann and stralka @xcite .",
    "lawson s contribution was decisive for its discovery ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "see also lea @xcite for an alternative proof and gierz et al .",
    "* theorem  vi-3.4 ) .",
    "this theorem draws a link between the _ algebraic _ and the _ topological _ natures of semilattices .    but semilattices can also be regarded as _ geometric _ objects , where subsemilattices are treated as convex subsets . surprisingly , this point of view has been hardly considered in the literature .",
    "exceptions are the work of jamison ( @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) , @xcite ) cited by van de vel ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and a comment by gierz et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one reason is certainly that a semilattice with a least element can be seen as a module over the idempotent semifield @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , it belongs to the more general class of modules over an idempotent semifield @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) , and it happens that these structures have been deeply studied in the framework of `` max - plus '' or `` tropical '' convexity .",
    "we have addressed these aspects in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  v ) .",
    "however , semilattices should not be reduced to a special case of modules over an idempotent semifield .",
    "indeed , the use of the set @xmath9 as a finite idempotent semifield creates unusual phenomena : for instance , a @xmath9-module of finite type is finite ; a convex subset of a @xmath9-module is not connected in general .",
    "so one should expect @xmath9-modules to have discontinuous behaviour , that one does not usually observe in modules such as @xmath10 ( over the idempotent semifield @xmath11 ) .",
    "it is also worth studying semilattices before modules , because if @xmath12 is a convex subset of an @xmath13-module @xmath14 , then the set @xmath15 \\}$ ] is a subsemilattice of the semilattice @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "this partly explains why results on semilattices shall be useful for applications to the geometry of @xmath13-modules .",
    "other convexities naturally arise on ordered structures such as partially ordered sets , semilattices and lattices . for instance , a semilattice can also be endowed with the convexity made up of its _ order - convex _ subsemilattices ; this case was notably studied by jamison @xcite and van de vel ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "see also horvath and llinares ciscar @xcite and nguyen the vinh @xcite for investigations on path - connected topological semilattices .    for this series of convexity structures , we prove analogues of classical results of convex analysis such as the krein  milman theorem ( krein and milman @xcite , see also bourbaki @xcite ) and milman s converse @xcite . for semilattices equipped with the convexity of subsemilattices ,",
    "our main result is the following :    [ thm : klee0 ] let @xmath3 be a locally convex topological semilattice . then every locally compact , weakly - closed , convex subset of @xmath3 containing no line is the weakly - closed convex hull of its extreme points .",
    "local convexity here is another way to say that @xmath3 has _ small semilattices _ in the sense of lawson @xcite .",
    "the concept of _ line _ , which is intuitive in classical analysis , needs to be properly defined in this non - linear context .",
    "the _ weak topology _ refers to the topology generated by the family of continuous semilattice - morphisms from @xmath3 to @xmath17 $ ] . because of the fundamental theorem of compact semilattices , our proofs directly or indirecly use methods and elements from domain theory .",
    "numerous krein ",
    "milman theorems have been proved in the literature .",
    "yet they do not enable one to deduce directly the above theorem .",
    "for instance fan ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  3 ) gave a set - theoretic definition of an _ extremality _ , a concept close to the notion of _ face _ in classical analysis ; then he used it to prove an abstract krein  milman type theorem ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  iv-2.6 ) ) .",
    "however , his definition and adds - on by others such as lassak @xcite remain driven by classical convexity theory , where addition is a _ cancellative _ binary relation ; it does not work in an idempotent setting .",
    "another result of this kind is due to wieczorek @xcite .",
    "it requires two conditions : that every singleton be convex , and that the family of upper - semicontinuous _ strictly convex _ real - valued maps separate convex closed subsets and points ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* topic  iv-2.30 ) )",
    ". however , for ordered structures , the former condition may not be satisfied ( we shall see examples such as the upper convexity on a poset , or the ideal convexity on a semilattice ) , and the latter seems too complex for practical verification .",
    "we also examine the case of topological semilattices with finite _ breadth _",
    "@xmath18 , that happen to be always locally convex .",
    "jamison ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paragraph  4.d ) remarked that breadth coincides with the carathodory number associated with the convexity of subsemilattices .",
    "we prove a minkowski type theorem , which asserts that under appropriate hypothesis every point is the join of at most @xmath18 extreme points .",
    "the _ depth _ of the semilattice also coincides with an interesting convexity invariant , namely the helly number , and we establish links between depth and the number of extreme points of a compact convex subset .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : convth ] gives basics of abstract convexity theory . in section  [ sec : or ] we recall wallace s lemma on the existence of minimal elements in compact partially ordered sets , which will reveal its importance for the existence of extreme points in compact ordered structures .",
    "we also show a krein  milman type theorem in partially ordered sets .",
    "section  [ sec : convsemilat ] introduces the main convexity examined in this work , which is the convexity made up of the subsemilattices of a semilattice .",
    "we prove that a krein  milman type theorem also holds , and see that it essentially comes from the result that coirreducible elements are order - generating in continuous semilattices .",
    "an analogous form of bauer s principle is also proved .",
    "section  [ sec : convsemilat2 ] goes one step further : after the work of klee in classical convex analysis , we prove that the krein ",
    "milman theorem holds for locally compact weakly - closed convex subsets containing no line , with an adequate definition of line in topological semilattices .",
    "also , milman s converse is proved .",
    "topological semilattices with finite breadth or with finite depth are considered in section  [ sec : fb ] .",
    "we recall that the breadth and the carathodory number of a semilattice coincide , and we prove a minkowski type theorem . other convexities on semilattices and lattices are proposed in section  [ sec : cg ] .",
    "we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for these convexities to be convex geometries , which is a minimal requirement for krein  milman type theorems .",
