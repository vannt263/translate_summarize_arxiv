    "gravitational lensing can be used to map the detailed distribution of matter in the universe over a range of scales ( gunn 1967 ) .",
    "systematic distortions in the shapes and orientations of high redshift background galaxies ( weak lensing ) induced by mass inhomogeneities along the line of sight can be measured statistically ( gunn 1967 ; blandford et al .",
    "1991 ; miralda - escude 1991 ; kaiser 1992 ; see a recent review by bartelmann & schneider 1999 ) .",
    "the lensing effect depends only on the projected surface mass density and is independent of the luminosity or the dynamical state of the mass distribution .",
    "thus , this technique can potentially provide invaluable constraints on the distribution of matter in the universe and the underlying cosmological model ( bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier 1997 ) .",
    "there has been considerable progress in theoretical calculations of the effects of weak lensing by large - scale structure , both analytically and using ray - tracing through cosmological n - body simulations ( kaiser 1992 ; bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier 1997 ; jain & seljak 1997 ; jain , seljak & white 2000 ) .",
    "recently , several teams have also reported observational detections of ` cosmic shear '  weak lensing on scales ranging from an arc - minute to ten arc - minutes ( see fig . 1 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "2000 ; bacon , refregier & ellis 2000 ; wittman et al .",
    "2000 ; kaiser , wilson & luppino 2000 ) .",
    "at present , these studies are limited by observational effects , such as shot noise due to the finite number of galaxies and the accuracy with which shapes can actually be measured given the optics and seeing ( kaiser 1995 ; bartelmann & schneider 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of galaxies and their redshift distribution is still somewhat uncertain .",
    "these observational difficulties can be potentially overcome with more data .",
    "however , an important theoretical issue remains . in modeling the distortion produced by lensing",
    ", it is assumed that the _ a priori _ intrinsic correlations in the shapes and orientations of background galaxies are negligible .",
    "correlations in the intrinsic ellipticities of neighboring galaxies are expected to arise from the galaxy formation process , for example as a consequence of correlations between the angular momenta of galaxies when they assemble .",
    "the strength of these correlations can be computed in linear theory , in the context of gaussian initial fluctuations .",
    "we briefly outline the calculation here , details can be found in the following two papers crittenden et al .",
    "( 2001a ) and crittenden et al .",
    "( 2001b ) . to estimate the strength of intrinsic ellipticity correlations , we approximate the projected shape of a galaxy on the sky by an ellipsoid with semi - axes @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the orientation of the ellipsoid is given by the angle @xmath9 between the major axis and the chosen coordinate system , while its magnitude is given by @xmath10 .",
    "both the magnitude of the ellipticity and its orientation can be concisely described by the complex quantity @xmath11 , @xmath12.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath13 denotes the observed shape .    in the linear regime and under the assumption of weak lensing",
    ", the lensing equation can be written as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the complex shear and @xmath16 the intrinsic shape of the source ( kochanek 1990 ; miralda - escude 1991 ) . furthermore , in the weak regime",
    ", correlations of this distortion field are @xmath17 where the @xmath18 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the first term is the contribution that arises from intrinsic shape correlations .",
    "previous analyses have focused on the third term of this expression , correlations due to weak lensing .",
    "we assume in the calculation that shape correlations arise primarily from correlations in the direction of the angular momentum vectors of neighboring galaxies .",
    "spiral galaxies are disk - like with the angular momentum vector perpendicular to the plane of the disk , so that angular momentum couplings will be translated into shape correlations .",
    "we will assume that for ellipticals the angular momentum vector also lies along its shortest axis on average , as it does for the spirals .",
    "however , since elliptical galaxies are intrinsically rounder , the correlation amplitude will be smaller .",
    "we use the observed ellipticity distributions of each morphological type ( from the apm survey ) in the computation of the shape correlations . for weak lensing , in contrast , the induced shape correlations are independent of the original shapes of the lensed galaxies .",
    "the amplitude and shape of the computed ellipticity correlation function can be understood intuitively .",
    "the ellipticity is a function of the shear tensor , which is the second derivative of the potential . by virtue of poisson s equation ,",
    "the trace of the shear tensor is the density .",
    "therefore , we expect the correlation of the other components of the shear field will drop at the same rate as the density correlation function . since the ellipticities are quadratic in the shear field , correlations in them will fall as the density correlation function _ squared _ , @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    comparing the strength of the intrinsic correlation to that expected for weak lensing , we find that the intrinsic signal * grows * as the depth of the survey * decreases * ( the projected intrinsic shape correlation function scales as @xmath20 whereas the weak lensing correlation function scales as @xmath21 ) , because in that case galaxies close on the sky are also on average physically closer , and are hence more correlated",
    ". the weak lensing signal , on the other hand , drops off , since typically there is less matter between us and the lensed objects . for typical weak lensing surveys , however , with a median redshift of @xmath0 ,",
    "the intrinsic signal is between 1  10 per cent of the weak lensing amplitude . for shallower surveys such as sdss or 2df",
    ", the intrinsic signal may dominate the lensing one , on small scales ( see left panel of fig .",
    "1 ) . therefore ,",
    "sdss and 2df are ideally suited for studying intrinsic correlations in the orientations of galaxies .",
    "the intrinsic ellipticity depends on the square of the tidal field , whereas the lensing distortion is linear in the shear . as a direct consequence ,",
    "the distortion field is curl - free when induced by lensing , but not when intrinsic correlations are present as well ( crittenden et al",
    ". 2000b ) .",
    "angular momentum couplings produce @xmath22 and @xmath23-modes in comparable amounts and one might expect that noise , telescope distortions and other sources of systematic errors will produce curl modes as well .",
    "the detection of such magnetic   modes will be an invaluable way of separating lensing from intrinsic correlations .",
    "details on how to unambiguously do so are presented in crittenden et al .",
