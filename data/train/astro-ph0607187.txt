    "earlier on the basis of of 23-year ( 1981 - 2004 ) observational period we have found the north - south asymmetry @xmath0 of linear polarization degree p and its seasonal variations ( ) ( parameter of asymmetry @xmath0 is a difference between values of linear polarization degree on north and south at the latitudes @xmath1 at the central meridian ) .",
    "@xmath0 data are well organized if plotted in accordance with jupiter s orbital location and there is some relation between variations of polarization and insolation ( ) . in this work",
    "we are continuing our studying the long - period variations of parameter @xmath0 : 1 ) our new observations are used ; 2 ) our old data ( 1981 - 1998 ) have been reprocessed using new improved technique ; 3 ) hall and riley data ( 1971 - 1974 ) ( ultraviolet , visual spectrum range ) ( ) are involved for analysis .",
    "new variant of p - asymmetry ( on top ) and intensity ratio ( below ) dependences on jupiter s orbital location are presented in the fig.1 .",
    "to investigate the nature of the dependence the approximations have been made using different functions .",
    "the best approximation was shown by one - periodic function ( correlation coefficient is equal to 0.6 . for comparison , correlation coefficients : for line approximation is 0.23 ; for two - periodic function , which had been used in previous publications ( ) , is 0.31 ) .",
    "hall and riley data ( ) have a good agreement with our data . as one can see ( fig.1 )",
    "there is an anticorrelation of long - term variations of polarization and insolation .",
    "thus , assumption about existence of the seasonal variations of north - south asymmetry of polarization , proposed in our previous papers , is correct . moreover it is possible to assume that variations of insolation are the principal cause of the seasonal variations of polarization . how seasonal variations of insolation may result in seasonal variations of polarization ?",
    "we suppose that by way of variations of temperature .",
    "jupiter has a small axial tilt ( about 3 ) .",
    "however , the orbital eccentricity of 0.05 results in 20% variation in the dilution factor @xmath2 values due to the changing of the distance r from the sun . besides , the perihelion and maximum of jovian latitude of the sun are almost coinciding in time .",
    "these factors are causing the great seasonal fluctuations of the incident solar radiation and causing the north - south asymmetry in insolation and temperature . as a result ,",
    "seasonal variations of temperature are appear ( mean temperature in jupiter s atmosphere may vary in the range @xmath3 k ) ( beebe , suggs & little 1986 , caldwell , cess & carlson , 1979 ) . which agent in jupiter s atmosphere may be sensitive to changes of temperature ? data of polarimetric observations in visible , infrared and ultraviolet range are sensitive to presence of stratospheric aerosols haze in jovian atmosphere .",
    "this haze is located at the top pressure levels in the range from a few mbar to a few tenths of mbar , with much more abundance at high latitudes ( latitudes greater than 40 - 50 ) . aerosols of this haze may be in unstable state and temperature ( west 1988 , xanthakis et al . , 1980 ) changing may influence on generation / dissociation of particles .",
    "the anticorrelation of polarization asymmetry and insolation may be caused by following mechanism . because of essential heating of thin stratospheric aerosol layer ( in jovian summer ) the substance of haze may leave state of supersaturated vapor .",
    "condensation become slower , concentration of particles decreases and polarization also decreases ( as known , the rate of condensation decreases when temperature increases ) .",
    "thus , possible scenario of appearance of north - south asymmetry of polarization is : seasonal variations of insolation @xmath4 seasonal variations of temperature @xmath4 changes of activity of aerosol generation @xmath4 aerosol concentration changes @xmath4 polarization changes @xmath4 changes of north - south asymmetry of linear polarization .",
    "we investigated influence of solar wind , solar cosmic rays and x - rays on polarization values .",
    "we have found that some correlation between @xmath0 and solar cosmic rays flux ( protons , @xmath5 ) may exist ( fig.2 ) .",
    "let s pay attention to group of points , which marked on fig.2 ( 1998 , 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "these points greatly deviate just as on fig 1 .",
    "maybe , extremely large flux of high - energy protons in this years ( which has been registered ) had influenced on increasing of polarization values .",
    "atmosphere temperature may be changed with increasing of amount of high - energy protons in jupiter s atmosphere , as it happens at the earth s stratosphere ( xanthakis j. et al .",
    "these changes may influence on aerosol generation processes and be a cause of polarization asymmetry .",
    "protons of high energy may also be an additional centers of condensations and thus may influence on aerosol concentrations and consequently on polarization .",
    "1 .   there is an anticorrelation between polarization asymmetry and insolation .",
    "2 .   seasonal variations of insolations ( through variations of temperature ) is the principal cause of variations of north - south asymmetry of polarization .",
    "3 .   probably , there is some influence of solar cosmic rays flux ( protons , @xmath5 ) on polarization value .",
