    "it is now experimentally well established at hera @xcite that a substantial fraction of @xmath2 events is contributable to diffraction , i.e. color singlet exchange , initiated by a highly virtual photon .",
    "starting with the pioneering theoretical work of ref.@xcite , the idea of a point - like structure of the pomeron exchange opens the way to the determination of its parton ( quark and gluon ) distributions , where the pomeron point - like structure can be treated in a similar way as ( and compared to ) the proton one .",
    "indeed , leading twist contributions to the proton diffractive structure functions can be defined by factorization properties @xcite in much the same way as for the full proton structure functions themselves . as such",
    ", they should obey dglap evolution equations @xcite , and thus allow for perturbative predictions of their @xmath3 evolution .    indeed ,",
    "such parton distributions are very useful to investigate the difficult and longstanding problem of the nature of the pomeron regge singularity . on a phenomenological ground ,",
    "they are the basis of mc simulations like rapgap @xcite and they give a comparison basis with `` hard '' diffraction at tevatron , where the factorization properties are not expected to be valid .",
    "moreover , the study of diffractive parton distributions is also a challenge for the discussion of different approaches and models where other than leading twist contributions can be present in hard diffraction .",
    "indeed , there exists strong presumptive evidence that higher twist effects may be quite important in diffractive processes contrary to non - diffractive ones which do not require ( at least at not too small @xmath3 ) such contributions .",
    "in fact , there are models which incorporate non - negligible contributions from higher twist components , especially for relatively small masses of the diffractive system .",
    "one of our goals is to take into account this peculiarity of diffractive processes .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to derive parton distributions of the pomeron from qcd fits of diffractive dis cross - sections determined at hera @xcite . by comparison with previous determinations contained in the experimental papers ,",
    "we introduce some new techniques of parametrizations and discuss various points which have appeared in the domain :    -the precise determination of the effective pomeron and reggeon trajectories in regge fits    -the determination of the parton distributions at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the pomeron comparing two methods , either using cuts in order to damp the expected higher twist contributions or by a _ global fit _ including a higher twist contribution taken from models    -the differences between parton distributions derived from zeus and h1 data    -the need to evaluate precisely the gluon content of the pomeron and its error since it has strong impact on the discussion of diffractive charm and longitudinal diffractive structure functions    -the extrapolation of the diffractive structure function to single diffraction in @xmath4 collisions at tevatron could give a precise evaluation of the factorization breaking .",
    "our paper is structured in the following way : in section * ii * , we show regge fits and the corresponding determination of intercepts from h1 ( * ii - a * ) and zeus ( *",
    "ii - b * ) data using a new method described in the appendix * a1*. in section * iii",
    "* we use the same data but with additional cuts including a high @xmath1 cut to determine the parton distributions of the pomeron in a nlo dglap evolution framework .",
    "the possibility of two different fits for h1 ( * iii - a * ) and a remaining difference between h1 and zeus ( * iii - b * ) are thoroughly examined . in section * iv * , we perform a new _ global fit _ analysis by removing the high @xmath1 cut , and using models to provide the higher twist contribution . in * iv - a * we check the stability of the determination of the leading twist parton distributions of the pomeron . in * iv - b",
    "* we discuss the obtained gluon density in the pomeron ( for h1 and zeus fits ) and examine the corresponding predictions for the diffractive charm ( * iv - c * ) and longitudinal ( * iv - d * ) components .",
    "the final selection of parameters for h1 and zeus fits is given in appendix * a2*. in section * v * we discuss the important consequence of these determinations for single diffraction at the tevatron , as measured by the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "we see that the conclusions on factorization breaking are markedly different for the h1 and zeus determinations .",
    "conclusions and outlook are presented in the final section * vi * , as a discussion of the introductory points .",
    "the diffractive structure function @xmath0 , measured from dis events with large rapidity gaps , can be investigated in the framework of regge phenomenology and expressed as a sum of two factorized contributions corresponding to a pomeron and secondary reggeon trajectories .",
    "@xmath5    in this parameterisation , @xmath6 can be interpreted as the pomeron structure function and @xmath7 as an effective reggeon structure function , with the restriction that it takes into account various secondary regge contributions which can hardly be separated .",
    "the pomeron and reggeon fluxes are assumed to follow a regge behaviour with linear trajectories @xmath8 , such that    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the minimum kinematically allowed value of @xmath11 and @xmath12 gev@xmath13 is the limit of the measurement .    in the first step",
    "we determine the value of the pomeron and reggeon intercepts ( @xmath14 ) from phenomenological fits of h1 data . in equation ( [ reggeform ] ) , the values of @xmath15 are treated as free parameters at each @xmath1 and @xmath3 point .",
    "the values of @xmath16 are free parameters while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are taken from hadron - hadron data ( @xmath19 gev@xmath20 , @xmath21 gev@xmath20 , @xmath22 gev@xmath20 , @xmath23 gev@xmath20 ) , since the data are not precise enough to determine the @xmath24-slopes @xcite . in order to avoid the region that may be most strongly affected by a non - zero value of the ratio @xmath25 of the longitudinal to the transverse cross - sections ,",
    "only data with @xmath26 are included in the fit .",
    "note that the fit with a single trajectory does not give a good description of the data ( @xmath27 65.5/19 with statistical errors only ) .",
    "this confirms the observations @xcite that secondary trajectories in addition to the pomeron are required to describe diffractive @xmath2 data .",
    "a much better fit is thus obtained when both a leading ( @xmath28 ) and a sub - leading ( @xmath29 ) trajectory are considered .",
    "since the sub - leading exchange is poorly constrained by the data , a second fit is performed to the h1 data in which the values of @xmath30 are taken from a parameterisation of the pion structure function @xcite , with a single free normalization .",
    "we use the pion structure function of ref.@xcite to be able to extrapolate , as it has a constant value for a @xmath3 less than 4 gev@xmath13 . ]",
    "our fits to lower @xmath3 . in principle , an interference term could be introduced in equation ( [ reggeform ] ) , but this does not modify the @xmath31 of the fit .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath32 is in agreement with that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and is significantly larger than values extracted from soft hadronic data ( @xmath33 ) . also , we find @xmath34 .",
    "the use of the pion structure function in our treatment is questionable as the reggeon intercept is close to the rho value and not to the pion one .",
    "however , the h1 data where a proton or a neutron is tagged in the final state can be described nicely by pion and reggeon exchanges where the reggeon structure function is also taken to be the pion one @xcite .",
    "we thus do not expect a significant bias due to this assumption .",
    "a well - known technical problem for the determination of the regge fit at each @xmath1 and @xmath3 point is the correct identification of the actually free parameters .",
    "we use a new method described in appendix * a1 * and perform a direct fit of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , this method is designed to take into account the decorrelations between the parameters and to give a more reliable minimization procedure . without using this method ,",
    "many local minima are present in the @xmath31 which might give an incorrect value of the exponents .",
    "this method leads to better and faster convergence properties for the regge fits procedure when applied to h1 data since the number of parameters to be fitted is much smaller .",
    "we find the following values  : @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( statistical errors only ) , which are close to those determined previously .",
    "we keep these values fixed in the next sections .",
    "we performed the same study using zeus data and we find a pomeron intercept @xmath39 , compatible with what has been obtained by the zeus collaboration @xcite . this value is lower than the h1 value , @xmath40 and @xmath41 including the 1800 gev @xmath4 cross - section @xcite . ] extracted in the previous section , however , the selection of the diffractive sample in zeus is different from h1 @xcite .",
    "we will come back to this last point in the following .",
    "the reggeon contribution is also found to be compatible with zero since the method of measurement ( the so - called @xmath42 method ) is not sensitive to the reggeon component @xcite .",
    "as we have already indicated in equation ( 1 ) , the diffractive structure function @xmath0 can be investigated in the framework of regge phenomenology . moreover",
    ", it has been suggested that the @xmath3 evolution of these structure functions may be understood in terms of parton dynamics @xcite , i.e. as coming from leading twist , perturbative qcd contributions where parton densities are evolved according to dglap equations @xcite .",
    "this idea has been tested in ref .",
    "@xcite with an iterative method using the cteq evolution code @xcite over infinitesimal steps in @xmath43 space to solve the nlo dglap equations @xcite . in the following",
    "we redo this analysis of h1 data with a new polynomial method to solve dglap equations at nlo @xcite .",
    "we assign parton distribution functions to the pomeron and to the reggeon .",
    "a simple prescription is adopted in which the parton distributions of both the pomeron and the reggeon are parameterised in terms of non - perturbative input distributions at some low scale @xmath44 gev@xmath13 .    as we said in the last chapter",
    ", the pion structure function @xcite is assumed for the sub - leading reggeon trajectory with a free global normalization to be determined by the data .    for the pomeron",
    ", a quark flavour singlet distribution ( @xmath45 ) and a gluon distribution ( @xmath46 ) are parameterized in terms of coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 at @xmath49 gev@xmath13 as it was done in ref .",

    "any bias towards a particular solution due to the choice of the functional form of the input distribution is therefore minimized .",
    "the trajectory intercepts are fixed to @xmath59 and @xmath60 and @xmath61 , one gets the same values as in section * ii*. ] ( as explained in the last section ) .",
    "only data points of h1 with @xmath62 gev@xmath13 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 gev and @xmath65 are included in the fit in order to avoid large higher twist effects and the region that may be most strongly affected by a non - zero value of @xmath25 .",
    "we will discuss this point in the following when we take into account the higher twist contribution to the diffractive structure functions .",
    "the fits include 161 data points for 7 parameters ( 3 for the sea quark density , 3 for the gluon density and 1 for the normalization of the reggeon contribution ) .",
    "thus , we have 154 degrees of freedom .    to get solvable evolution equations , the parton distribution functions must approach zero as @xmath66 .",
    "this is achieved by introducing the exponential term with a positive value of the parameter @xmath67 . unless otherwise indicated ,",
    "in the following fits @xmath67 is set to @xmath68 such that this term only influences the parametrisation in the region @xmath69 .",
    "this term is only present to ensure the convergence and plays a role in a domain where we do not include data .",
    "( for instance , at @xmath700.65 , its value is equal to 0.97 . )",
    "the functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 are evolved to higher @xmath3 using the next - to - leading order dglap evolution equations .",
    "the contribution to @xmath73 from charm quarks is calculated in the fixed flavour scheme using the photon - gluon fusion prescription given in  @xcite .",
    "the contribution from heavier quarks is neglected .",
    "no momentum sum rule is imposed because of the theoretical uncertainty in specifying the normalization of the pomeron or reggeon fluxes and because it is not clear that such a sum rule is appropriate for the parton distributions of a virtual exchange . after fitting , however , we observed that the sum rules were fulfilled within 10% despite being not required in the fits .",
    "the resulting parton densities of the pomeron are presented in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . one possible fit quoted here as _",
    "fit 1 _ shows a large gluonic content .",
    "the quark contribution is much smaller compared to the gluon one .",
    "an other much less favoured fit , quoted here as _ fit 2 _ , has a peaked gluon distribution at high @xmath1 . compared to _ fit 1 _ ( the @xmath31 per degree of freedom is 1.15 for _ fit 1 _ and 1.25 for _ fit 2 _ ) .",
    "furthermore , _ fit 2 _ is quite unstable : changing the parameters a little modifies the gluon distribution at high @xmath52 , and removing some data points at low or medium @xmath1 for instance destroys this fit completely .",
    "the quark distribution is similar for both fits , but the gluon distribution tends to be quite different at high values of @xmath52 .",
    "this can be easily explained as no data above @xmath74 are included in the fits .",
    "thus there is no constraint from the data at high @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , we keep _ fit 1 _ as the best fit for h1 diffractive cross - sections . ]",
    "it should be noticed that only the first solution is found if one imposes in the fit that the parton distributions have no zero over the full @xmath1 and @xmath3 range , whereas the second fit appears when this condition is removed .",
    "the appearance of a second solution in our fit to the h1 data is very reminiscent of the results presented in ref .",
    "in fact , the general characteristics of the two solutions obtained in the present paper and of those found in ref .",
    "@xcite are quite similar : the difference in the gluon content at large @xmath52 ( or @xmath1 ) , and the instability of the high - gluon solution with respect to cuts in the data used for the fit .",
    "nevertheless , one has to be careful in comparing the results of ref .",
    "@xcite with the present ones : whereas the former ones represent fits to the diffractive cross section @xmath0 , the present analysis describes results for diffractive parton densities .",
    "the result of the fit ( _ fit 1 _ ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] together with the experimental values for h1 data points ; we see on this figure the good agreement of the qcd fit with the data points , which supports the validity of the description of the pomeron in terms of partons following qcd dynamics . in fig .",
    "[ btplot ] we also compare the scaling violations obtained in the fit to the h1 measurement .",
    "let us discuss the assumptions we made in the qcd fits .",
    "we took @xmath75 and we noticed that the @xmath31 of the fit increases significantly if we try to lower this value of @xmath76 ( @xmath77dof=1.5 if @xmath76=1 gev@xmath13 ) , indicating that the fit can not be extended to lower @xmath3 .",
    "we will come back to this point in the following .",
    "we performed the fits including three chebyshev polynomials . including one more polynomial",
    "does not improve the @xmath31 of the fit , while two polynomials are also not enough to get a good convergence of the fit ( @xmath78dof=1.7 ) .",
    "the parametrizations used in this analysis are given in formulae ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) : indeed , the behaviour at large @xmath52 is forced to go to 0 when @xmath52 goes to 1 by the term @xmath79 which includes an essential singularity at @xmath80 .",
    "we tried to perform the analysis with @xmath81 imposing the behaviour at large @xmath52 with a term in @xmath82 . with these assumptions",
    ", we did not get any fits with a good @xmath31 ( @xmath31/dof @xmath832 ) .",
    "the form of the parametrization for the parton distribution at large @xmath52 plays a non - negligible role in the fit procedure to ensure a quick convergence at high @xmath52 . however , this term is large in a region where no data are included in the fit . on a more physical ground , it is interesting to note that this behaviour is in contrast with the one for proton ( or even pion , cf .",
    "drell - yan analysis ) structure functions for which the behaviour of the distribution tail is seen in a rather sizable region of @xmath84    the positive scaling violations of diffractive structure functions lead to an important gluon content @xmath85 in the pomeron ( even at large @xmath52 ) , which is what we get from qcd fits ( see fig . [ btplot ] ) .",
    "moreover , with this gluon distribution , larger scaling violations at low @xmath1 are naturally associated with larger values of gluon splitting functions when @xmath1 gets lower .",
    "now , it is also clear that , due to large measurement uncertainties , scaling violations and thus the determination of @xmath86 are not very precise .",
    "the uncertainty on the value of @xmath87 is negligible in this analysis , and we can get direct access to the uncertainty on the gluon density ( determined from qcd fits ) .",
    "we get from the investigation of the scaling violations @xmath88    we believe that this ( even not yet precise ) error determination is a relevant piece of information , showing that the gluon density is not yet very well constrained .    in conclusion , the gluon content of the pomeron is confirmed to be large ( w.r.t .",
    "the flat gluon solution is favoured , and another result ( _ fit 2 _ ) appears if we allow that the parton distributions can possibly vanish in the kinematical range .",
    "moreover this second solution is disfavoured due to its worse @xmath31 and instability and thus , we will not use this second solution in the following .",
    "the accuracy of the gluon determination is still quite poor .",
    "this provides a very nice perspective for diffractive analyses of more recent data where more accurate results will lead to a more precise qcd analysis .",
    "we have redone this qcd analysis with zeus diffractive cross - section measurements @xcite applying the same cuts .",
    "note that for the zeus fits , there are only 6 parameters since the method of measurement is not sensitive to the reggeon contribution @xcite .",
    "the pomeron intercept is fixed to @xmath89 as determined from regge fits on zeus data @xcite .",
    "the resulting parton distributions are presented in fig .",
    "[ fh1zeus ] together with the h1 results",
    ". as the pomeron intercepts are different for h1 and zeus data , the parton densities are normalized to represent @xmath90 times the true parton densities multiplied by the flux factor at @xmath91 .",
    "we notice some large discrepancies , especially in the gluon density .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fh1zeus ] ) because the diffractive structure function is more sensitive to the quark density ( the photon couples directly to quark ) .",
    "this will however lead to differences in the charm structure function as it is much more sensitive to the gluon structure function . ]",
    "the gluon density derived from zeus measurements is lower that the h1 fit results .",
    "the data are compared directly in fig .",
    "6 where we rescaled the h1 data to the zeus bins ( the rescaling is not very model - dependent since the shifts in @xmath3 and @xmath1 between both experiments are quite small , and we performed the rescaling using models in ref .",
    "@xcite @xcite , which lead to the same result ) .",
    "in addition to this treatment of data , about 10% ( 30 % ) of the cross - section should be subtracted to take into account proton dissociation contribution in the h1 ( zeus ) cross - section measurement . from fig .",
    "6 , we notice that the main differences are located in the highest @xmath3 bins ( @xmath92 gev@xmath13 ) after this additional correction and could be due to the different methods used to do this measurement ( rapidity gap method or so - called @xmath42 method @xcite ) . however , there are only 30 zeus data points entering in the qcd analysis compared to 161 for h1 analysis , the experimental uncertainties being of the same order .",
    "thus , the statistical power of the zeus fits is considerably lower . we can estimate the statistical uncertainty on the gluon distribution to be about 50% for zeus data ( to be compared with 25% for h1 data ) .",
    "the differences in the quark densities are much smaller taking into account the fact that there is no zeus data at @xmath93 gev@xmath13 and low @xmath1 .",
    "differences in the parton distributions are clearly due to small differences in the data ( see fig . [ fh1zeus ] ) .",
    "we see differences in the @xmath3=60 gev@xmath13 , @xmath1=0.7 , or @xmath3=8 gev@xmath13 , @xmath1=0.2 bins .",
    "as the fit results are quite different for both experiments , we choose to make predictions for the longitudinal and charm structure functions for both sets of parameters .",
    "the h1 fit ( _ fit 1 _ ) is our reference and we attempt to refine it by extending the number of data points included into the fit procedure .",
    "the problem is that the cuts described above are essential to avoid the experimental domain where non - perturbative power contributions could be large and we can not suppress these cuts without subtracting in another way these power contributions ( or higher - twist terms ) .",
    "however , some parametrizations for higher - twist contributions have been proposed @xcite after a dedicated analysis of h1 data .",
    "we use the results of ref .",

    "we notice the perfect agreement between parton distributions extracted with this procedure and with our former analysis described above . however , the statistical power of the new procedure is better due to the larger number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we also note that the @xmath31/dof is smaller when we perform the fit after subtracting the higher twist component ( 1.05 compared to 1.15 , see fig . 7 ) .",
    "this implies that a small residual higher twist component is still present near @xmath1=0.65 which influences the quality of the fit , and thus , it is quite dangerous to cut directly in the data .",
    "as we now include all data in the fit , the assumption we made on the @xmath67 parameter of equation ( [ gluon ] ) may play a role .",
    "we checked as before that the convergence is not possible if we include a polynomial instead of an exponential form ( the @xmath31 per degree of freedom increases up to 2 . ) .",

    "we note a large discrepancy both in shape and normalization between h1 predictions and cdf data , clearly showing factorization breaking . however , the zeus fits are more compatible in normalization with the cdf measurement even if the shape is not described properly .",
    "we know that the zeus gluon density is between 2 and 3 times smaller than the h1 one .",
    "the predictions for the tevatron are thus expected to be very much different by a factor 2 to 3 between h1 and zeus since they correspond to single pomeron exchange . if the large statistical and systematic uncertainties on the gluon density are taken into account ( about 50% for zeus , 25% for h1 ) , zeus data are compatible with factorization at low @xmath1 .",
    "one should , however , question whether one has the right to extrapolate zeus results without introducing an additional reggeon component . namely the cdf measurement is in a region in @xmath100 where the reggeon contribution is important , in contrary to the zeus measurement .",
    "the error bar on the zeus fit extrapolation is thus enhanced due to this uncertainty . concerning the extrapolation of the h1 fit and the comparison with cdf data",
    ", one must notice that the cdf data lie primilarly at low values of @xmath1 where there are few h1 data points .",
    "moreover , in this kinematical domain , the h1 data have the tendency to lie more in the high @xmath100 region where the reggeon contribution is important and not well constrained by the fit .",
    "thus , the extrapolation to the cdf domain suffers from large uncertainties .",
    "a combined fit using cdf data to constrain the low @xmath1 region and the hera data to constrain the high @xmath1 domain would thus be of great interest .",
    "more precise data from hera and more detailed comparisons with tevatron are thus needed to study precisely factorization breaking between both experiments .",
    "the discussion of eventual higher twist contributions is clearly also valuable in order to reach conclusions on the shape at larger @xmath106 it is thus important to get an accurate measurement of the gluon density in the pomeron at low values of @xmath1 from hera .",
    "furthermore the forward proton detector @xcite installed by the d0 collaboration for run ii will be of great help to get a direct measurement of the diffractive structure functions .",
    "let us again go through the points discussed in the introduction :    -we have developped a new method to get the pomeron and reggeon exponents using regge fits , confirming a higher value of the pomeron intercept in `` hard '' diffraction than in soft processes using a more precise method .",
    "-we propose ( and check the stability ) of a new nlo dglap fit to the diffractive structure functions .",
    "we have obtained parton distributions for the pomeron using h1 and zeus data .",
    "-h1 and zeus data both require a large gluon component inside the pomeron but the gluon densities are quite different .",
    "the quark densities are found to be similar in shape and magnitude .",
    "using a parametrisation for the higher twist contribution to @xmath99 allows us to get a description of the full set of data using the nlo dglap evolution equations , and leads to the same parton distribution as before .",
    "the longitudinal diffractive structure function measurement could allow us to further constrain these higher twist parametrisations .",
    "-differences in the h1 and zeus gluon distributions lead to significant differences in the longitudinal and charm contributions to @xmath99 .",
    "the low @xmath3 extrapolation shows some scaling violations which do not seem to be present in the data , which might be a sign of saturation effects .",
    "-the same difference leads to diverging extrapolations for single diffraction at the tevatron .",
    "while the h1-based extrapolation leads to a strong factorization breaking in both shape and normalization ( at least a factor of 10 with respect to cdf data ) , the zeus - based extrapolation leads to a possible compatibility with factorization at least in the small @xmath1 ( large diffractive mass ) range .",
    "all these questions deserve a development of experimental and theoretical work in this domain , with the prospects of undestanding key aspects of qcd properties of `` hard '' diffraction .",
    "the possibility of diffractive production of heavy objects ( jets , higgses ) at tevatron even enhances the interest of such studies .",
    "we thank a.brandt , d.goulianos , p.marage , p.newman , and p.van mechelen for useful discussions and a careful reading of the manuscript .        a fit",
    "is then performed in each @xmath108 bins . @xmath109 and @xmath110 are only related to the @xmath111 bin considered , which means that they can be fitted within this bin by minimizing the following @xmath112 functions        where the @xmath115 index runs over the number of points with different values of @xmath90 in the @xmath116 bin considered and @xmath117 is the statistical error on @xmath99 ( denoted @xmath118 in the following ) .",
    "we use the notations                in conclusion , all @xmath120 and @xmath121 parameters should not be introduced without care as free parameters in the global regge fit as they satisfy the two last expressions in terms of @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , which reduces considerably the number of free parameters .",
    "indeed only @xmath128 free parameters remain  : @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "* appendix a2 : zeus and h1 fit parameters * @xmath0 can be expressed as a sum of two factorized contributions corresponding to a pomeron and secondary reggeon trajectories .",
    "the pomeron and reggeon fluxes are assumed to follow a regge behaviour with linear trajectories @xmath8 , such that          the values of @xmath16 are free parameters while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are taken from hadron - hadron data ( @xmath19 gev@xmath20 , @xmath21 gev@xmath20 , @xmath22 gev@xmath20 , @xmath131 gev@xmath20 the pomeron intercept coming from regge fits is @xmath37 for h1 , and @xmath132 for zeus .",
    "the reggeon structure function is needed only to describe h1 data , and the value of @xmath38 , with the normalization @xmath133 .",
    "the values of @xmath30 are taken from a parameterisation of the pion structure function @xcite .",
