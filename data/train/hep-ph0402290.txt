    "various methods of extracting the value of the unitarity - triangle angle @xmath1 from data have been proposed in the literature . some of them are based on the analysis of the decays of @xmath4 mesons into a pair of light pseudoscalar mesons @xmath5 , and in particular into the @xmath6 states . with most present data on asymmetries in @xmath7",
    "decays still carrying large errors , fits to the branching ratios and asymmetries of @xmath7 decays depend mainly on the former .    in the simplest approach @xcite to these",
    "decays the full @xmath7 amplitudes are given in terms of only a few short - distance ( sd ) amplitudes corresponding to specific quark - line diagrams ( tree @xmath8 , colour - suppressed @xmath9 , penguin @xmath10 , singlet penguin @xmath11 ) expected to provide the dominant contributions .",
    "the penguin amplitude is furthermore assumed to be dominated by the contribution from the internal top quark propagation @xcite .",
    "the only electroweak penguin that has to be kept is included through an appropriate replacement in colour - suppressed strangeness - changing amplitude .",
    "the value of angle @xmath1 extracted from such analyses depends of course on strong sd phases and on possible modifications of the sd formulae by aditional effects . among the latter effects",
    "the issue of the size of rescattering contribution has been addressed by several investigators .",
    "the rescattering ( or final state interaction - fsi ) contribution is composed of two main parts : the contribution in which the intermediate state contains charmed quarks ( so - called charming penguins ) @xcite , and the contribution from elastic and inelastic rescattering through intermediate states involving only light ( ie .",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) quarks @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite",
    "the latter contribution was analysed in detail for the su(3)-symmetry breaking case .",
    "the main conclusion of ref @xcite was that inclusion of such effects may significantly affect the extracted value of angle @xmath1 .",
    "namely , while for negligible strong sd phases the global fits to the branching ratios of all @xmath2 decays yielded the value of @xmath15 , similar fits with rescattering effects included permitted values of @xmath1 in a broad range of @xmath16 , and actually even preferred a value of @xmath1 in qualitative agreement with sm expectations of @xmath17 .",
    "paper @xcite left open the issue of the effect induced by charming penguins .",
    "furthermore , the size of the contribution from inelastic rescattering , required for the shift of the extracted value of @xmath18 down by some @xmath19 , was a factor of five larger than the estimates of the size of quasi - elastic rescattering in a regge model @xcite . given low experimental bounds on the size of the observed branching ratios of the @xmath20 decays , which are thought to provide a bound on the size of rescattering effects , one might therefore argue that these effects should be much smaller than those resulting from the fits of ref.@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we address again the question of the size of corrections to the dominant @xmath21-quark contributions to penguin amplitudes , and show that shifts in the extracted value of @xmath1 of the order of @xmath0 may result from the inclusion of sd charming penguins .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the use of the updated values of the @xmath7 branching ratios shifts the value of @xmath1 extracted when no rescattering is considered down by @xmath22 when compared to the fit of @xcite .",
    "although for the recent values of branching ratios the agreement with the data is now worse than in ref.@xcite , the data do point out to a lower value of @xmath1 .",
    "in this paper the dominant short - distance amplitudes are parametrized exactly as in @xcite .",
    "thus , we assume that all their strong phases are negligible .",
    "although these phases may be non - zero @xcite , their precise values are not relevant for what we want to discuss here : the aim of this paper is to look at uncertainties not related to these phases ( as long as the latter remain small ) .",
    "thus , for the tree amplitudes we use @xmath23 with ( un)/primed amplitudes denoting strangeness ( preserving)/changing processes .",
    "both tree amplitudes have the same weak phase : @xmath24 .    assuming that the penguin sd amplitudes are dominated by the @xmath21 quark , the weak phase factor is @xmath25 for @xmath10 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 ( ie .",
    "@xmath28 ) .",
    "we use the estimate @xcite @xmath29 in the following we use @xmath30 , which is in agreement with the world average @xcite @xmath31 .",
    "we accept the relations between the tree and the colour - suppressed amplitudes given by the sd estimates : @xmath32 and @xmath33 where we take @xmath34 , assuming @xmath35 , ie .",
    "midway between @xmath36 and the value of @xmath37 suggested by experiment , and using @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the contribution from the electroweak penguin @xmath40 has been included in eq.([cprime ] ) , with @xmath41 @xcite ( other electroweak penguins are neglected ) .    finally , since data suggests that the singlet penguin amplitude @xmath42 is sizable ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) we include it in our calculations as well , with weak and strong phases as for @xmath27 .",
    "the remaining sd amplitudes ( exchange @xmath43 and @xmath44 , singlet penguin @xmath11 , penguin annihilation @xmath45 etc . ) are neglected .",
    "thus , the dominant sd amplitudes depend on four sd parameters : @xmath46 , @xmath27 , @xmath42 , and the weak phase @xmath1 .    because rescattering effects induced by pomeron exchange are fully calculable , we correct for them following ref.@xcite ( the relevant theoretical formulae for all @xmath7 amplitudes in question",
    "are given in table 1 therein ) .",
    "actually , it is only when su(3 ) is broken that these corrections are different for different decay channels , and the resulting deviations from the standard sd form could be observed .    as in ref.@xcite",
    "we minimize the @xmath47 function defined as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 denote theoretical ( experimental ) cp - averaged branching ratio for the @xmath50-th decay channel .",
    "we consider the same 16 decay channels as in ref.@xcite ( see table 1 ) .",
    "their experimental branching ratios and errors taken from @xcite are given in the second column of table 1 .",
    "these numbers differ from the ones used in @xcite in a couple of entries , the most significant ones ( ie . where the new average is more than one old standard deviation away from the old average ) being for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . in the calculations themselves",
    ", the branching ratios were corrected for the deviation of the ratio of the @xmath54 and @xmath55 lifetimes from unity ( using @xmath56 ) . for a given value of @xmath1 the @xmath47 function",
    "was minimized with respect to @xmath46 , @xmath27 , and @xmath42 .    the resulting dependence on @xmath1 is shown in fig.1 as solid line .",
    "the fitted values of the branching ratios together with their deviations from the experimental numbers are given in columns 3 and 4 of table 1 .",
    "when comparing with the fits of ref.@xcite one observes a strong shift of the minimum ( from just above @xmath57 in @xcite to @xmath58 here ) , and a significant increase in the size of @xmath47 ( from @xmath59 to @xmath60 ) .",
    "the size of both shifts underscores the need to improve the reliability of data .",
    "one observes that the updated fit has problems with the description of not only @xmath61 and @xmath53 as in ref.@xcite , but also , though to a lesser extent , with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the fits of the preceding section assumed sd penguin amplitudes to be totally dominated by top quark contribution @xmath64 .",
    "various kinds of rescattering effects generate additional contributions due to intermediate @xmath12 and @xmath65 quarks , and may modify @xmath64 so that the full penguin contributions ( denoted by @xmath66 ) may be written as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 with @xmath69 being the ckm matrix .",
    "ref.@xcite was concerned with contributions of @xmath70 type . in the su(3)-symmetry breaking case studied in @xcite this contribution varied from channel to channel .",
    "its su(3)-symmetric part was parametrized by a single complex parameter @xmath13 ( one of three effective fsi parameters discussed in @xcite ) , so that for su(3)-symmetric fsis all formulas for individual @xmath7 strangeness - changing amplitudes in @xcite depended on a single fsi - corrected penguin amplitude : @xmath71 where @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "the expression for @xmath74 was , of course , completely analogous .",
    "it was the @xmath75 term above which generated the @xmath76-type term of eq.([puctprim ] ) in @xcite .",
    "thus , in the case of su(3)-symmetric fsis all rescattering effects not involving intermediate charmed quarks can be hidden into the @xmath77 term in eqs.([puct],[puctprim ] ) .",
    "( however , this can not be done in a decay - channel - independent manner if fsi break su(3 ) , the case considered in @xcite . )    as discussed in @xcite , fsi effects may depend on two further effective parameters ( @xmath65 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "the first of them ( @xmath65 ) takes care of `` crossed '' quark - line diagrams and modifies the effective `` tree '' and `` color - suppressed '' diagrams . in refs.@xcite",
    "it was shown that nonzero value of @xmath65 leads to effective @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) amplitudes being mixtures of sd tree and colour - suppressed amplitudes with different strong phases .",
    "the penguin and singlet penguin get similarly mixed .",
    "since in the fits of @xcite small values of @xmath65 were obtained , we shall not be interested here in these corrections .",
    "nonzero value of the other parameter ( @xmath12 ) leads to effective annihilation @xmath80 , exchange @xmath43 and penguin annihilation @xmath45 amplitudes .",
    "parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 describe the contributions from quasi - two - body intermediate states in which the two intermediate mesons belong to multiplets classified by the same or different charge conjugation parities @xmath9 @xcite . if only states composed of two pseudoscalar mesons contributed to the fsi effects , the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 would be proportional to each other ( @xmath81 in the normalization of @xcite ) .",
    "then , from the size of @xmath80 , @xmath43 , @xmath45 amplitudes from eg .",
    "@xmath82 one could determine @xmath12 and evaluate the size of rescattering contribution to penguin amplitudes .",
    "however , intermediate states of c parity opposite to that of the pp state may also contribute .",
    "the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath13 is then relaxed , and one may have small @xmath83 branching ratio and substantial fsi contribution to penguin amplitudes .",
    "ref.@xcite was concerned with this possibility .",
    "the fits performed in @xcite suggest that the @xmath70 term could be substantial .",
    "since a large size of this term may be questioned it would be worthwhile to find other arguments that could support one of the claims of ref.@xcite , namely that keeping only the @xmath84 term may lead to a significant error in the extracted value of @xmath1 .",
    "we shall do that below on the example of the sd charming penguin .    using the unitarity property of the ckm matrix",
    "one may rewrite expressions ( [ puct],[puctprim ] ) as @xcite : @xmath85 since @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the wolfenstein parameter , for negligible @xmath70 the above formulae may be rewritten as @xmath88 with @xmath89 for nonnegligible @xmath90 the simple connection ( [ penguins ] ) between @xmath10 and @xmath27 gets modified to : @xmath91 estimates of @xmath90 using the perturbative approach of ref.@xcite have been performed in ref.@xcite with the result that @xmath92\\sim\\end{array } }   \\left| \\frac{\\tilde{p}_c-\\tilde{p}_u}{\\tilde{p}_t-\\tilde{p}_u } \\right|   { \\begin{array}{c } < \\\\*[-12pt]\\sim\\end{array } } 0.5\\ ] ] and @xmath93\\sim\\end{array } }   \\arg { \\frac{\\tilde{p}_c-\\tilde{p}_u}{\\tilde{p}_t-\\tilde{p}_u } } { \\begin{array}{c } < \\\\*[-12pt]\\sim\\end{array } } 130^o.\\ ] ] although the above numbers are certainly very uncertain it is interesting to see how the inclusion of a charmed penguin of this size will affect the results of the fits of section 2 . in the fit discussed here",
    "we assume that @xmath42 gets modified in a way completely analogous to that for @xmath27 ( cf .",
    "eq.([psprim ] ) ) . as fig .",
    "1 shows ( for which we have selected the limiting cases of @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) , including penguin contributions from the charmed - quark loops ( and assuming negligible @xmath12-quark terms ) may shift down the extracted value of @xmath1 significantly .",
    "specifically , for @xmath96 the shift is of the order of @xmath97 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath47 is not meaningfully smaller ( table 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , problems persist with the description of @xmath98 @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath51 decays ( table 1 ) .",
    "slightly larger values of @xmath101 may shift @xmath1 much more ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "in fact , some calculations suggest that the contributions from the charmed penguins could be much larger than the upper limit of eq.([limits ] ) . for comparison",
    ", the calculations in the second reference of @xcite correspond to @xmath102 , ie . to charming penguins being dominant .",
    "from the considerations of this paper it follows that : + ( 1 ) shifts in the extracted value of @xmath1 , obtained in the fits with nonzero @xmath103 ( and negligible @xmath70 ) of the size suggested by sd dynamics , are quite similar to those found in ref.@xcite for nonzero @xmath70 ( and vanishing @xmath103 ) , and + ( 2 ) given the uncertainty in the size of both @xmath104 and @xmath105type penguins ( as well as in the strong phases of all amplitudes ) , a reliable extraction of @xmath1 requires using additional information ( data on asymmetries ) , possibly combined with a judicious choice of data either insensitive or least sensitive to such uncertainties .",
    "this may be achieved by restricting the considerations to the analysis of the branching ratios and asymmetries of the @xmath106 decays @xcite .",
    "clearly , all information provided by the @xmath106 sector will be included in the fits to all @xmath7 decays , if these fits take into account not only the branching ratios but also the asymmetries . at present ,",
    "such fits based on the branching ratios only seem to depend quite strongly on the precise values of the latter .",
