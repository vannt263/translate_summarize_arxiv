    "in the last few decades a big effort has been made to detect gravitational waves ( gws ) from various sources in deep space .",
    "in particular , we expect a very interesting kind of gw signal , usually referred to as a chirp signal [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : gw](a ) and [ fig : gw](b ) for an example ] , to be emitted by compact binary systems , such as a pair of neutron stars or black holes inspiraling toward each other and then coalescing .",
    "a chirp signal gives us unique information about nonlinear dynamics of matter and space - time , as the gws are emitted from the regions with strong space - time curvature .",
    "compact binary coalescence ( cbc ) and the corresponding gw signal are conventionally split into three stages : inspiral , merger , and ringdown .",
    "the post - newtonian approximation of general relativity ( gr ) @xcite allows a precise prediction of most of the inspiral stage . at this stage ,",
    "the signal has a sinusoidal shape with frequency and amplitude increasing in time .",
    "the latter stages of the inspiral and all of the merger and the ringdown stages are modeled by numerical relativity , and then all stages are continuously sewn together .    once a signal is measured and compared to the templates",
    ", one can extract information about masses and spins of the inspiraling binary objects as well as the equation of state of dense nuclear matter in the case of the merging neutron stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , a sensitive detection of chirp signals might verify or falsify gr or alternative theories of gravity via comparing their predictions with the measured parameters .",
    "schutz in refs .",
    "@xcite and later taylor _ et al .",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite also proposed that the hubble constant can be independently determined in a new and potentially accurate way by observation of the inspiral stage of the chirp gws .    .",
    "]    nowadays , large - scale ground - based laser interferometers are the most sensitive detectors of gws in the frequency range 10 hz5 khz @xcite .",
    "currently , the first generation of gw detectors has finished their operation without any detection , which agrees with the current estimations for their detection rate .",
    "the significantly improved sensitivity of the second - generation detectors will allow us to achieve a detection rate of about 25400 @xmath2 @xcite . upon reaching the earth ,",
    "the gws are only tiny perturbations of the space - time metric causing small variation of the proper distances between the quasi - free - falling test masses of the laser interferometer .",
    "all currently operating and future planned gw detectors are based on the traditional michelson topology , a typical idealized example of which is considered in this paper ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geo1 ] ) : the interferometer consists of a 50/50 beam splitter , perfectly reflecting end mirrors and additional mirrors for signal and power amplification , referred to as the signal - recycling mirror ( srm ) and power - recycling mirror ( prm ) , respectively .",
    "interferometers usually operate near the dark fringe in the output port , meaning that the laser beams reflected from the end mirrors destructively interfere on the beam splitter toward the photo diode .",
    "a gw of appropriate polarization and direction causes antisymmetric ( differential ) motion of the interferometer s end mirrors relative to the beam splitter .",
    "this breaks the destructive interference at the output port allowing a tiny part of the optical field carrying the information about the gw signal to reach the photodetector .",
    "this signal field gets recirculated by the srm , forming the differential mode of the interferometer in the effective signal - recycling cavity ( src ) .",
    "the prm in the laser port increases power at the end mirrors and by recirculating the light reflected from them it creates the common mode of the interferometer in the power - recycling cavity ( prc ) .",
    "this mode is sensitive to the symmetric ( common ) motion of the end mirrors .",
    "therefore the common mode of the detector does not contain any information about the gw signal and in the rest of this paper we only consider the differential mode .",
    "parameters of the src are determined by the properties of the srm : the frequency bandwidth of the cavity is determined by the srm transmittance , and the detuning of the laser carrier frequency from cavity resonance is determined by the microscopic position of the srm . in this sense , the src is equivalent to a simple fabry ",
    "perot cavity @xcite .",
    "the src can be tuned to any desired signal frequency via the proper choice of the cavity detuning .",
    "currently , all gw detectors operate stationary in time , meaning that the parameters of the src are fixed .",
    "there are two typical regimes of detection of chirp signals in this case : a broadband operation and a narrow band operation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bn ] ) . in the former regime",
    "the detector is sensitive to the entire frequency band of the chirp signal , but at moderate sensitivity .",
    "on the contrary , in the narrow band regime , the detector is much more sensitive , but only in a narrow band around the signal frequency to which the src is tuned ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bn ] ) .",
    "since the chirp signal at the inspiral stage is a sine function with frequency increasing in time [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : gw](b ) ] , the peak sensitivity of the narrow - band - operated detector will only be achieved during the short interval of time , when the particular instantaneous frequency of the chirp approximately coincides with the detuning of the src .",
    "another option for the detection of a chirp signal was proposed by meers _",
    "@xcite : real - time tuning of a narrow - band src to the instantaneous frequency of the signal via positioning of the srm , i.e. ,  real - time signal tracking .",
    "this method of detection is referred to as _",
    "dynamical tuning_. however , analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite was performed under the following approximations : ( i ) a shot - noise - limited detector , and ( ii ) slow enough motion of the srm such that the detector can be considered as a quasistationary one ; i.e. ,  all the optical fields evolve adiabatically on the time scale of the motion of the srm .",
    "the latter approximation also sets the limiting instant of time until which the signal can be observed before entering the regime of rapid frequency increase , where quasistationary approximation does not hold anymore . to agree with these approximations ,",
    "the authors considered detecting only a part of the chirp signal  with the instantaneous frequency varying from 100 up to 500hz .",
    "the method developed in this paper allows us to treat the problem of dynamical tuning outside of these approximations .",
    "it should be noted that we do not consider the problem of signal prediction ; we assume that the initial time evolution of the signal is known , for instance , from the low - frequency data of other gw detectors , such that the subsequent evolution of the signal can be predicted .",
    "the response of a stationary - operated detector to gws and all kinds of noise sources is usually calculated in the frequency domain . for a detailed analysis ,",
    "@xcite . a gw detector performing dynamical tuning operates in the nonstationary regime .",
    "the tracking of a chirp signal with a slowly changing frequency may be described with a quasistationary approximation , assuming the detector reaches steady state very fast .",
    "a quasistationary approximation can also be considered in the frequency domain , as it was performed in ref .",
    "however , when the frequency of the signal and , correspondingly , position of the srm change too fast , a frequency - domain analysis is not adequate , and therefore we develop a time - domain analysis to model it properly . in particular , the detector response takes the form of a series over an infinite number of round trips of light inside the src @xcite , the so - called impulse response .",
    "the basics of time - domain and frequency - domain analyses of laser gw detectors this paper is grounded on , including the stationary responses to common and differential modes of a stationary operating interferometer , and its shot - noise sensitivity formulas , are given with sufficient details in ref .",
    "@xcite .    using our time - domain model",
    ", we also calculate the response of the detector to shot noise ( vacuum fluctuation of the electromagnetic field injected from the dark port or lossy optical elements ) and to differential motion of the end mirrors ( caused by the gws and various types of mirror - displacement noise such as thermal noise ) .",
    "the analysis of the transient processes during ideal dynamical tuning , performed using this approach , has shown that only fast amplitude changes cause a deviation from the quasistationary predictions , while the transients from signal frequency and from the srm position cancel each other .",
    "the slow change of amplitude establishes a so - called it virtually stationary detection , when the output signal at every instance of a nonstationary detection has the stationary value , corresponding to the instantaneous parameters of the signal and of the detector .",
    "the radiation pressure noise ( back action ) is omitted for the considered power at the end mirrors in the current model because ( i ) its typical frequencies are lower than the characteristic frequencies of the considered part of chirp signals starting from 200hz ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : quasi ] ) and ( ii ) it is dominated by the other noise sources ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bn ] ) .",
    "finally , we study the possible signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) gains from the implementation of dynamical tuning to the traditional broadband stationary operated detector . for the shot - noise - limited detector the increase of the snr is @xmath0 , and for the detector with both displacement and shot noise , the increase is @xmath1 .",
    "we found that , in contrast to the stationary operated detector limited by both displacement and shot noise , the detector performing dynamical tuning is only displacement noise limited .",
    "this happens because displacement noise and gw signal , both creating the differential motion of the end mirrors , are resonantly enhanced by dynamical tuning in the same manner ( effectively , dynamical tuning tracks and amplifies the same components of displacement noise as of the gw signal ) , while shot noise on the photodetector remains the same ( more precisely , shot noise remains delta correlated independently of the motion of the srm ) .",

    "@xmath8 is the arm length .",
    "the differential displacement of the end mirrors breaks the dark - port condition of a michelson interferometer , injecting signal sidebands into the src . in this paper",
    ", we neglect the optomechanical back - action effects , so the further evolution of sidebands may be reduced to the two elementary phenomena : ( i ) reflections ( and transmissions ) from the mirrors and a beam splitter and ( ii ) propagation through space .",
    "the optical losses in our case may be effectively reduced to the reflections . as part of this evolution , some field exits the dark port and is detected by a photodetector .",
    "the resulting output current on the photodetector @xmath9 contains the information about the differential motion of the end mirrors , caused by gravitational waves .",
    "the response of the detector to the signal under these circumstances can be considered linear for two reasons : ( i ) the smallness of the end - mirror displacements caused by the gw in comparison to the wavelength of the light and ( ii ) the superposition principle for the fields inside the cavity .",

    "the tables also include the current parameters of geo600 and describe the changes required for the implementation of dynamical tuning .",
    "the physics standing behind the impulse response is the following .",
    "the signal pulse created in the src by the differential end - mirror movement makes the round trips between the srm and the end mirrors with the period @xmath19 every time the pulse is reflected from the srm the small part of it leaks from the cavity and is detected at the homodyne detector with the local oscillator ( lo ) field .",
    "these leaked pulses form the infinite number of decaying  echoes \" at the output with amplitudes @xmath20 .",
    "two consequent pulses in this sequence are differing by a decay factor during one round trip @xmath21 , and the phase shift between two consequent impulses is obtained during the reflection from the srm due to its microscopic displacement from the resonant position .",
    "the reflection of light from the beam splitter and from the end mirrors is equivalent to the reflection from a single mirror with the reflectivity @xmath22 defined in eq . .",
    "this mirror and the srm form an equivalent fabry ",

    "perot cavity is presented in appendix [ equiv ] .",
    "the impulse response describes the behavior of a detector also in the stationary case when @xmath23 .",
    "the fourier transformation turns the impulse response into transfer function @xmath24 presented in eq . .",
    "the transfer function describes the response of the detector on the sine gravitational wave .",
    "the wave creates two sidebands in the detector , the amplification of which has resonant features .",
    "the transfer function @xmath24 coincides with those , obtained conventionally in the frequency domain , e.g. ,  in refs @xcite .",
    "therefore , the model for the time - domain response on the gravitational wave is consistent with the accepted frequency - domain models .",
    "gravitational waves cause differential end - mirror motion . however , it is not the only source of this motion .",
    "there is a number of stochastic influences on the end mirrors in geo600 causing it , the most significant of which are thermal noise in mirror coating , seismic noise , and gravity gradient noise @xcite .",
    "the noise is stationary and characterized by its spectral density @xmath25 , the theoretical prediction of which is known and is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : noises ] .",
    "the impulse response to the differential end - mirror motion defines the output current at the photodetector for an arbitrary input .",
    "it is also applicable to stochastic motion of the end mirrors .    for stationary detectors",
    ", it does not matter whether noise and signals are compared at the end mirrors or at the output photocurrent .",
    "the reason is that a linear detector transforms the same frequency components of both noise and signal equally , so the ratio of the intensities of these components does not change .",
    "something similar happens for the nonstationary detector .",
    "although the frequency components here do not evolve independently , the impulse response transforms the same components of the signal as of the noise in the same way .",
    "so , if the information about the signal is transferred completely , it also does not matter where one calculates the sensitivity with respect to the displacement noise .",
    "the completeness of the transferred signal can be proven by consequent action of the direct and of the inverse impulse response , as it is shown in eq . .",
    "when we investigate the influence of displacement noise on the sensitivity of the dynamically tuned detection , we consider displacement noise alone , neglecting shot noise . in this case , it is more convenient to compare the signal and noise at the end mirrors for the following reasons .",
    "the first is the convenient shape of the signal : it is proportional to the gravitational wave strain ( assuming the initial position and velocity of the end mirrors equal zero ) .",
    "the second reason is stationarity of the displacement noise , simplifying the calculations .",
    "the third reason is the independence of the ratio between the signal and the displacement noise from the motion of the srm required for the dynamical tuning .",
    "so the snr may be calculated in the conventional way , e.g. ,  in the frequency domain , using the expression @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fourier transform of the signal differential mirror motion @xmath28 .",
    "if we want to calculate a more realistic sensitivity including both displacement and shot noise , we should treat their influences at the same part of the interferometer . for this purpose it may be more convenient to treat displacement noise at the output of the detector , i.e.  in the signal photocurrent . as it was mentioned , the autocorrelation function of this noise may be found from the one of the end - mirror motion noise via the impulse response , @xmath29 where @xmath30 can be found from the spectral density @xmath25 mentioned above .",
    "quantum shot noise is conventionally considered as ground - state quantum oscillations injected into a cavity through any open port and from lossy elements @xcite . since maxwell s equations are valid for quantum mechanics , the quantum operator of the electromagnetic field can be treated like the classical field values in the previous sections .",
    "let us consider , for example , the quantum field at the point @xmath31 , where the laser shines into the detector ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : geo1 ] ) . the quantum electrical field operator in this point , describing also",

    "the annihilation and creation operators in the other spatial points of geo600 are denoted by the corresponding letter depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo1 ] .",
    "the operator @xmath36 , introduced in , is a fourier transform of the annihilation operator @xmath33 , and represents the amplitude of the electric field .",
    "one has to note , that this fourier transform is performed only within the frequency of the anticipated gws , which is much smaller than the frequency of the laser carrier : @xmath37    in this section , from all the points in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo1 ] we are only interested in the shot - noise injections from the dark - port @xmath38 , injections from the end mirrors @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and the detector dark - port output @xmath41 .",
    "the homodyne detection of the output field @xmath42 gives a signal in the photocurrent , in which we can read out the gws and see the noise .",
    "the main part of shot noise at the output is formed from the ground - state oscillations injected from the dark - port @xmath38 .",

    "this evolution , consisting of a phase shift , propagation , and amplitude change , is described by the complex amplitudes .",
    "therefore , we can express the amplitude of the output field in terms of the input using the complex impulse response , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the complex impulse response and @xmath41 and @xmath38 are the amplitudes of the output and input fields , respectively ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : impulse2](b ) .    the transfer function @xmath57 for the stationary regime can be obtained from eq . .",
    "it is consistent with the results obtained by the conventional calculations in the frequency domain @xcite . in the case of the ideal end mirrors",

    "and with some simplifications leads us to the autocorrelation function of the output shot noise , @xmath59 the amplitudes of the correlations @xmath60 of which are presented in .",

    "the bigger part of the wave reflects directly , remaining delta correlated , and the part transmitted inside makes a sequence of echoes every round trip , each of which is also correlated with the directly reflected wave and with other echoes . because of the properties of white noise , neither echoes , nor directly reflected light correlates with the pieces of wave between the echoes .",
    "as it follows from the expression for coefficients , the autocorrelation function for the detector with ideally reflecting end mirrors @xmath61 keeps only one nonzero summand @xmath62 , meaning the detected shot noise is white . despite the nontrivial transformation of the electromagnetic field of the quantum oscillations inside the detector ,",

    "however the consideration of the displacement or shot - noise - limited nonstationary detector gives already the boundaries that are realistic estimations for the sensitivity gain from dynamical tuning .",
    "chirp signals , for which we want to increase the sensitivity by dynamical tuning , are modeled by using hybrid models @xcite for an arbitrary set of masses and spins of the binary elements . for convenience",

    "the reason for such strong influence of the shot noise could be , e.g. ,  the error in tracking of the signal frequency by the srm position or the use of squeezed shot noise in the referent detector .",
