    "the long - range memory in volatility and trading activity of the financial markets is still one of the most mysterious features attracting permanent attention of researchers @xcite as some ambiguity is still present .",
    "there are numerous works , which construct autoregressive models with embedded long - range memory  such as figarch , lm - arch , fiegarch @xcite .",
    "the slowly decaying auto - correlation for volatility and trading activity , is a characteristic property of the empirical financial time series @xcite .",
    "this empirical property might originate from the true long - range memory process with correlated increments such as the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite or from the markov processes with slowly decaying auto - correlation such as stochastic processes with non - stationary uncorrelated increments @xcite .",
    "the debate whether this slow decay corresponds to long - range memory is still ongoing , econometricians tend to conclude that the statistical analysis in general can not be expected to provide a definite answer concerning the presence or absence of long - range memory in asset price return @xcite .",
    "recently we have proposed an agent - based model , macroscopic dynamics of which can be reduced to fokker - planck equation or a set of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) , which is able to precisely reproduce empirical probability density function ( pdf ) and power spectral density ( psd ) of absolute return @xcite as well as scaling behavior of volatility return intervals @xcite .",
    "similar non - linearity can be introduced into garch(1,1 ) process @xcite to recover @xmath1 noise as well .",
    "this raises a question if the long - range memory present in the financial markets should be embedded into the models or empirically observed property is just an outcome of non - linear agent interactions .    from our point of view",
    "there is a fundamental problem to empirically establish which of the possible alternatives , fbm or stochastic processes with non - stationary increments , is most well - suited to describe financial markets .",
    "the main idea is to employ the dependence of first passage time pdf on hurst parameter @xmath2 for the fbm @xcite .",
    "this is in close connection with research of volatility return intervals @xcite and of first passage times in non - linear stochastic processes @xcite .    in section [ sec : hurst - first - passage ] we present the short theoretical background for our empirical investigation , in section [ sec : empirical ] we deal with empirical data from forex and in section [ sec : conclusion ] we discuss and conclude results .",

    "exemplary fragment of a generic time series .",
    "three threshold , @xmath5 , passage events , @xmath6 , are shown .",
    "thus burst duration @xmath7 can be defined as @xmath8 and inter - burst duration @xmath9 can be defined as @xmath10 . ]",
    "we consider two distinct threshold passage events ",
    "one describes return to the threshold from above , while the other describes return to the threshold from below .",
    "burst duration is the amount of time time series spent above the threshold ( starts with passage from below and ends with passage from above ; @xmath8 in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "while the inter - burst duration is the amount of time series spent below the threshold ( starts with passage from above and ends with passage from below ; @xmath10 in fig .",

    "the pdfs of burst and inter - burst duration for fbm coincide and can be written as @xcite @xmath11 here @xmath2 is the hurst parameter defining the exponent of power - law pdf @xmath12 , which coincides with the corresponding exponent for other one - dimensional markov processes only when @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "burst and inter - burst duration can be defined through the first passage problem with initial value @xmath14 infinitesimally near the threshold @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that the deviation of hurst parameter from @xmath13 indicates about long - range memory in data , but this is not true as class of markov processes with non - stationary increments can generate signals with @xmath16 and slowly decaying auto - correlation @xcite .",
    "we have earlier proposed to model financial markets by non - linear sde , @xcite , which belongs to this class as well .",
    "many other agent - based models with non - linear interactions can lead to the macroscopic description by a non - linear sdes of the following or a similar form@xcite @xmath17 having just two parameters : @xmath18 as exponent of noise multiplicativity and @xmath19 as exponent of power - law pdf .",
    "it was justified by various methods that this class of sde generates the time series with the power - law behavior of stationary pdf and psd @xcite , @xmath20 it is noteworthy that these interconnected power - law properties are the direct outcome of scaling property in fokker - planck equation for two point transition probability @xmath21 corresponding to the sde ( [ eq : sde2 ] ) @xcite @xmath22 the class of sdes ( [ eq : sde2 ] ) describes multifractal stochastic processes with non - stationary increments @xcite and despite it s power - law auto - correlation and psd ( [ eq : power - law ] ) does not imply dynamics with correlated signals like those of fbm . here",
    "we will look for the opportunity to establish test for the empirical data helping to make clear distinction between these two different models with correlated and uncorrelated increments .",
    "the initial idea of such test comes from the pdf of first return times ( [ eq : tpdf ] ) depending on @xmath2 in the case of fbm and corresponding pdf for non - linear sdes ( [ eq : sde2 ] ) characterized by power - law exponent @xmath0 common for all one - dimensional markov processes @xcite .",
    "the burst duration for the non - linear sdes ( [ eq : sde2 ] ) were considered in @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of time @xmath7 pdf can be written in rather transparent form @xmath23 here , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is a first zero of a bessel function of the first kind . the power - law behavior with exponent @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : burst ] ) is consistent with the general theory of the first passage times in one - dimensional stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "empirical evaluation of pdf for burst and inter - burst duration should serve as a test for the nature of stochastic process .",
    "deviations from the power - law with exponent @xmath0 in the case of fbm signals about true long - range dependence . certainly , we will see later , such test is not so straightforward as real processes such as volatility in the financial markets may be more complicated than one - dimensional stochastic processes .",
    "we investigate burst and inter - burst duration for two financial variables : trading activity  number of market trades during selected time window @xmath26 and volatility defined as filtered logarithmic return in the same time window .",
    "following the idea of earlier proposed modeling , where trades arrive as in quasi - poisson process driven by non - linear sde @xcite , we will try to extract statistical properties of driving stochastic process from high frequency trading series in forex .",
