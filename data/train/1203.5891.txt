    "searching for possible variations in the fundamental constants of nature allows us to test whether the laws of physics vary over space and time .",
    "there are many complementary probes that , taken together , span much of the universe s history  ( see , e.g. , the review * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "optical quasar absorption spectra provide a probe of variations in the fine - structure constant , @xmath2 , along a past - light cone centred on present - day telescopes .",
    "numerous works employed comparison of alkali - doublets in space and in the laboratory to place limits on @xmath0-variation ; these are easily interpreted since the energy separations are simply proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite developed a different approach : the many - multiplet method , which exploits larger sensitivities to @xmath0-variation available in heavier ions and in transitions other than alkali - doublets .",
    "moreover , the method allows for better control of systematics because there exist some negative shifters ( with energy intervals that reduce with increasing @xmath0 ) as well as positive shifters and `` anchor lines '' ( which have very weak sensitivity to @xmath0-variation ) . in some cases both positive and negative shifters may be observed in the same ion .",
    "additionally , the many - multiplet method sees a statistical gain because many more observed transitions may be used in the analysis .    during the last several years many absorption systems ,",
    "observed using the keck telescope in hawaii  @xcite and the very large telescope in chile  @xcite , have been analysed . taken together ,",
    "these provide measurements of @xmath1 in @xmath4 absorption systems covering most of the sky . here",
    "@xmath5 is the relative variation in @xmath0 at a particular position @xmath6 in the universe where the absorption occurs . in  @xcite ,",
    "the combined data sample is interpreted as providing evidence for variation in @xmath0 throughout the universe with an angular - dependence .",
    "this `` dipole '' model is found to be preferred to a monopole ( constant offset ) model of the variation at the @xmath7 level .",
    "the values of @xmath1 for each absorber  ( presented in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are modelled in @xcite(see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using several variants of a formula which can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the angle between the direction of the measurement and the axis of the dipole , @xmath10 is a constant ( a `` monopole '' term ) and @xmath11 is the magnitude of the dipole term .",
    "the model variation comes from the form of the factor @xmath11 , which in  @xcite was variously    * @xmath12 , i.e. eq .  ( [ eq : dipolemonopole ] ) represents pure angular - dependence without any distance - dependence ; * @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the lookback time in giga - lightyears ( glyr ) ; * @xmath15 , here @xmath16 is the redshift and @xmath17 is another fitting parameter .",
    "the model of spatial variation that does not include a distance dependence is difficult to understand theoretically , while fitting @xmath18 simply adds a poorly - constrained parameter to the data .",
    "therefore in this paper we test the dipole interpretation @xmath19 . in this form  ( [ eq : dipolemonopole ] ) represents a gradient in the value @xmath0 throughout the universe , and @xmath20 is the distance to a quasar absorption system along that gradient .    of course , @xmath21 itself is model dependent at large redshifts . in this work we use the standard @xmath22 cosmology parametrized by wmap5  @xcite to determine @xmath21 from the redshift @xmath16 : @xmath23 again , this reflects the fact that we are taking measurements along a past light cone centred on present - day earth .",
    "an alternative approach is to use the comoving distance rather than lookback time : @xmath24 in this case the dipole model  ( [ eq : dipolemonopole ] ) is modified to use .",
    "this parameterisation makes physical sense if one imagines that any spatial @xmath0-variation is `` fixed '' to the cmb frame and follows the same scale factor , @xmath25 .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : aicc ] we develop criteria to assess the relative likelihood of different models of @xmath0-variation which we use throughout this work . after testing the normalcy of errors using a quantile - quantile plot ,",
    "we use the modified akaike information criterion to confirm that the preferred model of cosmological @xmath0-variation is a dipole model with a monopole term . in section  [ sec : dipole_significance ] we perform some additional statistical tests to determine the significance of the dipole : an @xmath26-test and a modified error - ellipsoid method , described in detail in appendix  [ sec : eem ] . to test the robustness of the data we perform biased and unbiased clippings of the data . in section",
    "[ sec : dipole_robustness ] it is shown that _ at least _",
    "40% of the quasar absorption systems would need to be removed from the sample to reduce the significance of the dipole to @xmath27 .",
    "the monopole term of our preferred model of @xmath0-variation is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the requirement that @xmath28 should be zero locally , therefore in section  [ sec : magnesium ] we test a hypothesis that changes in the relative isotope abundances of magnesium could lead to the observed monopole term .",
    "we find that a relatively small increase in the abundance of @xmath29 mg relative to @xmath30 mg in the absorbers could account for the monopole term .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : wall ] we test whether the data supports a different model : that a `` domain wall '' separates regions of the universe with different values of @xmath0 ( as proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "finding a best fit for this model requires a genetic algorithm , presented in appendix  [ sec : genetic ] .",
    "the data used in this paper are taken from  @xcite  ( keck data ) and  @xcite  ( vlt ) , kindly supplied by the j. a. king in a usable text format including the location of each absorber ( redshift and direction ) and its measured value of @xmath1 . in total",
    "there are 293 points in our data file including 140 from keck and 153 from vlt of which seven absorbers are seen in both the keck and vlt samples .",
    "the data is described fully in  @xcite , here we just note some points of particular interest to the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "both samples account for unknown sources of scatter in the data by including extra systematic errors , @xmath31 , that are added in quadrature with the underlying statistical error .",

    "the combined data is divided into high-@xmath16 ( @xmath32 ) and low-@xmath16 subsamples , and the high-@xmath16 subsample is further divided into ` low - contrast ' and ` high - contrast ' , defined as systems where both strong and weak lines are fitted .",
    "the 27 systems that constitute the high - contrast sample show large scatter in @xmath1 values , which is attributed to weak components not being fitted when they re near the high optical depth edges of the strong transitions profile . to this high - contrast sample",
    "is added an additional error @xmath33 which serves to reduce @xmath34 per degree of freedom @xmath35 to unity .",
    "the low-@xmath16 and low - contrast high-@xmath16 keck samples do not require additional  @xmath31 .",
    "the vlt / uves data presented in  @xcite also shows too much scatter in @xmath1 . quantifying this scatter depends on the underlying model assumptions , for example if one assumes that the dipole model is correct ( i.e. that there is a physical dipole in @xmath0 that is being observed ) and the data supports this , then @xmath31 should be smaller than it would be for a monopole model .",
    "the data we use includes @xmath36 .",
    "this is a conservative ( large ) value which will tend to reduce the significance of the dipole relative to a monopole model . in practice",
    "all models give values of @xmath31 in the same vicinity  ( see table  2 . of * ? ? ? * ) and the results of this paper are relatively insensitive to the exact @xmath31 used .",
    "in this work we use @xmath34 as a likelihood measure for the various models . for measured values @xmath37 and a model which takes values @xmath38 at the @xmath39th quasar , this is defined as the sum of squared residuals @xmath40 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the observational uncertainty .",
    "@xmath34 corresponds to the negative of the log - likelihood function for the normally - distributed random variable @xmath43 ; smaller values of @xmath34 correspond to better model fits .",
    "the normalcy of the residuals is an implicit assumption in using a @xmath34 statistic .",
    "the validity of such an assumption may be ascertained by way of a quantile - quantile , or q - q , plot , which compares the residuals of a data set against the quantiles of a given distribution , or another sample .",
    "in addition to determining whether a data sample is consistent with a given distribution , a q - q plot is a useful graphical method of comparing the qualitative features , such as skew , of samples of data against statistical distributions .",
    "we compare the residuals from the best fit dipole direction ( light - travel distance ) against a normal distribution in figure  [ fig : qqplot ] .",
    "if our residuals are normal , then we expect the plot to lie approximately across the diagonal .",
    "our comparison , figure  [ fig : qqplot ] , suggests that the residuals are near - consistent with a normal distribution , though it should be observed that there is some ` arching ' in the curve , with the curve being below the diagonal near the tails and above near the centre .",
    "this indicates a negative skewness , that is , a long left - hand tail , in the residual distribution .",
    "however , in light of the relatively small size of our sample , the slight skew we observe does not necessarily indicate that the residuals are not normal .",

    "an alternative explanation to intra - telescope systematics is that the two - value result is simply an artefact due to the two telescopes sampling data from significantly different portions of the sky .",

    "the point with _ largest _ residual was removed at each step of the procedure .",

    "for example , in  @xcite there is no weighting by @xmath75 , and deviant points that lie in the perpendicular plane may be removed .",
    "therefore it is unsurprising that the significance of the dipole increases at first ( fig . 4 in * ?",
    "however , there is a trade - off : the significance eventually falls as more points are removed because there are simply fewer data .",

    "one would then expect the monopole term to have an explicit time - dependence ( or , equivalently , redshift - dependence @xmath77 ) , although the form may not be resolved by the data .    another possible explanation for a monopole could be chemical evolution of the universe , which changes the isotope abundance ratios .",

    "we have applied a simple test to see whether the isotope abundance ratios of magnesium could cause the monopole .",

    "6 of * ? ? ?",
    "a similar analysis applied to the @xmath113 subsample of the keck+vlt data also found that the monopole could be removed by a change in the @xmath111 abundance ratio from the terrestrial value of 0.21 to a heavy - isotope enhanced value of @xmath114  @xcite .",
    "generally other species are present in our quasar absorption spectra , and this could remove the degeneracy between variation of magnesium isotope abundance and variation of @xmath0 . a more complete analysis should allow mg isotope abundances to vary in the fitting procedure , which may be possible if this is restricted to only one additional parameter in the entire sample of @xmath115 absorption systems .",
    "recently a different model for spatial variation of @xmath0 has been proposed by @xcite where the universe is divided into two domains , each with a different value of @xmath0 . on the earth - side of the domain wall",
    "@xmath0 takes the terrestrial value , while on the other side it takes a different value .",
    "we can parametrize this model by the equation @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the shortest distance to the wall ( we use comoving distance , eq .",
    "( [ eq : comoving_distance ] ) , in this section ) and @xmath9 is the angle between the direction of the shortest distance to the wall and a quasar .",
    "again , values for @xmath117 and the direction of the wall are chosen to minimise @xmath34 , however in this case @xmath34 is discontinuous with respect to changes in the parameters : any given quasar must either be on this side of the wall ( model value @xmath56 ) or the other ( model value @xmath82 ) .",
    "this necessitates the use of a genetic algorithm to determine the minimum values of @xmath34 ; our algorithm is presented in appendix  [ sec : genetic ] .    the best fit model for the entire data sample was found to have @xmath118 , @xmath119  gly , @xmath120  hr , @xmath121 . the model has 4-parameters with @xmath122 ; this can be compared with the 4-parameter dipole+monopole model with comoving distance , for which @xmath123 .",
    "however it is worth noting that this minimum @xmath34 is obtained for an extremely narrow range of parameters , and even a small deviation in any of them increases it dramatically . for example , in figure  [ fig : bestfitwall ] we present @xmath34 in the direction of best - fit ( solid line ) as a function of @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath34 for the wall model as a function of comoving distance to the wall , @xmath117 .",
    "solid line : in the direction of the best fit for the wall ( the best fit occurs at @xmath119  gly ) ; dashed line : in the direction of the dipole axis ( decreasing @xmath0 direction ) . by comparison , @xmath34 for the spatial gradient ( dipole ) model is 279.66.,width=302 ]    the best - fit wall is located at an angle @xmath124 to the dipole axis ( towards negative values of @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath125 from the directions presented in table  [ tab : mg_removed ] ) .",
    "this is not consistent : if the universe really does have a domain wall in values of @xmath0 one would expect a dipole fit to the data to have the same direction .",
    "if we calculate @xmath34 as a function of wall distance parameter @xmath117 along the direction that is given by the best - fit dipole we obtain the dashed line in figure  [ fig : bestfitwall ] .",
    "it is seen that the behaviour is much as would be expected if the dipole model is correct : as @xmath117 increases , fewer absorbers are found on the other side of the wall , the model value @xmath126 for more absorbers , and @xmath34 increases .",
    "we have developed a number of statistical tests to use quasar absorption data to differentiate between possible models of cosmological @xmath0-variation .",
    "we confirm that a model of variation including both dipole and monopole terms is preferred , however the monopole may be an artefact due to non - terrestrial magnesium isotope ratios in the absorbers . a small change ( approximately 5% ) in the ratio of @xmath105 to @xmath108 could account for the monopole , leaving the data to be explained by a purely spatial gradient in values of @xmath0 across the universe .",
    "our robustness tests on the data showed remarkable consistency between various statistical tests : at least 40% of the data must be deleted in a heavily biased way to reduce the significance of the @xmath0-dipole to @xmath27 .",
    "an unbiased removal of 40% of the data leaves the dipole significance at around @xmath127 .",
    "this confirms that the original result , that there is evidence for a spatial gradient in values of @xmath0 at the @xmath7 level , is not due to only a few deviant points .",
    "finally we developed a genetic algorithm to find best - fit parameters for the domain wall model of @xmath0-variation suggested by  @xcite .",
    "we find that the best fit direction of the wall is not consistent with the dipole direction .",
    "this is because @xmath34 in the best - fit region is anomalously low with respect to its local neighbourhood of parameter space . on the other hand",
    "if we force the domain wall to be perpendicular to the best - fit dipole direction , the resulting @xmath34 are significantly larger than those of the dipole model .",
    "we thank c. angstmann , m.  t. murphy , j.  a. king , j.  k. webb , and f.  e. koch for useful discussions .",
    "this work is supported by the australian research council .",
    "in order to present a comparison of the significance of the models described above , we employ a similar strategy to that taken by  @xcite , generalised for our distance - dependent dipole models . the probability that we observe data @xmath128 given",
    "our model value at the @xmath39th quasar , @xmath129 , is @xmath130 where @xmath42 is the observational error and @xmath66 represents an intrinsic scatter of the true values from our model values @xmath131 .",
    "the best fit model parameters can then be found so that they maximise the log - likelihood function @xmath132 \\nonumber \\\\     & = \\sum_i \\ln \\left ( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(\\sigma^2+\\sigma_i^2 ) } } \\right )          - \\frac{(x_i-\\bar x_{i})^2}{2 ( \\sigma^2+\\sigma_i^2 ) } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : loglikelihood}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for a dipole model , @xmath129 is some function on the dipole direction and magnitude , which we represent as * l*. maximising the likelihood with respect to the model parameter gives the expression @xmath133    the covariance matrix for @xmath134 is given by @xmath135 , which will depend on the various models as follows : @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the monopole magnitude , @xmath11 is the dipole magnitude , @xmath21 is the distance to the absorber and @xmath9 is the angle between direction of the dipole and the absorber .",
    "we have taken a direct computational approach to determining the best fit model parameters . the probability that a dipole is preferred over the monopole , and hence the significance of the dipole result ,",
    "is then determined as with the method of cooke and lynden - bell .",
    "given the covariance matrix * a@xmath141 * , we have that the semiprincipal axes of the error ellipsoid for * l * are @xmath142 , where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix , respectively . the probability that the dipole should be included in the model , pr(*l * ) , is then found by integrating over the volume of the parameter space obtained by expanding or contracting the error ellipsoid such that it just encloses * l*. then @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the fraction of * l * enclosed by the error ellipsoid @xmath147 ^{1/2}\\ ] ] and @xmath68 is the error function .",
    "the standard procedure of minimising @xmath34 to find best - fit model parameters is numerically difficult for the wall model  ( [ eq : wall_model ] ) because @xmath34 is discontinuous with respect to the model parameters : @xmath34 changes in discrete steps depending on whether any given quasar absorption system is on the earth - side or far - side of the wall .",
    "this necessitates a genetic algorithm with simulated annealing to perform the fit .    in a genetic algorithm ,",
    "sets of model parameters are produced in ` generations ' with those producing the best fit ( in our cases the smallest @xmath34 ) in a particular generation retained to ` breed ' , producing the next brood of parameters . in each generation , ` mutations ' are introduced in order to produce the quasi - random variations of parameters necessary to cover the parameter space . the magnitude of such ` mutations ' are incrementally reduced in a process of simulated annealing so that the mutations become finer as parameters converge to their best fit values . as is usual when using genetic algorithms to determine best fits , several annealings are required .",
    "unusually , in this case due to the discontinuous nature of the parameter space , we not only require several annealing steps but also several cycles of sets of annealing with new ` isolated ' populations of parameters in order to avoid a situation where the entire population inhabits local minima in the parameter space .    in each cycle , we perform 5 annealing steps , as it was found that subsequent steps produced limited exploration of the parameter space due to the rapid convergence of the parameters , and that the re - initialising of genetic material in each cycle produced more efficient coverage of the parameter space . for this reason",
    ", only a single survivor is retained per cycle , to be bred with nine new randomly created populations . in each annealing step ,",
    "500 generations of model parameters are produced , with the variance scaled down with each generation .",
    "we retain 10 sets of model parameters @xmath148 per generation , with which to produce 500 offspring .",
    "we can think of these as `` vectors '' in the 4-dimensional parameter space of the wall model .",
    "the offspring have genes taken to be the average of the parent values @xmath148 and @xmath149 with an additional random term : @xmath150 where the four terms in @xmath151 are drawn randomly from a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath152 .",
    "the random scatter is reduced as the parameter values converge during the simulated annealing : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the number of generations that have been run on a given annealing . the new generation of parameter values ( parents and offspring )",
    "are then sorted by the fitness parameter @xmath155 such that the 10 parameter sets producing the largest fitness parameters are retained .",
    "after sufficient cycles ( 5 was found to be adequate ) the result is tested for convergence .",
    "the result is deemed to be converged if the algorithm has not produced a better result for four consecutive cycles .",
    "otherwise , the cycles continue .",
