    "massive stars impact many areas of astrophysics . in most galactic environments",
    "they dominate the radiative , mechanical and chemical feedback on the interstellar medium , thus regulating the evolution of galaxies .",
    "many low - mass stars form in clusters along with massive stars , and their protoplanetary disks can be affected by this feedback also .",
    "there is some evidence that our own solar system was influenced in this way ( @xcite ) . despite this importance",
    ", there is no consensus on the basic formation mechanism of massive stars .",
    "theories range from _ core accretion _",
    ", i.e. , a scaled - up version of low - mass star formation ( e.g. the turbulent core model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mt03 ) ) , to _ competitive accretion _ at the centers of forming star clusters ( @xcite , @xcite ) , to _ stellar collisions _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "the core accretion theory predicts the existence of an envelope - fed , central accretion disk and relatively ordered and collimated bipolar outflows powered by accretion around a massive protostar .",
    "the other formation mechanisms predict a much less ordered geometry of gas and dust surrounding the protostar .",
    "collimated bipolar outflows have been observed from massive protostars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "outflows may limit the formation efficiency ( mass ratio of final star to initial gravitationally - bounded protostellar core ) to @xmath70.5 ( @xcite ) , since they expel material along polar directions .",
    "the resulting low - density cavities have been proposed to significantly affect the appearance of the protostar in the mir ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and this is seen in the radiative transfer ( rt ) calculations of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zt11 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ztm13 ) using the rt code developed by @xcite .",
    "the turbulent core model also relates core properties to the surrounding self - gravitating star - cluster - forming clump . for a marginally unstable pre - stellar core of a given mass , its size , density and subsequent accretion rate",
    "all depend on the pressure set by the mean mass surface density of the clump , @xmath2 . observed values of @xmath2 are @xmath8 ( mt03 ; @xcite ) , leading to high predicted accretion rates , @xmath9 , potentially important for overcoming the high radiation pressure from the massive protostar .",
    "g35.20 - 0.74 ( hereafter g35.2 ) is a massive protostar associated with a well - defined outflow . at a distance of 2.2  kpc ( @xcite ) , radio continuum emission shows that it contains an ultracompact hii region at the center in the form of a collimated jet along the north - south direction ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which may be an example of an _ outflow - confined hii region _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "the outflow is also observed in the nir ( @xcite ) with the northern cavity brighter than the southern one .",
    "ground - based 10 and 18  @xmath0 m observations only reveal the northern cavity ( @xcite ) , suggesting it is inclined towards us .",
    "outflow is also seen in co ( @xcite , @xcite ) , including a wider angle flow in the ne - sw direction .",
    "it is unclear if this results from a separate driving source or is related to the n - s jet , but misaligned by interaction with the surrounding core / clump . in previous studies , an early b star was thought to be present at the center ( @xcite ) , surrounded by an envelope with mass @xmath10 ( @xcite ) to @xmath11 ( @xcite ) .    here",
    "we present the first sofia - forcast images of g35.2 .",
    "combined with other multiwavelength data , we construct the sed",
    ". we present a simple exploration of parameter space of rt models of massive protostars and use the observed sed and intensity profiles along the outflow axis to constrain the models .",
    "the sofia - forcast ( @xcite ) observations of g35.2 were performed on may 24 and 26 ( ut ) 2011 in the 11.3 , 19.7 , 31.5 , and 37.1  @xmath0 m filters at an altitude of 43000  ft . the chopping secondary of sofia was driven at 4  hz , with a matched chop and nod throw of 60@xmath12 , and with a nod performed every 30s .",
    "the final effective on - source exposure times were 909  s at 11.3  @xmath0 m , 959  s at 19.7  @xmath0 m , 4068  s at 31.5  @xmath0 m , and 4801  s at 37.1  @xmath0 m .",
    "the fluxes were calibrated by the sofia data reduction pipeline , which during the basic science period has an estimated 3@xmath13 calibration error in all filters ( @xcite ) .",
    "+    the 11 and 31  @xmath0 m images were observed simultaneously with the dichroic mode of forcast ; and similarly for the 19 and 37  @xmath0 m images .",
    "the relative offsets between the short and long wavelength arrays are known to better than @xmath14 .",
    "the best registration of the 19  @xmath0 m image with respect to the 18.3  @xmath0 m image from @xcite was obtained using a @xmath15 minimization algorithm .",
    "the latter was convolved with a gaussian profile to reach the same resolution of the forcast image .",
    "several features in the two images match up well after the registration increasing confidence in the technique .",
    "we adopt the pixel size ( 0.768@xmath12 ) as our conservative 1@xmath16 uncertainty in the relative offset between the 18.3 and 19.7  @xmath0 m images . considering the absolute astrometric uncertainties of @xmath17 from the 18.3  @xmath0 m image",
    ", we get an absolute astrometric uncertainty of 0.79@xmath12 from the 19.7  @xmath0 m image . the absolute astrometric uncertainty of the 37.1  @xmath0 m image is then estimated to be better than 0.8@xmath12 .",
    "however , the 11.3  @xmath0 m forcast image suffered from such low s / n that it could not be used to perform similar registration for the 31.4  @xmath0 m image .",
    "we had to use the @xmath18@xmath19 minimization algorithm to find the best registration of the 31.4  @xmath0 m image and the astrometrically calibrated 37.1  @xmath0 m image , noticing that they look remarkably similar morphologically . the absolute astrometric uncertainty in the 31.4  @xmath0 m image is estimated to be 0.89@xmath12 .",

    "the airborne forcast images have a dynamic range of @xmath20 orders of magnitude , similar to the space - based irac observations and much higher than the ground - based t - recs observations .",
    "the origin of the images is chosen to be the radio source g35.2n ( r.a.=18h58m13.033s , dec.=+1d40m36.14s ) .",

    "this cavity is also seen in the irac images , again being fainter than the northern side .",
    "this trend agrees with the results of the rt simulations by zt11 and ztm13 , which showed that at @xmath740  @xmath0 m , the near - facing outflow cavity is the dominant feature but , because of lower extinction , the structure along the outflow axis is more symmetric than at shorter wavelengths . in these models , the far - facing outflow appears in the nir mainly due to the scattering by dust in and around the outflow cavity .    with their high dynamic range",
    ", the forcast images also show extended emission on larger scales , which is missing in the ground - base mir images .",
    "the morphology of this extended emission has a resemblance to that seen with irac .",
    "this extended emission seems to be related to the cavity wall and/or a wider - angle part of the outflow .",
    "it is also possible that some , probably small , fraction of this emission is produced by other luminosity sources .",
    "we integrated over a @xmath21 region to find total 31 and 37  @xmath0 m fluxes of 527 and 922  jy , respectively .",
    "no significant emission was seen outside of this area in either band .",

    "total 2mass and irac fluxes were integrated from background - subtracted images in the same region as the forcast bands .",
    "the 10 and 18  @xmath0 m fluxes ( 3.06 and 46.87  jy , @xcite ) were integrated with a 30@xmath12 aperture ( again , there are no significant sources in the immediate vicinity ) . for iras bands ,",
    "the beams are so large that the @xmath21 region does not contain all the flux from this source , so we use larger apertures ( @xmath22 ) that encircle all the emission from the source while avoiding fluxes from significant nearby sources .",
    "we obtained fluxes at 60 and 100  @xmath0 m of @xmath23 and @xmath24  jy .",
    "they may be considered as upper limits . for spire and scuba images ,",
    "we have carefully subtracted the backgrounds with two or more component gaussian fitting .",

    "the sed is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "we use the sed to constrain the properties of the protostar , its core and the surrounding clump by fitting with the rt models of zt11 and ztm13 .",
    "the models are developed self - consistently for a core embedded in a high pressure clump forming a massive star via core accretion ( mt03 ) , including a treatment of rotating infall , an active accretion disk and a disk wind filling the outflow cavity .",
    "we have further extended the ztm13 models to also include emission from the surrounding clump ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "since we have not yet constructed a full model grid , we limit ourselves to achieving only a moderately good fit by exploring the parameters manually and with a quite coarse sampling of parameter space .",
    "we show four models that have relatively good matches to the sed in fig .",
    "( [ fig : sed ] ) with their parameters listed in tab .",
    "( [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "model 1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) contains a core of initial mass @xmath28 , and a protostar of mass @xmath29 forming at its center .",
    "the core is embedded in a clump with @xmath30 , thus setting its radius @xmath31  pc ( mt03 ) .",
    "we distribute the clump material between 1 and @xmath32 with a power - law density profile ( with index of -1.75 , e.g. , @xcite ) that joins the core boundary smoothly and reaches @xmath33 by @xmath32 ( counting two sides along a central sight line ) .",
    "then the original clump mass ( assuming spherical symmetry , i.e. before some material is swept - up by the outflow ) is @xmath34 . the size of the disk is set by assuming a ratio of rotational to gravitational energy of 2% , yielding an outer radius of 940  au .",
    "its mass is assumed to be 1/3 of the stellar mass .",
    "the accretion rate is @xmath35 .",
    "the total luminosity is @xmath36 including protostar , accretion boundary layer and disk .",
    "an outflow cavity , filled with a disk wind , including dust along streamlines launched from the cooler disk outside of 7  au , is included .",
    "following zt11 and ztm13 , the cavity opening angle , @xmath37 , to yield a final star formation efficiency from the core of 50% .",
    "the viewing angle between the sight line and the outflow axis is @xmath38 . at this viewing angle ,",
    "if the received flux was assumed to be isotropic then a bolometric luminosity of @xmath39 would be implied . after considering the foreground extinction as a free parameter to better",
    "fit the nir data ( @xmath40  mag for model 1 ) and applying an appropriate aperture size ( @xmath41 ) , the inferred isotropic bolometric luminosity based on the received flux becomes @xmath42 .",
    "three other models with smaller values of @xmath2 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are also shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : sed ] ) ( see also table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "overall , good agreement is achieved between these model seds and the observations .",
    "small discrepancies in the nir and irac bands may be due to patchy extinction and/or poorly - modeled polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features and/or thermal emission from transiently heated small dust grains . at 60  @xmath0 m the observed iras flux is lower than the model ( after convolving with the relatively broad filter response of iras 60  @xmath0 m band ) by @xmath725% .",
    "these results show the sed fitting has a certain degeneracy in model parameter space , especially when the opening angle is not well constrained ( ztm13 found the outflow , especially the bright part , at 10 to 20  @xmath0 m appears narrower than the actual cavity , so the mir morphology may not be a reliable tracer of the total outflow opening angle ) .",
    "models with narrower outflow cavities reprocess larger fractions of their luminosities and thus have smaller bolometric flashlight effect corrections for the considered viewing angles .",
    "thus lower luminosity protostars are able to reproduce the observed fir peak of the sed .",
    "then , lower values of @xmath2 and @xmath44 are needed to match the mir fluxes .",
    "observations at 10  @xmath0 m with higher spectral resolution will provide strong diagnostics for testing these models .",
    "however , even with a large uncertainty in the outflow opening angle , the protostellar mass is still estimated to be @xmath45 and @xmath46 , i.e. , g35.2 is a massive protostar forming from a massive core embedded in a high surface density clump .",
    "the images of model 1 are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : cartoon ] ) for reference .",
    "the other three models selected from sed fitting show slightly narrower outflow cavities .",
    "we compare the intensity distribution along the outflow axis predicted by these models with observations in fig .",
    "( [ fig : fluxdist ] ) ) .",
    "the axis direction of g35.2 is chosen via the radio continuum and mir morphology ( dashed line in fig .",
    "( [ fig : img ] ) with p.a . of @xmath47 ) .",
    "the model profiles are all convolved with the corresponding instrument beams . at each",
    "offset from the center , we average over a perpendicular width of 2@xmath12 to estimate profiles for both model and data .",
    "all model and observed profiles are normalized to the average values over the near - facing regions that have significant emission .",
    "we also add constant background ambient intensities , which may be either due to instrumental noise ( i.e. in the t - recs data ) or from additional ambient interstellar material .",
    "note we have not attempted to use the lateral width of the cavities to constrain the models    we emphasize that a detailed model search to fit these profiles separately from the sed has not been performed , but still model 1 agrees very well with the observations at 37 , 31 , 18 and 10  @xmath0 m , producing the right peak positions and asymmetries of the two sides of the outflow . at 10  @xmath0",
    "m , model 1 predicts higher extinction towards the center . a possible explanation could be the strength ( depth and width ) of the silicate absorption feature adopted in the dust model used in the rt calculations ( ztm13 ) . in the irac bands , while a reasonable fit is achieved for the near - facing outflow cavity , the intensities of the far - facing side predicted by the model are too low compared to those observed .",
    "possible reasons for this include : ( 1 ) non - uniform , possibly patchy , extinction from the clump or the adopted uniform `` foreground '' extinction , that may actually be relatively local to the source ( e.g. a foreground extinction of @xmath48 lowers 3.6  @xmath0 m flux by a factor of two ) ; ( 2 ) enhanced emission from pahs and transiently - heated small dust grains in and around the outflow cavity . models 2 , 3 and 4 also have good matches with the data in the near - facing and far - facing wings at 37 , 31 , 18 and 10  @xmath0 m , but their profiles become too peaked towards the center due to the lower extinction of their lower @xmath49 cores and clumps .",
    "these results , especially the intensity profiles for model 1 from @xmath50 m ( for which the modeling has potentially fewer problems associated with small grain and pah emission ) , again support the paradigm that g35.2 is a massive protostar forming from a high @xmath49 core and clump .",
    "the match of the sed and intensity profiles with observations becomes less good when @xmath2 becomes lower .",
    "we estimate that @xmath2 should be no lower than @xmath51 .",
    "the profiles also suggest that the accretion flow and outflows are relatively well - ordered and symmetric .",
    "sofia - forcast provides imaging with high dynamic range similar to space - based instruments at a unique wavelength region @xmath730 to 40  @xmath0 m , where lower extinction allows us to search for the predicted ( zt11 , ztm13 ) far - facing outflow cavity from a massive protostar forming from a high surface density core . at longer wavelengths",
    "the emission is predicted to become even more symmetric , being dominated by cooler dust in the core / clump .",
    "our sofia - forcast observations at 31 and 37  @xmath0 m did reveal emission from the far - facing outflow cavity of g35.2 , which was too faint to detect by ground - based t - recs 11 and 18  @xmath0 m observations .",
    "we compiled the nir to mm sed of g35.2 .",
    "rt modeling of a massive protostar forming from a massive core bounded by a high @xmath49 clump gave good agreement with this sed for four models .",
    "depending on the outflow cavity opening angle ( 35@xmath52 to 50@xmath52 ) , we found @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "model 1 also produced intensity profiles along the outflow axis that fit the observations well at 10 , 18 , 31 and 37  @xmath0 m , without need for extensive fine tuning .",
    "these results indicate g35.2 is a massive protostar , forming from high surface density core and clump , via relatively ordered , symmetric collapse and accretion .",
    "powerful bipolar outflows are being launched and have cleared wide - angle cavities , that are also relatively symmetric .",
    "a protostar with the luminosity estimated here ( @xmath56 ) is expected to drive a co outflow with momentum flux of @xmath57 ( @xcite ) , which is much larger than the observed value : even assuming that the larger ne - sw co outflow is also driven by this source , the total momentum flux is still only @xmath58 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this may indicate that the outflow from g35.2n , being partly ionized as indicated by the observed radio continuum jet , may be relatively deficient in co emission .",
    "note that the modest misalignment of the larger co outflow with the radio and mir jet may result from the interaction of the wider angle part of the outflow with a core / clump that does have some moderate lateral asymmetries .",
    "we conclude that , at least in the case of g35.2 , massive star formation appears to be well described by predictions of the turbulent core model ( mt03 ) , even with a highly idealized realization of the model utilizing perfect axissymmetry and smooth density structures ( see @xcite for a numerical simulation of this model including outflows ) . such ordered accretion and outflow",
    "is not expected in models involving massive star formation via competitive accretion or stellar collisions , nor indeed in cores that are highly turbulent .",
    "this may indicate that magnetic fields are dynamically important in setting the structure of the core .",

    "<S> one of these models also has excellent agreement with the observed intensity profiles along the outflow axis at 10 , 18 , 31 and 37  @xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> overall our results support a model of massive star formation involving the relatively ordered , symmetric collapse of a massive , dense core and the launching bipolar outflows that clear low density cavities . </S>",
    "<S> thus a unified model may apply for the formation of both low and high mass stars . </S>"
