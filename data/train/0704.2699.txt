    "the use of complex networks and graph theory to describe complex systems ranging from the www to protein interaction networks is by now well - established ( different book and reviews are available about this topic @xcite ) .",
    "a large class of these systems attains complexity by means of their internal dynamics @xcite , which is often revealed by computer simulations .",
    "one example of such systems is the folding of proteins for which simulations have been extensively used in structural biology . nowadays",
    "several molecular dynamics ( md ) softwares ( charmm  @xcite , gromacs  @xcite , amber  @xcite ) are available to probe in real time the dynamics of folding / unfolding . however , because of the large number of degrees of freedom @xcite involved in the process , the results of md simulations form themselves a highly complex system . as a consequence a detailed , unbiased description of the free - energy landscape underlying the thermodynamics and kinetics can not not easily be extracted .    to tackle this complexity , new approaches based on complex networks",
    "have been recently introduced showing that a network description is effective for the analysis and visualization of simulation results . in @xcite for instance , the topology of the configurations of a short lattice polymer has been mapped onto a network .",
    "doye and massen have also applied graph analysis to study the organization of the potential energy minima in a lennard - jones cluster of atoms @xcite.in another work the concept of disconnectivity graphs has been used to analyze the free - energy of a tetrapeptide and a @xmath0-hairpin @xcite .",
    "finally the free - energy landscape of a three - stranded @xmath0-sheet ( beta3s ) and alanine dipeptide sampled by md simulations have been represented as a configuration space network ( csn ) @xcite .",
    "given the time evolution of a dynamical system , the csn represents the ensemble of micro - states ( configurations ) sampled during a simulation , and their dynamic connectivity . in this representation , nodes are system configurations and links are direct transitions between the configurations sampled during the simulation .",
    "the csn topology shares several features with other networks representing systems as different as cell function @xcite , scientific collaborations @xcite and the www @xcite .",
    "in particular it has been shown @xcite that the degree distribution of the beta3s peptide csn exhibits a heavy tail well approximated by a power - law and a disassortative behavior for the average neighbor connectivity distribution . moreover",
    "the clustering coefficient presents a decay compatible with a @xmath1 function for large values of the degree , which has been interpreted as the presence of a hierarchical organization of the nodes @xcite .",
    "recently , the connection between the csn topological clusters and free - energy basins has been explored and an analytical solution for the node weight distribution observed in csns has been provided with the help of simple energy landscape models @xcite .",
    "following these lines of research , the challenge is now to find the connection between network topology , system dynamics and free - energy landscape organization .",
    "this work focuses on the degree distribution @xmath2 , the average neighbor connectivity @xmath3 and the clustering coefficient @xmath4 observed in csns .",
    "several studies @xcite have shown that the analysis of the above three distributions is an important step towards the understanding of the network organization and architecture .",
    "the results presented below provide the first rationale for the origin of several unexplained properties of csns .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes in detail how csns are built .",
    "section iii shows how the degree distribution , the average neighbor degree and the clustering coefficient relate to the free - energy landscape . in section",
    "iv an analytical derivation and simulation results are presented for the quadratic well model .",
    "then the csns obtained from beta3s peptide and lattice heteropolymer simulations are analyzed in section v. finally , the connection between csns and the fitness model is discussed in section vi and conclusions are presented in section vii .",
    "the simulation of a dynamical system , like a peptide or a protein , results in a time series of snapshots representing the dynamics .",
    "the csn of this kind of processes gives a synthetic view of the configurations and transitions observed during the simulation .",
    "system configurations are the nodes and a link is placed between two nodes if they appear consecutively in the time series .",
    "the time step between two snapshots @xmath5 ( usually called configuration saving time ) is a free parameter : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the integration time step for the simulation and @xmath8 is the number of microscopic steps between two snapshots .",
    "when @xmath8 approaches 1 , only configurations spatially close to each other are connected together . therefore a link is a temporal relation between configurations and changing @xmath8 changes the set of links .",
    "the weight of a link @xmath9 represents the number of direct transitions from node @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , the weight @xmath12 of a node is given by the number of times a configuration has been visited .",
    "the weight distribution of csn has been discussed in a previous work @xcite .",
    "the degree of a node is defined as the number of links including loops ( edges to itself ) , corresponding to the number of configurations accessed in @xmath8 steps during the dynamics .",
    "because of finite - time simulations , the csn is a directed network : if the system visited node @xmath11 @xmath8 steps after node @xmath10 , the converse is not automatically true . hence @xmath13 and @xmath14 are not always equal",
    "however , the asymmetry of the links is weak for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the simulation is run long enough to almost ensure @xmath15 ( which is in fact equivalent to detailed balance ) .",
    "secondly , the total weight of the incoming links has to be equal to the total weight of the outgoing links by construction of the network .    in the following",
    ", the degree of a node , @xmath16 , is defined as the out - degree @xmath17 .",
    "similarly the average neighbor degree @xmath3 is the average out - degree of the neighbors of the nodes with degree @xmath18 .",
    "the out - degree correlation between connected nodes is further characterized by the assortativity coefficient @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "finally the clustering coefficient is computed as the total number of 3-steps cycles ( triangles ) starting at node @xmath10 ( @xmath20 ) , divided by the maximum number of 3-steps cycles one can have in the considered graph : @xmath21 .",
    "as already mentioned the ultimate goal is to understand the relation between the network topology and the free - energy landscape .",
    "unfortunately the degree of a node for instance can not be computed from the knowledge of the energy landscape for any @xmath8 . however , large values of @xmath8 correspond to a random sampling of the landscape ( uncorrelated exploration ) . in this case",
    "an analytical approach can be carried out . the probability density on the free - energy landscape",
    "is given by @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 ( in @xmath24 units ) is the multi - dimensional energy potential and @xmath25 the correct normalization .",
    "as shown further in this article , uncorrelated exploration of the free - energy landscape is relevant for several simulation procedures . in the space @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the dimension of the landscape , the system configurations ( i.e. , csn nodes ) are defined as hyper - cubic cells of size @xmath28 .",
    "the probability to visit a configuration at @xmath29 at a given time is @xmath30 and the expected number of times two configurations at position @xmath29 and @xmath31 are visited consecutively is given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the total number of snapshots and @xmath35 is chosen small enough , such that @xmath36 is almost constant on each cell .",
    "the expression above predicts link weights . to compute the degree ,",
    "the quantity of interest is the probability @xmath37 to have a link between two configurations ( no matter how often the link has been visited ) . assuming that the probability distribution of visiting @xmath38 times the node at @xmath39 is peaked around its average value @xmath40 , @xmath37 is evaluated as one minus the probability to have no links : @xmath41 where the second equality holds in the limit of small @xmath42 , which is true if the number of configurations is large .",
    "@xmath43 is the expected number of times the configuration at @xmath44 has been visited and @xmath45 is the probability not to visit the configuration at @xmath46 .",
    "[ start ] is an approximation .",
    "an exact expression would require to sum the probability of visiting @xmath38 times node @xmath44 multiplied by the probability of never visiting @xmath46 right after @xmath44 , i.e @xmath47 , excluding the cases in which @xmath44 has been visited several times consecutively .",
    "however it is very difficult to express this in a simple form , and approximations are needed to proceed with further analytical calculations . from eq .",
    "[ start ] , two asymptotic behaviors can be derived :    1 .",
    "if @xmath48 is large , then @xmath49 .",
    "this is the _ saturation regime _ since @xmath44 and @xmath46 are almost certainly connected 2 .   if @xmath48 is small , the _ sparse regime _ is reached which describes low probability connections . in this regime",
    "a @xmath50 expansion is meaningful : @xmath51^j(-1)^{j+1 } \\label{taylor}\\ ] ]    the first term in eq .",
    "[ taylor ] is equal to @xmath52 in eq .",
    "[ wij ] . taking only the first term in the sum corresponds to the case in which links are distributed avoiding as much as possible the presence of double links .",
    "if @xmath53 it provides a good approximation of the sum , while for @xmath54 it slightly overestimates the real probability to have a link between two nodes .",
    "applying the considerations above , an approximation of @xmath37 is given by : @xmath55 \\label{unif}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "[ unif ] defines a probability to have a link between two nodes , depending only on a parameter associated with each node ( in this case the energy @xmath56 ) .",
    "such systems have been first described as the fitness model in @xcite and generalized in @xcite ( see section vi ) .",
    "the degree of a node at @xmath57 , its average neighbor degree and the expected number of triangles the node is part of are then given by the following three expressions : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60    finally , assuming continuous approximation , the degree distribution reads :    @xmath61    inverting eq . [ deg ] and inserting it into eq .",
    "[ knn ] and eq .",
    "[ tr ] gives the average neighbor connectivity @xmath3 and the clustering coefficient @xmath4 , respectively : @xmath62 @xmath63",
    "in general the free - energy landscapes of real systems are extremely complex , so that even writing down a mathematical expression is often impossible . however , close to the minimum of a basin ( corresponding to configurations visited several times ) , such systems can often be approximately described by means of a taylor expansion of the potential , whose first term is harmonic .",
    "therefore the quadratic well is a good benchmark to understand more complex csns @xcite , in particular for nodes near the minimum of an energy basin . in 2 dimensions ,",
    "the potential is given by : @xmath64 using radial coordinates and introducing eq .",
    "[ uxy ] in eq .",
    "[ unif ] with @xmath65 gives ( @xmath66 ) : @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",

    "[ distr ] ( see appendix for the complete derivation ) : @xmath72 note that the flat tail for @xmath73 is an artifact of the continuous approximation in @xmath74 .",

    "there is a change in the behavior of @xmath3 as @xmath8 increases . for low values of @xmath8 @xmath3",

    "for @xmath88 the curves can not be distinguished from the one obtained with uncorrelated sampling .",
    "the flat region for small @xmath18 arises because nodes with small degree are likely to be connected with nodes with high degree which lay at the bottom of the basin .",
    "this phenomenon reflects that for large @xmath8 , transitions starting at a node far from the minimum are likely to end up at the bottom of the basin , which is characterized by nodes with a large degree . on the other hand , for small values of @xmath8",
    "only neighbor configurations are visited consecutively .    as already pointed out",

    "although models with changing assortativity have been recently proposed @xcite this is the first time to our knowledge that a family of networks underlying the same physical process , i.e. diffusion in a well , presents this kind of transition .    in the same way ,",

    "however as @xmath8 increases , all distributions overlap ( up to a global multiplicative factor ) indicating that the kinetics to the bottom is the same for all configurations ( see fig .",

    "the md simulation of the native state of beta3s is performed at 270 k for a total of 10 ns of simulation time which is enough for the correct sampling of the basin .",

    "the time series of configurations is generated from moves of the polymer according to the metropolis rule .",
    "it is important to mention that the qualitative observations do not depend on the set of moves ( local moves and the global `` pivot '' moves @xcite have been tested ) . in the standard hp model",

    ", the cornerstone of the simulation is the appropriate adjustment of @xmath103 in order to achieve an effective sampling of the lowest energy configurations .",
    "this has been accomplished by sampling at a temperature significantly smaller than the coil - to - globule transition temperature of the polymer ( i.e. @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) .",

    "the distributions are robust upon varying the configuration saving time ( i.e. changing the value of @xmath8 ) and resemble a power - law @xmath107 for @xmath108 with exponent @xmath78 between 1.5 and 2 .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively similar to what is observed for the quadratic well while the steeper slope may result from the higher dimension ( i.e. , higher number of degrees of freedom ) of the energy landscapes .",

    "the clustering coefficient @xmath4 converges towards a general decreasing behavior for large @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ topo.fig]c and [ mfcor]c ) . in a previous work",
    ", the presence of an apparent scaling in @xmath4 had been interpreted as the signature of a hierarchical organization of the nodes in the native state of beta3s @xcite . however , a comparison between the @xmath4 of beta3s for different values of @xmath8 and of the quadratic well ( see fig .",
    "[ fcor ] ) strongly suggest that this decay does not indicate node hierarchy as presented in @xcite .",
    "firstly , the quadratic well underlying the csn does not present a hierarchical organization like in @xcite . secondly , it should be noticed that in the uncorrelated regime nodes laying at the bottom of the basin are connected together , giving rise to an almost complete subgraph . in this regime , nodes with low degree",
    "are unlikely to be connected together but tend to connect to high degree nodes ( bottom configurations ) .",

    "finally , it is important to note that these results have been obtained for csns originating from a single basin energy landscape . in the case of networks describing fully sampled landscapes presenting a large number of basins the network topology reflects the contributions from different basins .",
    "the scaling behavior observed in several networks has triggered a vast effort in modeling complex networks @xcite .",
    "of particular interest for csn is the model based on a fitness parameter on the nodes @xcite . in the original fitness model @xcite",

    "<S> the configuration space network ( csn ) of a dynamical system is an effective approach to represent the ensemble of configurations sampled during a simulation and their dynamic connectivity . to elucidate the connection between the csn topology and the underlying free - energy landscape governing the system dynamics and thermodynamics , an analytical solution is provided to explain the heavy tail of the degree distribution , neighbor connectivity and clustering coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> this derivation allows to understand the universal csn network topology observed in systems ranging from a simple quadratic well to the native state of the beta3s peptide and a 2d lattice heteropolymer . </S>",
    "<S> moreover csn are shown to fall in the general class of complex networks described by the fitness model . </S>"
