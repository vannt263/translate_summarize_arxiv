    "in the final stages of their evolution , stars of main - sequence masses @xmath70.88 m@xmath2 ascend the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "the end - product of their evolution is a white dwarf , with a typical mass of @xmath80.5 m@xmath2 .",
    "it is thus clear that near the tip of the agb , stars must be losing most of their mass .",
    "the rate at which this occurs is estimated to be @xmath9 to @xmath10 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 , much faster than the nuclear burning mass consumption rate which normally determines the rate of stellar evolution ( van loon et al .",
    "hence the mass loss is important for the subsequent evolution of the star , as well as for the chemical enrichment of the inter - stellar medium . yet",
    "our knowledge and understanding of the mass - loss mechanism and the composition of the mass lost is incomplete .    amongst",
    "the key factors in supporting a dense outflow from an agb star are the low effective temperature , which allows for the formation of circum - stellar dust , and the high luminosity , which , through radiation pressure on the dust grains and collissional coupling between the dust and the gas , drives a stellar wind .",
    "because the dust only forms at several stellar radii from the star , there has to be an additional mechanism to bring the gas into the dust formation region  possibly provided by strong radial pulsations ( e.g.bowen & willson 1991 ) .",
    "dynamical models for the circumstellar envelopes of agb stars suggest that the mass - loss rate depends strongly on the stellar effective temperature , about @xmath11 ( arndt , fleischer & sedlmayr 1997 ) .",
    "although this seems to be confirmed for the onset of the dusty mass - loss epoch ( alard et al .",
    "2001 ) , it is not clear whether such strong temperature dependence is also valid during the so - called `` superwind '' phase where the agb star is obscured by its optically thick circum - stellar envelope ( van loon et al .",
    "1999b ) .",
    "a dramatic change in the chemical composition of the mass lost occurs when an agb star becomes a carbon star ( iben & renzini 1983 ) : during the temporal ignition of a helium - burning shell , situated in between the degenerate carbon / oxygen core and the hydrogen - burning shell , the convective mantle may reach the nuclear burning layer and transport nuclear burning products to the stellar surface ( @xmath12 dredge - up ) .",
    "these thermal pulses ( tp ) occur on timescales of @xmath13@xmath14 yr , and last only briefly . but over the course of tp - agb evolution , the surface abundance of carbon may exceed that of oxygen , forming a carbon star . due to the strong binding of the co molecule ,",
    "only the remaining oxygen or carbon is used to synthesize other molecules that nucleate to form dust grains in the circum - stellar envelope .",
    "hence the circum - stellar chemistry of carbon stars is fundamentally different from that of oxygen - rich agb stars .",
    "there is a threshold mass above which @xmath12 dredge - up is strong enough to make a carbon star , roughly at @xmath15 m@xmath2 and mildly dependent on metallicity ( marigo , girardi & bressan 1999 ) .",
    "however , in massive agb stars , about @xmath16 m@xmath2 , nuclear burning occurs within the bottom layers of the convective mantle , converting the carbon into nitrogen : hot bottom burning ( hbb ) . at the very end of agb evolution ,",
    "the diminished mantle mass as a result of prolonged mass loss causes hbb to cease , and a final thermal pulse may turn the star into a carbon star after all ( frost et al .",
    "these competing processes are likely to depend on the initial metallicity of the star .",
    "optical studies of the agb population in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) provide support for the @xmath12 dredge - up and hbb to govern the formation of carbon stars ( e.g.  groenewegen & de jong 1993 ; marigo et al .",
    "recent infrared ( ir ) studies could assess the effects of mass loss and possible observational bias in optical studies .",
    "these studies confirm the delayed formation of massive carbon stars after cessation of hbb , but also suggest that amongst agb stars in the superwind phase oxygen - rich stars exist with masses below the threshold for hbb ( zijlstra et al .",
    "1996 ; van loon et al .  1997 , 1998 , 1999b ; van loon , zijlstra & groenewegen 1999a ) .",
    "much of the uncertainty with respect to the progenitor mass and initial metallicity of an individual agb star can be alleviated if the star is a member of a co - eval stellar cluster .",
    "optical studies provide a great number of such examples in lmc and smc clusters , confirming the mass - range for optically bright carbon stars between @xmath1711.5 and @xmath1835 m@xmath2 ( frogel , mould & blanco 1990 ; marigo , girardi & chiosi 1996 ; van loon 2002 ) .",

    "the spatial resolution of these maps is insufficient to detect differences in reddening over a few arcminutes , and therefore uniform reddening is assumed for the region within a radius of @xmath41 around kmhk 1603 .",

    "however , the metallicity of li - lmc 1813 is @xmath2535 times less than solar ( section 3 ) . as the gas - to - dust ratio scales inversely proportional to the metallicity ( van loon 2000 )",
    ", we expect @xmath138300 to 500 in the dust shell of li - lmc 1813 .",
    "hence we estimate the mass - loss rate of li - lmc 1813 to be @xmath3 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 .",
    "li - lmc 1813 is a carbon star . with its",

    "2001 ) to raise the photospheric abundance of carbon to above that of oxygen .",
    "the observed high @xmath104 ratio can be explained in terms of its low metallicity and relatively high mass as compared to carbon stars in the solar neighbourhood that have generally low - mass progenitors of @xmath140 m@xmath2 ( see marigo 2002 , her fig .",
    "it also suggests that li - lmc 1813 has been a carbon star for already quite some time .",
    "li - lmc 1813 is indeed a highly evolved agb star .",
    "the isochrones that yield the mass estimate ( based upon the colour - magnitude diagram of the cluster stars ) for li - lmc 1813 also indicate that its luminosity places it at the very tip of its evolution along the agb .",
    "its luminosity of @xmath1 l@xmath2 is a few times brighter than the peak in the optically bright carbon star luminosity function ( groenewegen 2002 ) , but the same as the peak in the dust - enshrouded carbon star luminosity function ( van loon et al .",
    "this is not unexpected , as the duration of the tp - agb is longest for stars in the range @xmath222 to 2.5 m@xmath2 ( marigo 2001 ) .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that li - lmc 1813 is in the superwind phase , experiencing mass loss at a tremendous rate of @xmath29 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 .",
    "schrder , winters & sedlmayr ( 1999 ) show that low - mass carbon stars , with @xmath141 m@xmath2 , expell thick shells during a brief period of enhanced luminosity as a result of a thermal pulse , but that more massive carbon stars such as li - lmc 1813 suffer a longer period of a persistently high mass - loss rate .",
    "our analysis of li - lmc 1813 provides direct evidence for this superwind to occur at the _ tip _ of the agb .    vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) model tp - agb evolution including a prescription for the mass - loss rate based on empirical data for galactic mira variables .",
    "they argue that the maximum mass - loss rate during the superwind phase is set by the transfer of momentum from the stellar radiation field onto the outflowing matter : @xmath142 , independent of the metallicity or chemical composition .",
    "their prediction for the mass - loss rate of @xmath143@xmath144 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 during the superwind experienced by stars with @xmath1452.5 m@xmath2 is three times lower than the actual observed mass - loss rate of li - lmc 1813 .",
    "however , gail & sedlmayr ( 1986 ) have argued that multiple scattering can enhance the transfer of momentum and thus increase the maximum mass - loss rate , which was confirmed by observations of dust - enshrouded agb stars in the lmc ( van loon et al.1999b ) .",
    "wachter et al .  (",
    "2002 ) derive a formula for the mass - loss rate of solar - metallicity carbon stars , based on dynamical models : @xmath146 . according to this formula",
    ", the mass - loss rate of li - lmc 1813 is predicted to be @xmath147 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 for @xmath148 k. this agrees extremely well with the observed mass - loss rate of @xmath3 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 .",
    "considering that the metallicity of li - lmc 1813 is three to five times lower than solar , the good agreement between the actual mass - loss rate of li - lmc 1813 and the prediction for its mass - loss rate at solar metallicity suggests that the mass - loss rate  at least during the superwind phase  does not strongly depend on metallicity ( see van loon 2000 ) .",
    "in her new calculations for agb evolution and the formation of carbon stars , marigo ( 2002 ) includes the effects of molecule formation within the stellar atmosphere .",
    "one of the differences between these and previous models is that the @xmath149 drops once molecules are being formed , leading to high mass - loss rates of several @xmath150 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4 at @xmath151 for carbon stars of @xmath152 m@xmath2 .",
    "the observed insensitivity of @xmath130 to the initial metallicity may , in the case of carbon stars , be due to enhanced formation of carbonaceous molecules as a result of a higher @xmath104 ratio at lower metallicity .",
    "alternatively , metallicity insensitivity of the pulsation mechanism has been suggested as a possible reason for the metallicity insensitivity of the mass - loss rate during the superwind phase ( van loon 2002 ) .",
    "when an agb star arrives on the mira period - luminosity ( p - l ) sequence , its mass - loss rate has become so severe that further evolution is along tracks of constant luminosity , with the radius ( and hence pulsation period ) growing as the structure of the mantle re - adjusts itself to the decrease in mass ( e.g.wood 1998 ) .",
    "describing the mira as a polytrope , @xmath153{m}=constant$ ] , and the pulsation as a harmonic oscillator , @xmath154 , the period evolves as @xmath155 ( van loon 2002 ) .",
    "if li - lmc 1813 has evolved from @xmath24400 d on the mira p - l ( @xmath139 m@xmath2 ) to @xmath24680 d at present , it has a current mass of only @xmath156 m@xmath2 . according to marigo ( 2001 ) , its final",
    "mass will become @xmath157 m@xmath2 .",
    "this means that , although it has already lost @xmath1580.9 m@xmath2 , it must still lose another @xmath1580.7 m@xmath2 .",
    "stars of @xmath28 m@xmath2 with correspondingly long periods ( @xmath241500 d ) have not ( yet ) been found , the longest known period for such star being @xmath24900 d ( wood 1998 ) .",
    "this is not surprising , as it would perhaps take as little as @xmath118 yr to lose the remainder of the stellar mantle , rendering these objects extremely rare .",
    "as a result of a large observational effort , the mid - ir point source li - lmc 1813 is now one of the few agb stars experiencing the superwind phase of intense mass loss for which the progenitor mass , initial metallicity , atmospheric chemistry , luminosity and mass - loss rate are accurately known .",
    "it thus provides an important testcase against which to gauge models for the evolution and mass - loss of agb stars .",
    "absorption features due to carbonaceous molecules in the near - ir spectra of li - lmc 1813 indicate that it is a carbon star . from its location in the lmc cluster kmhk 1603 ,",
    "its progenitor mass is inferred to be @xmath28 m@xmath2 , which is typical for a carbon star , whilst its initial metallicity is three to five times lower than solar .",
    "the object is heavily obscured by its circumstellar dust , which shines brightly at ir wavelengths . from the modelling of the spectral energy distribution , a mass - loss rate of @xmath29 m@xmath2 yr@xmath4",
    "is estimated .",
    "this is very high , especially for such metal - poor star .",
    "as the luminosity of li - lmc 1813 ( @xmath1 l@xmath2 ) places it at the very tip of its agb , this observation provides direct evidence for the superwind to represent the final episode in the agb evolution .",
    "although the observed mass - loss rate for li - lmc 1813 is a few times higher than that predicted by the formalism in vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) , it is in very good agreement with the prescription based on the dynamical models of wachter et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for _ solar _ metallicity .",
    "this suggests that the mass - loss rate in the superwind phase may be metallicity insensitive ( van loon 2000 , 2002 ) , perhaps because of a larger abundance of carbonaceous molecules other than carbon - monoxide in metal - poor stellar atmospheres ( matsuura et al.2002 ; marigo 2002 ) .",
