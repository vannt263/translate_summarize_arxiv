    "ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ; fm00 ; paper i ) demonstrated a tight correlation between the masses of supermassive black holes ( bhs ) and the velocity dispersions of their host bulges , @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the scatter in the relation was found to be consistent with that expected on the basis of measurement errors alone ; in other words , the underlying correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is essentially perfect .",
    "the relation is apparently so tight that it surpasses in predictive accuracy what can be achieved from detailed dynamical modelling of stellar kinematical data in most galaxies . as an example",
    ", fm00 showed that the bh mass estimates of magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , derived from ground - based optical observations , lie systematically above the @xmath0 relation defined by galaxies with secure bh masses , some by as much as two orders of magnitude .",
    "the @xmath0 relation of paper i was based on central velocity dispersions @xmath8 , corrected to an effective aperture of radius @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the half - light radius .",
    "central velocity dispersions are easily measured and available for a large number of galaxies ( prugniel et al .",
    "an alternative form of the @xmath0 relation was investigated by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000a ; g00 ) who used @xmath11 as the independent variable ; @xmath11 was defined as the spatially - averaged , rms , line - of - sight stellar velocity within the effective radius @xmath10 .",
    "computing @xmath11 requires knowledge of the stellar rotation and velocity dispersion profiles at all radii within @xmath10 , as well as information about the inclination of the rotation axis with respect to the line of sight .",
    "these data are available for a smaller number of galaxies ; on the other hand , @xmath11 might be expected to reflect the depth of the stellar potential well more accurately than @xmath8 .",
    "the versions of the @xmath12 relation derived by fm00 and by g00 differ in two important ways .",
    "the latter authors found a significantly smaller slope ( @xmath13 vs. @xmath14 ) as well as a greater vertical scatter ",
    "greater both in an absolute sense , and relative to measurement errors in @xmath7 .",
    "g00 estimated that approximately @xmath15 of the scatter in @xmath7 about the mean line was intrinsic and the remainder due to measurement errors .",
    "fm00 found no evidence for an intrinsic scatter in @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath0 relation is currently our best guide to bh demographics , and it is important to understand the source of these differences . that is the goal of this paper .",
    "in addition to using different measures of the velocity dispersion , fm00 and g00 analyzed different galaxy samples , and used different algorithms for fitting regression lines to the data . we find that regression algorithms that account correctly for errors in the measured variables always give a steeper slope than that found by g00 .",
    "we also show that the steeper relation derived by fm00 provides a better fit to galaxies with bh masses computed by reverberation mapping .",
    "table 1 gives the data used here .",
    "the first 12 galaxies ( sample 1 ) are `` sample a '' from paper i , consisting of those galaxies with published bh mass estimates that were deemed reliable  roughly speaking , galaxies in which the sphere of influence of the bh has been resolved .",
    "five of these masses are derived from stellar kinematics and seven from gas dynamics .",
    "all of these galaxies were included in the g00 sample as well , with the exception of ngc 3115 ; for this galaxy , we assume @xmath16 .",
    "the second part of table 1 contains the additional 15 galaxies included by g00 ( sample 2).@xmath17 most of the bh mass estimates for these galaxies are based on unpublished stis data .",
    "in addition , g00 included m31 and ngc 1068 , which were excluded from paper i on the grounds that their bh masses were deemed unreliable .",
    "we computed distances for the g00 galaxies in table 1 in the same way as in paper i and corrected the bh masses accordingly .",
    "we also computed aperture - corrected central dispersions @xmath8 for the g00 galaxies .",
    "at this point , we are already in a position to test the idea , proposed by g00 , that the steeper slope of the @xmath18 relation in paper i is due to spuriously high values of @xmath8 for the more nearby galaxies .",
    "this idea is rejected based on figure 1 , which shows that there is remarkably little difference on average between @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is presumably due to the flatness of galaxy rotation and velocity dispersion profiles , and to the fact that even @xmath8 is measured on a large enough scale that it is essentially unaffected by the presence of the bh .",
    "the mean ratio of @xmath11 to @xmath8 is @xmath19 ; the correlation coefficient of @xmath20 vs @xmath21 is @xmath22 .",
    "-2.55 in -4.3 in    however , we notice that @xmath11 and @xmath8 differ significantly for one particular galaxy , the milky way .",
    "g00 adopted a value of @xmath23 75 for the galaxy based on the velocity dispersion between 50 and 500 arcsec ( kent 1992 ; genzel et al . 2000 ) .",
    "they apparently neglected to account for the contribution of the rotational velocity , which in the same region is 103@xmath2415 ( kent 1992 ) .",
    "more importantly , 500 arcsec corresponds to a projected radius of 20 pc at the galactic center , more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the effective radius of the galactic bulge ( @xmath25 kpc ; cf .",
    "gilmore , king & van der kruit 1990 ) .",
    "the bulge velocity dispersion has been measured by several authors at various galactocentric distances within 4 kpc , all giving values between 75 and 110 , with a tendency for @xmath6 to increase slowly toward the center ( e.g. kent 1992 ; tiede & terndrup 1997 , 1999 ; minniti 1996 ; ct 1999 ; zhao et al .",
    "1996 ) . the rotational velocity in the inner 1.5 kpc is well approximated by a solid body curve with @xmath26 kpc@xmath27 ( e.g. tiede & terndrup 1997 , 1999 ; morrison & harding 1993 ; menzies 1990 ; kinman , feast & lasker 1988 ) . in view of these results",
    ", we question the choice of @xmath28 for the milky way .",
    "fm00 adopted @xmath29 ; in what follows we will perform regression analyses assuming values of both 75 and 100 for @xmath11 .",
    "we will show that the slope of the @xmath30 relation depends significantly on which value is used .",
    "g00 assumed constant errors on log@xmath7 and zero measurement errors in @xmath11 when carrying out their least - square fits .",
    "however , ignoring measurement errors in the independent variable is well known to bias the slope downwards ( e.g jefferys 1980 ) . even when high signal - to - noise data are used , measurement errors on the velocity dispersions are easily at the 10% level ( e.g.    0.3 in    van der marel et al .",
    "1994 ) , and can not be neglected .",
    "unfortunately , the data used by g00 to compute @xmath11 are mostly unpublished , and the authors do not give error estimates in their paper .",
    "therefore , in the regression analyses described below we will make various assumptions about the measurements uncertainties in @xmath11 .    to understand how the different galaxy samples used by fm00 and by g00 may have affected their respective conclusions about the @xmath0 relation , we analyze sample 1 ( the 12 galaxies from paper i ) and sample 2 ( the additional 15 galaxies from g00 ) separately .",
    "the bh masses in sample 2 are significantly less accurate than those in sample 1 , with an rms uncertainty of @xmath31 dex , compared to @xmath32 dex for sample 1 .",
    "we also present results from the analysis of the entire set of 27 galaxies , called the `` combined sample '' below .",
    "we assume a relation of the form @xmath33 between the measured variables , where @xmath34 is @xmath35 and @xmath36 is either @xmath21 or @xmath20 .",
    "units are solar masses for @xmath7 and for @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath37 describe measurement errors as well as intrinsic scatter in the relation , if any .",
    "a large number of regression algorithms are available for recovering estimates @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the slope and intercept and their uncertainties , given ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) and their estimated errors ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "these algorithms differ in the degree of generality of the model that is assumed to underly the data .",
    "the following four algorithms were used here .    _ ordinary least - squares _ ( ols ) .",
    "all of the error is assumed to lie in the dependent variable ( i.e. @xmath35 ) and the amplitude of the error is assumed to be the same from measurement to measurement .",
    "this is the algorithm adopted by g00 .",
    "we use the implementation g02caf from the nag subroutine library .",
    "the ols estimator is biased if there are measurement errors    -4.7 in -3.0 in    in the independent variable , or if the errors in the dependent variable vary from data point to data point ( e.g. jefferys 1980 ) .",
    "_ general least - squares _ ( gls ) .",
    "all of the error is still assumed to reside in the dependent variable , but the amplitude of the error may vary from point to point . press et al .",
    "( 1989 ) implement this model in their routine fit , which we use here .    _ orthogonal distance regression _ ( odr ) .",
    "the underlying variables are assumed to lie exactly on a straight line , i.e. to have no intrinsic scatter , but the observed quantities are allowed to have measurement errors in both @xmath36 and @xmath34 , which may differ from point to point .",
    "this model is incorporated in the routines fitexy of press et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and fv of fasano & vio ( 1988 ) .",
    "we use the former routine here ; the latter was found to give essentially identical results .",
    "the odr estimator may be biased if the true variables exhibit intrinsic scatter about the linear relation , in addition to measurement errors ( e.g. feigelson & babu 1992 ) .    _ regression with bivariate errors and intrinsic scatter _ ( brs ) . as in odr",
    ", the data are permitted to have measurement errors in both @xmath36 and @xmath34 that differ from point to point .",
    "in addition , the underlying variables are allowed to have an intrinsic scatter about the regression line .",
    "we use the routine bces(@xmath43 ) of akritas & bershady ( 1996 ) , the same routine used in paper i.    -0.6 in -3.0 in    tables 2 and 3 give estimates of the slope and intercept , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and their uncertainties as computed by each of the four algorithms , using @xmath8 and @xmath11 as independent variables .",
    "values in parentheses correspond to setting @xmath44 for the milky way , as discussed above .",
    "the results are summarized below and in figure 2 .",
    "accounting for errors in one or both variables increases the slope of the relation , whether expressed in terms of @xmath8 or @xmath11 .",
    "ignoring measurement errors biases the slope too low , for two reasons .",
    "the bh masses in sample 2 are significantly more uncertain than those in sample 1 and , as a group , exhibit a shallower slope ( particularly when expressed in terms of @xmath8 ) ; routines like ols that weight all data equally therefore underestimate the true slope .",
    "second , ignoring measurement errors in the independent variable ( @xmath45 ) _ always _ yields spuriously low slopes ( e.g. jefferys 1980 ) .",
    "we find that the shallowest slope for every sample is returned by ols , the routine used by g00 .",
    "all other algorithms give slopes in the range @xmath46 for the combined sample .",
    "the slope inferred for the @xmath30 relation using odr and brs depends somewhat on the assumed errors in @xmath11 .",
    "increasing the assumed error from @xmath47 to @xmath48 increases the brs slope of the combined sample from @xmath49 to @xmath2 .",
    "-0.5 in -2.0 in    \\3 .",
    "even when the appropriate fitting routines are used , the @xmath18 relation tends to have a steeper slope than the @xmath30 relation .",
    "this difference , however , is driven by one galaxy only : when @xmath11 for the milky way is increased from 75  ( used by g00 ) to a more appropriate  in our opinion  value of 100 , both relations have a best - fit slope of @xmath50 for the combined sample ( assuming a plausible 10% - 15% error on @xmath11 ) .",
    "\\4 . adding the galaxies of sample 2 ( from g00 )",
    "has little impact on the results , as long as measurement errors are taken into account by the fitting routine and @xmath51  is used for the galaxy : the regression lines for sample 1 ( from paper i ) and for the combined sample are essentially the same . in other words ,",
    "the bh masses added by g00 are too uncertain to significantly alter the fit determined by the galaxies from sample 1 alone .",
    "we conclude that the different slopes found by g00 and fm00 ( @xmath1 vs @xmath2 ) are due partly to the neglect of measurement errors by the former authors , and partly to the difference between @xmath11 and @xmath8 for a single data point , the milky way . if we use the more appropriate value of @xmath44 for the milky way , and a plausible 10% - 15% error on @xmath11 , the @xmath18 and @xmath30 relations have essentially the same slope , @xmath52 .",
    "the data points added by g00 , based mostly on unpublished       modelling of stellar kinematical data from stis , appear to contain little information about the @xmath0 relation that was not already contained in the more accurate masses from paper i.    we next address the scatter in the @xmath0 relation . the @xmath53 merit function for a linear fit to data with errors in both variables is @xmath54 ( e.g. press et al .",
    "1989 ) , where , in our case , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "a good fit has @xmath57 .",
    "since measurement uncertainties @xmath58 are not available for the @xmath11 , we computed @xmath59 only for the @xmath18 relation .",
    "we are also interested in the absolute scatter in @xmath35 , which we define as @xmath60 we computed @xmath59 and @xmath61 using the fits given by the brs regression algorithm ( table 2 ) .",
    "the results are :    0.3 in    @xmath62    the sample 2 galaxies exhibit a larger scatter in @xmath35 than the galaxies in sample 1 ( @xmath63 dex vs. @xmath64 dex ) , consistent with their greater measurement uncertainties ( table 1 ) .",
    "furthermore the 12 galaxies from paper i define a significantly tighter correlation , as measured by @xmath59 , than the 15 galaxies added by g00 ( @xmath65 vs. @xmath66 ) , or than the combined sample .",
    "thus we confirm the conclusion of g00 that the scatter in their data about the best - fit linear relation exceeds that expected on the basis of measurement error alone .",
    "the large @xmath59 for sample 2 may indicate that the measurement uncertainties quoted by g00 are too small .",
    "a long - standing discrepancy exists between bh masses determined from stellar kinematics and from reverberation mapping ; the latter technique uses emission lines in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to probe the virial mass within the broad - line region ( netzer & peterson 1997 ) .",
    "since there are currently no galaxies with bh masses determined independently by the two techniques , any comparison must be statistical . the standard approach ( e.g. wandel 1999 )",
    "has been to compare the average bh mass at a given bulge luminosity as computed from reverberation mapping with the mass predicted by the magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) relation ; the latter is based on stellar kinematical data , mostly of low spatial resolution . the discrepancy is a factor of @xmath67 in the sense that the reverberation - mapping masses are too low ( wandel 1999 ) .",
    "this discrepancy has most often been attributed to some unspecified , systematic error in the reverberation mapping masses ( e.g. richstone et al . 1998 ; faber 1999 ; ho 1999 ) .",
    "fm00 showed that the magorrian et al .",
    "masses fall systematically above the @xmath18 relation defined by galaxies with more secure bh mass estimates , some by as much as two orders of magnitude .",
    "the offset is strongly correlated with distance suggesting a systematic , resolution - dependent error in the magorrian et al . modelling .",
    "much or all of the discrepancy with the reverberation mapping masses might therefore be due to systematic errors in the magorrian et al .",
    "masses , contrary to the usual assumption .",
    "gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000b ) tested this idea by plotting seven agn bh masses against their @xmath30 relation.@xmath68 we reproduce that plot here , as figure 3 .",
    "the fit is reasonable , although the points tend to scatter below the line .",
    "we also plot in figure 3 the steeper @xmath18 relation derived in paper i ( given here , in table 2 , as the brs regression fit on @xmath8 for sample 1 ) . the steeper relation of paper i is clearly a better fit .",
    "we stress that several of the agn data points lie at the low - mass end of the distribution where the @xmath0 relation is strongly affected by uncertainties in the slope .",
    "nevertheless , there would no longer appear to be any _ prima facie _ reason for believing that the reverberation mapping masses are systematically in error .",
    "furthermore the scatter in these masses about the @xmath0 relation appears to be comparable to that of the sample 2 data from g00 .",
    "we therefore carried out regression fits combining the reverberation mapping masses with sample 1 and sample 2 , for a total of 34 galaxies .",
    "we assumed @xmath69 measurement errors in the agn @xmath7 and @xmath70 errors in the @xmath8 .",
    "the results ( using the brs regression routine ) were : @xmath71 very close to the parameters derived in paper i using sample 1 alone .",
    "this fit has @xmath72 and @xmath73 , about as good as obtained using the galaxies in table 1 .",
    "we investigated the differences in the @xmath0 relation as derived by ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) and by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000a ) .",
    "the latter authors found a shallower slope ( @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 ) and a greater vertical scatter , larger than expected on the basis of measurement errors alone .",
    "three possible explanations for the differences were explored : different galaxy samples ; different definitions of the velocity dispersion , central ( @xmath8 ) vs integrated ( @xmath11 ) ; and different routines for carrying out the regression .",
    "the shallower slope of the g00 relation was found to be due partly to the use of a regression algorithm that does not account properly for measurement errors , and partly to the adoption of a value of @xmath11 for the milky way which is , in our opinion , implausibly low .",
    "the greater scatter seen by g00 is due to larger uncertainties associated with the additional bh masses included by them , mostly from unpublished stis data .",
    "when measurement uncertainties are properly accounted for , the parameters of the best - fit relation derived from the combined samples of fm00 and g00 are essentially identical to those derived from the sample of fm00 alone .",
    "the steeper relation derived by fm00 also provides a better fit to bh masses obtained from reverberation mapping",
    ". a regression fit to the combined sample of 34 galaxies , including stellar dynamical , gas dynamical , and reverberation mapping masses , yields :      the scientific implications of equation ( 4 ) are discussed briefly by fm00 , and extensively in merritt & ferrarese ( 2000 ) .",
    "this relation is essentially identical to the one derived in paper i. we suggest that there is no longer any reason to assume , as a number of authors ( richstone et al . 1998 ; faber 1999 ; ho 1999 ) have done , that the reverberation mapping masses are less accurate than masses derived from stellar kinematics ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we stress that the current sample of galaxies with reliable bh mass estimates is likely affected by severe selection biases , which are very difficult to quantify .",
    "our results highlight the need for accurate bh masses if the @xmath0 relation is to be further refined . only a handful of galaxies observed with stis",
    "are likely to yield mass estimates as accurate as those already available for the galaxies in paper i. uncertainties in the reverberation mapping masses are probably comparable to those obtained from hst data in most galaxies ; however the number of galaxies with reverberation mapping masses is large ( @xmath75 ) and growing .",
    "furthermore , many of these galaxies are in the critical , low mass range , @xmath76 .",
    "an aggressive campaign to measure stellar velocity dispersions in agn might be the best route toward refining the @xmath0 relation ."
