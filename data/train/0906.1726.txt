    "a lot of research in the field of mathematical logic has been devoted to constructing formal theories intended to capture various schools of thought in the foundations of mathematics .",
    "in particular , the project of reverse mathematics @xcite has provided an extremely detailed analysis of many theories in the language of _ second - order arithmetic _ @xmath5 .",
    "it has been argued that the theories studied correspond closely to different foundational schools ; in particular , that the classical , predicative foundation presented by hermann weyl in his monograph _ das kontinuum _ @xcite is captured by the theory @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the systems of logic known as _ dependent type theories _ have also received a lot of attention , and in particular have proven to offer many practical benefits when used as the basis of the computer systems known as _ proof checkers _ or _ proof assistants_. type theories divide the world of mathematical objects into _ types_. they offer much more expressive power than second - order arithmetic : we are able to speak , not just of natural numbers and sets of natural numbers , but also about ( e.g. ) sets of sets , lists , trees , and functions from any of these types to any of them .",
    "however , so far , type theories have been used almost exclusively to represent _ constructive _ mathematics .",
    "more recently , the concept of a _ logic - enriched type theory _ has been developed .",
    "a logic - enriched type theory is a type theory augmented with a separate , primitive mechanism for forming and proving propositions .",
    "it thus has two components or ` worlds ' : a type - theoretic component , consisting of objects collected into types , and a logical component , for reasoning about these objects .",
    "ltts have been used to investigate the relationships between type theories and set theories @xcite , and by the present authors @xcite to formalise the predicative foundation for mathematics presented by hermann weyl in _",
    "das kontinuum _ @xcite .",
    "there is reason to believe that ltts may offer some of the advantages of both traditional logical systems , and type theories .",
    "they share with type theories the rich type structure and inbuilt notion of computation that have proven to be of great benefit for formalisation in practice . at the same time",
    ", they offer the flexibility in choice of axioms that we are used to in traditional logical systems : it is possible , for example , to add excluded middle to the logical component without changing the type - theoretic component .",
    "this paper is part of an ongoing research project to construct a hierarchy of ltts , similar to the hierarchy of second - order systems in reverse mathematics .",
    "we hope thereby to investigate how ltts may be used to represent different schools of thought in the foundations of mathematics , and to understand the effect that changes in the design of an ltt have on its set of definable objects and provable theorems .    in this paper ,",
    "we construct two ltts that capture two second - order systems that are closely related to the foundation of _ das kontinuum _ : @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we construct two ltts , which we name @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these are more expressive than a second - order system : the type - theoretic component of each features types of natural numbers , pairs , functions of all orders , and sets of all orders .",
    "our aim in this paper is to show that adding this expressive power is ` safe ' ; that is , that we have not thereby increased the proof - theoretic strength of the system .",
    "we do this as follows .",
    "let us say that a proposition of @xmath0 is _ second - order _ iff it uses no types other than @xmath6 ( the type of natural numbers ) and @xmath7 ( the type of sets of natural numbers ) .",
    "we define a translation from @xmath2 onto the second - order propositions of @xmath0 , and prove that the translation is _ conservative _ ; that is , a formula of @xmath5 is provable in @xmath2 if and only if its translation is provable in @xmath0 .",
    "the current authors have previously @xcite presented a new system intended to capture weyl s foundation , which we named @xmath4 .",
    "we argued there that @xmath4 captures weyl s foundation very closely , and described how all the definitions and results in _ das kontinuum _ have been formalised in @xmath4 using a proof assistant .",
    "the two ltts that we construct in this paper are both subsystems of @xmath4 . as a consequence of the work in this paper",
    ", we now know that @xmath4 is strictly stronger than @xmath2 , and at least as strong as @xmath3 .",
    "we argue that , compared with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 corresponds more closely to the system presented in _",
    "das kontinuum_. this is not a claim that can be proven formally , as there is no formal definition of weyl s foundation , but we can advance evidence for it . in our previous paper , we pointed out the extreme similarity between the presentation in _",
    "das kontinuum _ and the definition of @xmath4 , and described one construction in _ das kontinuum _  the construction of @xmath8  that can not be done ` as directly ' in any of the second order systems . here ,",
    "we strengthen the justification for this claim : we show that @xmath9 is expressed by a term in @xmath4 that can not be formed in either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the majority of this paper is taken up with proving the conservativity results . our method for proving",
    "the conservativity of @xmath0 over @xmath2 is as follows .",
    "we first define a subsystem @xmath10 of @xmath0 which has just two types , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . and show that @xmath0 is conservative over @xmath10 .",
    "we then construct infinitely many subsystems of @xmath0 between @xmath10 and @xmath0 .",
    "we prove that , for each of these subsystems @xmath11 and @xmath12 , whenever @xmath11 is a subsystem of @xmath12 , then @xmath12 is conservative over @xmath11 .",
    "we do this by defining an interpretation of the judgements of @xmath12 in terms of the expressions of @xmath11 .",
    "informally , we can think of this as giving a way of reading the judgements of @xmath12 as _ statements about @xmath11_. we show that this interpretation satisfies two properties :    * every derivable judgement of @xmath12 is true . *",
    "every judgement of @xmath11 that is true is derivable in @xmath11 .",
    "it follows that , if a judgement of @xmath11 is derivable in @xmath12 , then it is derivable in @xmath11 .",
    "the proof thus makes use of an original technique which should be of interest in its own right , and which we expect to be applicable in a wide variety of contexts for proving one ltt or type theory conservative over another .",
    "in particular , we shall show how it can be adapted to provide a direct proof that @xmath2 is conservative over peano arithmetic .      in section 2 of this paper",
    ", we describe the subsystems of second order arithmetic that we shall consider , and compare them informally with weyl s system . in section 3 , we give the formal definition of @xmath4 and its two subsystems , and define the translation from second order arithmetic into the ltts . in section 4 ,",
    "we prove that this translation is conservative in the case of @xmath2 and @xmath10 . in section 5",
    ", we prove that @xmath0 is conservative over @xmath10 .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we indicate how the proof can be modified to prove the conservativity of @xmath1 over @xmath3 , and discuss the possibility of constructing a subsystem of @xmath4 conservative over @xmath13 , and the conservativity of @xmath2 over peano arithmetic .",

    "in 1918 , herman weyl wrote the monograph _ das kontinuum _ @xcite , which presented a semi - formal system intended to provide a predicative foundation for mathematics .",
    "weyl s system consists of a set of ` principles ' by which sets , functions and propositions may be introduced . in particular , if we have formed the proposition @xmath26 , we may introduce the set @xmath40 , provided that @xmath26 does not involve any quantification over sets .",
    "impredicative definitions are thus impossible in weyl s system .",
    "his concern was to show how much of mathematics  in particular , how much of analysis  could still be retained under such a restriction .",
    "at the time of writing _",
    "das kontinuum _ in 1918 , weyl agreed with whitehead and russell s opinion @xcite that the source of the famous paradoxes in set theory was the presence of _ impredicative definitions _",
    " definitions that involved a certain kind of _ vicious circle_. in particular , when we introduce a set @xmath41 with the definition @xmath42 then the definition is impredicative if either @xmath22 or any of the bound variables in @xmath26 ranges over a collection that includes the set @xmath41 itself .    in weyl",
    "s foundation , mathematical objects are divided into _",
    "categories_. a category can be _ basic _ or _",
    "ideal_. given any category @xmath14 , there is the ideal category @xmath43 of _ sets _ whose members are objects of category @xmath14 . in a definition of the form ( [ eq : dfset ] ) , we may only quantify over _ basic _ categories .",
    "in particular , we may not quantify over any category of the form @xmath43 .",
    "it is in this manner that impredicative definitions are excluded .    if we bar impredicative definitions , we are unable to define many objects , such as the least upper bound of a bounded set of reals .",
    "we must thus either find an alternative way to introduce these objects , or do without them .",
    "russell and whitehead chose the former course , with their axiom of reducibility .",
    "the monograph _ das kontinuum _ was weyl s attempt to follow the latter course : to show how much of classical mathematics could be preserved while excluding impredicative definitions .",
    "we are concerned in this paper with two subsystems of second order arithmetic , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the letters aca stand for ` arithmetical comprehension axiom ' .",
    "the system @xmath2 is investigated in great detail in simpson @xcite .",
    "these two systems are theories in the language of second order arithmetic , a language for describing natural numbers and sets of natural numbers .",
    "we now introduce this language formally .",
    "the _ language + of second order arithmetic _",
    "@xmath5 is defined as follows .",
    "there are two countably infinite , disjoint sets of _ variables _ : the _ number variables _",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ,  , intended to range over natural numbers ; and the _ set variables _",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath44 ,  , intended to range over sets of natural numbers .",
    "the _ terms _ and _ propositions _ of second order arithmetic are given by the following grammar : @xmath45 we define @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in terms of @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 as usual .",
    "a proposition is _ arithmetic _ iff no set quantifier @xmath54 occurs within it .",
    "the system @xmath2 has been very well studied .",
    "in particular , it has played a major role in the project of reverse mathematics @xcite .",
    "it has often been argued that @xmath2 is closely related to weyl s foundation ; for example , feferman @xcite calls it ` a modern formulation of weyl s system ' , and brown and simpson @xcite write ` @xmath2 isolates the same portion of mathematical practice which was identified as ` predicative analysis ' by herman weyl in his famous monograph das kontinuum ' .",
    "it is known that @xmath2 is conservative over peano arithmetic ( pa ) ; a model - theoretic proof is given in simpson @xcite , and a proof - theoretic proof can be given along the lines of shoenfield @xcite .",
    "a novel proof of this result shall be given in section [ section : acaopa ] .",
    "the axioms of @xmath2 are as follows :    * the _ peano axioms _  the axioms of peano arithmetic , minus the induction axioms : @xmath55 * the _ arithmetical comprehension axiom schema _ : for every arithmetic + proposition @xmath26 in which @xmath30 does not occur free , @xmath56 . * the _ set induction axiom _ : @xmath57 .",
    "the system @xmath3 is formed by extending @xmath2 with the full _ induction axiom schema _ : for every proposition @xmath26 , @xmath58\\phi \\supset \\forall x ( \\phi \\supset [ { \\mathrm{s}}x / x ] \\phi ) \\supset \\forall x \\phi \\enspace .\\ ] ] an argument could be made for @xmath3 being a better representation of the foundation in _ das kontinuum _",
    "than @xmath2 , because  as we shall argue in section [ section : weylssystem ]  weyl makes use of an induction principle that is stronger than that of @xmath2 .",
    "the system @xmath3 has not been studied in the literature as much as @xmath2 .",
    "a few facts about @xmath3 are known : its proof - theoretic ordinal is @xmath59 , and it can prove the consistency of @xmath2 .",
    "see @xcite for the proof of these results and an analysis of the set of models of @xmath3 .",
    "there has been quite some argument over how well weyl s foundation is captured by a subsystem of second order arithmetic .",
    "feferman @xcite has argued strongly in favour of @xmath2 , or a system very like it , being a modern formulation of weyl s system .",
    "this argument can not be settled formally , as weyl did not give a formal definition of his system . however , in the authors view , weyl s system exceeds both @xmath2 and @xmath3 , for the following reasons :    1 .",
    "weyl intended his system to be more than second order .",
    "he allowed the category @xmath60 to be formed for _ any _ category @xmath15 , basic or ideal .",
    "thus , for example , we can form the categories @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and so forth .",
    "weyl intended the principle of induction to apply to all propositions , arithmetic or not .",
    "we justify this by showing a place where weyl explicitly defines a function of category @xmath63 , and three places where he proves a non - arithmetic proposition by induction .",
    "the former occurs @xcite with the definition of the cardinality of a set .",
    "weyl defines a function @xmath64 by @xmath65 this function is then iterated , to form the function + @xmath66 .",
    "weyl goes on to argue that @xmath67 denotes the set of all sets with at least @xmath68 elements ( where @xmath69 is the set of all subsets of @xmath14 ) .",
    "he defines the proposition @xmath70 , ` @xmath30 has at least @xmath68 elements ' , by @xmath71    various results about this definition are later proved @xcite , such as :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if @xmath30 has at least @xmath72 elements , then @xmath30 has at least @xmath68 elements .",

'",
    "thus , weyl s method of defining @xmath70 involves third - order sets ; the application of the principle of iteration to third - order sets ; and proof by induction of a proposition that quantifies over sets .",

    "in this section , we introduce the logic - enriched type theory @xmath4 and the two subsystems with which we are concerned .    logic - enriched type theories ( ltts ) were introduced by aczel and gambino @xcite to study the relationship between type theories and set theories .",
