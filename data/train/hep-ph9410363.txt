    "this report is an expanded version of a talk given at cam-94 , the joint meeting of the canadian association of physicists , the american physical society , and the mexican physical society .",
    "i discuss here an extension of the qcd sum rule program to finite temperature . at @xmath0 ,",
    "qcd sum rules offer a very successful quantum field theory framework to extract information on hadronic physics from qcd analytically .",
    "this great success , unfortunately , does not translate immediately into the finite temperature domain , where there are some serious unresolved problems with laplace transform sum rules . in spite of this , some reasonable progress has been made through lowest moment finite energy sum rules ( fesr ) .",
    "as with any new field , some degree of confusion is to be expected as our ideas take shape , and we gain a better understanding of the subject .",
    "it is important , though , not to persist on wrong notions , nor advocate results which have been shown to be in contradiction with more fundamental _",
    "facts_. i shall attempt to clarify here some misconceptions present in the existing literature on this subject .",
    "the purpose is not to antagonize , but rather to point out the problems and promote discussion that might help to solve them .",
    "i may group these misconceptions into two categories : ( a ) conceptual , and ( b ) specific results of applications . among the first",
    "is the statement ( without proof ) that the notion of qcd - hadron duality , one of the two pillars of qcd sum rules , should abruptly disappear as soon as the temperature is turned on ( by no matter what small amount ) .",
    "if correct , this proposition would invalidate a smooth extension of the qcd sum rule program to @xmath1 .",
    "i shall argue against this scenario .",
    "second , and in connection with results of applications , there exist quite a few determinations of hadron masses based on laplace transforms which ignore the underlying problems with these sum rules .",
    "chief among these problems is the fact that they are inconsistent with the well known ( and well established ) temperature behaviour of the quark condensate and the gluon condensate . not surprisingly ,",
    "the predictions from this approach are in serious contradiction with the @xmath2-dependence of hadron masses obtained in other independent frameworks .",
    "+ the outline of this report is as follows . in section 2",
    "i introduce briefly the key ideas behind qcd sum rules at @xmath0 , and argue for a smooth extension of this program to finite temperature .",
    "i discuss supportive evidence for the validity of both the operator product expansion , and the notion of qcd - hadron duality at @xmath3 .",
    "section 3 deals with chiral - symmetry restoration , and in section 4 i review proposals for phenomenological order parameters to characterize deconfinement . in section 5",
    "i show how these two phase transitions have been related using a lowest moment fesr - qcd sum rule .",
    "section 6 summarizes recent results for the temperature behaviour of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion in the space - like region , once again through a lowest moment fesr .",
    "finally , in section 7 i concentrate on the problems with laplace transform qcd sum rules , as well as with higher moment fesr , and make critical comments on the existing literature . except for a major part of section 7 ,",
    "the ideas and results presented here have already been published in the literature , and the reader may trace them through the list of references .",
    "qcd sum rules at @xmath0 @xcite are based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) of current correlators at short distances , suitably extended to include non - perturbative effects .",
    "the latter are parametrized in terms of a set of vacuum expectation values of the quark and gluon fields entering the basic qcd lagrangian .",
    "contact with the hadronic world of large distances is achieved by invoking the notion of qcd - hadron duality .",
    "this leads to relationships between fundamental qcd parameters ( @xmath4 , quark masses , vacuum condensates , etc . ) and low energy parameters ( hadron masses , widths , couplings , form factors , etc . ) .",
    "the values of the vacuum condensates in the ope can not be calculated analytically from first principles , as this would be tantamount to solving qcd exactly .",
    "instead , they are extracted from certain channels where experimental information is available , e.g. @xmath5 annihilation , and @xmath6 decays @xcite .",
    "it is also possible , in principle , to estimate them numerically from lattice qcd . to be more specific ,",
    "let us consider the two - point function @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a local current built from the quark and/or gluon fields entering the qcd lagrangian , and having specific quantum numbers . in the sequel i concentrate on light quark flavours .",
    "the ope of @xmath9 is formally written as @xmath10 where the wilson coefficients @xmath11 depend on the lorentz indices and quantum numbers of the external current @xmath8 , and also of the local gauge - invariant operators @xmath12 built from the quark and gluon fields of qcd .",
    "the unit operator @xmath13 in eq.(2.2 ) represents the purely perturbative piece .",
    "the ope is assumed valid , even in the presence of non - perturbative effects , for @xmath14 ( spacelike ) , and @xmath15 @xmath16 . in principle , all wilson coefficients are calculable in perturbative qcd to any desired order in the strong coupling constant . in the sequel",
    "we shall work at leading ( one loop ) order for simplicity .",
    "the non - perturbative effects are then buried in the vacuum condensates . since these have dimensions , the associated wilson coefficients fall off as inverse powers of @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , if the current @xmath8 in eq.(2.1 ) is identified with the axial - vector current @xmath18 , then with @xmath19 one easily finds @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a renormalization scale , and e.g. the leading vacuum condensate is given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . in eq.(2.4 )",
    "a term proportional to @xmath25 has been neglected .",
    "the function @xmath26 , eq .",
    "( 2.4 ) , satisfies a dispersion relation @xmath27 defined in this case up to one subtraction constant , which can be disposed of by e.g. taking the first derivative with respect to @xmath28 in eq.(2.6 ) .",
    "the notion of qcd - hadron duality is implemented by calculating the left hand side of eq.(2.6 ) in qcd through the ope , and parametrizing the spectral function entering the right hand side in terms of hadronic resonances , followed by a hadronic continuum modelled by perturbative qcd . in this fashion one relates fundamental qcd parameters , such as quark masses , renormalization scales , vacuum condensates , etc .",
    ", to hadronic parameters such as particle masses , widths , couplings , etc .. the convergence of the hilbert transform , eq.(2.6 ) , may be improved by considering other integral kernels .",
    "this leads to other versions of qcd sum rules , such as the laplace transform , finite energy sum rules ( fesr ) , etc .. for instance , the laplace transform qcd sum rule for the axial - axial correlator is @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the laplace parameter which plays the role of @xmath28 as the short distance expansion parameter ( for light quark correlators ) . performing the laplace transform of eq.(2.4 )",
    "one finds @xcite @xmath31 one should notice from eq.(2.8 ) that in laplace transform qcd sum rules * all * condensates are involved .",
    "their numerical importance , though , is suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath30 , as well as by factorial coefficients .",
    "+ either by using cauchy theorem , or by expanding eq.(2.7 ) in @xmath30 , the laplace transform qcd sum rule eq.(2.7 ) is equivalent to the infinite number of fesr @xmath32 where n=1,2 , ... , and @xmath33 stands for the purely resonant contribution to the hadronic spectral function ( i.e. without the continuum ) . for @xmath34 , @xmath35 is nothing but a short - hand notation for the perturbative quark mass insertion ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "a practical advantage of these fesr is that now the vacuum condensates of different dimensionality are effectively decoupled .",
    "this becomes particularly important if the objective is to extract the values of these condensates from a knowledge of the hadronic spectral function .",
    "in fact , this is the correct procedure followed in @xcite to determine the condensates from data on @xmath5 annihilation and @xmath6-decays .",
    "the decoupling of the different @xmath37 is also important to study the self - consistency of the laplace transform qcd sum rules at @xmath1 , as will be discussed in section 7 .",
    "an extension of this qcd sum rule program to finite temperature was proposed some time ago in @xcite .",
    "this proposal entails the assumptions that ( a ) the ope continues to be valid , except that now the vacuum condensates will develop an ( _ a - priori _ )",
    "unknown temperature dependence , and ( b ) the notion of qcd - hadron duality also remains valid .",
    "i shall discuss below some evidence in support of these two assumptions .",
    "notice that in analogy with the situation at @xmath0 , the thermal behaviour of the vacuum condensates is not calculable analytically from first principles . some model or approximation must be invoked , e.g. the dilute pion gas approximation , lattice qcd , etc .. the quark , the gluon , and the four - quark condensates at @xmath1 have thus been estimated in the literature @xcite- @xcite . at finite temperature ,",
    "the basic object to be considered is the retarded ( advanced ) two - point function after appropriate gibbs averaging @xmath38 > > \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is a complete set of eigenstates of the ( qcd ) hamiltonian .",
    "the ope of @xmath41 is now written as @xmath42 it must be stressed that the states @xmath40 entering eq.(2.11 ) can be * any * complete set of states , e.g. hadronic states , quark - gluon basis , etc .. the hadronic ( mostly pion ) basis has been advocated in @xcite , while the quark - gluon basis was first used in @xcite .",
    "these two approaches are quite complementary , rather than in conflict , as the information they provide is somewhat different .",
    "the pion basis is well suited to determine the temperature dependence of vacuum condensates at low @xmath2 .",
    "it does not make use of qcd - hadron duality , and thus has little relationship to the qcd sum rule program . on the other hand , use of the quark - gluon basis",
    "allows for a smooth extension of that program to finite temperature .",
    "as it continues to rely on both the ope and qcd - hadron duality , this approach provides information on thermal green functions provided the temperature dependence of the condensates is known .",
    "since the latter can be obtained e.g. from using the pion basis in eq.(2.11 ) , the two choices of the complete set @xmath40 complement each other .",
    "however , it must be kept in mind that the choice of the pion basis , being a form of the virial expansion , is restricted to low temperatures .",
    "this is not necessarily the case for the quark - gluon basis approach .",
    "in fact , given an expression for the condensates in some framework , accurate enough for * all * @xmath2 up to the critical temperature , the qcd sum rules will provide the @xmath2-dependence of hadronic matrix elements in the * same * temperature range .",
    "the validity of the ope ( at any temperature ) beyond perturbation theory can not be proven from first principles , since one does not know how to solve qcd exactly . however , at @xmath0 one can solve exactly other field theories which bear some resemblance to qcd , thus providing evidence in support of this assumption .",
    "for instance , a study of the ( exactly solvable ) @xmath43 sigma model , in the large @xmath44 limit , and of the schwinger model , both in two dimensions , shows that the short distance approximation to exact green functions agrees with the result from the ope @xcite .",
    "an extension of this analysis to finite temperature @xcite shows the same agreement , and thus supports the assumption of the validity of the ope in this regime .",
    "i briefly summarize the results of @xcite .",
    "let me consider first the @xmath43 sigma model in 1 + 1 dimensions which is characterized by the lagrangian @xmath45 \\ ; [ \\partial_{\\mu } \\sigma^{a } ( x ) ] \\ ; , \\ ] ] where a = 1, ... n , and @xmath46 , with f being the coupling constant . in the large @xmath44 limit this model can be solved exactly ( for details see @xcite ) , it is known to be asymptotically free , and in spite of the absence of mass parameters in eq.(2.13 ) , it exhibits dynamical mass generation .",
    "in addition , in this model there are vacuum condensates , e.g. to leading order in 1/n : @xmath47 , whereas all other condensates factorize , viz . @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath49 field is : @xmath50 , and we are interested in the green function associated with the propagation of quanta of this @xmath49 field .",
    "we have calculated this green function at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "its imaginary part can be integrated analytically in closed form and is @xmath51\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath52\\ ] ] where the first term above corresponds to the perturbative contribution , the second to the non - perturbative , and @xmath53 is the thermal bose factor .",
    "equation ( 2.14 ) is valid in the time - like region ; the space - like region counterpart vanishes in 2 dimensions .",
    "since the model is exactly solvable , the thermal behaviour of the vacuum condensates can also be calculated , viz .",
    "@xmath54\\ ] ] in this case the vacuum condensates contribute to the imaginary part , and as eq.(2.14 ) shows , the thermal dependence of the perturbative piece can not be absorbed into the condensates .",
    "hence , no confusion should arise between perturbative and non - perturbative contributions .",
    "+ next , i consider the schwinger model in 1 + 1 dimensions , with the lagrangian @xmath55 where @xmath56 . at t=0",
    "this model has been solved exactly , and in the framework of the ope @xcite .",
    "the short distance expansion of the exact solution coincides with that from the ope . here , we are interested in the two - point functions @xmath57 @xmath58 where the scalar currents are : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , with @xmath61 .",
    "the function @xmath62 vanishes identically in perturbation theory , and the leading non - perturbative contribution involves a four - fermion vacuum condensate .",
    "we have calculated the thermal behaviour of these current correlators @xcite and obtain , e.g. for their imaginary parts in the time - like region ( again , there is no space - like contribution in 2 dimensions ) @xmath63 @xmath64\\ ] ] hence , the choice of the fermion basis in the gibbs average of current correlators does not imply confusing these fermions with condensates , as argued in @xcite . as eqs.(2.19)-(2.20 ) indicate , ( perturbative ) fermion loop terms and ( non - perturbative ) vacuum condensates develop their own temperature dependence , which in this particular example happen to be different . + concerning the notion of qcd - hadron duality , it has been suggested recently @xcite that it is not applicable at finite temperature . if correct , this would require a singular dynamical mechanism of a discontinuous nature in order to invalidate the inter - relationship between qcd and hadronic parameters effected by duality .",
    "no such mechanism has been proposed in @xcite . that this inter - relationship would abruptly disappear by raising the temperature from @xmath0 to some arbitrary small value ,",
    "say a nano - kelvin , seems quite unlikely , especially in the absence of a concrete mechanism to achieve it . according to the qcd sum rule philosophy , at @xmath0",
    "one calculates the theoretical left hand side of eq.(2.6 ) through the ope eq.(2.2 ) , i.e. one uses quark - gluon degrees of freedom , and duality relates this qcd part to a weighted average of the hadronic spectral function .",
    "the latter arises from using hadronic degrees of freedom . at very low temperatures",
    "the hadronic spectrum is expected to change very little , and the external current will still convert into quark - antiquark pairs . the temperature dependence of the quark and gluon condensates is known , and at very low @xmath2 they also hardly change .",
    "hence , it is only reasonable to assume that nothing drastic will happen to duality .",
    "there is a sort of _ temperature inertia _ affecting both qcd and hadronic physics at very low @xmath2 .",
    "at finite temperature , though , there are some new effects coming into play , e.g. there are contributions to the qcd and hadronic spectral functions in the space - like region ( as opposed to only the time - like region at @xmath0 ) , and the heat bath can support condensates with non - trivial quantum numbers .",
    "however , these additional contributions vanish smoothly as t approaches zero , i.e. they do not introduce any discontinuous behaviour that would abruptly invalidate the notion of qcd - hadron duality . at moderate temperatures",
    "the hadronic spectrum is expected to suffer some rearrangement , in pace with changes in the condensates and the increasing importance of the new analytic structure in the complex energy plane . by retaining",
    "the notion of qcd - hadron duality one is able to relate quantitatively the temperature dependence of hadronic parameters with that of qcd parameters , as will be discussed in sections 5 - 6 .",
    "i begin by discussing some of the symmetries of the qcd lagrangian @xmath65 where @xmath66 \\ ; , \\ ] ] with @xmath67    and @xmath68 the quark mass matrix . for the purposes of this talk",
    "i consider only two quark flavours ( up and down ) . among the various symmetries of @xmath69 one",
    "finds a ( global ) @xmath70 and an @xmath71 symmetry .",
    "these lagrangian symmetries are explicitly broken by the quark masses .",
    "in fact , the vector ( i - spin ) noether current @xmath72 , and the axial - vector current @xmath73 have divergences @xmath74 @xmath75 in the limit @xmath76 , and @xmath71 become exact lagrangian symmetries .",
    "however , this is not what is usually meant by chiral - symmetry restoration , which refers to the symmetry of the vacuum . given a lagrangian symmetry one must investigate how it is realized in the states , starting with the vacuum . according to whether the noether charges @xmath77 annihilate the vacuum or not , one has a wigner - weyl or a nambu - goldstone realization of the lagrangian symmetry . in the former case particles are classified according to the irreducible representations of the symmetry group , as in e.g. @xmath70 .",
    "the nambu - goldstone realization ( spontaneous symmetry breaking ) corresponds to a _ hidden _ symmetry , as the vacuum does not share the symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "this is the case for @xmath71 since e.g. there are no ( quasi ) degenerate parity doublets in the particle spectrum .",
    "no particle classification is possible in this phase as the vacuum is _ contaminated _ by an arbitrary number of massless ( nambu - goldstone ) bosons carrying non- trivial quantum numbers . in the case of @xmath71",
    "the three emerging nambu - goldstone bosons are readily identified with the pion @xmath78 , which decays to the ( hadronic ) vacuum through the axial - vector current , i.e. @xmath79 with @xmath80 mev . in the limit @xmath81",
    "the axial - vector current is strictly conserved and , hence , @xmath82 . in the nambu - goldstone phase @xmath83 @xmath84 with the proportionality constants such that @xmath85 . a phase transition from a nambu - goldstone to a wigner - weyl mode ( * chiral - symmetry restoration * )",
    "is characterized by the vanishing of the order parameter @xmath86,or alternatively @xmath87 .",
    "clearly , this can only happen at finite temperature , and if the phase transition does take place this should happen regardless of whether the quark masses are zero or not . the numerical value of the critical temperature , though , is expected to depend on this fact .",
    "+ the temperature behaviour of @xmath88 at low @xmath2 @xmath89 has been investigated in chiral perturbation theory with the result @xcite @xmath90 \\ ; , \\ ] ] in the chiral limit for three flavours .",
    "chiral - symmetry breaking corrections to eq.(3.9 ) have been also calculated @xcite , together with corrections due to massive states @xcite .",
    "the low temperature expansion of @xmath91 has been carried out up to order @xmath92 in @xcite .",
    "as the authors of @xcite,@xcite have pointed out , this low temperature expansion should not be extrapolated to the critical temperature , as it is not valid there .",
    "for instance , if the phase transition is of second order then the critical exponent should be @xmath93 , rather than 2 as one would naively obtain from eq.(3.9 ) .",
    "if one is interested in the behaviour of @xmath88 near @xmath94 , other methods should be used , e.g. the composite operator formalism of @xcite , which reproduces eq.(3.9 ) at low @xmath2 , but gives instead @xmath95 as @xmath96 .",
    "this feature will become particularly important in section 5 .",
    "at zero temperature the shape of a typical hadronic spectral function consists of some delta functions plus resonances with increasing widths , followed by a smooth continuum starting at some threshold energy @xmath97 .",
    "it is known from fits to actual data that for @xmath98 the hadronic spectral functions are well approximated by perturbative qcd ; @xmath97 is thus called the asymptotic freedom ( a.f . ) threshold .",
    "this picture is well supported by all exisiting experimental data . under the assumption that quark deconfinement does take place at some critical temperature @xmath99",
    ", one would expect that by increasing @xmath2 from @xmath0 the resonance peaks in the spectral function should become broader . at @xmath100",
    "the resonance widths would then become infinite , signalling quark deconfinement .",
    "this resonance melting with increasing temperature would be accompanied by a shift of the asymptotic freedom threshold @xmath101 towards threshold . in this picture",
    "the resonance width , and/or the asymptotic freedom threshold provide a suitable order parameter .",
    "+ in the complex s - plane , bound states ( e.g. the pion ) correspond to poles of the s - matrix lying on the real axis , and resonances correspond to poles located in the second riemann sheet , their distance to the real axis being measured by the width @xmath102 . at finite temperature the form of the green function will be @xmath103 in the picture described above , an increase in the temperature will shift * all * poles farther away from the real axis as @xmath104 increases . while the mass @xmath105 may depend on @xmath2 ,",
    "it is not a relevant order parameter . with the second riemann sheet poles infinitely far from the real axis , and the a.f .",
    "threshold correspondingly close to the origin , the spectral function is then described entirely by the qcd continuum extrapolated down to the kinematic threshold .",
    "one may interpret such a phase as a deconfined phase where all hadrons originally contributing to the spectral function have melted into quarks or quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "as an example , let us consider the following ansatz for the rho - meson width @xmath106 where @xmath99 is the critical temperature for deconfinement , and @xmath49 a positive number .",
    "the behaviour of the hadronic spectral function in the vector channel , with @xmath107 , @xmath108 as in eq.(4.2 ) with @xmath109 , is illustrated in fig . 1 for two values of the temperature : @xmath0 ( solid curve ) , and @xmath110 ( dashed curve ) .    in the case of stable hadrons ,",
    "e.g. the pion or the nucleon , for which @xmath111 , we would expect an imaginary part in their propagators to develop for @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", these hadronic thermal widths should be interpreted as damping coefficients of wave packets propagating through a dispersive medium ( heat bath ) .",
    "their growth with increasing temperature implies that , with hadrons corresponding to excitations in this medium , these excitations become less and less important .",
    "combined with the notion of qcd - hadron duality , this may be interpreted as the melting of hadrons into their constituents , thus signalling a deconfinement phase transition .",
    "+ i wish to stress that the relevant order parameter for deconfinement should be the width and not the mass .",
    "claims have been made occasionally in the literature that the mass should vanish at the critical temperature . while this may happen in some cases , it is not a necessary condition for deconfinement .",
    "in fact , let us consider a stable hadron , i.e. one with zero width at zero temperature , such as the pion or the nucleon .",
    "if with increasing temperature the mass goes to zero , and nothing happens to the width , then at the critical temperature one would still see a peak in the hadronic spectral function at zero energy .",
    "the hadron has not disappeared from the spectrum , and hence has not melted ! the only way a particle can melt is by having a temperature dependent width such that @xmath112 as @xmath96 .",
    "what happens to the mass ( defined as the position of the pole on the real axis ) is irrelevant to this argument .",
    "once the resonance becomes infinitely broad , the spectral function becomes smooth and should be well approximated by the quark degrees of freedom , i.e. by perturbative qcd .",
    "since this proposal was first made in @xcite independent supportive theoretical evidence has become available . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown in the framework of the virial expansion that : ( a ) at low temperatures ( @xmath113 mev ) and in the chiral limit ( @xmath114 ) the mass of the nucleon @xmath115 , and its width @xmath116 ; ( b ) at higher temperatures , and now away from the chiral limit , both @xmath117 and @xmath118 * increase * slightly ( by 4% and 1% , respectively , up to @xmath119 mev ) , while @xmath120 and @xmath121 increase substantially , e.g. at @xmath122 mev the ratio of width to mass ( imaginary to real part of the propagator ) is about 43% for the pion and 20% for the nucleon .",
    "since the pion and nucleon widths are strictly zero at @xmath123 , this is quite a dramatic effect .",
    "additional evidence for the approximate constancy of @xmath124 and @xmath125 follows from the sigma model @xcite , which also gives increases over @xmath126 and @xmath127 at the level of a few percent .",
    "further support comes from a recent calculation of @xmath118 in the composite operator formalism @xcite , showing approximate constancy of the pion mass over a wide range of temperatures , with a tendency to * increase * near the critical temperature .",
    "qcd sum rules give a similar t - dependence of the nucleon mass @xcite .",
    "the temperature behaviour of the pion and nucleon widths have also been calculated recently in the framework of the sigma model @xcite .",
    "the results are in qualitative agreement with @xcite , and are shown in figs . 2 - 3 for three different values of the @xmath128-meson mass : @xmath129 = 400 mev ( a ) , 600 mev ( b ) , 800 mev ( c ) .",
    "concerning the rho - meson mass , it has been shown @xcite that to first order in the virial expansion , unitarity of the @xmath130 scattering amplitude requires that if @xmath131 increases with @xmath2 , then @xmath132 must also * increase * with @xmath2 .",
    "i shall come back to this point in section 7 .",
    "let us consider the retarded two - point function eq.(2.10 ) involving the axial - vector current @xmath133 . as discussed in section 2 ,",
    "the qcd sum rule program consists in calculating the two - point function in the deep euclidean region in perturbative qcd , adding non - perturbative effects parametrized in terms of vacuum expectation values of the quark and gluon fields appearing in the qcd lagrangian , and relating the result to the hadronic spectral function by means of a dispersion relation .    in order to find the perturbative qcd behaviour of eq.(2.10 )",
    "we assume a dilute quark gas at temperature @xmath2 with zero chemical potential .",
    "the virtual quanta associated to the local current @xmath134 will convert into @xmath135 pairs for @xmath136 , while for space - like momenta @xmath137 there is an additional cut in the complex @xmath138-plane centered around @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "these two distinct processes contribute to the spectral function as follows    @xmath140    @xmath141 \\ ; , \\ ] ]    for @xmath142 , and    @xmath143    @xmath144 \\;\\ ] ]    for @xmath14 . in the above equations @xmath145 is the fermi - dirac distribution function , and the phase space is @xmath146 @xmath147",
    "it must be stressed that the above two contributions to the spectral function , arising from different physical mechanisms , are unrelated .",
    "the first contribution ( @xmath142 ) leads to the usual right- and left - hand cuts in the complex energy plane , and does not vanish at @xmath148 .",
    "the second piece ( @xmath14 ) comes from a new cut centered around @xmath139 , vanishes at @xmath148 , and is unrelated to duality .    on the hadronic side , at low temperatures @xmath149 , only pions from the gas",
    "will contribute to the spectral function .",
    "in addition to the ( time - like ) pion pole contribution to @xmath150 , there is a ( space - like ) piece in the hadronic spectral function @xmath151 from the center cut in the complex @xmath138-plane .",
    "the latter involves an integral of @xmath152 weighted by bose factors .",
    "however , since @xmath153 this term appears at order @xmath154 in im@xmath155 .",
    "in addition , the numerical coefficient of this term is very small .",
    "hence , a parametrization in terms of the pion pole plus a continuum modelled by perturbative qcd should be a good approximation to the hadronic spectral function .",

    "the advantage of our choice of green function should be evident : at low temperatures ( @xmath149 ) apart from @xmath88 there are no other unknown @xmath2-dependent hadronic parameters such as masses and widths .",
    "for instance , qcd sum rules for the correlator of two vector currents at @xmath162 @xcite,@xcite , involve @xmath132 and @xmath131 which , unlike @xmath88 , are a priori unknown and model - dependent .",

    "according to the interpretation of @xmath161 as a relevant order parameter for quark deconfinement ( see section 4 ) , one can conclude that the qcd - fesr provide evidence for the existence of this phase transition .",
    "independent phenomenological evidence for the deconfinement phase transition in qcd may be obtained e.g. by studying the thermal behaviour of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion , @xmath171 . in this case",

    "this divergence of @xmath210 may be interpreted as a signal for quark deconfinement .",

    "this result is in qualitative agreement with the one obtained in the framework of the nambu - jona lasinio model @xcite .",

    "i shall concentrate mostly in the vector - vector correlator , e.g. the @xmath211-meson channel .",
    "all of these analyses suffer from the following serious drawbacks .    since the laplace sum rule is equivalent to an infinite number of fesr , it is simpler to break it up into a series of fesr in order to show ( ii ) above .",

    "the contribution of massive states , as well as chiral symmetry breaking corrections , become gradually more important . numerically , though , with @xmath223 @xcite these corrections are below the 10% level at @xmath224 @xcite . in view of this",

    "+ let us turn the argument around , and assume a temperature functional form for @xmath132 and @xmath131 , and use the three fesr to determine @xmath161 , @xmath229 , and @xmath230 . for definiteness i shall assume that @xmath131 is given by eq.(4.2 )",

    "the latter analysis leads to a monotonically increasing @xmath132 .",
    "case ( a ) has already been discussed in @xcite ; the solutions of the first two fesr for @xmath161 and @xmath229 , respectively , are shown in fig.6 . although @xmath161 does decrease with @xmath2 as expected , the thermal dependence of the gluon condensate is definitely wrong . also , solving the third fesr eq.(7.3 )",
    "gives a quark condensate that decreases with @xmath2 even faster than the gluon condensate , again in contradiction with expectations .",
    "next , case ( b ) is qualitatively similar to case ( a ) , as may be appreciated from fig.7 . in this figure ,",
    "the function @xmath132 is taken from @xcite .",
    "hence , the conclusion from this analysis is that while the first fesr , eq.(7.1 ) , does lead to a reasonable result for @xmath161 , the higher moment fesr are in contradiction with the known @xmath2-dependence of the vacuum condensates .",
    "therefore , the fesr program breaks down beyond the lowest moment , and so does the laplace transform . as mentioned before ,",
    "this analysis can be carried out directly with laplace sum rules , without reference to the fesr , but the conclusions are the same .",
    "+ there is a third possibility , which i find quite attractive ( although it does not solve the above inconsistency problem ) .",
    "this is to consider the ratio @xmath232 as a universal function , i.e. the same for any channel .",
    "clearly , the value of @xmath233 will depend on the particular channel under consideration , as it is obviously different in the vector and axial - vector channels , and the nucleon channel , etc .. however , the ratio @xmath232 may be thought of as a phenomenological order parameter for deconfinement , in which case it is reasonable to assume it is channel - independent . in this case",
    ", one can use e.g. the first fesr eq.(7.1 ) to predict @xmath132 , and the second fesr eq.(7.2 ) to predict @xmath229 .",
    "the results of this excercise are shown in fig.8 , where i have used @xmath232 from @xcite ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "interestingly enough , the temperature dependence of the @xmath212-meson mass turns out to be in good agreement with the determination using unitarity of the @xmath130 scattering to lowest order in the virial expansion @xcite .",
    "this supports the validity of the lowest moment fesr eq.(7.1 ) , but unfortunately it does not solve the problem with the higher moment fesr or with the laplace transform , as @xmath229 comes out wrong . whether additional mechanisms could be brought into play in order to rescue the qcd sum rule program remains an open problem . + concerning the existing analyses of the vector channel based on laplace sum rules @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , they all predict a * decrease * of the @xmath212-meson mass with increasing @xmath2",
    "this is in contradiction with the result of @xcite , which is quite general . in the light of the above discussion",
    ", it is possible to understand why these analyses predict the wrong @xmath2-dependence of @xmath234 .",
    "laplace sum rules are inconsistent with the known thermal behaviour of the quark and gluon condensates .",
    "there is also a laplace sum rule determination of the nucleon mass at finite temperature @xcite which gives again a monotonically decreasing @xmath117 .",
    "this is in contradiction with a lowest moment fesr analysis @xcite which predicts an almost constant nucleon mass .",
    "it is also inconsistent with @xcite .",
    "the reason behind the discrepancy is the same as in the vector channel .",
    "i should add that in @xcite it is claimed that the nucleon mass should decrease , since it is proportional to the quark condensate @xmath235 .",
    "this argument is falacious because the contribution from the hadronic cut in the complex energy plane centered around the origin ( the so called _ scattering _ term ) prevents the nucleon mass from decreasing @xcite .",
