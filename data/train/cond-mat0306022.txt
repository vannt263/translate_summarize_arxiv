    "the nonextensive statistics developed by tsallis  @xcite has motivated a phenomenological approach  @xcite which was recently used  @xcite to describe lagrangian acceleration of fluid particle in developed three - dimensional turbulent flow within the framework of langevin type equation ; see also  @xcite . some recent stochastic particle models and refinements of this technique  @xcite",
    "were reviewed in ref .",
    "the one - dimensional langevin toy models of lagrangian turbulence lacks of physical interpretation , _",
    "e.g. , _ of short term dynamics , or small - scale and large - scale contributions , in the context of three - dimensional incompressible navier - stokes equation , which is generally assumed to be capable to describe fully developed turbulence .",
    "a deep physical analysis of this problem has been made by gotoh and kraichnan  @xcite .",
    "recently  @xcite we have shown that the one - dimensional laval - dubrulle - nazarenko ( ldn ) type toy model  @xcite of the acceleration dynamics with the model turbulent viscosity @xmath0 and coupled delta - correlated gaussian multiplicative and additive noises is in a good agreement with the recent high - precision experimental data on acceleration statistics  @xcite .",
    "particularly , we have demonstrated that the predicted contribution to fourth order moment of acceleration does peak at the same values as the experimental curve , in contrast to predictions of most of the other stochastic particle models  @xcite .",
    "we note however that characteristic parts of the acceleration distribution are the core and tails , while the intermediate range of accelerations which is responsible for positions of the peaks may be not robust .",
    "below we discuss at some length on foundations of the present model , and focus on modeling acceleration statistics conditional on velocity fluctuations .",
    "the original one - dimensional ldn model was formulated both in the lagrangian and eulerian frameworks for small - scale velocity increments .",
    "it is based on a stochastic kind of batchelor - proudman rapid distortion theory ( rdt ) approach to the three - dimensional navier - stokes equation and gabor transformation  @xcite .",
    "small scales are separated and assumed to be stochastically distorted by much larger scales .",
    "such nonlocal interactions which can be viewed as elongated triads are featured by the three - dimensional ldn model , to which the one - dimensional model makes an approximation , particularly via mimicking relationship between stretching and vorticity .",
    "local interactions are modeled by the turbulent viscosity which is taken due to the renormalization group approach .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use the lagrangian formulation of the one - dimensional ldn model , which is characterized by a simple structure , as an ansatz to formulate langevin type equation for the component of fluid particle acceleration in statistically homogeneous and isotropic developed turbulence .    in general the langevin type equation which we employ here",
    "contains wellknown terms , namely , time derivative of the variable , an additive noise , and a nonlinear drift term with a multiplicative noise ; see eq .",
    "( [ langevinlaval ] ) below .",
    "the noises represent large scales and are treated independent on small scales . in the lagrangian frame , they are taken in the simplest realization , gaussian white - in - time with zero mean , and are assumed to be delta - correlated to each other .",
    "such choice of the noises correspond to the zero - time approximation of small time - scale correlations viewed along the lagrangian trajectory of fluid particle .",
    "direct account for finite time correlations in a langevin type equation is important but this is beyond the scope of the present study , in which we concentrate on the longtime behavior and qualitative analysis .",
    "longtime dynamics of large scales is ignored in this particular case of the ldn model .    in the conventional approach , wandering of the tracer particle can be described within the framework of generalized brownian like motion , with the acceleration chosen to be the random variable depending on time @xmath1 ( a stochastic process ) .",
    "the statistical isotropy allows one to decompose the acceleration into the ` transverse ' and ` longitudinal ' components with respect to the corresponding velocity that reduces formally the analysis to effective two - dimensional consideration of the essentially three - dimensional system .",
    "the isotropy is assumed to be local , in the neighbor of fluid particle . in one - dimensional models",
    "one considers one of the two components not coupled to each other .",
    "joint dynamics of the components of acceleration is of much interest and can be considered elsewhere .",
    "it should be emphasized here that the usual eulerian framework ( fixed probe ) represents the structural viewpoint which is extensively studied in the literature while the lagrangian framework is associated to stochastic dynamical consideration , a statistical viewpoint .",
    "these two basic approaches are different both in their theoretical formulations and experimental technique , and compliment each other . in the eulerian frame , the acceleration , @xmath2 , is expressed in terms of the velocity field and its temporal and spatial derivatives , while in the lagrangian frame the acceleration is @xmath3 , in terms of the lagrangian velocity , @xmath4 , of fluid particle with the coordinates @xmath5 ; @xmath6 . in the present paper",
    "we will use the lagrangian framework .",
    "measurement of the time series @xmath7 for individual tracer particle in a turbulent flow to a high resolution requires very high speed imaging sensors , and allows one to compute its instantaneous lagrangian velocity and lagrangian acceleration  @xcite .",
    "experimental data are collected for such individual particles moving in the approximately isotropic and homogeneous turbulent flow domain .    with delta - correlated noises the langevin type model of one of the two components of acceleration is markovian ( no memory effects ) so that the well established fokker - planck approximation can be used to link the dynamical framework to a statistical ( pdf ) approach .",
    "thus , one can study stationary solution of the associated fokker - planck equation for the acceleration one - point probability density function @xmath8 under the assumption of balance between the energy injected by driving forces at large scales and the energy dissipated by viscous processes at small scales ( a statistically steady state ) .    in the case",
    "when stationary probability distribution can be found exactly one can make further analysis without referring to dynamics .",
    "the resulting stationary probability density function of the component of acceleration , @xmath9 , contains some free parameters inherited from the langevin type equation .",
    "this pdf is the main prediction of the model which can be directly fitted to experimental data or direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "the random intensity of noise ( rin ) approach  @xcite makes a simple extension of the above langevin type model of the lagrangian acceleration .",
    "the main idea of this approach is to use the presence of two well separated characteristic time scales ( kolmogorov time scale and the integral time scale ) of the system and assume that parameters entering the resulting acceleration pdf , such as intensities of the noises , are not constant but fluctuate at _ large _ time scale and depend on lagrangian velocity fluctuations .",
    "effectively , we approximate the time evolution of acceleration by separating fast and slow time varying parts , and thus account for large time scales which are usually ignored . this improves the delta - correlation approximation of the noises adopted in the one - dimensional ldn type model mentioned above , provided that characteristic longtime fluctuations along the particle trajectory occur mainly at time scales much bigger than the dissipative time scale , typically at the integral time scale .    in general , one can assume hierarchy of a number of characteristic time scales associated to the discrete cascade picture with characteristic times of the flow modes of descending eddies .",
    "however , in the present paper we simplify the consideration by extending the large time scale up to the lagrangian integral time scale in order to make it more analytically tractable , in accord to the presence of two basic characteristic scales in the kolmogorov 1941 ( k41 ) picture of fully developed turbulence , and the recent lagrangian experimental data  @xcite .    in the context of stochastic equation",
    "the delta - correlated multiplicative noise provides short - time acceleration bursts the origin of which is thought to be due to the presence of very intense vortical structures relatively slowly varying in time .",
    "these structures make an essential contribution to the acceleration statistics , namely , to the tails of acceleration probability density function , making it highly non - gaussian .",
    "accounting for longtime fluctuations of the parameters corresponds to an accounting for fluctuations of intensity of the vortical structures , intensity of noisy incoherent background , and their cross correlation .",
    "the key point is then to identify distributions of the parameters .",
    "we will discuss it below and further in sec .",
    "[ sec : conditionalmean ] .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that accounting for the fluctuating parameter @xmath10 in the chi - square langevin model characterized by the sole delta - correlated gaussian additive noise  @xcite was recently found  @xcite to yield a stationary probability density function of the same power law form as in simple langevin model characterized by the delta - correlated gaussian additive _ and multiplicative _ noises with constant parameters and linear drift term . in other words ,",
    "the chi - square distributed fluctuations of @xmath10 appears to be mimicking the presence of the multiplicative noise in this particular case .    in the first approximation",
    "the velocity statistics in the lagrangian frame is taken as usually stationary and gaussian , partially because one can easily deal with it analytically . due to the recent lagrangian experiments  @xcite",
    "the distribution of lagrangian velocity is approximately gaussian for both the @xmath11 and @xmath12 components ( the flatness is 3.2 and 2.8 respectively as compared with 3 for a gaussian ) and their characteristic time variation is of the order of kolmogorov time , yet velocity fluctuations exceed root - mean square ( rms ) velocity that is usually associated to large scales .",
    "this can be understood as a manifestation of the importance of nonlocal ( inter - scale ) interactions when considering small scales .",
    "it is important to note here that the lagrangian velocity autocorrelation , as well as the autocorrelation of _ absolute _ value of velocity increments in time , was found to cross zero at the integral time scale , while the _ full signed _ velocity increments in time decay at the kolmogorov time scale  @xcite .    under the assumption that the parameters are given independent random variables ( large scales are weakly affected by small scales in a three - dimensional high - reynolds - number flow since the former",
    "are local in the wave number space ) characterized by stationary statistics , the stationary probability density function obtained from the fokker - planck equation makes a sense and is treated as the distribution _",
    "conditional _ on small scale velocity fluctuations through assumed dependencies of the parameters on @xmath13 .    by this way the rin approach enables one to study acceleration statistics conditional on velocity fluctuations , @xmath14 .",
    "the velocity fluctuations ( large scales ) are assumed to be decoupled from the acceleration ( small scales ) at high taylor microscale reynolds numbers , @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that such an approach is in agreement with the heisenberg - yaglom picture of developed turbulence which relates statistics of the fluid particle acceleration to statistics of velocity fluctuations on the basis of k41 scaling theory , with pressure gradient contribution to the acceleration variance strongly dominating over that of viscous forces , in the inertial range .",
    "the long - standing heisenberg - yaglom scaling , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is rms velocity , was recently confirmed to a high accuracy for seven orders of magnitude in @xmath18 , and was found to be broken for @xmath19  @xcite due to increasing coupling of the acceleration to large scales of the flow .    also , it should be mentioned that a similar approach , with the variance of intermittent variable viewed phenomenologically as a parameter which follows log - normal distribution , was considered by castaing , gagne , and hopfinger  @xcite . from this point of view rin models",
    "can be referred to as castaing type models .",
    "however , the castaing model does not refer to a stochastic dynamical approach , which is an important ingredient of the lagrangian modeling , and does not relate the fluctuating parameter to velocity fluctuations .    in the rin approach the marginal ( i.e. , unconditional ) stationary probability density function @xmath9",
    "is found simply by integrating out @xmath13 in the conditional distribution @xmath20 with ( gaussian ) distributed @xmath13 .",
    "this procedure requires prior determination of dependencies of the parameters on velocity fluctuations @xmath13 .",
    "particularly , in the rin approach to the ldn type model the assumption that the additive noise intensity @xmath21 depends on absolute value of velocity fluctuations @xmath13 in an _ exponential _ way , @xmath22 , was found  @xcite to imply a set of conditional probability density functions @xmath20 and the conditional acceleration variance @xmath23 which are in a good qualitative agreement with the recent experimental data on the conditional statistics of the @xmath11 component of acceleration obtained by mordant , crawford , and bodenschatz  @xcite , for the normalized velocity fluctuations @xmath24 ranging from 0 to 3 .",
    "this issue will be discussed further in sec .  [",
    "sec : conditionalmean ] .    the effect of nonzero cross correlation @xmath25 between the additive and multiplicative noises ( which models the relationship between small - scale stretching and vorticity  @xcite and can be seen as a small skewness of the probability density function of the ` longitudinal ' , i.e. , pointed along the lagrangian velocity , component of acceleration ) has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for an illustrative purpose .",
    "the experimental unconditional acceleration probability density function reveals small skewness that has been fitted by using the value @xmath26 .",
    "the observed very small skewness of the probability density functions for the @xmath11 component of acceleration can be assigned to anisotropy of the studied @xmath27 flow  @xcite rather than to the effect of correlation between stretching and vorticity .",
    "particularly , it was found that , in addition to the dependence @xmath28 , the parameter @xmath25 should also depend on velocity fluctuations to meet the experimentally observed appreciable increase of the conditional mean acceleration , @xmath29 , with the increase of @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the form of functional dependence @xmath31 was assumed to produce a weak effect but it was not specified .    in the present paper",
    "we fill this gap and demonstrate that ( rather strong ) exponential dependence , @xmath32 , is in a good qualitative agreement with the experimental data .",
    "this fit is of a pure illustrative character since the observed nonzero conditional mean acceleration is due to the anisotropy of the studied flow .",

    "( [ a4 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we use the exact distribution ( [ plaval ] ) as a starting point .    since the experimental unconditional distribution @xmath9 and the experimental conditional distribution @xmath20 at @xmath55 are approximately of the same stretched exponential form  @xcite we use the result of our fit  @xcite of the probability density function ( [ plaval ] ) to the unconditional distribution @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "this implied the following set of values of the real parameters : @xmath56    it should be stressed that a fit to the experimental _ conditional _ distribution @xmath20 at @xmath55 would yield a different particular set of values of the parameters .",
    "the above fit is however justified as a first step , as we are mainly interested in a qualitative analysis . also , the reason that we do not use a fit to the experimental @xmath20 at @xmath55 presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is an illustrative character of the curve and that the shown range , @xmath57 , is too small to capture information encoded in the long tails that is essential for an accurate determination of the fit parameters .    following the rin approach",
    ", we will assume that the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath25 entering ( [ plaval ] ) are stochastic and depend on velocity fluctuations @xmath13 .",
    "in the present paper , the remaining parameters , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , are taken to be fixed at the fitted values given in ( [ set ] ) .",
    "the exponential form of @xmath62 has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and was found to be relevant from both the theoretical and experimental points of view .",
    "namely , for gaussian distributed @xmath13 the positive parameter @xmath21 is log - normally distributed variable that corresponds to kolmogorov 1962 ( k62 ) refined theory which assumes log - normal distribution of the stochastic energy dissipation rate per unit mass , @xmath63 , to which we relate @xmath21 due to the k62 universality hypothesis , in the inertial range .",
    "the following remark is in order .",
    "more precisely , instead of the stochastic energy dissipation rate it seems reasonable to use here the stochastic energy flux through the surface of the domain of a given spatial scale .",
    "the fluctuating energy flux is related to the nonlinear term in the navier - stokes equation which dominates in the inertial range for high - reynolds - number flow , while the fluctuating energy dissipation rate is associated specifically to the dissipative scale . under the stationarity condition ( the mean energy dissipation @xmath64 is equal to the injected energy ) , the time variation of the energy contained in the given scale is defined by the fluctuating energy flux minus fluctuating part of the energy dissipation rate at the given scale .    from the experimental point of view , the exponential form of @xmath62 leading to the log - normal rin model yields the acceleration probability density function with one free parameter which is in a good agreement with tails of the experimental acceleration distribution  @xcite .",
    "clearly , this approach builds first approximation since the stochastic energy dissipation rate is known to follow log - normal distribution only approximately . also , we note that the stochastic energy dissipation rate is positive while velocity fluctuations @xmath13 are not .",
    "hence one is motivated to seek for specific model forms of the dependence between two stochastic variables ( monotonic borel function ) , among which we choose an exponential form for the function @xmath62 that means the same form for the function @xmath65 as we will see below .",
    "statistical properties of the stochastic energy dissipation rate and of the velocity fluctuations are not the same .",
    "however , they are related to each other , particularly due to the wellknown k62 similarity hypothesis .",
    "we assume the relationship @xmath66 in a statistical sense which is evidently insensitive to the details related to a power law functional dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath63 , i.e. , insensitive to this particular type of nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "this can be viewed a manifestation of the universality .",
    "the choice of an exponential dependence for @xmath62 and a power law dependence for @xmath67 implies the relationship @xmath68 , by which we model the nonlinear relationship between @xmath63 and @xmath13 .",
    "it should be stresses that only absolute value of @xmath13 contributes the acceleration probability density function , for normally distributed @xmath13 .",
    "the framework for dealing with more general situation has been recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    from the phenomenological point of view",
    ", the exponential form , @xmath69 , was found to provide appreciable increase of the conditional acceleration variance @xmath23 with increasing @xmath30 that meets the experimental data  @xcite .    guided by the above observations the simplest choice is to try an exponential dependence for @xmath31 , in a phenomenological way .",
    "particularly , in the present paper we take [ exponenta ] ( u)=e^|u| , ( u)=-0.005e^3|u| , which recover the values given in eq .",
    "( [ set ] ) at @xmath70 .",
    "the procedure is to refine the guess on @xmath31 depending on the result .",
    "of course , the determination of functional forms for both @xmath62 and @xmath31 is essentially ( k62 ) phenomenological but in general this approach is justified from the turbulence dynamics and allows us to deal with the conditional statistics of the fluid particle acceleration , which exhibits a quite nontrivial behavior .",
    "it should be emphasized that the very model is justified by the navier - stokes equation based ldn model  @xcite , and the very dependence of the additive noise intensity @xmath21 ( and the cross correlation @xmath25 ) on @xmath13 is specific to the ldn model , in which the additive noise was found to depend on small - scale velocities coupled to large - scale velocities .",

    "it is however interesting to note that dns also reveals slight departures from zero .",
    "probably this is due to approximate character of the isotropy used in the dns .",
    "the reason that we make this illustration in the present paper is that for the components of acceleration which are aligned to trajectory of fluid particle , some skewness of the acceleration distributions may be present .",
    "namely , for the component pointed transverse to the velocity , @xmath25 is zero by construction while for the component pointed along the velocity it is nonzero .",
    "we remind that the acceleration is calculated due to lagrangian longitudinal velocity increments , @xmath93 , in the dissipative time - scale @xmath94 .",
    "it is known that lagrangian longitudinal velocity structure functions of odd order are small but not zero for inertial time - scales so that small skewness of the velocity increments pdf should be observed .",

    ", the condition that one should avoid the emerging ill - defined character can be understood as that in addition to @xmath62 and @xmath31 some of the other parameters should depend on @xmath13 in certain way to provide well - defined distributions for any @xmath13 .",

    "this issue is of much importance to the present formalism but it is beyond the scope of the present paper and can be considered elsewhere .",
