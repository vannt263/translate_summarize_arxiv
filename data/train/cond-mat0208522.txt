    "2 the two - dimensional classical @xmath0 model exhibits a non standard behaviour . long - range order of spins with continuous symmetries is indeed forbidden according to the mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite , and thus there is no spontaneous magnetisation at finite temperature .",
    "the transition is governed by unbinding of topological defects .",
    "the low - temperature regime was investigated by berezinskii  @xcite and the mechanism of unbinding of vortices was studied by kosterlitz and thouless  @xcite using renormalization group methods . for reviews , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the notations are specified below : we consider a @xmath5 @xmath0-model on a square lattice with two - components spin variables @xmath6 located at the sites @xmath7 of a lattice @xmath8 of linear extent @xmath9 .",
    "the spins interact through the usual nearest - neighbour ferromagnetic interaction -=k_w__w_w+ , [ ham ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a unit vector in the @xmath12direction .    at low temperature ,",
    "the system is partially ordered , apart from the existence of vortices , which appear in pairs in increasing number with increasing temperature . in the low - temperature limit ,",
    "the effect of vortices can be neglected and the behaviour is governed by spin - wave excitations , obtained after expanding the cosine .",
    "this harmonic approximation is justified , provided that the spin disorientation remains small , i.e. at sufficiently low temperature . within this approximation",
    ", the quadratic energy in the boltzmann factor leads to a gaussian equilibrium distribution and the two - point correlation function becomes  @xcite _ w_1_w_2|w_1-w_2|^-1/2k , hence ( t)=k_bt/2j.[eta - sw ] when the temperature increases , the influence of vortices becomes more prominent , producing a deviation from the linear spin - wave contribution in equation  ( [ eta - sw ] ) , but the order parameter correlation function still decays algebraically with an exponent @xmath13 which depends on the temperature .",
    "the existence of such a scale - invariant power - law decay of the correlation function is the signature of a continuous line of fixed points at low temperatures . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the end point of this critical line where the topological transition takes place : at the transition temperature @xmath14 ( usually called berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless critical temperature ) , the pairs are broken and the system becomes completely disordered .",
    "this very peculiar topological transition is characterised by essential singularities when approaching the critical point from the high temperature phase , and at @xmath14 the correlation function exponent takes the value @xmath3  @xcite . in order to recover this result",
    ", many numerical studies were performed in the last decade using monte carlo simulations ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but the analysis was made difficult by the existence of logarithmic corrections , e.g. _",
    "l|w_12|^-(|w_12|)^/2 , [ eq9 ] at @xmath14  @xcite . due to these logarithmic corrections which make the fits quite difficult ,",
    "the value of @xmath1 at @xmath14 was a bit controversial as shown in table  1 of reference  @xcite .",
    "the resort to large - scale simulations , up to systems as large as @xmath15 , was then needed in order to confirm this picture  @xcite .",
    "recently , we proposed a rather different approach  @xcite which is easily implemented .",
    "we use the covariance law of correlation functions under the mapping of a two - dimensional system confined inside a square onto the half - infinite plane .",
    "the scaling dimensions are then obtained through a simple power - law fit when the correlators are expressed as functions of conveniently rescaled variables .",
    "the shape effects are explicitly encoded in the conformal mapping .",
    "this is the crucial point , since then even very small systems lead to promising results .",
    "we may then determine accurately the bulk correlation function exponent @xmath1 at @xmath14 but also , by choosing convenient boundary conditions , the surface critical exponent which describes the decay of the correlation function parallel to a free surface , @xmath2 .",
    "2 for a scale - invariant system at its critical point ( which also exhibits the properties of isotropic scaling and short - range interactions ) , conformal invariance enable to include explicitly the shape dependence in the functional expression of the correlators through the conformal covariance transformation under a mapping @xmath16 : _",
    "w_1_w_2=|w(z_1)|^-x_|w(z_2)|^-x _ _ z_1_z_2 . [ covconf ] the functional expression of the correlation function inside the square geometry @xmath7 simply follows the mapping @xmath16 which realizes the conformal transformation of the half - plane @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) inside a square @xmath19 of size @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) with free boundary conditions along the four edges .",
    "this is realized by a schwarz - christoffel transformation  @xcite w(z)=l2kf(z , k ) , z = sn(2kwl ) .",
    "[ eq - schchr ] here , @xmath23 is the elliptic integral of the first kind , @xmath24 the jacobian elliptic sine ,",
    "@xmath25 the complete elliptic integral of the first kind , and the modulus @xmath26 depends on the aspect ratio of @xmath8 and is here solution of @xmath27 . using the mapping  ( [ eq - schchr ] ) ,",
    "one obtains the local rescaling factor in equation  ( [ covconf ] ) , @xmath28^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "one simply has now to include in equation  ( [ covconf ] ) the expected behaviour of @xmath29 in the half - infinite geometry in order to get the functional expression of the corresponding quantity in the confined system .",
    "for example in the semi - infinite geometry @xmath17 ( the free surface being defined by the @xmath30 axis ) , the two - point correlation function is fixed up to an unknown scaling function : fixing one point @xmath31 close to the free surface ( @xmath32 ) of the half - infinite plane , and leaving the second point @xmath33 explore the rest of the lattice , the following behaviour is expected : _",
    "z_1_z_2 _ ~(y_1-y_2)^-x_(),[eq : g ] with @xmath34 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath35 of the universal scaling function @xmath36 is constrained by the special conformal transformation  @xcite , and its asymptotic behaviour is implied by scaling e.g. @xmath37 when @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the surface scaling dimension . keeping @xmath40 fixed inside the square , the two - point correlation function becomes    @xmath41^{-x_\\sigma } \\psi(\\omega)\\nonumber\\\\    & &       \\kappa(w)= { \\rm im}\\left[{\\rm sn}\\frac{2kw}{l } \\right]\\times          \\left| \\left(1-{\\rm sn}^2\\frac{2kw}{l }          \\right )   \\left ( 1-k^2{\\rm sn}^2\\frac{2kw}{l } \\right)\\right|^{-1/2 } , \\label{eqkappa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    2 where @xmath42 specifies that the boundary conditions ( bcs ) are chosen free along the edges of the square .",
    "this expression is correct up to a constant amplitude determined by @xmath43 which is kept fixed , but the function @xmath44 is still varying with the location of the second point , @xmath7 .",
    "this makes this expression not so useful in practice ( see e.g. reference  @xcite for an application ) . in order to cancel the role of the unknown scaling function , it is more convenient to work with a density profile @xmath45 in the presence of symmetry breaking surface fields @xmath46 on some parts of the boundary @xmath47 of the lattice @xmath8 . in the case of fixed - free bcs denoted by @xmath48 ( the spins located on the @xmath49 half axis",
    "are kept fixed while those of the @xmath50 are free ) , burkhardt and xue have shown in the case of ising and potts models that in the half - plane the order parameter profile obeys the following expression  @xcite : m_+f(z)=y^-/2()^_/2 . in the square geometry , the fixed - free bcs correspond to keeping the spins fixed for @xmath51 , and the corresponding profile is expected to obey the following ansatz :    @xmath52^{-x_\\sigma}[\\mu(w)]^{x_\\sigma^1 } , \\nonumber\\\\ %   & &       \\kappa(w)= { \\rm im}\\left[{\\rm sn}\\frac{2kw}{l } \\right]\\times %         \\left| \\left(1-{\\rm sn}^2\\frac{2kw}{l } %         \\right )   \\left ( 1-k^2{\\rm sn}^2\\frac{2kw}{l } \\right)\\right|^{-1/2},\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\mu(w)= \\frac { 1}{\\sqrt 2}\\left(1+{\\rm re}\\left[{\\rm sn}\\frac{2kw}{l } \\right]\\times          \\left|\\   \\!{\\rm sn}\\frac{2kw}{l}\\right|^{-1}\\right)^{1/2 } \\label{eqkappamu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    2 where @xmath53 was defined in equation  ( [ eqkappa ] ) .",
    "in this paper we will essentially apply equation  ( [ eqkappamu ] ) in order to determine the critical exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 at the kt point . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bulk exponent was deduced from a similar analysis of the order parameter profiles in a square - shaped system with fully fixed bcs .",
    "2 the application of the simple power - law in equation  ( [ eqkappamu ] ) requires a relatively precise numerical determination of the order parameter profile of the @xmath5 @xmath0 model confined inside a square with mixed fixed - free boundary conditions . fixing the spins along some part @xmath47 of the boundary , e.g. @xmath54 , plays the role of ordering surface fields @xmath55 .",
    "the resort to cluster update algorithms ( wolff algorithm here ) is necessary in order to prevent the critical slowing down : the central idea is the identification of clusters of sites using bond variables connected to the spin configuration .",
    "the spins of the clusters are then updated and the algorithm is particularly efficient if the percolation threshold of the bond process occurs at the transition temperature of the spin model .",
    "this ensures the updating of clusters of all sizes in a single mc sweep . for the @xmath0 model , ising variables defined in the wolff algorithm by the sign of the projection of the spin variables along some random direction .",
    "the bonds are then introduced through the kasteleyn - fortuin random graph representation .",
    "the percolation threshold for these bonds coincides with the kosterlitz - thouless point  @xcite , which guarantees the efficiency of the wolff cluster updating scheme  @xcite at @xmath14 .",
    "when one uses particular boundary conditions , with fixed spins along some surface as required here , the wolff algorithm should become less efficient , since close to criticality the unique cluster will often reach the boundary and no update is made in this case . to prevent this",
    ", we use the symmetry properties of the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) : even when the cluster reaches the fixed boundaries , it is updated , and the order parameter profile is then measured with respect to the new direction of the boundary spins , @xmath56 .",
    "the new configuration reached has the right statistical weight .    using this procedure ,",
    "we discard @xmath57 sweeps for thermalization , and the measurements are performed on @xmath57 production sweeps . the simulations at @xmath14 on a typical system of size @xmath58 takes a few hours on a standard pc with 733 mhz processor , to get a smooth profile as shown in figure  1 .",

    "2 in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that the logarithmic corrections at the kt point are negligible for the order parameter profile with fixed bcs . assuming that there will be no substantial difference for fixed - free bcs",
    ", we perform a fit of @xmath62 against the two - dimensional linear expression , @xmath63 , as expected from equation  ( [ eqkappamu ] ) . the value obtained for the bulk correlation function exponent",
    "@xmath1 will be a test for the absence of logarithmic corrections .",
    "the simulations are performed at the value @xmath64 found in the literature , e.g. in ref .",
    "the fit leads to accurate determinations of both exponents for different system sizes ranging between @xmath65 and @xmath66 . although it would easily be possible to produce simulations for larger systems",
    ", there is no need here , since the results are already quite stable as shown in table  1 and in figure  2 .",
