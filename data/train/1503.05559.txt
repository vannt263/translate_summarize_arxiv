    "the evolution of galaxies is likely dependent on halo mass and regulated by baryonic feedback cycles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the fits and stacked data for both our field and cluster galaxies are consistent with the previous results of mosdef @xcite , kbss - mosfire @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the low mass end of the field galaxies marginally deviate away from the kbss - mosfire fit , but is consistent with their binned data ( not shown ) .",
    "any observed minor differences could due to sample selection biases ( kbss - mosfire is rest - frame ultraviolet selected while mosdef and zfire are rest - frame optical selected ) or how detection significance levels and fits were conducted .",
    "however , given that our cluster and field data are consistent with all previous works , further validates the lack of a difference between field and cluster galaxies .      to further examine",
    "if the environment of galaxies actually influences their metallicities , we perform a similar analysis using cosmological simulations .",
    "the simulations are performed with a gadget-3 based hydrodynamical code that includes important baryon physics such as star formation , feedback from supernovae and agn , and chemical enrichment from type  ii and ia supernovae , and asymptotic giant branch stars with kroupa imf ( see * ? ? ?",

    "metallicities derived for kroupa imf are virtually identical for to those derived for a chabrier imf .",
    "the input nucleosynthesis yields are in excellent agreement with the observed elemental abundances in the milky way galaxy from carbon to zinc @xcite .",
    "different from the @xcite simulations , we include agn feedback , whereby agn - driven winds eject metals from massive galaxies to the intergalactic medium , and some less - massive galaxies undergo external enrichment depending on the environment .",
    "however we find that for the mass - metallicity relation , the effect of agn is small and the trend originate mainly from supernova / hypernova - driven galactic winds , which is much larger in less - massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "the simulations are run for a 25@xmath39  mpc box with two different initial conditions .",
    "the cluster simulation is chosen from ten realization to have a strongest central concentration , which gives the most massive galaxy with the stellar mass @xmath40 @xcite at @xmath41 , while the field simulation is same as used in @xcite and does not contain any central concentrations .",
    "the stellar masses are estimated by fitting a core - srsic profile , and the oxygen abundances are measured in 15@xmath39  kpc weighted by the star formation rates of gas particles to be comparable to our emission - line observations . at @xmath41 , the mass - metallicity relations of simulated galaxies are in good agreement with the observed mass - metallicity relations both for stellar and gas - phase metallicities @xcite .",
    "these relations evolve as a function of time , with lower metallicities and a steeper slope at higher redshifts ( taylor & kobayashi 2015 , in prep . ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : simmmr ] shows the mass - metallicity relations of the `` cluster '' and `` field '' simulations at @xmath0 .",
    "we apply an observationally - based detection limit on the simulated mass - metallicity distribution .",
    "the n2-based metallicity measurement is confined by the detection limit of ] .",
    "based on a few simple assumptions , @xcite used the sfr - mass relation , flux detection limit and redshift to determine observational detection limit on the mass - metallicity relation . for the zfire survey ,",
    "our typical 3@xmath18 flux limit is 1.8@xmath1910@xmath20  ergs / s/@xmath21 resulting in the limiting relation of : 12+log(o / h )  >  @xmath42log(m@xmath43/m@xmath12)+10.371 .",
    "this observational detection limit is important for understanding the incompleteness and biases due to observational limitations .",

    "both the field and cluster galaxies exhibit similar mass - metallicity relationships within 1@xmath18 .",

    "note that there is an @xmath44dex offset in the zero - point between simulations and observations , which can be partly attributed to the uncertain normalization in metallicity measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "high redshift protoclusters are ideal laboratories to study the possible influences of environment on galaxies .",
    "it is important to establish whether the environment can affect chemical evolution via restricting inflow and outflow , which may be responsible for galaxies migrating from the blue to the red sequence , or if a galaxys chemical evolution is established early and is solely dependent on its internal evolutionary processes .",
    "the environment may already be affecting the morphological properties of galaxies at @xmath0 . in our cluster ,",
    "quiescent galaxies have similar colors and sizes relative to field quiescent galaxies , however , cluster star - forming galaxies are larger and redder on average when compared to field star - forming galaxies  suggesting environment can transform some galaxy properties at this early stage of formation @xcite .",
    "it is a concern when searching for metallicity differences as a function of environment that the precise metallicities derived for high redshift galaxies are likely incorrect due to their different ism conditions relative to @xmath41 galaxies  where emission - line metallicity indicators are calibrated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we further show that both our field and cluster galaxies have consistent mass - metallicity relations when compared to other field galaxy surveys at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "although we can not rule out weak environmental trends in chemical enrichment , our analysis shows that the difference between field and cluster galaxies in the mass - metallicity relation is less than 0.02dex .",
    "our simulations have shown that cluster galaxies may be marginally more metal rich than field galaxies by at most 0.1dex ( although consistent within the scatter ) .",
    "this could be due to the removal of gas from the outskirts of galaxies which can produce an observed increase in metallicity by @xmath60.1dex @xcite or due to the shorter gas recycling times in denser environments @xcite . however , given that the offset is small , it is suggestive that these effects do not play a significant role in the chemical evolution of galaxies , especially given that there is no observed differences in mass - metallicity relation of field and cluster galaxies at @xmath41 @xcite .    our results from the simulations and observations are suggestive that environmental effects , if present , are secondary to the ongoing internal processes within @xmath46 galaxies that are likely governed by halo mass .",
