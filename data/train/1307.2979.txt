    "the equilibrium behavior and the equipartition of energy between various degrees of freedom in nonlinear , nonintegrable discrete systems has attracted considerable interest since the seminal study of fermi , pasta and ulam @xcite . in hamiltonain systems with conserved number of excitations ( waves )",
    "the maximum entropy principle suggests that in the final state of thermal equilibrium the statistics of the system is given by grand canonical gibbs distribution with the effective `` temperature '' and `` chemical potential '' @xcite .",
    "however unlike the conventional statistical mechanics the effective temperature of this grand - canonical distribution depends on the initial position in the phase space and for certain regions can become negative making the distribution non - normalizable .",
    "such regime is commonly attributed to the emergence of stable , localized , nonlinear structures corresponding to solitons in continuous systems @xcite and discrete breathers @xcite in discrete systems . from the point of view of the wave turbulence theory",
    "@xcite the resulting equilibrium distribution provides stationary rayleigh - jeans spectra @xcite .",
    "also thermalization of light in nonlinear multimode waveguides and cavities has recently attracted attention in the context of classical optical wave condensation @xcite .    here",
    "we will study the phenomenon of thermalization in the context of light propagation in a system of coupled nonlinear optical waveguides but the results can have wider applicability beyond the scope of the nonlinear optics . when the individual waveguide modes are strongly localized the nonlinear propagation of light is most commonly modelled by the discrete nonlinear schrodinger equation ( dnlse ) @xcite .",
    "in fact most studies of thermalization in nonlinear _",
    "discrete _ systems have concentrated on dnlse in one @xcite or two @xcite dimensions .",
    "thanks the plethora of the results in the field of `` dnlse thermalization '' the structure of the final equilibrium state and the thermodynamical conditions for the occurrence of discrete breathers are now well understood . among numerous discoveries in this area",
    "we would like to point reader s attention to the universal correlations in 1d systems of optical waveguides predicted in @xcite in the limit when the nonlinearity dominates over the linear coupling . in this limit",
    "the effective dimensionless temperature turns out to be a universal constant independent on system parameters ( provided that the initial state is characterised by uniform intensities ) and the same universality is also manifested in the shape of the field correlation function .    in this paper",
    "we would like to focus on a much less studied model , namely , the thermalization of two coupled fields in the presence of the four - wave mixing ( fwm ) @xcite . in the context of nonlinear optics the situation corresponds to the propagation of polarized light in the birefringent material @xcite or mode interaction from different floquet - bloch bands @xcite . here",
    "we will concentrate on the first case , however the results presented here are quite general and can be applied to other nolinearly coupled systems . in order to give reference to the real - world units we use algaas as an common example of a material with cubic symmetry and fused silica as the corresponding example of isotropic crystal .",
    "the wave dynamics of the two orthogonally polarized fields is given by the following pair of coupled equations @xcite :    [ vector - dnlse ] @xmath1    in the above equations , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are slowly varying filed envelopes of the te and tm polarized waves , @xmath4 is the polarization mode dispersion constant , @xmath5 is the vacuum wave vector , @xmath6 is the linear birefringence ( @xmath7 for algaas ) , @xmath8 is the coupling constant ( @xmath9 mm@xmath10 ) , @xmath11 is the nonlinear coefficient , @xmath12 is the kerr coefficient ( @xmath13 @xmath14/w for algaas ) , @xmath15 is the linear refractive index ( @xmath16 for algaas ) .",
    "the dimensionless constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the relative strength of self- and cross - phase modulation ( spm and xpm ) .",
    "if one puts @xmath19 the system ( [ vector - dnlse ] ) breaks into two independent scalar dnlse equations .",
    "we can restrict ourselves to the case of positive coupling @xmath20 since the case of negative coupling can be recovered via a standard staggered transformation @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the change of sign in the nonlinearity can be also be compensated via more complicated transformation which involves staggering , complex conjugation and swapping : @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "both transformations only affect the field correlation functions and phase distributions ( and not e.g. the intensity distributions ) in a controlled way and here without loss of generality we will also restrict ourselves to the case of positive nonlinearity . in this paper",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions although in the thermodynamic limit @xmath25 this choice is not essential .",
    "note in passing that continuous analogues of system ( [ vector - dnlse ] ) were studied in @xcite with regards to pulse propagation in optical fibers .    in any chosen nonlinear medium",
    "the dimensionless xpm and fwm constants , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are not independent and 3 possible cases of interest can be envisaged @xcite :    1 .",
    "anisotropic cubic medium ( e.g. algaas ) : @xmath26 .",
    "generic isotropic medium : @xmath27 .",
    "3 .   isotropic cubic medium ( e.g. fused silica ) : @xmath28 , @xmath29 .    we will refer to cases ( a ) and ( b),(c ) as isotropic and anisotropic correspondingly .",
    "the system is hamiltonian with the hamiltonian :    @xmath30    which is a natural conserved quantity in the system while the additional integral of motion is provided by the total pulse power ( proportional to the sum of local intensities ) @xmath31 additionally in the absence of the four - wave mixing ( @xmath32 ) the individual powers in each polarization @xmath33 and @xmath34 are conserved .    in the state of thermodynamic equilibrium",
    "the stationary field distribution @xmath35 maximizes the entropy @xmath36 .",
    "however the nonlinear evolution always takes place on the shell @xmath37 and @xmath38 which introduces two constraints for the optimization problem .",
    "the solution then represents a grand canonical gibbs distribution ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath39\\ ] ] where the lagrange multipliers @xmath40 and @xmath41 play the roles of the `` inverse temperature '' and `` chemical potential '' respectively while the normalizing factor @xmath42 has the familiar meaning of the partition function .",
    "the assumption of field thermalization implies that instead of averaging the dynamics of the system ( [ vector - dnlse ] ) over a long interval of @xmath43 one can compute the same averages via the equilibrium gibbs measure ( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "however from the point of view of the nonlinear optical waveguides it is impractical to use averaging over large distances since it requires optical waveguides that are way too long .",
    "instead the averaging can be understood as averaging over _ disordered initial conditions _ that can be be experimentally controlled @xcite .",
    "this brings about the notion of the thermalization distance @xcite @xmath44 after which the information about the initial state of the system is forgotten and the averaging over the initial conditions is equivalent to gibbs averaging . in our treatment",
    "we will assume ( unless otherwise specified ) that the initial amplitudes for both te and tm components are constant @xmath45 , @xmath46 while the phases are uncorrelated uniformly distributed random variables .",
    "such assumption is not necessary but it simplifies the calculation of the ensemble averages of the initial hamiltonian and power .",
    "the knowledge of the partition function @xmath47 $ ] allows one to calculate an average energy per waveguide @xmath48 and the average intensity per waveguide @xmath49 . on the other hand",
    "such averages must correspond to their initial values @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( averaged over the disordered initial conditions ) since for each realization of the disorder these are conserved integrals of motion .",
    "indeed , from ( [ gibbs ] ) it follows that @xmath52 for each set of phase - averaged initial conditions ( i.e. given pair @xmath53 ) the above two transcendental equations yield the effective inverse temperature @xmath40 and the chemical potential , @xmath41 . as in the scalar case @xcite the necessary condition for the gibbs distribution ( [ gibbs ] ) to be normalizable",
    "is the positiveness of the temperature , @xmath54 .",
    "thus the curve @xmath55 in the @xmath53 diagram represents a natural boundary between the conventional thermalization region ( @xmath54 ) and the area where @xmath56 and the energy is localized in a form of discrete breathers that have been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to introduce complex amplitudes and phases @xmath57 , @xmath58 with @xmath59 being the phase difference between the two orthogonal components .",
    "the case @xmath60 ( @xmath61-integer ) corresponds to the linear polarization in @xmath62-the waveguide , @xmath63 , @xmath64 describe circular polarization etc .",
    "this notation corresponds to the _ jones description _ of polarization ( see e.g. @xcite ) . to calculate the partition function @xmath42",
    "one needs to integrate the gibbs exponential in ( [ gibbs ] ) with the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian - vect ] ) . in the new variables the integral takes the form :    @xmath65 % \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where we have collected all the nonlinear coupling terms as well as chemical potential in the nonlinear interaction part",
    "@xmath66 with @xmath67 \\\\ & -\\mu\\,(a+b ) \\end{split } \\label{hamiltonian - gamma}\\ ] ] while the linear waveguide coupling is given by the hamiltonian @xmath68 .",
    "the gibbs distribution ( [ gibbs ] ) is normalizable when the partition function is finite . a close inspection of eq.([z - vector ] )",
    "reveals that in order to achieve this not only the temperature must be positive @xmath54 , but additionally the inequality @xmath69 this corresponds to possible thermalization for @xmath70 and for the anisotropic case @xmath71 this implies @xmath72 . the borderline case @xmath73 ( which includes the xpm without fwm @xmath74 , @xmath32 ) generally requires special treatment and we will not consider it here . the non - normalizable property of the gibbs distribution indicates the emergence of the localized structures , i.e",
    "the genuine equilibrium state now consist of high - amplitude discrete breather ( or several breathers if the system has not yet quite reached the equilibrium ) interacting weakly with a small quasilinear background thermalized at infinite temperature , @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "so here the statistical mechanics provides us with a clue as to the regions in the parameter space where the localized structures can be observed in principle @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will only study the thermalization regime where the inequality ( [ thermalization - ineq ] ) is fulfilled and the temperature is positive so that gibbs distribution ( [ gibbs ] ) is always normalizable .",
    "we leave the analysis of the localized structures for future studies although we will comment on these in the following section . since it is impossible to evaluate the partition function @xmath42 in the closed form we will study 3 different limiting regimes which for the scalar case were already analysed in refs .",
    "these regimes are : i ) low temperature limit @xmath75 ii ) high temperature limit @xmath76 ( which also serves as a borderline for emergence of localized structures ) and iii ) the anticontinuum ( high intensity ) regime when the effective nonlinearity parameter @xmath77 defined below in section [ sec : nonl ] is large , @xmath78 .",
    "it turns out that doubling the amount of degrees of freedom as compared to the scalar case has a significant impact on the statistical properties of system , ( [ vector - dnlse ] ) .",
    "we start our analysis with the first two regimes : @xmath75 and @xmath79 .",
    "the limit of @xmath75 corresponds to the configuration that minimizes the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian - vect ] ) subject to the given conserved pulse intensity per waveguide @xmath80 .",
    "if we restrict our search to a solution with constant amplitudes , phase shifts and locked state of polarization ( i.e. fixed @xmath81 ) the minimal configuration is achieved by the following field distribution : @xmath82 , @xmath83 where the amplitudes @xmath84 and @xmath85 as well as chemical potential ( i.e. the corresponding lagrange multiplier ) , @xmath41 , are given by : @xmath86 this solution exists only for not too low intensities , i.e. for @xmath87 and provides a low bound for the energy per waveguide : @xmath88 in the limit of zero birefringence , xpm and fwm , @xmath89 we get the energy as a sum of energies of two identical scalar dnlses with the average intensity per waveguide @xmath90 - which corresponds to the result of ref.@xcite . in fig .",

    "have been rescaled to the dimensionless multiples of @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .",

    "the answer is @xmath107 finally from eqs.([h - p ] ) we obtain in the leading approximation : @xmath108 the parabola @xmath109 provides the upper boundary @xmath55 for the thermalization region in the plane of parameters @xmath91 - see fig.[fig : h - p ] .",
    "interestingly enough it does not depend on the 4-wave mixing constant @xmath18 .",
    "in the following chapters we will adopt normalized units where the propagation distance is measured in units of coupling length @xmath110 .",
    "we will also assume that the intensities of both te and tm components are @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "we can also normalize the intensities of both components by the half of the initial intensity @xmath113 so that @xmath114 . in the new dimensionless units one must simply substitute @xmath115 for @xmath116 , @xmath117 for @xmath8 in the original coupled equations ( [ vector - dnlse ] ) and instead of the nonlinear coefficient @xmath118 one now has a dimensionless nonlinearity parameter @xmath119 . since in most common nonlinear materials and waveguide geometries",
    "the ratio @xmath115 is in the order of unity the parameter @xmath77 indeed gauges the relative strength of nonlinearity @xcite .    in this section",
    "we will be interested in the highly nonlinear regime , @xmath78 .",
    "the motivation for this is twofold .",
    "firstly , this regime permits almost full analytical treatment which is always helpful when studying the general properties of any nonlinear system and secondly , in ref.@xcite it was shown that in the scalar case this limit corresponds to the reciprocal temperature @xmath40 that does not depend on the value of parameter @xmath77 and is a universal constant ( in dimensionless units ) .",
    "the universality of the temperature in turn gives rise to a universal shape of the field correlation function .",
    "therefore it is interesting to see how this result changes in the vector case .",
    "one should expect that the dynamics and statistics in the vector case are much richer due to the doubled number of interacting degrees of freedom . here",
    "we will show that this is indeed the case .",
    "our main objects of interest will be the statistics of the intensity and polarization state of each waveguide as well as the distribution of the phase differences ( i.e. phase gradients in the continuous limit ) between the same components ( e.g. te ) of the adjacent waveguides together with the field correlation functions .",
    "it turns out that in the strongly nonlinear regime the statistics of the phase gradient is decoupled from those of the intensity and polarization .",
    "the latter are most conveniently described by using a popular alternative to the jones description of polarization , namely by introducing the four stokes parameters @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "they are related to the jones parameters via : @xmath121 the vector @xmath122 is called a stokes vector on a poincar sphere of radius @xmath123 .",
    "the components of the stokes vector for each waveguide are related to the polarisation state of the waveguide while its magnitude provides the total intensity carried by both field components .",
    "for example , linear polarization corresponds to the equatorial plane @xmath124 while the circular clockwise and anticlockwise polarizations correspond to the north and south poles @xmath125 .",
    "in what follows we will use both jones and stokes descriptions whichever is is more convenient .",
    "we will start our analysis with the anticontinuum limit when one can completely neglect both linear coupling and birefringence in eqs.([vector - dnlse ] ) .",
    "as will be seen later this corresponds to the initial stages of evolution of field distribution towards the final state of equilibrium .",
    "the absence of linear waveguide coupling makes field dynamics in each waveguide independent from the rest . therefore instead of considering the system of coupled field equations ( [ vector - dnlse ] ) one can analyze the dynamics in a single waveguide . in particular the first three stokes parameters obey the following equations ( the waveguide - index has been omitted for convenience ) : @xmath127 this system is completely integrable and its various special cases and generalizations ( like e.g. the inclusion of the birefringence terms @xmath128 ) have been extensively studied in literature both with connection to the nonlinear polarization dynamics @xcite in general and the dynamics of the polarization - locked vector solitons @xcite in particular .",
    "the complete integrability of system ( [ stokes - dyn ] ) is due to the existence of two integrals of motion of which the first is just the intensity , i.e. the zeroth stokes parameter , @xmath129 , and the second , @xmath130 , is related to the hamiltonian of the original system @xcite : @xmath131 in other words the dynamics of the system takes place on the intersection of the poincar sphere of radius @xmath129 and a hyperbolic ( or elliptic ) cylinder in the anisotropic case or a plane in the isotropic case given by the equation @xmath132 .",
    "one can obtain an autonomous equation for @xmath133 which has the form of a duffing oscillator equation in the anisotropic case @xcite and harmonic oscillator equation in the isotropic case @xcite ( see also appendix [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "the other two stokes parameters are recovered from eqs.([stokes - dyn ] ) while the phase of the te component can be determined by simple integration of the original field equations .",
    "since the system in the anticontinuum limit is completely integrable it does not thermalize , i.e. formula ( [ gibbs ] ) is inapplicable .",
    "instead one must use the exact solution for the stokes vector @xmath134 and average it directly over the initial conditions .",
    "as mentioned earlier we will assume that all waveguides initially have the same set of intensities , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and random , independent phases .",
    "from the definition of the stokes parameters ( [ stokes ] ) it follows that that initial value @xmath138 is fixed while the points @xmath139 are uniformly distributed on a circle of radius @xmath140 . in fig.[fig : anticont ] we show the evolution of the marginal probability density functions ( pdfs ) @xmath141 and @xmath142 for the anisotropic and anisotropic cases obtained by averaging the solution of system ( [ stokes - dyn ] ) over the initial phase distribution .",
    "the parameters @xmath143 were chosen to correspond to the algaas compounds in the anisotropic case and fused silica for the isotropic case .",
    "one can see that the structure of the histograms is very sensitive to both the values of @xmath144-coefficients and the symmetry of the initial condition .",
    "for example when the initial intensity is equally distributed between the components , i.e. @xmath145 , @xmath146 the marginal distribution @xmath147 shown in fig.[fig : anticont](a ) is 4-modal .",
    "it is largely confined to the initial circle of radius @xmath148 and the four maxima are at the points @xmath149 , @xmath150 . at the same time",
    "the marginal pdf for the first stokes parameter @xmath133 is sharply centered at zero ( fig.[fig : anticont](c ) ) i.e. for most initial realizations the symmetry between the components is preserved @xmath151 .",
    "we have also checked this property for different runs with different distances , @xmath43 ( not shown ) .",
    "this means that in the anticontinum limit for the anisotropic cubic crystal ( like e.g. algaas ) each given waveguide evolves into either linear or circular state of polarization - despite that no such preference existed in the initial conditions ( the distribution was uniform on the circle ) . in the isotropic case",
    "one can observe that although the distribution of @xmath142 is still sharply peaked around zero ( fig.[fig : anticont](c ) ) the distribution of the two remaining stokes parameters fig.[fig : anticont](b ) is only bi - modal ( and not 4-modal as in the anisotropic case ) with the two maxima at @xmath149 corresponding to circular polarization only .",
    "the positions of the maxima in both cases can be easily explained by considering the two integrals of motion ( [ stokes - integrals ] ) .",
    "as we have seen in both cases for most realizations one can neglect the value of @xmath133 and the pdf @xmath147 therefore remains confined to the circle of radius @xmath148 for all values of @xmath43 .",
    "next if one looks at the distribution of the second integral of motion in ( [ stokes - integrals ] ) , namely @xmath130 , then for the initial values @xmath139 uniformly distributed on a circle of radius 2 one can see that the distribution of @xmath130 is bimodal with the two maxima at @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) in the anisotropic case and @xmath154 in the isotropic case .",
    "the intersection points of the pair of curves @xmath155 with the circle in the @xmath156 plane are exactly the four observed maxima in the anisotropic case and two in the isotropic one .    in the case",
    "when initially the symmetry between the field components is broken ( bottom row in fig.[fig : anticont ] ) the situation is much more complex owing to the multimodal features of the distribution of the parameter @xmath133 - see fig.[fig : anticont](f ) .",
    "each maximum of the @xmath142 gives rise to at least 2 maxima in the distribution @xmath141 producing complex crown - like shapes shown in fig.[fig : anticont](d),(e ) .",
    "each of the maxima now corresponds to a certain elliptically polarized state which varies from waveguide to waveguide .",
    "note also that the positions of the maxima remain fixed with the propagation distance @xmath43 while their widths experience weak periodic oscillations ( not shown ) .",
    "the full theoretical analysis of these multimodal distributions requires further study which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have seen above that in the anticontinuum limit when the birefringence and the linear waveguide coupling can be neglected completely the system is integrable and instead of reaching thermal equilibrium it experiences periodic oscillations that can be averaged directly over the initial conditions to produce multimodal distribution for the established state of polarization .",
    "the question then arises as to what will happen if both the birefringence and the coupling are taken into account .",
    "one can expect that at the initial stages of evolution when the distance is less than the thermal length , @xmath44 , the evolution of the system is close to anticontinuum limit and the state of polarization follows the statistics derived above for the anticontinuum limit . for @xmath157",
    "however , the nonintegrability of the system becomes essential .",
    "the linear coupling between the waveguides leads to energy and power exchange between the waveguides so that eventually most of the initial peaks in the marginal pdf @xmath141 are destroyed and final thermal distribution sets in .",
    "this final distribution is characterized by the gibbs statistics ( [ gibbs ] ) with the partition function given by ( [ z - vector ] ) .",
    "we wish to calculate the partition function and the probability distributions in this final state still assuming strong nonlinearity @xmath78 but now taking into account the linear coupling and birefringence as well .",
    "let us first assume that the initial conditions are such that the system thermalizes into a state with finite temperature , i.e. @xmath158 as @xmath159 .",
    "we will shortly see that this is only possible for a very special choice of the initial conditions .",
    "then the dominating part of the exponent in ( [ z - vector ] ) is the nonlinear interaction term @xmath160 .",
    "other terms ( including the phase - dependent coupling energy ) are relatively slow functions of the amplitudes and do not therefore contribute to the field intensity pdf and the partition function .",
    "however it is important to retain the chemical potential term since as we shall see below @xmath161 always . when calculating the partition function ( [ z - vector ] ) one can resort to the saddle point approximation in @xmath162 which implies that at large values of @xmath77 the main contribution to the integral comes from absolute minimum of @xmath163 .",
    "this minimum is achieved for the values @xmath164 in other words the absolute minimum of the interaction hamiltonian subject to given total power is achieved by a circularly polarized state - the most symmetric of all .",
    "this minimum is also degenerate - for a system of @xmath165 waveguides there are @xmath166 possible choices of polarization orientation .",
    "this degeneracy is drastically reduced however if one takes into account the coupling term @xmath167 .",
    "this term favors the configuration where the phase difference @xmath168 is uniform across the waveguides which leaves only two possibilities : either all fields are clockwise polarized or they are all anticlockwise polarized .",
    "these states also corresponds to the two maxima of the distribution function @xmath169 ( or @xmath170 in stokes parameters ) one for each direction of rotation .",
    "as previously we assume here that @xmath171 which ensures the convergence of the integrals for positive temperature .",
    "the minimal value of the interaction energy ( at fixed power ) is given by @xmath172 if we assume uniform initial amplitudes @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( @xmath114 ) and neglect the terms that are not proportional to @xmath77 in the limit @xmath78 the average energy per waveguide is given by : @xmath173 .",
    "\\label{def - f}\\ ] ] the energy is always bound from below by @xmath174 . in the spirit of saddle point approximation",
    "we can now plug @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 from eq.([min - thermal ] ) into linear coupling pre - factor @xmath178 when calculating the partition function .",
    "the integration over the phases @xmath179 of the te component is reduced then to calculation of the partition function of the 1d calssical xy model ( see @xcite or @xcite for details ) . in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath180 ) the contribution of this linear coupling term to the logarithm of the partition function is @xmath181 . the remaining gaussian integration over the fluctuations around the minimum of @xmath182 eq.([min - thermal ] )",
    "is trivial . inserting the resulting expression for the partition function @xmath42 into the system of equations ( [ h - p ] ) after some simple algebra we obtain the following transcendental equation for the inverse temperature @xmath40 : @xmath183 with @xmath50 given by eq.([def - f ] ) . for the consistency of our approximation",
    "we must demand that the inverse temperature @xmath40 remains finite as @xmath77 goes to infinity ( as is the case in the scalar dnlse @xcite ) .",

    "we have found very little qualitative difference between the anisotropic and isotropic cases so figs.[fig : universal](c)-(f ) feature only the former . in [ fig : universal](c ) we can see that the intensity pdf becomes more and more narrowly centred around the average value of 2 and the distribution is close to gaussian with the variance proportional to @xmath196 . as for the pdf for the te phase difference , @xmath197 , the theoretical prediction @xmath198 is clearly corroborated by the numerics shown in [ fig : universal](d ) : one can observe a perfect data collapse for different values of @xmath77 .",
    "similar to universal correlations in the scalar case , one can obtain universal filed correlations in the vector case . in [ fig : universal](e ) we plot the field correlation functions functions defined as @xmath199 \\rangle $ ] where @xmath200 , @xmath201 denote different components of the field , te or tm , and the average is taken both over the waveguide position , @xmath62 , and the initial conditions .",
    "since in the thermal equilibrium the te and tm components are always @xmath190 out of phase the cross - field correlation @xmath202 is always zero while the self - field correlation functions have identical universal shape : @xmath203 this is illustrated in fig.[fig : universal]e , where all three components are plotted together with the theoretical fit . finally , fig.[fig : universal](f ) illustrates how quickly the final thermal distribution is achieved .",
    "the initial delta - peak in intensity distribution quickly broadens and settles to a stationary , almost gaussian distribution of the type shown in [ fig : universal](c ) already at the point @xmath204 ( in units of the coupling length ) that naturally serves as the thermalization length @xmath44 .",
    "one can see that thermalization here occurs over just a fraction of the coupling length , i.e. on the scale of @xmath205 mm for a typical algaas waveguide system . of course one can come up with a more rigorous quantitative definitions of @xmath44 , by looking e.g. at the saturation of the temperature defined from the simulated data via equipartition theorem @xcite but for the purposes of this paper",
    "we can restrict ourselves to the crude estimate above .",
    "all other distributions also stabilize at the same length .",
    "as for the value of the universal temperature constant , @xmath40 , one might think that it can be obtained from eq.([beta - saddle ] ) by putting the l.h.s . to zero .",
    "unfortunately this is not so since the resulting value of @xmath40 differs from the one observed in the numerics ( @xmath206 ) by the factor of almost 2 .",
    "the reason for such a discrepancy is that the vanishing l.h.s . of eq.([beta - saddle ] ) generally represents the main terms of approximation ( @xmath207 ) . as these terms have now cancelled each other the universal temperature @xmath208 is given by the balance of the next terms in the expansion that are of the order of unity .",
    "but it turns out that the neglected terms in the saddle point approximation of the partition function being of the order @xmath209 have nevertheless the contribution to its logarithmic derivative that are in the order of 1 , which affects the value of the reciprocal temperature @xmath40 .",
    "therefore in principle one has to consider the next terms in the saddle point approximation of ( [ z - vector ] ) .",
    "however we have opted for a different approach , namely , we have evaluated the logarithmic derivatives of the integral of @xmath210 numerically and the obtained solution of system ( [ h - p ] ) provided us a value of @xmath40 which fitted well the dependencies shown [ fig : universal](d)-(e ) ( and also the intensity pdfs in [ fig : universal](c ) ) . from a few separate runs ( not shown ) it appears also that not only the found universal value @xmath206 is independent of @xmath77 ( when @xmath78 ) but it is apparently independent of the material parameters @xmath143 as well .",
    "this fact however requires further thorough verification .      in the above section",
    "we have shown that if one ensures that the initial field components are locked in the same circular state of polarization for each waveguide , the reciprocal temperature is a universal numerical constant @xmath40 , independent on the nonlinearity parameter @xmath77 which implied universal shape of the intensity and phase pdfs as well as the field correlation functions .",
    "let us now turn to the more general case when the initial field does not have any preferred state of polarization , i.e. although both te and tm components have constant intensities @xmath135 , @xmath136 ( @xmath114 ) their phases are always independent and uniformly distributed .",
    "it turns out that although the final thermal state is still given by the constrained minimum of the nonlinear energy corresponding to the circular polarization given by ( [ min - thermal ] ) , the value of the temperature @xmath40 is no longer a universal constant but depends on the nonlinearity .",
    "also there is a drastic increase in the thermalization length , sometimes by up to 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "however we shall see below that in this general case the `` universality '' is not lost altogether .",
    "rather it is the product @xmath211 and not the temperature itself that is universal so instead of e.g. universal filed correlations as in the scalar case @xcite one has _",
    "universal intensity distribution _",
    "@xmath212 that is not affected by the value of the nonlinearity parameter @xmath77 .",
    "the width of this distribution ( i.e. the variance of the intensity fluctuations ) is of the order of @xmath213 .",
    "it turns out , however , that this new constant @xmath211 is less `` universal '' than the temperature in the above - considered case of initial circular polarization inasmuch as it exhibits strong dependence on parameters @xmath143 .",
    "we start by noticing that from eq.([beta - saddle ] ) it follows that if the initial fields are not circularly polarised , i.e. @xmath214 the reciprocal temperature @xmath40 must necessarily be of the order @xmath215 to balance the large terms in the l.h.s . of course",
    "( [ beta - saddle ] ) was obtained in the saddle point approximation which strictly speaking no longer applies when the product @xmath211 is in the order of unity .",
    "but as we shall presently see the relation @xmath216 also follows from the exact scaling dependence of the partition function valid beyond the saddle point approximation .",
    "we will introduce the new notations for the re - scaled temperature @xmath217 , and chemical potential @xmath218 that are now both in the order of 1 .",
    "one can notice that in this regime since @xmath40 scales as @xmath219 one can neglect the coupling energy , @xmath99 ( as well as the birefringence term @xmath220 ) in ( [ z - vector ] ) which simplifies the calculations somewhat .",
    "in fact this assumption is similar to the one used in section [ sec : boundaries ] when we determined the infinite temperature boundary @xmath55 with the only difference being that now one can not expand @xmath221 in powers of the argument ( since the latter is in the order of unity ) .",
    "regardless of the applicability of the saddle point approximation the numerical simulations demonstrate that a single waveguide probability density function factorises into the product of the pdf of the phase differences in the te polarization , @xmath222 and the pdf for the remaining three jones parameters , @xmath223 , with : @xmath224 note that since @xmath225 while @xmath226 the phase pdf @xmath222 is i ) non - universal ( i.e depends on the nonlinearity ) and ii ) approaches the uniform distribution as @xmath159 ( unlike the scalar case where it remains fixed , c.f .",

    "we have found that unlike in the case of universal correlations observed in section [ sec : universal ] ( or the scalar case ) , the thermalization length now depends on the temperature ( which is directly proportional to the nonlinearity ) . generally , the higher is the temperature , the longer it takes for the system to reach equilibrium . for the highest level on nonlinearity achieved in our simulations ( @xmath253 )",
    "the thermalization length was of the order @xmath254 units of coupling length .",
    "this is of course an extreme limit and lower values of nonlinearity ( i.e. temperature ) produce lower values of the thermalization length ( typically @xmath255 ) . in [ fig :",
    "general](a)-(d ) we can see marginal distribution of the 2 stokes parameters @xmath147 for @xmath192 .",

    "one can observe a good agreement between theory and numerics @xcite .",
    "the distribution is bimodal but the peaks ( corresponding to circular clockwise and anticlockwise polarisation ) are wide enough ( the width is in the order of @xmath227 ) . [",
    "fig : general](e),(f ) compare theoretical prediction given by ( [ pdf - s0 ] ) with the numerics .",
    "one can see that for different values of the nonlinearity @xmath77 the product @xmath256 ( and hence the intensity pdf @xmath212 ) indeed remains the same and instead of universal correlation functions observed in the scalar case or the case of circular initial polarization ( fig.[fig : universal](c ) ) one now has _ universal intensity distribution _ as given by ( [ pdf - s0 ] ) .",
    "the opposite case occurs with regards to the angle distribution @xmath197 , [ fig : general](g ) , ( h ) . whereas in the the scalar case and in the case of circular polarization ( fig.[fig : universal](d ) ) this pdf remains invariant , now , according to the theoretical prediction ( [ saddle - pdfs ] ) the distribution becomes closer and closer to uniform as @xmath77 increases since @xmath248 scales as @xmath77 while @xmath237 and @xmath238 remain constant . in some respect",
    "the results of ( [ fig : general])(e)-(h ) mirror those results for the circular polarization [ fig : universal](c),(d ) and the scalar case ( fig.2 of ref.@xcite ) but with the angular and intensity distribution trading places .",
    "the universal nature of the intensity pdf @xmath212 can also be explained from the energy conservation ( a similar argument for the scalar case was put forward in @xcite ) . in the limit of large @xmath77",
    "most of the energy concentrates in the nonlinear part @xmath160 which is a sum of on - site component given by ( [ hamiltonian - gamma ] ) .",
    "we can introduce the standard deviation for intensities as @xmath257 ( where angular brackets denote both averaging over the initial conditions and over waveguides ) and rewrite the nonlinear energy in terms of @xmath258 .",
    "then the following average integral of motion exists : @xmath259=const,\\ ] ] where the term @xmath260 $ ] collectively denotes the contribution from the linear coupling and birefringence .",
    "the value of the constant is determined by the initial conditions and since initially all waveguides have the amplitudes , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath114 , and random uncorrelated phases the initial variance vanishes @xmath261 and one has the following relation : @xmath262.\\ ] ] this means that beyond the thermalization distance @xmath44 the first term in the r.h.s . becomes a stationary @xmath77-independent constant of the order of unity and so does the variance of the intensity distribution as clearly seen in [ fig : general](e ) .",
    "the situation changes however if one starts from the locked circular polarization state for each waveguide as in section [ sec : universal ] .",
    "then the first term in the r.h.s . of the above changes to @xmath263 .",
    "but the distribution in this case centres narrowly on the extremal values @xmath264 , @xmath265 so that the average vanishes and in this regime the variance scales inversely proportional to @xmath77 as is indeed seen in [ fig : universal](c ) .",
    "finally it is instructive to see how the distribution of the polarization state @xmath141 evolves with distance @xmath43 , passing from the initial isotropic state through the integrable regime described in section [ sec : anticont ] and eventually relaxing towards the equilibrium gibbs distribution .",
    "the successive snapshots of such evolution are given in fig.[fig : evolution ] for the anisotropic case and @xmath192 .",
    "one can see all successive stages from the uniform distribution on a circle of radius 2 onto the 4-modal distribution that occurs in a transient anticontinuum regime when the energy exchange between the waveguides is still negligible ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : anticont](a ) ) and finally towards the thermal equilibrium state which is achieved when the weak linear inter - waveguide coupling provides uniform mixing between all the degrees of freedom .",
    "in this paper we have considered the structure of a thermalized field dynamics in discrete birefringent waveguide systems .",
    "we have defined for the first time an exact boundary in the space of the integrals of motion separating the thermal phase with positive temperature from that corresponding to localized excitations ( discrete breathers ) .",
    "we have shown that in the limit of high nonlinearity depending on the choice of the initial conditions the marginal pdf for the stokes parameters @xmath141 relaxes either to a universal , broad , bimodal distribution ( with the maxima corresponding to clock- or anti - clockwise circular polarization ) or ( if initially all waveguides are locked in the same circular polarization ) a narrow - peaked one , corresponding to the thermal fluctuation around the initial state . in both cases either the effective `` temperature constant '' @xmath40 is universal ( i.e. does not depend on the nonlinearity parameter @xmath77 ) or generally the product @xmath211 remains fixed as one increases the value of the nonlinearity .    also in the limit of strong nonlinearity before reaching the final thermal state the system passes through the state where its dynamic is integrable , corresponding to the anticontinuum limit of the nonlinear polarization dynamics . in this regime",
    "the probability distribution of finding a system in a certain polarization state has a complex multimodal structure .",
    "as the thermalization sets in the different modes of the distribution gradually disappear leaving only the two maxima corresponding to the circularly polarized states achieving the global minima of the nonlinear coupling energy subject to fixed total power .    as a possible continuation of",
    "this research one may suggest a more detailed study of the material dependence of the final thermal state ( here only two specific examples were considered ) as well as a full thermodynamical analysis of the breather region of the phase space as done by rumpf @xcite for the scalar case .",
    "the author would like to thank yaron silberberg and omer sidis for illuminating discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the marie curie fellowship project  `` indigo '' .",
    "in this section we recall the exact results for the dynamics of the system of stokes parameters ( [ stokes - dyn ] ) ( see @xcite ) . by differentiating the first eq . in ( [ stokes - dyn ] ) and using the other two we arrive at the following system : @xmath266 with @xmath267 \\\\ \\beta&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\gamma^2\\,(2-\\lambda_1)(2 - 3\\lambda_1 ) , \\quad \\omega=2\\gamma(1-\\lambda_1)\\,s_3(0)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] subject to initial conditions @xmath268 , and @xmath269 . the coefficient @xmath40 should not be confused with the reciprocal temperature as defined in other sections .",
    "thus in the isotropic case we get an equation for a harmonic oscillator while in the anisotropic case the equation is that of the nonlinear duffing oscillator .",
    "the solution in the isotropic case is simple : @xmath270 in the anisotropic case the form of the solution depends on the sign of the coefficient @xmath40 as well as the duffing oscillator energy : @xmath271 here we will only consider the case when @xmath272 so that we have simultaneously @xmath56 , @xmath273 and @xmath274 . for algaas we have @xmath275 which corresponds exactly to this regime . moreover in this case the potential energy has 2 symmetric maxima with the values @xmath276 and one can prove that for any choice of the initial conditions @xmath277 the difference @xmath278 the effective `` particle '' oscillates in the valley between the two maxima .",
