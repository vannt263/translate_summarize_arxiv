    "this extension is consistent with the scuba/@xmath39 m detection by @xcite .",
    "this clump comprises of four sources seen individually at @xmath37 m and @xmath29 m , the brightest two of which have been spectroscopically confirmed to lie at the same redshift and therefore be proto - cluster members @xcite ; hence , we can assume the long - wavelength flux density from these sources to have similar colours due to the rayleigh - jeans tail .",
    "we note the peak flux density at the longer wavelengths remains centered on the radio galaxy .",
    "we assume , for the purposes of sed fitting , that all this flux density comes from one source , but then treat the sfr measured from the starburst component as an upper limit to that from just the radio galaxy .",
    "all the data used in the fitting of this sample are presented in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "the goal of our sed fitting is to obtain the agn and starburst ir luminosities ( @xmath2 m ) and then derive physical quantities from these results .",
    "we fit the observed photometry across @xmath1 m rest frame with a two - component model consisting of an agn and a starburst template .",
    "extrapolation of the radio core flux density using the observed flux densities at wavelengths @xmath40 cm and the core spectral index from @xcite , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , suggests that synchrotron emission at these wavelengths is many orders of magnitude fainter .",
    "we use the decompir sed model fitting code @xcite to fit the two components with some minor adaptations to use additional band - pass filters .",
    "the agn component is an empirical model based on observations of moderate - luminosity ( i.e. , @xmath43ergs@xmath10 ) low - redshift agn in @xcite selected at high x - ray energies from the local , @xmath44 , _",
    "swift_-bat sample @xcite .",
    "this model is a continuous function comprised of two power - laws and a modified black - body , expressed as :    @xmath45    in comparison with other agn templates commonly used , it is broadly similar in the mid - ir regime ; however it has lower far - ir emission , when normalized at @xmath46 m , compared to ngc 1068 and mrk 231 , likely attributable to unaccounted starburst contributions at far - ir wavelengths in these two galaxies @xcite .",
    "this model is also broadly similar to empirical models presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the formulation above is that the various parameters ( the two power - law slopes and the black - body peak wavelength ) can be adjusted to closely match these other models which we test later on .",
    "the starburst models consist of five seds developed by mullaney et al . from @xcite designed to represent a typical range of sed types ( i.e. , peaking at a range of wavelengths ) . beyond @xmath47 m",
    "these templates are extrapolated using a grey body with a frequency dependent emissivity approximated as @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "in addition to the normalisation and choice of starburst template , decompir can apply extinction to each component separately . as the agn - dominated mid - ir spectrum @xcite shows a little silicate emission , not absorption",
    ", we only allow the starburst component to be affected by absorption(@xmath50)@xmath51@xmath52 @xcite , the mid - ir sed does not @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the bright h@xmath16 seen by @xcite and can be attributed to differences in dust grains seen toward the circumnuclear regions of agn and the diffuse ism of our galaxy . ]",
    "therefore the chi - squared , @xmath53 , minimisation performed by decompir has four free components : normalisation of each template , choice of starburst template and starburst extinction .",
    "the best fit combination of models returns a reduced chi - squared of @xmath54 with the starburst template , ` sb4 ' , the template peaking at the shortest wavelength .",
    "we note that while the best fit model has some extinction for the starburst component , it is poorly constrained and we get an equally good fit with no extinction and similar luminosities within @xmath55 .",
    "the fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ sed ] and the luminosities are reported in table  [ tab : res ] .",
    "the model fits the data well , although at the longest wavelengths the model slightly struggles to fit the sharp decrease in flux density from @xmath56 to @xmath30 m .",
    "the sed at these wavelengths is dominated by the rayleigh - jeans tail of the starburst component and any blackbody would struggle to fit such a flux density ratio , although the slope does depend on the emissivity index . the ` sb4 ' starburst template is the hottest of the five used , with a dust temperature of @xmath57k .",
    "the next two cooler templates , @xmath58k , give a @xmath59 and fit the @xmath60 m flux density better , but exceed the @xmath30 m flux density by @xmath61 .",
    "if we exclude the @xmath60 m data point we marginally improve the best fit to @xmath62 , again for the ` sb4 ' template and with the output parameters changing very little ( note the number of degrees of freedom drops by one ) .",
    "one potential method to better fit the observed high @xmath56 to @xmath30 m flux ratio is to use starburst seds with a steeper emissivity index . by modifying the templates so that @xmath63 we can obtain a steeper slope on the rayleigh - jeans side of the sed peak .",
    "repeating the sed fitting with these modified starburst templates we obtain a best fit of @xmath62 from the modified ` sb5 ' starburst template .",
    "the overall fit does not significantly change with a slightly smaller @xmath60 m excess , by @xmath7 , as well as an agn luminosity increase of @xmath64 and a starburst luminosity decrease of @xmath7 .",
    "hence , there is no significant improvement with this change to the starburst templates",
    ".    visual examination of the images at 350 , 500 and @xmath30 m , see fig .  [",
    "fig : postage ] , suggests the measured flux densities at these wavelengths may have contributions from other proto - cluster members as discussed in  [ data ] . as the galaxies responsible for this emission lie at the same redshift , and are",
    "almost certainly starbursts to be emitting at these wavelengths , they likely have similar flux density ratios .",
    "the @xmath38 m flux density is not affected by these nearby sources and the peak flux density still originates from the central radio galaxy .",
    "the ratio of the radio galaxy to companion peak flux densities at @xmath38 m is about @xmath65 ; hence , we estimate the contribution of the companion to the measured flux density at longer wavelengths to be @xmath66 at most .",
    "we note that the @xmath67 m flux density need only be decreased by @xmath68 to produce an unphysical flux density ratio for a cold dust sed . however , if we decrease the three longest wavelength flux densities by this much the best fit gives a starburst luminosity only @xmath69 lower .",
    "hence , although the estimated starburst ir luminosity is formally an upper limit for the radio galaxy , we postulate that the true starburst ir luminosity of the spiderweb galaxy is , at most , only @xmath69 lower .",
    "we do not have enough photometry at @xmath70m@xmath71 m to allow all the agn parameters ( the two power - law slopes and the black - body peak ) , other than the normalisation , to vary simultaneously . allowing just one parameter to vary results in changes of luminosities of @xmath72 .",
    "we can change the parameters in equation one to mimic the @xcite and @xcite agn models . in both cases , the agn luminosity halves and the starburst luminosity",
    "doubles , but the fit is worse with @xmath73 .",
    "we note that this fit is improved if we use the richards or netzer agn model with the @xmath63 starburst sed , with the same qualitative results , but with a @xmath74 .",
    "we also tried using the suite of empirical starburst templates from @xcite instead of the brandl templates .",
    "the best fit templates were also those peaking at the shortest wavelengths , i.e. , the ultra luminous ir galaxy ( ulirg ) templates , but with a slightly higher chi - squared : @xmath75 . to obtain a better understanding of the uncertainties we also randomly varied the flux densities with a gaussian distribution based on their quoted uncertainties one hundred times and repeated the fitting procedures .",
    "we found the variance of the resulting luminosities to be @xmath76 , i.e. , less than the quoted uncertainties in table  [ tab : res ] .",
    "we finish this section by noting that while there are many ways to tweak both the agn and starburst templates and change the parameters of the fit all solutions have an agn component dominating at the shortest wavelengths , @xmath77 m , and a starburst component dominating at long wavelengths @xmath78 m .",
    "hence , all good fits have a powerful , @xmath79(sb / agn)@xmath80 , starburst and agn component . until we get high spatial and/or spectral resolution data , e.g. from alma or jwst",
    ", it will be difficult to differentiate between many moderately good fits .",
    "we have measured very high agn and starburst luminosities which imply a high central black hole accretion rate and sfr , respectively .",
    "the total ir luminosity of this system causes it to be classed as a hyper - luminous ir galaxy , @xmath81 .",
    "we discuss here what these results mean and how they relate to the radio emission and overall evolutionary state of the system .",
    "we also discuss the potential origin of the @xmath60 m excess .",
    "the total ir agn luminosity marks the spiderweb galaxy as one of the most powerful agn known ; therefore the agn is likely having a strong effect on its host galaxy and immediate environment ( see  [ dis : env ] ) . assuming the full unobscured agn sed is similar to the @xcite templates , we get @xmath82(agn ) @xmath83(agn ) ( we note other unobscured agn templates produce similar numbers ) and therefore an agn bolometric luminosity of @xmath84 .",
    "this bolometric agn luminosity estimate is higher than previous estimates , e.g. , @xcite who used the observed x - ray luminosity @xcite and corrected it using the @xcite template , @xmath82(agn ) @xmath85(agn ) .",
    "this discrepancy is unlikely due to extinction as seen towards the nucleus in x - rays given the low absorbing column @xcite . as noted earlier , neither the mid - ir spectrum @xcite nor the sed ( drouart et al .",
    "2012 ) indicate significant extinction either .",
    "the discrepancy between the hard x - ray and ir - derived bolometric agn luminosities is more likely due to the dispersion between individual sources and the @xcite templates .",
    "this , in turn , could be explained by a different dust - to - gas ratio in this source , a clumpy torus or an unusual agn geometry , but further investigation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "this galaxy exhibits both a large scale central velocity distribution indicative of a powerful outflow @xcite and a high - luminosity mid - ir @xmath17 molecular emission line @xcite",
    ". the derived bolometric radiative power would therefore be enough to power both the outflow ( @xmath86  * ? ? ? * ) and the probably shock - heated gas ( @xmath87  * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even assuming a @xmath69 coupling efficiency",
    ". however , the kinetic power of the radio jet , estimated to be @xmath88 by @xcite , is also powerful enough to potentially drive the outflow .",
    "nesvadba et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also present an estimate of the black hole mass from the measurement of the central h@xmath16 luminosity and fwhm . the principle uncertainty in this measurement",
    "is how the orientation of the galaxy affects the application of the @xcite scaling relationship , which is based on a sample of lower luminosity agn likely to be more face - on than the spiderweb galaxy , i.e. , at lower inclinations .",
    "indeed , g. drouart et al .",
    "( 2012 , in preparation ) find a correlation between radio core prominence and viewing angle from a hot torus model fitted to the mid - ir sed of hzrgs which suggests that the radio axis is aligned to torus axis .",
    "these authors find that the spiderweb galaxy is inclined at angle of @xmath89 to the line of sight , but has modest extinction , an @xmath90 .",
    "while generally there may be misalignments of up to @xmath91 between the radio and torus axes , it is likely that the spiderweb galaxy is more edge - on than the @xcite sample .",
    "@xcite show that the measured fwhm from a thin accretion disk is proportional to the sine of the inclination angle squared .",
    "therefore , if the spiderweb galaxy has a higher inclination angle , @xmath92 , than the mean value for the agn sample used in @xcite , @xmath93 , then we would be overestimating the black hole mass by @xmath94 which @xcite assume to be @xmath95 .",
    "we therefore take the lower , inclination - corrected , value of the black hole mass from @xcite , @xmath96 .",
    "the higher bolometric luminosity derived above implies a higher black hole mass derived from the h@xmath16 luminosity .",
    "however , we also note the black hole mass reported here would put this galaxy on par with some of the most massive black holes known in the local universe @xcite , and are very rare for the @xmath13 universe .",
    "hence , we treat this black hole mass as uncertain by a factor @xmath97 .",
    "we then relate the bolometric luminosity to the maximally possible accretion luminosity where the continuum radiation force outwards balances the gravitational force inwards in hydrostatic equilibrium , i.e. , the eddington luminosity , and we find an eddington accretion rate of @xmath7 .",
    "this is a factor of a few higher than the estimate of @xcite due to the higher bolometric luminosity and lower black hole mass used in this work .",

    "this sfr is much higher than estimates from optical / near - ir data @xcite , likely due to obscuration by dust , but is broadly consistent with estimates from the pah luminosities measured from the mid - ir sed ( ogle et al . , 2012 ; j. rawlings , 2012 , in preparation ) .",

    "we caution that the statistical significance of this result is poor but the spiderweb galaxy remains a promising target for far - ir / millimetre spectroscopy .",
    "we have determined that the spiderweb galaxy is in a rare , short - lived , phase of extreme , concurrent black hole and host galaxy growth .",
    "if we compare the relative luminosities of the agn and starburst component to the ` continuous growth ' relation in @xcite , i.e. , the ratio required to maintain a constant black hole to stellar mass ratio , we see that the black hole is growing at a relatively faster rate by almost 1dex .",
    "this result is consistent with the observed , albeit rather uncertain , ratio of stellar to black hole mass , @xmath137 , i.e. the black hole is relatively more massive ( and has been growing rapidly ) than it would be for the spiderweb galaxy to lie on the local ` @xmath138 ' mass ratio of @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "the stellar and black hole masses do lie on the relationship found by @xcite and we note that both observed relations have a large scatter , @xmath140dex .",
    "if this source is to end up on the local ` @xmath138 ' relation , further build - up of stellar mass is required . however , we have estimated that the star formation rate will likely rapidly decrease on time - scales of @xmath141myr assuming no further source of fuel .",
    "@xcite have recently examined the _",
    "herschel_/@xmath38 m detection rate of x - ray luminous agn in the _ chandra _ deep field north in the @xmath142 redshift range as a function of x - ray luminosity .",
    "those authors found that the fraction of x - ray agn detected with @xmath143mjy decreases to zero above @xmath144ergs@xmath10 ( @xmath145 ) and interpreted this result as suppression of star formation by powerful outflows driven by the agn .",
    "the spiderweb is a clear counter - example of this result with an x - ray luminosity well above this limit _ and _ a bright @xmath38 m detection , @xmath146mjy .",
    "however , @xcite surveyed a small area , covering just @xmath147 , and hence only probed a small volume where galaxies as massive as the spiderweb are rare over this volume ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we can estimate an upper limit to the duty cycle of a simultaneous agn and starburst activity above these limits by dividing the look - back time probed across @xmath142 , @xmath148gyr , by the number of x - ray agn in this study , 21 , and obtain a value of @xmath149myr .",
    "if the spiderweb galaxy is in a transition from merger - induced starburst phase to an agn phase , and this transition is relatively short , @xmath150myr , as the analysis here suggests , then the @xcite results are consistent with our observations .",
    "we point out that such comparison is only valid if there are similar evolutionary processes going on in the less massive @xcite sample .",
    "the environment of the spiderweb galaxy has been extensively studied and a full review of work in this area is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have noted previously that this galaxy hosts one of the most powerful agn known : both from its bolometric luminosity ( indicative of radiative power ) and its radio luminosity ( indicative of kinetic power ) .",
    "@xcite compared massive galaxies in the environment of the spiderweb galaxy with identically selected field galaxies from the goods - s field .",
    "they determined that the galaxies in the proto - cluster environment had formed earlier and had lower sfrs , particularly close to the hzrg and along the east - west distribution of proto - cluster members .",
    "the radio emission has the same projected east - west axes ; hence , it is possible that the lower sfrs observed could be due to the influence of the agn jet .",
    "alternatively , they may simply be more heavily obscured .    as the spiderweb galaxy is situated in a well studied proto - cluster we can estimate its future growth .",
    "several authors have identified proto - cluster members and estimated that they would merge with , or be tidally stripped by , the radio galaxy before the present epoch .",
    "@xcite identified 18 proto - cluster members through _ hst _ imaging within 150kpc of the central radio galaxy , the combined mass of which they estimated to be @xmath151 .",
    "@xcite spectroscopically confirmed two red galaxies within @xmath152kpckpc previously reported .",
    "] , in addition to those mentioned above , with stellar masses of the order @xmath153 each .",
    "hence , the total stellar mass increase of the spiderweb galaxy over the upcoming @xmath154gyr would be @xmath155 , i.e. , at least a doubling in its mass , which would put it closer to the local ` @xmath138 ' relation .",
    "@xcite interpret their kinematic study of the environment , which showed a double peaked velocity distribution , as being due the merger of two massive clusters .",
    "if each cluster contained a dominant central galaxy then the high agn and starburst luminosities could well be due to a gas rich merger of two large galaxies .",
    "we have measured the total ir rest - frame sed of the spiderweb galaxy , for the first time , and fitted an agn and starburst model components .",
    "we find that the bolometric luminosity of the agn component of this source implies that the agn has an accretion rate high enough to power both the jets and the observed outflow .",
    "the spiderweb galaxy has a high sfr ; however , we estimate this sfr can not be maintained for long and can not be responsible for the outflow .",
    "we estimate the radio jets are @xmath127myr old . at the current sfr ,",
    "the host galaxy has only had enough time to accumulate @xmath156 of its observed stellar mass while the jets were on .",
    "hence , the jets were likely triggered after most of the current burst of star formation commenced .",
    "the central black hole is possibly growing at a relatively faster rate than the host galaxy ( assuming this system will end up on the local @xmath138 relation )",
    ". studies of the proto - cluster environment suggest that mergers of satellites , and hence increased star formation , will occur on timescales of hundreds of myr and ultimately the stellar mass will double by the present epoch .",
    "we also see very tentative evidence for strong [ cii]@xmath11 m emission .",
