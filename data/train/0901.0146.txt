    "grain alignment has a reputation of being a very tough astrophysical problem of a very long standing . indeed , for a long time since the discovery of dust - induced starlight extinction polarization in 1949 ( hall 1949 ; hiltner 1949 ) the mechanism of alignment was both enigmatic and illusive .",
    "works by great minds like lyman spitzer and edward purcell moved the field forward in terms of understanding of grain dynamics , but , nevertheless , left observations and theory poorly connected .",
    "an extended discussion of the history of the grain alignment subject can be found in the review by lazarian ( 2003 ) .",
    "below we briefly mention several milestones in our understanding of grain alignment .",
    "the first extended review of grain alignment theory is by purcell ( 1969 ) .",
    "however , the subject is so rapidly developing that even the most recent extended review by lazarian ( 2007 ) is outdated in a number of aspects .",
    "several mechanisms were proposed and elaborated to various degree ( see lazarian 2007 for a review ) , including the `` textbook solution '' , namely , the paramagnetic davis - greenstein ( 1951 ) mechanism , which matured through intensive work since its introduction ( e.g. jones & spitzer 1967 , purcell 1979 , spitzer & mcglynn 1979 , mathis 1986 , roberge et al . 1993 , lazarian 1997 , roberge & lazarian 1999 ) .",
    "the mechanical stochastic alignment was pioneered by gold ( 1951 ) , who concluded that supersonic flows should align grains rotating thermally",
    ". further advancement of the mechanical alignment mechanism ( e.g. lazarian 1994 , 1995a ) allowed one to extend the range of applicability of the mechanism , but left it as an auxiliary process , nevertheless .",
    "mechanical regular alignment of helical grains discussed in lazarian ( 1995b ) , lazarian , goodman , myers ( 1997 ) , lazarian & hoang ( 2007ab ) seems to be more promising as it can align grains within subsonic flows . in any case , currently the mechanism based on radiative torques looks as the most promising ( see andersson & potter 2007 , lazarian 2007 , whittet et al .",
    "thus we focus our present contribution on this mechanism .",
    "the effect of alignment induced by radiative torques was discovered by dolginov & mytrophanov ( 1976 ) .",
    "they considered a grain which exhibited a difference in the cross - section for right - handed and left - handed photons .",
    "they noticed that scattering of unpolarized light by such a grain resulted in its spin - up .",
    "however , they could not quantify the effect and therefore their pioneering work was mostly neglected for the next 20 years .",
    "the explosion of interest to the radiative torques we owe to bruce draine , who realized that the torques can be treated with the modified version of the discrete dipole approximation code , namely , ddscat , by draine & flatau ( 1994 ) .",
    "empirical studies in draine ( 1996 ) , draine & weingartner ( 1996 , 1997 ) , weingartner & draine ( 2003 ) demonstrated that the magnitude of torques is substantial for irregular shapes studied .",
    "after that it became impossible to ignore the radiative torque alignment .",
    "later , the spin - up of grains by radiative torques was demonstrated in laboratory conditions ( abbas et al .",
    ".    it should be stressed , however , that the reliable predictions for the alignment degree can not be obtained with the `` brute force approach '' .",
    "indeed , radiative torques depend on many parameters , e.g. grain shape , grain size , radiation wavelength , grain composition , the angle between the radiation direction and the magnetic field .",
    "it is not practical to do numerical calculations for this vast multidimensional parameter space .",
    "therefore the important empirical studies above had limited predictive powers and were used to demonstrated the radiative torque effects sometimes using one grain shape , one grain size , one wavelength of light , and one direction of the light beam with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "the quantitative stage of radiative torque studies required theoretical models describing radiative torques . in lazarian & hoang ( 2007a ) we proposed a simple model of radiative torques which allowed a good analytical description of the radiative torque alignment .",
    "this model was elaborated and extended in lazarian & hoang ( 2008 ) and hoang & lazarian ( 2008abc ) .",
    "further on , we shall abbreviate radiative torques to rats .",
    "lazarian & hoang ( 2007a , henceforth lh07 ) showed that a simple model in fig .",
    "[ amo ] reproduces well the essential basic properties of rats .",
    "the model consists of an ellipsoidal grain with a mirror attached to its side .",
    "lh07 termed the model amo , which is an abbreviation from analytical model .",
    "note , that grains can be both `` left - handed '' and `` right - handed '' . for our grain model to become `` right handed '' the mirror should be turned by 90 degrees . our studies with ddscat confirmed that actual irregular grains also vary in handedness .",

    "the third component @xmath8 happens to induce grain precession only , which for most situations is subdominant to the larmor precession of the grain in the interstellar magnetic field ( see more discussion in lh07 ) .",

    "in fact , lh07 showed that the radiative torque alignment can be fully determined if the ratio @xmath18 is known . in terms of practical calculations ,",
    "this enormously simplifies the calculations of radiative torques : instead of calculating two _ functions _ @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12 it is enough to calculate just two _ values _",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "according to lh07 the maximal value of the function @xmath11 is achieved for @xmath21 of the function @xmath12 is achieved at @xmath22 . in other words , one can use a _ single number _",
    "@xmath23 instead of _ two functions _ to characterize grain alignment .",
    "thus , it is possible to claim that the @xmath24-ratio is as important for the alignment as the grain axis ratio for producing polarized radiation by aligned grains .",
    "studying the rat alignment lh07 corrected the treatment of grain dynamics in draine & weingartner ( 1997 ) . as a result , instead of cyclic trajectories in the latter paper",
    ", they obtained a situation when , instead of accelerating grains , rats were slowing grains down .",
    "this slowing down in realistic circumstances , e.g. in the presence of thermal fluctuations ( see hoang & lazarian 2008a ) did not bring grains to a complete stop , but resulted in creating of low-@xmath16 attractor point , in agreement with an earlier empirical study in weingartner & draine ( 2003 ) .",
    "thus , apart from high attractor points , lh07 found that for a range of @xmath24 and the angle @xmath17 between the radiation beam and magnetic field direction only low-@xmath16 attractor points exist . a later study by hoang & lazarian ( 2008a ) established that when low-@xmath16 and high-@xmath16 attractor points coexist , the high-@xmath16 points are more stable and therefore external stochastic driving , e.g. arising from gaseous bombardment , brings grains to high-@xmath16 attractor points .",
    "this transfer can take several damping times , but for the steady state interstellar alignment in the situation when a high-@xmath16 attractor point exists , one can safely assume that grains are aligned with high-@xmath16 .",
    "when does the alignment happens at low-@xmath16 ?",
    "figure  [ chi]b shows predictions for the existence of low-@xmath16 and high-@xmath16 attractor points for the analytical model ( amo ) for the parameter space given by @xmath24 and the angle @xmath17 .",
    "individual horizontal lines correspond to particular grain shapes with a given @xmath24 . for the interstellar radiation field ( isrf )",
    "the calculations of @xmath24 are performed using torques averaged over the interstellar spectrum of wavelengths ( see lh07 for more details ) .",
    "we see that the correspondence in terms of predicting the distribution of high-@xmath16 and low-@xmath16 attractor points is also good , which , however , is not surprising due to the good correspondence between the functional dependences obtained for the amo and irregular grains depicted in figure  [ amo]a .",

    "observations testify that interstellar grains tend to get aligned with long axes perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field , the fact that was frequently used to argue that the davis - greenstein ( 1951 ) mechanism is responsible for the alignment . can radiative torques explain this observational fact ?     parallel ( or anti -",
    "parallel ) to @xmath26 correspond to the stationary points as at these positions the component of torques that changes the alignment angle vanishes .",

    "[ alignment ] illustrates why radiative torques tend to align grains the `` right way '' , i.e. in agreement with observations .",
    "interstellar grains experience internal relaxation that tends to make them rotate about their axis of maximal moment of inertia .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to follow the dynamics of angular momentum to determine grain axes alignment . let us call the component of torque parallel to @xmath27 the _ spin - up torque _ @xmath29 and perpendicular to @xmath27 the _ alignment torque _ @xmath30 .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath27 is precessing about magnetic field due to the magnetic moment of a grain ( see dolginov & mytrophanov 1976 ) .",
    "the alignment torques @xmath30 are perpendicular to @xmath27 and therefore as @xmath27 gets parallel to @xmath26 the fast precession of the grain makes the torques averaged over @xmath27 precession vanish as @xmath31 .",
    "thus the positions corresponding to @xmath27 aligned with @xmath26 are stationary points , irrespectively of the functional forms of radiative torques , i.e. of components @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in other words , grain can stay aligned with @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "the arguments above are quite general , but they do not address the question whether there are other stationary points , e.g. whether the alignment can also happen with @xmath27 perpendicular to @xmath26 . to answer this question one should use the actual expressions for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the analysis in lazarian & hoang ( 2007a ) shows that there is , indeed , a range of angles between the direction of radiation and the magnetic field for which grains tend to aligned in a `` wrong '' way , i.e. with long axes parallel to magnetic field .",
    "however , this range of angles is rather narrow and does not exceed several degrees .",
    "moreover , the `` wrong '' alignment corresponds to the positions for which the spin - up torques @xmath29 are negative , which induces grain alignment with low angular momentum at some fraction of the thermal value .",
    "the corresponding discussion is presented in lazarian & hoang ( 2007a ) and hoang & lazarian ( 2008a ) . ] .",
    "grain thermal wobbling at low-@xmath16 attractor point ( lazarian 1994 , lazarian & roberge 1997 ) induces the variations in the angle that is typically exceeds this range .",
    "thus a remarkable fact emerges : grains get always aligned with long axes perpendicular to @xmath26 !",
    "grain dynamics is rather complex and it should be accounted for if measures of alignment are sought .      to produce the observed starlight polarization , grains must be aligned , with their _ long axes _",
    "perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the degree of alignment involves alignment not only of the grain s angular momenta @xmath27 with respect to the external magnetic field @xmath26 , but also the alignment of the grain s long axes with respect to @xmath27.the latter alignment is frequently termed the `` internal alignment '' .    purcell ( 1979 , henceforth p79 ) was the first to consider internal relaxation as the course of internal alignment .",
    "he showed that the rates of internal relaxation of energy in wobbling grains are much faster than the time of grain alignment .",
    "this induced many researchers to think that all grains rotate about the axis of their maximal inertia moment and the internal alignment is always perfect .",
    "lazarian ( 1994 ) corrected this conclusion by showing that the fluctuations associated with the internal dissipation should induce the wobbling , which amplitude increases as the effective rotational temperature of grains approaches that of grain material .",
    "the rate of internal relaxation is an important characteristic of grain dynamics .",
    "spitzer & mcglynn ( 1979 ) , lazarian & draine ( 1997 , 1999ab ) , lazarian & hoang ( 2008 ) , hoang & lazarian ( 2008b ) demonstrated its crucial significance for various aspects of grain alignment .",
    "p79 was the first to evaluate the rates of internal relaxation , taking into account the inelastic effects and a particular effect that he discovered himself , the barnett relaxation . as we know , the barnett effect is the magnetization of a paramagnetic body as the result of its rotation .",
    "purcell ( 1979 ) noticed that the wobbling rotating body would experience changes of the magnetization arising from the changes of the direction of rotation in grain axes .",
    "this would entail fast relaxation , with a characteristic time about a year for a @xmath34  cm grains .",
    "lazarian & draine ( 1999a ) identified @xmath35 times stronger relaxation related to nuclear spins and lazarian & hoang ( 2008 ) showed that superparamagnetic grains , e.g. grains with magnetic inclusions ( see jones & spitzer 1967 , mathis 1986 , martin 1994 ) , exhibit enhanced internal relaxation .",

    "p79 identified three separate systematic torque mechanisms : inelastic scattering of impinging atoms when gas and grain temperatures differ , photoelectric emission , and h@xmath36 formation on grain surfaces ( see fig .  [ relax]b ) .",
    "below we shall refer to the latter as `` purcell s torques '' .",
    "these were shown to dominate the other two for typical conditions in the diffuse ism ( p79 ) .",
    "the existence of systematic h@xmath36 torques is expected due to the random distribution over the grain surface of catalytic sites of h@xmath36 formation , since each active site acts as a minute thruster emitting newly - formed h@xmath36 molecules .",
    "a later study of uncompensated torques in hoang & lazarian ( 2008b ) added additional systematic torques to the list , namely , torques arising from plasma - grain interactions and torques arising from emission of radiation by an irregular grains .",
    "radiative torques arising from the interaction of the _ isotropic _ radiation with an irregular grain ( draine & weingartner 1996 ) also represent the systematic torques fixed in the grain body .",
    "we shall call all the systematic torques above _ pinwheel torques _ to distinguish them from rats , which are systematic torques arising from anisotropic flow of photons or atoms interacting with an helical grain ( see below ) .",
    "p79 considered changes of the grain surface properties and noted that those should stochastically change the direction ( in body - coordinates ) of the systematic torques .",
    "spitzer & mcglynn ( 1979 ) developed a theory of such _",
    "crossovers_. during a crossover , the grain slows down , flips , and thereafter is accelerated again ( see fig .",
    "[ range]a ) .    from the viewpoint of the grain - alignment theory ,",
    "the important question is whether or not a grain gets randomized during a crossover .",
    "if the value of the angular momentum is small during the crossover , the grains are susceptible to randomization arising from atomic bombardment .",
    "the original calculations in spitzer & mcglynn ( 1979 ) obtained only marginal correlation between the values of the angular momentum before and after a crossover , but their analysis disregarded thermal fluctuations within the grain with temperature @xmath37 . according to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem these thermal fluctuation",
    "induce thermal wobbling with the frequency determined by the internal relaxation rate ( see lazarian 1994 ) .",
    "if the crossover happens over time shorter than the grain internal relaxation time , lazarian & draine ( 1997 ) showed that the spitzer & mcglynn ( 1979 ) theory of crossovers should be modified to include the value of thermal angular momentum @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the maximal moment of inertial of an oblate grain .",

    "[ superparamagnetic ] shows that for superparamagnetic grains subject to a diffuse interstellar radiation field most grains still get to the low attractor point , which reflects the fact that it is the radiative torques rather than paramagnetic ones that dominate the alignment .",
    "as the high-@xmath16 attractor point is more stable compared to the low-@xmath16 attractor point superparamagnetic grains get transfered by gaseous collisions from the low-@xmath16 to high-@xmath16 attractor points .",
    "thus , superparamagnetic grains always rotate at high rate in the presence of radiative torques .",
    "one concludes that , rather unexpectedly , intensive paramagnetic relaxation changes the rotational state of the grains , enabling them to rotate _ rapidly_. the alignment of grains at high-@xmath16 point is _ perfect_.",
    "pinwheel torques were considered by purcell ( 1979 ) in the context of paramagnetic alignment . how do these torques also affect the radiative torque alignment ?",
    "hoang & lazarian ( 2008b ) showed that the sufficiently strong pinwheel torques can create new high-@xmath16 attractor points .",
    "therefore for sufficiently strong pinwheel torques , e.g. for torques arising from h@xmath36 formation , one may observe the correlation of higher degree of polarization with the atomic hydrogen content in the media , provided that h@xmath36 torques as strong as they considered in purcell ( 1979 ) and the subsequent papers ( see spitzer & mcglynn 1979 , lazarian 1995 , lazarian & draine 1997 ) . another implicit assumption for observing this correlation is that the grains are not superparamagnetic . for superparamagnetic grains the alignment , as we discussed above , is perfect anyhow .",
    "the existing uncertainty is related to the magnitude of the pinwheel torques .",
    "if the correlation is observed , this would mean that , first of all , grains are not superparamagnetic and , in addition , the pinwheel torques are sufficiently strong to overwhelm the radiative torques which drive the grains to low attractor points ( see figure  [ superparamagnetic]b ) .      our discussion in section  [ w1 ]",
    "indicates that for sufficiently large grains the internal relaxation over the time - scale of rat alignment is negligible .",
    "large grains , however , are present e.g. in accretion disks and comets .",
    "the polarization from accretion disks can provide one with an important insight into magnetic of the objects ( see cho & lazarian 2007 ) , while understanding of the alignment for comet dust is important for explaining circular polarization observed ( see below ) .",
    "thus , proper description of rat alignment in the absence of internal relaxation is important .    in the absence of internal relaxation",
    "can get aligned not only with long axes perpendicular to the angular momentum @xmath27 , but also with the longest axis parallel to @xmath27 , i.e. the axis of minimal moment of grain inertia parallel to @xmath27 .",
    "this complicates the analysis compared to the case of interstellar grains , for which the internal relaxation is very fast .",
    "the corresponding problem was addressed in hoang & lazarian ( 2008c , henceforth hl08c ) .",
    "the results of the latter study are summarized in table  1 .",

    "this is consistent with the finding there that such alignment happens for the high-@xmath16 attractor points of amo .",
    "if this is the case , when the low-@xmath16 and high-@xmath16 attractor points coexist the steady - state alignment will happen only with high-@xmath16 attractor point ( see discussion in  [ magnetic ] ) .",
    "the wrong alignment happens only with low-@xmath16 attractor points and it is suggestive that in the presence of gaseous bombardment the grains may still spend more time in the vicinity of the high-@xmath16 repellor point , as was shown in numerical simulations by hoang & lazarian ( 2008a ) .",
    "the conclusions obtained with amo are consistent with a limited parameter study obtained in hl08c for an irregular grain .",
    "however , it is clear that more extensive studies of the rat alignment in the absence of internal relaxation are required .",
    "aligned grains provide the best way to trace magnetic fields in molecular clouds and getting insight into the role of magnetic field in star formation ( see hildebrand et al .",
    "2000 ) . in dense molecular clouds one might expect all grain alignment mechanisms to be suppressed as conditions there approach those of thermal equilibrium ( see discussion in lazarian et al .",
    "this conclusion , however , contradicts to observations in ward - thompson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which revealed aligned grains dense in pre - stellar cores with high ( up to @xmath55 ) optical depth .",
    "cho & lazarian ( 2005 ) noticed that the efficiency of grain alignment is a function of the grain size ( see figure  [ wavelength]b ) , and this enables even highly attenuated reddened interstellar light to aligne large grains that are known to exist in dark cores .",
    "more detailed calculations in bethell et al .",
    "2007 supported this explanation .",
    "however , even the latter paper which considered the inhomogeneity of density distribution for the purposes of the radiation transfer , used only crude estimates of grain alignment efficiencies .",
    "future studies should capitalize on the recent progress of grain alignment theory .",
    "for instance , it is advisable to take into account that the attenuated light in molecular clouds can be decomposed into the dipole and quadrupole components and take into account the theoretical predictions for the alignment by these components obtained in hl08c .",
    "for example , comparing figures  [ chi]b and [ cloud]a one can see that the alignment by the dipole component corresponds to a larger , compared to a beam , parameter space with high-@xmath16 attractor points .     and both low-@xmath16 and high-@xmath16 attractor points for the case of grains subject to external dipole radiation .",

    "another important development is that the grain alignment is no longer a concern of interstellar experts only .",
    "examples in this review as well as in lazarian ( 2007 ) convincingly show that one should account for aligned grains dealing with different environments , e.g. accretion disks , circumstellar regions , interplanetary space and comets .",
    "understanding of the polarization from dust in diffuse media is also a burning issue for the cmb polarization research .",
    "our review above is devoted to the recent developments in the theory of rat alignment .",
    "however , we know the limitations of the rat mechanism . for instance , rats are inefficient in aligning grains for which @xmath66 ( see figure  [ wavelength]b ) . therefore for sufficiently small grains other mechanisms should be important . for instance , lazarian & draine ( 2000 ) introduced a new process , which they termed `` resonance paramagnetic relaxation '' and showed that this process can be important for the alignment of very small grains or pahs , which are responsible for the galactic anomalous microwave emission ( draine & lazarian 1998 ) .",
    "we believe that there are other circumstances when other alignment processes take over .",
    "for instance , the mechanical alignment of helical grains introduced by lazarian & hoang ( 2007b ) may compete with the rat alignment in particular circumstances .",
    "future research should identify , on the basis of comparing theoretical predictions and observations , these circumstances .    as it is not possible to cover the subject of grain alignment within a short review ,",
    "we address our reader to earlier reviews , where particular facets of the grain alignment problem are presented in more detail .",
    "the most detailed review to this moment is lazarian ( 2007 ) , which , however , in terms of the alignment theory , does not cover the most recent developments . thus lazarian ( 2007 ) is complementary to the present review .",
    "reviews written earlier than 2007 are mostly outdated in terms of the rat alignment .",
    "however , lazarian ( 2003 ) review may be recommended for those who are interested in the history of grain alignment ideas .",
    "the connection between grain alignment and cmb polarization studies is discussed in lazarian ( 2008 ) review .",
