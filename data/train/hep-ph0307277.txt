    "the study of cp violation in its multiple aspects is likely to continue playing a crucial role in testing the standard model(sm ) and in searching for new physics .",
    "so far , all experimental data on flavour physics and cp violation @xcite are in agreement with the sm  and its kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "this agreement is impressive , since one has to accommodate a large number of data with only a few parameters .",
    "the cabibbo , kobayashi and maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is characterized by four parameters which one can choose to be the three angles @xmath0 and the phase @xmath1 of the standard parametrization @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) can be determined by the experimental value of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . once these parameters are fixed , one has to fit , using only the phase @xmath1 , a large amount of data , such as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "it is remarkable that these five experimental quantities can be fitted with only one parameter , namely the km phase @xmath1 .    in spite of this success of the sm ,",
    "the search for new physics through the study of cp violation phenomena is well motivated by various reasons , such as :    \\i ) cp violation is closely related to the least understood aspects of the sm , namely the higgs sector and the structure of yukawa couplings .",
    "\\ii ) almost any extension of the sm has new sources of cp violation .",
    "\\iii ) cp violation is one of the crucial ingredients needed to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "it has been established that the strength of cp violation in the sm is not sufficient to generate the observed bau .",
    "therefore , in all successful baryogenesis scenarios , including baryogenesis through leptogenesis @xcite , new sources of cp violation are present .",
    "\\iv ) although cp violation can be incorporated in the sm through the introduction of complex yukawa couplings , one would like to have a deeper understanding of the origin of cp violation .",
    "such an understanding will certainly require a framework of physics beyond the sm .",
    "one may ask , for example , the question whether there are any connections among the various possible manifestations of cp violation , namely those in the quark sector , and in the leptonic sector .",
    "in particular one may ask whether there is any relation between leptonic cp violation observable in neutrino oscillations and cp violation needed for leptogenesis @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . or one may also wonder whether all manifestations of cp violation have a common origin @xcite .    in most of the extensions of the sm ,",
    "it is necessary to control the new sources of cp violation in order to conform to the experimental value of @xmath14 , as well as to the experimental limits on the electric dipole moments of the neutron and the electron .",
    "a notable example is the supersymmetric extension of the sm , where in general a very large number of new phases arise , leading to the so called supersymmetric cp problem , which can be solved by either assuming that the new phases are small or by having an alternative suppression mechanism @xcite .",
    "+ we will not present a general discussion of models of cp violation since it is beyond the scope of this contribution .",
    "instead , we will divide models of cp violation into two broad classes , based on the nature of cp breaking , which may be spontaneous or explicit .",
    "one of the motivations for having spontaneous cp violation , as emphasized by lee @xcite in his pioneering work is puting the breaking of cp on the same footing as the breaking of gauge symmetry , which is spontaneously broken .",
    "another motivation has to do with the fact that spontaneous cp breaking provides an alternative solution to the strong cp problem @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite ( apart from the peccei quinn solution @xcite ) in models where @xmath15 naturally vanishes at tree level and it is calculable in higher orders .",
    "furthermore , it was shown some time ago that cp can be spontaneously broken in string theory @xcite and more recently it has been pointed out that in some string theory compactifications , cp is an exact gauge symmetry and thus its breaking has to be spontaneous @xcite .",
    "indeed , one of the basic questions one may ask about cp is whether it is explicitly broken at the lagrangian level or , on the contrary , it is a good symmetry of the lagrangian , spontaneously broken by the vacuum .",
    "it is remarkable that two of the most interesting models of cp violation , suggested in the early days of gauge theories were published in the same year ( 1973 ) and belong to each one of the above categories .",
    "we are refering to the two - higgs - doublet - model ( thdm ) suggested by lee , where cp is spontaneously broken and the celebrated km model @xcite where cp is explicitly broken at the lagrangian level , through the introduction of complex yukawa couplings .",
    "next we consider some of the simplest extensions of the sm which allow for spontaneous cp violation .      it can be readily shown that in the sm with only one higgs doublet , cp can not be spontaneously broken .",
    "lee has proposed a minimal extension of the sm where spontaneous cp violation ( scpv ) can be achieved , through the introduction of two higgs doublets . due to the presence in the higgs potential of terms of the form @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18",
    "the potencial is sensitive to the relative phase between the vevs of the two neutral higgs fields , @xmath19 .",
    "there is a region of the parameters of the higgs potential for which its minimum corresponds to a non vanishing @xmath20 .",
    "this leads in general to spontaneous cp violation . at the time lee",
    "suggested this model , only two ( incomplete ) generations were known . in this case , the only source of cp violation was higgs exchange .",
    "if one considers the thdm with scpv in the framework of the 3-fermion - generations sm , a non - trivial km phase is generated in the ckm matrix , in spite of the fact that yukawa couplings are real .",
    "this can be readily verified , by noting that the quark mass matrices for the down and up quarks have the form :    @xmath21 \\\\   & \\\\ m_u & = { 1 \\over \\sqrt{2 } } \\left [ v_1 e^{-",
    "i \\theta_1 } y^u_1 + v_2 e^{- i \\theta_2 } y^u_2 \\right ] \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 stand for the yukawa coupling matrices .",
    "one obtains for the hermitian quark mass matrices :    @xmath23    \\label{hdd } \\\\",
    "h_u & \\equiv m_u m^{\\dag}_u   =   { 1 \\over 2 } [ v^2_1 y^u_1 y^{ut}_1 + v^2_2 y^u_2 y^{ut}_2   \\nonumber \\\\   & + v_1 v_2 ( y^u_1 y^{ut}_2 + y^u_2 y^{u t}_1 ) \\cos \\theta   \\nonumber\\\\    &   + i v_1 v_2 ( y^u_1 y^{u t}_2 - y^u_2 y^{u t}_1 ) \\sin \\theta ] \\label{huu } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    although there is only one physical phase , namely @xmath20 , it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ hdd ] ) and ( [ huu ] ) that due to the arbitrariness of @xmath22 , the matrices @xmath24 are arbitrary hermitian matrices . as a result",
    ", there will be in general a non - trivial cp violating phase in the ckm matrix .",
    "for any specific choice of @xmath22 this can be explicitly verified by computing the invariant @xcite quantity @xmath25 ^ 3 $ ] . for three fermion generations the non - vanishing of this weak - basis invariant is a necessary and sufficient condition for having cp violation mediated by charged weak - interactions .    from the above discussion , one concludes that in the three fermion generations version of the lee model , one has two sources of cp violation , namely :    \\i ) the usual km mechanism contributing to cp violation in decay amplitudes as well as to @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 mixings through the usual box diagrams .",
    "\\ii ) flavour - changing neutral higgs mediated interactions giving additional tree level contributions to the neutral meson mixings mentioned in i ) .",
    "the above generalization of the lee model to three fermion generations illustrates a very common situation , where one has the km mechanism , together with other sources of cp violation .",
    "one of the potential drawbacks of the lee model , is the fact that the existence of higgs mediated flavour - changing neutral currents(fcnc ) at tree level requires very heavy neutral scalars , of the order of a few tev , unless there is some suppression mechanism @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in the framework of two - higgs - doublets models , the introduction of appropriate discrete symmetries @xcite leads to the suppression of the fcnc vertex between , for example , two down - type quarks i and j by products of the ckm matrix elements of the type @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes one of the up - type quarks . in the case",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 this suppression is quite strong , and in that class of models neutral higgs may be relatively light ( e.g. 100 - 200 gev ) , even in the presence of higgs mediated fcnc .",
    "one may , of course , eliminate altogether fcnc in the two - higgs - doublets models by implementing natural flavour conservation ( nfc ) in the higgs sector through a @xmath34 discrete symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , in this case , the structure of the higgs potential is such that no spontaneous cp violation can be achieved , unless the discrete symmetry is softly broken @xcite . if one insists on nfc , then a minimum number of three higgs doublets are necessary in order to achieve spontaneous cp violation @xcite .",
    "this class of models with nfc , three higgs doublets and scpv has the special feature that the ckm matrix is real @xcite and cp violation arises exclusively through higgs exchange @xcite .",
    "the essential reason why the ckm is real in this case has to do with the fact that the @xmath34 symmetry constrains @xmath35 to couple to only one of the higgs doublets ( and similarly for @xmath36 ) . in this case",
    ", any phase can be rotated away from the quark mass matrices , through a redefinition of the righthanded quark fields . in the version of the three higgs - doublet model , with explicit cp violation @xcite and in the presence of three fermion generations ,",
    "one has again two sources of cp violation , namely the km mechanism and higgs exchange .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) has two higgs doublets and therefore it is a natural candidate to achieve scpv .",
    "however , it is not possible to obtain scpv in the mssm at tree level , due essentially to the fact that susy does not allow some of the couplings which are present in the general thdm .",
    "since susy has to be softly broken , radiative corrections can induce new cp violating operators which could induce cp breaking @xcite .",
    "however , the possibility that radiative corrections can cause scpv , requires the existence of a light scalar @xcite which is excluded by lep .",
    "it has been shown that one may achieve scpv in the next - to - minimal - supersymmetric - standard - model ( nmssm ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite where a singlet superfield is added to the higgs sector . in this case , the ckm matrix is real @xcite , essentially due to the same reason explained above for the 3-higgs doublet model with scpv and nfc . in the nmssm with scpv",
    "all couplings are real , so that cp is a good symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "however the physical relative phases of the higgs doublet and singlet enter in the chargino and neutralino mass matrices as well as in some vertices .",
    "as a result , it has been shown that chargino box diagrams can generate @xcite the observed experimetal value of @xmath14 . as far as @xmath10 , and @xmath37 ,",
    "it has been pointed out that susy contributions in these models can saturate the experimental values @xcite @xcite , provided there is maximal lr squark mixing .      if one maintains the fermion spectrum of the sm , the thdm suggested by lee has the simplest higgs structure needed to generate spontaneous cp breaking capable of accounting for the experimentally observed cp violation .",
    "however , it is possible to generate relevant spontaneous cp violation with only one higgs doublet @xmath38 and one complex scalar singlet @xmath39 , provided that one also introduces at least one singlet charge @xmath40 vectorial quark @xmath41 .",
    "the scalar potential will contain terms in @xmath38 and s with no phase dependence , together with terms of the form which , in general , lead to the spontaneous breaking of t and cp invariance @xcite with @xmath38 and @xmath39 acquiring vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the form : @xmath42    in this class of models the presence of the vector - like quark @xmath41 plays a crucial r^ ole , since it is through the couplings @xmath43 that the phase @xmath30 appears in the effective mass matrix for the down standard - like quarks .",
    "it can be shown that the phase @xmath44 , generated through spontaneous cp violation is not suppressed by factors of @xmath45 . for very large @xmath46 ( e.g. @xmath46 @xmath47 gev ) , @xmath44 is the only leftover effect at low energies , from spontaneous cp breaking at high energies .",
    "for not so large a value of @xmath46 ( e.g. , @xmath46 of the order of a few tev ) the appearance of significant flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) in the down quark sector leads to new contributions to @xmath48 and @xmath49 mixing which can alter @xcite some of the predictions of the sm for cp asymmetries in b meson decays .",
    "these fcnc are closely related to the non - unitarity of the @xmath50 ckm matrix , with both effects suppressed by powers of @xmath45 .",
    "+ this class of models has been extended to the leptonic sector where the role of vector - like quarks is played by the righthanded neutrinos .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that in such a framework , all manifestations of cp violation may have a common origin .",
    "in particular , the phase @xmath30 defined in eq.(4 ) generates cp violation in the quark sector , in the leptonic sector at low energies ( measurable for example in neutrino oscillations ) , as well as cp violation required by leptogenesis .",
    "from the discussion in the previous section it should be clear that when one considers extensions of the sm , the most common situation is having the usual km mechanism , together with other sources of cp violation .",
    "this is of course the case when one assumes that cp is explicitly broken at the lagrangian level .",
    "what is remarkable , is the fact that it is also true for some of the models of scpv , where all the couplings of the lagrangian are real .",
    "+ in our analysis , we will assume that the tree level weak decays are dominated by the sm w - exchange diagrams , thus implying that the extraction of @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 from experiment continues to be valid even in the presence of new physics ( np ) . we will allow for contributions from np in processes like @xmath27 mixing and @xmath28 mixing , as well as in penguin diagrams . since the sm contributes to these processes only at loop level ,",
    "the effects of np are more likely to be detectable .",
    "examples of processes which are sensitive to np , are the cp asymmetries corresponding to the decays @xmath51 and @xmath52 which are affected by np contributions to @xmath27 mixing .",
    "significant contributions to @xmath27 and @xmath28 mixing can arise in many of the extensions of the sm , such as models with vector - like quarks @xcite and supersymmetric extensions of the sm @xcite .",
    "vector - like quarks naturally arise in theories with large extra - dimensions @xcite , as well as in some grand - unified theories like @xmath53 .",
    "as previously mentioned , the presence of vector - like quarks leads to a small deviation of @xmath50 unitarity of @xmath54 which in turn leads to z - mediated new contributions to @xmath27 and @xmath28 mixings . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "the size of susy contributions to @xmath27 and @xmath28 mixing crucially depends on the choice of soft - breaking terms , but there is a wide range of the parameter space where susy contributions can be significant .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out @xcite that in the context of susy so(10 ) , there is an interesting connection between the observed large mixing in atmospheric neutrinos and the size of the susy contribution to @xmath28 mixing , which is expected to be large in this class of models .",
    "+ the standard way of testing the compatibility of the sm with the existing data consists of adopting the wolfenstein parametrization @xcite and plotting in the @xmath55 , @xmath56 plane the constraints derived from various experimental inputs , like the value of @xmath9 , the size of @xmath57 , the value of @xmath37 , as well as the strength of @xmath27 and @xmath28 mixings .",
    "the challenge for the sm is then to find a region in the @xmath55 , @xmath56 plane where all the constraints are simultaneously satisfied . a complementary way of testing the sm , consists of using exact relations connecting measurable quantities , namely moduli of @xmath54 and the arguments of rephasing invariant quartets .",
    "these relations can be derived in the framework of the sm and follow from the implicit assumption of unitarity of @xmath54 .",
    "they have the interesting feature of being independent of any particular parametrization of the quark mixing matrix .      using the freedom to rephase quark fields",
    ", it can be readily shown that the @xmath50 sector of a ckm matrix of arbitrary size contains only four independent rephasing invariant phases .",
    "it is convenient to make the following choice : @xmath58 furthermore , in order to fix the invariant phases entering in @xmath59 cp asymmetries , it is useful to adopt the following phase convention  @xcite : @xmath60 through the measurement of cp asymmetries , one can obtain the phases of the rephasing invariant quantities : @xmath61 the first factor in @xmath62 is due to mixing and its phase equals @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "let us consider the general case where new physics ( np ) also contributes to the mixing .",
    "it is convenient to parametrize the np contributions in the following way : @xmath67 in the presence of np , the phases from mixing become @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 decays , respectively .",
    "it is clear that @xmath70 and/or @xmath71 would signal the presence of np .",
    "it is not easy to separate @xmath72 from a possible np contribution ( @xmath73 ) in @xmath74 decays like @xmath75 .",
    "this renders specially important the measurement of @xmath76 , which does not suffer from contamination of np in the mixing .",
    "note that @xmath76 can be either directly measured @xcite or obtained through the knowledge of the asymmetries @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "indeed the phase @xmath79 cancels in the sum @xmath80 and one has : @xmath81\\label{arcsin}\\ ] ] note that we are using @xmath82 that can be extracted from the experimental asymmetry through various different approaches @xcite .",
    "once @xmath76 is known , @xmath83 can be readily obtained , using unitarity and the knowledge of @xmath8 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath83 , together with @xmath84 leads then to the determination of @xmath79 .",
    "of course , this evaluation of @xmath79 will be restricted by the precision on @xmath85 , since @xmath6 , @xmath7 are extracted from experiment with good accuracy .",
    "similar considerations apply to the extraction of @xmath86 , @xmath87 or @xmath88 from @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 or its ratio , have to be reconstructed previously using unitarity .      using orthogonality of different rows and different columns of @xmath54",
    ", one can obtain various exact relations involving moduli and rephasing invariant phases , such as : @xmath91 since the above formulae have the potential of providing precise tests of the sm , we have opted for writing exact relations .",
    "however , it is obvious that given the experimental knowledge on the size of the various moduli of the ckm matrix elements , some of the above relations can be , to an excellent approximation , substituted by simpler ones . for example , eq.([rel15 ] ) is the exact version of the aleksan - london - kayser relation @xcite , the importance of which has been emphasized by silva and wolfenstein @xcite : @xmath92 similarly eq.([rel5 ] ) can be well approximated by : @xmath93 while eqs.([rel10 ] ) and ( [ rel8 ] ) lead , respectively to : @xmath94 it is worthwhile to illustrate how these relations can be used to test the sm :    * eq.([rel5 ] ) and its approximate form eq.([rel17 ] ) would provide an excellent test of the sm , once @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath83 are measured .",
    "note that the theoretical errors in extracting @xmath97 from @xmath27 and @xmath28 mixings are much smaller than those present in the extraction of @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "* eq.([rel19 ] ) has the important feature of only involving quantities which are not sensitive to the possible presence of new physics in @xmath27 mixing .",
    "it has , of course , the disadvantage of requiring the knowledge of @xmath8 with significant precision , in order to be a precise test of the sm .",
    "* eq.([rel18 ] ) gives , to an excellent approximation , @xmath96 in terms of @xmath76 and @xmath83 .",
    "this relation will provide an important test of the sm once @xmath96 , @xmath76 and @xmath100 are measured .",
    "note that in the sm , one knows that @xmath96 is of order @xmath6 , the importance of eq.([rel18 ] ) is that it provides the constant of proportionality .    in the context of the sm",
    "the above formulae can also be very useful for a precise determination of @xmath54 from input data : for example , if @xmath83 and @xmath76 are measured with sufficient accuracy , one can use eqs.([rel9 ] ) , ( [ rel10 ] ) to determine @xmath8 , @xmath98 .",
    "one can thus reconstruct the full ckm matrix , using @xmath101 , @xmath7 , @xmath83 and @xmath76 as input parameters .",
    "furthermore we can also predict the sm value for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the above expressions can also be used to detect , in a quantitative way , the presence of new physics in @xmath27 and or @xmath28 mixings .",
    "for example , eq.([rel9 ] ) , we see that this unitarity relation can only be affected by the presence of @xmath79 , therefore this equation allows for a clean extraction of @xmath79 . by writing eq.([rel9 ] ) in terms of @xmath104 and @xmath79 ( note that @xmath105 ) we get @xmath106 with @xmath107    from eq.([phid ] ) , we can find out the bounds that can be reached for @xmath79 , once we have a direct measurement of @xmath76 . to illustrate the usefulness of eqs.([rel9 ] ) and ( [ phid ] ) one can consider examples of different sets of assumed data which hopefully will be available in the near future . for definiteness let us consider the most optimistic scenario , where np is discovered , corresponding to the following example : @xmath108 the resulting @xmath73 distribution is presented in fig.[fidnpcaso1 ] corresponding    to @xmath109 in this case , one would have a clear indication of np in the phase of @xmath27 mixing .",
    "note that for this choice of @xmath110 the value of @xmath9 would not be saturated by the sm contribution .",
    "therefore , in this example one would conclude that np also contributes to @xmath9 .",
    "we have described the main features of cp violation in a variety of models beyond the sm , emphasizing that the most common situation is having the km mechanism together with some extra sources of cp violation .",
    "often this new physics gives additional contributions to @xmath27 and @xmath28 mixings which can affect the predictions for the various cp asymmetries .",
    "furthermore , we have pointed out that the sm predicts a series of exact relations connecting measurable quantities like moduli and rephasing invariant quartets of the ckm matrix which provide a stringent test of the sm , with the potential of revealing new physics .",
    "this is specially true if , on the one hand , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and eventually @xmath112 are measured in the present or future b factories and , on the other hand , there is a significant decrease in the theoretical uncertainties in the evaluation of the relevant hadronic matrix elements .",
    "these tests may complement the standard analysis in the @xmath113 , @xmath114 plane .    in the search for new physics through cp violation ,",
    "the first step is , of course , to find a clear deviation from the predictions of the sm for flavour physics and cp violation .",
    "if the need for new physics is established through , for example , the appearance of new contributions to @xmath27 and/or @xmath28 mixings , a much more difficult task will be to differentiate among the various models where such new contributions may arise .",

    "<S> we describe some of the extensions of the sm , including models with spontaneous cp violation , where new physics relevant for cp violation may arise . it is emphasized that the sm predicts a series of exact relations among various measurable quantities , such as moduli of ckm matrix elements and rephasing invariant phases . </S>",
    "<S> these exact relations provide a stringent test of the sm , with the potential to reveal new physics . </S>"
