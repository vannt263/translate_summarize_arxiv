    "one of the fundamental problems in statistical mechanics concerns the microscopic origin of dissipation and relaxation of a nonequilibrium system in its course toward equilibrium with the thermal bath .",
    "it is known that the particle moving in a randomly fluctuating medium undergoes brownian motion .",
    "a phenomenological but rather successful approach to study the evolution of brownin motion is by means of the langevin equation .",
    "this langevin equation is a classical equation of motion by phenomenologically adding the terms that account for the effects of dissipation and fluctuations under the influence of a fluctuating environment .",
    "these two effects are ultimately responsible for evolving into thermodynamic equilibrium of the brownian particle with the bath , and are thus related by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) .",
    "the fdt is one of the cornerstones of statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "static _ version of the fdt  @xcite relates the response of a system in equilibrium to action of a small external perturbation .",
    "the result of it gives a relation between noise correlations and susceptibility in frequency domain and the proportionality constant depends on temperature .",
    "the extension of the _ static _ fdt to the situation away from equilibrium can be realized in terms of the langevin equation .",
    "the einstein relation , one of the manifestations of the _ dynamic _ fdt , links the effects between friction and noise correlations in the langevin equation , and thus plays an essential role in stabilizing the dynamics of the brownian particle .",
    "the most striking feature of this relation is that it can determine the irreversible evolution of the particle from the fluctuations correlation of the heat bath .",
    "thus , the origin of this irreversibility of the brownian dynamics can be attributed to the fluctuating nature of the environment .",
    "a very clear microscopic description , leading to the langevin equation , within the context of one - particle quantum mechanics has been presented by caldeira and leggett .",
    "they considered a specific system - environment model that the particle interacts with an environment composed of a infinite number of harmonic oscillators by linear coupling of the oscillator and particle coordinates  @xcite .",
    "if the quantum states of harmonic oscillators are thermally distributed , the relative importance between quantum and thermal fluctuations depends on the temperature under consideration .",
    "the effects of environmental degrees of freedom on the particle can be investigated with the method of feynman - vernon influence functional by integrating out environment variables within the context of the closed - time - path formalism  @xcite .",
    "the more complicated interaction by considering nonlinear couplings of the particle coordinate can also be studied perturbatively in  @xcite . under the classical approximation where the intrinsic quantum fluctuations of the particle is ignored",
    ", the langevin equation can be obtained by minimizing the corresponding effective stochastic action .    at low temperatures ,",
    "the particle is affected mainly by quantum fluctuations of the environment , and it will lead to a new phenomenon , the so - called quantum brownian motion .",
    "many experimentally accessible systems ( such as dissipation in quantum tunneling )  @xcite , and the problems of quantum measurement theory ( such as quantum decoherence of the system due to the interaction with its environment )  @xcite share the similar dynamics as quantum brownian motion . at high temperatures in which the thermal fluctuations dominate ,",
    "the problem of brownian motion is described by the classical dynamics introduced in the previous paragraph . the relativistic brownian motion",
    "has also been discussed in  @xcite .    here",
    "we would like to stress that under the approach of feynman - vernon influence functional , the corresponding fdt can be _ derived _ from first principles for a given microscopic model in terms of the green s functions of environment variables .",
    "the fdt is a central theorem in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics by which the evolution of velocity fluctuations of the particle under a fluctuating environment is intimately related to its dissipative behavior .",
    "thus , in this paper , we wish to explore the dynamics of the brownian particle in the supraohmic environment where backreaction dissipation is governed by the term with high - order time derivatives of the position than the one ( a first - order time derivative ) in a ohmic case .",
    "the known example is the motion of the charged particle under the electromagnetic fluctuations at finite temperature",
    ". the non - uniform motion of the charge will emit radiation that backreacts on itself through the electromagnetic self - force given by a third - order time derivative of the position .",
    "the stochastic noise , which encodes the influence of quantum / thermal statistics of the fields , drives the charge into a fluctuating motion  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that , in nonrelativistic motion , the dissipation term is significant only on an extremely short time scale , which is the time for light to travel across the classical radius of the charged particle , @xmath0 for an electron .",
    "it is then of interest to find out the mechanism by which the velocity fluctuations saturate , when backreaction dissipation is negligible during the evolution , that is , when the particle barely moves in a supraohmic environment .",
    "the dynamics of a charged particle coupled with the electromagnetic fields has been studied quantum - mechanically in the system - plus - environment approach .",
    "we treat the particle as the system of interest , and the degrees of freedom of fields as the environment .",
    "the effects of fields on the particle is then obtained by integrating out field variables  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the decoherence phenomena of the charged particle under the influence of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations in the presence of the conducting plate has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of charge s velocity dispersion affected by quantum electromagnetic fields near a conducting plate  @xcite and from the electromagnetic squeezed vacuum  @xcite are also studied . in the latter works ,",
    "we investigate the possibility of reducing the velocity dispersion of the charged particle by tuning the parameters in these quantum states . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors have shown that if the particle dose not move significantly such that the electromagnetic self - force can be ignored , then the velocity dispersion _ still _ reaches a constant value at asymptotical times .",
    "thus , constrained by the uncertainty principle , it is quite reasonable that the particle can not extract energy indefinitely from the vacuum state of environment fields .",
    "it results from the fact that the integral of the correlation function of stochastic forces , which will be defined later , over the whole time domain vanishes .",
    "similar results are also obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . as will be seen later",
    ", it will also lead to the saturation of velocity fluctuations of a brwonian particle under a supraohmic environment at _",
    "finite temperature_. this work is a follow - up from our earlier investigations@xcite , where more details on derivation can be found .    the lorentz - heaviside units with @xmath1 will be adopted unless otherwise noted .",
    "the metric is @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamics of a nonrelativistic point particle of charge @xmath3 interacting with the quantized electromagnetic fields can be described by the lagrangian , @xmath4=\\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{\\mathbf{q}}^2-\\frac{1}{2 }      \\int\\!d^3\\mathbf{x}\\,d^3\\mathbf{y}\\;\\varrho(x;\\mathbf{q})g(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})\\varrho(y;\\mathbf{q } )      + \\int\\!d^3\\mathbf{x}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu\\mathbf{a}_{\\mathrm{t}})^2+\\mathbf{j}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\right]\\,,\\ ] ] in terms of the transverse components of the gauge potential @xmath5 , and the position @xmath6 of the point charge in the coulomb gauge .",

    "we assume that the state of the particle - field at an initial time @xmath12 is facterizable as @xmath13 , and that the electromagnetic fields are initially in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath14 so that its density operator takes the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the hamiltonian of the free fields .    after integrating out the degrees of freedom of the fields ,",

    "it is seen that the influence of the electromagnetic fields are expressed by an integral of the dissipation kernel @xmath21 over the past history of charge s motion , and by a stochastic noise @xmath22 that drives the charge into a fluctuating motion . as it stands , eq .",
    "is a nonlinear langevin equation with non - markovian backreaction , and the noise depends in a complicated way on the charge s trajectory because the noise correlation function itself is a functional of the trajectory .",
    "the fluctuation and dissipation effects of the electromagnetic fields on the motion of the charged particle are associated with the kernels @xmath23 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "they in turn are linked by the fluctuation - dissipation relation where the fourier transform of the fluctuation kernel @xmath23 is related to the imaginary part of the retarded kernel @xmath21 as follows  @xcite @xmath24=\\operatorname{im}\\left\\{g_{r}^{ij}[{\\bf q}(t),{\\bf q}(t');\\omega]\\right\\}\\coth\\left[\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega}{2}\\right]\\ , .",
    "\\label{df - t}\\ ] ] this relation is established from first principles .",
    "the explicit expression of the kernels @xmath23 and @xmath21 will be introduced when they are needed later .",
    "the nonlinear , non - markovian langevin equations are far too complicated to proceed further without any approximation . the appropriate approximation for nonrelativistic motion is the dipole approximation , which amounts to considering the backreaction solely from the electric fields .",
    "the langevin equation under the dipole approximation reduces to @xmath25 from eq .   and",
    "@xmath26 the retarded green s function in the dipole approximation is denoted by @xmath27 , and can be expressed in terms of the spectral density @xmath28 as @xmath29 in the isotropic thermal bath , the spectral density takes a simple form  @xcite @xmath30 the accompanying noise - noise correlation functions due to the fluctuations of the electric fields at finite temperature are given by @xmath31 with @xmath32\\cos(k\\tau)\\,.\\ ] ] again the noise kernel @xmath33 can be seen related to the dissipation kernel @xmath34 via a fluctuation - dissipation relation under the dipole approximation , derived from eq .  .",
    "after carrying out the integration in eq .",
    "the langevin equation becomes physically more transparent , @xmath35 the non - uniform motion of the charge results in radiation that backreacts on the charge itself through the electromagnetic self - force .",
    "this backreaction occurs at the moment when radiation is emitted  @xcite .",
    "thus , it may lead to short - distance divergence in the coincidence limit due to the assumption of a point - like particle .",
    "this ultraviolet divergence must be regularized to have a finite and unambiguous result .",
    "the divergent part is absorbed by particle mass renormalization , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the energy cutoff scale related to the inverse of the charge s wavepacket width .",
    "it essentially quantifies the intrinsic uncertainty of the charged particle .",
    "then the finite backreaction effect is given by the well - known result , a third - order time derivative of the position  @xcite .",
    "for a nonrelativistic particle , the introduced cutoff wavelength should be much larger than its compton wavelength , namely @xmath38 , and in turn much greater than the classical radius of the charged particle , @xmath39 .",
    "thus , when the time scale associated with the cutoff frequency , @xmath40 , is much longer than the characteristic time scale @xmath41 , an extremely short time scale , the electromagnetic self - force can be safely ignored .",
    "if we assume that the charged particle starts off from the rest at @xmath42 , then the solution to the langevin equation has a very simple form @xmath43 and the corresponding velocity dispersion is given by @xmath44 we see that the evolution of velocity fluctuations is governed by the force - force correction function , whose finite temperature contribution @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 where its vacuum part has been subtracted .",
    "@xmath47 is the @xmath48th derivative of the zeta function .",
    "the correlation function @xmath49 is plotted against the time difference @xmath50 , scaled by @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ fi : cffs ] .",
    "it shows that the stochastic noise tends to have positive correlation for small @xmath52 , and then @xmath49 turns negative at @xmath53 .",
    "it means that if we measure the electric field at certain time and find out the field points to one particular direction , then the moment @xmath52 later , within the time difference of order @xmath54 , if we perform a similar measurement again at the same location , there is high probability that the direction of the electric field remains the same .",
    "however , when the time difference between measurements is greater than @xmath54 , we probably have the result that the electric field points to the opposite direction instead of the same direction .",
    "another way of understanding its significance is to compute the mean power @xmath55 done by the stochastic force @xmath56 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the @xmath48th derivative of the digamma function @xmath59 . again here only the finite temperature contribution is considered .",
    "we see that the mean power is positive at early times where the stochastic force does positive work to the charge such that its velocity dispersion or kinetic energy increases with time .",
    "the power reaches the maximum value at the time when correlation turns negative .",
    "later on , the negative correlation makes the work done by the force less positive and then the mean power @xmath55 eventually approaches zero , @xmath60 then the finite temperature part of the velocity dispersion @xmath61 can be obtained by @xmath62\\\\                      & = \\frac{2}{3\\pi^2m^2_r}\\frac{\\hbar\\,e^2}{\\beta^{2}\\hbar^2 }                          \\begin{cases }                                  \\dfrac{\\pi^4}{30}\\dfrac{t^2}{\\beta^2\\hbar^2}+\\mathcal{o}(\\dfrac{t}{\\beta\\hbar})^4\\ , , & t\\ll\\beta\\hbar\\,,\\\\\\\\                              \\dfrac{\\pi^2}{6}+\\mathcal{o}(\\dfrac{\\beta\\hbar}{t})^2\\,,&t\\gg\\beta\\hbar\\ , .",
    "\\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fi : cors ] we show the time evolution of @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively . it is seen that the averaged power @xmath63 given by stochastic forces on the charged particle is positive for all times .",
    "this implies that the thermal bath keeps pumping energy to the particle during its evolution and increases the velocity dispersion .",
    "the presence of the negative correlation slows down the rate of energy transfer , and finally leads to the vanishing @xmath65 at asymptotic times where velocity fluctuations are saturated .",
    "it implies that the integral of @xmath49 over the whole time domain vanishes , i.e. @xmath66 thus , the contribution from the positive correlation for the small @xmath67 regime exactly cancels that from the negative correlation for the larger @xmath52 regime .",
    "it leads to the saturation of the velocity dispersion even though the self force is insignificant in this supraohmic case .    to understand eq .   and its consequence from a different aspect , we may rewrite the correlation function in terms of its fourier transform @xmath68 then the integration of the correlation function over the whole time domain becomes @xmath69 if @xmath70 behaves like @xmath71 with @xmath72 , then eq .   holds . thus , whether the integral of the correlation function over the whole time domain vanishes or not relies on the behavior of @xmath70 in the zero momentum limit , which in turn depends on the spacetime dimension of the system , the dispersion relation of the environment field , and the coupling between the particle and environment .    in electrodynamics ,",
    "the dynamics of a charged particle is governed by a local , gauge invariant interaction with the electromagnetic fields . under the prescription of minimal coupling ,",
    "the transverse component of the vector potential couples to the charged current density , which is proportional to the time derivative of particle s position .",
    "this derivative coupling gives rise to the fact that the electromagnetic self - force should be given by a third - order time derivative of the position , and it is called supraohmic dynamics  @xcite . from eq .",
    ", we see that @xmath73 and hence eq",
    ".   holds . in this supraohmic case",
    ", the saturation of velocity dispersion can be achieved due to negative force - force correlations even when the backreaction effect of the self - force is found negligible in the evolution .",
    "this is in striking contrast with the brownian motion under an ohmic environment , characterized by the dissipative backreaction of the first - order time derivative of particle s position .",
    "it involves the coordinate coupling of the particle with the environment  @xcite , and then @xmath74 .",
    "the positive force - force correlation  @xcite has been shown to drive the growth of the velocity dispersion linearly in time within a time scale shorter than the relaxation time .",
    "it is also found  @xcite that the integration on the force - force correlation function for the whole time regime then has a nonzero value with @xmath74 , so the energy transferred from the environment to the particle during the whole evolution of particle s motion never slows down to halt .",
    "then the dissipative backreaction must be taken into account to counterbalance the effect from the force fluctuations in order to finally stabilize the value of the velocity dispersion .",
    "moreover , from the aspect of energy balancing between dissipative and fluctuation backreations , the stronger dissipation is expected to occur in the subohmic case with @xmath75 , because the energy transfer rate increases even faster at late times  @xcite .",
    "thus , the mechanisms to stabilize the velocity dispersion of a particle in a fluctuating subohmic , ohmic , or supraohmic environment are rather different .",
    "in this paper , the evolution of velocity fluctuations of the brownian particle in a supraohmic environment is studied by considering the motion of the charged particle coupled to electromagnetic fluctuations at finite temperature .",
    "the langevin equation of the particle incorporates the effects of fluctuation and dissipation backreaction in a self - consistent manner .",
    "in particular , the backreaction in a form of the electromagnetic self - force on the charge is a third - order time derivative of the position in this supraohmic environment . on the other hand ,",
    "the thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields are manifested as stochastic noise .",
    "its correlation tends to be positive at shorter time difference @xmath52 , and then turns negative at @xmath53 .",
    "we show that the integration of the force - force correlation function over the whole time regime vanishes . throughout the evolution",
    ", the self - force can be argued to be insignificant for the charge having no significant motion .",
    "then , the positive correlation contributes to the growth of the velocity dispersion initially , its growth slows down when correlation becomes negative , and finally halts where the velocity dispersion reaches a constant at asymptotical times .",
    "it is a rather different saturation mechanism for the velocity dispersion of the brownian particle in an ohmic environment .",
    "additionally , the saturated value of the kinetic energy of the charge due to the thermal electromagnetic fluctuations at temperature @xmath76 can be estimated by @xmath77 with the fine structure constant @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath79 dependence implies that the saturated value of the velocity dispersion in this supraohmic case relies on the coupling between the system and the environment .",
    "the issue on how the velocity dispersion of the brownian particle is stabilized in the subohmic environment deserves further investigation .",
    "thus , it comes to no surprise that the above saturated value of the velocity dispersion roughly becomes the value given by the equipartition theorem for a thermodynamic system as long as @xmath80 because in that limit , the temperature is the highest energy scale in the system .",
    "however , in order to correctly describe the system in such a limit , a relativistic / field - theoretic formalism is needed for appropriately describing the dynamics of the charged particle .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the current investigation .",
