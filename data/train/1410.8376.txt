    "the global structure of pulsar magnetosphere remains the key problem of pulsar theory . a rigid must to interpret a wealth of observational manifestations of pulsars greatly stimulates an interest to the magnetospheric physics .",
    "an advanced model of pulsar magnetosphere is thought of as a starting point for understanding the mechanisms of pulsar radio and high - energy emissions , the pulsar wind outflow into the exterior , etc .    in case of pulsars ,",
    "the presence of copious plasma affects the electromagnetic fields in the magnetosphere , making it necessary to treat the fields and currents self - consistently . within the framework of the simplest model ,",
    "the pulsar magnetosphere is presented as an axisymmetric rotator , where the accelerating longitudinal electric field is completely screened by the plasma and the dominant electromagnetic forces are balanced .",
    "such an ideal force - free magnetosphere is described by the well - known pulsar equation @xcite , which relates the magnetic flux and poloidal current . with the solution in hand",
    ", one would automatically obtain the corresponding electric field and charge , reconstructing the general picture of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "unfortunately , for the realistic case of a dipolar magnetic field of the neutron star , the proper analytic solution is yet unknown .",
    "the only exact solution of the pulsar equation was guessed for the monopolar magnetic field @xcite .",
    "although the assumption of the stellar magnetic field in the form of a monopole is somewhat unnatural , the versions of the split @xcite and offset @xcite monopole are believed to mimic the salient features of the force - free dipole well beyond the light cylinder . in the ideal force - free case , the monopolar character of the poloidal magnetic field is preserved , whereas the poloidal current gives rise to the azimuthal magnetic field component .",
    "as a result , the magnetic field lines are archimedean spirals , with the projections in the meridional plane being the radial straight lines .    generally speaking ,",
    "the force - free consideration involves only the charges and currents rather than the particle distributions sustaining them . for the monopolar case , however ,",
    "the appropriate particle distribution was guessed as well @xcite . given that the inertial effects are ignored , the ( massless ) particles stream radially at a speed of light , following the poloidal magnetic field lines .",
    "this result was later on generalized to the case of electromagnetic fields of an arbitrary form ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) : the particles also move at a speed of light , and their velocity is directed so as to preclude radiation damping .    implementation of the numerical methods has led to a marked progress in studying the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "modeling of the axisymmetric force - free dipole @xcite and taking into account differential rotation of the magnetosphere @xcite were followed by a number of further advances ( for a review see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nowadays , it is a common practice to simulate time - dependent inclined dipole in three dimensions @xcite , including the effect of finite conductivity of the plasma @xcite . in parallel to the force - free description of the pulsar magnetosphere , the mhd approach is also developed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , there was an attempt at including the plasma - producing gaps into the global structure of the pulsar magnetosphere @xcite .    in the numerical simulations of the pulsar magnetosphere",
    ", the original force - free result is commonly used as a test for consistency of the numerical procedures .",
    "as the current studies are direct or indirect generalizations of the primordial force - free problem , they mostly inherited its difficulties .",
    "although the particle speed - of - light motion is generally thought of as an inseparable constituent of the force - free picture , it actually appears its weakest point . for the force - free regime to hold",
    "the particle energy should be much less than the magnetic field energy .",
    "at the same time , the energy of the massless particles streaming at a speed of light remains indeterminate .",
    "furthermore , the force - free region can not be directly joined to the region of particle acceleration , where the particle mass can not be neglected and the speed of light can not be arrived at . and finally , the speed - of - light motion of particles in the force - free case is so degenerate that it precludes any radiative processes , whereas interpretation of the pulsar emission is the main motivation for the magnetospheric studies .",
    "the latter difficulty used to be avoided by assuming finite conductivity of the plasma , with the particle mass still being neglected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we relax the restriction of massless particles and consider the two - fluid model of the pulsar magnetosphere in order to include the inertial effects .",
    "the general picture of the two - fluid model is too complicated and allows only simplistic numerical illustrations @xcite .",
    "we use the analytic approach , address the low - mass limit of the model and obtain the particle distributions sustaining the monopolar force - free configuration .",
    "in addition to the customary degenerate speed - of - light solution , there exist realistic electron - positron distributions obeying the two - fluid model at @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the particle mass .",
    "note that actually the small parameter of the problem is of the order of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the rotation frequency of the pulsar , @xmath4 the particle gyrofrequency , @xmath5 the magnetic field strength at the light cylinder , @xmath6 the electron charge and @xmath7 the speed of light .",
    "thus , our low - mass limit may well be called the strong - field one , as is usually done in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although the latter term is undoubtedly more physically meaningful , we choose the former one in order to stress that our consideration is concerned with the vanishingly small inertial effects .    in the present paper",
    ", it is shown that continuity of the plasma flow is satisfied ( and , correspondingly , the two - fluid model can be constructed ) only if the plasma conductivity @xmath8 is assumed",
    ". then the longitudinal electric field component , which is small as @xmath9 , causes the relative shift in the distributions of electrons and positrons @xmath10 .",
    "hence , the global force - free picture appears to depend on the details of particle acceleration .",
    "this demonstrates the proper way to place the force - free magnetosphere into a more general context , including the particle high - energy emission .",
    "thus , our paper presents an attempt at consistent extending the force - free model of the pulsar magnetosphere and in this respect continues the ideology of the previous paper of the series @xcite .",
    "our present consideration yields the simplest non - degenerate description of the pulsar magnetosphere , which may serve as a starting point for further analytic and numerical studies .",
    "but even now a number of new important features are unveiled .",
    "firstly , at distances @xmath11 in units of the light cylinder radius ( where @xmath12 is the initial lorentz - factor of the particle motion ) the particles are subject to strong acceleration . thus , the solution of the so - called @xmath13-problem is already prescribed within the framework of the force - free approximation .",
    "secondly , the shift in the distributions of the particle species possibly implies the two - stream instability , so that the radio emission mechanism may be dictated by the global force - free magnetosphere .",
    "thirdly , the particles perform differential rotation , hinting at the possibility of diochotron instability , which may be responsible for the phenomenon of drifting subpulses . and finally , as the shift in the distributions of the particle species is determined by the accelerating electric field , this may somewhat unexpectedly testify to the physical connection between the radio and high - energy emissions of pulsars .    the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 contains the basics of the self - consistent two - fluid model .",
    "its low - mass limit is examined in sect .",
    "3 . in sect .  4 ,",
    "the implications of our results are discussed .",
    "a brief summary is given in sect .",
    "[ s2 ]      let us consider the stationary axially symmetric magnetosphere of a monopolar structure filled with the copious relativistic electron - positron plasma .",
    "we are interested in the self - consistent description of the fields and particle motions in this case . for convenience",
    "the electric and magnetic field strengths , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are normalized to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the magnetic moment of the neutron star , @xmath18 the light cylinder radius , @xmath19 the magnetic field strength at the neutron star surface , and @xmath20 the stellar radius .",
    "besides that , the velocities are normalized to @xmath7 , the distances to @xmath21 and the electromagnetic forces to @xmath6 .",
    "it is assumed that the electromagnetic force dominates , whereas the particle collisions , pressure , gravitation and radiation damping are negligible .",
    "then the equation of motion for each of the particle species is written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the particle velocities , @xmath24 the corresponding lorentz - factors , and @xmath25 is the resultant numerical factor , @xmath26 . with the normalizations assumed ,",
    "@xmath27 being twice the ratio of the rotation frequency of the neutron star to the particle gyrofrequency at the light cylinder .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath25 will be estimated in the next subsection .    in terms of the particle number densities",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 , the total charge @xmath30 and electric current @xmath31 ( both in units of @xmath6 ) read @xmath32 @xmath33 within the framework of the two - fluid model , the flows of both particle species should be continuous , @xmath34 the electromagnetic fields are given by the maxwell s equations , @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are given by equations  ( [ eq2])-([eq3 ] )",
    ".    the set of equations ( [ eq1])-([eq8 ] ) yields a self - consistent description of the electromagnetic fields and particle motions .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ eq1 ] ) actually presents 6 component equations , equations ( [ eq2])-([eq3 ] ) , ( [ eq5])-([eq8 ] ) contain 8 independent equations , and in equation ( [ eq4 ] ) only one component is independent , since with equation ( [ eq6 ] ) the condition @xmath39 is fulfilled automatically . in total , there are 15 equations for 14 unknowns , namely , the components of the field strengths @xmath14 and @xmath15 and the particle velocities @xmath23 along with the particle number densities @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the set of equations ( [ eq1])-([eq8 ] ) is overdetermined .",
    "the extra equation can be understood as a restriction on the boundary conditions . in specific cases ,",
    "the above set of equations may become degenerate .",

    "using equations ( [ eq9])-([eq10 ] ) in equations ( [ eq5])-([eq6 ] ) yields the force - free charge and current in the form @xmath49 with equations ( [ eq12])-([eq13 ] ) equation ( [ eq3 ] ) becomes degenerate : if its radial component is satisfied , the other two are valid identically .",
    "hence , equations ( [ eq2])-([eq3 ] ) are reduced to @xmath50 @xmath51 one can see that @xmath52 is the trivial solution of the set of equations ( [ eq14 ] ) , which allows any number densities of the particles .",
    "the non - trivial solution also exists , @xmath53 obviously , @xmath54 does not seem a proper choice , since then @xmath55 and the left - hand side of the equation of motion ( [ eq1 ] ) contains uncertainty .",
    "the particle distributions obeying equations ( [ eq12 ] ) , ( [ eq15 ] ) should also satisfy the continuity equation ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath56 where @xmath57 is independent of @xmath58 .",
    "according to the above consideration , if one of the radial velocity components , say @xmath59 , were known , one would immediately obtain the other one from equation ( [ eq16 ] ) and the corresponding number densities from equation ( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "generally speaking , the form of @xmath59 is not arbitrary .",
    "we suggest that the physically meaningful form corresponds to the low - mass limit of the complete two - fluid problem including the particle inertia . in sect .  3 , the equation of motion is solved in terms of series in @xmath25 in order to find the proper @xmath60 . before this",

    "the force - free approximation holds as long as the kinetic energy density of the plasma flow is less than the energy density of the magnetic field , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the plasma multiplicity factor ( i.e. the number of pairs per primary particle ) and @xmath71 is the goldreich - julian charge density .",
    "this can be rewritten in the form @xmath72 which allows direct comparison with the condition ( [ eq18 ] ) .",
    "given that @xmath73 , at the light cylinder the condition ( [ eq21 ] ) is stronger than the condition ( [ eq18 ] ) : even if the force - free approximation is already broken , the inertial effects are still insignificant .",
    "for typical pulsar parameters , the region of applicability of the force - free approximation stretches well beyond the light cylinder .",

    "3 , it appears impossible to construct the self - consistent two - fluid model in the absence of the first - order longitudinal electric field .",
    "it is the quantity that determines the difference of the zeroth - order particle velocities .",
    "hence , within the framework of our model , the force - free approximation bears imprints of the next - order particle acceleration in the longitudinal electric field .",
    "the corresponding finite parallel conductivity , @xmath170 , is expressed in terms of @xmath171 and seems to give a more realistic description of the acceleration processes in the pulsar magnetosphere as compared to the ad hoc conductivity of massless particles normally addressed in the literature .",
    "note that our model can naturally incorporate not only the linear acceleration of the particle species . with the quantity @xmath88 in hand",
    ", one would include the particle gyration as well .",
    "although both the linear acceleration and particle gyration are as small as @xmath172 and their contribution to the general force - free picture is minimal , they still may be responsible for the observed high - energy radiation , whose level is typically much less than the total energetic output of the pulsar .",
    "thus , our model seems a proper context to examine any type of radiation processes by the accelerated particles and to interpret the pulsar high - energy emission .",

    "although our consideration does not include the temperature effects and one can not conclude as to the development of the two - stream instability in this case , it should be noted that actually our consideration does not place any restriction on the value of the shift in the distributions of the particle species .",
    "the shift is solely determined by the details of particle acceleration in the longitudinal electric field .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the relation between the velocity shift and the accelerating electric field implies the physical connection between the resultant radio and high - energy emissions of pulsars . with the present state of art ,",
    "the concrete observational consequences are still obscure , but it is important that this connection is an inseparable constituent of the global magnetospheric structure of the pulsar .    in our model ,",
    "the particle motion is no longer radial .",
    "a slight curvature of the trajectories can be seen in fig .",
    "although the corresponding azimuthal velocity components are small , the resultant differential rotation of the particles may have important implications .",
    "in particular , this hints at the possibility of the diochotron instability which is regarded as a mechanism of the radio subpulse phenomenon . a general idea and some illustrative calculations for ad hoc distributions were given in @xcite .",
    "although our present consideration does not provide sufficient details , one can expect that as both @xmath23 and @xmath40 depend on @xmath173 , the proper distributions may really exist .",
    "as is evident from figs .",
    "[ f1 ] , [ f2 ] , @xmath171 change with distance from the magnetic axis .",
    "acceleration in the self - consistent fields occurs in such a way that at any point the electromagnetic force is compensated , the continuity condition is satisfied and the global charge and current are matched . at @xmath174 , a slight increase of the velocities is replaced by a drastic growth , in which case the low - mass approximation , @xmath106 , is ultimately broken .",
    "apparently , it is the place where the energy of the self - consistent fields is intensely transmitted to the particle flow . besides that",
    ", the closure of the global current circuit of a pulsar is also believed to occur there .",
    "thus , our simplified model still predetermines the main problems of pulsar electrodynamics , such as the @xmath13-problem and the current circuit configuration .",
    "it should be noted that in our consideration the equation of particle motion ( [ eq1 ] ) does not include the radiation reaction force .",
    "in contrast to other neglected effects , such as gravitation or collisions , the radiation damping is believed to be very strong , especially close to the neutron star surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a probe particle moving in an external magnetic field , this would result in almost immediate loss of the perpendicular momentum , making the particle slide along the magnetic field line , in which case the radiation reaction force is zero .",

    "\\label{eq40}\\ ] ] using equations ( [ eq9])-([eq12 ] ) in equation ( [ eq40 ] ) , one can see that in case of negligible inertia @xmath176 is exactly zero .",
    "furthermore , it does not contribute to the first - order equation of motion as well .",
    "strictly speaking , one should also take into account another term of @xmath177 , which is only @xmath178 less than @xmath176 .",
    "( recall that in our consideration @xmath82 is not a large parameter . ) according to @xcite , @xmath179\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq41}\\ ] ] it is evident that this term also does not contribute to the zeroth - order equation of motion .",
    "and it is not difficult to see that incorporating equation ( [ eq41 ] ) into the first - order equation of motion by no means changes the solvability condition ( [ eq24 ] ) , modifying only the definition of @xmath93 .",
    "thus , it is indeed reasonable to omit the radiation reaction force in our consideration .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the first- and higher - order components of the self - consistent electromagnetic fields are not obliged to supply particle motion along the trajectories dictated by the radiative damping , but the resultant gyration , being a higher - order effect , is beyond the framework of the present study .",
    "it is important to note that the situation becomes substantially distinct as soon as the particle inertia is not negligible , i.e. at @xmath174 . given that the inertial term is not small , the self - consistent electromagnetic fields change substantially , equation ( [ eq11 ] ) is no longer valid even approximately and @xmath180 are no longer cancelled .",
    "thus , the inertia of strongly accelerated particles causes such self - consistent electromagnetic fields that imply strong radiation losses .",
    "the particle trajectories are believed to be markedly modified , and the particle gyration is no longer a small effect .",
    "all this may contribute to both the current closure and energy transfer from the fields to the particles .    in summary",
    ", taking into account vanishingly small inertia of the particles has a number of interesting consequences .",
    "of course , the important restriction of our treatment is the assumption of a monopolar magnetic field , which is necessary for the transparent analytic treatment .",
    "however , our simplistic picture of the global magnetosphere of a pulsar still appears much more rich in physics than its preceding force - free analogues .",
    "[ s5 ]    we have considered the low - mass limit of the self - consistent two - fluid model for the magnetosphere of a monopolar structure . the solution obtained differs substantially from the well - known force - free picture , where the particles move radially at a speed of light . now",
    "the number densities of the two particle species are definite , the velocities are distinct , both being less than the speed of light , and the particle trajectories demonstrate a slight curvature .",
    "the shift in the particle velocities is determined by the first - order longitudinal electric field , which appears the necessary ingredient of the self - consistent two - fluid model .",
    "hence , the parallel conductivity of the plasma is @xmath8 , as opposed to the customary conductivity of massless particles considered in the literature .",
    "our model incorporates the parallel acceleration of the particles , whose kinetic energy density is much less than the energy density of the magnetic field . besides that , it allows to include particle gyration . therefore it is believed to be a proper context to include the radiative processes into the global magnetosphere and to interpret the pulsar high - energy emission .",
    "our results may also have weighty implications for the pulsar radio emission .",
    "difference in the velocities of the particle species may result in the two - stream instability which may give rise to the plasma waves convertible to the observed radio emission .",
    "the relation between the velocity shift and the longitudinal electric field is expected to underlie the connection between the radio and high - energy emissions of pulsars . within the framework of our model ,",
    "the particles perform differential rotation , which may cause the diochotron instability and be responsible for the radio subpulse phenomenon in pulsars .    apart from acceleration in the first - order longitudinal electric field , the particle velocities change due to the spatial dependence of the zeroth - order self - consistent electromagnetic fields . as a result ,",
    "@xmath81 increase with distance to the magnetic axis . at @xmath174 , a slight growth switches to a drastic one , so that the particle lorentz - factors increase intensely and the low - mass limit , @xmath106 , is ultimately broken .",
    "apparently , the locus @xmath174 is the place where most part of the magnetic field energy is transmitted to the particles .",
    "one can expect that the closure of the global current circuit of a pulsar also occurs there .",
    "of course , a stringent treatment of these issues , which are the basic problems of pulsar electrodynamics , is beyond the scope of our simplistic model .    on the whole",
    ", the self - consistent two - fluid model seems a promising description of the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the above considered low - mass limit for the monopolar magnetic field can be regarded as a starting point for analytic and numerical studies of the realistic magnetosphere , including not only its global structure , energy transport and current circuit configuration , but also the radiative processes , pair creation , etc .",
