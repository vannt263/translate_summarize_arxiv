    "the central role of the @xmath0 scattering in the theory of strong interactions is steming from its remarkable properties which might be briefly collected into the following list :    \\1 .",
    "pions are the lightest hadronic states ; unitarity provides that only the elastic @xmath2 cut is important at low energies .",
    "pions are spinless particles : the amplitude assumes the simplest form .",
    "the isospin symmetry restricts the amplitudes of various physical processes to only 3 independent combinations since the two  pion state might have only three values of the fixed isospin @xmath3 .",
    "this reaction provides an example of the perfect crossing symmetry .",
    "the three isospin amplitudes are still not independent in the functional sense .",
    "statistics of pions considered as identical particles and crossing relations for amplitudes of cross channels allow to express any two amplitudes in terms of the rest one .",
    "the interpretation of the pion as the goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of qcd provided a new argumentation for the importance of the pion  pion interactions in the hadron physics and nuclear phenomena at low energies .",
    "the few listed properties explain why this reaction for a long time serves as a test field for various methods of the quantum field theory such as dispersion relations , the @xmath4matrix approach , etc .",
    "the advantages and achievements of various theoretical approaches are summarized in the review books @xcite  we advise reader to look there for more details if necessary ; the modern point of view on pion  pion and pion  hadron interactions might be found in the book @xcite and details of chpt approach  in the review papers @xcite ; a summary of the most interesting theoretical predictions as well as of the forthcoming experimental tests might be found in the talk @xcite .",
    "the recent results @xcite of the so called generalized chpt approach @xcite and the progress in the two  loop chpt calculations @xcite are claiming for more precise experimental information on the @xmath2 interaction at low energies at the @xmath5 order which obviously must be presented in the model  independent form .",
    "since it is not possible experimentally to create the pionic target or the colliding pion beams there are only indirect ways for obtaining experimental data on the @xmath0 scattering .",
    "the reactions @xmath6 and @xmath7 are considered as the most important sources of an ( indirect ) information . at the same time",

    "state interaction of pions which are common to the description of @xmath6 and @xmath7 reactions .",
    "therefore an unambiguous parametrization of the @xmath9 amplitude ( @xmath10 vertex ) is required for the low energy region .    in principle , the parameters of phase shifts or the scattering lengths and the slopes of partial waves are the most acceptable physical parameters .",
    "however , the partial wave decomposition can not respect the crossing properties in a simple way .",
    "the technique of roy equations @xcite based on dispersion relations can restrict the parameters and make the amplitude ( which is defined in terms of partial waves ) consistent with conditions of bose  statistics and crossing .",

    "the analysis of data on processes like @xmath6 , @xmath8 where the amplitude of @xmath9 scattering must be considered in the presence of contributions of a variety of concurrent processes puts further restrictions on the desired parametrization of the @xmath10 vertex .",
    "since the analyzed amplitude comes with a large number of free parameters the fitting of experimental data becomes possible only under the condition that the phase  space integration might be factored out from parameters .",
    "this is possible only if free ( and formal ) parameters enter the amplitude polynomially and the relations for formal parameters do not contain kinematics ; otherwise the huge number of the 9dimensional integration runs would be inevitable for all experimental points during the every step of fitting iterations .",
    "the condition rules out the phase shift parameters as well as the next  to  leading order ansatz of chpt for the @xmath10 vertex .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to elaborate the near  threshold expansion of the @xmath11 amplitude which along with the isospin invariance satisfies the exact combined bose and crossing symmetries and the approximate ( perturbative ) unitarity .",
    "our approach is based on the crossing covariant variables which were introduced in the paper @xcite and proved to be an efficient tool for the off  mass  shell parametrization of the considered amplitude , in particular , when being applied to the @xmath6 reaction @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we use combinations of parameters describing the deviation from the threshold in the crossing  invariant way . in their terms the real part of the amplitude is uniformly expanded in the vicinities of the thresholds of all physical channels simultaneously .",

    "being expressed via subsidiary parameters @xmath189 and , finally , via scattering lengths and slopes these two vanishing coefficients provide two infinite sets of conditions for the low energy characteristics of the @xmath11 amplitude .    in the present work",
    "we do not plan to discuss in more details the arising conditions .",
    "we only would like to state that the conditions definitely differ from roy equations @xcite since only the threshold characteristics are being involved .",

    "this results in the different counting scheme which , for example , at @xmath5 leaves in effect only the following parameters of the considered approximation : @xmath216 since no dynamics was used in the above pure kinematical considerations the actual scheme might be even more constrained .",

    "the neglect of such a parameter , if at all possible without prescribing definite value for a lower one , causes the appearance of higher terms in the expansion ( [ anu ] ) for the compensation .",

    "the isoscalar amplitudes in the same domain as well as any amplitude of a specific process are then simply determined by inverting the relations ( [ fxdi ] ) .",
    "this completes the construction of the phenomenological @xmath11 amplitude suitable for the analysis of experimental data in the low energy region .",

    "the expansion which we elaborated contains an equivalent of the threshold characteristics ( scattering lengths and slopes ) in an explicitly crossing covariant terms and it is valid for the threshold regions of all 3 cross channels ( @xmath144 ) simultaneously .",
    "the advantage of the approach might be clearly displayed by a comparison with the analysis by roskies @xcite which is based on the ordinary mandelstam variables @xmath26 and is valid for the central point @xmath231 .",
    "the sophisticated solution of the crossing restrictions in mandelstam variables is given there in terms of the orthogonal polynomials over the central triangle of the mandelstam plane @xcite .",
    "the origin of the difference stems from the fact that in terms of the ordinary variables it is possible to construct only one crossing  invariant amplitude ( namely , @xmath232 ) .",
    "unfortunately , because of large errors of the existing data on the low energy @xmath11 scattering now it is not possible to fix with the satisfactory precision the model  independent phenomenological parameters of our amplitude ( [ reabc ] ) , ( [ anu ] ) .",
    "for example , only four parameters are sufficient to fit ( with @xmath233 ) the data on scattering lengths and slopes of the compilation @xcite providing ( in the pion ",
    "mass units ) @xmath234    thus it is instructive to compare directly the theoretical amplitudes themselves , namely , the chpt one  loop amplitude @xmath235 of the papers @xcite with that given by eqs .",

    "the lorentz invariance of expressions determining the amplitude in terms of the independent parameters ( in contrast to the explicit reference  frame dependence of the standard set in the definition ( [ retl ] ) which complicates the application to processes like @xmath6 , @xmath8 where the cmf of the dipion system does not coincide with the cmf of the reaction and , moreover , is `` moving '' from point to point of the phase space ) .        therefore , the presented phenomenological @xmath9 amplitude is suitable for the analysis of the @xmath7 decay and the @xmath6 reaction from the threshold @xmath240mev / c up to @xmath241mev / c since the energy region @xmath242 is statistically insignificant or unreachable in the above conditions .",
