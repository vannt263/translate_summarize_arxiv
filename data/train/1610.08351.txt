    "photonic crystal ( phc ) @xcite cavities are of tremendous interest for device applications due to their beneficial properties such as small mode volume and high quality factor ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "multiple - cavity systems are great platforms to study fundamental physics and build all - optical devices @xcite .",
    "thus , the characterization of multiple - cavity systems composed of photonic crystal cavities is of great importance .",
    "reflection measurement is a typical way of characterizing resonant systems .",
    "the geometry of the direct - coupled system we use is shown in fig .",
    "1 . from a reflection spectrum , the resonance width and frequency can be obtained . for a resonant system ,",
    "the line shape is generally described by a lorentzian function that is perfectly symmetric .",
    "thus , a set of lorentzian dips is expected to be observed in the reflection spectrum for a directly coupled waveguide - cavities system . however , in reality a set of asymmetric line shapes are usually observed .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "2 . the asymmetric line shape originates from fano interference @xcite . when a narrower resonance interferes with a continuum , sharp asymmetric fano resonances are observed @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the fano line shape is preferred to the lorenztian shape .",
    "for example , for optical switching fano resonances reduce the switching thresholds and give much larger switching contrast @xcite .",
    "fano resonances appear very often and are widely studied in side - coupled single and multi - cavity and waveguide systems . for side - coupled single cavity and waveguide systems ,",
    "fano resonances can be created by adding extra scattering or reflecting elements in waveguides since transmission is open within the bandwidth of the waveguides @xcite . for side - coupled multi - cavity and waveguide system ,",
    "fano resonances show up naturally due to the direct and indirect cavity - cavity couplings even without extra scattering and reflecting elements@xcite .",
    "situations are different in direct - coupled single and multi - cavity and waveguide systems . in such systems transmission",
    "is only open at the cavity resonance , and indirect cavity - cavity couplings are absent .",
    "therefore , the additional channel that gives rise to fano resonances needs to be identified .",
    "therefore , the observed fano resonances in our experiment are not trivial , and its physical cause of them needs to be uncovered .",
    "tuning the asymmetry of the fano line shape also arouses much interest , and it can be done by tuning the cavity resonances @xcite . for a given cavity , by deliberate design of the coupling to the continuum , different fano line shapes can be obtained by fabricating different samples @xcite .",
    "however , after the structure is fabricated , it is very difficult to change the fano line shape without changing the frequency of the resonance because this requires to change the properties of the continuum or the broad resonances especially in single mode waveguides .",
    ", the shifts of the red and blue holes are 2/3 @xmath1 and 1/3 @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is the lattice constant . the red cone next to the sample represents a polarization maintaining lensed fiber ( pmf ) used to couple light into the membrane . ]    in this work , we experimentally and theoretically investigate fano resonances in a directly coupled waveguide and multiple - cavity system in a phc membrane structure .",
    "we measure the fano lines and manipulate their shape by tuning the resonances .",
    "we create an analytical model which uncovers the origin of the fano shape , and it accurately reproduces our experimental results . with the help of our model , we propose and experimentally demonstrate a way of directly manipulating the fano lineshape without tuning the cavity resonances .",
    "the schematic of the system we consider is shown in fig .",
    "3 . unlike the typical scheme for directly coupled waveguide - systems",
    ", we include here the lensed fiber used to couple light into the waveguide .",
    "light propagation in this system can be separated into three processes .",
    "the first process is the light coupling between the lensed fiber and the input waveguide .",
    "the second process is the light transport in the input waveguide .",
    "the last process is the light coupling between the waveguides and cavities .",
    "we use transfer matrices to model all these processes .",
    "the transfer matrix @xcite connects the fields of forward and backward propagating waves from the left side to the right side , @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the forward ( backward ) propagating wave on the right side , @xmath5 is the forward ( backward ) propagating wave on the left side and @xmath6 is the transfer matrix that links them .      in the process of coupling between the measurement device ( lensed fiber ) and the waveguide , there are a few physical events we have to consider .",
    "the first is the reflection at the boundaries between the lensed fiber and air , and between air and the facet of the input waveguide .",
    "the second is the coupling loss .",
    "the third is the light propagation in air .",
    "reflection at the boundaries can be modeled as reflection from partially reflecting mirrors .",
    "the transfer matrix of a partially reflecting mirror has the form as @xcite , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the amplitude reflection coefficient . in the model here for simplicity , we assume it is the same for both boundaries .    the propagation of light in the air gap is modeled as , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the length of the air gap .",
    "the corresponding physical process of the coupling loss can be modeled as , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the power loss in the coupling process .",
    "the matrix that describes process i is the multiplication of the matrices discussed above , it is @xmath13      the propagation in the photonic crystal waveguide has the same form as eq .",
    "however , the dispersion of the waveguide has to be considered .",
    "the matrix is @xmath14 where the dispersive quantity @xmath15 is the bloch wave vector of the wave in the waveguide and @xmath16 is the length of waveguide @xmath17 .",
    "it is known that close to the band edge , the dispersion of the photonic crystal can be expressed as @xmath18 @xcite , where @xmath19 is the frequency of the waveguide mode , @xmath20 is the frequency of the band edge of the waveguide mode , and @xmath21 is the effective photon mass close to the band edge . as a result , we can express the bloch wave vector @xmath22 as @xmath23 .      to derive the matrix which describes the light coupling between the waveguides and cavities",

    "the matrix that describes all the processes is @xmath43 . in our experiment",
    "the value of @xmath25 is small enough to assume that all the elements after the output waveguide decouple from the system and do not influence the reflection spectrum .",

    "the other one is the barrier waveguide , the width of it is @xmath47 . in the barrier waveguide , there are three mode - gap cavities @xcite .",
    "they are created by shifting the holes around the barrier waveguide ( fig .",
    "an output waveguide which is in line with the input waveguide is also in the structure .",
    "however , it is placed further away from the third cavity . a polarization maintaining lensed fiber ( red cone in fig .",
    "1 ) with numerical aperture ( na ) 0.55 is used to couple light from a tunable continuous wave ( cw ) infrared ( ir ) laser to the sample .",
    "a fiber circulator is used to connect the lensed fiber and laser .",

    "the second fano resonance is between 1543.5 nm and 1544 nm , it has a sharp asymmetric line shape .",
    "the peak intensity of this resonance is twice smaller than the maximum intensity of the background fringes .",
    "the third resonance ( fig .",
    "4(c ) ) between 1541.95 nm and 1542.10 nm is less pronounced .        in order to cancel the disorder of the cavities",
    "@xcite , we use a cw diode laser ( @xmath48 nm ) to tune the frequencies of the cavities in the sample by laser induced heating @xcite . to control the first and third cavity simultaneously ,",
    "two foci are projected on the surface of the sample by an objective with na 0.4 .",
    "these foci are generated with the help of a reflective spatial light modulator ( slm ) in the pump path .",
    "a digital holographic phase pattern is written on the slm for the generation of the foci @xcite .    when the laser spots are focused on the cavities ,",
    "their resonances are tuned to the red .",
    "although there is no direct laser light on the second cavity , the resonance of cavity 2 also shifts due to heat diffusion .",
    "the reflection spectrum of the tuned device is shown in fig .",
    "the power of the spots on cavity 1 and cavity 3 is 9 @xmath49w and 108 @xmath49w respectively .",
    "we see that in fig .",
    "5(a ) the three resonances occur within 1 nm in the spectrum .",
    "one is with sharp asymmetric line shape .",
    "the other two have less asymmetric line shape and form two deep valleys in the spectrum .",
    "the modulation of the fano dip shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) is due to the slm noise .",
    "the analysis of the reflection spectra is done by fitting experimental results with our model .",

    "4 . the fit agrees very well with our data for resonances 1 , 2 and the background fringes .",
    "it accurately characterizes the period and visibility of the fringes .",
    "meanwhile , it describes the line shapes , widths , heights of the peaks and depths of the trough for resonances 1 and 2 .",
    "however , we can not correctly reproduce the depth and width of resonance 3 at the same time .",
    "the probable cause for this is a direct coupling term between the waveguide and cavities 2 and 3 , or a second neighboring coupling between the cavities .",
    "such terms have been ignored in our model as they would lead to an excessive number of free parameters .",
    "the fit of our model to the tuned reflection spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "we see that for all three resonances the fit agrees very well with experimental data .",
    "there are slight deviations on wings of the resonances between the fit and experimental data .",
    "these wings are mostly determined by the fabry - prot fringes . to characterize them accurately , the accurate knowledge of the curvature of the phc waveguide band is needed . in our model",
    ", we only use two parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 to describe the band .",
    "this is an approximation only valid for a narrow frequency band .",
    "the values are obtained by fitting from the reference spectrum shown in fig 4(a ) .",
    "thus , the small deviation shown in the tuned spectrum which is in a different wavelength range is reasonable .",
    "the fact that the fit from our model has an excellent agreement with the experiment shows that our model describes the physical process of the system accurately .",
    "it not only explains the physical origin of the observed fano resonances but also provides the key parameters of the sample such as the intrinsic loss rates of the cavities .",
    "the fitting results show that the intrinsic @xmath0 factor is larger than @xmath92 .",
    "the fitting results show that after we apply the tuning , we achieve to reduce the frequency detuning between cavity 1 and 2 smaller than their inter coupling rate , the same holds for cavities 2 and 3 .",
    "we can describe the lensed fiber , air gap , input waveguide and the cavities together as a special fabry - prot cavity . if we ignore the reflection from the facet of the input waveguide , the first",
    " mirror \" of this fabry - prot cavity is the tip of the lensed fiber , the second  mirror \" of this cavity is the system of photonic crystal cavities .",
    "the length of the cavity is the total length of the air gap together with the input waveguide .",
    "the phase shift of a single round trip of this fabry - prot cavity consists of two parts , the first is the phase shift from propagation and the second is the phase shift due to the reflection from the second  mirror \" .",
    "the specialty of the second  mirror \" is that it is very dispersive around the cavity frequencies .",
    "the fano line shape is determined by the phase shift of the round trip .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the fano lineshape of the resonance can be tuned by changing the length of the air gap .",
    "we perform an experiment to test this prediction on a new sample with the same parameters as our previous sample . due to the inevitable disorder ,",
    "the resonance positions of the cavities appear at different wavelengths .",
    "we measure reflection spectra with different sizes of the air gap .",
    "this was done by moving the sample step by step away from the lensed fiber with our precise translation stage .",
    "the measured reflection spectra are shown in fig .",
    "6 . in fig .",
    "6(a ) , the reference spectrum is presented ( the reference distance between the lensed fiber and sample is denoted by @xmath10 and is the distance where the coupling is optimized ) , and we see a fano resonance is in the form of a dip with a bit asymmetry . after the reference measurement , we increase the length of the air gap with a step size of 100 nm .",
    "the spectra with air gap sizes @xmath93 nm , @xmath94 nm and @xmath95 nm are shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) , fig . 6(c ) and fig .",
    "6(d ) respectively . in fig .",
    "6(b ) , we see a sharp asymmetric fano resonance with a peak at short wavelength and a dip at a longer wavelength . in complete contrast to the reference spectrum , we see a peak with a slight asymmetry instead of a dip in fig",
    ". 6(c ) . in fig .",
    "6(d ) , we again see a sharp asymmetric fano resonance , however , it is almost a flipped version of fig .",
    "it has a dip at a short wavelength and peak at a longer wavelength .",
    "we also retrieve the q parameter that describes the asymmetry of fano lines using the fano line formula @xcite .",
    "we also plot the fits from our analytical model . in the fitting ,",
    "all the parameters are kept the same for the results from fig .",
    "6(a ) to fig .",
    "6(d ) except the coupling loss , since it increases as we increase the size of the air gap . for the size of the air gap",
    ", we gradually change its value according to what shown in fig .",
    "the fits agree well with our experiment , and it confirms that changing the air gap size is the cause of the big change of the fano line shape .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "6 confirm our prediction that the shape of a fano resonance can be tuned by changing the size of the air gap between the sample and lensed fiber , and demonstrate that the origin of the fano line shape is indeed the interference of the sharp resonances with the broad resonances defined by the reflection of the lensed fiber and coupling loss .",
    "in summary , fano resonances in the reflection spectra of a direct - coupled waveguide - cavities system in a photonic crystal membrane structure have been experimentally and theoretically investigated .",
    "our theoretical model has an excellent agreement with our experimental results and provides important information on the very low bare loss rate of the cavities .",
    "the origin of the fano lineshape is the interference between the wave reflected from the lensed fiber and the wave reflected from the photonic crystal cavities .",
    "the path length difference between these waves is a round trip of the air gap size and the input waveguide .",
    "we propose and experimentally show that the fano asymmetric parameter can be simply tuned by changing the air gap size between the sample and the fiber .",
    "our model can be used to investigate other physical processes in the system , such as the dynamical tuning of the fano asymmetry by ultra - fast switching @xcite .",
