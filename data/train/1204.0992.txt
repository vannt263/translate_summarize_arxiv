    "this paper and in a sequel @xcite we consider the problem of interpolating all values of a discrete , periodic signal @xmath6 , @xmath7 , when @xmath2 values of @xmath0 are known .",
    "one solution is a discrete form of the classical nyquist - shannon theorem , where the spectrum of the signal is assumed to vanish outside a contiguous band of frequencies ; see @xcite , for example . at the other extreme is the new and important area of compressed sensing , where no assumptions on the spectrum are made . for this , of the many papers we mention only @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , since we will refer to this work later .",
    "our approach to the problem is in between , though we begin by formulating a very general definition .",
    "[ def : interpolating - system ] let @xmath8 be a @xmath9-dimensional subspace of @xmath10 , let @xmath11 $ ] be an index set of size @xmath9 , and let @xmath12 be a set of @xmath9 vectors in @xmath8 .",
    "we say that @xmath13 is an _ interpolating system _ if each @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 we call @xmath5 a _ sampling set _ and @xmath16 an _ interpolating basis_. when we refer simply to a sampling set we always mean that it is associated with an interpolating basis .",
    "if the vectors @xmath17 are orthogonal we say that @xmath13 is an _ orthogonal interpolating system _ and that @xmath16 is an _ orthogonal interpolating basis_.    the point of the definition is that the interpolation of all values of @xmath0 uses the sampled values @xmath18 , @xmath19 , which might be thought of as measurements of @xmath0 with respect to the fixed , natural basis of the ambient space @xmath10 , while the basis @xmath16 is tailored to @xmath8 and @xmath5 . to be a subspace of any finite - dimensional vector space @xmath20 , and sample @xmath14 with respect to any fixed basis of @xmath20 , but the present definition suffices . ]",
    "note that @xmath5 need not consist of uniformly spaced indices , so the sampling may be irregular .",
    "indeed , the results described here and in @xcite were originally motivated by questions from colleagues in medical imaging who had observed that irregular sampling patterns could often give excellent results with less computation .    for us , to solve the interpolation problem for @xmath8 is to find an interpolating system .",
    "it is a linear theory in all aspects .",
    "every subspace has an interpolating system , though it may not be unique , but not every subspace has an orthogonal interpolating system . for a given subspace it is also not true that any index set is a sampling set for some interpolating basis , so the intervals between samples are not arbitrary .",
    "the only subspaces that have _ orthonormal _ interpolating systems are the coordinate subspaces .",
    "all of this is discussed in section [ section : general - properties ] .",
    "orthogonal interpolating systems are the subject of @xcite , and we find interesting connections with difference sets , perfect graphs , tiling , and we answer affirmatively a discrete version of a conjecture of fuglede .    in section [ section : general - properties ]",
    "we provide some basic results on interpolating systems in general .",
    "we quickly move , in section [ section : bandlimited ] , to study bandlimited spaces , @xmath4 , defined as signals whose discrete fourier transforms are supported on @xmath3 .",
    "we do not require that @xmath3 be a set of contiguous indices , so this is more general than the situation in the discrete nyquist - shannon theorem ( though we continue to use the term  bandlimited \" for short ) .    in section [ section : universal ] we begin to concentrate on universal sampling sets , namely index sets @xmath5 that are sampling sets for _ any _ bandlimited space @xmath4 with @xmath21 .",
    "that is , @xmath5 is universal if the sampling pattern specified by @xmath5 can be used for interpolation of signals from any @xmath4 .",
    "universal sampling sets were used in @xcite for multicoset sampling and in @xcite in connection with compressed sensing . here our central result gives several necessary and sufficient conditions for an index set to be universal when @xmath1 is a prime power .",
    "a mathematical consequence of our result is a generalization of chebotarev s theorem on the invertibility of submatrices of the fourier matrix .    in section [ section :",
    "maximal ] we show that a universal sampling set has an interesting structure as a disjoint union of what we call elementary universal sets , and through this analysis we are able to count the number of universal sampling sets of a given size .",
    "we also introduce maximal ( and minimal ) universal sampling sets which in turn enter naturally into the uncertainty principles that we discuss in section [ section : uncertainty ] . as an application of uncertainty and universality we prove a `` random '' uncertainty principle , and deduce a generalization of the cauchy - davenport theorem from additive number theory .",
    "our debt to the work in @xcite and @xcite is clear .",
    "many of our results assume that @xmath1 is a prime power , and naturally we wonder whether this can be generalized .",
    "the definitions we introduce and the methods we use are based primarily on properties of index sets when the elements are reduced modulo powers of a prime . with a few exceptions ( e.g. , minimal and cyclotomic polynomials ) these can be considered elementary , and",
    "it is surprising ( to us ) how far they lead .",
    "the methods here also seem rather different from those of compressed sensing . in compressed sensing , which is nonlinear in theory and practice , the recovery of a signal from samples",
    "does not require knowledge of the frequency spectrum , whereas linear theories like ours can not do without knowledge of the spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , with universality the sampling patterns in our approach do not depend on the frequencies , the reconstruction of a signal from its samples is by linear operations , and the samples are `` samples '' in the classical sense instead of random projections of the signal onto a measurement basis as is done in compressed sensing .",
    "both approaches start with discrete signals , but one needs to sample an analog signal in the first place and this analog sampling generally needs some knowledge of the frequency spectrum .",
    "works such as @xcite and @xcite confront this issue through  spectrum blind \" sampling , and they end up needing the idea of universality in the process .",
    "it is also interesting that the linear theory here can be used to prove a random uncertainty principle without the necessity of nonlinear techniques , though our result is not as strong as the result in @xcite .",
    "we hope to pursue the connections and differences further .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for additional results , discussion , and examples .",
    "see also appendix [ section : additional - references ] for references to papers on universality for continuous - time signals .",
    "this section is a summary of elementary properties of interpolating systems , including existence theorems in both an algebraic and geometric formulation .",
    "the ideas are simple enough , but they fit together nicely and are an essential foundation for the less simple work to follow .",
    "we fix some notation . without further comment",
    "we will identify a vector in @xmath10 with its @xmath1-periodic extension and vice versa , and we typically index vectors from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "( we assume periodicity because the discrete fourier transform will soon enter the picture . ) for @xmath24 $ ] we let @xmath25 be the ( periodized ) discrete @xmath26-function shifted to @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 is the natural basis of @xmath10 .",
    "the components of a vector in @xmath10 will always be in terms of the natural basis , but any fixed basis of @xmath10 would do for the following development . if @xmath29 $ ] we let @xmath30    our first goal is to establish    [ theorem : existence ] any subspace @xmath8 of @xmath10 has an interpolating system .",
    "we will give two proofs , one geometric and one algebraic , and both are straightforward .",
    "in the following , @xmath8 is always a subspace of dimension @xmath9 and @xmath5 is always an index set of size @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath31\\setminus { \\mathcal{i}}$ ] .",
    "we record several facts .    an interpolating basis for a subspace @xmath8 is trying to be the natural basis in the slots specified by the index set .",
    "in fact this is a characterization of interpolating bases .    [",
    "proposition : characterization ] ( i ) a basis @xmath32 for @xmath8 is an interpolating basis if and only if @xmath33",
    "\\(ii ) any natural basis vector @xmath34 lying in @xmath8 is an element of any interpolating basis of @xmath8 .",
    "\\(iii ) an interpolating basis is determined by its index set , more precisely , if @xmath35 and @xmath36 are interpolating bases for @xmath8 then @xmath37 . for all @xmath38    expanding on the first point in proposition [ proposition : characterization ] , the elements of an interpolating basis are perturbations of the natural basis vectors by vectors outside @xmath8 :    [ proposition : perturbation ] ( i ) any interpolating basis @xmath39 of @xmath8 is of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 . if @xmath42 then @xmath43 .",
    "\\(ii ) the subspaces of @xmath10 having an orthogonal interpolating system are of the form @xmath44 where the nonzero @xmath45 are orthogonal vectors in @xmath46 .",
    "we omit the proofs of propositions [ proposition : characterization ] and [ proposition : perturbation ] . part ( ii ) of proposition [",
    "proposition : perturbation ] can be applied in the negative to find examples of subspaces that do not have an orthogonal interpolating basis ",
    "this is a much larger topic  and it also follows from part ( ii ) that the only subspaces having an orthonormal interpolating basis are the coordinate subspaces . both of these points were raised in the introduction .",
    "it is easy to see that there is an index set @xmath3 of size @xmath47 such that @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 be the projection of @xmath10 onto @xmath8 along @xmath50 . if @xmath14 then , on the one hand , @xmath51 on the other hand , since @xmath52 and @xmath53 we have @xmath54 thus the @xmath55 form an interpolating basis of @xmath8 indexed by @xmath56\\setminus { \\mathcal{j}}$ ] .",
    "we see from this why an interpolating basis need not be unique .",
    "the ambiguity in choosing an interpolating basis arises from the ambiguity in choosing a complement ; if there is not a unique choice of the complement @xmath50 of @xmath8 , and generally there is not , then there is not a unique interpolating basis for @xmath8 .",
    "however , the existence of an interpolating basis _ produces _ a complement to @xmath8 :    let @xmath57 be an interpolating basis of @xmath8",
    ". then @xmath58 .",
    "if we show that @xmath59 then @xmath60 forms a basis for @xmath10 . for this , let @xmath61 . then @xmath62",
    "because @xmath63 is an interpolating basis for @xmath8 , and also @xmath64 thus @xmath65 let @xmath66 and evaluate both sides at @xmath67 : @xmath68 by , @xmath69 and we are done .",
    "the algebraic proof of theorem [ theorem : existence ] is in terms of matrices .",
    "associate with an index set @xmath70 the @xmath71 matrix @xmath72 whose @xmath9 columns are the basis vectors @xmath73 , @xmath74 ,  , @xmath75 . if @xmath76 is an a @xmath77 matrix then @xmath78 is @xmath79 submatrix of @xmath76 obtained by choosing the rows indexed by @xmath5 . in particular , operating by @xmath80 on an @xmath1-vector @xmath0 produces the @xmath9-vector with components @xmath81 , @xmath82 ,  , @xmath83 .",
    "if @xmath76 is an @xmath84 matrix then @xmath85 is the @xmath86 submatrix of @xmath76 obtained by choosing the columns indexed by @xmath5 .",

    "@xmath96 is an @xmath97 matrix and we see that @xmath63 is an interpolating basis for @xmath8 with sampling set @xmath5 if and only if @xmath98 .",
    "now we have    take any basis @xmath99 of @xmath8 and let @xmath76 be the @xmath71 matrix whose columns are the basis vectors @xmath100 ; thus @xmath101 . since @xmath76 has rank @xmath9 it has a @xmath89 invertible submatrix , and possibly many such submatrices",
    "let @xmath5 be the index set corresponding to the @xmath9 rows chosen from @xmath76 to form the invertible submatrix @xmath102 .",
    "the columns of the @xmath103 matrix @xmath104 are again a basis of @xmath8 . we write them as @xmath105 , @xmath106 ,  , @xmath107 , indexed by @xmath5 .",

    "this proof shows how to produce an interpolating basis provided one can find a @xmath89 invertible submatrix @xmath102 , indexed by @xmath5 . the more such submatrices the more interpolating bases for @xmath8 . on the opposite side ,",
    "in general not every index set @xmath5 is sampling set for an interpolating basis since , in general , not every choice of a @xmath110 submatrix is invertible .",
    "a slightly different way of arranging the algebraic proof also gives an interpolation formula , making more explicit .",
    "as above , let @xmath99 be a basis of @xmath111 and let @xmath76 be the corresponding @xmath71 matrix . if @xmath112 then @xmath113 for some constants",
