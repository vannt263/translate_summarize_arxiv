    "over the last three years , the combination of color selection from deep imaging surveys with spectroscopy from large aperture telescopes has revealed an abundant population of star - forming galaxies in the high redshift universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the remarkably rapid growth in surveys of these `` lyman - break '' galaxies has created an essentially new observational field : the study of galaxy clustering at @xmath7 .",
    "the first step on this path was the discovery by steidel et al .",
    "( 1998a ; hereafter sadgpk ) of a sharp spike in the redshift distribution of lyman - break galaxies in a @xmath8 field , implying that this galaxy population was already quite strongly clustered at @xmath6 .",
    "more recently giavalisco et al .",
    "( 1998a ) have used the angular correlation function and the estimated redshift distribution of a lyman - break galaxy sample to infer the spatial correlation function , obtaining a correlation length @xmath9 ( comoving , for @xmath1 ; @xmath10 ) .",
    "adelberger et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter asgdpk ) have studied the variance of cell counts in a redshift survey of six @xmath11 fields and estimate a somewhat larger correlation length , @xmath12 ( again for @xmath1 ) .",
    "other attempts to measure the galaxy correlation function at high redshift include studies of angular clustering in the hubble deep field ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and analyses of 3-dimensional clustering of civ absorption features in quasar spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "rapid observational progress begets theoretical interpretations , and there have been numerous papers offering predictions of lyman - break galaxy clustering in different cosmological models .",
    "nearly all of these papers in practice calculate the clustering of dark matter halos , using either n - body simulations or the approximate analytic methods developed by mo & white ( 1996 ) and kaiser ( 1984 ) .",
    "the n - body calculations ( @xciteb ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and analytic studies ( @xcite ; asgdpk ; @xcite ; @xcite ; sadgpk ) agree on an essential qualitative conclusion : if the lyman - break galaxies in current samples trace the massive tail of the halo population at @xmath13 , then they are expected to be highly biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution , as implied by the observed clustering strength .",
    "for this reason , models based on inflation and cdm can account reasonably well for the present clustering data with a variety of choices of cosmological parameters .",
    "asgdpk turn this argument around to conclude that the most luminous lyman - break galaxies must reside in massive halos because if they were low mass systems in more common halos  boosted to high rest - frame uv luminosity by bursts of star formation  then they would not exhibit the observed strong clustering .",
    "all of these interpretations rest on the assumption that one can , at least for purposes of clustering calculations , make a one - to - one identification between the population of lyman - break galaxies and the population of dark matter halos at @xmath14 .",
    "the analogous assumption at @xmath15 is known to be incorrect : typical virialized halos today represent the common envelopes of galaxy groups or clusters , and predictions of the galaxy correlation function from cdm n - body simulations are sensitive to the way one chooses to populate these halos with galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the one - to - one assumption may seem more plausible at @xmath14 when the individual high mass halos have masses that are typical of individual galaxy halos today , but the galaxies themselves may be smaller at high redshift , and one might equally well imagine that the relation between massive halos and galaxy groups is a scaled down version of the one that exists at @xmath15 . in a hydrodynamic simulation study of the population of damped ly@xmath16 absorbers , gardner et al .",
    "( 1997 , figure 1 ) explicitly demonstrate that many dark halos identified at @xmath6 with density contrast @xmath17 contain more than one galaxy .",
    "governato et al .  (",
    "1998 ) have taken a somewhat different approach to predict the clustering of lyman - break galaxies .",
    "they use a high resolution n - body simulation to model the formation and clustering of halos , but they use the semi - analytic galaxy formation prescriptions of cole et al .  ( 1994 ) and baugh et al .  ( 1998 ) to populate these halos with galaxies ( a similar approach has been taken by kauffmann et al .",
    "this technique substitutes an approximate description of gas cooling , star formation , and galaxy merging for the one - halo - one - galaxy assumption . in principle , this approach could yield significantly different clustering predictions , although the qualitative conclusion of governato et al .",
    "( 1998 )  that the presently detected population of lyman - break galaxies should be a highly biased tracer of structure  is similar to that of the papers cited earlier ( and we will reach essentially the same conclusion here ) .    in this paper , we extend our earlier studies of galaxy clustering in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter kwh ) to an investigation of high redshift galaxy clustering in five variants of the cdm scenario ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "two of the simulations ( the scdm and ccdm models described below ) are the ones analyzed in kwh and weinberg , hernquist , & katz ( 1997 , hereafter whk ) , but we did not present galaxy correlation functions in those papers because even that short time ago it seemed that the clustering of @xmath6 galaxies would not be accessible to observation for many years .",
    "the advantage of full hydrodynamic simulations over the semi - analytic galaxy formation method is that the crucial processes of dissipation and merging are treated much more realistically , without the idealizing approximations of spherical symmetry , isothermal profiles , and parameterized merging rates .",
    "galaxy identification is straightforward and robust in high resolution hydrodynamic simulations because the dissipated objects stand out distinctly from the background and from each other , with overdensities of @xmath18 or even higher .",
    "the physics of galactic scale star formation and feedback is an uncertainty in both the semi - analytic and the hydrodynamic simulation approaches , but at least within the range of assumptions explored by kwh the inferred galaxy population is insensitive to details of the star formation prescription .",
    "indeed , one finds nearly identical galaxy populations in simulations that include star formation and feedback and in simulations that have no star formation and identify galaxies directly as clumps of cold , dense gas ( whk , figure 10 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxy population is also completely insensitive to the presence of a photoionizing background in the mass range that we are presently able to resolve ( whk ) .",
    "since the observed - frame optical ( rest - frame uv ) luminosity of a @xmath6 galaxy depends mainly on its instantaneous star formation rate , the identification of which of our simulated galaxies would make it into an observed lyman - break galaxy sample _ is _ sensitive to our handling of star formation . through most of this paper",
    ", we will make the simplifying assumption that a simulated galaxy s uv luminosity is a monotonically increasing function of its baryonic mass , but in  4 we will briefly discuss the possibility that episodic star formation introduces large scatter into this relationship .",
    "we will address issues related to the luminosity function of lyman - break galaxies and the cosmic star formation history in a separate paper ( for preliminary results see weinberg , katz , & hernquist 1998 , hereafter wkh ) .",
    "the disadvantage of the numerical hydrodynamic approach to this problem is that computational expense forces us to adopt relatively small simulation volumes ; in the case of the models described here , periodic cubes 11.111@xmath19 comoving mpc on a side .",
    "this small volume affects our results in several ways .",
    "first , our simulation volume would contain only a handful of objects at the space density of the sadgpk sample , so we will mainly examine the clustering properties of the more numerous galaxies fainter than the magnitude limits of existing _ spectroscopic _ samples of high-@xmath20 objects .",
    "second , we have only a single realization of each model , and there might be significant statistical fluctuations in the clustering from one such volume to another .",
    "third , the absence of waves larger than our box causes us to systematically underestimate the true amplitude of clustering .",
    "while the nonlinear scale of the dark matter is generally much smaller than the box at @xmath21 , the galaxies exhibit stronger clustering than the dark matter .",
    "extreme regions like a proto - coma cluster or a proto - botes void would be as large as our simulation volume ( and the structure discovered by sadgpk might be roughly such a proto - coma region ) .",
    "our approach to estimating these finite volume effects ( in  3.4 below ) will be to assume that our hydrodynamic simulations correctly compute the _ relative _ amplitudes of the galaxy and dark matter correlation functions , allowing us to calibrate these bias factors in the hydrodynamic simulations and apply them to larger volume , lower resolution n - body simulations in order to estimate corrected correlation lengths .",
    "our treatment still leaves us with statistical and systematic uncertainties in the clustering predictions , which are probably comparable in magnitude to the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the current measurements .",
    "we can hope for significant progress on both the theoretical and observational fronts over the next few years .",
    "we perform our simulations using treesph ( @xcite ) , a code that unites smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ; @xcite ; @xcite ) with the hierarchical tree method for computing gravitational forces ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "dark matter , stars , and gas are all represented by particles ; collisionless material is influenced only by gravity , while gas is subject to gravitational forces , pressure gradients , and shocks .",
    "we include the effects of radiative cooling , assuming primordial abundances , and compton cooling .",
    "ionization and heat input from a uv radiation background are incorporated , assuming optically thin gas , using the radiation field computed by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) .",
    "we use a simple prescription to turn cold , dense gas into collisionless `` star '' particles .",
    "the technique and its computational implementation are described in detail by kwh . in brief",
    ", gas becomes `` eligible '' to form stars if it has a physical density corresponding to @xmath22 and an overdensity @xmath23 ( equivalent to that at the virial radius of an isothermal sphere ) .",
    "the gas must also reside in a convergent flow and be locally jeans unstable , although the density criteria themselves are usually sufficient to ensure this .",
    "eligible gas is converted to stars at a rate @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the maximum of the dynamical time and the cooling time .",
    "we use @xmath26 for the simulations here , but kwh show that the simulated galaxy population is insensitive to an order - of - magnitude change in @xmath27 , basically because the star formation rate is forced into approximate balance with the rate at which gas cools and condenses out of the hot halo . when star formation occurs , supernova heating is added to the surrounding gas assuming a standard imf from @xmath28 to @xmath29 and that stars above @xmath30 become supernovae .",
    "each supernova adds @xmath31 ergs of thermal energy to the system .",
    "because it uses a lagrangian hydrodynamics algorithm and individual particle time steps , treesph makes possible simulations with the enormous dynamic range needed to study galaxy formation in a cosmological context . in sph ,",
    "gas properties are computed by averaging or `` smoothing '' over a fixed number of neighboring particles , 32 in the calculations here . when matter is distributed homogeneously ,",
    "all particles have similar smoothing volumes .",
    "however , smoothing lengths in treesph are allowed to decrease in collapsing regions , in proportion to the interparticle separation , thus increasing the spatial resolution in precisely those regions where a high dynamic range is needed . in underdense regions ,",
    "the smoothing lengths are larger , but this is physically reasonable because the gas distribution _ is _ smoother in these regions , requiring fewer particles for an accurate representation .",
    "treesph allows particles to have individual time steps according to their physical state , so that the pace of the overall computation is not driven by the small fraction of particles requiring the smallest time steps . in the calculations described here ,",
    "the largest allowed timestep is @xmath32 years .",
    "the smallest allowed timestep is 16 times smaller , or @xmath33 years .",
    "if the courant condition would demand a timestep smaller than this minimum , we degrade the gas resolution ( increase the sph smoothing length ) so that the courant condition is satisfied .",
    "the timestep criteria are detailed further in kwh and quinn et al .  ( 1998 ) ; we set the tolerance parameter @xmath34 .",
    "here we present the results of five simulations , one each of five different cosmological models .",
    "all these simulations , of periodic cubes that are @xmath35 on a side , use @xmath36 particles and are evolved to @xmath4 .",
    "each has a nominal gas mass resolution ( 32 gas particles ) of @xmath37 and a spatial resolution ( gravitational softening length , in physical units ) of @xmath38 ( equivalent plummer softening ) .",
    "we adopt walker et al.s ( 1991 ) estimate of the baryon density , @xmath39 .",
    "we would not expect a higher value of @xmath40 ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , 1998 ; rauch et al .",
    "1997 ) to alter our clustering results , but it would increase the baryonic mass ( and presumably the luminosity ) of galaxies at fixed space density .",
    "we adopt the same fourier phases for the initial conditions of each model to minimize the impact of statistical fluctuations in our finite simulation volume on the comparison between models .",
    "our first model is `` standard '' cdm ( scdm ) , with @xmath1 , @xmath41 .",
    "the power spectrum is normalized so that the rms amplitude of mass fluctuations in @xmath42 spheres , linearly extrapolated to @xmath15 , is @xmath43 .",
    "this normalization is consistent with ( but somewhat higher than ) that advocated by white , efstathiou & frenk ( 1993 ) to match the observed masses of rich galaxy clusters .",
    "however , it is inconsistent with the normalization implied by the cobe - dmr experiment .",
    "our second model ( ccdm ) is identical to the first one except that @xmath44 , consistent with the 4-year cobe data ( @xcite ) but inconsistent with the @xmath15 cluster population .",
    "the third model , ocdm , assumes an open universe with @xmath3 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "it is cobe - normalized ( @xcite ) and produces an acceptable cluster mass function ( @xcite ) . the fourth model , a nonzero-@xmath47 cdm model ( lcdm ) , has @xmath3 , @xmath48 , @xmath45 , and an inflationary fluctuation spectrum tilted ( @xmath49 ) so that it simultaneously matches the cobe and cluster constraints .",
    "the fifth model ( tcdm ) is an @xmath1 , @xmath41 model that also has a tilted inflationary spectrum ( @xmath50 ) chosen so that it matches cobe and cluster constraints .",
    "we list the parameters of all the models in table 1 .",
    "we also include a lower resolution simulation of the scdm model evolved to @xmath51 ( from kwh ) .",
    "this simulation has 1/2 the spatial resolution and 1/8th the mass resolution of the other simulations , and it does not incorporate a photoionizing background .",
    ".models [ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     = 4.5truein",
    "our basic results are easy to summarize .",
    "while the five cdm models that we examine in this paper differ in their cosmological parameters , differ ( substantially ) in their mass clustering amplitudes , and differ ( slightly ) in their initial power spectrum shapes , they predict remarkably similar galaxy clustering at @xmath52 , 3 , and 2 .",
    "the galaxy correlation functions show almost no evolution over this redshift range , even though the mass correlation functions grow steadily . in most cases",
    "the high redshift galaxies are strongly biased tracers of the underlying mass , but the bias factor evolves with redshift and varies from model to model , roughly in inverse proportion to the amplitude of mass fluctuations .",
    "the more massive galaxies tend to be more highly clustered , though the trend is fairly weak over the mass range for which our @xmath53 measurements are statistically robust . in our lower resolution",
    "scdm simulation evolved to low redshift , the strength of galaxy clustering grows from @xmath4 to @xmath15 .",
    "the evolution of the galaxy correlation function in our simulations is qualitatively similar to that in analytic models that identify galaxies with high peaks of the initial density field ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxies are `` born '' strongly clustered and highly biased , and at early times the dark matter simply falls into the structures where the galaxies already reside , driving down the bias factor without substantially changing the galaxy correlation function .",
    "eventually the gravitational clustering of the dark matter begins to change the galaxy distribution , and the galaxy @xmath53 increases , as seen at low redshift in the scdm simulation .",
    "the evolution of @xmath53 is similar to that predicted in fry s ( 1996 ) analytic model , in which an initially biased galaxy distribution follows the dark matter velocity field .",
    "galaxy mergers and ongoing galaxy formation complicate the picture , however , as shown ( for example ) by the fact that the dark matter clustering actually overtakes the galaxy clustering at @xmath4 in our ccdm simulation .",
    "tegmark & peebles ( 1998 ) have recently described an elegant generalization of fry s ( 1996 ) approach that can incorporate ongoing galaxy formation and stochastic bias , but this is presently a framework for calculation rather than a predictive model of clustering evolution .",
    "we suspect that the semi - analytic / n - body approach ( @xcite ; @xcite ) would yield similar evolution predictions , but there are no published evolution results to which we can compare at present .",
    "our prediction of a strongly biased galaxy population at high redshift is similar to the prediction of models that identify lyman - break galaxies directly with the high mass tail of the dark halo population ( @xcite ; @xciteb ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . like the halo - based calculations , the sph simulations predict a trend of increasing bias with increasing galaxy mass .",
    "the trend appears to be somewhat weaker in the sph simulations than in the analytic halo model of mo & white ( 1996 ) ; in particular , we almost always find a positive galaxy bias even with a low circular velocity threshold and a correspondingly high galaxy space density .",
    "we also find a positive bias for friends - of - friends halos in an n - body simulation started from the same initial conditions as our scdm sph simulation ( figures  [ fig : halo ] and  [ fig : xihalo ] ) .",
    "the halos show a slightly stronger trend of bias with space density than that of the sph galaxies , at least for the commonly used linking parameter @xmath54 ( the halo clustering results also depend on the algorithm and parameters used for halo identification ) .",
    "it is not clear that our findings for halos conflict with previous results , since none that we know of show @xmath53 for low mass , high redshift halos in the non - linear regime , where @xmath55 .",
    "we also note that jing ( 1998 ) finds that in the quasi - linear regime the bias of low mass n - body halos is stronger than the mo & white ( 1996 ) analytic model predicts , though he still finds that the low mass halos are antibiased and finds agreement with the mo & white ( 1996 ) formula for high mass halos . for now , the most we can say is that the analytic formalism for the bias of halos in the linear regime should be used with some caution , especially if one is interpreting the clustering of galaxies in the non - linear regime , where the lyman - break galaxy correlation function is presently measured .    our best estimates of the predicted galaxy correlation lengths are those listed in table  [ tbl-5 ] and plotted in figure  [ fig : growth2 ] . at @xmath6 ,",
    "they lie in the range @xmath56 .",
    "these predictions apply to the full population of galaxies above our resolution limit .",
    "the more massive galaxies are more strongly clustered .",
    "one can find the predicted correlation length for galaxies with mass greater than @xmath57 by multiplying the value in table  [ tbl-5 ] by the ratio @xmath58^{2/|\\gamma| } \\approx b(m)/b({\\rm all})$ ] , read from figure  [ fig : bm ] , where @xmath59 is the bias factor for the full galaxy population ( the left end of the @xmath60 curve ) .",
    "the increase in @xmath61 is often @xmath62% or even more for the most massive galaxies , but it is rather uncertain because of our limited statistics .    from an analysis of the angular correlation function of lyman - break galaxy candidates , giavalisco et al .",
    "( 1998a ) find @xmath63 and a correlation amplitude that corresponds to @xmath9 for @xmath1 or @xmath64 for @xmath3 ( with either @xmath65 or @xmath48 ) .",
    "asgdpk estimate a significantly higher correlation length , @xmath66 ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 , @xmath65 ) , or @xmath69 ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) , from a counts - in - cells analysis of spectroscopically confirmed lyman - break objects .",
    "results by the ratios of angle - distance or redshift - distance relations yields @xmath72 for the parameters of our ocdm and lcdm models ; the scaling in asgdpk is somewhat different because they estimate @xmath61 separately for each cosmology using cubical cells whose redshift depth matches the angular size of the survey field . ]",
    "the effective redshift of both determinations is @xmath73 , and the difference between them provides an indication of the current level of measurement uncertainties .",
    "quantitative comparison between our results and these data is hampered by the non - overlapping space densities of the theoretical and observational samples .",
    "however , it at least seems clear that the models considered in this paper have no difficulty explaining the strong observed clustering of lyman - break galaxies . indeed , with a reasonable extrapolation of the @xmath60 vs. @xmath74 curves in figure  [ fig : bn ]",
    ", it seems that some of the models might overpredict even the stronger clustering found by asgdpk . interpreting their results in light of the mo & white ( 1996 ) halo biasing formula ,",
    "asgdpk conclude that their data favor a @xmath75 shape parameter for the primordial mass power spectrum over @xmath76 , but we find that the predicted galaxy correlation function in the sph simulations ( admittedly at a space density higher than that of the asgdpk sample ) depends only weakly on the shape or amplitude of the underlying mass power spectrum .",
    "steidel et al .",
    "( 1998b ) report preliminary results ( from giavalisco et al .",
    "1998b ) for the clustering of lower luminosity lyman - break galaxies , derived from the angular correlation function of @xmath77-band dropouts in the hubble deep field ( hdf ; @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated space density of this sample is 45 times higher than that of the asgdpk sample , and the estimated bias factor is 3 times lower ( @xcite , figure 7 ) .",
    "since the correlation length scales as @xmath78 , this lower bias factor implies ( in combination with the asgdpk results ) @xmath79 for @xmath1 and @xmath80 for @xmath3 , assuming @xmath81 . at the space density of the hdf sample",
    "there would be @xmath82 galaxies in our @xmath1 simulation boxes and @xmath83 galaxies in our @xmath3 simulation boxes , so it is reasonable to compare these numbers directly to the correlation lengths in table  [ tbl-5 ] .",
    "the simulations appear to predict excessively strong clustering for the giavalisco et al .",
    "( 1998b ) hdf sample , particularly with @xmath1 .",
    "given the current observational and theoretical uncertainties , it is premature to make much of this conflict , which at present has only marginal statistical significance .",
    "one source of theoretical uncertainty , the small size of our simulation volumes , is purely technical , and it will be remedied in the near future with larger simulations .",
    "the other source of theoretical uncertainty , the unknown relation between galaxy baryon mass and rest - frame uv luminosity , is more fundamental .",
    "because the clustering strength depends on galaxy mass ( figure  [ fig : bm ] ) , the correlation function predicted for a given lyman - break sample depends on how that sample probes the galaxy mass function .",
    "our conversion from galaxy mass to space density in figure  [ fig : bn ] implicitly assumes that the mass - luminosity relation is monotonic , so that a magnitude limited sample selects galaxies at the top end of the mass function .",
    "if episodic star formation or stochastic dust extinction introduce large scatter into the relation between galaxy mass and uv luminosity , then the predicted relation between clustering strength and space density will be flatter and the predicted clustering for bright lyman - break galaxy samples will be lower .    some papers on high redshift structure ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite )",
    "conclude that measurements of lyman - break galaxy clustering will in time provide valuable tests of cosmological models .",
    "other authors have argued that these measurements will ultimately teach us more about the nature of lyman - break galaxies themselves ( e.g. , sadgpk ; giavalisco et al .  1998a ; asgdpk ) . in this debate , we side firmly with the latter group .",
    "we have examined models with very different mass clustering properties , but the effects of biased galaxy formation conspire to erase the differences between them .",
    "this `` conspiracy '' is not as suspicious as it initially seems ; it simply reflects the fact that galaxies form at similar `` special '' locations in the density fields of the different models and therefore have similar spatial correlations ( figure  [ fig : circle ] ) .",
    "the ly@xmath16 forest provides a more straightforward route to testing the high redshift structure predictions of cosmological theories because the physics of the absorbing medium is relatively simple and leads to a direct relation between an observable quantity , the ly@xmath16 optical depth , and the underlying mass density ( wkh ) .",
    "indeed , the determination of the high redshift mass power spectrum by the method of croft et al .",
    "( 1998 ) will yield the bias factor of lyman - break galaxies as a by - product .",
    "given the complications introduced by bias , we think it is better to regard lyman - break galaxy clustering as a probe of galaxy formation physics rather than a test of cosmological models .",
    "the fact that the sph simulations ( and other approaches based on peaks , halos , or semi - analytic models ) account naturally for the observed strong clustering is already an encouraging success for the general scenario of hierarchical galaxy formation from gaussian primordial density fluctuations .",
    "comparison between the predicted trend of clustering strength against galaxy mass and the observable trend of clustering strength against luminosity can provide a more detailed test of theoretical models and an indication of whether the instantaneous star formation rate is tightly correlated with galaxy mass .",
    "this line of argument has already been pursued by sadgpk and asgdpk in the context of halo models . in the context of sph simulations ,",
    "the trend of clustering with uv luminosity can ultimately help to test whether our adopted paradigm for galactic scale star formation is basically correct or whether galaxy interactions or stochastic bursts have a strong influence on a high redshift galaxy s star formation rate .",
    "the study of high redshift galaxy clustering is still in its early phases , but progress in both observation and theory has been remarkably rapid , and it looks likely to continue .",
