    "the field of quantum plasmas has been rapidly growing over the last decade .",
    "in particular , studies regarding the nonlinear properties of systems in which quantum and collective effects play an important role have been in focus ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , there are also numerous studies of quantum plasmas where magnetization effects are of interest . here , the intrinsic magnetic moment of the plasma constituents give rise to new collective dynamical properties due to indirect spin interactions ( through effective field excitations ) as well as spin - velocity couplings .",
    "the above physical systems can be described in a multitude of ways . here",
    "we will give a short overview of part of such descriptions .",
    "we start with the `` heuristic '' approach of madelung , for which a decomposition of the system wave function into phase and amplitude leads to the definition of macroscopic density , velocity , and spin variables .",
    "we then go on to describe the more detailed effective field quantum kinetic theory , through which the relevant fluid moments may be defined and the concomitant fluid equations derived , as well as giving the opportunity to analyse proper kinetic effects in quantum plasma systems .",
    "we give a brief account of possible applications and results of the quantum fluid / kinetic models .",
    "a rather generic approach to quantum fluids is the use of a madelung decomposition of the system wave function , in which the amplitude is translated into a density and the gradient of the phase determines the velocity variable .",
    "such a decomposition will below be reviewed , and the results obtained will be compared later with the moment hierarchy obtained through a more rigorous quantum kinetics approach .",
    "the basic equation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is the schrdinger equation .",
    "the dynamics of an electron , represented by its wave function @xmath0 , in an external electromagnetic potential @xmath1 is governed by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is planck s constant , @xmath4 is the electron mass , and @xmath5 is the magnitude of the electron charge . this complex equation may be written as two real equations , writing @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the amplitude and @xmath8 the phase of the wave function , respectively holland .",
    "such a decomposition was presented by de broglie and bohm in order to understand the dynamics of the electron wave packet in terms of classical variables . using this decomposition in eq .",

    "the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrod - mom ] ) is the gradient of the bohm  de broglie potential , and is due to the effect of wave function spreading , giving rise to a dispersive - like term .",
    "we also note the striking resemblance of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : schrod - cont ] ) and ( [ eq : schrod - mom ] ) to the classical fluid equations .      the non - relativistic evolution of spin-1/2 particles , as described by the two - component spinor @xmath13 , is given by the pauli equation ( see , _",

    "now , in the same way as in the schrdinger case , we may decompose the electron wave function @xmath18 into its amplitude and phase .",
    "however , as the electron has spin , the wave function is now represented by a 2-spinor instead of a c - number .",

    ", we see a significant increase in the complexity of the fluid like equations due the presence of spin .",
    "the fact that the spin couples linearly to the magnetic field makes the dynamical aspects of such pauli systems very rich .",
    "moreover , when going over to the collective regime , the back reaction through maxwell s equation can yield interesting new properties of such spin plasmas .",
    "in fact , the introduction of an intrinsic magnetization can give rise to linear instability regimes , much like the jeans instability .",
    "as pointed out in the previous section , the route from single wavefunction dynamics to collective effects introduces a new complexity into the system . at the classical level ,",

    "we also note that due to quasi - neutrality , we have @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and we can thus express the quantum terms in terms of the total mass density @xmath106 , the centre - of - mass fluid velocity @xmath107 , and the current @xmath91 . with this , the spin transport equation ( [ eq : spin ] ) reads @xmath108    in the momentum equation ( [ eq : mhd - mom ] ) , neglecting the pressure and the bohm  de broglie potential for the sake of clarity , we have the force density @xmath109 . in general , for a magnetized medium with magnetization density @xmath110 , ampre s law gives the free current in a finite volume @xmath111 according to @xmath112 where we have neglected the displacement current .",
    "the surface current is an important part of the total current when we are interested in the forces on a finite volume , as was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite and will be shown below .",
    "it it worth noting that the expression of the force density in the momentum conservation equation can , to lowest order in the spin , be derived on general macroscopic grounds .",
    "formally , the total force density on a volume element @xmath111 is defined as @xmath113 , where @xmath114 are the different forces acting on the volume element , and might include surface forces as well . for magnetized matter ,",
    "the total force on an element of volume @xmath111 is then @xmath115 where ( neglecting the displacement current ) @xmath116 . inserting the expression for the total current into the volume integral and using the divergence theorem on the surface integral",
    ", we obtain the force density @xmath117 identical to the lowest order description from the pauli equation ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mhd - mom ] ) ) . inserting the free current expression ( eq : free - current ) , due to ampre s law , we can write the total force density according to @xmath118 the first gradient term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : total - force ] ) can be interpreted as the force due to a potential ( the energy of the magnetic field and the magnetization vector in that field ) , while the second divergence term is the anisotropic magnetic pressure effect .",
    "noting that the spatial part of the stress tensor takes the form @xcite @xmath119 we see that the total force density on the magnetized fluid element can be written @xmath120 , as expected .",
    "thus , the pauli theory results in the same type of conservation laws as the macroscopic theory . the momentum conservation equation ( [ eq : mhd - mom ] ) then reads @xmath121 where for the sake of clarity we have assumed an isotropic pressure , dropped the displacement current term in accordance with the nonrelativistic assumption , and neglected the bohm potential ( these terms can of course simply be added to ( [ eq : mhd - mom2 ] ) ) .",
    "this concludes the discussion of the spin - mhd plasma case .",
    "next , we will look at some applications of the derived equations .",
    "however , it should be noted that in many cases the spins are close to thermodynamic equilibrium , and we can thus write the paramagnetic electron response in terms of the magnetization brodin - marklund @xmath122 instead of using the full spin dynamics . here",

    "quantum mechanics in terms of quasi - distribution functions is perhaps the formulation with the closest resemblance to classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the formulation started with wigner s paper @xcite together with weyls correspondence principle @xcite . in terms of this formulation",
    "the state of the system is no longer described by a density matrix but instead a phase - space distribution function .",
    "similarly operators are translated into phase functions .",
    "calculating the expectation value of an operator is then a matter of calculating a phase space integral a corresponding function weighted by the distribution function .",
    "the method has been applied to a wide range of problems .",
    "for example it has been applied in optics glauber2,leonhardt , collision theory @xcite , nonlinear theory @xcite and transport problems in solid state physics , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "there are many different ways to define a quasi distribution function in quantum mechanics .",
    "the most known examples are probably the glauber - sudarshan p - distribution @xcite , the q - distribution @xcite and the related husimi distribution husimi .",
    "the many different definitions basically comes from the fact that the position and momentum operators do not commute , so the transformation between an operator and a phase space function is not unique .",
    "see for example @xcite for a review of the different phase space distribution functions .",
    "the wigner distribution corresponds to ordering the position and _ canonical _ momentum operators symmetrically .",
    "when considering a particle in a magnetic field gauge invariance has to be assured .",
    "this can be done by adding a phase factor to the definition of the wigner function @xcite .",
    "the phase factor will then compensate for the change of phase that occurs in the density matrix when performing a gauge transformation .",
    "when dealing with the gauge invariant wigner - stratonovich the weyl correspondence is modified @xcite .",
    "the natural variables to use are the position and _ kinetic _ momentum .",
    "the formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of phase space distributions has also been generalized for spin particles cohen , chandler , scully , cunha .",
    "also in this case the definition is not unique and one can find analogs to the different definitions in the phase space case @xcite .      the distribution function which we will work with here is the combination of the wigner distribution function @xcite for the phase - space variables and the q - function for the spin degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "this combination of distribution functions was used in @xcite and it turns out to yield a intuitive description of spin-1/2 particles in an extended phase space .",

    "as in the classical approach all intrinsically kinetic features such as landau damping will be lost , and one is faced with a closure problem , since the fluid hierarchy is an infinite series of equations that needs to be truncated at some point .",
    "quantum fluid moments derived from the wigner formalism have been applied before , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite , and also in the case of gauge invariant wigner - stratonovich formalism@xcite . in the spin-1/2 case",
    "the moments have also been calculated @xcite starting from a quantum kinetic equation @xcite . in their treatment",
    "they use a matrix form of the kinetic equation and they also retain the collision terms which we here will neglect . however , their fluid hierarchy is only discussed shortly and also it is derived to order @xmath3 and hence , for example the effect of the dipole term on the dynamics was not retained .",
    "since we are working with a quasi distribution function in a phase space extended to also include the microscopic spin variable , the classical approach must be slightly modified .",
    "firstly we also need to integrate over the microscopic spin variable , and furthermore a new macroscopic spin variable is defined , leading to a new hierarchy of spin - dependent macroscopic objects @xcite .",
    "thus we define the moments as @xmath185 here the first four moments are respectively the density , the fluid velocity , the pressure density and the energy flux density .",
    "the equation moment above defines the spin density @xmath186 which yields the average spin density at position @xmath187 and time @xmath188 .",
    "the factor 3 in this definition occurs due to the correspondence .",
    "the sixth moment is a mixed moment of the velocity and the spin which will act as some kind of spin - pressure .",
    "finally , we have a mixed spin - velocity - velocity moment which could perhaps be termed the spin - pressure correlation . similarly we could go on to define even higher order moments like the energy flux or a higher order mixed moment .",
    "note that there is no need to include higher order moments in the spin variable since we have that @xmath189 .    using the evolution equation for the extended phase space distribution function",
    "we may now calculate the evolution equation of the different moments @xmath190 where @xmath191 .",
    "it is possible to derive the evolution equation for the @xmath192 , see @xcite and @xmath193 , however , these moments will then couple to even higher order moments . instead some approximation is needed . in our paper zamanian2010b",
    "we used the closure @xmath194 and @xmath195 , which is perhaps the easiest one to deal with .",
    "as can be seen in eq .  , the spin - velocity moment @xmath196 acts as a pressure term in the evolution equation for the spin density . by including this moment , it is possible to capture some kinetic effects in a fluid theory . some problems which might be difficult or tedious to solve in a kinetic theory may be reachable within a fluid theory .",
    "however , the exact role of the spin - velocity moment is a subject of further research .",
    "it is shown in the previous section treating the kinetic equation that the distribution function can be divided in two parts , one for each spin direction along the magnetic field .",
    "each fluid is seen to obey the same hierarchy as above @xcite , and we will just have two sets of these equations , one for each species . of course we will have separate macroscopic quantities @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 for each species . here",
    "the subscript @xmath201 indicates which species the quantities refer to .",
    "this approach adds a bit of complexity but can capture some kinetic effects due to a the different dynamics of the two spin states , and is therefore worth pursuing in problems were such physics is expected to play a role@xcite .",
    "the various quantum models developed cover several physical effects .",
    "effects of the fermi pressure and particle dispersion has been described in some detail in refs .",
    "@xcite both within fluid theories and within a kinetic approach .",
    "the fluid approach uses the so called bohm - de broglie potential to get an effective quantum force in the momentum equation , and the equation of state is chosen such as to get the fermi pressure .",
    "several modifications of classical behavior due to such models has been described in the literature , see the references in ref .",
    "shukla - eliasson for an up - to - date list .",
    "many papers using kinetic approaches cover the effects of particle dispersion and fermi pressure , but using a wigner function derived without the magnetic dipole coupling of the pauli hamiltonian . in this way",
    "all effects due to the magnetic dipole force and spin magnetization is left out .",
    "in contrast to the these works , we will here focus on physical effects directly associated with the spin - coupling in the pauli - hamiltonian , which give raise to the magnetic dipole force , the spin precession and the spin magnetization in the above presented models .",
    "most of the recent results along these lines has been derived from models similar to those presented here .",
    "the most basic question to ask concerning the electron spin - properties in a plasma is `` when are they important ? '' . for spin effects due to the fermi - pressure",
    "this is straightforward to answer .",
    "the fermi - pressure becomes important when the fermi temperature approaches the thermodynamic temperature , which give a simple condition on the temperature and density of a plasma .",
    "for the effects due to the direct spin - coupling in the pauli - hamiltonian the answer is less straightforward , as it depends on the full parameter regime ( involving also the magnetic field strength ) but also on the specific geometry of the fields . during certain geometric configurations",
    ", the spin effects can be important in regimes of modest density and modest temperature , which traditionally has been thought to be completely classical @xcite .",
    "a specific example of this kind can be found in the mhd - regime . in ref .",
    "@xcite fluid equations of the type ( [ eq : mom - pauli])-([eq : spin ] ) was adopted to mhd - regime , in order to study the physics of nonlinear spin - modified alfvn waves . within linear theory ,",
    "the alfvn waves was almost unaffected by the spin terms , provided the zeeman energy associated with the unperturbed magnetic field @xmath202 was much smaller than the thermal energy , i.e. @xmath203 .",
    "this condition holds for most plasmas except close to pulsars and/or magnetars .",
    "however , nonlinearly the situation is different .",
    "@xcite used a two - fluid spin - model based on ( eq : mom - pauli)-([eq : spin ] ) , where spin - up and spin - down populations were formally treated as different species , as a means to capture certain kinetic effects within a more simple fluid theory .",
    "from this theory a nonlinear schrdinger equation@xmath204for alfvn waves propagating parallel to the magnetic field was derived , where @xmath205 is the slowly varying magnetic field amplitude , @xmath206 is the group dispersion , @xmath207 is the comoving coordinate and @xmath208 is the group velocity .",
    "these quantities are determined from the alfvn wave dispersion relation , which reads @xmath209 , when weakly dispersive effects due to the hall current is included @xcite . here",
    "@xmath210 is the alfvn velocity and @xmath211 is the ion - cyclotron frequency .",
    "the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to right ( left ) hand circular polarization .",
    "the nonlinear coefficient is @xmath212@xmath213@xmath214 $ ] , where the classical coefficient is @xmath215 @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the ion - sound speed .",
    "although linearly the modification of the alfvn waves can be neglected ( for modest temperature and densities ) , the nonlinear coefficient @xmath218 could be significantly affected by the spin terms .",
    "illustration of the parameters needed to make the different quantum plasma effects significant , is shown in fig .",
    "in particular we note that the two - fluid nonlinear spin effects are important for high plasma densities and/or a weak ( external ) magnetic fields . for comparison ,",
    "both the fermi pressure and the bohm  de broglie potential need a low - temperature or a very high density to be significant .. a somewhat surprising result is that here nonlinear spin effects tend to be more important for a lower magnetic field , whereas the opposite is true for linear spin effects .    ;",

    "lines for three different magnetic field strengths are drawn .",
    "the quantum regime correspond to lower temperatures , i.e. it exists below each of the three horizontal lines ; ( v ) spin two - fluid nonlinear effects , described by the parameter @xmath222 .",
    "the quantum regime corresponds to higher densities , i.e. it exists to the right of each of the three vertical lines . _ ]    as a second example of spin fluid effects we will consider the ponderomotive force of an electromagnetic wave propagating along an external magnetic field .",

    "the index @xmath230 refers to the up- and down populations , respectively .",
    "in particular the up- and down spin vector components are @xmath231 , and @xmath232 .",
    "thus it is clear that the spin - part of the ponderomotive force induces a separation of the up- and down - populations .",
    "this effect survives also in the absence of an external magnetic field , and it turns out that the magnitude of the relative up - and down density perturbations can be larger than the classical density perturbations in an unmagnetized plasma , provided@xmath233where @xmath234 is the pulse length of the high - frequency pulse .",
    "the first factor of the right hand side of ( [ condtion ] ) is smaller than unity for frequencies below the compton frequency , but the second factor can be large for long pulse lengths , and hence large spin - polarization can be induced by a sufficiently long em - pulse in an unmagnetized plasma for optical frequencies and higher . once the plasma is spin - polarized , the spin terms in the evolution equations can be important for the dynamics . for further studies of results from spin - fluid theories , see e.g. refs .",
    "ferro , spin - solitons .      the full kinetic theory ( [ j8 ] )",
    "is accurate , but cumbersome for many purposes .",
    "as seen from the full ( [ j8 ] ) , the effects separates quite naturally into particle dispersive effects ( which are insignificant for spatial scale lengths much longer than the characteristic de broglie wavelength ) , and effects due to the electron spin .",
    "the particle dispersive effects has been studied in some detail in e.g. refs .",
    "manfredi2005,shukla - eliasson .",
    "focusing on the spin effects rather than particle effects , we can therefore consider the long scale - length equation ( [ j12 ] ) .",
    "an interesting effect of spin - kinetic theory is the appearance of new wave - particle resonances .",
    "linearized theory in a magnetized plasma can be solved in much the same way as in a classical plasma ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for technical details ) .",
    "however , due to the fact that the spin - precession frequency @xmath235 and the larmor gyration occurs @xmath236 are slightly different ( i.e. @xmath237 ) new resonances appear .",
    "in particular the denominators of of the perturbed distribution function in kinetic theory are replaced as @xmath238when spin - kinetic effects are included , where the integer @xmath7 covers @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "thus for a fixed parallel phase velocity , resonant wave - particle interaction can occur at a much lower temperature when spin effects are taken into account , since @xmath241 .",
    "this aspect has been discussed in some detail in ref .",
    "furthermore , for perpendicular propagation to the external magnetic field , new bernstein - like modes appear with frequencies close to the resonant value @xmath242 .",
    "specifically the dispersion relation for perpendicular propagation , reads@xmath243 \\big\\}f_{0}\\,d\\omega .",
    "\\label{eq - dr}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath244 and @xmath245 are zero and first order bessel functions , respectively . here",
    "we have assumed the classical terms involving higher order bessel - functions are negligible , which is accurate for @xmath246 .",
    "the numerical solutions of ( [ eq - dr ] ) reveals that the wave frequency only deviates slightly from the resonance @xmath247 for most parameters @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a madelung approach ( c.f .",
    "eqs ( [ eq : mom - pauli])-([eq : spin ] ) ) can not capture the physics of the resonances at @xmath248 .",
    "however , the moment theory ( [ cont - mom - exp])-([14 ] ) correctly recovers the dispersion relation in the low temperature limit zamanian2010b . due to the higher order moments ,",
    "however , it should be noted that this theory is computationally somewhat more demanding than eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mom - pauli])-([eq : spin ] ) , at least if the higher order spin effects are omitted in that theory .",
    "other works on spin kinetic theory includes ref .",
    "@xcite , where the general linear theory based on ( [ j12 ] ) was studied in a magnetized plasma , refs .",
    "@xcite , where a simpler version of ( [ j12 ] ) ( a semiclassical correspondence without the magnetic dipole force term ) was studied with regard to fusion applications , and ref .",
    "@xcite where a semiclassical version of ( [ j12 ] ) was adopted to consider spin induced damping of electron plasma oscillations .",
    "a rapid development of spin - models for plasmas has taken place during the last few years , using different types of methods .",
    "the most accurate are the kinetic approach , based on the combined wigner and q - transforms of the density matrix .",
    "this theory captures not only the spin effects , but also the particle dispersive effects .",
    "however , for scale lengths longer than the characteristic de broglie wavelengths only the spin effects remain , as described by ( [ j12 ] ) . while the kinetic approach is accurate , and contains much interesting physics , as for example the resonances displayed in eq .",
    "( [ resonances ] ) , there is a simultaneous need for models that are simple enough to be applied also for more complicated problems , involving inhomogenities and nonlinearities .",
    "various fluid approaches have been adopted for this purpose .",
    "those based on the madelung approach capture most of the spin - physics in the physically intuitive effects of a magnetic dipole force and spin precession , together with a spin magnetization current .",
    "such approaches has been used in several recent works , see e.g. ferro , spin - solitons , brodinspinpond . however , higher order quantum terms also appear in this context , which either must be modelled or omitted , in order to form a closed set for the fluid variables . another approach to obtain fluid theories is by computing moments of the kinetic theory .",
    "the basic terms ( i.e. spin - precession and the magnetic dipole force ) are the same as in the madelung approach , but now a spin - velocity correlation tensor appears in the evolution equation for the spin .",
    "this has a correspondence in the tensor of ( [ k - tensor ] ) in the madelung approach , but here things are complicated by the presence of other terms such as given by ( [ omega ] ) .",
    "thus an advantage with the moment approach is that it is straightforward to model the spin - velocity tensor by computing the corresponding moment . as always when",
    "taking moments , the coupling to a higher moment appear , but truncating the moment expansion in the next step ( i.e. dropping higher order moments in the evolution equation for the spin - velocity tensor ) seem to capture most basic spin physics , and leave out only thermal effects zamanian2010b . however , even when one is interested in the low temperature limit , certain effects of a nonzero temperature should be kept to address the behavior in the more common plasma regimes .",
    "this has to do with the fact that the zeeman energy is typically much smaller than the thermal energy ( i.e. @xmath249 ) , such that in thermodynamic equilibrium the two spin states are almost equally populated . as a consequence , even if the temperature is small in all other respects ( i.e. all characteristic velocities of a system is larger than the thermal ( or fermi ) velocity ) , there is a large spread in the spin distribution . as a means to capture some of the physics associated with this large spread",
    ", two - fluid theories of electrons has been developed where up- and down states with respect to the ( unperturbed ) magnetic field are described as different species , as described briefly in section 3.1 . to some extent the fluid theories including the spin - velocity tensor seem able to account for some of the effects of the spread in the spin distribution , but it is too early to make a definitive evaluation of the various models strengths and weaknesses .",
    "thus the final conclusion is that more research on the physics of electron spin in plasmas is needed ."
