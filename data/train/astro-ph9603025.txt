    "the pulsations exhibited by some pg  1159 stars help us in this endeavor . with the tools of asteroseismology in hand ,",

    "high radial overtone @xmath3 modes of low spherical harmonic index @xmath4 can show multiplet structure ; rotation can split each one into @xmath5 peaks in the power spectrum . other effects , such as a stellar magnetic field , cause frequency splitting about the @xmath6 mode in a given multiplet",
    ". this splitting can be asymmetric depending on the field geometry .    despite the potential complexity",
    ", only modes with low @xmath4 have been identified in gw vir stars .",
    "thus the power spectrum is not necessarily complex beyond comprehension .",
    "kawaler & bradley ( 1994 ) showed that the average period spacing between modes of the same @xmath4 and consecutive @xmath7 depends primarily on the total stellar mass , with lesser dependence on luminosity and only a very slight dependence on composition .",

    "the task of decoding the power spectrum of a real star is complicated because not all possible modes are necessarily present .",
    "also , the periodic intervention of the earth between the telescope and the star introduces aliases into the frequency spectrum which confuse mode identification .",
    "the aliasing problem currently is addressed using the whole earth telescope ( wet , nather et al .",
    "a major success of wet came in 1989 , when observers at telescopes around the globe obtained two weeks of almost continuous data on the class prototype , pg  1159035 ( hereafter pg  1159 ) .",
    "this minimized the aliasing and allowed winget et al .",
    "( 1991 ) to conclusively identify pulsation modes .",
    "they found an unbroken sequence of almost twenty multiplets  each corresponding to @xmath9 and consecutive @xmath7along with several @xmath10 modes .",
    "the total stellar mass , the rotation rate , and the envelope mass were determined with unprecedented precision , showing that asteroseismological models could be used with confidence to study the pg  1159 pulsation phenomenon .",
    "recently , kawaler et al . (",
    "1995 ) analyzed a second pg  1159 star , pg  2131 + 066 , again using wet data .",
    "pg  2131 displayed a much simpler frequency spectrum : only a few consecutive @xmath9 triplets , and no @xmath10 modes , were identified .",
    "the data from wet observations of other pg  1159 stars are currently in analysis .",
    "the star pg  0122 + 200 ( bb psc , @xmath11 ) was identified as a member of the pg  1159 spectral class by wesemael , green , & liebert ( 1985 ) .",
    "dreizler et al . (",
    "1995 ) report a surface gravity of log @xmath12 , and an effective temperature of @xmath13  k , placing pg  0122 among the coolest pg  1159 stars .",
    "bond & grauer ( 1987 ) discovered variability in pg  0122 , reporting a power spectrum dominated by variations at 402.3  s and 443.7  s. hill , winget , & nather ( 1987 , hereafter hwn ) observed the star in white light on four consecutive nights in late 1986 with the 2.1 m reflector at mcdonald observatory .",
    "they tentatively identified eight pulsation modes between 300  s and 700  s , and suggested a mean period spacing of 16.4  s. this implied a mass of @xmath14 , based on models developed by kawaler ( 1987 ) .    at the time hwn",
    "published their observations , rotational splitting had not been resolved in the power spectrum of any of the hot degenerate stars , so that identification of the value of @xmath4 and @xmath7 for individual modes in these stars remained uncertain .",
    "wet observations have since led to measurement of @xmath9 rotational splitting for pg  1159 ( @xmath15 @xmath16hz ) and pg  2131 ( @xmath17",
    "@xmath16hz ) , implying rotation rates ( see equation  [ 3 ] below ) of 1.38 days and 5.07 hours respectively .",
    "all of the high  amplitude variation in both stars is attributed to @xmath9 triplets , with a series of low amplitude @xmath10 modes discovered in pg  1159 .",
    "armed with insight gained from these observations , we reanalyzed the hwn data .",
    "we hypothesized that the power spectrum of pg  0122 was comprised of @xmath9 rotationally split triplets .",
    "if pg  0122 had the complex mode structure of pg  1159 , this analysis  based on single ",
    "site data  would have failed .",
    "luckily , pg  0122 is a simple star that is remarkably similar to pg  2131 in the sparseness of its frequency spectrum .",
    "this allowed us to test our hypothesis without multi ",
    "site observations .",
    "this paper describes our reanalysis of the hwn data . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the observations and their reduction .",
    "section  3 outlines our analysis , including our efforts to separate peaks from aliases and the evidence for equal period spacing in the power spectrum . in section  4 ,",
    "we use the periods to constrain the physical properties of the star , and we conclude with section  5 .",
    "hwn obtained a total of 4,609 5second and 6,137 10second integrations over four consecutive nights ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we reduced these data following the procedures in nather et al .",
    "figure  1 presents the data after summing to produce 40second integrations .",
    "subsequent analysis was performed on the unsummed data .",
    "note the change in amplitude in the light curve from night to night , which was mentioned by hwn as possibly deriving from fine structure in the frequency spectrum of pg  0122 ( i.e. , beating ) .",
    "figure  2 shows the power spectrum of the entire data set , out to the highest frequency showing significant power above noise .",
    "the power spectrum was obtained by squaring the modulus of the fourier transform ( ft ) of the light curve , resulting in a plot of modulation power ( mp ) versus frequency , where mp  =  ( @xmath18i / i)@xmath19 , as discussed in winget et al .",
    "the low frequency power ( below about 1000 @xmath16hz ) is due primarily to extinction and sky brightness variations in the atmosphere .",
    "the decrease of power at zero frequency is a consequence of the data reduction procedure .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  2 indicate the power @xmath20 corresponding to different false alarm probabilities @xmath21(@xmath20 ) , calculated according to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of data points and @xmath24@xmath20@xmath25 is the average power , calculated over the @xmath23/2 independent frequencies @xmath26 which characterize the data : @xmath27 @xmath28 is the total time spanned by the data set .",
    "@xmath21(@xmath20 ) is the probability that noise will generate a peak of a given power at least once among the frequencies in equation  [ 2 ] .",
    "though power spectra are usually presented over  resolved for clarity , calculating the ft at more than n/2 frequencies adds no information about the data , since the `` extra '' frequencies are not independent of those in equation  [ 2 ] ( c.f .",
    "horne & baliunas , 1986 ) . unlike a statistical analysis which evaluates confidence by considering only how many standard deviations a peak stands above the local mean , the false alarm probability also accounts for the increasing probability that a peak of specific size will occur by chance as the number of independent data points increases .",
    "for example , when an ft includes 25,000 independent frequencies , the chance that at least one noise peak will have three times the mean power is @xmath2999% .",
    "the false alarm probability provides a much more conservative and realistic criterion for judging the significance of a peak in the power spectrum .",
    "we reiterate that we calculate @xmath24@xmath20@xmath25 over _ all _ the frequencies in equation  [ 2 ] , from @xmath30/t to the nyquist frequency n/2 t . thus even though fap analysis assumes normally distributed noise , we chose not to filter the data either to remove the low - frequency `` atmospheric noise '' ( which is certainly _ not _ normally distributed ) evident in figure  2 , or to remove the real stellar variations .",
    "as a result , our fap levels are overly conservative for the frequency range we analyze , but we prefer this to the alternative which requires subjective evaluation of atmospheric noise .",
    "consequently , our faps should not be regarded as an absolute measure of peak significance , but as an objective , conservative guide that the reader can apply to the power spectrum of pg  0122 .",
    "figure  3 shows the frequency region of primary power ( excluding low frequency atmospheric variations ) in the spectrum of pg  0122 . for comparison , the spectral window ( on the lower right of figure  3 ) depicts the transform of a single noise ",
    "free sinusoid , sampled at the same times as the actual data .",
    "this power spectrum shows seven groups of peaks , six of which correspond to periods identified in 1987 .",
    "we were unable to confirm the existence of significant variation at 435  s and 364  s ( 2300  @xmath16hz and 2750  @xmath16hz ) reported by hwn .",
    "there is evidence for slight excess power at these periods , but so close to noise that we did not include them in our analysis .",
    "one additional peak , not listed in the 1987 paper , is clearly discernible in the transform , at 570  s ( 1755  @xmath16hz ) .",
    "comparison to the spectral window shows that most frequency groups are more complex than the pattern formed by a single periodicity , indicating the possible presence of a companion .",
    "only the group near 1630  @xmath16hz ( and perhaps the one at 1755  @xmath16hz ) apparently represents the spectrum of a single sinusoid .",
    "the other groups , and especially the region around 2640  @xmath16hz , are more complex than the window pattern",
    ". in particular , the group at 2220  @xmath16hz seems at first glance to represent the combination of two window  like peak groups , one of which is smaller in amplitude and offset from the other by a few @xmath16hz in frequency .",
    "to separate closely spaced frequencies , we consecutively calculated linear least  squares fits for all eight identified frequency groups .",
    "the data were then `` prewhitened '' at the largest peak in a region to look for lower amplitude variations .",
    "this was accomplished by subtracting from the light curve , point by point , a sine wave of the frequency , amplitude and phase determined by the least  squares analysis of a given peak .",
    "smaller peaks identified in this way were then fitted with sine waves simultaneously with the larger peaks in the original data set .",
    "the precision of frequency determinations for the previously known peaks was also greatly improved by this process .",
    "this procedure has proven highly successful in recovery of low  amplitude variations from wet data , where even the residual alias can swamp small peaks .",
    "we describe below the details of this method as we applied it to the archival pg  0122 data .",
    "table  2 summarizes the frequencies , amplitudes , and mode identifications for the periodicities found in the light curve of pg  0122 .    in the process of prewhitening we encountered the inevitable problem of distinguishing real power from sampling aliases . in every case",
    ", we applied the simple algorithm of choosing the largest ( and therefore most statistically likely ) peak as representing the real power .",
    "thus although our identification of peaks is not the only one consistent with the data , it is the most likely solution . in the next section",
    "we show that the rules we followed lead to a set of observed peaks with frequencies that are entirely consistent with rotationally split @xmath9 triplets equally spaced in period .    starting with the region of greatest power ( the group at 2500  @xmath16hz ) we assumed that the largest peak represented a true pulsation mode and we removed it .",
    "figure  4 shows the result .",
    "the remaining power spectrum , depicted in panel b ) of the figure , illustrates how prewhitening works .",
    "we could in principle defend the choice of any of the three largest remaining peaks as representing real power , but we again chose the largest and most probable peak , and removed it .",
    "the remaining power , shown in panel c ) of figure  4 , is also consistent with a single periodicity .",
    "when it too is removed , no power remains above noise , as shown in panel d ) .",
    "figure  5 further demonstrates that our solution is consistent with the original data .",
    "the top panel shows the power spectrum of pg  0122 , while the lower panel depicts the power spectrum of a noise free time series , sampled at the same times as the data , constructed using three sine waves of the frequency , amplitude , and phase determined by a simultaneous least ",
    "squares solution .",
    "choosing different aliases at each stage of prewhitening might lead to equally good reconstructions but would require that we choose less probable peaks , leading in some cases to the further necessity of invoking a greater number of peaks to explain the same region of power .    to within the formal error from the least - squares fit ,",
    "the splitting is uniform , with @xmath24@xmath31@xmath25  @xmath32  @xmath16hz .",
    "this group is thus entirely consistent with our hypothesis that the power in pg  0122 consists primarily of @xmath9 triplet modes .",
    "the next largest groups are those at 2220  @xmath16hz and 2970  @xmath16hz .",
    "successive prewhitening , using the same prescription as above , revealed that each consists of two peaks separated by roughly twice @xmath31 found in the previously identified triplet : @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the 2220  @xmath16hz and 2970  @xmath16hz groups , respectively .",
    "again , in selecting peaks we always chose the most probable peak remaining after prewhitening to be `` real . ''",
    "this choice is supported by identification of frequency splittings consistent with those in the largest group .",
    "these two groups can be identified as @xmath9 if we allow that in each case a central ( @xmath35 ) mode has not been detected .",
    "this is highly plausible in light of the results of the study of pg  1159 and pg  2131 ; in both stars the ratio of the amplitudes of modes of different @xmath8 within a multiplet can approach an order of magnitude .",
    "this degree of amplitude asymmetry could easily place one or more peaks in a given multiplet below the level of noise .",
    "there are two more groups which show apparent multiplet structure , at 2640  @xmath16hz and at 2140  @xmath16hz .",
    "the first of the these was found to be a doublet with frequency splitting @xmath36  @xmath16hz . here , too , our simple algorithm of selecting the most likely peaks as real leads to the identification of a splitting consistent with every other group analyzed thus far .",
    "this leaves only the group at 2140  @xmath16hz , which we now discuss at some length , since it does not fit the established pattern .",
    "the prewhitening procedure shows that the 2140  @xmath16hz group is a doublet with a splitting of @xmath37  @xmath16hz , a number inconsistent with identification of this mode with the same value of @xmath4 as the other peaks in the power spectrum .",
    "however , the ratio of the splitting in the @xmath9 multiplets to that of the 2140  @xmath16hz doublet is @xmath38 , which is approximately the asymptotic ratio of @xmath39 between @xmath9 and @xmath10 rotational splittings ( see below ) . identifying this group as @xmath10 explains its failure to conform to the splitting found in every other multiplet .    in the final stages of writing this paper",
    ", we received a preprint of a paper by vauclair et al .",
    "( 1995 ) reporting on analysis of photometry of pg  0122 in october 1990 .",
    "one of the principal problems they discuss is the identification of @xmath4 for the 2140  @xmath16hz multiplet . in our data two consecutive@xmath8 modes",
    "are present , allowing us to positively identify the @xmath10 frequency splitting of 5.4  @xmath16hz .",
    "the two peaks present in their data are not consecutive in @xmath8 .",
    "this is not unusual behavior for the gw  vir stars ; they frequently show season  to  season amplitude variations .",
    "thus the @xmath10 splitting was not apparent in 1990 , and vauclair et al .",
    "decided that this mode was probably a mixture of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . when our peak list for this multiplet is combined with the one from vauclair et al .",
    ", the result is a single group of three peaks with splittings of @xmath40  @xmath16hz and @xmath41  @xmath16hz  =  @xmath42  @xmath16hz .",
    "the combined list represents three of five possible @xmath10 components with a splitting of @xmath43  @xmath16hz .    in an important respect",
    ", vauclair et al.s observations also reinforce our idea of the 2970  @xmath16hz multiplet as an @xmath9 mode . in our data , we see a doublet ( @xmath44  @xmath16hz and 2973.6  @xmath16hz ) with the central ( @xmath35 ) mode missing .",
    "vauclair et al .",
    "see a mode at 2970.2  @xmath16hz , halfway between our two modes , providing further confirmation of the identification of the @xmath9 splitting of @xmath45  @xmath16hz .    at this point",
    "we have no doubt this analysis , based at every stage on the simplest and most likely deconvolution of individual regions of power , has borne out the hypothesis that the power spectrum of pg  0122 is dominated by @xmath9 modes .",
    "a total of thirteen independent periods were identified in the light curve ( see table  2 ) ; all but two are members of multiplets in the power spectrum .",
    "the average frequency splitting in these multiplets can now be used to determine the rotation rate of pg  0122 .",
    "the frequency splitting for peaks of consecutive @xmath8 in each mode is set by the stellar rotation period @xmath46 according to @xmath47 where @xmath48",
    ". this splitting is not uniform among the @xmath9 modes we identified .",
    "the minimum range , given the uncertainty in the frequency determinations , is 7% from the smallest splitting to the largest .",
    "this result is not unusual , however ; the range in @xmath31 among the most certain modes identified in pg  1159 is close to 10% ( winget et al .",
    "the average value found in the four @xmath9 modes in the power spectrum of pg  0122 is @xmath49hz .",
    "this implies that pg  0122 rotates about its axis once every @xmath50 days .",
    "note that the identification of the peaks near 2140 @xmath16hz as @xmath10 allows a determination of the rotation rate from that mode alone of @xmath51 days ; this is approximately the same rotation rate derived using the triplet modes .",
    "the most striking feature of the frequency pattern is its simplicity  very few modes account completely for a complex light curve . with the exception of the @xmath10 doublet at 465  s ( 2140  @xmath16hz ) ,",
    "every multiplet is consistent with @xmath9 .",
    "we show below that , as expected from theory and previous experience , the @xmath9 modes are each separated from the others by multiples of a fundamental period spacing .",
    "the evidence for equal period spacing in the power spectrum of pg  0122 is summarized in table  3 .",
    "this simple model , with @xmath52  s , accounts for every @xmath9 mode identified in the star .",
    "this period spacing , for @xmath9 , implies a mass of @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , the two singlet modes at 570  s ( 1754  @xmath16hz ) and 612  s ( 1632  @xmath16hz ) fit the @xmath9 period spacing quite well , though of course the value of @xmath4 for these two peaks can not be constrained from frequency splitting . finally , the singlet just above the surrounding power at 1430  @xmath16hz fits well into the pattern .",
    "though these singlet peaks can not stand alone in support of the proposed pattern , they are accounted for by it .",
    "the proximity of the 465  s mode to the one at 450  s implies that one of them has a different value of @xmath4 than the other modes .",
    "the 465  s mode fits the period spacing pattern far better than does the 450  s mode , which tends to support the identification of the 465  s mode as @xmath9 and the 450  s mode as @xmath54 .",
    "unfortunately , as discussed in the previous section , the frequency splittings in each mode support the opposite conclusion : @xmath10 for the 465  s mode , and @xmath9 for the 450  s mode .",
    "however , we prefer the identifications based on frequency splitting , since mode trapping can cause the period spacing to vary from mode to mode over a much larger range than will the frequency splittings ( @xmath55 varies by about 20% of @xmath24@xmath56 in pg  1159 , for instance ) .    the pulsational data are thus consistent with a pattern of @xmath0mode periods seen independently in previous observations of pg  1159 and pg  2131 .",
    "our model accounts for every peak , and there is none left over . in the only case where the spectrum does not conform to both equal period spacing and uniform frequency splitting  the 465  s doublet  theory accounts readily for the anomaly",
    "the power spectrum of pg  0122 is a set of rotationally split @xmath9 multiplets equally spaced in period , with one mode identified as @xmath10 .",
    "these results are in accord with those of the other pg  1159 stars previously analyzed .",
    "these results do not agree with the conclusions reached by vauclair et al .",
    "unfortunately , the absence of some modes robbed them of the ability to detect the 21.2  s period spacing .",
    "they find 10 periods in their data .",
    "seven of their ten peaks are at essentially the same frequencies in the hwn data we analyzed , but the amplitudes in the vauclair et al .",
    "data averaged 3.6 times smaller . in particular , the triplet at 379.6  s was absent in their data . as mentioned before ,",
    "this behavior is not atypical of the gw  vir stars .",
    "the primary problem this created was a misidentification of the 465  s multiplet as a mixture of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this caused vauclair et al . to conclude incorrectly that the period spacing was 16.1  s. discarding the 465  s group from measurements of @xmath9",
    "period spacing makes the observations of vauclair et al .",
    "inadequate to determine @xmath57 without ambiguity ; they only have three @xmath9 modes , none consecutive in @xmath7 .",
    "we are fortunate to have two consecutive @xmath9 modes ( 379.6  s and 401.0  s ) in our data .",
    "the spacing between them ( 21.4  s ) pointed us toward a pattern with an average period spacing of 21.2  s. we are confident that @xmath9 modes found in future observations of pg  0122 will conform to this pattern and not to one based on 16.1  s.",
    "the period spacing between @xmath9 modes constrains the global properties of pg  0122 .",
    "to determine these properties , we computed evolutionary stellar models with masses between 0.56 and 0.66 m@xmath58 , over a range of effective temperatures from 140,000  k down to 70,000  k , using the stellar evolution code isuevo .",
    "details concerning this code can be found in dehner ( 1995 ) and dehner & kawaler ( 1995 ) . the helium layer thickness in all the models was the same as that of the best model found by kawaler & bradley ( 1994 ) for pg  1159 .",
    "since there are not enough consecutive modes in pg  0122 to attempt a separate determination of the helium layer thickness , and since this parameter has only a very slight effect on the period spacing in the models anyway ( kawaler & bradley 1994 ) , an order  of  magnitude estimate is sufficient for the present analysis .    using the same techniques as kawaler & bradley ( 1994 ) and kawaler et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we directly compared the periods of each model to those found in the star .",
    "the best fit model ( in a least  squares sense ) has a mass of @xmath59 , but a systematic residual exists in the fit .",
    "therefore we caution against taking this value too seriously until more careful modeling can be done .",
    "the model with the best - fitting periods has an average period spacing of 21.6  s.    by varying both the model mass and temperature , many models are found which do match the period spacing of pg  0122 .",
    "figure  6 shows the region of the log(g)log(@xmath60 ) plane occupied by the models",
    ". a linear fit to the @xmath35 periods in pg  0122 yields a final spacing @xmath61  s. the solid line in the figure indicates the interpolated position of models which satisfy this condition",
    ". we would like of course to reduce the range of possibilities from a line to a point .",
    "this suggests a two parameter fit to the periods ( of both the star and the models ) of the form @xmath62 where both @xmath57 and @xmath63 are free parameters .",
    "this is simply the asymptotic period equation derived using a wkb analysis , familiar from standard stellar pulsation theory ( c.f .",
    "unno et al .",
    "though @xmath63 does not represent any obvious physical quantity , its value is set by the input physics and by the equilibrium stellar structure .",
    "this is apparent since we found that the fit of the periods to equation [ 4 ] for every model , over the entire range of masses and temperatures mentioned above , gives essentially the @xmath64 value of @xmath63 , ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "this method of model comparison has the advantage that both @xmath57 and @xmath63 are evaluated as an average over several modes , and therefore are affected only slightly by changes in the helium layer thickness , even when only a few modes are used ( as long as the periods span several trapping cycles ) .",
    "we find with this analysis that none of the models adequately reproduce @xmath63 as measured in the stars themselves with sufficient accuracy to distinguish them from one another , and therefore all models with the correct period spacing  regardless of the periods themselves ",
    "represent equivalent fits to the power spectrum of pg  0122 .",
    "put another way , it was not possible to find a satisfactory and unique model which reproduced the periods and the mean spacing simultaneously .",
    "we are reduced to using the spectroscopic temperature to eliminate some models from consideration .",
    "the area of the h ",
    "r diagram where the correct range of period spacing intersects the allowed temperature region is indicated by the parallelogram in figure  6 .",
    "since this area falls outside the range of available models , the final mass was found by extrapolating both the 21.21  s line and the model masses .",
    "the mass of pg  0122 thus falls in the range 0.66 to 0.72  @xmath1 . until models with the same period spacing",
    "can be distinguished from one another ( using @xmath63 or some other parameter ) , no independent estimate of the effective temperature ( and therefore of the luminosity and distance ) can be given .",
    "we are preparing a paper which describes the details of this method of model comparison and its application to other pg  1159 stars .",
    "one final point should be made concerning the power spectrum of pg  0122 .",
    "this is the third pre  white dwarf star , out of three studied in detail so far , with a period spacing near 21.5  s. why the mass and temperature should conspire , over a large range of both quantities , to give the same period spacing in all three stars is a mystery .",
    "perhaps this value for @xmath57 is also a condition for pulsation ?",
    "we intend to explore the implications of these results for the instability strip occupied by the pg  1159 stars .",
