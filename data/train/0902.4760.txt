    "quantum game theory has been extensively studied by a number of authors in the last few years [ 4 - 6 ] .",
    "the role of the initial quantum state entanglement is an interesting feature in quantum games .",

    "the prisoner s dilemma is a widely known example in classical game theory .",
    "the study of multi - player quantum games could be of great importance from both a theoretical and a practical point of view and can exhibit interesting results in comparison to two player games .",
    "a model of two player prisoner s dilemma quantum game was developed by eisert @xcite in which the paradox in the classical prisoner s dilemma was solved in a maximally entangled state .",

    "the game is symmetric for the three players , and the strategy ( @xmath10 dominates the strategy ( @xmath11 for all the three players . since the selfish players prefer to choose ( @xmath10 as optimal strategy , the unique nash equilibrium is ( @xmath12 ) with payoffs ( @xmath13 ) .",
