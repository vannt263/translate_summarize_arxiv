    "in the recent years there is a remarkable progress in the technology of the nanofabrication of well defined magnetic materials .",
    "the material nanoscience based on the epitaxial and lithographic techniques @xcite allows the fabrication of the regular arrays of the magnetic particles - dots of well controlled and interesting shape @xcite , lattice geometry and composition .",
    "the increasing technological flexibility calls for further physical ideas , which should be incorporated into design of the artificial nanoscale magnetic systems .",
    "the uniformity of the polarization is the general basic aspect discussed in the connection with the small magnetic particles .",
    "the concept of uniformly polarized particle is justified only for the particles of an intermediate size @xcite . in the theory",
    "@xcite the magnetostatic coupling was derived for the homogeneously polarized and saturated cylindrical dots on a rectangular lattice .",
    "more restrictive are conditions of the simulation @xcite , where each dot of array is substituted by a single dipolar moment .",
    "this approximation can be used only for monodomain dots separated by a sufficiently large distances . when a dot array is represented by a system of the interacting dipoles , the search for the ground state configuration leads to the formulation typical for the classical dipolar lattices @xcite .",
    "the violation of the intradot homogeneity stems from the competition between the magnetostatic , anisotropy and exchange energy terms .",
    "the analytical model of the dot array going towards the non - uniformity was proposed in @xcite . in this model",
    "the interactions of dots were described by the quadrupolar terms .",
    "the problem of the calculation of the magnetization field of a dot array can be in principal formulated in the terms of classical micromagnetic theory @xcite .",
    "due to complexity of the problem , the important role in its treatment will play the numerical simulations .",
    "they require the implementation of the sufficiently dense discretization within the each ferromagnetic dot . as usual ,",
    "the magnetic part of the system can be subdivided into interacting dipoles or grains @xcite , small ferromagnetic cubes @xcite or finite elements @xcite .",
    "then the optimum spacing of the mesh nodes is determined by a minimum magnetic length scale ( exchange , wall ) of the system . for the majority of ferromagnetic materials ,",
    "the comprehensive micromagnetic description is attained when the size of discretization elements decreases into the nanometer regime @xcite .",
    "thus , the simulation of a single ultrathin dot of the micrometer size requires about @xmath2 nodes , although , the qualitative simulations can be realized even for @xmath3 nodes @xcite . from this",
    "we can conclude that both detailed and truncated micromagnetic description of many - dot array represents rather demanding computational task .",
    "we summarize , that principal difficulties of micromagnetic dot array analysis come from : ( i )  the interplay of the phenomena on the intradot ( exchange , domain wall ) and external geometric length scales ; ( ii )  complexity of the magnetic structure of the non - uniformly polarized dots ; ( iii )  long - range magnetostatic interdot interactions .    to make the problem of the magnetic ordering of dot arrays tractable by a moderate computer facilities , we have developed method , which works on a much coarser mesh than usual discretization schemes allow ( except the adaptive and multigrid methods ) .",
    "its general idea is the simultaneous simulation of the intradot - micromagnetic and multidot scales .",
    "this idea was strongly inspired by the multiscale approach @xcite . at the present stage of the project ,",
    "the multidot part of simulation has been developed separately and the behaviour of the small - intradot scales has been treated only phenomenologically .",
    "the approach allows a remarkable increase of the simulation speed , indeed , the price payed to the scale separation is the appearance of additional parameters .",
    "the completing of the project needs support of the algorithms of the parameter estimation developed on the basis of the standard micromagnetic simulations .",
    "let us to note that similar problems were solved in a cellular automaton version of the molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "in this paper we presented the results of the simulation of magnetic properties of quasi - two - dimensional cluster of ultra - thin magnetic dots on the square lattice .",
    "the phenomenological aspect of our model is a variable intradot inhomogeneity .",
    "the formalism we developed for this aim has been adopted from the models of the neural networks .    from the point of view of the information theory ,",
    "the neural networks are continuous , unique mappings constructed from the system of known activation functions .",
    "the synaptic weights of these activation functions are adjusted by the training process .",
    "the standard problem , which can be effectively solved by the neural networks is the association of the input patterns ( in our case inputs are effective magnetic moments ) with the desired outputs ( magnetic self - energy of dot ) .",
    "there are many applications , where neural networks can be implemented .",
    "they allow interpolation of the data generated by the simulations or experiment .",
    "the example of the physical application is @xcite , where neural network was used to fit a complicated analytic potential to the set of ab initio data . in @xcite ,",
    "the hopfield type of the interaction matrix was suggested to simulate the dynamics of the complex protein molecule .",
    "the specific magnetic application represents the solution of the magnetic inverse problem @xcite .    for the purpose to model the variable magnetic intradot inhomogeneity we adopted the theory of the radial basis function networks ( rbfn ) @xcite .",
    "the rbfn variant of the neural network was chosen , because its ingredient is a straightforward and explicit estimation of the synaptic weights , which allows more transparent analysis of the physical symmetries .",
    "the aim of the paper is to make general presentation of the model and present some numerical results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ modell ] the model of the dot array energy functional is introduced .",
    "this section consists of two parts : in subsection  [ model0 ] we introduced the general phenomenological concept of the nonuniform magnetization , which utilizes self - energy interpolation by means of rbfn approach . in subsection  [ model1 ] the interaction between dots is introduced . in section  [ square ]",
    "our method is applied to the ultrathin square dots , where tendency of the formation of the vortex intradot phase prevails .",
    "section  [ simull ] provides some details about the implementation of the simulated annealing algorithm to the problem of the total energy minimization .",
    "finally , in section  [ numsimull ] we bring examples of the numerical simulations .",
    "the microstate of the system of @xmath4 magnetic dots is described by @xmath5 effective magnetic moments @xmath6 which are associated with the magnetization field of dot @xmath7 via the volume averages @xmath8 the formal integration is performed here over @xmath9th volume element of @xmath10th dot labeled as @xmath11 .",
    "the saturation magnetic moment @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the saturation magnetization of the dot , plays role of the normalization factor in eq.([eqqq1 ] ) .",
    "thus for the effective magnetic moments we have the bounding @xmath14 where @xmath15 @xmath16 subscripts refer to the cartesian components of the effective magnetic moments @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the cartesian unit vectors .",
    "the `` softness '' of @xmath20 expressed by eq.([bounds ] ) is the important model aspect , which differs from the fundamental brown s postulate @xcite .",
    "the reason for this modification is that our model is formulated for sufficiently larger elements than classical micromagnetic approach .",
    "the total magnetization per dot per interaction center is given by @xmath21 the effective moments characterizing @xmath10th dot inside @xmath4-cluster are distributed around the dot center @xmath22 and located at @xmath23 positions @xmath24 where @xmath25 are some relative coordinates of the interaction centers . from the assumption that identical dots are arranged into array it follows that system of @xmath25 vectors is independent of the dot position inside the cluster .    in a quasi - two dimensional systems , where @xmath20 is confined to @xmath26 plane , reduced information about @xmath10th dot microstate",

    "the intradot self - energy is understood as a part of the total energy , which includes only anisotropy , exchange and intradot magnetostatic energy contributions .",
    "the zeeman term and interdot magnetostatic terms , which do not contribute to the self - energy are defined independently of the neural network part of the model .",
    "the construction of the self - energy formula @xmath29 is based on a proper choice of the set of special @xmath30-dimensional memorized vectors ( the input patterns of neural networks ) of the type eq.([moments01 ] ) .",

    "written here for some magnetic moment @xmath37 [ again encoded via the rule from eq.([moments01 ] ) ] .",
    "the superscript @xmath38 from eq.([metrix ] ) denotes the vector transposition .",
    "we start the construction of @xmath29 by assuming that self - energy is known for @xmath39 memorized vectors @xmath40 where @xmath41 are free parameters of our model .",
    "the quality of the interpolation via rbfn depends on the choice of the basis functions and corresponding weights .",
    "most convenient for our preliminary purposes seems to be the use of nadaraya - watson regression estimator @xcite . according to this ,",
    "the self - energy input - output relation can be written @xmath42 where @xmath43 are radial basis functions @xmath44 , @xmath45 satisfying the normalization conditions @xmath46 the dot index of @xmath37 was omitted whenever the distinctions between the individual dots is unimportant .",

    "having established the formula for the calculation of the self - energy , it is easy to prove that if the systems of the memorized vectors is composed from the conjugate vector pairs @xmath52 , @xmath53 with the same self - energy parameters @xmath54 rbfn self - energy form including the typical combination of terms @xmath55 posses the reflection symmetry @xmath56 to analyze the configuration snapshots generated during the simulation process we have introduced so called feature map @xmath57 .",
    "it associates any pattern vector @xmath37 with the feature @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the feature @xmath59 identifies the index of a nearest memorized vector @xmath60 : @xmath61 the classification of the features performed for the whole cluster gives rise to the @xmath62component vector @xmath63 .",
    "the information about this vector can be concentrated to the form of the sample averages @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the usual kronecker symbol .",
    "the standard assumption about the interdot interactions is that they are essentially magnetostatic @xcite . by using the concept of the effective moments and interaction centers one can construct easily the interdot interaction potential . for this aim",
    "we expressed the energy contribution @xmath66 consisting of the dipole - dipole interactions of the effective moment @xmath20 [ located at the @xmath9th center of @xmath10th dot at the position @xmath67 with @xmath23 effective moments of @xmath68th dot ( @xmath69 ) @xmath70 where @xmath71 because @xmath72 , @xmath73 are scaled by the lattice spacing @xmath74 , the energy dimension is absorbed into dipolar constant @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the relative permeability of the matrix .",
    "for the interdot magnetostatic energy of dot pair @xmath77 we obtain the expression @xmath78 the key remaining contribution is the zeeman energy . for @xmath10th dot interacting with the external magnetic field @xmath79",
    "we obtain @xmath80 in further , to characterize the external field , we have used the reduced undimensional field @xmath81 , its components @xmath82 @xmath83 , @xmath84@xmath85 and polar angle @xmath86 .",
    "the final form of total energy functional is then given by @xmath87 the schematic view on its structure is displayed in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "according to the scheme of the computation , the interacting dots have their counterpart in the interacting rbfn blocks .",

    "direct model improvement is possible in many ways : a )  near dot interactions can be taken into account more accuratelly by including the rectangle - rectangle magnetostatic terms ; b )  to speed - up the computations and to extend the system size one can use the hierarchical summation @xcite .",
