    "the model is quite general , and the rationale and good performance of the model are detailed in chapter 9 of @xcite .",
    "even though only partial solution of the model as `` integral equations '' has been provided in @xcite or @xcite , neither the mathematical properties of the model nor how the individual agents growth rates that are tied by the model should behave has been analyzed .",
    "further , the induced model for business cycles has not been analyzed mathematically .",
