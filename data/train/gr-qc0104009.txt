    "campbell showed the theorem that any solution of the einstein equations in @xmath0 dimensions can be locally embedded in a ricci - flat manifold of @xmath1 dimensions whose field equations in terms of the ricci tensor are @xmath2 ( @xmath3).@xmath4 tavakol and coworkers have recently noted the relevance of this to the embedding of lower - dimensional ( possibly quantizeable ) gravity in 4d einstein gravity,@xmath5 and the technique is clearly applicable to the recovery of solutions of 4d general relativity from 10d superstrings , 11d supergravity and m - theory.@xmath6 a major application of campbell s theorem is to induced - matter theory , wherein solutions of the 4d einstein equations with matter are recovered from the 5d kaluza - klein equations in apparent vacuum.@xmath7 this approach has been applied to cosmology,@xmath8 clusters of galaxies@xmath9 and the solar system,@xmath10 where there is agreement with observational data .",
    "it is valuable in application to general relativity , since solutions of the kaluza - klein equations can yield new solutions of the einstein equations . with regard to the latter",
    ", spherically - symmetric sources such as stars can be modelled in the simplest way by the interior and exterior schwarzschild solutions . but to include the radiation outside a star , more complicated solutions are required.@xmath11 these include the vaidya metric which uses a retarded time coordinate to describe a radiating atmosphere,@xmath12 the metrics of herrera and coworkers wherein spheres of matter are matched to exterior spacetimes,@xmath13 and the metrics of glass and krisch which extend the vaidya solution to include both a radiation field and a string fluid.@xmath14 however , despite extensive work on star - like solutions of the 4d equations and the existence of campbell s theorem which shows that such can be embedded in the @xmath15d equations , not much work has been done on spherically - symmetric solutions of the 5d equations .",
    "notable exceptions are solutions which have an isothermal equation of state in 4d@xmath9 and ones which are flat in 5d but curved in 4d.@xmath16 we will therefore present an analysis of a class of 5d metrics , and illustrate their relevance by isolating two 4d solutions .",
    "one describes a source with the stiff equation of state believed to be applicable to dense astrophysical objects , and the other describes a spherical source with radiation .",
    "in this section we let upper - case latin indices run 0 - 4 and lower - case greek indices run 0 - 3 . we absorb the speed of light and the gravitational constant through the choices of units @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath18 . the coordinates are @xmath19 with @xmath20 with ( 3d ) spherical symmetry .",
    "consider the 5d line element with interval @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    ".. this metric is broad in scope and has been used in other contexts.@xmath24 it also has the advantage that the 5d field equations @xmath2 break down neatly into a set involving the 4d ricci tensor and a conservation - type equation for the scalar field @xmath25 :    @xmath26    here @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 in ( 3 ) is made of @xmath30 .",
    "equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) admit many different types of solution , but here we choose a time - dependent scalar field and a static 4d geometry :    @xmath31    these require that the lhs of ( 3 ) should be independent of @xmath32 and the rhs of ( 3 ) should be independent of @xmath33 .",
    "therefore both sides should equal to a constant , say , @xmath34 .",
    "so we must have @xmath35 substituting this into equation ( 4 ) , we find that ( 4 ) is satisfied .",
    "using ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) in ( 3 ) gives the non - vanishing components    @xmath36    with @xmath37 .",
    "these are three equations in two unknowns , and determine a class of solutions which is time - dependent in 5d via ( 7 ) but static in 4d and spherically symmetric in 3d .",
    "let us manipulate ( 8)-(10 ) .",
    "the sum of @xmath38 of ( 8) and @xmath39 of ( 9 ) gives    @xmath40    and we can rewrite ( 10 ) as    @xmath41    using ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) , we verify that ( 8) and ( 9 ) are satisfied .",
    "therefore , we need to solve ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) for @xmath42 and @xmath43 . now",
    "( 12 ) can be written as @xmath44 . integrating this we get    @xmath45 \\quad .\\ ] ]    substituting this into ( 11 ) , we obtain    @xmath46 \\quad .\\ ] ]    without loss of generality , let us introduce a mass function@xmath47 via    @xmath48    then ( 14 ) becomes @xmath49 \\quad .\\ ] ] here @xmath50 is a fiducial radius that can be chosen as appropriate to a physical situation .",
    "thus if @xmath51 we expect to recover the schwarzschild case .",
    "the latter is indeed recovered for @xmath52 , when @xmath53 constant and ( 13 ) reads    @xmath54 = 1-\\frac{2m}r\\;\\;.\\ ] ]    that is , @xmath52 specifies the schwarzschild limit of a class of solutions determined by ( 16 ) and one or the other of ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) .",
    "we can study close - to - schwarzschild approximation by expanding the mass function @xmath55 of ( 15 ) for @xmath56 small ( i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "thus we write    @xmath58    with @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 is the zero - order approximation of @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the first - order approximation , and so on . to obtain @xmath63 we substitute @xmath60 for @xmath61 in the rhs of ( 16 ) to obtain @xmath64 .",
    "integrating @xmath65 gives @xmath66 .",
    "then we substitute @xmath62 for @xmath61 in the rhs of ( 16 ) to obtain @xmath67 . in this way",
    "we obtain the following recursion formulae for evaluating @xmath68 : @xmath69   \\nonumber \\\\ & & ..............   \\nonumber \\\\ \\mu _",
    "n^{\\prime } & = & -\\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\\mu _ m^{\\prime } + \\frac 32\\lambda ^2r\\left ( r-2\\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\\mu _ m\\right ) .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\exp \\left\\ { 2\\int_{r_0}^r\\left [ \\frac 1r-\\left ( r-2\\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\\mu _ m\\right ) ^{-1}\\right ] dr\\right\\ } \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this we find    @xmath70    and so    @xmath71    in the region @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we find    @xmath74    where we have absorbed a constant term in @xmath60 without loss of generality , so the first - order approximation of @xmath75 in ( 15 ) is    @xmath76    substituting this equation into ( 13 ) , keeping only terms up to first order in @xmath77 as well as in @xmath78 , and neglecting a constant factor in @xmath43 , we find    @xmath79    from this coefficient and that of ( 23 ) we obtain the first order close - to - schwarzschild approximation of the 5d solution as @xmath80 -e^{-4\\lambda t}dy^2.\\ ] ] this metric is time - dependent .",
    "when @xmath81 , it tends to the 5d schwarzschild solution .",
    "so we call ( 25 ) the close - to - schwarzschild approximation for small @xmath82 implying that the time - variation of the field should be very slow .",
    "we also find that the solution ( 25 ) belongs to the type d class of the general time - dependent 5d metrics.@xmath83 as regards the 4d part inside the square bracket in ( 25 ) , it is interesting to note that it does define the 4d schwarzschild - de sitter solution . in the latter , @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "both contain a term @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the cosmological constant .",
    "by contrast , whereas @xmath77 has the same physical dimensions as @xmath85 ( namely @xmath86 or @xmath87 ) , @xmath42 and @xmath43 in ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) contain terms with different signs and different sizes .",
    "this situation is analogous to another in kaluza - klein theory , where the exact solution of the 5d field equations for a charged point mass does not exactly reproduce the 4d reissner - nordstrom solution.@xmath88 since the 5d equations are richer than the 4d ones , such situations may be expected ; but even so , ( 25 ) defines a new solution .",
    "there are , of course , many other solutions than those which are close to schwarzschild . in general",
    ", we have a class of solutions of @xmath2 with a metric    @xmath89 -e^{-4\\lambda t}dy^2\\ ] ]    whose spacetime potentials @xmath90 are determined by ( 11),(12 ) .",
    "alternatively , they are determined by ( 16 ) and one or the other of ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) .",
    "we should recall , however , that while ( 8) , ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) are 4d relations and can be used as such , the class of metrics ( 26 ) is 5d in nature .",
    "this means that we can use campbell s theorem@xmath4 and the induced - matter formalism@xmath7 to generate 4d solutions of einstein s equations with their appropriate matter .",
    "we now proceed to show how the 5d metric ( 26 ) produces two exact 4d solutions .",
    "the first is obtained by splitting off the part inside square brackets in ( 26 ) .",
    "the 4d metric is then    @xmath91    and is static .",
    "we therefore expect that the source necessary to balance einstein s equations will also be static .",
    "as mentioned above , the kaluza - klein equations @xmath92 contain as a subset the einstein equations @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) . here",
    "@xmath95 is the 4d energy - momentum tensor , which can always be constructed from the 5d geometry@xmath96 and whose form is now well known.@xmath97 for the present case , @xmath98 is given by ( 3 ) , so the induced energy - momentum tensor is    @xmath99    using ( 7 ) and ( 27 ) , we find that the non - vanishing components of this in mixed form are    @xmath100    this as expected represents a static source , which we can model as a perfect fluid with    @xmath101    here @xmath102 is the density , @xmath103 is the pressure and the 4-velocity is @xmath104 . combining ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) , we see that the source has    @xmath105    this is the stiff equation of state in which the speed of sound waves approaches the speed of light , and has been applied in previous studies@xmath106 to astrophysical situations such as collapsed stars and proto - galactic fluctuations .      the second solution we look at is obtained by splitting off the whole of the first part of ( 26 ) .",
    "the 4d metric is then    @xmath107 , \\ ] ]    and is time - dependent .",
    "we therefore expect that the source necessary to balance einstein s equations will also be time - dependent .",
    "it should be noted that this property can not in general be removed by a coordinate transformation based on birkhoffsss theorem , because the 4d metric ( 32 ) will have a source constructed from the 5d geometry that will in general not be vacuum ; and because the 4d metric ( 32 ) is part of a 5d metric ( 26 ) and it is known that birkhoff s theorem in its standard form breaks down in the transition from 4d to 5d,@xmath108 as evidenced by the existence of both static and time - dependent soliton solutions.@xmath109 to investigate the time - dependence of ( 32 ) , let us make the coordinate transformation    @xmath110    this brings ( 32 ) into the form    @xmath111    we can use this with @xmath112 to evaluate the induced matter properties using the standard technique.@xmath97 we note that    @xmath113    which can be used to form the induced energy - momentum tensor :    @xmath114    the non - vanishing components of this in mixed form are    @xmath115    we see from ( 38 ) that the density is inhomogeneous via @xmath116 and is time - dependent , as is the pressure by ( 39 ) though the latter is isotropic .",
    "we also see from ( 40 ) that there is an off - diagonal component .",
    "the latter can be accommodated by introducing a two - fluid model    @xmath117    which as in other work@xmath118 we take to be the sum of a perfect fluid and a radial heat flow :    @xmath119    the heat - flux vector and the 4-velocity must obey the orthogonality condition    @xmath120    this we satisfy by taking    @xmath121    where in ( 45 ) we have used the facts that @xmath33 is a comoving coordinate and that the 4-velocities are normalized via @xmath122 . substituting ( 45 ) , ( 46 ) into ( 42 ) , ( 43 ) and these into ( 41 ) gives the non - vanishing components of the last in mixed form :    @xmath123    comparing these with ( 38 ) , ( 39 ) , ( 40 ) gives us the density , pressure and heat flow in explicit form :    @xmath124    the equation of state is that of radiation or ultra - relativistic matter , and has been applied in previous studies@xmath125 to astrophysical situations such as fermion soliton stars and the early universe .",
    "we have taken a 5d metric ( 1 ) which contains a 4d sub - metric ( 6 ) whose 3d part is spherically symmetric .",
    "an expansion in the metric coefficient allows us to recover the schwarzschild case of general relativity in ( 17 ) as the zeroth approximation and a close - to - schwarzschild case in ( 25 ) as the first order approximation to a class of spherically - symmetric solutions .",
    "any solution of the 5d kaluza - klein equations in apparent vacuum can be written as a solution of the 4d einstein equations with matter .",
    "two solutions have then been shown , with matter properties corresponding to those of a stiff fluid ( 31 ) , and radiation or ultra relativistic particles with heat flow ( 50,51 ) .",
    "these solutions can be applied to astrophysics , but are merely illustrative examples .    in the wider scheme ,",
    "it is clear that ( local ) embedding theorems are powerful tools , whether applied to @xmath126 ( possibly quantizeable ) gravity,@xmath5 4d einstein theory,@xmath11 5d kaluza - klein theory,@xmath127 or 10d superstrings , 11d supergravity and m - theory.@xmath6 campbell s theorem ensures that any solution in  nd can be embedded in a ricci - flat solution in @xmath128 .@xmath4 the schwarzschild solution in 4d can of course be embedded in a flat space of @xmath129 .@xmath130 and any solution in 4d can be embedded in a flat space of @xmath131 @xmath132 .@xmath133 the implications of embedding theorems are diverse",
    ". if the aim is to find new solutions of general relativity , the higher - dimensional field equations are often surprisingly tractable , and the method of reduction to 4d is straightforward.@xmath5 if the aim is to give meaning to higher - dimensional theories , the same method of reduction will inform about physicality in the 4d world .",
    "we should recall that field equations like those of einstein or kaluza - klein allow the dimensionality to be freely chosen , which should be done partly with a view to what physics it is desired to describe and partly with a view to what technical constraints are involved . in the latter regard , it is well known that @xmath126 theories run into problems of formulation which are connected with the degenerate nature of lower - dimensional riemannian spaces . for @xmath134 theories ,",
    "problems arise with the physics if the spaces are subject to arbitrary technical constraints.@xmath135 our opinion , therefore , is that future work should be focussed on higher - dimensional , fully covariant theory .",
