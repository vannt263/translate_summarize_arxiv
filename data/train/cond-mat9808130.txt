    "fortunately , mathematics has provided us with a framework into which we can place this problem : finite - differences and their continuous analogy , differential equations .    in the present paper , we shall be concerned with algorithms for solving second - order ordinary differential equations of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes a scalar or vector position , and dots indicate derivatives with respect to time . in particular , we are concerned with determining the motion of a system of particles moving according to the dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) computational fluid model@xcite ( see section  [ dpd ] ) . the large number of equations and their non - linear nature make direct analytic mathematical solution infeasible , leaving numerical solution by finite - differences as the most appropriate approach .",
    "the forces in our computational fluid model are unusual in that they have a stochastic component , which depends on the size of the timestep in our finite - difference algorithm .",

    "( [ ode ] ) can be found in textbooks on numerical analysis , @xcite and in papers and texts on molecular dynamics and related computational methods .",
    "@xcite algorithms from numerical analysis textbooks are usually unsuitable for our purpose because of the unstable nature of the motion of a many - body system , or an assumption that the forces do not depend on the timestep .",
    "most of the other algorithms we find assume conservative forces , i.e.  @xmath2 .    throughout this paper",
    ", we use the notation @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the value of a variable ( vector or scalar ) at successive timesteps , where @xmath5 is the timestep width .",
    "variables with tildes denote temporary quantities , vectors are in bold , and matrices are in a sans serif font .",
    "hoogerbrugge and koelman proposed dpd@xcite as a novel particulate model for the simulation of complex fluid behavior .",
    "this model is particularly well - suited to model multiphase flows , flow in porous media , colloidal suspensions,@xcite microemulsions , and polymeric fluids.@xcite the traditional approach of continuum fluid mechanics has met with limited success , and so many new micro- and mesoscopic approaches have been considered . in principle , molecular dynamics ( md ) is the most accurate microscopic approach , although in practice it is too slow in both its quantum ( car - parinello ) and classical forms because of its excessive detail .",
    "discrete methods developed from lattice - gas automata ( lga ) have had some success , but they too have problems , such as lacking galilean invariance.@xcite    dpd was developed in an attempt to capture the best aspects of md and lga .",
    "it avoids the lattice - based problems of lga , yet maintains an elegant simplicity and larger scale that keeps the model much faster than md .",
    "this simplicity also makes dpd highly extensible , such as for including the interactions of complex molecules or modeling flow in an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions .",
    "the key features of the basic model are that the fluid is grouped into packets , termed `` particles '' , and that mass and momentum are conserved but energy is not .",
    "particle positions and momenta are real variables , and are not restricted to a grid .",
    "there are two sequential steps to the action of the original model proposed by hoogerbrugge and koelman:@xcite ( i ) an infinitesimally - short impulse step @xmath6 and ( ii ) a propagation step taking time @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the momentum and position of particle @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the unit vector pointing from particle @xmath13 to particle @xmath11 , @xmath14 is the mass of each particle , and @xmath15\\ ] ] within the cut - off radius @xmath16 .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 denotes the distance separating particles @xmath11 and @xmath13 , and @xmath18 is the mass density ; note also that the normalization given is correct only in two dimensions .",
    "the random variable @xmath19 represents the conservative and stochastic effect of the collisions and gives rise to fluid pressure , while the second , dissipative , term inside the square brackets yields fluid viscosity .",
    "espaol and warren s analysis@xcite showed that the original dpd model does not satisfy detailed balance , so the equilibrium states ( if they exist ) can not be simply characterized .",
    "detailed balance is the condition equating the rates of forward and backward transition probabilities in a dynamical system , and is a sufficient ( but not necessary ) condition guaranteeing that the system has a ( gibbsian ) equilibrium state.@xcite espaol and warren formulated a fokker - planck equation and equivalent set of stochastic differential equations which lead to a similar model , @xmath20 \\smallskip\\cr      d{\\bf x}_i = { \\displaystyle { \\bf p}_i \\over\\displaystyle m_i }      dt .       } \\ ] ] in these equations , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath21 denote the momentum , position , and mass of particle @xmath11 , and @xmath22 is a conservative force acting between particles @xmath11 and @xmath13 while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the dissipative and random forces ; @xmath25 are independent increments of a wiener process . by it calculus @xmath26 and",
    "so @xmath27 is an infinitesimal of order @xmath28 and we can write @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a random variable with zero mean and unit variance.@xcite with an appropriate choice for the form of the forces we find detailed balance is satisfied by this continuous - time version of dpd,@xcite and so equilibrium states are guaranteed to exist and be gibbsian . to ensure that the associated fluctuation - dissipation theorem holds , the forces assume the following forms:@xcite @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the difference in velocities of particles @xmath13 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the unit vector pointing from particle @xmath13 to particle @xmath11 , and @xmath35 is a weighting function depending only on the distance separating particles @xmath11 and @xmath13 . the constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are chosen to reflect the relative importance of the conservative , dissipative ( viscous ) , and random components in the fluid of interest .",

    "( [ fc])([fr ] ) , the total force is @xmath44 \\omega_{ij } { { \\bf\\hat{e}}_{ij}}.\\ ] ]    in summary , the main changes from the original dpd model are the specification of the motion in terms of differential equations instead of an impulse step followed by coasting ; the separation of the conservative , dissipative , and random forces , with the strength of each being controlled by the new constants @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ; the insertion of an extra factor of @xmath35 in front of the dissipative force ; the specification of the thermodynamic temperature in terms of the model parameters ; and the square root dependence of the random force on size of timestep .    in order to model binary immiscible fluids , we adopt the simplest approach of introducing a new variable , the `` color '' , by analogy with rothman - keller.@xcite when two particles of different color interact we increase the conservative force , thereby increasing the repulsion .",
    "that is , @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are constants with @xmath48 . as for the single - phase dpd fluid",
    ", the navier - stokes equations are obeyed within regions of homogeneity in each of the two immiscible fluids , while detailed balance is preserved , at least in the limit of continuous time.@xcite we would like to emphasize that with the sole exception of the choice of finite - difference algorithm , this model is identical to that used in our most - recently published simulations.@xcite",
    "a good finite - difference method should be fast , stable , accurate , easy to implement , and require little storage . since for most large systems the force evaluation dominates the computation time , the fastest algorithm is the one that evaluates the force the fewest times for a given accuracy . in general , this means that stable methods which allow large time steps are preferable . in this context",
    "we must be careful to distinguish the stability of a method from the stability of the system being studied , as the dynamical systems we wish to study are extremely unstable , with small perturbations growing exponentially.@xcite a stable method will respond better to large sizes of timestep than an unstable method .",
    "the accuracy of an algorithm is difficult to measure in practice because of the extreme instability of our dynamical systems .",
    "practical accuracy is best quantified by requiring a method to give a trajectory in phase space that is physical for the system ( i.e.   similar to that observed in experiments ) , and for which calculated properties of the system are close to their theoretical values .",
    "an idea of the accuracy of a method can also be obtained by considering the local truncation error , expressed in terms of the order of the timestep occurring in the first truncated term of the corresponding taylor series .",
    "because the forces considered are not smooth , low order algorithms may possibly be more accurate than high order algorithms .",
    "what criteria can we use to evaluate the suitability of a method ?",
    "the literature@xcite claims that a good finite - difference method will be area preserving , time reversible , energy conserving , and ergodic .",
    "the first three criteria are closely related .",
    "we need to be careful in distinguishing between the properties of the finite - difference algorithm and those of the system it is solving .",
    "for example , when we describe an algorithm as being time reversible , we are not saying that it corrects or compensates for the lack of time symmetry in a non - conservative system , but rather that when applied to a conservative system this finite - difference algorithm is able to retrace the precise sequence of steps in the backward evolution which it traversed originally in the forward time direction .",
    "a similar confusion may arise when we consider ergodicity .",
    "is this not a property normally associated with the rules of interaction of systems ? what does it mean to say that a finite - difference algorithm is ergodic ? when we describe an algorithm as being ergodic , we mean that an ergodic system updated by this algorithm will still sample the full phase space ; a non - ergodic algorithm updating the same system will not .",
    "we also need to consider the relevance of these four criteria to non - conservative forces .",
    "for example , is there any use in having an algorithm which conserves energy when our dpd interactions conserve only momentum ?",
    "we argue that unnecessary losses are indeed undesirable ; a finite - difference algorithm which loses energy by consistently underestimating velocity would exhibit lower temperature than a similar algorithm which does not .",
    "an algorithm which preserves the volume of phase space will have a unit jacobian for the transformation of variables from one timestep to the next .",
    "time reversibility can also be checked analytically ( ignoring for the moment the properties of the forces ) .",
    "energy conservation normally follows from time reversibility , but it can also be verified for a conservative system , such as the ( one - dimensional ) simple harmonic oscillator @xmath49 where the total energy is @xmath50 .",
    "ergodicity can be checked by calculating the equilibrium temperature and pressure of an homogeneous fluid , and comparing the velocity distribution with a normal ( gaussian ) distribution.@xcite as this is not a sufficient condition , in the present paper we also simulate a binary immiscible fluid using each of the algorithms , testing laplace s law and comparing the rate of growth of domains with the extensive experimental and theoretical literature , and with our earlier simulations@xcite using the standard dpd finite - difference algorithm ( see section  [ euler ] ) .",
    "it has also been noted in dpd simulations of an ideal gas ( i.e.   @xmath51 ) using this algorithm that the radial pair - correlation function differs from the theoretical result.@xcite a good finite - difference algorithm would remove this inconsistency , so we verify this as well .",
    "for molecular dynamics simulations , the literature recommends either one of the verlet schemes or a multi - value predictor - corrector.@xcite runge - kutta and extrapolation methods are considered unsuitable because they typically require a large number of force evaluations per timestep , which is inefficient for a many - particle system . for the same reason , methods which consider the second order differential equation directly are usually preferred to methods which break it into two first order equations .",
    "we do not consider implicit methods ( in which a variable appears on both sides of a single equation ) since they are computationally infeasible for any system large enough to be of interest .",
    "this is so because the simplest implicit method for a system of @xmath52 particles requires solution of @xmath52 interdependent linear equations taking o(@xmath53 ) operations,@xcite compared with the o(@xmath52 ) operations of an explicit method .",
    "the need to solve these interdependent equations also makes implicit methods much more complicated than explicit methods . however , where the differential equations are very stiff ( have several greatly differing time scales ) the greatly - increased algorithmic stability could outweigh the disadvantages .",
    "having had reasonable results with explicit methods , we do not believe our system is so stiff as to require implicit schemes .",
    "we have obtained good results by starting our simulations with all particles at rest , with the initial position of each particle typically selected from a random variable uniformly distributed across the simulation space .",
    "particles are assumed to have been at rest for some time , so prior positions are the same as initial positions , and prior velocities and higher derivatives are all zero . in our notation @xmath3 and @xmath54 ,",
    "the initial conditions at @xmath55 correspond to @xmath56 while negative values of @xmath57 represent values prior to the start of the simulation .",
    "to give an idea of the relative accuracy of each algorithm we report the local truncation error in position as the order of the timestep appearing in the first term omitted from the taylor series .",
    "the original algorithm proposed by hoogerbrugge and koelman@xcite is a modified euler scheme @xmath58 as much research has been published using this area - preserving scheme , @xcite it is important to compare it with the other methods .",
    "the local truncation error is o(@xmath59 ) .      due to the velocity - dependent nature of the force ( eq .  ( [ dpd_force ] ) ) , the traditional o(@xmath60 ) time - reversible velocity - verlet algorithm @xmath61 can not be used .",
    "ferrario@xcite has suggested two modified schemes to get around this problem .",
    "the first is @xmath62 and the second @xmath63 these two o(@xmath60 ) methods are hereafter referred to as ferrario  i ( eq .  ( [ ferrarioi ] ) ) and ferrario  ii ( eq .",
    "( [ ferrarioii ] ) ) respectively .",
    "groot and warren@xcite recently proposed a different velocity estimate for use with the velocity - verlet algorithm .",
    "their method is @xmath64 this is conceptually similar to the leap - frog form of the verlet algorithm , for if @xmath65 the force is evaluated when the positions and velocities are out of phase . a reasonable range for @xmath66 would be from @xmath67 to @xmath68 ;",
    "we consider only @xmath69 and @xmath70 . for conservative forces",
    "( [ gw ] ) reduces to eq .",

    ", we must be careful to choose the appropriate length of timestep for each force evaluation .",
    "gear has proposed a notation for the general class of multi - value predictor - corrector algorithms.@xcite the variables to be stored from step to step are kept in a column vector , usually in either the nordsieck ( @xmath52 ) representation @xmath73 or the force ( @xmath74 ) representation @xmath75 the @xmath52-representation is more convenient for changing timestep and order , while the @xmath74-representation simplifies calculation .",
    "transformation from one representation to the other is straightforward , involving a multiplication by a transformation matrix @xmath76 .",
    "gear claims that transformation from one representation to another does not affect the truncation error or stability of the method , but does affect the round - off error , and amount of computation and storage.@xcite    to take a step forward in time using a predictor - corrector method , we first multiply the column vector @xmath77 with a matrix @xmath78 in an explicit prediction step @xmath79 and then the forces are evaluated at the positions and velocities in this vector , @xmath80 a corrected vector is obtained by adding a multiple of the difference between the predicted and the calculated force to the existing vector @xmath81 it is possible to iterate the force evaluation ( @xmath82 ) and correction ( @xmath83 ) steps after the initial prediction ( @xmath84 ) , leading to a @xmath85 or @xmath86 algorithm .",
    "the subscript @xmath14 denotes each evaluation - correction step from the first ( @xmath87 ) through the last ( @xmath88 , i.e.  @xmath89 ) .",
    "it can be shown that in the limit of a large number of iterations ( @xmath90 ) , these algorithms are time - reversible.@xcite    the predictor matrix @xmath91 is usually chosen to be the pascal triangle matrix @xmath92 ( in the @xmath52-representation ) , which means that eq .",

    "the correction vectors are identical in the @xmath74-representation except that all components beyond the third are zero.@xcite    we would like to consider these two methods further modified by the insertion of a factor @xmath66 ( typically ranging from @xmath67 to @xmath68 ) into the velocity prediction : @xmath97 ( this matrix being for the 4-value method ) . while this predicted value of velocity will be used for the first force evaluation , the taylor - predicted velocity will be used in the correction step and subsequent iterations so that the methods will benefit from the modified velocity estimate and yet will still converge to the correct solution .",

    "in this section we report on our evaluation of the finite difference algorithms in the previous section , our evaluation criteria being briefly outlined in section  [ criteria ] .",
    "we first present the results of the simple evaluations checking conservation of energy and ergodicity , before presenting more extensive results on phase separation and surface tension .",
    "a system consisting of a single simple harmonic oscillator was allowed to evolve for a thousand timesteps from an initial configuration with unit position ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "two sizes of timestep were considered : one tenth and one hundredth the period of the oscillator .",
    "the variation of the energy @xmath50 relative to the initial energy @xmath105 for each of these sets of simulations is shown in tables  [ sho1 ] and  [ sho2 ] respectively ; results are identical for @xmath69 and @xmath70 . where a median and standard deviation are given , the energy varies periodically ; where an exponent is given , the energy grows or decays as @xmath106 . from these tables",
    "we can see that gear-3 ( @xmath107 ) and runge - kutta have an undesirable continual energy loss for both sizes of timestep .",
    "the other gear methods show a periodic variation of energy for the small timestep , but display a long - term energy drift for the large timestep .",
    "both ferrario methods , groot - warren , and hoogerbrugge - koelman only show periodic variation in energy , with hoogerbrugge - koelman showing by far the largest magnitude of variation .",
    "however , none of the other methods include the correct ( unit ) relative energy within the range of their variation , and so we can not conclude that one periodically varying method is significantly better than any other .",
    "two - dimensional dpd systems of 1600 identical particles were allowed to evolve to equilibrium ( roughly @xmath108 ) , and then the temperature @xmath109 and pressure @xmath84 were observed for the same length of time again .",
    "this was repeated three times for each situation from different random initial configurations , and the results averaged .",
    "the exact parameters used in these simulations are shown in table  [ parameters ] .",
    "the units of these parameters are those natural to the dpd simulation ; although no one has yet related them to physical scales of length or time , it is possible to do so if one desires to apply the simulation technique to describe a real fluid .",
    "these particular values were suggested by hoogerbrugge and koelman .    from statistical mechanics , we know that the instantaneous pressure ( @xmath84 ) of a system in terms of the internal virial ( @xmath110 ) and the instantaneous temperature ( @xmath40 ) are given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the physical volume of space , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 indicates vector magnitude .",
    "the thermodynamic pressure and temperature are the time averages of the instantaneous quantities .",
    "because of the work of espaol , warren , and coveney,@xcite we can be sure that a temperature exists and is meaningful , at least in the continuous - time limit .",
    "the pressure was calculated immediately after the final force evaluation in each algorithm ; the temperature was further evaluated using the final values of velocity . at the end of each simulation , the velocity distribution in the @xmath1-direction was examined ; it was statistically indistinguishable from the maxwellian distribution whenever the temperature converged .    with the exception of runge - kutta ,",
    "all the methods converge to correct temperature and pressure as we decrease the timestep .",
    "we believe this error is due to the unusual timestep - dependent nature of the force , because the runge - kutta algorithm divides the motion into two steps of two - thirds and then one - third the total timestep .",
    "of all the algorithms we consider , only the runge - kutta scheme subdivides the timestep .",

    "[ viscosity ] displays the results ; the error bars are the 68% confidence intervals for the mean , equally weighting each of the simulations for each set of parameters .",
    "others have also found discrepancies between theory and simulation , particularly regarding the kinematic contribution to viscosity.@xcite    using the surface tension and viscosity calculated from our simulations , we can estimate the hydrodynamic length @xmath157 to be @xmath158 . during our simulations we observed the typical domain size of the crossover in spinodal decomposition , which we estimate as @xmath159 ( see section  [ sec : sep ] ) .",
    "this length is in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ exponents ] ) , since for length scales much less than @xmath155 we typically see a growth exponent of @xmath121 , while for length scales much larger than @xmath155 we typically see @xmath132 .",
    "although it would be more reassuring if @xmath155 and our observed crossover length were more comparable in size , we must remember that the theory leading to the proposal of these growth exponents@xcite makes assumptions about the underlying growth dynamics which break down in this region .",
    "this leaves us without an accurate theoretical estimate of the characteristic domain size at the crossover .",
    "it has been observed that dpd simulations of an ideal gas ( i.e.   @xmath51 ) using the hoogerbrugge - koelman scheme have unusual structure in the radial pair - correlation function.@xcite since continuous - time dpd satisfies detailed balance,@xcite we expect the radial pair - correlation function to have a constant unit value .",
    "this suggests that a good finite - difference algorithm would not display this unusual structure .    in order to test each of the finite - difference methods under consideration , systems of 40000 identical particles",
    "were evolved ( @xmath51 ) from initially random configurations until they reached equilibrium ( roughly @xmath108 ) , at which point the radial pair - correlation function was calculated .",
    "simulations were performed for each of the finite - difference algorithms , using a timestep of @xmath160 for all methods except ferrario i and ii , and gear-4 ( @xmath70 , @xmath107 ) . these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ gr_0.05 ] .",
    "[ gr_0.01 ] shows the results of the simulations using the ferrario methods and gear-4 with @xmath70 and @xmath107 , for which we used @xmath161 since they are unstable at the larger timestep . for comparison , the gear-3 ( @xmath69 , @xmath107 ) , groot - warren ( @xmath69 ) , and hoogerbrugge - koelman methods were also tested with the smaller timestep ( @xmath162 ) and",
    "so are also shown in fig .",
    "[ gr_0.01 ] . from these figures",
    "we can see that none of the methods are significantly better than the hoogerbrugge - koelman scheme , and three are noticeably worse : gear-3 ( @xmath70 , @xmath107 ) , gear-4 ( @xmath69 , @xmath107 ) , and groot - warren ( @xmath70 ) . decreasing the timestep gives a marked improvement , so that at @xmath161 all the methods capture the expected unit radial pair - correlation function to a good approximation .",
    "the most significant difference between the simulations reported in this paper and those performed previously@xcite is the improved precision of the measured behavior .",
    "we believe this is largely due to changing the discrete - time algorithm from hoogerbrugge - koelman to groot - warren . coupled with its superior performance in the less - rigorous tests ,",
    "we recommend the groot - warren method with @xmath69 and timestep @xmath163 as most suitable for dpd simulations .",
    "the gear-3 algorithm with @xmath69 and @xmath107 is the obvious second choice , as it gave temperature and pressure to nearly the same accuracy as the groot - warren method ( @xmath69 ) , and is stable to a timestep nearly as large .",
    "our only concern in recommending this modified gear algorithm is its poor energy conservation .",
    "we suspect the main limitation to improving the existing algorithms is their inability to properly address the stochastic component of the forces ; there is some literature on brownian dynamics simulations@xcite that may be useful in finding an even better algorithm . compared with the solution of ordinary differential equations ,",
    "the numerical solution of stochastic differential equations is a recent area of mathematics , and one in which much more research is needed.@xcite",
