    "the cern large hardron collider ( lhc ) will lead us to revolutionary discoveries in particle physics . observing the higgs boson(s )",
    "is arguably the most anticipated discovery at the lhc .",
    "once a higgs boson ( @xmath5 ) is observed , a significant part of the lhc program will be focused on determining the properties of it .",
    "one of the most important aspects of the higgs boson interactions will be its cp property .",
    "due to the clear need for new sources of cp violation beyond the standard model ( sm ) to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe , it is conceivable that an extended higgs sector may be a primary source with or without spontaneous cp violation @xcite .",
    "there have been significant efforts in the literature to explore the possibility to observe the effects of cp - violation in the higgs sector at the lhc @xcite .",
    "if the higgs boson is heavy enough to decay to multiple identifiable sm particles , then it is quite feasible to construct cp - odd observables .",
    "examples include @xmath6 or @xmath7 @xcite",
    ". however , if the higgs boson is light and only decays to light fermion pairs , then there will not be enough information for constructing a cp - odd kinematical observable like the triple product using the final state momenta of the higgs decay .",
    "the only exceptions are the subdominant channel @xmath8 , subsequently decaying to at least two charged tracks plus missing neutrinos @xcite , which suffers from a small branching fraction to the identifiable final state and difficulties for event reconstruction .",
    "this may lead us to test the yukawa coupling of @xmath9 . for @xmath10 couplings , one may hope to access the clean decay channel @xmath11 @xcite , if the higgs mass is not too far below @xmath12 .",
    "attempts have also been made to probe the cp property of the @xmath13 coupling at hadron colliders via virtual higgs effects in @xmath14 production @xcite , and via the direct associated production of @xmath15 at the lhc @xcite .",
    "however , it is very challenging to establish the signal of the @xmath13 final state at the lhc experiments @xcite .    in general , it is known to be quite challenging to construct genuine cp - odd observables at the lhc .",
    "first , the initial state of the lhc , as a @xmath16 collider , is not a cp eigenstate , in contrast to the neutrality property of an @xmath17 collider or a @xmath18 collider . as a result",
    ", one may have to seek for neutral subprocesses ( with @xmath19 initial states ) or decays of cp eigenstates at the lhc experiments .",
    "second , even with the initial states @xmath20 and @xmath21 , they form a cp eigenstate only with special spin and color configurations , and in their center - of - mass ( c.m . ) frame which is in general different from the lab frame .",
    "these two reference frames are related by a longitudinal boost that is unknown and different event by event . only with large statistics",
    "would one expect the difference to be averaged out .",
    "furthermore , the symmetric proton beams at the lhc make it impossible to identify the direction of a quark versus an anti - quark on an event - by - event basis , which is often needed to specify a particle versus an anti - particle .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "some genuine cp - odd observables have been proposed suitable for the lhc .",
    "one of them is the difference of the scalar transverse momenta @xcite , or equivalently the transverse energies , @xmath22 where @xmath23 , with superscripts @xmath24 specifying the particle charges .",
    "this observable is cp - odd but @xmath25-even is the naive time - reversal transformation which only flips the sign of momenta and spins , without changing the initial or final states . ] and thus generated from cp - violation associated with the absorptive part of the amplitude @xcite , thus relying on the existence of an additional cp - conserving strong phase @xmath26 .",
    "the other one is a modified triple product @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the 3-momenta of the particle @xmath29 and anti - particle @xmath30 , @xmath31 are their unit vectors , and @xmath32 is the beam direction .",
    "this observable is cp - odd and @xmath25-odd , and may be generated from the dispersive part of the amplitude @xcite .",
    "both variables ( [ teven ] ) and ( [ todd ] ) are independent of the choice of a quark momentum direction and are longitudinally boost invariant , thus adequate for lhc experiments .    in this article",
    ", we address the feasibility of discovering cp violation in @xmath0 interactions using these observables .",
    "we propose to analyze the process @xmath33 where the @xmath34 decays leptonically and the higgs to @xmath35 .",
    "the signal diagram is illustrated in figure [ signaldiagram ] .",
    "feymann diagram of signal process at the parton level @xmath36 .",
    "]    the most general lorentz structure of the higgs and z boson coupling , @xmath37 , is @xmath38 , \\label{eq : operator}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field , and the @xmath34 boson 4-momenta are both incoming .",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath41 terms are cp - even while @xmath42 is cp - odd .",
    "the simultaneous presence of both @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 in this vertex would generate cp - violation . in the sm at tree level , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for a given theory of the sm or beyond , radiative corrections can generate nonzero contributions to @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath45 , and thus each of these are energy - dependent form factors in general @xcite . in effective field theory language , @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be obtained from gauge invariant dimension-6 operators such as @xmath46 respectively @xcite .",
    "depending on the nature of the underlying theory , the effective couplings @xmath47 could be of order unity for a weakly coupled theory , or of order @xmath48 in a strongly coupled theory .",
    "if the theory is valid up to a scale @xmath49 , we expect that @xmath41 and @xmath42 should be of the order @xmath50 to 1 . for our phenomenological studies",
    ", we will simply take them as constants with some optimistic values , and will focus on the complex cp - violating parameter @xmath42 which accommodates both dispersive ( real @xmath42 ) and absorptive ( imaginary @xmath42 ) cp violation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : asymmetry ] , we concentrate on the signal and show that an asymmetry appears in the observables @xmath51 with the above theoretical parameterizations . in sec .  [ sec : reach ] , we consider the backgrounds to this process at the lhc , apply judicial kinematic cuts and determine the integrated luminosity necessary to observe these asymmetries . in sec .  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss our results further . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude .",
    "the cp asymmetries manifest themselves in the distributions of the cp - odd observables @xmath51 as introduced in the previous section .",
    "we find it convenient to introduce @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the azimuthal angle between the two lepton planes @xmath55 and @xmath56 , multiplied by the sign of their logitudinal momenta difference .",
    "our study of the signal is based on a parton - level monte carlo simulation of @xmath57 , incorporating the full spin correlations from the production to the decay .",
    "we use the cteq6.1l parton distribution functions @xcite .",
    "we simulate the lhc @xmath16 collisions at the c.m .  energy @xmath58 tev . at lower c.m .",
    "energies , we would not expect any qualitative change for our asymmetry discussions , although the signal cross section and sm backgrounds will be different .",
    "we first present the total cross - sections for the signal versus higgs mass for @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] .",
    "we see that , for @xmath61 gev , the sm cross section is of order 700 fb and @xmath42 enhances the cross - section by @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) for @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] , we show the signal cross section as a function of @xmath42 for @xmath61 and @xmath66 gev .",
    "there is no decay branching fraction included in these figures .",
    "we use the illustrative value @xmath61 gev in the remainder of this paper .    to simulate geometrical coverage of the detector and for the purpose of triggering , we impose the following basic cuts of transverse momentum , rapidity , and separation on the jets and leptons : @xmath67 with these acceptance cuts , we show the distribution of @xmath68 in fig .  [",
    "fig : signalasy1 ]       for the case @xmath65 ( left panel ) , and the case with @xmath69 ( right panel ) by the dashed histograms .",
    "the sm result is included for comparison by the solid curves in both panels .",
    "we see that the cp asymmetry in @xmath68 is only induced by cp - violation in the dispersive amplitude as in the left panel with real @xmath42 , but not in the absorptive amplitude as in the right panel with imaginary @xmath45 .",
    "in contrast , the distribution of @xmath70 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : signalasy2 ]       with the same parameter choice , and the cp asymmetry in this variable is only induced by cp - violation in the absorptive amplitude in the right panel with imaginary @xmath42 , but not in the dispersive amplitude in the left panel with real @xmath45 .",
    "the asymmetrical distributions in @xmath54 and @xmath71 induced by cp violation leads to nonzero values of the cross - section differences @xmath72 and in the corresponding asymmetries which are conventionally defined as @xmath73 we show the cross - section difference @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) and corresponding asymmetries @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : phibtilde ] ( [ fig : deltaetbtilde ] )    for a range of @xmath78 values .",
    "the cross - section differences may be sizable and could reach about 1 fb for @xmath74 and 0.3 fb for @xmath75 with @xmath79 .",
    "the asymmetry in @xmath76 is typically larger than that in @xmath77 .",
    "we see that the cross - section difference follows a linear - dependence on @xmath80 , while the asymmetries reach their maxima around re@xmath81 and im@xmath81 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "this is an indication that the higher order terms in @xmath78 become significant , and thus care needs to be taken for larger values of @xmath80 when interpreting the results of the asymmetries .",
    "the signals we are searching for are the @xmath82 events as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fs ] ) .",
    "we specify these events with two jets , with at least one @xmath41-tagged , and two opposite - sign leptons of the same flavor , either electron or muon .",
    "contributions to the background mainly come from three sources : @xmath83 these backgrounds are calculated using the calchep package @xcite .",
    "the full spin correlation have been kept for all @xmath84 where the full @xmath85 processes are calculated . in the case of the @xmath14 background ,",
    "@xmath86 events are generated and then decayed , ignoring spin correlation .",
    "since this process is subdominant , the error resulting from loss of spin correlation should not be large .",
    "the processes @xmath84 , where @xmath87 denotes a jet from a light quark ( @xmath88 or @xmath89 ) or gluon , yield large rates due to qcd .",
    "demanding at least one tagged @xmath41-jet substantially reduces this background .",
    "the tagging and mistagging rates we use are taken from figure 12.30 of the cms tdr @xcite , and are listed here in table [ efficiencies ] .",
    "b - quark jet & @xmath90 + c - quark jet & @xmath91 + gluon jet & @xmath92 + light jet & @xmath93 +    the mistagging rates are correlated with the tagging efficiency .",
    "we have taken a rather low value for the @xmath41-tagging efficiency ( 0.4 ) , in order to substantially lower mistagging rates and thus to significantly reduce the backgrounds coming from non-@xmath41-quark jets .",
    "our signal events should not have much missing energy .",
    "we can , therefore , significantly reduce the @xmath14 backgrounds by demanding that the mssing energy in these events satisfies @xmath94 we envision the search for this asymmetry occurring after the higgs has already been discovered and its mass is known .",
    "we have , therefore , cut the invariant mass of the jets to be near the higgs mass .",
    "further , the @xmath41 jets from the higgs decay tend to be energetic , typically around the jacobean peak near @xmath95 .",
    "for this reason , we apply a higher transverse momentum cut on the jets .",
    "our final cuts for this process are @xmath96 further suppressing the background . with these cuts ,",
    "the signal over background can be seen in figure [ sob ] .",
    "we see that the background rate is much greater than the signal for small @xmath42 .",
    "the angular distributions of the background processes ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bckgrnd ] ) )    are shown in fig .",
    "[ backgrounds ] .",
    "many different final state partons have been separately presented for clarity .",
    "the leading background comes from qcd @xmath97 , where at least one jet is @xmath41-tagged .",
    "the sub - leading background is from @xmath98 ( labelled as @xmath99 ) , and the next one is due to @xmath100 .",
    "the full set of cuts given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cuts ] ) , ( [ eq : missingcuts ] ) and ( [ eq : finalcuts ] ) are applied along with @xmath41-tagging of at - least one jet .",
    "each background is added to the previous one so that the top curve gives the total background .",
    "the shapes of the background distributions are qualitatively different from that of the signal , while the total rate is much larger than the signal for small @xmath42 ( see figure [ sob ] . )",
    "example distributions are shown in the left panel and the right panel of fig .",
    "[ signal ]       for @xmath65 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "the solid curve in each plot is the sm expectation , and the dashed curve corresponds to the sum of the signal and backgrounds .",
    "it is reassuring to see that the asymmety changes sign with a change of the sign of @xmath78 , which indicates a dominance of the linear contribution of @xmath42 to the asymmetry and thus justifies the leading effective operator approximation .",
    "as found earlier , the signal asymmetry occurs not far from @xmath102 , while the background tends to be larger near @xmath103 .",
    "this thus motivates us to evaluate the asymmetry @xmath76 in a restricted region @xmath104 the resulting asymmetry is shown in fig .",
    "[ asymmetry ] ,    where all backgrounds have been taken into account .",
    "we see that the measured asymmetry could reach percentage level .",
    "a straightforward gaussian estimate of the significance is given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the total cross section and @xmath107 is the integrated luminosity .",
    "inverting this gives the integrated luminosity required to discover this asymmetry at an @xmath108 significance @xmath109 the integrated luminosity to measure this asymmetry at 1@xmath3 ( dotted line ) , 3@xmath3 ( dashed line ) and 5@xmath3 ( solid line ) level is given in figure [ fig : gauss ] .",
    "for instance , for @xmath65 , one would need an integrated luminosity of about 60 , 520 or 1440 fb@xmath110 to reach 1 , 3 or 5@xmath3 sensitivity , respectively .",
    "the sensitivity can be significantly improved if we consider a @xmath111 distribution of the binned data .",
    "the `` log likelihood '' ( ll ) is defined to be @xmath112 , \\ ] ] where @xmath113 is the number of events observed in bin @xmath114 where @xmath115 are expected .",
    "the ll determines the likelihood that the expected number of events in each bin could fluctuate up to mimic what is observed .",
    "the larger the ll , the less likely it is a fluctuation .",
    "we plot the ll as a function of @xmath42 normalized to units of fb in fig .",
    "[ llvsbt](a ) where we have taken the expectation ( @xmath115 ) to be that of the sm ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) .",
    "once a signal observation is indicated , it would be important to address whether one is able to determine the sign of @xmath42 , which not only checks the consistency of the leading operator approximation , but would also give a hint for the underlying physics responsible for the cp violating interactions .",
    "we plot the ll as a function of @xmath42 normalized to units of fb in fig .",
    "[ llvsbt](b ) but take the observation ( @xmath113 ) to be that for @xmath43 , @xmath116 and @xmath65 while the expectation ( @xmath115 ) is given by the value of @xmath42 along the horizontal axis .",
    "it is interesting to see that the results for @xmath117 are indeed more similar and it may take more data to distinguish the sign ambiguity for a large value of @xmath42 .       in the limit of large @xmath113 , the ll approaches a @xmath111 distribution . to determine the value of the ll",
    "corresponding with the gaussian 1 , 3 and 5@xmath3 deviations , we equate the probabilities of fluctuating up to that point or higher as in @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the number of bins in our ll construction and @xmath120 is the ll necessary to give a significance of @xmath121 .",
    "if the data is treated with only one bin ( @xmath122 ) , then the ll approaches the significance squared @xmath123 .",
    "we review the derivation of the ll from a poisson probability in appendix [ app : ll ] .    in our analysis",
    ", we used 14 bins so that a 1 , 3 and 5@xmath3 deviation corresponds with a ll of @xmath124 based on these results and matching the ll ( fb ) in fig .",
    "[ llvsbt](a ) , we can invert to obtain the integrated luminosity required to achieve a 1 , 3 and 5@xmath3 deviation of this observable .",
    "we present the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : lll ] , for the integrated luminosity required to measure the absolute value of @xmath45 on the left panel at 1@xmath3 ( dotted line ) , 3@xmath3 ( dashed line ) and 5@xmath3 ( solid line ) level .",
    "we find that for @xmath65 , we can measure the absolute value of the asymmetry at 3@xmath3 ( 5@xmath3 ) with approximately 30 fb@xmath110 ( 50 fb@xmath110 ) . to determine the sign of the asymmetry , we must determine the probability that the asymmetry with one sign could fluctuate to look like the asymmetry with the opposite sign .",
    "following a similar procedure , but using the distribution with @xmath42 taking the opposite sign for the expectation in each bin ( the @xmath115 ) , we present the integrated luminosity to establish the sign of the asymmetry at 1 , 3 and 5@xmath3 level in the right panel of figure [ fig : lll ] . we find that it takes approximately 380 fb@xmath110 ( 650 fb@xmath110 ) to determine its sign at 3@xmath3 ( 5@xmath3 ) for @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath0 interaction in the context of possible cp violation has been extensively studied for @xmath125 colliders @xcite . due to the neutrality of the initial state and",
    "well - constrained kinematics , it is found that an @xmath125 linear collider could have significant sensitivity to probe the cp - odd coupling of @xmath0 , especially if beam polarization is achievable .",
    "our work first established the feasibility to test the cp violation effects via similar genuine cp - odd variables particularly suitable for the lhc for a light higgs boson well below the @xmath126 threshold .    assuming the observation of a light higgs boson at the lhc",
    ", we have demonstrated the extent to which a cp - violating interaction in the @xmath0 vertex could be explored .",
    "it has been shown recently that this channel may become one of the higgs discovery channels due to the improved techniques of studying jet substructure @xcite and superstructure @xcite , and it is thus conceivable that some further enhancement for the signal - to - background ratio may be achieved with more sophisticated kinematical considerations .",
    "the lhc reach for discovering the cp - violation in higgs couplings reported in this paper should be taken as a conservative estimate .",
    "furthermore , our proposal is applicable to any higgs mass , as long as the production rate is sizable and higgs decay is identifiable .    besides the cp studies for a heavy higgs boson @xcite , the coupling @xmath127 for a light higgs was also explored via the weak boson fusion ( wbf ) production channel @xcite .",
    "it was found that cp - even and cp - odd operators may lead to qualitatively different angular distributions .",
    "however , due to the lack of particle charge identification , no cp - odd observables can be constructed for the wbf processes .    in this article , we have only studied the effect of @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : operator ] ) beyond the tree - level sm . in principle",
    ", there could also be contributions to @xmath40 and @xmath41 which would contribute symmetrically to the signal .",

    "[ fig : gauss ] would still hold .",
    "the need for new cp - violating interactions to explain the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry is pressing , and the unexplored higgs sector may hold the key . if the lhc discovers the higgs boson(s ) , a detailed study of the properties of the higgs will then begin .",
