    "billing , is a smart data pricing ( sdp ) method that is used in practice , e.g. , by internet service providers , to charge for transferring data @xcite .",
    "recently , burstable billing is also widely adopted by colocation data center ( cdc ) providers , e.g. , creative data concepts @xcite , netsource communications @xcite and co-location.com @xcite , as a means to charge their users for bandwidth usage . according to colocation america ,",
    "bandwidth billing has become the second largest aspect of cdc users overall costs , second to energy billing @xcite .    under burstable billing , the _ provider _ , who provides its _ users _ with links for data transferring , will measure each of its user s usage of bandwidth based on the user s _ peak usage _ at a certain percentile , often at the _ 95th percentile usage_. by construction , burstable billing neglects the user s usage of bandwidth during any time other than period of peak use .",
    "hence , burstable billing allows users to exceed their usage thresholds for a short period without facing financial penalty @xcite .    in general ,",
    "burstable billing can be studied from two different viewpoints : _ provider s _ and _",
    "users_. for studies that address burstable billing from the provider s viewpoint @xcite , a common strategy is for the provider to move different users workloads across space and time to avoid coinciding their peak usages , thus , reducing the overall peak demand for bandwidth @xcite .",
    "however , whether or not users are willing to modulate their workloads is often overlooked .",
    "[ fig : example ]    the studies that address burstable billing from the user s perspective have emerged only recently .",
    "so far , due to the lack of a tractable mathematical expression to calculate the _",
    "95th percentile usage _ of bandwidth , a common approach has been to use experimental and/or heuristic methods , e.g. , as in @xcite .",
    "there are also few studies that are analytical ; however , they assume that the workload has a specified distribution , e.g. , gaussian distribution @xcite , or they focus on peak pricing , i.e. , the @xmath2 percentile billing instead of @xmath3 percentile billing @xcite , or they assume that the cost of bandwidth is volume - based @xcite .    in this paper , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] , we are interested in studying burstable billing from the _ user s viewpoint _ by taking into consideration the trade - off between cost and performance based on user s preferences . specifically , we seek to answer this fundamental question : _ what is the best way for an individual user , such as a data center in a cdc , who is charged via burstable billing , to manage its operation and the use of bandwidth _ ?",
    "our approach to answer this question is based on formulating and solving an optimization problem for bandwidth usage which aims at maximizing the user s _ surplus _ , i.e. , its net utility minus cost .",
    "we take into consideration the fact that , in practice , neither the user nor the provider have perfect knowledge about the workload , and thus the demand for bandwidth in the future . for example , when it comes to a user in a cdc as in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] , the workload is initiated by the user s clients , not the user itself .",
    "therefore , in our analysis , we address demand uncertainty within a stochastic optimization framework .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows :    1 .   to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first paper to study the problem of optimal responding to burstable billing from a single user s viewpoint under demand uncertainty with arbitrary probability distributions .",
    "2 .   to facilitate the use of systematic optimization",
    ", we develop a tractable mathematical expression to calculate the _ 95th percentile usage _ of bandwidth .",
    "this model is then used to formulate a novel bandwidth allocation problem to maximize the user s surplus .",
    "additionally , we examine different solution methods to find the exact and near - optimal solutions of the formulated problem .",
    "we extend our design as well to another emerging practical scenario where a user can receive service from multiple providers , e.g. , when a user can request content it needs from multiple providers that all employ burstable billing .",
    "accordingly , our problem formulation also addresses workload distribution in addition to bandwidth allocation .",
    "we evaluate our design based on a real - world workload trace : wikipedia page view data @xcite . with a typical workload forecasting method",
    ", we show that the use of our design is particularly rewarding if a user is charged by high bandwidth price and/or it is more sensitive to price than to performance .",
    "finally , we also show the advantage of utilizing services from multiple providers , where we can further increase the user s surplus by distributing its workload to multiple providers that employ burstable billing .    ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath4 samples , the _ 95th percentile usage _ is obtained as 399.1277 mbps , which is equal to the highest recorded bandwidth usage of the remaining @xmath5 samples .",
    "95th percentile usage _ is shown by the red line . here",
    ", the user is allowed to have a total of 432 bursts above the red line without facing financial penalty . ]",
    "in this section , we formulate a mathematical expression for a user s _ 95th percentile usage _ , which is a key concept in burstable billing .",
    "this model is then used to obtain the user s expected bandwidth cost and surplus prior to a billing cycle .      in order to apply burstable billing ,",
    "a provider first divides a billing cycle into @xmath6 time intervals of equal length @xmath7 .",
    "the length of time intervals could be as low as 30 seconds , though typically the time intervals of @xmath8 minuets are considered @xcite .",
    "next , to obtain a user s _ 95th percentile usage _ , the provider takes samples of the user s usage of bandwidth , e.g. , once every five minutes during that billing cycle .",
    "then , the top @xmath9 of the samples gathered within the billing cycle are thrown away and the highest element of the remaining @xmath10 samples is taken as the user s _ 95th percentile usage_. an example for calculating the _ 95th percentile usage _ is shown in fig .",
