    "modelling frictional interactions is a challenging task , both for the variety of behaviours experimentally observed , and for the relevance of such phenomena in the study and control of mechanical devices .",
    "the common strategy consists of a multiscale approach , where the frictional behaviour is an emergent macroscopic property of mechanical interactions between the asperities of the two surfaces occurring at microscale @xcite .",
    "such interactions are often described by modelling the asperities with simple mechanical systems , such as springs and bristles @xcite .",
    "a classical example of such multiscale approach is the prandtl - tomlinson model , developed to explain the genesis of coulomb dry friction @xcite .",
    "the model considers the motion of a point mass along a sinusoidal potential , subject to an external driving force and a viscous damping , showing convergence to a dry friction behaviour when the sinusoidal oscillations decrease homothetically .",
    "this scenario can be related to the interaction of a single asperity of the upper surface with a rigid rough lower surface .",
    "such representation applies also to the interaction of the cantilever with the surface in a friction force microscope .    in this paper",
    "we follow this multiscale paradigm to propose an explanation of the genesis of a directional asymmetry in the coefficients of coulomb dry friction , in situations where the interaction between the two surfaces is mediated by bristle - like elements .",
    "our work is motivated by a growing interest in the modelling and development of crawling locomotors , exploiting an asymmetry in the friction coefficients @xcite .",
    "such directionality of frictional forces is common both in nature @xcite and in bio - inspired robots @xcite , and is usually obtained thanks to elastic elements , such as oblique filaments or bristles ( e.g.  the _ setae _ in earthworms ) , that mediate the interaction between the crawler and the surface @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the paper @xcite by mielke . here",
    ", it is shown that the quasi - static behaviour of a family of prandtl  tomlinson - like systems , in which the fluctuation in the potential decreases homothetically , converge to that of a particle subject to dry friction . moreover ,",
    "the leftwards and rightwards friction coefficients coincide with the minimum and maximum of the derivative of the oscillating potential . in this way , a directionality in the friction",
    "is produced simply by assuming a suitable asymmetry in the potential . as we discuss in section [ sec : strat ] , a key element in this approach is the change in the nature of the dissipation , from viscous in the approximating systems to rate - independent in the limit one .",
    "we apply these ideas to study the limit behaviour of systems characterized by a mediating , bristle - like element , interacting with a wiggly surface whose periodic fluctuations scale homothetically to zero . in this way the wiggly potential is generated by the small oscillations in the mediating element , induced by the fluctuations of the surface .",
    "moreover an asymmetry in the wiggly potential can be simply produced by an asymmetry in the mediating element ( e.g.  the inclination of a bristle ) , also in the case of a symmetric surface .    in order to apply mielke",
    "s approach to our problem , we need to extend his framework to more general families of approximating systems , in which the scaling of the wiggly potential is no longer homothetic , but contains also a nonlinear term ( cf .",
    "this is our first result , presented in section [ sec : abstr ] ( theorem [ th : main ] ) , and constitutes the abstract contribution of this paper .    from the point of view of applications ,",
    "our main result is to provide some physical insight into the origin of directional friction .",
    "this is obtained by constructing some concrete examples of simple mechanical systems producing , in the limit , directional dry friction , and by interpreting the origin of this frictional asymmetry in terms of the parameters characterizing each example .",
    "the friction coefficients we obtain are the product of two factors .",
    "the first one is `` geometric '' : it contains the asymmetry of the system and is determined only by the roughness of the surface and by the angle of the mediating bristle - like element .",
    "the second factor is instead `` energetic '' : it depends on the limit energetic state of the mediating element , but not on the direction of motion .",
    "this last coefficient is proportional to the normal force exerted , at the limit , by the mediating element on the surface . in this way",
    "we recover the classical structure of coulomb friction law , where the friction force is the product of a coefficient characteristic of the surfaces and the modulus of the normal forces exchanged between them .",
    "our results are then used to discuss the _ with the nap / against the nap _ asymmetry . as we will argue better in section [ sec : contropelo ] , our intuition of such asymmetry actually includes under the same name several distinct phenomena , producing the same kind of directionality . despite the complex behaviour that can be showed by a bristle , our model of section [ sec:3 m ] can be used to outline two fundamental effects , corresponding to changes in the two factors that characterize the friction coefficients . the _ geometric effect _ occurs when the bristle keeps the same configuration during the two phases ( with and against the nap ) , and the directionality is due to the inclination of the bristle , that in this way `` perceives '' a symmetric fluctuation of the surface as asymmetric .",
    "the _ energetic effect _ applies to situations where the configuration of the bristle flips when the velocity changes sign , so that the tip of the bristle is always behind its root with respect to the direction of motion . in this case",
    "the geometric component is unchanged , but the bristle switches between two different energetic states , exerting a different normal force on the surface .",
    "finally , we notice that the behaviour of the model of section [ sec:3 m ] has a close resemblance to that observed experimentally for the robotic crawler developed in @xcite . there , slanted bristles , interacting with a groove - textured surface , are used to obtain net displacement , when the body of the crawler performs a cycle of elongation and contraction .",
    "the bristle - surface interaction produces an oscillatory friction force , and it is shown that the system can be effectively discussed considering supports moving on a flat surface and experiencing a constant average friction force .",
    "such result supports our approach and encourages a future experimental validation of the predictions of our models .",
    "in this section we show that the evolution of a prototype one dimensional rate independent system , with energy @xmath0 and a dissipation potential @xmath1 positively homogeneous of degree @xmath2 , can be constructed as the limit of the evolutions of a family of systems @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , with @xmath5 an oscillatory ( `` wiggly '' ) small perturbation , and @xmath6 is a small viscous dissipation potential .",
    "the system @xmath3 will describe a motion on an undulatory surface with vanishing small roughness , while the system @xmath7 describes motion on a flat surface with directional dry friction .",
    "let us therefore consider a mechanical system having internal energy @xmath8 where @xmath9 $ ] represent the time and @xmath10 is a one - dimensional state variable .",

    "the energy of these systems is obtained by adding to @xmath0 a small wiggly perturbation .",
    "more precisely we have @xmath25 with @xmath26 here @xmath27 is a @xmath2-periodic ( non - constant ) function ; whereas @xmath28 , for some @xmath29 , is @xmath2-periodic and @xmath30 in the second variable .",

    "formula shows that the effective friction @xmath88 in the @xmath39 limit is the product of two quantities : @xmath89 associated to @xmath77 and @xmath90 associated to @xmath69 .",
    "on one hand the `` geometric '' coefficients @xmath91 are related to the ( directional ) roughness of the surface , as perceived by the geometry of the system .",
    "on the other hand , the `` energetic '' coefficient @xmath90 is associated to a tension  in the element that mediates the frictional interaction .",
    "this duality is quite central in our applications .",
    "firstly , this distinction reinforces the resemblance with coulomb s classical formulation of dry friction , where the friction intensity depends both on a coefficient , related to the properties of the interacting surfaces , and on the normal force exerted by each surface on the other one .",
    "remarkably , in our models , the term @xmath90 is proportional to the normal force exerted , in the limit case , on the surface by the mediating element .",
    "moreover , when discussing the _ with the nap/ against the nap _ asymmetry in section [ sec : contropelo ] , we will see that it can be produced by two distinct effects : a geometric effect , given by the intrinsic asymmetry of the system , as captured by the coefficients @xmath89 , and a energetic effect , where we observe a change of the configuration of the system between the two phases ( with and against the nap ) , producing a change in the value of @xmath90 .",
    "in this section we discuss three different models to obtain directional dry friction as the limit of the effects of an interaction with a surface having vanishingly small roughness , with the mediation of a hair / bristle - like element .",

    "although we intuitively gather all this instances under the same name of _ with the nap / against the nap _ asymmetry , what we are actually considering is family of different phenomena , all producing the same kind of directional effect .",
    "for instance , in some situations there is no significant change in the bristle configuration between the two phases ( e.g. ,  rubbing gently a hard brush ) , while in others large deformations of the bristles occur and we observe a dramatic change in their configuration passing from one direction to the other one ( e.g. ,  stroking a cat ) .",
    "clearly a comprehensive and complete characterization of all these with the nap / against the nap phenomena would require a sophisticated modelling of the mechanical behaviour of a bristle .",
    "yet , with the help of the model of section [ sec:3 m ] , we can easily identify two fundamental effects that are involved .",
    "the geometric one is a direct application of the angular spring model , and holds for sufficiently rigid bristles , remaining straight also under small compressions .",

    "[ [ geometric - effect ] ] geometric effect + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    from , we obtain that , for the angular spring model , we have @xmath168 , meaning that the friction opposing a rightward movement ( @xmath169 ) is smaller than the one corresponding to a leftward movement ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "this is exactly what we expect by the with the nap / against the nap effect .",
    "however , it is not obvious that a bristle should always behave as a rigid bar with an angular spring .",
    "indeed , especially during strokes against the nap , the rod is subject to a longitudinal compression , that could produce buckling in a flexible bar , invalidating the model .",
    "an estimate of the axial tension along the bar , obtained by considering the limit case when the lower end of the bar moves on a flat surface experiencing dry friction , is @xmath237 where @xmath88 depends on the direction of motion .",
    "we observe that during a stroke against the nap ( so @xmath238 ) the bar is always compressed ( @xmath239 ) , however this tension is small when the bristle oscillates near its rest position ( @xmath240 ) and the friction coefficients are small .",
    "this situation suits well to the motion of a hard brush rubbed gently on a smooth surface .",
    "[ [ energetic - effect ] ] energetic effect + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    when the critical load for buckling is too low , the above description is no longer valid , but we can still apply the model of section [ sec:3 m ] when the bristle is subject to traction . the following interpretation of the with the nap / against the nap effect is based on such assumption .    when moved with the nap , the hair is rotated in the same direction of its rest angle , as shown in figure [ fig : contropelo](a ) , so that the angular spring is only slightly stretched . on the other hand ,",
    "when the hair is moved against the nap , it is rotated in the opposite direction of its rest position , as shown in figure [ fig : contropelo](b ) ; in this way the angular spring is much more stretched than in the previous case . another way to describe",
    "this scenario is to notice that the tip of the hair is always behind its root , with respect to the direction of motion .",
    "hence , if we report both situations to the framework of our model of section [ sec:3 m ] ( as done in figure [ fig : contropelo ] ) , we observe that the two cases share the same coefficient @xmath145 , while we have a change in the coefficient @xmath90 , since the rest angle of the hair changes . in case of _ with the nap _",
    "motion , the rest angle of the hair is @xmath241 . on the other hand , the case of _ against the nap _",
    "motion corresponds to @xmath242 .    in this way we can immediately recover the friction coefficients using and .",
    "we get @xmath243 where we trivially have @xmath244 , in agreement with our common experience of the phenomenon .",
    "we now analyse the compatibility of this interpretation with the tension of the bristle during the motion .",
    "we notice that , since in both phases we have @xmath245 , the last term in gives always a positive contribution to the tension .",
    "thus , if the surface is quite rough ( @xmath246 large ) and the bristle flexible ( @xmath247 small ) , the rod is subject to traction , so that our model provides a good approximation .",
    "we remark that this energetic interpretation requires a transitional phase , where the bristle is strongly deformed , to account for the change of configuration occurring when the direction of motion is inverted .",
    "since we assume a small critical load and high friction , we expect this transition to be triggered by buckling when the direction is changed , and that , afterwards , a sufficiently long motion in same same direction restores the bristle to a stable straight state , as those we discussed above .",
    "the main issue in section [ sec : abstr ] is the change in the nature of the dissipation : in the approximating systems @xmath3 we have a viscous drag ( i.e.  the dissipation potential @xmath248 is quadratic ) , whereas in the limit system it is rate independent ( i.e.  the dissipation potential @xmath248 is positively homogeneous of degree @xmath2 ) .",
