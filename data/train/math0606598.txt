    "the fukaya category which was introduced in  @xcite has seen increasing interest in recent years .",
    "much of the interest was sparked by kontsevich s homological mirror symmetry conjecture  @xcite which relates the fukaya category of a symplectic manifold to the category of coherent sheaves of a conjectural mirror .",
    "however , there have been recent results that underscore the relevance of this category to problems in pure symplectic topology ( see  @xcite , and  @xcite for example ) .    despite this interest",
    ", there are very few compact symplectic manifolds whose fukaya category is well understood .",
    "even linear invariants which can be extracted from it ( of these , hochschild ( co)-homology has attracted the most interest ) are only known in very few situations , and then , only as a result of a proof of homological mirror symmetry ( although picard - lefschetz theory yields an approach which should be sufficient to understand , say , the hochschild cohomology of the fukaya category of calabi - yau complete intersections in projective space ) .",
    "this means that the only compact symplectic manifolds for which computations have been performed are the elliptic curve  @xcite ,  @xcite , quartic surfaces  @xcite , and abelian varieties  @xcite ,  @xcite . also as a consequence of homological mirror symmetry",
    ", we also have a good understanding of the fukaya - seidel category ( which can be thought of as the fukaya category of a symplectic manifold relative a symplectic hypersurface ) for some ( mostly two dimensional ) lefschetz fibration  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider another family of examples : riemann surfaces . beyond the fact that there is a well developed theory for the study of curves on surfaces (",
    "of which we use only a small part ) , there are two motivations for studying these examples . from the point of view of homological mirror symmetry ,",
    "an understanding of the fukaya category of higher genus riemann surfaces would give at least some indication as to what form the conjecture should take in the case of complex manifolds of general type .",
    "this is a project whose main proponent for the moment is katzarkov .",
    "we also believe that studying this family of examples is interesting without reference to mirror symmetry , as we can hope to use them as `` building blocks '' to understand the fukaya categories of higher dimensional symplectic manifolds .",
    "the main result of the paper is the following    [ main ] if the euler characteristic of @xmath0 is negative , then the grothendieck group of the derived fukaya category of @xmath0 is isomorphic to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the unit tangent bundle .",
    "we will denote this grothendieck group by @xmath3 although we should strictly speaking write @xmath4 to emphasize the fact that we are not computing any higher @xmath5-groups .",
    "the map to @xmath6 is the map which takes every smooth embedded curve @xmath7 to the homology class of its lift to @xmath2 , whereas that to @xmath8 is given by computing the holonomy of a connection @xmath9-form , and hence is not canonical . in reality",
    ", we will prove the theorem by choosing a ( non - canonical ) splitting @xmath10    the fukaya category we shall consider will have as objects essential closed embedded curves equipped with the bounding spin structure .",
    "we hope to return in a future paper to the subject of the fukaya category in which @xmath11 local systems are allowed .",
    "we end this introduction with an outline of the paper . in section [ floer - hlgy ] , we define floer homology for a certain class of immersed curves on @xmath0 , and use this in the next section to define the fukaya category of @xmath0 .",
    "the next two sections prove generalizations of well known results about hamiltonian invariance and a geometric interpretation of some extensions in term of resolving singularities .",
    "the main technical part of the paper is section [ triv - obj ] , where we prove the existence of the map from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "in section [ relations ] and [ computing ] we complete the proof of theorem [ main ] by reducing it to some well - known facts about the mapping class groups of surfaces .",
    "the remainder of the paper consists of four appendices , in which we collect , for the convenience of the reader , some useful facts about winding numbers , the symplectomorphism groups of surfaces , the @xmath14 pre - category formalism of kontsevich and soibelman , and the construction of the derived category of an @xmath14 pre - category using twisted complexes .",
    "i benefited from conversations about some aspect of this project or the other with ( in alphabetical order ) kevin costello , matthew day , benson farb , ludmil katzarkov , andy putman , paul seidel , nathalie wahl , shmuel weinberger , and robert young .",
    "i would also like to thank the department of mathematics of the chinese university of hong kong and the institute of mathematical sciences , and especially conan naichung leung , for providing me with a supportive work environment during my stay in hong kong where part of this paper was written .",
    "i would finally like to thank the referee for an exceptional job .",
    "floer homology is a homology theory which assigns a group to appropriate pairs of lagrangian submanifolds of a symplectic manifold .",
    "the fact that these homology groups in dimension @xmath15 are combinatorial in nature is well known among symplectic topologists and has been used sporadically in the literature , for example in many of the aforementioned results on homological mirror symmetry for elliptic curves , or for lefschetz fibrations in dimension two .",
    "however , the non - expert still has to parse through the literature on @xmath16-holomorphic curves , with their compactness and regularity properties , in order to even get a definition of floer homology , not to mention the proofs of basic results .",
    "it is in order to make the paper accessible to non - experts that we therefore begin with a construction of floer homology ab initio .",
    "we explain enough of the theory that the relevant ideas and techniques may become clear .",
    "we hope that those unfamiliar with floer theory will forgive this partial state of affairs , while the expert will excuse the inclusion of detailed proofs of many results which she will think are well - known and established . maybe she will accept the excuse that floer theory usually restricts itself to embedded lagrangians , whereas we will need to use some immersed curves in our arguments .",
    "it is possible to replace the use of immersed curves by more algebraic arguments , but that would make the details more cumbersome .",
    "let @xmath0 be a surface , possibly with boundary , equipped with a symplectic form @xmath17 .",
    "an * unobstructed * curve @xmath18 is a properly immersed oriented smooth curve which is the image of a properly embedded line in the universal cover of @xmath0 .",
    "as we will see later , our curves will always be equipped with one marked point .",
    "strictly speaking , we only care about closed curves . however , as we will be passing to infinite covers in some of our arguments , we will also need to consider the non - closed case . for convenience",
    ", we will adopt notation from homological algebra , and write @xmath19 $ ] for the curve obtained by changing the orientation of @xmath7 .",

    "@xmath7 is not null - homotopic , and 2 .",
    "@xmath7 does not bound an immersed `` fish - tail '' ( see figure [ fish ] ) .    formally , a `` fish - tail '' is a map from the disc @xmath21 to the surface @xmath0 which takes the boundary of @xmath21 to @xmath7 and which is non - singular at every point except one point on the boundary .",
    "note that @xmath7 is null - homotopic if and only if it is the image of an immersed circle in the universal cover , and hence can not be unobstructed .",
    "if @xmath7 is not null homotopic , then it lifts to a properly immersed curve @xmath22 in the universal cover .",
    "the curve @xmath22 is embedded if and only if it does not bound a fishtail , which would project to give an immersed fishtail in @xmath0 . for the converse , choosing the basepoint to be the singular point of the fishtail , it is easy to see that an immersed fishtail in @xmath0 with boundary on @xmath7 lifts to such a fishtail in the universal cover with boundary on @xmath22",
    ".    let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be unobstructed curves which intersect transversally .",

    "we are therefore abusing notation by assigning a degree to @xmath25 . in practice , however , this should cause no confusion as the intended meaning will be clear from the context .",
    "@xmath31    ideally , we would define the floer complex to be a complex over @xmath8 generated by the intersection points",
    ". we would be able to define the differential since it involves only a finite sum of contributions given by certain bigons .",
    "however , the higher products which we will discuss in section [ infty_structure ] may involve contributions of countably many polygons , and it is not clear that the corresponding series converge . it is in order to address these convergence problems that the use of novikov rings was introduced in symplectic topology .",
    "the * universal novikov ring * @xmath32 is the ring of formal power series of the form @xmath33 where the coefficients @xmath34 vanish for all sufficiently negative @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are a sequence of real numbers satisfying @xmath37    the idea is that the coefficients @xmath36 keep track of areas of polygons , and that if there are infinitely many polygons that appear in some computation , there are still only finitely many whose area is below a certain bound . in particular , the coefficients @xmath38 correspond to the finite number of polygons of area @xmath36 .",
    "we now begin implementing these ideas :    the * floer complex * of @xmath39 is the free @xmath40-graded module over the universal novikov ring @xmath32 generated by intersection points of @xmath23 and @xmath24",

    "it is fairly easy to see that if @xmath61 is non - empty , then the degree of @xmath26 and @xmath43 differ by @xmath9 .",

    "note that the symplectic dehn twist is constant away from the width-@xmath538 collar of @xmath7 , hence extends to @xmath0 .",
    "any two symplectic dehn twists about @xmath7 are hamiltonian isotopic    any two collar neighbourhoods of the same area are hamiltonian isotopic , so one can prove the result for the annulus by explicitly producing the desired hamiltonian function .",
    "alternatively , one can use the characterization of the group of hamiltonian symplectomorphisms as the kernel of the flux homomorphism , and check that the flux of a dehn twist followed by the inverse of a dehn twist vanishes .",

    "indeed , if @xmath7 and @xmath528 are non - separating simple closed curves which are isotopic through a cylinder of area @xmath477 , then @xmath544 is an element of @xmath543 which represents the poincar dual of @xmath545 $ ] in @xmath546 .",
