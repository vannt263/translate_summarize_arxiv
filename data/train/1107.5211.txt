    "from the observational data of supernovae of type ia ( sn ia ) @xcite , it was reported that the present observable universe is undergoing an accelerating phase . the mysterious source for this late - time acceleration",
    "was dubbed ` dark energy ' . despite many years of research ( see e.g. , the reviews @xcite ) its origin has not been identified yet .",
    "dark energy possesses negative pressure leading the accelerated expansion of the universe by counteracting the gravitational force .",
    "one possible approach for the construction of dark energy models is the modification of the geometrical part of the einstein equations .",
    "this approach known as modified gravity can successfully explain the rotation curves of galaxies , the motion of galaxy clusters , the bullet cluster , and cosmological observations without the use of dark matter or einstein s cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 theory of gravity is a candidate of modified theories of gravity which is obtained by replacing the ricci scalar @xmath1 with an arbitrary function @xmath0 in the einstein - hilbert lagrangian ( see @xcite for reviews on this topic ) .",
    "recently different forms of @xmath0 have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these theories can produce inflation , mimic behavior of dark matter and current cosmic acceleration if suitable positive and negative powers of curvature are added into the einstein - hilbert action @xcite . besides , compatibility with observational data , the modified gravity theory has to be compatible with general relativity and other viability conditions @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section ii , we discuss briefly the basics of the @xmath0 model and construct the modified field equations . then in section iii , we discuss the noether gauge symmetry approach for the @xmath0 modified gravity . in section iv",
    ", we check the stability conditions on the @xmath0 functions and finally conclude our paper in the last section . throughout this paper , we choose units @xmath2 and the metric signature @xmath3 .",
    "in this section a spatially flat friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe within the framework of @xmath0 gravity is considered .",
    "our aim is to investigate models which exhibit noether symmetry with gauge term ; we do not take in account matter contribution in the action .",
    "we start with a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional action @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath1 is the scalar curvature and @xmath0 is an arbitrary non - linear function of @xmath1 .",
    "the first model proposed had the form @xmath5 , in which the correction in @xmath6 becomes important only at low curvatures @xmath7 .",
    "it is demonstrated in @xcite that action ( 1 ) is never renormalizable . in order it to be renormalizable , as it is shown there , @xmath8 should consists of @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to the desired phenomenological properties of modified gravity in cosmology , there is some motivation for these models from m - theory @xcite .",
    "variation of the action ( 1 ) with respect to the metric yields the field equations @xmath10 where a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath1 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the operator @xmath13 represents covariant derivative and @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the geometry of the spacetime is given by the flat frw line element @xmath15 with the consideration of this model the field equations become @xmath16,\\\\ h^2&=&\\frac{1}{6f'}[f'r - f-6\\dot rhf''],\\label{5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the hubble parameter and overdot denotes the derivative with respect to proper time @xmath18 . to investigate ngs an effective lagrangian for the model",
    "is needed whose variation with respect to its dynamical variables yields the correct form of the equations of motion .",
    "we follow the work of souza and faraoni @xcite and consider the above action that represents a dynamical system in which the scale factor @xmath19 and the scalar curvature @xmath1 play the role of dynamical variables .",
    "the action ( 1 ) can be written as @xcite @xmath20,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the definition of @xmath1 is introduced in terms of @xmath19 and its derivatives as a constraint . in order to apply the ngs approach ,",
    "one may easily verify that , in the frw model , the lagrangian related to the above action ( 6 ) takes the form @xmath21 varying the lagrangian ( 7 ) with respect to @xmath1 yields the following relation for the scalar curvature @xmath22 the equation ( 4 ) can be obtained by varying the lagrangian ( 7 ) with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "noether symmetries are the symmetries of the lagrangians which have found a recent impetus since these can reveal new features of the gravitational theories @xcite .",
    "the ns are essential tools for solving the gravitational field equations @xcite . in scalar - tensor cosmology",
    ", this approach results in an extra correction term @xmath6 and fixes the form of the coupling parameter and the field potential @xcite .",
    "this approach yields an exact form of @xmath0 functions relevant for cosmological model @xcite . in the literature ,",
    "noether symmetries have been studied in the context of @xmath0 theory of gravity by ignoring the gauge function in the noether symmetry condition @xcite .",
    "we consider the gauge term of the noether symmetries @xcite . here",
    "we apply the approach of ngs to look at some interesting forms of @xmath0 .    a vector field @xmath23 whose first prolongation is @xmath24}}=\\mathbf{x}+\\dot \\eta(t , a , r)\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\dot a}+\\dot \\beta(t , a , r)\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\dot r},\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is called a ngs if the following condition holds @xmath26}}\\mathcal{l}+(\\mathbf{d}\\xi)\\mathcal{l}=\\mathbf{d}a(t , a , r).\\ ] ] here @xmath27 is the gauge function and @xmath28    using the lagrangian ( 7 ) in ( 12 ) and after the separation of monomials we obtain the following system of determining equations @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32",
    "@xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 where  , \" denotes partial derivative .    from ( [ 16 ] ) , for @xmath36 , we get @xmath37 , then from ( [ 18 ] ) , @xmath38",
    ". therefore the two functions @xmath39 and @xmath27 become only functions of the variable @xmath18 and ( [ 19 ] ) reduces to @xmath40 differentiating this last equation with respect to @xmath1 we get @xmath41 which leads to a contradiction .",
    "hence we take @xmath42 , so from ( [ 16 ] ) @xmath43    there are three cases in the solution of the above determining equations ( 14)-(20 ) .",
    "these are given below .",
    "* case - i*. if @xmath44 is arbitrary , the solution of the above system ( 14)-(20 ) gives rise to the following ngs generator @xmath45 and the gauge term is a constant which can be taken as zero . the energy type first integral is @xmath46    * case - ii*. if @xmath44 is the fractional power law , viz .",
    "@xmath47 then the solution of the determining equations ( 14)-(20 ) yields @xmath48 the gauge term is zero .",
    "the corresponding generators are @xmath49 which constitute a well - known three - dimensional algebra with commutation relations @xmath50=0,\\ , [ \\textbf{x}_0 , \\textbf{x}_2]=0,\\ , [ \\textbf{x}_1 , \\textbf{x}_2]=-\\frac43 \\textbf{x}_2.\\ ] ] here too the gauge term is zero .",
    "the corresponding first integrals are @xmath51    * case - iii*. if @xmath44 is a general power law of the form @xcite @xmath52 then the above linear determining equation system has solution @xmath53 here the gauge term is zero and @xmath54 is a constant in ( 30 ) .",
    "note that if @xmath55 , then @xmath44 is a constant , linear or fractional power law of case - ii .",
    "these are thus excluded in case - iii .",
    "it should also be stated that for case - iii there are two noether symmetries .",
    "the noether symmetry generators are given by @xmath56 the lie algebra is the two - dimensional abelian lie algebra , @xmath57=0 $ ] .",
    "we note that for the fractional power law the algebra is three - dimensional and for the arbitrary power law it is two - dimensional and thus the symmetry breaks by one .",
    "the corresponding first integrals for this case are @xmath58    hence we have obtained some different @xmath0 functions from our analysis . in the next section , we check the conditions under which our @xmath0 functions can produce viable cosmology .",
    "the stability conditions for @xmath0 gravity are @xcite    1 .",
    "@xmath59 for @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the ricci scalar at the present epoch .",
    "this is also required to avoid anti - gravity .",
    "2 .   @xmath62 for @xmath60 .",
    "it ensures consistency with local gravity tests , presence of the matter dominated epoch and the stability of cosmological perturbations .",
    "3 .   @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "this is required for the local gravity tests and for the presence of the matter dominated epoch .",
    "4 .   @xmath65 at @xmath66 .",
    "this is required for the late - time de sitter point .    to ensure classical and quantum stability in the region @xmath1",
    ", we want our @xmath0 theory to satisfy conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "the first condition means that gravity is attractive and the graviton is not a ghost .",
    "it was recognized long ago that its violation during the time evolution of a frw background results in the immediate loss of homogeneity and isotropy and formation of a strong space - like anisotropic curvature singularity @xcite .",
    "the second condition is necessary so that in the case of @xmath0 models of present dark energy , the necessity to keep it valid for all values of @xmath1 during the matter- and radiation - dominated epochs in order to avoid the dolgov - kawasaki instability @xcite .",
    "condition ( 3 ) imposes that the modified @xmath0 gravity must reduce to einstein gravity under a suitable limit of the curvature scalar .",
    "finally condition ( 4 ) tells us of a de sitter point which corresponds to a vacuum solution with constant @xmath1 i.e. @xmath67 at this point .",
    "it trivially implies that any quadratic @xmath68 will satisfy this condition and gives rise an exact de sitter solution .",
    "hence quadratic @xmath0 functions are particularly useful to model inflation .",
    "the stability conditions are satisfied in the following manner respectively :    * conditions ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) give @xmath69 and @xmath70 since @xmath1 is positive .",
    "condition ( 4 ) is not valid in this case .",
    "condition ( 5 ) yields @xmath71 at @xmath72 . *",
    "first two conditions hold @xmath73 , @xmath74 whenever @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "condition ( 3 ) is not valid here since @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "condition ( 4 ) is invalid : it implies @xmath79 at @xmath72 but @xmath76 .",
    "in this paper we have considered the 4-dimensional @xmath0 theory of gravity .",
    "we have taken the spatially flat frw universe in the framework of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "our aim was to investigate models which exhibit noether symmetry with _ gauge _ term , where we have ignored the matter contribution in the action .",
    "on using the lagrangian ( 7 ) in the definition of ngs ( 10 ) we have obtained a system of partial differential equations ( 14 ) - ( 20 ) , which involve four unknown functions @xmath39 , @xmath80 ,",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath27 , where each is a function of three variables @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath1 . the integration of the equations ( 14 ) - ( 20 ) has yielded two different solutions ( [ 2n ] ) and ( [ 5n ] ) . solving the system of equations , we obtained the gauge function to be zero .",
    "we then constructed the symmetry generators and the corresponding conserved quantities ( also known as first integrals or constants of motion ) .",
    "we note that for the fractional power law , the algebra is three - dimensional and for the arbitrary power law , it is two - dimensional and thus the symmetry breaks by one .",
    "a previous study of ours @xcite discussing the @xmath0-tachyon model also resulted a zero gauge function .",
    "thus we conjecture that the application of ngs to generic @xmath0 lagrangian results in zero gauge function .",
    "the symmetry generators give the time translational and scaling symmetry of the theory .",
    "the stability analysis of the two forms of @xmath0 obtained here has been done in section iv .",
    "we have shown that the two forms of @xmath0 given by ( [ 2n ] ) and ( [ 5n ] ) are stable and consistent with the local gravity tests by imposing some restrictions on the constants involved .",
    "recently some black hole solutions have been studied in @xmath0 theory of gravity using some known forms of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it would be of interest to study black hole solutions using the forms of @xmath0 obtained here .",
    "the authors would deeply thank the referee for giving very insightful comments on our work ."
