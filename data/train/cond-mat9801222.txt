    "historically , the isotope effect ( ie ) played a major role in unravelling the questions related to the origin of the effective attractive interaction between charge - carriers which leads to the superconducting state .",
    "the theoretical considerations of frhlich@xcite and the experimental discovery of the ie of @xmath0 in mercury@xcite pointed towards the contribution of lattice dynamics to the instability of the normal state . since then , the ie has often been considered as a measure of the contribution of phonons to the pairing mechanism .",
    "furthermore , it is generally assumed that only those thermodynamical quantities that depend explicitely on the phonon frequencies ( as @xmath0 or the order parameter @xmath10 in the bcs model ) display an ie .",
    "one can show@xcite , however , that such understanding of the isotope effect is incomplete and leads , therefore , to confusion ; this is particularly true for the high - temperature oxides . indeed",
    ", several factors not related to the pairing mechanism can alter the value of the isotope coefficient ( ic ) .",
    "moreover , these factors are not necessarily related to lattice dynamics . here",
    "we focus our attention on three such factors : magnetic impurities , the proximity effect and non - adiabatic charge - transfer as it occurs in high-@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "in addition , we also show @xcite that fundamental quantities such as the penetration depth @xmath1 of a magnetic field also display an ie because of the three factors mentioned above .",
    "note that this effect occurs despite the fact that @xmath1 does not explicitely depend on quantities related to lattice dynamics .",
    "it results from our considerations that the value of the ic ( even its absence ) does not allow any _ a priori _ conclusion about the pairing mechanism .",
    "nevertheless , it remains an interesting effect that enables one to determine the presence of magnetic impurities , proximity effect or non - adiabaticity in the system .",
    "the calculation of the ic and its comparison with experimental results was also used in previous works to determine the value of the coulomb repulsion @xmath11 or the relative weight of different electron - phonon coupling strengths in superconductors ( see below ) .",
    "it can thus be used as a tool for the characterization of superconductors .",
    "this review is mainly based on our papers@xcite .",

    "we also review calculations of the penetration depth isotope effect .",
    "the latter superconducting property is a good example of a quantity that does not directly depend on phonon frequencies and yet can display a substantial isotopic shift @xcite . in this context , we also discuss recent experimental results obtained for la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ( lsco ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : hist ]",
    "we present some of the early results related to the isotope effect and show that even for conventional superconductors the relation between the isotope effect and the pairing mechanism is not simple .",
    "we also discuss the applicability of these early results to the description of high - temperature superconductors .",
    "the remaining sections are devoted to the description of new , unconventional isotope effects . in section [ sec : mi ] we study the influence of magnetic impurities on the value of the isotope effect .",
    "we show that adding magnetic impurities to a superconductor can enhance the isotope coefficient @xmath12 of @xmath0 and induce a temperature - dependent isotope effect of @xmath1 .",

    "we show that due to the proximity effect , the isotope coefficient of @xmath0 is linear in the ratio of the normal to the superconducting film thicknesses @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , the proximity effect induces a temperature and @xmath15-dependent isotope coefficient of the penetration depth .",

    "we show that in systems as the high - temperature superconductors where charge - transfer processes between reservoir and cuo@xmath2-planes occur via ions that display a non - adiabatic behaviour , the charge - carrier density in the planes depend on the ionic mass .",
    "this leads to the unconventional non - adiabatic contribution to the ie of @xmath0 .",
    "it is also interesting that non - adiabaticity induces an isotopic shift of the penetration depth @xmath1 .    in the last section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : htsc ] ) we apply our theory to the oxygen isotope effect ( oie ) in high - temperature superconductors of the ybco - family .",
    "focus is set on the oxygen isotope effect because most experimental studies have been performed on the oxygen ion which is the lightest in the cuo@xmath2 plane .",
    "the situation is less clear in the case of copper isotopic substitution where an effect has also been observed@xcite .",
    "this latter case will be discussed in more detail elswhere .",

    "in analogy to the ic of @xmath0 ( denoted @xmath12 ) we define the isotope coefficient @xmath26 of the penetration depth by the relation @xmath27 one should note that there is a conventional bcs - type isotope effect of the penetration depth related to its temperature dependence @xmath28 . because @xmath0 displays an isotope effect , the penetration depth is also shifted upon isotopic substitution .",
    "the effect becomes strong as one approaches @xmath0 .",
    "the present article is not concerned with this trivial effect .",
    "let us first discuss what values of the isotope coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath26 can be expected for different types of superconductors .",

    "furthermore , high-@xmath0 materials can have values both smaller and larger than @xmath32 , depending on the doping .",

    "[ sssec : band ] ) .",
    "the situation encountered in high - temperature superconductors is very unusual .",

    "the explanation of a small @xmath12 for oxygen substitution coinciding with a high @xmath0 is likely to be related to the contribution of the oxygen modes to the pairing .",

    "let us first describe the situation encountered in transition metals . as has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the two - square model for which ( [ mustar ] ) is derived leads to values of the ic that are only @xmath62 lower than @xmath32 .",
    "however , the deviation is much stronger for some transition metals , leading even to a vanishing coefficient for ruthenium . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite it is necessary to take into account the band structure of transition metals .",
    "the presence of a `` metallic '' @xmath63-band and a narrow @xmath64-band , and the associated peaked structure of the electronic density of states ( dos ) has an impact on the value of @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath43 is much smaller in transition metals than in non - transition metals and leads thus to a smaller effective screening of the coulomb interaction .",
    "these facts have been included in ref .",

    "( [ mustar ] ) .",
    "the values obtained from the modified expression of @xmath12 ( see eq .  ( 9 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) are in good semi - quantitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "one should add that the two - band structure is important even in dirty transition - metal superconductors , although the superconducting state is characterized by only one gap in this case ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further discussions on transition metals ) .",
    "the example of transition metals shows that a quantitative description of the ic requires , among other things , a precise knowledge of the band structure .",
    "this has also been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the large inverse isotope effect observed in uranium . in this context , it would be interesting to determine the uranium isotope effect in heavy - fermion systems ( one should note , however , that there is only one report of the isotope effect in uranium@xcite ) .",
    "another effect of the band structure arises if one assumes that the electronic density of states varies strongly on a scale given by @xmath34 , the bcs energy cutoff ( e.g. , in the presence of a van hove singularity ) . to obtain the bcs expression ( [ tcbcs ] )",
    "we assumed that the electronic density of states ( dos ) is constant in the energy intervall @xmath65 $ ] around the fermi energy .",
    "@xmath45 is then given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the dos at the fermi level and @xmath68 is the attractive part of the electron - electron effective interaction . in a more general case , however , one has to consider the energy dependence of the dos .",
    "though a purely electronic parameter , the energy dependence of the dos appears to influence the isotope effect@xcite",
    ". one can understand this effect qualitatively within a crude extension of the bcs model . instead of taking the dos at the fermi level ,",
    "one replaces @xmath69 by @xmath70 , the average value of the dos @xmath71 over the interval @xmath65 $ ] around @xmath43 .",
    "obviously , this average depends on the cutoff energy @xmath34 of the pairing interaction .",
    "isotopic substitution modifies @xmath34 which affects @xmath70 , and thus @xmath72 and @xmath0 .",
    "a more general analysis of this effect within eliashberg s theory was given in ref .",
    "they find that whereas the ic can reach values above @xmath32 , its minimal value obtained for reasonable choices of the parameters never reaches the small values ( @xmath73 ) found in optimally doped high-@xmath0 compounds .",
    "however , more recent studies of the influence of van hove singularities on the isotope coefficient show that such small values can be obtained , because in this scenario the cutoff energy for the effective interaction between charge - carriers is given by @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 is the energy of the van hove singularity and @xmath34 is a characteristic phonon energy ) @xcite . if the cutoff energy is given by @xmath76 and is thus electronic in origin , @xmath0 displays no shift upon isotopic substitution . taking into account the coulomb repulsion it has been shown@xcite that one can even obtain a negative ic .",
    "another way to extend the results presented earlier is to consider an anisotropic eliashberg coupling function @xmath77 .",
    "generally it is assumed that the system is isotropic and the coupling function can be averaged over the fermi surface , leading to a * q*-independent eliashberg function .",
    "if the system is strongly anisotropic ( as is the case of high-@xmath0 superconductors ) , the average may not lead to an accurate description of the situation .",
    "the isotope effect has been studied for different * q*-dependent form factors entering @xmath78 in ref .",
    "they show that a small isotope coefficient as observed in yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 can be obtained for anisotropic systems .",
    "nevertheless , to obtain high critical temperatures at the same time , they are forced to introduced another , electronic pairing mechanism .",
    "such a situation is further discussed below ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : nonph ] ) .",
    "note that the theories presented in this section give only a qualitative picture of the situation encountered in high - temperature superconductors and do presently not account for the isotope effect observed in various systems ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "until now we focused mainly on the study of monoatomic systems in which the attractive interaction leading to the formation of pairs is mediated by phonons .",
    "all previous effects are naturally also encountered in polyatomic systems .",
    "however , the presence of two or more elements in the composition of a superconductor has several direct consequences for the isotope effect that we summarize in the following .",
    "the first consequence of a polyatomic system is that the characteristic frequency @xmath34 which determines the value of @xmath0 depends on the mass of the different ions involved @xmath79 .",
    "obviously , the dependence @xmath80 for element @xmath81 must not be equal to @xmath82 .",
    "it is thus not surprising if the partial isotope coefficient ( obtained by substituting one type of ions for its isotope ; see eq .",
    "( [ icdelta ] ) ) differs from the textbook value @xmath32 .",
    "let us consider the example of a cubic lattice with alternating masses @xmath83 and @xmath84@xcite . the acoustic and optical branches can be calculated analytically@xcite . from this one",
    "obtains the following partial isotope coefficients : @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "the upper sign stands for the debye frequency and the lower sign has to be considered when the characteristic frequency is given by the optical phonon .",
    "@xmath88 is the sum of the force constants and @xmath89 ( @xmath90 for the optical branch and @xmath91 for acoustic mode ; @xmath92 is the lattice constant ) .",
    "one notes that the total isotope coefficient is given by @xmath93 whether one takes the acoustical or the optical phonon as the characteristic energy for the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "given the previous result , one can ask if there exists a maximal value of the ic .",
    "it is often stated in the literature that @xmath32 is the maximal value that the isotope coefficient can reach within a harmonic phonon , and electron - phonon induced pairing model .",
    "although to the knowledge of the authors none of the systems studied so far seems to contradict this assertion , one should note that there is no proof of this statement .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for a polyatomic system @xmath94 ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ ictcpartial ] ) ) _ if _ one assumes that @xmath36 and all masses of the unit cell are subject to _ the same _ isotopic shift ( i.e. , @xmath95 takes the same constant value for each element @xmath24 of the system , see eq .",
    "( [ ictcpartial ] ) ) .",
    "these assumptions hold approximately for certain systems as , e.g. , the chevrel - phase mo@xmath96se@xmath97 material@xcite , but are certainly not valid for example in high - temperature superconductors .",
    "it is thus not clear if the _ total _ isotope coefficient , eq .",
    "( [ ictcpartial ] ) , is indeed always @xmath32 .",
    "the general proof of such a statement requires the knowledge of the polarization vectors and their derivatives with respect to the isotopic masses , both of which have to be calculated for each specific system studied .",
    "another important remark concerns the value of the ( very small ) ic for optimally doped high-@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "experimentally one measures generally the partial oxygen isotope effect ( in some cases also the cu and ba ie ) .",
    "since the unit cell of a high - temperature superconductor contains many different atoms , one expects values of the partial ic that are significantly smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "a crude estimate can be given by observing that under the assumption of a same contribution of each atom to the isotope coefficient ( which is certainly not the case as mentioned above ) the value of the isotope effect for oxygen in ybco would be @xmath98 , where @xmath67 is the number of atoms per unit cells ( @xmath99 in the case of ybco ) . since there are @xmath100 oxygen atoms in the unit cell , one should multiply @xmath101 by this number .    if , in addition to the multiatomic structure of the system , one takes into account the effect of coulomb interactions and/or the fact that the charge - carriers may strongly couple to certain phonons only one can obtain values of the order observed in high - temperature oxides .",
    "the second possibility has for example been studied in the context of the chevrel - phase compound mo@xmath96se@xmath97@xcite or organic superconductors@xcite .",
    "it has also been studied for high-@xmath0 superconductors in ref .",
    "they conclude that the oxygen isotope effect can be well described for reasonable parameters in the case of la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 , but that unphysical values of the coupling have to be considered to describe the partial oxygen isotope effect of yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "a careful study of the effect of coulomb interactions on the ie of high-@xmath0 superconductors has not been done yet .    on thus concludes from the previous considerations that it is not impossible to explain the small values of the ic observed in conjuction with high @xmath0 s in high - temperature materials , if one considers the combined effect of a polyatomic system , the coulomb interaction and the band structure .",
    "anharmonic effects play an important role in materials such as pdh(d)@xcite , mo@xmath96se@xmath97@xcite or , according to some theories@xcite , in high - temperature superconductors . among other consequences",
    "the presence of anharmonicities affects the value of the isotope coefficient .",
    "we present here two different aspects of the anharmonic isotope effect : anharmonicity of the characteristic phonon mode ( for pdh ) and volume effects ( for molybdenum ) .",
    "quantities that are independent of ionic masses in the harmonic approximation , can become mass dependent in the presence of anharmonicity .",
    "we mention three such properties that are of interest for the isotope effect in superconductors : the lattice force constants @xmath102@xcite , the unit - cell volume @xcite and the electron - phonon coupling function @xmath45@xcite . in the first case , it was shown that the account of coulomb interactions alone ( see above ) can not explain the inverse ( @xmath103 ) hydrogen isotope effect observed in pdh ( see table 1 ) . on the other hand",
    ", a change of @xmath104 of the lattice force constants when replacing h for deuterium ( d ) in pdh was infered from neutron - scattering data@xcite .",
    "this results from large zero - point motion of h as compared to d. taking this fact into account in the eliashberg formalism allows one to obtain quantitative agreement with the experiment@xcite .",
    "another effect due to the presence of anharmonicity is the isotopic volume effect@xcite .",
    "this effect was discussed in the context of molybdene and is related to the difference in zero - point motion of the two isotopes . in such a system",
    "one can write the ic as @xmath105 with @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the bulk modulus , @xmath108 is the pressure and @xmath109 is the volume difference induced by isotopic substitution . in the case of molybdenum",
    "the volume isotope effect amounts to @xmath110 and accounts for @xmath111 of the total isotope coefficient , which is not a negligible effect .",
    "the presence of a volume isotope effect has also been suggested in the case of pdh , c@xmath112 materials as well as in pb@xcite .",
    "the other major effect of anharmonicity is the appearence of an ionic - mass dependent electron - phonon coupling function @xmath45@xcite . in this case",
    "not only the prefactor @xmath34 of eq .",
    "( [ tcbcs ] ) , but also the exponent depends on ionic masses . as stressed earlier in the context of band structure effects , this fact can lead to a strong deviation from @xmath113 , even for monoatomic systems .",

    "regarding high-@xmath0 superconductors , the anharmonic model could explain qualitatively the behaviour of the isotope coefficient if one considers the fact that the coupling function @xmath45 also depends on doping ( see ref .",
