    "the weak order first introduced by melnikov and well studied in @xcite due its strong connections to kazhdan - lusztig and geometric order on standard young tableaux , where the latter are induced from the representation theory of special linear algebra and symmetric group .",
    "we have the following inclusion among all of these three orders : @xmath4 the fact that its definition uses just the combinatorics of tableaux such as knuth relations and the weak order on symmetric group , gives the weak order an important place among these orders . on the other hand the only justification for its well - definedness is induced from above inclusion ,",
    "in other words there is no self contained proof of this basic fact .",
    "our aim here is to bring the attention to the following conjecture on the weak order ( which is first asked in @xcite ) , called the property of _ inner tableau translation_. this property is known to be satisfied by kazhdan - lusztig and geometric orders and its importance on the weak order relies on the fact that it provides a self contained proof for the well - definedness of this order",

    "the resulting tableau is then @xmath23 and recording tableau @xmath28 is found by filling this new cell in @xmath29 with the number @xmath30 .",
