    "many important algebras arising in representation theory ( hecke algebras , universal enveloping algebras , etc . ) have a geometric description based on convolution products .    besides their intrinsic interest , realizing an algebra in terms of convolution allows for a geometric understanding of the representation theory of that algebra , in particular , the construction of collections of standard and costandard modules , indicating the existence of an interesting representation theory along the lines of highest weight categories or quasi - hereditary algebras .",
    "this approach has been applied with great success to the representation theory of weyl groups , hecke algebras of various flavors and universal enveloping algebras , as is ably documented in the book of chriss and ginzburg @xcite .    using 2-block springer fibers we present a construction of a family of convolution algebras with a somewhat different nature than the above examples ( see section  [ sec : convolution - algebras ] for a precise description ) . with a certain specific choice of parameters and the two jordan blocks of the same size",
    ", the algebra is related to the ext - algebra of certain _ coherent sheaves _ on a resolution of the corresponding slodowy slice and to a graphically defined algebra , called the _ arc algebra _ @xmath2 , introduced by khovanov @xcite . for the general 2-jordan - block case ( not necessarily equally sized ) , we establish an isomorphism to the more general version of the arc algebra as introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our construction is built on a careful explicit geometric and combinatorial analysis of the geometry of the springer fiber and its components .",
    "apart from the 2-jordan - block case , the structure of irreducible components of springer fibers is not sufficiently well understood to generalize this construction , though significant progress on the structure of components and their intersections has been achieved in the square - zero ( i.e. two column ) case studied in @xcite , in addition to the 2-jordan - block case studied here .",
    "+ khovanov used his arc algebra to define a categorification of the jones polynomial ( @xcite ) , followed by a representation theoretic categorification of the jones polynomial and the reshetikhin - turaev @xmath3-tangle invariant obtained by the first author in @xcite .",
    "the choice of jordan block sizes corresponds there to a choice of a specific weight space in a tensor product of many copies of the natural @xmath3-module , hence naturally extends the case of two blocks of the same size .",
    "it is known that after restriction to a suitable subcategory , this categorification of the jones polynomial agrees with khovanov s ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , cautis and kamnitzer ( @xcite ) used the geometry of spaces connected with two - row springer fibers to define a related knot homology theory using certain categories of coherent sheaves , whereas seidel , smith @xcite and manolescu @xcite constructed a symplectic version of khovanov homology using a certain fukaya category connected to the springer fibres of interest to us .",
    "our convolution algebra construction is motivated by both of these constructions , though perhaps more strongly the latter .",
    "more precisely , the cohomology of the intersection of two components in our picture should be seen in analogy to the morphism space between two ( compact ) lagrangian submanifolds in @xcite and one of our main results will be the definition of a convolution product structure on the direct sum of all these morphism spaces mimicking the composition of morphisms in the fukaya category . + we hope that our description of the convolution algebra will ultimately shed some light on the connection between the algebraic - representation theoretic categorification and the geometric ones . in particular , we expect that , with the correct identifications , the algebras appearing in all three contexts are isomorphic , establishing some rather surprising equivalences of categories ( see section [ sec : coher - sheav - comp ] for results in this direction ) .",
    "+ an analogous construction associating an algebra to a hypertoric variety has been developed by the second author with braden , licata and proudfoot ( @xcite ) . like the algebra",
    "we define , this hypertoric algebra is quasi - hereditary and moreover koszul ( which is known to be true for our algebra as well , @xcite ) .",
    "the koszul dual of this hypertoric algebra is the algebra associated via this convolution construction to the gale dual hypertoric variety .",
    "+ let us outline the content of the paper in more detail . for any nilpotent endomorphism @xmath4 of @xmath5",
    ", we have the following ( in general , not smooth ) subvariety of the full flag variety , which only depends ( up to isomorphism ) on the conjugacy class of @xmath4 :    the * springer fiber * of a nilpotent map @xmath6 is the variety of all complete flags @xmath7 in @xmath5 fixed under @xmath4 ( i.e. for any space @xmath8 of the flag @xmath7 , we have that @xmath9 ) .",
    "we can always naturally associate a springer fiber with any parabolic subalgebra @xmath10 of @xmath11 containing the standard borel of all upper triangular matrices : given @xmath10 , we have a composition of @xmath12 which , in turn , determines a jordan type , hence a nilpotent conjugacy class in @xmath13 .",
    "more canonically , this is a regular nilpotent in the levi of @xmath10 . in the present paper ,",
    "we restrict to the case where @xmath4 is nilpotent with two jordan blocks ( i.e.  where @xmath10 is maximal or , equivalently , @xmath14 ) .",
    "+ in sections [ sec : irred - comp - their][sec : pairw - inters - stable ] , we will concentrate on combinatorial and geometric preliminaries .",
    "we first recall the description of irreducible components of these springer fibers ( following @xcite ) , and more generally consider the closure of cells in the biaynicki - birula paving of the springer fiber . for all such closures ,",
    "we verify fung s conjecture that pairwise intersections of such are smooth , iterated @xmath15-bundles and explicitly determine their cohomology rings as quotients of the cohomology ring of the full flag variety .",
    "+ then , in section  [ sec : convolution - algebras ] , we equip the direct sum of all these cohomologies ( with appropriate grading shifts ) with a non - commutative convolution product which turns it into a finite dimensional graded algebra @xmath16 . in the case where the two jordan blocks have the same size ,",
    "the underlying vector space is isomorphic to the one underlying khovanov s arc algebra .",
    "for all block lengths , we obtain the vector spaces underlying the generalized versions of khovanov algebras .",
    "the generalized versions of khovanov s algebra have a quasi - hereditary cover @xmath17 described by the first author in @xcite and now sometimes called ks - algebras . for a detailed description and further properties of these generalized khovanov algebras and their representation theory , we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we construct a quasi - hereditary cover @xmath18 of our first convolution algebra using a biaynicki - birula paving of the springer fiber , with respect to a generic cocharacter of the maximal torus commuting with @xmath4 .",
    "the set of fixed points for this torus action are in natural bijection with the idempotents in the algebra @xmath2 ( and hence with indecomposable projective modules in the parabolic category @xmath19 or in the quasi - hereditary cover of the generalized arc algebra ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath20 the closures of biaynicki - birula cells .",
    "( in our special case these can also be viewed as the stable manifolds under the morse flow of the moment map of this cocharacter or as the closure of a fixed point attracting set ) . taking cohomology over @xmath21 ,",
    "we show that @xmath22 can be equipped with a convolution algebra structure which is a ( non - negatively ) @xmath23-graded algebra after appropriate grading shifts @xmath24 indicated on the right hand side .",
    "+ we then show the main result of our paper .    the algebra @xmath16 ( resp . the extended version @xmath18 ) and the generalized arc algebra @xmath2 ( resp .",
    "its quasi - hereditary cover @xmath25 ) are isomorphic as graded algebras .    note that by ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3 ) the category of @xmath2-modules is equivalent to the category of _ perverse sheaves _ on a grassmannian ( constructible with respect to the schubert stratification ) .",
    "hence this algebra actually has two geometric realizations , one arising from constructable sheaves , and one which seems to be related to the fukaya category and coherent sheaves .    since the ks - algebras are the endomorphism rings of certain projectives in parabolic category @xmath19 , by koszul duality ( * ?",
    "* theorem 1.1.3 ) , this is isomorphic to an @xmath26-algebra of simple modules in a singular block of category @xmath27 corresponding to a weight precisely fixed by @xmath28 ( in the so - called dot - action ) .",
    "this theorem then suggests that we have an embedding of this singular category @xmath27 into the fukaya category of the slodowy slice @xmath29 . in this way one might hope for a direct connection with the construction in @xcite .",
    "+ finally in section  [ sec : coher - sheav - comp ] , we consider how our model ( and thus , indirectly , the ks - algebra and category @xmath30 ) is related to the sheaf - theoretic model of khovanov homology given by cautis and kamnitzer @xcite .",
    "to each crossingless matching @xmath31 ( that means to each primitive idempotent in khovanov s arc algebra ) their model associates a certain coherent sheaf @xmath32 on a certain compact smooth variety related with slodowy slices .",
    "the variety naturally contains the springer fiber we had considered previously , and the sheaves in question are supported on the component we associated with @xmath33 . as our notation suggest",
    ", these sheaves arise from square roots of canonical bundles ( theorem  [ funcck ] ) .",
    "we show that , as a vector space , the ext - algebra of these sheaves can be identified with our algebra @xmath16 ( and thus also with khovanov s algebra ) :    with the notation in section  [ sec : coher - sheav - comp ] there is an isomorphism of graded vector spaces @xmath34    we have not been able to determine whether the yoneda product on this space is isomorphic to the arc algebra @xmath2",
    ". obviously , this would be a very interesting question to resolve .",
    "it might be a first step to solve the question of whether the functorial tangle invariants of cautis and kamnitzer ( @xcite ) can be identified with the functorial tangle invariants of khovanov ( @xcite ) and ( equivalently ) of the second author ( @xcite ) .",
    "the half - densities @xmath35 are simple objects in the heart @xmath36 of a certain @xmath37-structure on the category of coherent sheaves on a smooth compact space @xmath38 .",
    "this space is a certain compactification of the pre - image under the springer resolution of a normal slice to the nilpotent orbit through @xmath4 at @xmath4 .",
    "we describe the other simple objects in this heart , and show that it carries a highest - weight structure with the same kazhdan - lusztig polynomials as the corresponding highest weight ks - algebra , say @xmath39 .",
    "there is an isomorphism between @xmath36 and the category of finite dimensional modules over the algebra @xmath39 .",
    "the authors would like to thank richard thomas , joel kamnitzer , daniel huybrechts , tom braden , roman bezrukavnikov , and clark barwick for their insight and suggestions .",
    "we are grateful to the referee for many detailed comments and in particular to mohammed abouzaid and ivan smith for pointing out a mistake in a previous version of the paper .",
    "both authors would like to thank the institute of advanced study where most of this research was carried out .",
    "in the following , all vector spaces and cohomologies are defined over @xmath21 .",
    "we abbreviate @xmath40 .",
    "an _ algebra _ will always be a unitary associative @xmath41-algebra .",
    "graded vector space _ will always be @xmath23-graded . for a graded vector space @xmath42 and @xmath43",

    "@xmath62 which is invariant under @xmath63",
    "in order to describe the irreducible components of @xmath57 , we will first have to define some combinatorial machinery .",
    "this section will cover a number of results from the article of fung @xcite , which will be necessary for later .    a * standard tableau * is a filling of the young diagram of a partition such that the rows and columns are strictly decreasing ( read from the top left corner ) .    a * crossingless matching * is a planar diagram consisting of @xmath12 points , @xmath64 cups , and @xmath65 rays pointing directly downward such that each point is attached to exactly one cup or ray , cups only pass below points , not above them , and no cup or ray crosses any other .",
    "we say that a point at the end of a cup is * matched * and one at the end of a ray is * orphaned*.    given any standard tableau @xmath66 of shape @xmath48 , we can associate a crossingless matching @xmath67 of @xmath12 points , numbered from left to the right , such that the bottom row of the tableau contains all the numbers which are at the left end of a cup , and the top row of the diagram contains all the numbers which are at the right endpoint of a cup , or are the endpoint of a ray .",
