    "in this article will be presented some modifications of the following classical theorem of e.  beltrami according to which the space forms are distinguished among all other riemannian manifolds by the fundamental property of admitting local diffeomorphisms to a euclidean space under which the geodesics correspond @xcite .    a riemannian manifold which can be mapped onto a space of constant riemannian curvature with correspondence of geodesics , has itself constant riemannian curvature .",
    "consequently each of these two manifolds can be locally embedded as either a hyperplane not passing through the origin in a euclidean space , or a hypersphere centred at the origin in a euclidean space , or the standard embedding of a hyperbolic space in a lorentz - minkowski space as a hyperquadric centred at the origin .",
    "now a diffeomorphism between these manifolds preserves the geodesics if and only if it originates by central projection from an affine transformation between these pseudo - euclidean spaces which maps the centre to the centre .",
    "the question , whether the above theorem remains valid for diffeomorphism between riemannian manifolds which preserve some other naturally defined classes of submanifolds , is a first main topic of this text .",
    "therefore it seems of interest to introduce the following uniformous terminology : a diffeomorphism between two riemannian manifolds will be said to be    * _ cogeodesical _ , if it preserves the geodesics .",
    "this name should be compared with the nomenclature _",
    "collineations _ from classical projective geometry .",
    "we will not use the terms `` geodesic '' or `` projective ; '' * _ concircular _ , if it preserves the geodesic circles ; * _ cospherical _ , if it preserves the geodesic hyperspheres ; * _ cominimal _ , if it preserves the minimal hypersurfaces .",
    "_ in the first part _ of this article , some known facts on concircular diffeomorphisms will be presented as the concircular theorem of beltrami .",
    "_ in the second part , _ it will be shown that a riemannian manifold which admits a cospherical diffeomorphism onto a space of constant riemannian curvature , has itself constant riemannian curvature .",
    "moreover , for spaces of constant riemannian curvature , the class of cospherical diffeomorphisms coincides with the class of concircular diffeomorphisms .",
    "_ in the third part , _ cominimal diffeomorphisms between three - dimensional riemannian manifolds are studied .",
    "it should be remarked that the class of minimal surfaces in a given three - dimensional riemannian manifold depends on an _ infinity _ of parameters , whereas the three other classes merely constitute a finite - dimensional class of submanifolds .",
    "therefore , prescribing all minimal surfaces for a riemannian metric on a three - dimensional manifold seems a very severe restriction .",
    "it will be shown indeed that except for homotheties there do not exist cominimal diffeomorphisms .",
    "_ in the last part _ will be given an infinitesimal version of beltrami s theorem , which is the second main topic of the text .",
    "first , the concept of an _ infinitesimally cogeodesical deformation _ is defined , and a lemma which analytically translates this geometrical definition is presented (  [ sec : def_infproj],[sec : lem_infproj ] ) . from this",
    "we can already prove the intended infinitesimal theorem of beltrami in the two - dimensional case (  [ sec : two_dim ] ) ; in fact , the proof which is presented here is merely a small adaption of the proof of the classical theorem as it appears in , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "as such this proof is merely a technical calculation , which is straightforward but not well - suited for a higher - dimensional generalisation .    a proof of the same result which holds for any dimension is essentially based on the known fact that the equation which describes all metrics which share their geodesics with a given metric , can be rewritten as a linear equation",
    "this bridge between the `` finite '' and the `` infinitesimal '' problem of cogeodesical equivalence is the key element of the proof of the corresponding theorem for arbitrary dimensions ( thm .",
    "[ thm : inf_beltrami_arbdim ] in  [ sec : arb_dim ] ) .",
    "all manifolds are assumed to be connected .",
    "we will say that a riemannian manifold has _ constant riemannian curvature _ if the sectional curvature along a tangent plane is a constant which depends neither on the footpoint nor on the direction of the chosen tangent plane .",
    "we will use the term _ pointwise constant sectional curvature _ if , at every fixed point , it is independent of the direction .",
    "we will use the following sign convention concerning the riemann curvature tensor of a riemannian manifold @xmath0 : if @xmath1 stands for the levi - civita connection , then @xmath2}x-\\nabla_v \\left(\\nabla_w x\\right ) + \\nabla_w\\left ( \\nabla_v x\\right)$ ] .",
    "the _ hessian operator _ of a function @xmath3 on a riemannian manifold @xmath0 is defined as @xmath4 here we have denoted @xmath5 for the set of all vector fields on @xmath6 .",
    "the directional derivative of a function @xmath7 along a vector field @xmath8 will be denoted by @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "by definition , a _ geodesic circle _ in a riemannian manifold is a curve for which the first geodesic curvature is constant and the second geodesic curvature vanishes .",

    "the theorem below follows from @xcite ,  c.    if a concircular diffeomorphism @xmath10 between two riemannian manifolds , one of which has constant riemannian curvature , exists , then this diffeomorphism is conformal and both spaces have constant riemannian curvature .",

    "the same conclusion holds , but it is now a consequence of a result of carathodory @xcite .",
    "of course , every diffeomorphism @xmath10 the co - ordinate representation of which is a mbius transformation will be concircular .",
    "it can be remarked that the stereographic projection from part of the sphere @xmath23 to a hyperplane is such a co - ordinate system @xmath24 in which the spherical metric is represented in the form ( [ eq : riem_form ] ) .",

    "the origin of the problem is a similar flaw in the sentence after @xcite , prop .",
    "we now ask whether beltrami s theorem can likewise be adapted to the _ geodesic hyperspheres _ , these being defined as the distance hyperspheres , _",
    "i.e. _ , the loci of all points which are separated a certain distance @xmath27 from a certain point @xmath28 .",

    "( ii.)*assume now that the initial curvature @xmath271 is a strictly positive constant .",
    "it is no restriction to assume that @xmath0 is the unit sphere , with metric given by @xmath272 .",
    "the proof of the theorem is more technical in this case because we will need the formulae expressing the variation of the christoffel symbols in terms of the variation of the metric .",

    "the fact that @xmath208 is an infinitesimally cogeodesical deformation precisely means that ( [ eq : xx ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath278 by applying the operator @xmath279 to both sides of each of the four equations ( [ eq : kgij ] ) , which are generally valid , the following information results : @xmath280 a combination of ( [ eq : deltakgij].ii.)+2@xmath281([eq : deltakgij].iii . ) , the expressions for @xmath282 and ( [ eq : tsja ] ) results in the following ordinary differential equation for @xmath283 w.r.t .",

    "the next lemma , which can be seen as a mere rephrasing of the previous lemma because of the relation ( [ eq : xsigma ] ) between the tensors @xmath204 and @xmath44 , gives a similar characterisation by means of the tensor @xmath244 .",

    "according to lemma [ lem : beltrami2 ] , the tensor @xmath244 as defined in ( [ eq : alphalambda ] ) satisfies the linear equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , and consequently the same applies for the tensor @xmath293 and this for every @xmath109 .",
