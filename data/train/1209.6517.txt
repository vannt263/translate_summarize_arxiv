    "entanglement plays an important role in the current quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "most quantum information protocols such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum state sharing @xcite and other protocols @xcite need the entanglement to set up the quantum channel . among all the entanglement forms ,",
    "the single - particle entanglement with the form @xmath0 may be the simplest one . here",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 mean none particle and one particle , respectively , and the subscripts @xmath3 and @xmath4 mean different locations .",
    "the single - photon entangled state corresponds to a superposition state in which the single photon is in two different locations @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in 2002 , lombardi _ et al .",
    "_ reported their experimental results for teleportating a vacuum - one - photon qubit with the fidelity of 0.953 @xcite .",
    "in 2005 , chou _",
    "et al . _ realized the experiment for observing the entanglement between two atomic ensembles located in distant , spatially separated set - ups .",
    "it is essentially the creation of entanglement by storing the single - photon entanglement into the atomic - ensemble - based quantum memory @xcite .",
    "the most important application of the single - photon entanglement may be the quantum repeater protocol in long - distance quantum communication .",
    "for example , in the well known duan - lukin - cirac - zoller ( dlcz ) repeater protocol @xcite , with one pair source and one quantum memory at each location , the quantum repeater can entangle two remote locations a and b. it can be written as @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the excited state and the ground state of the atomic ensembles , respectively .",
    "recently , gottesman _",
    "proposed a protocol for building an interferometric telescope based on the single - photon entangledstate@xcite . with the help of the single - photon entanglement , the protocol has the potential to eliminate the baseline length limit , and allows in principle the interferometers with arbitrarily long baselines .",
    "unfortunately , in the practical transmission , similar to the other types of entanglement , the noisy environment and the imperfect operation may make the maximally single - photon entangled state degrade into a mixed state or become a pure less - entangled state .",
    "for example , the relative phase between the different spatial modes is sensitive to the path - length instabilities @xcite .",
    "it has become an inherent drawback in quantum repeaters which can make the long - distance quantum communication extremely difficult . in the single - photon entanglement ,",
    "the sensitive phase fluctuation cause a phase - flip error on the maximally entangled state , which will make the single - photon entangled state @xmath0 become @xmath8 . in 2008 ,",
    "the group of gisin proposed an effective protocol for the purification of single - photon entanglement with linear optics @xcite , which was realized in experiment by themselves in 2010 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , as pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite , as we can not ensure the pair sources which are excited by the synchronized classical pumping pulses have the same probability to generate the single photon , after the entanglement generation , it may also lead the less - entangled state with the form of @xmath9 , with @xmath10 . in the entanglement connection stage , if we use such less - entangled states @xmath9 and @xmath11 to connect the entanglement with the entanglement swapping , we will obtain the lesser quality quantum entanglement channel @xmath12@xcite .",
    "so before entanglement connection , we need to recover the less - entangled state into the maximally entangled state .",
    "entanglement concentration is a powerful way to recover the pure less - entangled state into a maximally entangled state probabilistically @xcite .",
    "most entanglement concentration protocols ( ecps ) are focused on the two - particle entanglement , such as the schimidit projection method @xcite , the ecp based on the entanglement swapping @xcite , the ecp using unitary transformation @xcite , and the ecps with linear optics and cross - kerr nonlinearity @xcite . in 2009 , we have proposed an ecp for single - photon entanglement with the help of cross - kerr nonlinearity @xcite . in that protocol , after the two parties alice and bob pick up the successful case , they should send the photon in the spatial mode @xmath13 to make a collective measurement .",
    "moreover , during each concentration step , they require two pairs of nonlocal single - photon entanglement states and after the measurement at least one pair of entangled state can be remained .",
    "so it is not strange that the protocol has higher efficiency than others .",
    "though the protocol of ref .",
    "@xcite can reach a higher success probability than the protocol of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is not an optimal one .",
    "the main reason is that the protocol is not based on the local operation and classical communication ( locc ) . on the other hand , in order to obtain a higher success probability , it requires the phase shift of the coherent state to reach a large value of @xmath14 in the single - photon level . however , natural cross - kerr nonlinearities are extremely weak , which makes it difficult to realize the protocol under current experimental conditions @xcite .    in this paper , we present two efficient ecps for less - entangled single - photon state with local single photon .",
    "both protocols only require one less - entangled single - photon state and a conventional single photon . in the first protocol ,",
    "we use the linear optical elements to complete the task and it can reach the same success probability as ref . @xcite . in the second protocol ,",
    "we adopt the weak cross - kerr nonlinearity to improve the first ecp .",
    "the second protocol can get a higher success probability as it can be reused to further concentrate the discarded items in the first protocol .",
    "this advantage makes it more feasible than others . certainly , in order to perform both the protocols successfully",
    ", we should know the initial coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 to prepare the state of single photon .",
    "actually , in the previous ecps in refs.@xcite , they also need to the initial coefficients . in a practical operation",
    ", one can measure the enough samples to obtain the exact values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "the most important element is the cross - kerr nonlinearity . in the practical applications ,",
    "the cross - kerr nonlinearity has been regarded as a controversial topic for a long time @xcite , for during the homodyne detection process , decoherence is inevitable , which may lead the qubit states degrade to the mixed states @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the natural cross - kerr nonlinearity is extremely weak so that it is difficult to determine the phase shift due to the impossible discrimination of two overlapping coherent states in homodyne detection @xcite .",
    "fortunately , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , we can make the decoherence extremely weak , simply by an arbitrary strong coherent state associated with a displacement d(@xmath83 ) performed on the coherent state .",
    "moreover , several theoretical works have proved that with the help of weak measurement , it is possible for the phase shift to reach an observable value @xcite .",

    "we can obtain the success probability in each concentration round , which can be written as @xmath84    ) for obtaining a maximally single - photon entangled state after the concentration protocol being operated for n times . for numerical simulation , we choose @xmath85 .",

    "therefore , the essence of the entanglement concentration is the entanglement transformation .",
    "the entanglement of the concentrated state comes from the initial less - entangled state . if the entanglement of the initial less - entangled state is low , the total success probability for obtaining the maximally entangled state is also small .",
    "in conclusion , we have put forward two efficient ecps for distilling the maximally single - photon entangled state with an auxiliary single photon . in these two ecps ,",
    "the auxiliary photon is only possessed by bob .",
