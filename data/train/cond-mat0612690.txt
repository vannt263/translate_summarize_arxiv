    "strong correlations between electrons play a fundamental role in the cuprates .",
    "in fact , there is ample evidence for a crossover from a doped mott insulator to a correlated fermi liquid , as holes are introduced into the cuo@xmath4 planes .",
    "two limiting regimes can be described in simple terms , an antiferromagnetic mott insulator at half filling ( @xmath5 ) and a rather conventional fermi liquid at high doping levels ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "many difficult problems remain to be solved , especially concerning the nature of the underdoped region ( the so - called pseudogap phase ) , the normal phase around optimal doping ( `` marginal fermi liquid '' ) and the `` physical mechanism '' leading to the superconducting phase for @xmath7 . in this note we discuss two specific issues : on the one hand , the nature of the crossover between the underdoped and the overdoped regimes , on the other hand , the possibility of superconductivity originating from purely repulsive interactions .",
    "we use variational wave functions for the one - band hubbard model in two dimensions , keeping in mind that both the model and the method do provide insight , but at the same time are not sufficient for developing a complete theory of the layered cuprates .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian @xmath8 is composed of two terms with conflicting tendencies , the hopping term @xmath9 where @xmath10 creates an electron at site @xmath11 with spin @xmath12 , and the number of doubly occupied sites @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the notation @xmath15 means that hopping is restricted to neighboring sites .",
    "if the on - site repulsion @xmath0 vanishes , the electrons occupy delocalized bloch orbitals and set up a filled fermi sea in the ground state @xmath16 , given by @xmath17 in contrast , for a vanishing hopping amplitude @xmath18 ( and @xmath19 , or for finite @xmath18 and @xmath20 ) , the ground state @xmath21 for @xmath22 electrons is an arbitrary superposition of configurations where the electrons are localized on lattice sites without any double occupancy , @xmath23 for finite values of @xmath0 and @xmath18 the delocalizing tendency of @xmath18 and the localizing tendency of @xmath0 compete .",
    "one expects a crossover to occur around some critical value @xmath24 between a ground state linked to @xmath16 for @xmath25 and one linked to @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "this picture is captured by two types of variational wave functions , the gutzwiller ansatz @xcite @xmath28 and @xmath29 are variational parameters . depending on the relative values of the minima of @xmath30 one or the other of the two ground states",
    "is favored .",
    "for the case of a half - filled band , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the total number of sites ) , the two variational states defined above can be distinguished by their sensitivity with respect to changes in boundary conditions . using an early argument of kohn @xcite",
    ", it can be readily shown that @xmath33 is metallic ( the drude weight is finite ) and @xmath34 is insulating ( vanishing drude weight ) @xcite .",
    "thus the delocalization - localization crossover manifests itself in this approach as a sharp ( mott ) metal - insulator transition at a critical value @xmath35 , which turns out to be of the order of the bandwidth .",
    "the distinction between the two regimes is blurred if we allow for antiferromagnetic ordering , which is expected to set in at arbitrarily small @xmath0 for the square lattice . in this case",
    ", a possible signature would be the size of the local moment , which is small in the `` delocalized '' spin - density - wave regime at small @xmath0 , increases strongly in the crossover regime and saturates for @xmath20 .",
    "the insulating cuprates can be well understood in terms of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , the strong coupling limit of the half - filled hubbard model , provided that ring exchange around the plaquettes is also included .",
    "the presence of this term indicates that @xmath0 is not much larger than the bandwidth .",
    "in fact , the analysis of the spin waves observed in neutron scattering experiments yields a value of @xmath0 of the order of @xmath36 ( twice the bandwidth ) @xcite . according to our variational analysis this puts these materials inside the localized regime , but",
    "not so far that double occupancy can be simply discarded . at half filling , cuprates can thus be considered as `` weakly localized '' mott insulators . the good agreement between theoretical predictions made on the basis of the ( two - dimensional ) hubbard model and the observed magnetic exitation spectrum in the layered cuprates does not imply that long - range coulomb interactions are absent in these materials ; these are just not seen at half filling .",
    "the addition of non - local coulomb terms would essentially lead to slightly different exchange constants .",
    "an interesting and largely unexplored issue is the location of the crossover regime ( as a function of @xmath0 ) away from half filling .",
    "the variational procedure should also be useful in this limit , although the presence of holes poses an additional challenge .",
    "the distinction between the localized and delocalized regimes is less clear - cut for @xmath37 than it is at half filling because the drude weight is expected to remain finite due to the motion of holes .",
    "a further complication arises from the fact that the hubbard hamiltonian represents an effective model , in which many degrees of freedom are subsumed in some average way by the parameters .",
    "quite generally , we expect that screening will become more and more efficient as doping is increased and thus will lead to a reduced value of @xmath0 .",
    "the appearance of a conventional fermi liquid above a hole concentration of about 25% agrees with such a picture .",
    "the celebrated bcs theory of superconductivity is based on an effective attraction between electrons , caused by phonon exchange .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that the application of the bcs mean - field approximation to the repulsive hubbard model does not yield any energy gain due to a pairing instability . to see this ,",
    "we decompose the on - site term , @xmath38 and notice that in the absence of antiferromagnetism the first term is just @xmath39 , while the second term vanishes . the third term , responsible for a superconducting instability in bcs theory , is nonnegative , positive for an order parameter with @xmath40-wave symmetry and zero for @xmath1-wave symmetry .",
    "we conclude that in the bcs approximation superconductivity with @xmath1-wave symmetry ( or with other similar order parameters ) is neither promoted nor suppressed by the on - site repulsion .",
    "therefore we have to go beyond the mean - field level to find out whether a superconducting ground state is conceivable in the repulsive hubbard model .",
    "this is a very difficult problem since it necessitates a reliable calculation of the correlation energy .",
    "the question of superconductivity in the repulsive hubbard model ( and the related @xmath18-@xmath41 model ) has been attacked by several different methods , the perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite , numerical calculations of the renormalized scattering vertex @xcite and variational wave functions @xcite .",
    "all these approaches are consistent with @xmath1-wave superconductivity in some doping range , but most of them have a very limited range of applicability .",
    "thus the perturbative rg methods @xcite are only valid for very small values of @xmath0 and can not provide a quantitative answer for the energy gap or the condensation energy .",
    "conversely , studies of the @xmath18-@xmath41 model @xcite can only be applied to the large @xmath0 limit of the hubbard model .",
    "unfortunately , reliable results for the crossover region of the two - dimensional hubbard model are still scarce .",
    "in our own work @xcite we use a variational ansatz , which is a combination of eqs .",
    "( [ gutz ] ) and ( [ db ] ) and constructed in such a way as to approach the crossover region from the fermi liquid side and to allow for a superconducting ground state with @xmath1-wave symmetry ,      here the double occupancy is first partially suppressed ( variational parameter g ) , and subsequently both the hopping of holes and the kinetic exchange are enhanced ( variational parameter h ) .",
    "the additional parameter @xmath29 reduces significantly the total energy , in agreement with similar earlier work @xcite .",
    "the parent state @xmath43 is a bcs state with @xmath1-wave symmetry , _ i.e. , _ @xmath44 with @xmath45 two further variational parameters are included in @xmath43 , the bcs gap @xmath46 and a `` chemical potential '' @xmath47 that allows to fix the average number of electrons .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath47 is not identical to the true chemical potential .",
    "@xmath48 : total energy per site of the gutzwiller - type wave function .",
    "@xmath49 : total energy per site of the refined variational wave function . in both figures",
    "the lower curve corresponds to a precisely fixed number of electrons , while the upper curve represents the `` grand canonical '' case with @xmath47 tuned to represent a fixed average density .",
    "the calculation was carried out on a 8x8 square lattice for @xmath50 and @xmath3.,width=377 ]    the variational parameters are determined by minimizing the total energy ( expectation value of the hamiltonian ) . the natural way to get",
    "this energy for a given density is to project the parent state on a fixed number of electrons , working either in real space or in momentum space , and then to compute the energy using a monte carlo simulation . for the case",
    "@xmath51 ( gutzwiller type wave function ) , the parent state is easily written as a superposition of configurations in real space , where the number of doubly occupied sites @xmath52 is diagonal .",
    "the total energy , given by the lower curve in fig .",
    "[ tot_energy]@xmath48 , has a pronounced minimum around @xmath53 .",
    "the condensation energy is of the order of @xmath54 .",
    "the case @xmath55 is more demanding because the operators @xmath56 and @xmath52 are diagonal with respect to different bases . in a first approach , we have written the bcs state as a superposition of momentum space configurations with a fixed number of electrons .",
    "a discrete hubbard - stratonovich transformation is used to decouple the fermion operators in the gutzwiller projector . the price to pay is a summation over `` ising spin '' configurations , in addition to the summation over the momentum space configurations .",
    "this leads to a weight which is no longer positive definite in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the resulting sign problem becomes severe as the gap becomes large .",
    "the result is represented by the lower curve of fig .",
    "[ tot_energy]@xmath49 . in the range where our results are valid",
    "( do not suffer sign problems ) , the energy first decreases , reaches a minimum at about @xmath57 and then increases . for @xmath58 the average value of the sign is about @xmath59 .",
    "results for larger values of @xmath46 can not be trusted .",
    "an alternative approach is to start with an unprojected parent state ( i.e. , with a fixed `` chemical potential '' instead of a fixed number of electrons ) . in this case",
    "only the summation over `` ising spin '' configurations has to be performed , but the `` chemical potential '' has to be fixed to get the right average density .",
    "interestingly , working with this wave function allows to escape the minus sign problem .",
    "the resulting total energy is represented by the upper curve of fig .",
    "[ tot_energy]@xmath49 .",
    "the qualitative behaviour of the energy is quite different for the unprojected wave function ; the minimum energy is located at @xmath60 !",
    "this result is confirmed by the same calculation carried out for @xmath51 ( see fig .",
    "[ tot_energy]@xmath48 , upper curve ) .",
    "the two approaches should be equivalent in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "unfortunately , for the system size studied so far ( @xmath61 ) , finite size effects seem to be rather large and , especially , lead to two conflicitng results .",
    "larger system sizes together with finite size scaling will be required before we can reach any definite conclusion about the fundamental issue of superconductivity in the repulsive hubbard model .",
