    "the static conductivity of matter in the plasma state can be calculated with some confidence , at least for a number of `` simple '' plasmas , using an entirely first - principles approach @xcite .",
    "comparisons with experiments are available for a wide range of conditions , at least for al plasmas @xcite .",
    "another transport property of great interest is the frequency - dependent conductivity @xmath1 .",
    "optical probes provide a convenient diagnostic tool for this plasma conductivity , and common laser - probe wavelengths , e.g. , 300 - 800 nm , become the window of interest . in fact , many experiments on laser - plasma interactions related to inertial fusion have concentrated on frequency tripled ( with the fundamental @xmath2 at 1@xmath3 m from glass lasers ) light , @xmath4 , 351 nm , while there is also current interest in the @xmath5 ( 527 nm ) regime as an option for indirect - drive ignition@xcite .",
    "normally , if the probe frequency is less than the plasma frequency , the probe photons fail to enter the material and only weakly ionized systems can be accessed . however , the recent development of extremely thin ( `` nanoscale '' ) plasma - slab techniques@xcite , known as idealized - slab plasmas@xcite has made it possible to study dense plasmas with low - frqeuency probes , both in transmission and in reflectivity .",
    "density - functional calculations are of two types .",
    "the first type depends heavily on quantum md ( qmd ) simulations , e.g , car and parrinello treat _ only the electrons _ via kohn - sham theory , while the ion subsystem , explicitly represented by a convenient number @xmath6 ( of the order of @xmath7 32 - 256 ) of ions , is made to evolve in time and an average over millions of configurations is taken . in full quantum monte carlo ( qmc )",
    "simulations@xcite , even kohn - sham theory is not used and hence full qmc is not practical for typical plasma problems .",
    "the second type of dft is typified by our approach where both _ electrons and ions _ are treated by dft , so that both subsystems are described by two coupled `` single - electron '' and `` single - ion '' , hartree - like kohn - sham equations .",
    "the many - body effects ( i.e , many - electron and many - ion effects ) are included through the exchange - correlation or correlation potentials .",
    "this allows an enormous simplification in the numerical work involved .",
    "these equations may be further reduced to extremely simpilified thomas - fermi approaches yielding approximate results for plasma properties which are within an order of magnitude of the more refined results , even in unfavourable cases@xcite .",
    "the general optical conductivity problem is essentially the same as that of opacity calculations for warm dense matter@xcite .",
    "however , here we approach it from the static - conductivity ( @xmath8 ) regime , and take account of free - free processes as well as shallow bound states which may exist .",
    "the static - conductivity provides an evaluation of the dynamic conductivity near @xmath2 = 0 via the basic drude formula which assumes a constant relaxation time @xmath9 , taken to be the _ static _ collision time @xmath10 .",
    "hence our task can be stated as follows :    1 .",
    "calculation of the static resistivity .",
    "this involves the following steps : 1 .",
    "calculate the kohn - sham atom in an electron gas of density @xmath11 .",
    "2 .   use the kohn - sham results to form pseudopotentials @xmath12 and scattering cross sections at the given density @xmath13 and temperature @xmath0 .",
    "3 .   use the @xmath12 to form pair potentials and pair - distribution functions . here the kohn - sham equation for the ion - subsystem can be approximated by some form of the hyper - netted - chain equation ( hnc ) with bridge terms .",
    "calculate the eos , ionization balance etc .",
    ", to obtain effective ionic charges @xmath14 , electron density @xmath15etc . , and self - consistently , repeating from item ( a ) . 5 .",
    "calculate the static resistivity and the static relaxation time @xmath10 using , e.g , using a ziman - type formula valid for strong coupling and finite @xmath0 .",
    "2 .   use the energy - level structure of the kohn - sham atom for the @xmath13 and @xmath0 regimes of interest to set up bound - bound , or bound - free processes which fall within the range of frequency @xmath2 considered .",
    "corrections may be necessary since the kohn - sham theory does not provide good excitation energies .",
    "3 .   construct the dynamic conductivity @xmath16 .",
    "this yields results equivalent to the fermi golden rule .",
    "extend the calculation of @xmath1 using time - dependent density - functional theory@xcite.include the coupling of electronic transitions to ion - dynamics .    while some aspects of this program can be carried out , it is fair to say that a complete , consistent theory of the transport properties of such many - body systems as posed by warm dense matter , or indeed , even the static properties as embodied in the equation of state _ for some regimes of density and temperature _ are open to debate , even for well studied systems like aluminum@xcite , and hydrogen@xcite .",
    "the objective of the present study is to calculate the dynamic conductivity of al and au plasmas for a number of compressions and densities where the drude theory may need correction due to the presence of shallow bound states .",
    "such boundstates ionize when the compression is changed , and produce distinctive changes in transport properties . sharply rising static resistivities under a change of compression",
    "is a common feature of some of the theoretical calculations shown here .",
    "however , the establishment of a genuine phase transition requires more care@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 of expanded liquid metals and plasmas show@xcite effects arising from clustering and excitonic effects , as the metal - insulator transition is approached .",
    "these excitonic effects are not important in dense systems .",
    "while al has been an object of extensive study , recent experiments in the warm dense matter regime have focused on gold targets@xcite . here",
    "we present numerical results for al and au for several compressions and temperatures .",
    "we use atomic units ( hartree=1 a.u .",
    ", the bohr radius @xmath17 = 1 , with @xmath18 ) .",
    "the atomic unit of resistivity , given by @xmath19 has a value of 21.74 @xmath20 cm . if the equilibriation of the electron distribution perturbed by the applied electric field is governed by a relaxation time @xmath9 , the conductivity @xmath21 is given as : @xmath22 a mean free path @xmath23 = @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is some characteristic mean velocity , is often introduced . if electrons were classical _ point _ particles , then it is evident that @xmath26 can not be smaller than the mean separation between collision centers .",
    "this is sometimes called the joffe - regel - mott rule , and holds well in many semiconductors",
    ". however , electrons are quantum particles ( wave packets ) with an extension of the order of the thermal de broglie length .",
    "further , @xmath9 depends on the electron momentum @xmath27 .",
    "thus there are examples where @xmath26 , obtained by some averaging process , is in fact smaller than some estimated `` mean - ion separation '' .",
    "although the concept of the mean free path is implicit in the boltzmann - equation approach , this is not necessary in the dyson equation which replaces the boltzmann equation in the quantum case . if the mean free path is large , the `` particle picture '' of the electron applies , while if this is comparable to the lattice parameter , then we are in the diffraction limit and the wave picture must be used .",
    "the dyson equation , valid at both extremes , describes the one - particle propagator which is closely related to the distribution function appearing in the boltzmann equation .",
    "the derivation of a transport coefficient from the dyson equation leads us to the current - current correlation function .",
    "this is closely related to various two - body distributions and collision kernels found even in classical kinetic models .",
    "unfortunately , although formal expressions can be written down , their evaluation using green s functions or related methods becomes impractical , especially if bound states are present .",
    "in effect , greens - function methods can be pushed to , say , second order in the screened interactions .",
    "such an approach is sufficient if there are no boundstates associated with the scattering potential .",
    "attempts to go further rapidly become intractable and useless .",
    "our approach is to use a variety of techniques and replace the ion - electron interactions by suitably constructed pseudopotentials , or use scattering cross sections calculated from phase shifts .",
    "this requires a fairly sophisticated non - perturbative description of the ion - ion and ion - electron correlations in the plasma .",
    "we begin with the bare nuclei and construct the electronic and ionic structure of the plasma .",
    "the interaction of the nucleus with the electron fluid is a highly nonlinear process and attempting to treat it using perturbation theory is unfruitful",
    ". hence we use the kohn - sham technique , and construct the non - linear charge density around the nucleus .",
    "the nucleus , together with its charge cloud of bound states and continuum - electron states constitute a neutral object .",
    "this neutral object is called the _",
    "neutral pseudo - atom _ ( npa ) , following the usage of e.g. , ziman and dagens@xcite .",
    "thus an important result of the kohn - sham procedure is the charge - density `` pileup '' , @xmath28 , around the nucleus that essentially screens the nucleus .",
    "a part of this arises from the free electrons and is denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "this @xmath28 and @xmath29 depend on the mean density @xmath30 of the electron fluid , temperature @xmath0 , and the nuclear charge @xmath31 .",
    "the kohn - sham procedure leading to the npa provides the phase shifts suffered by the continuum electrons when they scatter from the nuclei .",
    "these are used for constructing the scattering cross sections ( or pseudopotentials ) which describe the electron - ion interaction .",
    "the pseudopotential has an effective ionic charge @xmath14 and it behaves as @xmath32 for large @xmath33 .",
    "the rapid oscillations of the potential near the nucleus is replaced by a weak , smooth core region as the `` valence '' electrons do not really penetrate the ion - core .",
    "the pseudpotentials used in many of the solid - state or molecular code packages@xcite have the necessary transferability and could be quite useful .",
    "however , they assume that the pseudopotentials would be used within a schrodinger or kohn - sham type procedure rather than in a linear - response scheme , and hence they can not be directly used within a ziman - type formula .    sometimes , instead of using the all - electron kohn - sham equation or using a suitably constructed pseudopotential , the electron - ion interaction is replaced by a yukawa - type interaction ( effectively , a debye - screened interaction ) .",
    "the electronic structure is calculated for such a static - screened nucleus .",
    "this procedure is not justifiable since the energies of bound - state electrons correspond to very high frequencies at which there is no screening .",
    "further , the orthogonality of the continuum eigenstates and the bound states ensures that there is very little penetration of the free electrons into the bound - electron region .",
    "consequently , there is very little screening of the inner bound states , where as the yukawa potential screens the inner bound states as well .",
    "thus calculations using a debye - like potential in warm dense matter is likely to be incorrect irrespective of whether the born approximation , or a t - matrix , etc .",
    ", were used .    in the case of al and also",
    "au , it is possible to construct , in many situations , a soft pseudopotential @xmath34 which is weak in the sense that it is possible to recreate the non - linear electron - density `` pileup '' @xmath29 , obtained via the kohn - sham equation , by within _ linear _ response theory .",
    "that is , we define the @xmath34 such that @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the electron linear - response function . unlike the transferable pseuodpotentials used in it ab initio packages",
    ", this @xmath34 is specific to the chosen @xmath31 , @xmath37 , @xmath0 , and the atomic number @xmath31 .",
    "it is often convenient to write the pseudopotential in the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the bare coulomb potential and @xmath40 is a form factor .",
    "only a local pseudopotential is used , and this is quite adequate for an analysis of the experimental data currently available . since the pseudopotential is weak by construction , the ion - ion pair potential can be taken to be @xmath41 given @xmath42 , the ion - ion distribution function @xmath43 and the structure factor @xmath44 can be calculated using the hyper - netted - chain ( hnc ) equation or its extension where a bridge term is included .",
    "we note ( see below ) that the hnc equation ( or its extension ) is in fact the kohn - sham equation for classical particles ( here , al@xmath45 or au@xmath45 ions ) for certain choices of the ion - ion correlation potential ( there is no exchange potential because the ions are classical particles ) .    to summarize , by using the kohn - sham procedures , we have thus obtained the ion - electron pseudopotential @xmath34 , the structure factor @xmath46 , and the charge density @xmath47 , and an effective ionic charge @xmath14 which enters into the pseudopotential .",
    "the phase shifts have been used to construct a scattering cross section@xcite which may be used instead of the pseudopotential .",
    "hence we have a completely self - consistent procedure for obtaining all the relevant quantities starting from the nuclear charge of the element .",
    "the numerical codes for carrying out these procedures are available via the internet , to any interested researcher@xcite .      to answer this question , we consider the density - functional theory of a two component system consisting of electrons ( density profile @xmath28 ) , and ions , with a density profile @xmath48 , with respect to an ion positioned at the origin@xcite .",
    "then the hohenberg - kohn - mermin theorem states that the free energy @xmath49 $ ] is a functional of the density distributions such that : @xmath50/\\partial n(r)&=&0\\\\    \\partial f[n(r),\\rho(r)]/\\partial \\rho(r)&=&0 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first of these equations leads to an effective _ single - electron _ equation , viz . ,",
    "the kohn - sham equation where the effective potential contains an exchange - correlation potential which takes account of many - electron effects .",
    "the second equation also leads to a kohn - sham equation which is a classical equation for a _",
    "single ion_. this also contains an ion - ion correlation potential which brings in the effects of the multi - centered system .",
    "it can be seen that this classical kohn - sham equation reduces to the hnc equation for a certain choice of the ion - correlation potential .",
    "further , for `` simple '' metallic plasmas like al where the pseuopotential is weak , this scheme relates closely to pair - potential based liquid - metal theory .",
    "such a simplification does not hold , for e.g. , for hydrogen plasmas@xcite . since ion - ion , ion - electron and electron - electron correlations",
    "are included in the theory , it is _ not _ a single - ion model of the plasma .",
    "it is firmly rooted in a many - electron , many - ion dft approach which does _ not _ invoke the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "since the theory is explicitly based on distribution functions , it is manifestly non - local and can be easily implemented to be free of electron self - interaction errors .",
    "our approach may be contrasted with the car - parrinello ( cp ) approach where dft is used only for the electrons , while the ions are explicitly and individually treated by classical molecular dynamics .",
    "cp avoids the need for an ion - correlation potential , but demands a much larger computational effort .",
    "some of these efforts , based on md methods ( e.g , ref .",
    "@xcite ) have confirmed results obtained by the numerically simpler methods that we have used .",
    "the ziman formula is an application of the boltzmann equation to liquid metals .",
    "it was extended to finite temperatures by a number of authors.@xcite the crux of the problem is the evaluation of the collision rate . compared to some methods well known in plasma theory ( e.g , lenard - balescu ) the collision rate is easily evaluated using the `` fermi golden rule '' . in this section",
    "we briefly recapitulate ziman theory in the language of the fermi golden tule . in the relaxation - time approximation",
    "we assume that the perturbed fermi distribution @xmath51 for electrons with momentum @xmath52 relaxes towards the equilibrium distribution @xmath53 according to the equation : @xmath54 considering an electron scattered elastically from state @xmath52 to state @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , @xmath57 , the net scattering rate is the difference of the two processes @xmath58 .",
    "the initial and final densities of states for the @xmath59 process is @xmath51 and @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "hence the fermi golden rule gives @xmath61 since @xmath57 , this involves only an angular integration and @xmath56 .",
    "since the energy is not changed , the static resistivity arises _ purely from momentum randomization_. the change in momentum is @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 is the angle between @xmath55 and @xmath52 .",
    "this @xmath64 term does not appear in the usual relaxation time which is the time between scattering events .",
    "using these rates in eq .",
    "[ tau ] , we obtain a result for the _ inverse _ of the relaxation time . @xmath65 here the sum merely indicates the integration over @xmath63 .",
    "the `` @xmath0-matrix '' appearing here describes the scattering of an electron by the whole ion - distribution ( i.e , not just one ion ) .",
    "given a set of ions at instantaneous positions @xmath66 , then the interaction of an electron at @xmath67 with the whole distribution is of the form : @xmath68 the matrix element between the initial state @xmath52 and the final state @xmath55 , with @xmath69 = @xmath70 is : @xmath71 note that @xmath72 thus the ion - ion structure factor @xmath73 and the single - ion scattering cross section ( or the pseudopotential ) from a single ion combine to give the full scattering @xmath0-matrix .",
    "the dependence on the structure factor becomes negligible for @xmath74 ev .",
    "the individual scattering cross section can be replaced by a single - center @xmath0-matrix ( to be denoted by @xmath75 ) obtained from the phase shifts of the npa calculation for a single nucleus .",
    "the @xmath73 is also obtained from the pair - potential constructed from the same npa calculation . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed how to avoid the calculation of the @xmath73 by directly computing the scattering cross section from the _ whole ion distribution_. that is , @xmath76 s not factored into single - center @xmath75 and the associated structure factor .",
    "such an approach is needed for _ strongly interacting systems _ where such a factorization may not be valid . in this context",
    "we note that the resistivities calculated by us using the `` single - center '' model ( ie . , @xmath77 , and the full ion - distribution model ( @xmath76 for strong - scattering ) for h - plasmas were independently confirmed by the quantum monte carlo simulations of kwon et al@xcite . however ,",
    "if the pseudopotential is weak , the @xmath44 and the single - center @xmath78 may be used .",
    "given the inverse relaxation time @xmath79 for an electron of momentum @xmath27 , or equivalently , @xmath80 for the energy , @xmath81 , we need to average this over all electron energies to obtain a resistivity or a conductivity .",
    "the averaging used in the ziman formula leads to a _",
    "resistivity _ , while a direct application of the boltzmann equation would lead to a conductivity .",
    "thus , @xmath82    the boltzmann equation shows that the averaging relevant to the conductivity calculation is such that @xmath83 on the other hand , the averaging over the @xmath80 used in the extended ziman formula for the resistivity is somewhat different .",
    "@xmath84 here @xmath85 is a density - of states factor which is unity for free non - interacting electrons .",
    "it should be constructed from the phase shifts in a strongly scattering environment .    the initial assumption , eq .",
    "[ tau ] , was that the modified distribution was defined via a relaxation time .",
    "a more complete approach is to represent the modified part @xmath86 as a series expansion in a set of suitably constructed orthogonal polynomials , and obtain a variational solution .",
    "the set of polynomials appropriate for degenerate ( and partially degenerate ) electrons has been discussed by allen.@xcite . in the classical limit , such polynomials are the well known sonine polynomials .",
    "the usual relaxation - type approach is equivalent to a single - polynomial solution .",
    "this is adequate for dense al - plasmas , and for the range @xmath87 ev studied here .",
    "however , this is probably not so for al at 1/4 of the normal density , or for lower densities .",
    "we have less experience with au - plasmas to assess the quality of the resistivities for au obtaind here .",
    "the static resistivities for al calculated using the above methods ( and some extensions of it ) have been compared with experiment by benage et al.@xcite given the uncertainties in the experiment and the various approximations in the theory , the agreement is quite good .",
    "however , there are a number of difficulties in the calculation . if we consider an al - plasma at a compression @xmath88=0.25 , at @xmath89 ev the al - ion has the bound shells @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath91 level becomes increasingly shallow as the temperature is _",
    "reduced_. below approximately @xmath92 ev , the @xmath91 level begins to `` evaporate '' and becomes free , i.e , the @xmath91 bound electrons ionize . even at 2.5 ev ,",
    "the occupation of the @xmath91 level is @xmath7 0.744 .",
    "the ionization state @xmath14 increases from @xmath93 to 3 .",
    "the model where we have a single average @xmath14 is clearly not satisfactory in such a region .",
    "the plasma contains an equilibrium mixture of several ionization states @xmath94 with concentrations @xmath95 such that @xmath96 for such situations ( and indeed in general ) , the concentrations @xmath95 have to be determined from the minimum of the total free energy .",
    "if @xmath11 species of ions are possible , then @xmath11 different kohn - sham equations have to be solved , and @xmath97 ion - ion distribution functions have to be determined , and the total free energy has to be calculated as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath95 .",
    "the minimum property of the free energy yields the equilibrium plasma conditions from which the resistivity is calculated , using the @xmath11 scattering cross sections and the @xmath97 structure factors .",
    "we reported such a calculation for @xmath98 in ref .",
    "our experience is that , even with a multi - ion fluid model , the self - consistent equations may fail to converge since the @xmath91 level ( or the @xmath99 level ) affects the iterative procedure .",
    "majumdar and kohn have shown that physical properties of a system should be continuous across the region where an electronic state moves from being a bound state to a continuum state@xcite .",
    "hence we may calculate the resistivity in two adjacent regions separated by a non - convergent region , and smoothly join the calculated resistivity across the `` difficult '' region . in table",
    "[ k - s ] we show the kohn - sham eigenvalues of the bound - electron states for al ions in various plasmas .",
    "although the kohn - sham eigenvalues do not exactly correspond to the excitation energies , they provide an initial estimate which can be improved using the methods of time - dependent density functional theory , or using self - energy calculations@xcite .",

    "we return to this question in discussing the dynamic conductivity of al - plasma at @xmath88 = 0.25 , and 0.1 .",
    "table i shows that , for @xmath88 = 0.1 the resistivity essentially decreases with @xmath0 , while for @xmath88 = 0.25 the resistivity gradually increases in value , goes through a plateau - like region , and then begins to decrease with temperature .",
    "the same behaviour holds for the other higher compressions , but the table given here does not go high enough in temperature ( for the higher densities ) to show the plateau effect and the onset of the decrease of @xmath108 .",
    "some authors have interpretted the plateau in the resistivity as indicating a situation where the mean - free path has become as small as possible ( as in the joffe - regel rule ) .",
    "we _ disagree _ with this explanation of the existence of a resistivity plateau in these cases in terms of a saturation of the mean - free path .",
    "quantitative agreement is provided with a very _ different picture _ of what happens in the plasma .",

    "the chemical potential @xmath3 of the plasma electrons begins to decrease , and a temperature @xmath110 is reached when @xmath3 passes through zero and towards negative values . then the fermi sphere is gets broken down and from then on , _ all _ the electrons , and not just those near the fermi surface , begin to conduct . the plasma is essentially classical .",
    "the resistivity _ decreases _ as the temperature increases .",
    "we are in fact in the spitzer - like regime .",
    "the plateau defines the transition to the spitzer - like regime .",
    "the fermi energy of the @xmath88 = 0.1 case is small and it is already behaving like a classical plasma . in reality the picture is more complicated since the fermi surface changes not only because of the temperature , but also because the ionization of bound electrons changes the value of @xmath14 .",
