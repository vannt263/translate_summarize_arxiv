    "weak decays of heavy flavoured hadrons provide unique opportunities to probe the interplay of the electroweak theory and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the weak part of these decays involve short - distance transitions at the quark - level , whereas the hadron formation is governed by the long - distance , low - energy strong interactions .    due to the non - perturbative character of the strong interactions involved in heavy flavour decays ,",
    "the hadronization is not calculable from first principles . in the kaon sector",
    ", chiral perturbation methods are applicable , given the small value of the @xmath9 quark mass . in the opposite extreme ,",
    "the mass of the @xmath10 quark is heavy enough to allow for reliable calculations based on effective field theories .",
    "the charm quark is in between these two cases , which makes the computation of decay rates a challenging task .",

    "cp _ ) violation is phenomenon where manifestations of new physics are expected . in the standard model ( sm ) , _ cp _ violation processes are related to the complex phase in _ cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa _ matrix ( ckm )  @xcite , which describes the mixture between different generations of quarks .",
    "sm predicts very small _ cp _ violation effects in charm decays , in spite of large uncertainties .",
    "this makes charm decays a very interesting place to search for new sources of _ cp _ violation .",
    "new physics would introduce additional _",
    "cp_-violating phases , but disentangling these from the sm _ cp _ violation require the control of the overwhelming strong phases .",
    "we emphasize the advantages of the experimental investigation of the three - body charm meson decays .",
    "these decays are , in general , dominated by resonant intermediate states , with a small non - resonant component @xcite . with three - body decays one can search for local _ cp _ violation effects , but the description of the decay dynamics requires the understanding of hadronic effects such as the three - body final state interactions and the role of the s - wave component .    in this paper",
    "we address the issue of three - body final state interactions ( fsi ) in the decay @xmath11 , with emphasis on the s - wave component of the @xmath12 amplitude .",
    "this channel is chosen for several reasons : it is abundant , being studied by different experiments like e791 @xcite , focus @xcite and cleo @xcite ; it has a dominant s - wave component and a small non - resonant amplitude ; it allows the continuously study of the @xmath2 s - wave amplitude from threshold , at @xmath13  mev / c@xmath14 , up to @xmath15  gev / c@xmath14 , covering the whole elastic regime . with the @xmath11 decay one can fill the gap of the existing data on @xmath2 scattering from the lass experiment @xcite",

    "the resonant structure of three - body decays are determined by the analysis of the dalitz plot @xcite . in this two - dimensional diagram ,",
    "the probability density of a pseudo - scalar particle @xmath16 , decaying into three pseudoscalar particles ( @xmath17 ) , is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass of the parent particle .",
    "the phase - space density , @xmath20 , is constant , so the structures reveal the decay dynamics , forming the resonances , which are also affected by final state interactions .",
    "the goal of the dalitz plot analysis is to determine the matrix element @xmath21 .",
    "the dalitz plot analysis of the @xmath11 was performed by different experiments , such as mark iii @xcite , na14 @xcite , e691 @xcite , e687 @xcite , e791@xcite and focus @xcite , using different decay models .",
    "these decay models differ in the way the s - wave is described : the sum of breit - wigners plus a constant nonresonant term , refered to as the isobar model , the k - matrix formalism and a model independent partial wave analysis ( mipwa ) , to which we give special attention .",
    "the mipwa technique , developed by e791 @xcite , is intended to extract , in a independent way , the s - wave @xmath2 amplitude of the @xmath11 decay . in the mipwa , the s - wave @xmath2 amplitude is a generic function , @xmath22 , given by the fit of the dalitz plot .",
    "the p and d wave are determined according the isobar model .",
    "although the mipwa is the most model - independent approach , the extraction of the phase is an inclusive measurement , comprising different isospin amplitudes and fsi .    as a matter of fact",
    ", the comparison between the s - wave from scattering and from @xmath23 decays show important differences which need to be understood .",
    "in addition to an overall shift of approximately 150 degrees , the two amplitudes have different shapes .",
    "the s - wave @xmath2 amplitude depends on the isospin and orbital angular momentum of the system .",
    "there are two isospin states possible for this system , namely , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in the case of the lass experiment",
    ", it was shown that resonances and the corresponding scattering amplitude poles are present only in the isospin 1/2 channel , as verified in the analysis of the phase @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "it is expected that this phase would be common to all processes having a @xmath2 system , in the absence of rescattering involving other particles in the final state .",
    "this should be valid to all angular momentum states , according to the watson theorem @xcite .",
    "the s - wave phase - shift obtained from the @xmath27 decay with the mipwa ( focus and e791 ) differ from that obtained from @xmath2 scattering ( lass ) .",
    "there is an energy dependent discrepancy that can not be cured by any combination of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , up to an overall shift of @xmath30 , such an energy dependence was reproduced quite nicely below @xmath31 in a chiral three - body model of the @xmath32 decay with s - wave @xmath2 interaction , in the resonant isospin @xmath3 channel and computed up to two - loops  @xcite . we should mention that a previous attempt @xcite to describe the decay @xmath11 considering only two - body fsi ( no 3-body fsis and factorization of the weak vertex ) was also quite successful phenomenologically below @xmath31 .",
    "our aim is to further explore theoretically the three - body final state interaction in the @xmath11 decay .",
    "the motivation of our study is the possibility of three - body rescattering in @xmath11 decay for @xmath2 interactions in both isospin channels , while fitting the lass data in the whole kinematical region of the experiment up to @xmath33  gev .",
    "our study is based in a relativistic model for the three - body final state interaction in @xmath34 decay , starting with the three - meson bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .    in the model developed here",
    ", the decay amplitude is separated into a smooth term and a three - body fully interacting contribution , which is factorized in the standard two - meson resonant amplitude times a reduced complex amplitude for the bachelor meson , that carries the effect of the three - body rescattering mechanism .",
    "the off - shell bachelor reduced amplitude is a solution of an inhomogeneous faddeev type integral equation , that has as input the s - wave isospin @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath12 transition matrix .",
    "the theoretical contribution of the present work is to use in the three - body rescattering equations the s - wave two - body @xmath2 amplitude in both isospin states , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , fitted up to @xmath33  gev .",
    "we neglect the interaction between the identical charged pions .",
    "the three - body model of the decay amplitude is recasted in a bethe - salpeter like equation , which is conveniently rewritten in terms of a faddeev expansion .",
    "the contribution of the final state interaction in the three - body decay of a heavy - meson in our model of the s - wave @xmath2 transition amplitude is encoded by a bachelor amplitude associated with each faddeev component of the full decay amplitude .",
    "the bachelor function modulates the @xmath2 scattering amplitude in the final decay channel and in general carries a phase .",
    "the advantage of using the faddeev decomposition of the decay amplitude , is that ( i ) the integral equation for the bachelor function has a connected kernel , and ( ii ) the kernel is written in terms of the two - body scattering amplitude directly , instead of the potential .",
    "we use a parametrization of the @xmath2 scattering amplitude in @xmath24 and @xmath4 , which is input to the bachelor integral equations , and constitutes one source of the energy dependence seen in the @xmath11 s - wave phase shift , besides the phase of the @xmath2 amplitude .",
    "technically , we perform the light - front projection of the equations @xcite , to simplify the numerical computation of the observables by three - dimensional integrations . these techniques are well exemplified in the reviews of applications of light - front field theory to nuclear and hadron physics @xcite .",
