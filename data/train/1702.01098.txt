    "the research interests in these systems were invigorated after the discovery of spin - ice behavior in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the crystal field induced ising anisotropic ground state ( where the spins are forced to point along the local @xmath12 direction ) of these classical spin - ice materials along with ferromagnetic dipolar interactions give rise to a ` two - in / two - out ' configuration ( the so called ` ice rule ' ) of rare earth moments @xcite .",
    "the two - in / two - out spin configuration of these classical spin - ices is equivalent to the arrangement of protons in water ice , thereby they also possess low - temperature pauling residual entropy @xmath13 @xcite .",

    "while in a classical spin - ice system , because of strong magnetic anisotropy , only ising interactions exist , in a quantum spin - ice system the magnetic anisotropy is not so strong and significant non - ising terms exist in the hamiltonian , therefore quantum fluctuations strongly dominate the spin dynamics in qsi systems . in order to have strong quantum fluctuations",
