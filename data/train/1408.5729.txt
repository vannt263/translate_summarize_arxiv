    "understanding the dynamics of an evolving population structure has long been the goal of population genetics .",
    "several authors have constructed probabilistic models to study allele frequency distributions in populations subject to mutation , selection , and genetic drift @xcite .",
    "the mathematical analysis of these models leads to an improved understanding of the underlying system , and has been crucial for the interpretation of the laws of evolution .",
    "this is most evident in the quantitative analysis of cancer , which has seen numerous studies throughout the 20th century that addressed the kinetics of cancer initiation and progression @xcite . due to these and other studies ( see for a review ) , we now know that human cancer initiates when cells within a proliferating tissue accumulate a certain number and type of genetic and/or epigenetic alterations",
    ". these alterations can be point mutations , amplification and deletion of genomic material , structural changes such as translocations , loss or gain of dna methylation and histone modifications , and others @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of mutation acquisition is governed by evolutionary parameters such as the rate at which alterations arise , the selection effect that these alterations confer to cells , and the size of the population of cells that proliferate within a tissue .",
    "much effort has been devoted to model these processes mathematically and computationally , and to analyze the rates at which mutations arise within pre - cancerous tissues @xcite . in particular ,",
    "several investigators have studied the dynamics of two mutations arising sequentially in a population of a fixed finite number of cells .",
    "this scenario describes the inactivation of a tumor - suppressor gene ( tsg ) which directly regulates the growth and differentiation pathways of the cells @xcite .",
    "this may or may not lead directly to cancer .",
    "cells in which the tsg is inactivated can take a variety of fitness values .",
    "for instance embryonic retina cells with an inactivated rb1 gene can proliferate uncontrollably and create retinoblastomas @xcite . by definition",
    "these cells have a higher fitness than the wild - type cells . alternatively ,",
    "if chromosomal instability ( cin ) is taken into account , cells with deactivated tsg can have a lower fitness than the wildtype @xcite .",
    "empirical evidence for the exact fitness ( dis)advantage conferred to cells as a result of accumulating mutations is in general difficult to obtain , since _ in vitro _",
    "growth assays of non - transformed cells are challenging .",
    "for this reason and in order to provide general methods , the modeling literature has addressed a range of fitness values for single- and double - mutant cells ( e.g. ) .    subsequent modeling work on mutation acquisition @xcite has revealed a more detailed picture ; a homogeneous population harboring no mutations can move to a homogeneous state in which all cells carry two mutations without ever visiting a homogeneous state in which all cells harbor just one mutation .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as ` stochastic tunneling ' and represents an additional route to the homogeneous state with two mutations ; the sequential route is still available to the system , but it becomes less likely in certain parameter regimes . in this context",
    "the term ` tunneling ' refers only to overlapping transitions between the homogeneous states , it does not imply a statement about the structure of the underlying fitness landscape .",
    "the process we refer to as ` tunneling ' is not limited to valley - crossing scenarios .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a provides a schematic illustration of the tunneling process .    as with much of the existing literature on the stochastic tunneling",
    ", our work is not just limited to the case of cancer initiation .",
    "instead our results are related and applicable to more general scenarios in population genetics , including situations in which a heterogeneous population is maintained through mutation - selection balance , or the case of muller s ratchet when increasingly deleterious mutations become fixed @xcite .",
    "so far , most analytical investigations of stochastic tunneling @xcite have been limited to considering transitions between homogeneous ( or monomorphic ) states of the population , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a .",
    "these investigations were performed assuming that cells proliferate according to the moran process - a stochastic model of overlapping generations in which one cell division and one death event occur during each time step @xcite . analyzed the effect of the population size and mutation rates on the rate of appearance of a single cell with two mutations .",
    "these authors noted that for small , intermediate , and large populations , it takes two hits , one hit and zero hits , respectively , for a cell to accumulate two mutations . here",
    "a hit is defined as a rate - limiting step , such as the appearance of an alteration when mutation rates are small .",
    "considering fixation of cells with two mutations , , and obtained explicit expressions for the tunneling rate .",
    "subsequently , used the assumption of independent lineages ( i.e. , individual lineages of cells harboring one mutation were considered to behave independently from each other ) to compute the probability distribution for the time of emergence of a single second mutant in intermediate or large populations .",
    "used a similar branching - process approach to derive a further tunneling rate .",
    "other types of dynamics such as the wright - fisher process have been studied as well , see e.g. . in the wright - fisher process , cell generations",
    "are assumed to be non - overlapping , so that many birth and death events occur during each time step @xcite . using this process , determined the critical population sizes for sequential fixation or stochastic tunneling , and calculated the rate of tunneling as a function of the mutation rates , population size , and relative fitness of cells harboring one mutation .",
    "finally , these results were extended to investigate the effects of recombination , or sexual reproduction , on the rate of stochastic tunneling @xcite .",
    "these authors found that the time to establishment of the double - mutant cells can be reduced by several orders of magnitude when sexual reproduction is considered @xcite .",
    "recently , studied stochastic tunneling in a model which was not built upon the homogeneous - state approach .",
    "the author constructed a mutational network to study gene duplication .",
    "although the setting of the model is very different from the setting we consider here , the underlying principles are similar .",
    "the existing approaches for the moran model in an asexual population provide accurate analytical approximations for a subset of the parameter space .",
    "we present a systematic overview of the scope of existing quantitative work .",
    "there are extensive regions of parameter space which , up to date , have been left unexplored by analytical approaches .",
    "these are predominantly situations in which the double mutant is not the most advantageous in the sequence . before the double mutant reaches fixation , the population has to travel across a fitness hill or move constantly downhill in fitness space , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b .",
    "the dynamics can then become trapped in quasi - equilibria  a consequence of the mutation - selection balance @xcite . in these long - lived equilibria ,",
    "the population is heterogeneous , and so previous approaches are not justified . throughout our paper , these states are referred to as ` metastable ' .",
    "when these states exist , fixation is driven purely by demographic fluctuations .",
    "we address this regime based on ideas from mathematical statistical physics .",
    "specifically we employ the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) method to derive quantitative predictions for fixation times .",
    "examples of using the wkb method to describe the escape from metastable states include the computation of mixing times in evolutionary games @xcite , investigating extinction processes in coexisting bacteria @xcite or predator - prey systems @xcite , and investigating epidemic models @xcite . in the presence of recombination , have shown that metastable states can appear when recombination rates are large , even if the double mutant is advantageous .",
    "the authors note that the time to escape across this ` recombination barrier ' increases exponentially with system size , as explained based on a wkb approach .    in this paper , we first classified the generic types of behavior that can occur in a population of cells which acquire two subsequent mutations in a moran process : we determined when metastable states occur , when fixation is driven by intrinsic noise as opposed to deterministic flow , and where in parameter space fixation occurs in several subsequent hits .",
    "this classification was achieved by systematically studying the underlying deterministic dynamics of the process .",
    "we then obtained expressions for fixation times in parameter regimes which could not be captured by previous methods , i.e. regimes in which metastable states are found .",
    "we thus employed the wkb method to provide a more complete analytical description of the fixation dynamics in these parameter regimes .",
    "our work fills the gap left by the existing literature and leads to a more comprehensive understanding of mutation acquisition and stochastic tunneling in evolving populations .",
    "we considered a well - mixed , finite population of @xmath0 cells .",
    "each cell can be of one of three possible types , labeled type 0  a wild - type cell harboring no mutations , type 1  a cell harboring one mutation , and type 2  a cell harboring two mutations .",
    "initially , all cells are of type 0 . the evolution of the population is determined by a moran process @xcite . during each elementary time",
    "step of this process , a cell is randomly chosen to reproduce proportional to its fitness . in the same time",
    "step another cell is randomly removed , such that the total population size remains constant .",
    "the daughter cell can either inherit its type from the parent , or acquire a mutation during division .",
    "the relative fitness values of type-0 , type-1 and type-2 cells are denoted by @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . without loss of generality",
    ", we use @xmath4 throughout .",
    "the mutation rates @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the probability that the daughter of a type-0 cell is of type-1 , and the probability that the daughter of a type-1 cell is of type-2 , respectively .",
    "we neglect all other combinations of mutations .",
    "the assumption of no back - mutation is commonly used in the population genetics literature @xcite .",
    "it is justifiable since the human genome is very large , @xmath7 base pairs , and the probability of mutating a specific base per cell division very small , @xmath8 to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "therefore the chance of undoing a specific point mutation is vanishingly small .",
    "the probability that a second critical alteration occurs at a different locus is much higher .    in our model",
    ", finite populations will eventually reach a state in which all cells have acquired two mutations .",
    "this state is ` absorbing ' , i.e. once this state has been reached , no further dynamics can occur .",
    "there are of course physical processes beyond the second mutation . in pre - cancerous tissues for example , there will be a finite probability that cells progress from this state to accumulate further changes ( see discussion ) .",
    "these processes are not the focus of our work though , and so are not included in the model .     and @xmath10",

    "simulations are carried out using a standard gillespie algorithm @xcite , and times are measured in cellular generations .",
    "this process is described exactly by a master equation @xcite , which governs the behavior of the probability , @xmath27 , that the population is in state @xmath28 at time @xmath29 , and is given by @xmath30 .",

    "in particular , the detailed statistics of the population at any time can be derived from it , and it captures effects driven by intrinsic noise , such as extinction and fixation . obtaining a full solution of the master equation",
    "is difficult or impossible though in all but the simplest of cases . as a starting point",

    ", the distribution @xmath27 is sharply peaked around its average , and so the dynamics reduces to a set of equations for this mean .",

    "the aim of the following analysis is to calculate the rate at which the population will escape this state and enter the absorbing state in which all cells harbor two mutations . to proceed with the analysis we make the following simplifying assumptions , which are justified by the previous deterministic analysis :    1 .",

    "we assume that the population will ` leak ' into the absorbing state on a very long timescale from this distribution .",

    "iii , fixation is a one - hit process ",
    "the population only has to escape the stable fixed point  and not a two - hit process as in region ii where the effects of the two steps are compounded .",
    "contrary to the results for region i , the mean fixation time is a decreasing function of @xmath2 in region iii .",
    "this can be explained as follows : by increasing @xmath2 , the selection strength away from the 12 boundary decreases and the stable state moves to higher type-1 numbers , such that the population has an improved chance of reaching the 12 boundary . from there selection",
    "is directed towards the absorbing state , and the time spent on the 12 boundary is negligible compared to the time to reach this edge .",

    "note that there are systematic deviations between theory and simulation results in the data set shown as open triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , and to a lesser extent also for the data shown as open diamonds .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the fitness parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are very similar to each other or equal for these instances , and they are also close to the fitness of the wild - type .",
    "selection is then close neutral and the metastable state is only weakly attracting .",
    "the wkb approach then reaches its limits as the assumption of a long - lived metastable state begins to break down .",
    "in this paper we investigated the fixation of two successive mutations in a finite population of individuals proliferating according to the moran process .",
    "we discussed this in the context of the somatic evolution of a compartment of cells .",
    "the accumulation of two mutations can correspond to the inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene or alteration of genes causing chromosomal instability ( cin ) @xcite . if the cell carrying two mutations is deleterious , as can be the case with recessive cin genes @xcite , it will generally have low concentrations within the tissue",
    ". then the chance of a cancerous phenotype emerging ( further mutation ) is very low .",
    "demographic fluctuations can drive the double mutant to higher numbers , but these states are short - lived . if the double - mutant reaches fixation , the state is maintained until a further mutation occurs and hence the chance of a cancerous phenotype emerging is much greater .",
    "we first analyzed the deterministic limit of the evolutionary dynamics .",
    "we identified parameter regimes in which mutation and selection balance .",
    "these are regimes in which the double mutant is not the most advantageous in the sequence . in finite populations",
    ", this mutation - selection balance gives rise to long - lived metastable states .",
    "our analysis identified the escape from these metastable states as the key bottleneck to fixation of cells with two mutations .",
    "for parameter values for which there is no mutation - selection balance ( i.e. type-2 cells have the highest fitness ) , the fixation dynamics is largely governed by the deterministic flow .",
    "the rate - limiting steps are then the appearance of successful mutant lineages @xcite , and the subsequent fixation of cells with two mutations is a zero - hit process .",
    "as such the progression from healthy tissue ( all wild type ) to susceptible tissue ( all type 2 ; inactivated tsg ) will be fast relative to the cases in which a mutation - selection balance exists . if there is one stable fixed point in the deterministic dynamics , the process becomes a one - hit phenomenon limited by the escape from the corresponding metastable state . in regions with two fixed points",
    "one observes a two - hit process .",
    "the population becomes trapped in a first metastable state , escapes to a second metastable state , and then reaches full fixation .",
    "in addition to this qualitative classification , we calculated fixation times in parameter regimes previously inaccessible to existing analytical approaches .",
    "these are precisely the regions of parameter space in which mutation - selection balance exists .",
    "we used the wkb - method to calculate the mean escape time from the corresponding metastable states to the absorbing all - type-2 state .",
    "this escape time is identified as the fixation time of type-2 cells .",
    "we tested the analytical expressions and numerical results obtained from the wkb approach against individual - based simulations of the population dynamics .",
    "our theoretical predictions in principle rely on a limit of large but finite populations , and so they can be expected to be valid only for large enough populations .",
    "the comparison against simulations demonstrates the accuracy of our theory even at moderate population sizes of @xmath123 cells . for populations much smaller than this",
    "the assumptions of the wkb method break down .",
    "the rate - limiting step is then the occurrence of a successful lineage of mutants and not the escape from metastable states .",
    "the expressions obtained from the wkb approach become more accurate as the population size increases .    this analysis allowed us to classify how changes to the fitness landscape , mutation rates , and population size affect the probability of tunneling and the time - to - fixation of cells harboring two mutations . in terms of the development of tumors ,",
    "our analysis shows that the path to accumulating mutations is not simply limited by the mutation rates , but also by escape from metastable states .",
    "populations can exist in a heterogeneous state for very long periods of time before fluctuations eventually drive the second mutation to fixation .",
    "the probability with which stochastic tunneling occurs is , in part , determined by the location of these metastable states .",
    "if they are located close to the all - type-1 state , then the probability of tunneling is low .",
    "this occurs when cells with one mutation have a higher fitness than those with two mutations ( regions i and ii ) .",
    "the probability of tunneling decreases as the fitness gap between these two types of cell increases or as mutation rates decrease .",
    "the mean fixation time increases exponentially as the fitness gap increases .",
    "cells with one and two mutations are present in the tissue compartment for long periods of time ; their numbers are maintained by the mutation - selection balance .",
    "cell types are lost sequentially .",
    "wild - type cells can be driven to extinction by selection ( region i ) or by demographic fluctuations ( region ii ) .",
    "the extinction of type-1 cells is driven exclusively by fluctuations .",
    "when type-2 cells have a higher fitness than type-1 cells , and when both are less fit than the wild - type ( region iii ) , selection is always against cells of type-1 .",
    "mutation - selection balance maintains a low concentration of type-1 cells in the tissue , and hence the probability of tunneling is high . in this regime",
    "the mean fixation time is a decreasing function of the fitness of type-1 cells . as for all escape problems from metastable states ,",
    "the fixation time scales exponentially with the size of the population .",
    "fixation is noise - driven , and as the population size is increased the noise strength decreases , and hence fixation takes longer .",
    "although our theory is aimed at large population sizes and exponentially growing fixation times , we have shown that it can also make accurate predictions on biologically relevant timescales .",
    "assuming a cell generation lasts for one day , our theory can capture fixation times of around 3 years or more ( @xmath139 generations ) .",
    "related studies on the progression of cancer suggest a typical timescale on the order of @xmath140 years to accumulate a sufficient number of mutations @xcite , which is well within the scope of our theory . however , the times predicted by our theory are extremely sensitive to parameter variation .",
    "this limits the parameter ranges for which biologically relevant timescales can be generated .",
    "specifically selective ( dis)advantages need to be small ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with selection coefficients in related studies @xcite .",
    "of course the length of a cellular generation can vary by an order of magnitude or so , depending on the specific cell type @xcite .",
    "our results do , however , allow an extrapolation to situations when fixation times become very long , for instance for very large populations and/or when selection is strongly against the invading mutants .",
    "in these scenarios , stochastic simulations can become too expensive computationally to provide meaningful measurements .",
    "analytical methods based on backward master equations or backward fokker - planck equations suffer from computational limitations as well in such cases .",
    "our mathematical work complements existing analytical approaches to the moran model of cells acquiring two successive mutations .",
    "previous work has provided an appropriate machinery with which to compute the time - to - fixation of the second mutation in situations without metastable states .",
    "the present paper specifically addresses cases in which fixation is limited by the escape from long - lived states .",
    "this contribution closes a gap in the analytical characterization of fixation in this model and a more complete picture is now available .",
    "we have added a new method to the toolbox used to study stochastic tunneling .",
    "our deterministic analysis provides a systematic procedure to determine which tool to use for a given set of parameters .",
    "this accomplishment removes the need for stochastic simulations altogether , or at the very least it limits the circumstances under which they are needed .",
    "the present work has clear limitations in that it focuses on the moran model with only two successive mutations .",
    "we have not considered any processes beyond the second mutation , however such cases can exist in physical systems .",
    "if the type-2 cells are not cancerous , one would be interested in , for example , calculating when a metastatic cell ( three mutations ) first arises . in general this",
    "does not require the fixation of type-2 cells , and is related to the total number of type-2 cells over time . if metastable states are present , the cumulative number of type-2 cells prior to fixation is small , as described above .",
    "while we do not analyze this further , the typical number of type-2 cells at any time can in principle be computed from the quasi - stationary distribution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : quasistationaryapprox ] ) .",
    "our systematic approach , along with the combined theoretical apparatus of previous work and the wkb method are readily transferable to more complex models of cancer initiation and progression .",

    "if a cell can accumulate @xmath142 possible mutations , metastable states are found provided @xmath143 .",
    "a similar analysis can then be carried out . if the fitness landscape is arranged such that @xmath144 , the problem is analogous to muller s ratchet @xcite , which describes the accumulation of successive maladaptive mutations .",

    "they have shown that allowing multiple paths to accumulate the mutations reduces the fixation time .",
