    "there are several proposals to formulate quantum mechanics@xcite by generalizing the complex number field .",
    "the most obvious generalization is done by introducing quaternions@xcite , but there are other possibilities , like clifford algebras @xcite and @xmath0adic numbers @xcite . even inside each proposal , there may be internal divisions . in this article , we study a quaternionic quantum mechanics endowed with a quaternionic scalar product@xcite .",
    "our interest in the quaternionic formulation of dirac equation is motivated by the recent interesting results obtained in the standard dirac theory for the diffusion@xcite , tunneling@xcite and klein zones@xcite .",
    "the generalization to quaternionic potentials@xcite could be useful to understand many hidden aspects of the dirac solutions .",
    "even simple solutions , as those involving the potential step , contain interesting results . in the case of quaternionic quantum mechanics , there are fewer studies which investigate the quaternionic formulation of dirac equation . in adler s book @xcite , the theoretical foundations have been laid down , nevertheless explicit physical examples are still quite rare . more recently ,",
    "the dirac solutions in the presence of quaternionic potentials have been detailed discussed in ref . @xcite . in the potential region ,",
    "the quaternionic solutions allow two values for the wave - function momentum .",
    "this represents the first important difference with respect to the complex case in which only one value is found .",
    "a better understanding of the additional quaternionic solution can be achieved by studying an explicit example of quaternionic potential and calculating the reflection and transmission coefficients . in order to do this ,",
    "we recall the general solution presented in a previous article@xcite and study the scattering by a quaternionic potential step . in the complex scattering , for one - dimensional motion",
    ", we have not spin flip in the reflected and transmitted beams@xcite .",
    "thus , the spin flip is not considered too for the quaternionic case .",
    "the additional quaternionic solutions and the new reflection and transmission coefficients satisfy conservation of probability and in the complex limit reproduce the standard dirac scattering .",
    "a novel and intriguing behavior is observed for the scattering by a purely quaternionic step . in this case",
    ", there is no reflection and the wave - function shows an oscillating spatial pattern similar to the one observed for circularly polarized light .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section ii , for the convenience of the reader we fix our notation and recall the dirac solution in the presence of a quaternionic potential . in section iii , we obtain the reflection and transmission coefficients and calculate the probability current . in section iv , we discuss the effect of the quaternionic potential on the particle velocities .",
    "the last sections round off the article with a brief discussion on the total transmission for pure quaternionic potentials ( section v ) , final considerations and future possible investigations ( section vi ) .",
    "as usual in quaternionic quantum mechanics@xcite , the dirac equation is written in terms of an anti - hermitian hamiltonian operator . in this spirit , we introduce the anti - hermitian quaternionic potential step @xmath1 where @xmath2 are real constants . in the potential region ( region",

    "in the tunneling zone@xcite the wave function becomes evanescent and thus we have not particle or anti - particle propagation .    in order to explicitly determine the quaternionic wave functions",

    "consequently @xmath74 and eq.([contc ] ) implies a reflection rate @xmath75 .",
    "finally , for @xmath76 , we have @xmath69 and @xmath77 , we find a reflection rate @xmath78 suggesting pair production@xcite .",
    "in fig.1 , we plot the reflection rates for different value of quaternionic potentials as a function of @xmath79 . in the klein zone , the reflection rate increases by increasing the quaternionic potential . in this energy zone",
    ", the quaternionic perturbation thus contributes to the phenomenon of pair production .",
    "this is confirmed by the transmission rates in fig.2 .",
    "it is important to observe that for complex tunneling only evanescent waves , @xmath80 $ ] , appears in the potential region and this is seen by observing ( fig.1a ) that the reflection rate is 1 .",
    "the presence of a quaternionic potential breaks total reflection and this is explained by the fact that together evanescent wave , @xmath81 $ ] , also oscillatory waves , @xmath82 $ ] , are present in the potential region .",
    "the numerical calculation for the combined reflection and transmission coefficients is shown in fig.3 and confirms the continuity equation ( [ flux ] ) . from fig.3",
    ", we also observe a shift in the starting point of the diffusion zone and more important we have a decreasing energy zone for the evanescent waves by increasing the quaternionic potential .",
    "the last observation clearly suggest that oscillatory waves kill evanescent waves in presence of great quaternionic potentials .",
    "finally , we also find that the reflection and transmission rates @xmath83 and @xmath84 are very small compared to the reflection rates @xmath85 and @xmath86 , thus as a first approximation we can use these last coefficient rates to study quaternionic perturbations of complex quantum scattering problems .",
    "the incoming complex plane wave has the standard oscillatory exponential , @xmath87 $ ] , and consequently its group velocity is given by @xmath88 the transmitted quaternionic plane waves contain , in the diffusion and klein zones , the oscillatory exponentials @xmath89\\,\\,,\\ ] ] which determine the following group velocities @xmath90 recalling that @xmath91 we immediately obtain @xmath92\\,\\mbox{d}e\\,\\,,\\ ] ] and consequently @xmath93 the additional quaternionic spinor is then characterized by a velocity @xmath94 which is a typical velocity of diffusion , see fig.4a .",
    "indeed , we have not tunneling or klein zones as happens for the velocity @xmath95 , see fig.4b . by increasing the quaternionic part of the potential we see decreasing the velocity of the additional quaternionic spinor and by increasing the incoming energy",
    "we obtain an increasing value of the velocity .",
    "these are typical effects of diffusion .",
    "as observed before , the velocity @xmath95 presents three different energy zones ( see fig.4b ) , the diffusion zone for @xmath96 where the potential acts decelerating the particles , the klein zone for @xmath97 where the negative velocities solutions generates a flux from the right to the left which gives a reflection rates greater than one and consequently interpreted in terms of pair production and finally the intermediate tunneling zone where we have not propagation due to the presence of evanescent solutions .",
    "it is interesting to observe that in the diffusion zone , we have two propagation regimes and consequently two different velocities . these different velocities permit to decouple the two quaternionic solutions . in the pure quaternionic limit ( @xmath98 ) , as we shall discuss in our conclusions ,",
    "these velocities tend to the same value and this value is @xmath99 the free propagation velocity .",
    "our analysis shows a surprising effect for pure quaternionic potentials , @xmath100 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath101 and the continuity equation leads to the following system for the reflection and transmission coefficients , @xmath102 the solutions are immediately obtained by showing total transmission , @xmath103 the transmitted wave - function for the pure quaternionic potential is then given by @xmath104\\,e^{ipz}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\left[\\ , \\begin{array}{rr } \\cos(|w_0|z ) & \\,\\,\\,-k\\ , e^{i\\phi}\\ , \\sin(|w_0|z)\\\\ -k\\ , e^{i\\phi}\\,\\sin(|w_0|z)&\\cos(|w_0|z ) \\end{array}\\,\\right]\\,\\,\\underbrace{\\left(\\begin{array}{c } 1\\\\a\\\\ \\end{array}\\right)\\,e^{ipz}}_{\\psi_{_{c,{\\rm inc}}}}\\,\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and propagates with group velocity @xmath99 .",
    "due to the fact that the transmitted quaternionic spinor satisfies @xmath105 and moves with the same velocity of the free incoming particle _ seems _ impossible to see the presence of pure quaternionic potentials .",
    "nevertheless the problem of an apparent invisible presence of pure quaternionic potential can be solved by taking the mean value of operators .",
    "for example , the @xmath11 component spin mean value for the complex wave function @xmath106 is given by @xmath107 which in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath108 , reproduces the well - known result @xmath109 . in the presence of a pure quaternionic potential",

    "in this article we have studied the scattering of a dirac particle by a quaternionic potential step .",
    "our analysis shows the presence of an additional quaternionic solution characterized by a group diffusion velocity @xmath94 . the quaternionic solution which generalizes the standard one",
    "is characterized by a group velocity @xmath95 and presents three energy zones , diffusion - tunneling - klein zones . for diffusion the two solution",
    "are , in general , different and could be decouple the two solution in the potential region showing the presence of a quaternionic potential . by increasing the quaternionic part of the potantial we increase the klein zone and decrease the tunneling zone , see fig.4b .",
    "the most interesting effect is seen for a pure quaternionic potential where total transmission and a @xmath11 dependence on the spin operators appear .",
    "this suggests a possible investigation in quaternionic optics@xcite .",
