    "in this paper we survey a number of topics in the deformation theory of periodic bar - and - joint frameworks by investigating diamond frameworks , that is , generalizations to arbitrary dimension @xmath0 of the ideal atom - and - bond structure of diamond crystals .    our setting is purely geometric and does not involve any physical assumptions or properties .",
    "a general deformation theory of periodic frameworks was introduced in @xcite and further developed in @xcite .",
    "although crystallography , solid state physics and materials science have studied crystal structures for a long time , abstract mathematical formulations are of relatively recent date @xcite . of course , there are historical roots in problems related to sphere packings @xcite , lattice theory @xcite and crystallographic groups @xcite .",
    "diamantine frameworks have elementary geometrical descriptions in any dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the standard planar case @xmath1 is the familiar _ hexagonal honeycomb _ illustrated in figure  [ fig2diamond ] .",
    "another configuration , the so - called _ reentrant honeycomb _ illustrated in figure  [ figauxetic2d ] , was recognized in materials science as a structure with negative poisson s ratio @xcite and has become an emblem of auxetic behaviour @xcite .",
    "it will be seen below that auxetic deformation paths can be defined in strictly geometric terms @xcite and resemble causal - lines in special relativity .",
    "our treatment is mostly self - contained and may serve as an  introduction by example \" to several topics of general interest : topology of the deformation space , variation of volume per unit cell and critical configurations , possibilities for auxetic trajectories .",
    "the standard or canonical diamond framework in @xmath2 can be described by starting with a regular simplex @xmath3 centered at the origin @xmath4 .",
    "then , we take the midpoint @xmath5 of the segment @xmath6 and denote by @xmath7 the simplex obtained from the original one by central symmetry with center @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ fig3diamond ] shows this setting in dimension three . by using as _ periodicity lattice _ @xmath8 the rank @xmath0 lattice generated by the vectors @xmath9 , @xmath10 , we can produce a periodic set of vertices which includes the vertices @xmath11 and @xmath12 , by considering all translates of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for edges",
    "we take all segments @xmath15 , @xmath16 and their translates under @xmath8 . up to isometry and rescaling , the resulting framework is unique .    the abstract infinite graph together with the marked automorphism group represented by @xmath8 gives a @xmath0-periodic graph as defined in @xcite .",
    "there are two orbits of vertices and @xmath17 orbits of edges under this periodicity group . in other words ,",
    "the quotient multigraph consists of two vertices connected by @xmath17 edges .",
    "the same @xmath0-periodic graph allows other placements .",
    "one may start with an arbitrary simplex @xmath3 with the origin @xmath4 in the interior .",
    "then @xmath4 is connected with the vertices @xmath11 and provides @xmath17 edge representatives . by using the periodicity lattice @xmath8 generated as above by the edge vectors of the initial simplex ,",
    "one extends the finite system of vertices and edges to a full @xmath8-periodic system .",
    "the corresponding frameworks will be called _ diamantine frameworks _ , frameworks of diamond type or simply diamond frameworks .",
    "the three dimensional standard framework corresponds with the bonded structure of carbon atoms in ( ideal ) diamond crystals .",
    "the two dimensional version may be imagined as a graphene layer .",
    "what distinguishes the standard diamond framework among its diamantine relatives is its full symmetry group , which is maximal .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the corresponding theory of canonical placements of periodic graphs .",
    "related aspects can be found in @xcite .",
    "our present inquiry will assume that a diamantine framework in @xmath2 has been given and will be concerned with its _ deformations _ as a periodic bar - and - joint structure .",
    "deformations will have new placements for the vertices ( i.e. joints ) of the structure , but in such a way that all edges preserve their length ( i.e. behave like rigid bars ) and the deformed framework remains periodic with respect to the abstract periodicity group marked at the outset @xcite .",
    "it is important to retain the fact that the representation of this abstract periodicity group by a lattice of translations of rank @xmath0 is allowed to vary in deformations .",
    "let @xmath18 be the _ edge vectors _ emanating from the origin .",
    "their squared norm will be denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "the lattice of periods is generated by @xmath20 and with this ordering , the oriented volume of the fundamental parallelepiped ( unit cell ) is given by    @xmath21 = det \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } p_{i_1}-p_{i_0 } & ... & p_{i_d}-p_{i_0 } \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ]    the deformation space of a diamond framework defined by @xmath22 , with @xmath23 can be parametrized by the connected component of @xmath22 in    @xmath24    modulo the natural action of @xmath25 .",
    "as usual , @xmath26 denotes the @xmath27-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath28 .",
    "we investigate first the _ critical points _ of @xmath29 on the indicated product of spheres . at a critical point @xmath22",
    ", we must have    @xmath30    for some lagrange multipliers @xmath31 , @xmath16 . by inner product with @xmath32",
    ", we obtain :    @xmath33    and for @xmath34 this gives :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 means the absence of that column .    for @xmath37",
    "we find :    @xmath38    by summation or by euler s formula for the homogeneous function @xmath29 , we obtain :    @xmath39    equations ( [ distinct ] ) and ( [ same ] ) show that for non - zero critical values , all @xmath40 and then it follows that all inner products @xmath41 , @xmath34 must be equal .",
    "if we denote by @xmath42 their common value , we see from the gram determinant of the vectors @xmath43 that @xmath42 must be a root of the degree @xmath44 equation    @xmath45    for @xmath46 , the determinat on the left hand side of ( [ gram ] ) equals @xmath47 .",
    "if we assume distinct values @xmath48 and the natural ordering @xmath49 , we see that equation ( [ gram ] ) must have a root in every interval @xmath50 , since the determinant has opposite signs at the endpoints .",
    "thus , in the general case of distinct @xmath48 , equation ( [ gram ] ) has @xmath0 positive simple roots .",
    "the remaining root must be negative since the term of degree one in @xmath42 is zero i.e. the sum of all products of @xmath0 roots vanishes . by continuity",
    ", we still have _ a unique negative root _",
    "@xmath51 when some of the values @xmath48 become equal .    with respect to _ positive _ roots of ( [ gram ] ) ,",
    "we note that the inequality @xmath52 , implies that only the _ smallest among them _ @xmath53 may correspond to a cricical point .",
    "moreover , from @xmath23 , we infer that this root must be simple . indeed ,",
    "otherwise , with t@xmath54 , the root must be @xmath55 and this forces @xmath56 , resulting in @xmath57 .",
    "in fact , for the simple root @xmath53 one may confirm the more precise location @xmath58 by evaluating the determinant in ( [ gram ] ) at @xmath59 and finding it negative . with @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    ", we have    @xmath62    @xmath63    @xmath64    observing that , up to @xmath25 , a gram matrix detrmines two reflected vector configurations with corresponding volumes of opposite signs and equal absolute value , we may eatablish by induction on @xmath65 , that the negative root corresponds to the absolute maximum and minimum , while a simple smallest positive root corresponds to reflected critical configurations which are neither local minima nor local maxima . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the deformation space is a surface and a ` seddle point ' configuration is illustrated in figure  [ figsaddle ] .",
    "note that , in absolute value , a local variation of @xmath66 increases the area of triangle @xmath67 , while a local variatin of @xmath68 decreases the area .",
    "let us observe , for the latter part of the argument , when @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath34 , that in the hyperplane passing through @xmath71 we obtain a @xmath27-dimensional configuration with @xmath0 vectors @xmath72 , where    @xmath73    with @xmath74 in the indicated hyperplane .",
    "since @xmath75 , we find    @xmath76    which is a maximum or minimum configuration for @xmath77 .",
    "the absence of local minima or maxima other than the absolute ones shows that @xmath78 has exactly _ two connected components _ which are isomorphically exchanged by any orientation - reversing orthogonal transformation .",
    "let @xmath79 denote the squared lengths of a complete set of edge representatives for a @xmath0-dimensional diamond framework @xmath80 .",
    "the deformation space of this framework is a manifold of dimension @xmath81 and can be described as the quotient @xmath82 .",
    "the squared volume of a fundamental parallelepiped ( unit cell ) has a maximum corresponding to the unique negative root @xmath51 of ( [ gram ] ) .",
    "the indicated quotient space is a manifold because @xmath83 acts without fixed points on @xmath23 and local charts can be obtained as transversals to orbits .",
    "an alternative argument will follow from using gram coordinates .",
    "we have already implicated in our considerations the image of the parameter space @xmath84 obtained via gram matrices @xmath85 , with prescribed diagonal entries @xmath86 , @xmath16 .",
    "the image is the locus of all _ semipositive _ @xmath87 symmetric matrices of rank @xmath0 with positive diagonal minors .    while it is generally true that deformation spaces of periodic frameworks are connected components of _ semi - algebraic sets",
    "@xcite , the case of diamond frameworks allows very explicit treatment .",
    "we are going to describe another image of the deformation space , given by the gram marices of the generators @xmath88 , @xmath10 of the corresponding periodicity lattices .",
    "we denote by @xmath89 , the symmetric @xmath90 matrix with entries    @xmath91    from @xmath92 we retrieve all entries    @xmath93    and then    @xmath94    thus , @xmath95 and @xmath96 contain equivalent information and the _ affine transformation",
    "_ defined by ( [ retrieve0 ] ) and ( [ retrieve ] ) take the algebraic hypersurface @xmath97 to a degree @xmath44 hypersurface in the vector space of @xmath90 symmetric matrices ( with coordinates @xmath98 ) . line and column operations give the equivalent expression as a ` bordered determinant ' of @xmath96 , namely    @xmath99    the image of the deformation space consists of the intersection of this hypersurface with the open cone of _ positive definite _ symmetric matrices .",
    "* remark : *  strictly speaking , we should indicate by an index @xmath100 the fact that the diagonal entries in the gram matrix @xmath101 are fixed by @xmath19 .",
    "while all hypersurfaces @xmath102 in coordinates @xmath103 , @xmath104 are isomorphic to the case @xmath105 , @xmath16 under linear transformations of the form @xmath106 , what _ varies _ with @xmath107 is the intersection with the locus of semipositive definite matrices with positive diagonal minors ( or , in terms of coordinates @xmath108 in ( [ hypersurface ] ) , the intersection with the positive definite cone ) .",
    "let us show here that for all @xmath107 , @xmath109 , there are no singularities of @xmath102 in this intersection . with @xmath110 as coordinates , the vanishing of the gradient would make all off - diagonal minors equal to zero .",
    "since @xmath111 is not invertible , the diagonal minors must vanish as well and we obtain a contradiction .",
    "the argument shows in fact that the singularity locus of @xmath102 is made of symmetric matrices of rank _ strictly less _ than @xmath0 .    we shall investigate in more detail the case @xmath1 , which involves _ cayley nodal cubic surfaces_.",
    "for @xmath1 , the deformation space of a diamantine framework is a surface .",
    "the topology of this surface can be determined with relative ease by observing that in the quotient    @xmath112    the action of @xmath113 can be used to fix @xmath114 .",
    "thus , we may use as parameters the angles @xmath115 of @xmath66 and @xmath68 with @xmath114 and exclude from this torus , the degenerate locus corresponding to collinear vertices @xmath116 .",
    "when @xmath117 the torus is cut by two disjoint loops into two open cylinders ( isomorphic by reflection in the @xmath114 axis ) , the generic case is illustrated in figure  [ figgeneric ] .    for @xmath118 we cut along intersecting loops which leave two ( reflection isomorphic ) topological open discs in the complement .",
    "the case @xmath119 is the simplest , since we exclude @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , leaving two topological open discs in the complemeent .",
    "this gives :    the deformation space of a planar diamantine framework is an open cylinder when @xmath123 and an open disc when @xmath124 .",
    "* remark : *  the topological change from disc to cylinder is reflected in the apparition of the saddle point for the area function .    with these preparations",
    ", we may follow the scenario described in the previous section whereby the deformation space is mapped to the _ positive definite cone _ ( of symmetric @xmath125 matrices ) by associating to a framework the gram matrix @xmath126 of the two generators of the periodicity lattice @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "we illustrate the ` standard ' case @xmath129 which allows the most symmetric presentation , already depicted in figure  [ fig2diamond ] .",
    "equation ( [ hypersurface ] ) takes the form    @xmath130    @xmath131    the gradient vector    @xmath132    vanishes at the four points : @xmath133 . at this stage",
    ", one may recognize that our cubic ( [ wcayley ] ) is projectively equivalent with the _ cayley nodal cubic surface _ usually given in projective coordinates @xmath134 by the vanishing of the third symmetric polynomial    @xmath135    up to projective equivalence , , the cayley cubic is completely characterized by the fact that it has exactly four singularities which are all nodal points ( which may be seen as the vertices of a tetrahedron whose edge - supporting lines belong to the cubic ) .",
    "although equation ( [ standardcayley ] ) immediately reveals projective symmetry under the permutation group of the four coordinates @xmath136 , we shall retain the description ( [ wcayley ] ) in terms of @xmath96 , since we have to intersect our cubic with the _ positive definite cone _ defined by    @xmath137    the bounding cone @xmath138 intersects the cubic ( [ wcayley ] ) along the three double lines given by the edges through @xmath139 of the four nodes tetrahedron .",
    "moreover , @xmath140 is also the tangent cone at the singularity @xmath139 for ( [ wcayley ] ) .",
    "the notion of _ auxetic behaviour _ is formulated in the context of elasticity theory and is an expression of negative poisson s ratios @xcite .",
    "simply phrased , auxetic behaviour means becoming laterally wider when streched and thinner when compressed .",
    "our purely mathematical treatment of periodic framework deformations can not implicate physical properties per se and we shall rely on the geometrical alternative proposed in @xcite and illustrated in @xcite for periodic pseudo - triangulations .",
    "the auxetic property , from the greek word for growth , refers to certain one - parameter deformations of a periodic framework and not to the framework itself , which may allow , in general , non - auxetic deformations as well .",
    "we use the following definition which involves the positive semidefinite cone @xmath141 in the vector space of @xmath90 symmetric matrices i.e. the cone made of all symmetric matrices with non - negative eigenvalues .",
    "[ daux ] a smooth one - parameter deformation of a periodic framework in @xmath2 is called an auxetic path , or simply auxetic , when the corresponding curve of gram matrices @xmath142 for a set of independent generators of the periodicity lattice has all its tangent vectors @xmath143 in the positive semidefinite cone of @xmath90 symmetric matrices",
    ".    * remark .",
    "*  the similarity with the notion of causal - line in special relativity is apparent .",
    "a causal - line in a minkowski space is a smooth curve with all its tangents in the _ light cone_. for @xmath1 , the boundary of the positive semidefinite cone @xmath144 is given by the vanishing of a single ( lorenzian ) quadratic form and the two notions coincide . for @xmath145 ,",
    "the geometry of the cone @xmath141 is more complicated @xcite , but the analogy persists .      in order to identify the region of this surface made of points allowing some non - trivial auxetic trajectory through them , we must look for points where some non - zero tangent vector belongs to the positive semidefinite cone ( as a free vector ) .",
    "the boundary of this region consists therefore of points with tangent planes parallel to a tangent plane of the cone surface along a generating line .",
    "this locus can be detected algebraically as follows .",
    "the positive semidefinite cone is self - dual with respect to this norm @xcite , hence verifying that a tangent plane corresponts to a tangent plane of the cone @xmath140 along a generating line amounts to verifying that the normal direction with respect to ( [ trnorm ] ) satisfies the cone equation .",
    "the required normal is immediately obtained from the gradient formula ( [ gradient ] ) by halving the middle coordinate .",
    "thus , the equation for the region s boundary is the quartic        the curve of degree twelve resulting from the intersection of the cayley cubic and the above quartic can be first guessed and then proven to be made of the six lines supporting the edges of the tetrahedon of nodes , counted with multiplicity two .",
    "for instance , intersecting the quartic ( [ boundary ] ) with the plane @xmath150 gives the four lines resulting from the factorization      the first three factors correspond with the three edges of the tetrahedron of nodes on the face @xmath152 . by symmetry and the fact that auxetic trajectories can not exist in a neighborhood of the standard 2-diamond",
    ", we conclude that the region of the deformation surface consisting of points allowing a non - trivial auxetic deformation path is given by intersecting with the open half - space          geometrically , this means _ pointedness _ :",
    "the three ( edge ) vectors @xmath43 aree all on one side of some line through the origin .",
    "equivalently , one of the three sectors determined around the origin by the three vectors has an angle larger than @xmath156 as illustrated on the left configuration of figure  [ figtrio ] .",
    "* remarks . *  we have argued above for pointedness at the vertex of reference .",
    "diamantine frameworks are vertex transitive under full crystallographic symmetry , hence pointedness at all vertices follows .",
    "the reentrant honeycomb in figure  [ figauxetic2d ] is pointed at all vertices . for the relevance of pointedness in periodic pseudo - triangulations we refer to @xcite .",
