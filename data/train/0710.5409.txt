    "the recent progress in developing advanced radioactive beam facilities offers a great opportunity to explore in terrestrial laboratories properties of nuclear matter and/or nuclei with large isospin asymmetries . as a result ,",
    "studies on the role of the isospin degree of freedom have recently attracted much attention in both nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "the ultimate goal of such studies is to extract information on the isospin dependence of in - medium nuclear effective interactions as well as the equation of state ( eos ) of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the latter , especially the nuclear symmetry energy term , is important for understanding not only many aspects of nuclear physics , but also a number of important issues in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "information about the symmetry energy at zero temperature is important for determining ground state properties of exotic nuclei and properties of cold neutron stars at @xmath0-equilibrium , while the symmetry energy or symmetry free energy of hot neutron - rich matter is important for understanding the liquid - gas ( lg ) phase transition of asymmetric nuclear matter , the dynamical evolution of massive stars and the supernova explosion mechanisms .",
    "although the nuclear symmetry energy at normal nuclear matter density for cold asymmetric nuclear matter is known to be around @xmath1 mev from the empirical liquid - drop mass formula @xcite , its values at other densities , especially at supra - normal densities , are poorly known liba98,liba01b .",
    "predictions based on various many - body theories differ widely at both low and high densities @xcite .",
    "empirically , the incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter is essentially undetermined @xcite , even though the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter at its saturation density @xmath2 @xmath3 has been determined to be @xmath4 mev from nuclear giant monopole resonances ( gmr ) @xcite and the eos at densities of @xmath5 has also been constrained by measurements of collective flows in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "fortunately , heavy - ion reactions , especially those induced by radioactive beams , provide a unique means to investigate the isospin - dependent properties of asymmetric nuclear matter , particularly the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "indeed , significant progress has recently been made both experimentally and theoretically in extracting the information on the behaviors of nuclear symmetry energy at sub - saturation density from the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion collisions from the nscl / msu @xcite . using the isospin and momentum - dependent ibuu04 transport model with in - medium nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) cross sections ,",
    "the isospin diffusion data were found to be consistent with a density - dependent symmetry energy of @xmath6 with @xmath7 at subnormal density @xcite , which has led to the extraction of a value of @xmath8 mev for the slope parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density and a value of @xmath9 mev for the isospin - dependent part of the isobaric incompressibility of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the extracted symmetry energy further agrees with the symmetry energy @xmath10 recently obtained from the isoscaling analyses of isotope ratios in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions she07 , which gives @xmath11 mev and @xmath12 mev . the extracted value of @xmath9 mev from the isospin diffusion data is also consistent with the value @xmath13 mev obtained from recently measured isotopic dependence of the gmr in even - a sn isotopes @xcite .",
    "these empirically extracted values for @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the best and most stringent phenomenological constraints available so far on the nuclear symmetry energy in cold asymmetric nuclear matte at sub - normal densities .",
    "theoretically , a lot of efforts have been devoted to the study on the properties of cold asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "however , the properties of hot asymmetric nuclear matter , especially the temperature - dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , has received so far much less attentionche01b , zuo03,liba06c , xu07,xu07b , mou07 . for finite nuclei at temperatures below about @xmath16 mev ,",
    "the shell structure and pairing as well as vibrations of nuclear surfaces are important and the symmetry energy was predicted to increase slightly with the increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "interestingly , an increase by only about @xmath17 in the symmetry energy in the range of @xmath18 from @xmath19 to @xmath20 mev was found to affect appreciably the physics of stellar collapse , especially the neutralization processes @xcite . at higher temperatures ,",
    "one expects the symmetry energy to decrease as the pauli blocking becomes less important when the nucleon fermi surfaces become more diffused at increasingly higher temperatures che01b , zuo03,liba06c , xu07,xu07b , mou07 . on the other hand , due to the van der waals behavior of the nucleon - nucleon interaction ,",
    "it is expected that the so - called lg phase transition should occur in nuclear matter . since the early work ,",

    "@xcite , many investigations have been carried out to explore properties of the nuclear lg phase transition both experimentally and theoretically over the last three decades .",
    "for a recent review , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "most of these studies focused on investigating features of the lg phase transition in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "new features of the lg phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter are expected .",
    "in particular , in a two - component asymmetric nucleonic matter , there are two conserved charges of baryon number and the third component of isospin . the lg phase transition was suggested to be of second order@xcite .",
    "this suggestion together with the need to understand better the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter have stimulated a lot of work recently , see , e.g. , refs .",

    "while significant progress has been made recently , many interesting questions about properties of hot asymmetric nuclear matter remain open .",
    "some of these questions can be traced back to our poor understanding about the isovector nuclear interaction and the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite . with the recent progress on the constraints of the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy , it is therefore interesting to investigate how the constrained symmetry energy may allow us to better understand the thermal properties of asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "moreover , both the isovector ( i.e. , the nuclear symmetry potential ) and isoscalar parts of the single nucleon potential should be momentum dependent due to the non - locality of nucleon - nucleon interaction and the pauli exchange effects in many - fermion systems .",
    "however , effects of the momentum - dependent interactions on the thermal properties of asymmetric nuclear matter have received so far little theoretical attention @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we study systematically the effects of isospin and momentum dependent interactions on the thermal properties of asymmetric nuclear matter , including the isospin - dependent bulk and single - particle properties , mechanical and chemical instability , and lg phase transition , within a self - consistent thermal model using three different interactions .",
    "the first one is the isospin and momentum dependent mdi interaction constrained by the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the second one is a momentum - independent interaction ( mid ) which leads to a fully momentum independent single nucleon potential , and the third one is an isoscalar momentum - dependent interaction ( emdyi ) in which the isoscalar part of the single nucleon potential is momentum dependent but the isovector part of the single nucleon potential is momentum independent by construction .",
    "we note that the mdi interaction is realistic , while the mid and emdyi interactions are only used as references in order to explore effects of the isospin and momentum dependence of the nuclear interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we briefly introduce the mdi , mid and emdyi interactions and discuss some relevant thermodynamic quantities . results on thermal effects on the isospin - dependent bulk and single - particle properties of asymmetric nuclear matter , such as the nuclear symmetry energy , the nuclear symmetry potential and isospin - splitting of nucleon effective mass , are presented in section [ bulk ] .",
