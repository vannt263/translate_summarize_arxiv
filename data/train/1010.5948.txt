    "the inset of fig .",
    "7a illustrates a typical @xmath0as - nmr spectrum of the low - frequency satellite at 263 k. the spectra exhibit an asymmetric lineshape in the investigated temperature range .",
    "we analyzed the asymmetry of the satellite line shape at different temperatures by calculating its skewness ( see fig .",
    "7b ) , defined as the third standartized moment .",
    "with decreasing temperature the skewness exhibits an increase down to 225 k , where it starts to reduce again .",
    "the slope change in the temperature dependence of the frequency of the @xmath0as lower - satellite line as well as the maximum in the temperature evolution of the skewness may be related to the appearence of a electronic nematic phase below 225 k in eufe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath3 .",

    "in order to get more quantitative nmr results for a possible nematic phase , the angular dependence of the full @xmath0as nmr spectrum ( central line and both satellite lines ) was measured at 181 k. the dominant contribution to the magnetic shift stems from the eu@xmath4 4@xmath85 moments ( see above ) , and it is acceptable to assume that this contribution does not have a strong _ ab_-anisotropy .",
    "therefore , we reduced the parameter set to @xmath110 = @xmath111 = @xmath81 , @xmath112 , @xmath69 , and @xmath72 .",
    "analysis of the angular dependence of the full spectrum using the diagonalization of the hamiltonian [ eq .  ( 2 ) ] yields @xmath81 = -0.059(1 ) , @xmath82 = 0.069(2 ) , @xmath69 = 7.51(17 ) mhz , and @xmath72 = 0.04(3 ) .",
    "the change in @xmath69 compared to the value @xmath69 = 7.39(24 ) mhz obtained at 261 k in the tetragonal phase is small .",
    "the slight increase of @xmath72 may reflect the lower symmetry of the as site in a possible nematic phase . however , further experiments are needed to clarify the presence of a nematic phase in eufe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath3 .",

    ", the magnetic properties of eufe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath3 single crystal were investigated by x - ray diffraction , magnetization , and @xmath0as nmr experiments .",
    "it was found that the temperature dependence of the @xmath0as magnetic shift as well as the spin - spin relaxation rate follow a curie - weiss type behavior , implying that the @xmath0as nuclei interact with the localized eu 4@xmath85 moments in the eu layer .",
    "a large value of the hyperfine coupling constant between the @xmath0as nuclei and the eu 4@xmath85 moments suggests a strong coupling between the eu and fe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath3 layers .",
    "due to such a strong interlayer coupling the antiferromagnetic interaction between the localized eu@xmath4 4@xmath85 moments is probably mediated by a ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) type interaction .",
