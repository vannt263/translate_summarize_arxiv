    "let @xmath13 be a possibly twisted torus as defined above and let @xmath16,@xmath19 be two points for which the discs @xmath105 and @xmath106 are disjoint and the spheres @xmath15 and @xmath107 are circles . any orientable graph isomorphism between @xmath15 and @xmath107 produces an identification of points in @xmath108 . without identification ,",

    "+ actually , gauss - bonnet holds in great generally for arbitrary two - dimensional graphs with or without boundary .",

    "+ 2 ) the result appears in a different formulation , which does not make its gauss - bonnet nature evident : the princeton companion to mathematics @xcite mentions on page 832 the formula @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the number @xmath121-hedral faces and summation is over all faces .",
    "this is an equivalent formulation , but it makes the gauss - bonnet character less evident . + note that the combinatorial gauss - bonnet theorem is * entirely graph",
    "theoretical*. it avoids the pitfalls with the definition , what a polyhedron is @xcite .",

    "we can take a general finite graph which is two - dimensional at each point .",
    "its points are either boundary points , points where the unit sphere is one - dimensional but not closed , or an interior points , where the unit sphere is a circle , a simple closed graph without boundary .",
    "assume first that the graph @xmath4 has no boundary .",
    "for a two - dimensional graph , all faces necessarily are triangles .",
    "therefore , the number of faces @xmath93 and the number of edges @xmath94 are related by the * dimensionality formula * @xmath122 furthermore , we have the * edge formula * @xmath123 which is obtained by counting edges in a different way .    using the definition of the euler characteristic , and these two formulas , we compute @xmath124 this finishes the proof in the case of a graph without boundary .",
    "+ the case with boundary can be reduced to the boundary - less case : the boundary is a union of closed cycles . for each of these @xmath125 cycles",
    "@xmath126 just add an other point @xmath127 and add @xmath128 edge connections from each of the cycle boundary points of @xmath129 to @xmath127 .",
    "this produces a graph @xmath75 without boundary and which contains @xmath4 as a subgraph .",
    "the formula without boundary shows that @xmath130 is the sum of curvatures of the original interior points and the sum of the curvatures of the boundary points as well as the sum of the curvatures @xmath131 to each newly added point @xmath127 : @xmath132 we also have @xmath133 for boundary points , @xmath134 and @xmath135 so that @xmath136 . from the previous boundary",
    "less case , we get @xmath137 so that @xmath138    the just verified combinatorial gauss - bonnet is entirely * graph theoretical*. our curvature definition @xmath26 was motivated from the notion of * jacobi fields * in the classical case given by second derivatives . while `` smoothness '' requirements `` are necessary for the more sophisticated gauss - bonnet formula , the just mentioned metric gauss - bonnet holds for any polyhedron with triangular faces . for example , every finite triangularization of a two - dimensional compact manifold works .",
    "let us explain a bit more , why the curvature @xmath139 is ' ' differential geometric `` : the * gauss - jacobi equations * @xmath140 in differential geometry require the second differences of a jacobi field @xmath93 .",
    "our starting point had been to extend jacobi fields to the discrete for numerical purposes : for a discretized jacobi field with smallest space step @xmath20 , we have @xmath141 .",
    "the jacobi equations suggest to call this @xmath142 .",
    "since @xmath143 is the variation of the geodesic when changing the angle , we can integrate over the circle and we get the length @xmath144 of the circle of radius @xmath145 . therefore @xmath26 is a multiple of @xmath146 and there is no reason to normalize this in the discrete .",
    "+ the ' ' first order curvature \" @xmath147 on the other hand only requires first order differences .",
    "the curvature @xmath26 has some advantages over the curvature @xmath25 : +    * the curvature formula for the boundary and in the interior is the same , while for the curvature @xmath25 , one has to distinguish boundary and interior . +",
    "* there is no reference to a flat background structure for @xmath26 , while @xmath25 refers to the flat situation with via integers @xmath113 or @xmath148 .",
    "+ * it can be generalized to more general situations , where the distance in the graph can vary and where we have no natural flatness as a reference .",
    "we can look for example for distance functions which minimize the total curvature . + * it is more closely rooted to differential geometry of manifolds and classical notions like jacobi fields , a notion which is of `` second order '' too . +",
    "* it can be adapted to higher dimension , when defining scalar curvature for graphs and where no natural `` flat triangulated ambient reference graph '' exists .",
    "+    to summarize , we think that while @xmath25 is `` metric '' , @xmath26 has a more `` differential geometric '' flavor .",
    "similarly as many metric results extend to the differential geometric setup , things are more restricted also in the discrete , if higher order difference notions are used",
    ". the limitations of the results are related to similar limitations we know in the continuum .",
    "+ we can combine the two results : for the puiseux curvature with radius @xmath31 defined by @xmath149 we get the following corollary :        note that unlike the combinatorial curvature formula @xmath155 , the @xmath156 formula is only obvious modulo the main result for `` smooth domains '' proved here .",
