    "recreating quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , matter that existed in the first millisecond after the big bang , has been the goal of experiments at rhic and now at the lhc .",
    "qgp is created during the course of a collision of massive relativistic ions , such as gold ions in the brookhaven laboratory or lead ions at cern , and has been shown to exhibit the properties of a viscous liquid @xcite@xcite . to understand the properties of the matter created in these collisions , the evolution of matter during the collision itself must be understood .",
    "currently , we understand the basic stages of matter evolution , but lack the nuanced understanding of interdependencies and variation in parameters required for precise description of the collision .",
    "our present understanding of a heavy ion collision can be summarized as follows . after collision time",
    "@xmath3 fm / c , a strongly interacting liquid of quarks and gluons is formed , which is described with various accuracy by hydrodynamical models . as the gas cools , mesons and hadrons ",
    "freeze out \" and start interacting as colorless objects , until a phase of a relatively stable gas of hadrons is reached .    in this work we attempt to evaluate numerically the validity of models describing this picture by systematically varying model parameters and calculating @xmath2 distributions of proximity of fit to the experimental data .",
    "the evaluating algorithm used for these purposes is called chimera , which stands for comprehensive hydrodynamical integrated modelling evaluation and reporting algorithm , and will be described in detail in the next section .",
    "chimera is hydrodynamics - based framework , thus we first start by determining initial inputs and an initial energy distribution . in the analysis presented here ,",
    "the initial conditions are computed using monte carlo glauber model of the colliding nuclei @xcite ( e.g. , figure [ figure1 ] , panels @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) . however , chimera is capable of handling several initial condition implementations , including optical glauber initial conditions ( figure [ figure1 ] , panels @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , glauber conditions with fluctuations ( figure [ figure1 ] , panels @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , and colour glass condensate - inspired @xcite initial conditions ( not shown ) .",
    "we implement initial conditions with either the number of collisions ( n@xmath10 ) or number of participants ( n@xmath11 ) scaling . in the future",
    ", we plan to introduce a dial - up mechanism for this scaling , so that the initial conditions would scale with a predetermined mix of n@xmath10  and n@xmath11 , as is closer to experimental observations .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) used as a chimera input is obtained from lattice qcd calculations by the hotqcd collaboration @xcite , and agrees well with s95p - vi eos by huovinen and petreczky @xcite .",
    "this eos is much softer than the resonance gas eos predicted by the mit bag model @xcite , but is stiffer than the lattice - inspired eos used in vh2 hydro @xcite .",
    "all four equations of state are shown in figure [ figure2 ] .    as the last step before starting viscous hydrodynamics",
    ", we employ pre - equilibrium flow , i.e. , flow that originates from the non - equilibrated matter at early times ( approximately before @xmath12 fm / c ) , to start the evolution of the heavy ion collision .",
    "this is motivated by fits to variables describing the collective behaviour of the fireball , such as hanbury brown - twiss ( hbt ) radii and collective flow parameters .",
    "pre - equilibrium flow is universal when describing a boost - invariant system with a traceless stress - energy tensor @xcite .",
    "since our model utilizes a 2 + 1 dimensional hydrodynamic evolution ( see below ) , we are well - justified in employing pre - equilibrium flow in our description of heavy ion collisions .",
    "hydrodynamical initial conditions energy density distributions for au+au collisions at @xmath13 gev with @xmath144.4 fm , scaled as n@xmath11  ( @xmath15 ) , or n@xmath10  ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "panels @xmath6 and @xmath7 were produced using optical glauber geometry , panels @xmath4 and @xmath8 using monte carlo glauber , and panels @xmath8 and @xmath9 using glauber geometry with event - by - event fluctuations.,width=5 ]    using the set up described above , we run vh2 2d+1 viscous hydrodynamics developed by luzum and romatschke @xcite on the energy - density distribution that resulted from the above assumptions . at the end of the hydrodynamic evolution",
    ", we employ cooper - frye freezeout @xcite with viscous corrections , and then start the urqmd hadronic cascade @xcite to obtain final particle distributions .     equation of state functions from hotqcd ( solid green curve ) , s95p - v1 ( solid black curve ) , vh2 lattice - inspired eos ( pink curve ) , and the mit bag model eos with a first order transition.,width=4 ]    after ensuring that the resultant yields and mean @xmath17  ( @xmath18 ) of the produced particles match those of experimental data , we employ our analytical framework to draw numerical comparisons between our model results and those from experiment .",
    "this is done by describing our modelling data using chebyshev polynomials , and then calculating the @xmath2/ndf between these polynomials and experimental data .",
    "the @xmath2 is calculated taking into account point - to - point correlated , uncorrelated , and scaling uncertainties ( a , b , and c - type errors , as described in @xcite ) . performing this fit and calculation for a grid of initial state parameters , such as viscosity over entropy - density ( @xmath19 ) and the maximum temperature of the evolving medium ( t@xmath20 )",
    ", we are then able to do a global comparison of @xmath2 minima for a variety of soft observables : particle spectra , elliptic flow coefficients , and femtoscopic measurements .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , randomized glauber initial conditions for au+au collisions at @xmath13 gev with an impact parameter ( @xmath4 ) of 4.4 fm , shown in panels @xmath4 and @xmath5 of figure [ figure2 ] , are used as an input for this study .",
    "the main goal of the analysis is two - fold : first , to study the differences due to inclusion or omission of pre - equilibrium flow .",
    "second , to study the impact of using n@xmath10  vs. n@xmath11  scaling on the accuracy of describing experimental data .",
    "four sets of modelling data were generated : two sets with pre - equilibrium flow turned on ( one scaled with n@xmath10 , the other with n@xmath11 ) , and two sets with pre - equilibrium flow turned off ( also one with n@xmath10  scaling and the other with n@xmath11  scaling ) .",
    "we varied t@xmath20 ( highest temperature of the medium ) from 320 to 360 mev , and @xmath21s from 0.001 to 0.36 .",
    "the vh2 eos was replaced by hotqcd hisqfix eos @xcite .",
    "cooper - fry freeze - out was started when the temperature of the medium reached 165 mev ( t@xmath22 ) , roughly corresponding to the temperature of chemical freeze - out derived from the thermal model @xcite .",
    "urqmd was started at t@xmath23 mev .",

    "we calculate yields per unit of rapidity ( dn / dy ) and @xmath18  as a function of n@xmath11  for the three most common particle species : protons , kaons and pions , and compare these with experimental data , as shown in figure [ figure3 ] . since the modelled and experimental data are in a reasonable general agreement , we can now start mapping out the precise correspondence between the experiment and modelling data with variable initial conditions .    for each particle species , and for each of the three observables ( hbt radii , spectra , and the elliptic flow coefficient ) , we obtain a set of data produced with parameters described above .",
    "an example of particle spectra , plotted together with experimental data , is shown in figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "the figure illustrates a typical model - data comparison done to show the validity of hydrodynamical codes , and demonstrates a fraction of the available parameters generated by chimera .",

    "the @xmath2/ndf was mapped out for @xmath24 mesons , with experimental data obtained from both phenix @xcite@xcite and star @xcite@xcite collaborations .",
    "an example , shown in figure [ figure5 ] , shows a calculation of one map point for each @xmath2/ndf map ( spectra , flow , and each of the hbt radii ) .",

    ", these parameters represent the data fairly well , but exactly how well can be judged by the @xmath2/ndf shown in each panel of the figure .",
    "an example of @xmath2/ndf calculations for @xmath24 mesons .",
    "each panel shows a comparison between model and experiment for each of the available quantities : @xmath28 , spectra , and the three hbt radii ( right side of the figure ) .",

    "experimental data is shown in purple , and modelling data points  in salmon color filled circles.,width=6 ]",
    "the results of the study are summarized in table [ table1 ] and figure [ figure6 ] .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows the minima from @xmath2/ndf distributions for all measurements currently available within chimera made with @xmath24 mesons . the @xmath2/ndf minima range from 4.25 for @xmath2/ndf calculations of the combined hbt radii with n@xmath10  scaling and pre - equilibrium flow included , to 26.43 for the @xmath2/ndf distributions derived from calculations for v@xmath29 without pre - flow and with n@xmath11  scaling .",
    "trends , evident from the table , are as follows : @xmath2/ndf is significantly improved for v@xmath29 and hbt measurements by turning on pre - equilibrium flow and by using n@xmath10  scaling , while the reverse is true for pion spectra : the best @xmath2/ndf value is for n@xmath11  scaling in simulations with pre - equilibrium flow turned off .",

    "the distributions are drawn to display the most likely @xmath1/s and t@xmath20  values that would produce the experimental measurements .",
    "a global @xmath1/s and t@xmath20  value would be at the intersection of the @xmath2/ndf minima for all three experimental quantities modelled under the same set of conditions . however , this is not yet the case . in n@xmath10-scaled data , @xmath1/s and t@xmath20",
    "tend to higher values for spectra and to some extent for the hbt combined measurement as well , whereas for v@xmath29 the most likely @xmath1/s is much lower ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we also do not see a common minimum in the n@xmath11-scaled data : there the best @xmath1/s value for @xmath24 spectrum is 0.32 , 0.08 for v@xmath29 , and 0.0001 for hbt .",
    "the best t@xmath20  is the same for spectrum and hbt ( 320 mev ) , but higher for v@xmath29 .",
    "this indicates that the modelling part of chimera is not yet completely physical .",
    "in summary , we presented an outline and the first tests of an evaluative framework for comparing hydrodynamical modelling attempts of the quark gluon plasma to the experimental data available from the existing heavy ion experiments . vh2",
    "viscous hydrodynamical code was used as a base to generate modelling data used in this evaluation .",
    "the data comparison was done for 10 - 20% central @xmath13 gev au+au collisions at rhic , and aimed to study the effect of utilizing the initial scaling ( n@xmath10  vs n@xmath11 ) .",
    "in addition , we analysed possible effects of pre - equilibrium flow on the goodness of model s description of the data .",
    "the result of the comparison finds that n@xmath10  scaling might not be applicable when attempting to describe the spectra of the data derived from collision s bulk , but does a slightly better job than n@xmath11  scaling at describing flow and the hbt variables .",
    "we also found that pre - equilibrium flow significantly improves the goodness of fit for the hbt radii and v@xmath29 , as expected , but also undermined the model s description of spectra .    however , these are initial results , generated primarily as proof of principle . currently , we plan on implementing a more realistic initial - state energy - density distribution , vary the eos used for the analysis , and move on to three - dimensional hydro - dynamical modelling .",
    "we are also performing @xmath31 studies and studies to map out @xmath1/s dependence on temperature .",
    "in addition , we are expanding our framework to analyse other collision centralities in au+au , other collision species and collision energies .",
    "the onslaught of new data from rhic and the lhc provides us with a unique and exciting opportunity for a comprehensive and detailed study of the matter produced in these collisions .",
    "chimera is an important tool for the heavy ion community , and we hope it would be used accordingly .",
    "the author thanks scott pratt for his invaluable contributions and discussions , paul romatschke and matt luzum for making their hydrodynamic code available , and stephen bass for the availability of urqmd .",
    "most importantly , without ron soltz , irakli garishvili , jason newby , andrew glenn , michael cheng , and alex linden - levy there would not be chimera .",
