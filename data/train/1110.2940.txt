    "as the only stable hadron , the study of the structure of the proton provides a unique and excellent testing ground of qcd . in the one - photon exchange ( ope ) approximation , it is well - known that the proton s electric @xmath1 and magnetic @xmath2 form factors ( ffs ) can be extracted from the reduced differential cross section of the electron - proton @xmath3 elastic scattering as one has @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the momentum transfer squared , @xmath6 the laboratory scattering angle , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the mott cross section . for fixed @xmath9 , varying angle @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath10 , and adjusting incoming electron energy as needed to plot @xmath11 versus @xmath10 will give the ffs , a method often called the rosenbluth , or longitudinal - transverse ( lt ) , separation technique .",
    "experiments employing such a technique over the last half century all indicate that @xmath12 for @xmath13 gev@xmath14 as often quoted in textbooks .",
    "on the other hand , it has been shown @xcite that , again in the ope approximation , the ratio @xmath15 can be accessed in @xmath16 scattering with longitudinally polarized electron by measuring the polarizations of the recoiled proton parallel @xmath17 and perpendicular @xmath18 to the proton momentum in the scattering plane , @xmath19 polarization transfer ( pt ) experiment of this kind is only possible recently at jlab .",
    "it came as a big surprise that these pt experiments yield values of @xmath15 markedly different from 1 in the same range of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it prompts intensive efforts , both experimentally and theoretically , to understand this apparent discrepancy as the form factors , which describe the spatial distribution of the charge and magnetization inside the proton , are among the most fundamental observables in hadron physics .    on the experimental side ,",
    "the first step is to verify this discrepancy . a new global analysis of the world s",
    "cross section data was carried out @xcite .",
    "it found that the great majority cross sections were consistent and the disagreement with polarization transfer measurements remains .",
    "a set of extremely high precision measurements of @xmath15 was soon performed using a modified rosenbluth technique @xcite , with the detection of recoil proton to minimize the systematic uncertainties , and confirmed the discrepancy .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the immediate step taken was to carefully reexamine the radiative corrections which were known to be as large as @xmath20 of the uncorrected cross section in certain kinematics .",
    "of various radiative corrections , only proton - vertex and two - photon exchange ( tpe ) corrections contained @xmath10 dependence .",
    "the proton - vertex corrections had been investigated thoroughly by maximon and tjon and @xcite found to be negligible .",
    "realistic evaluations of the tpe corrections are hence called for to see whether they are able to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "both hadronic and partonic model calculations have found that tpe effects can account for more than half of the discrepancy which we will briefly review in sec .",
    "2 .    because tpe effects were found to play an important role in the parity - conserving electron - proton scattering , it was natural to speculate that @xmath0-exchange could also play a non - negligible role in the parity - violating @xmath21 elastic scattering which has been intensively studied in order to extract the proton strangeness form factors .",
    "theoretical efforts in this regard will be briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "3 . finally ,",
    "4 will be devoted to summary and discussions on the outlook of the future research on tbe effects , in particular the tpe effects in the parity - conserving electron - proton scattering .",
    "in this section , we discuss ( 1 ) the attempts to evaluate the tpe contributions to @xmath21 scattering , focusing mostly on two types of model calculations , one hadronic and the other partonic , ( 2 ) possible phenomenological parametrization of the tpe effect , and ( 3 ) use of @xmath22 ratio and normal asymmetries as constraints on models .       in the intermediate states . the cross - box diagram is implied .",

    "the partonic calculation of the tpe corrections was reported in @xcite .",

    "discussions about the experimental and theoretical status of beam normal asymmetries can be found in @xcite .",
    "strangeness content in the proton is one of the most intriguing questions in hadron structure study .",
    "indications on the contribution of strange quarks to the nucleon properties came from neutrino , electron deep inelastic scatterings and pion - nucleon sigma term .",
    "other observables were later suggested , including double polarizations in photo- and electroproduction of @xmath57 meson @xcite , and asymmetry @xmath58 in scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons from unpolarized protons .",
    "parity - violating asymmetry @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the cross section with a right - handed ( left - handed ) electron , arises from the interference of weak and electromagnetic amplitudes .",
    "weak neutral current elastic scattering is mediated by the @xmath61-exchange and measures form factors which are sensitive to a different linear combination of the three light quark distributions . when combined with proton and neutron electromagnetic form factors and with the use of charge symmetry , the strange electric and magnetic form factors , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ,",
    "can then be determined @xcite .",
    "specifically , within the one - boson exchange approximation , @xmath64 in @xmath65 is given as @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 with @xmath69 the fine structure constant , while @xmath70 and @xmath71 depend only on nucleon electromagnetic form factors , weinberg angle @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , which can be determined from other measurements .",
    "this is a clean technique to access the charge and magnetization distributions of the strange quark within nucleons and four experimental programs sample , happex , a4 , and g0 @xcite had been undertaken to measure this important quantity , which is small and ranges from 0.1 to 100 ppm .",
    "it is hence imperative to reduce theoretical uncertainty on the radiative corrections in order to arrive at a more reliable interpretation of experiments .",
    "leading order radiative corrections to @xmath58 , including the box diagrams in fig .",

    "we have briefly reviewed the advances made in the last decade to understand the discrepancy in the values of @xmath74 of the proton as extracted from the traditional rosenbluth separation of elastic cross sections and the new polarization transfer measurements .",
    "model calculations , both hadronic and partonic , strongly indicate that the two - photon exchange corrections can at least account for more the half of discrepancy observed",
    ". however , we are still not yet in the stage of quantifying the two - photon exchange effects as the theoretical models still suffered from uncertainties such as the on - shell approximation for the vertices in hadronic calculations and the extrapolations beyond the region of validity in partonic calculations .",
    "considerable challenge remains on the theoretical side to obtain a reliable estimate of two - photon exchange effects .",
    "just as in the case of nucleon - nucleon interaction , phenomenological parametrization of the two - photon exchange corrections could be useful .",
    "one of the attempts made in this direction is discussed to illustrate its potential usefulness .",
    "@xmath22 ratio is known to probe the real part of the tpe amplitude and can serve as a stringent test on tpe models .",
    "we show that indeed a recent measurement of @xmath22 ratio does rule out one of the proposed phenomenological parametrizations of the two - photon exchange corrections .",
    "more high precision experiments as planned in jlab , olympus , etc .",
    "will all be very helpful to further quantify the tpe effects .    at the end of the day ,",
    "the final goal of this game is to include tpe contributions in the analyses of experimental observables and subsequently extract the form factors which are the aims where we begin .",
    "such an analysis has been attempted in @xcite and more will definitely come .",
    "tpe corrections have been found or speculated to play an important role in many other observables like hyperfine splitting in hydrogen , pion form factors , @xmath75 and @xmath76 ratios in @xmath77 excitation , as well as in reactions like electron - nucleus scatterings , deep - inelastic scatterings etc .",
    "we refer the interested readers to the recent excellent reviews @xcite and @xcite for details .",
    "recent studies on the two - boson exchange corrections in the parity - violating elastic electron - proton scattering , where the proton strangeness form factors have been extracted , are also discussed .",
    "it is found that the modification incurred in going beyond the ms approximation is indeed significant for some data and the tbe corrections to @xmath58 depends strongly on @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "however , because the effects from nucleon and @xmath78 intermediate states tend to cancel out each other , the total effects are not large .",
    "it remains to be seen what role of other higher resonances might play .",
    "this will be a daunting task in hadronic model calculation since it will introduce many not well - determined coupling constants and cut - off parameters .",
    "recently , a dispersion calculation of @xmath79 corrections to @xmath80 has been attempted @xcite .",
    "many studies along this line have ensued @xcite",
