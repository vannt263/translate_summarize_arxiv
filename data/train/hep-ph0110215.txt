    "recently a great deal of new data have become available which help to determine the parton distributions of the proton .",
    "in particular we have new measurements of the structure functions by the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations at hera , and of the inclusive jet distribution by the d0 @xcite and cdf @xcite collaborations at the tevatron .",
    "these new data are both more precise and extend the kinematic range , and thus constrain the parton distributions , and the strong coupling @xmath0 , more tightly than ever before .",
    "zeus have also released a new measurement of the charm contribution to the structure function @xcite which , although it still has large errors , covers a wider kinematic range than previously .",
    "in addition , the ccfr collaboration @xcite have re - analysed their neutrino data in a model independent way and the discrepancy with the nmc data for @xmath7 has been largely resolved .",
    "also nutev data are becoming available @xcite , both for single and double muon production , and are improving the constraints from the neutrino sector .",
    "the e866 collaboration @xcite also have increased statistics for @xmath8 and @xmath9 drell - yan production and improve the determination of the difference between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 distributions . finally we note that as well as the usual data sets used in our previous fits , i.e. bcdms @xcite and slac @xcite proton data , nmc proton and deuterium data @xcite , e665 proton data and deuterium data @xcite , ccfr data on @xmath12 @xcite , e605 drell - yan data @xcite and cdf @xmath13-asymmetry data @xcite we have also included bcdms @xcite and slac deuterium data @xcite in order to obtain as precise a determination of the separate contributions of the up and down valence quarks at high @xmath1 as possible . we also include the most recent zeus svx data @xcite since it spans a slightly different range to that in @xcite .",
    "we no longer include prompt photon data due to theoretical problems and possible inconsistencies between data sets , and instead allow the high @xmath1 gluon to be determined by the vastly improved tevatron jet data .",
    "we note that both h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite have recently performed nlo dglap fits to their respective data , supplemented in the former case by bcdms data with @xmath14 , and in the latter case by bcdms , nmc , e665 and ccfr @xmath15 data .",
    "in particular , the h1 analysis determines @xmath0 and the gluon simultaneously . a value @xmath16 is obtained , with an additional uncertainty of about @xmath17 , mainly due to the uncertainty in the renormalization scale . a preliminary zeus analysis , reported at dis2001 , quoted @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "there is also an analysis including some of both the recent h1 and zeus data along with nmc , slac and bcdms data , and which allows higher twist contributions , which obtains @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we will find that the inclusion of additional data sets tend to increase these values somewhat .",
    "as an example of this we emphasize that the tevatron jet data are an important ingredient in pinning down the value of @xmath0 from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and related data , since they provide the dominant constraint on the gluon at large @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the inclusion of new jet data @xcite into the global analysis considerably improves the determination of the gluon .",
    "for example , we find an uncertainty of about 15% on the gluon distribution at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , but this is correlated with the value of @xmath22 .",
    "we perform a global nlo dglap analysis incorporating all the high - precision data mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the evolution begins at @xmath23 where there are three active quark flavours .",
    "we work in the @xmath24 renormalization scheme and use the thorne - roberts @xcite variable flavour number procedure to evolve through the charm and bottom thresholds .",
    "we note that we let all data sets in the fit carry equal weight .",
    "this is because we now feel that the full set of data is spread relatively evenly over the kinematic range of @xmath1 and @xmath25 , and also over the different partons , e.g. the tevatron jet data is now extensive enough to determine the high @xmath1 gluon accurately , and we no longer have to give existing data a high weight to tie down this particular region of parton space .",
    "in fact those data sets with very few points , e.g. the e866 drell - yan asymmetry measurements , probe partons ( in this case @xmath26 ) to which the rest of the data are rather insensitive , and the few points with unit weight are sufficient .",
    "we note that our best fit gives a @xmath27 per point of about 1 for all data sets ( except for the e605 drell - yan data , for the reason given in section 6 ) justifying the equal weighting .    as well as deciding on data sets and weights , we have to decide on a set of cuts in the usual variables @xmath25 , @xmath28 and @xmath1 . in order to investigate this we made a study of the sensitivity of the analysis to variation of these data cuts .",
    "we discovered that there was only marginal evidence for an improvement in quality if the @xmath25 cut was raised from @xmath29 to @xmath30 and no marked improvement above this .",
    "there was a marked improvement in quality if @xmath28 is raised from our previous cut of @xmath31 until we reach @xmath32 , which may easily be interpreted as due to the influence of higher twist and/or large @xmath33 terms in the perturbative expansion .",
    "hence , for the global fit presented below dis data with @xmath34 and @xmath35 are included , in order to exclude regions where higher twist and/or higher orders in @xmath0 are expected to play an important role .",
    "we also found that if a lower cut in @xmath1 was introduced there was continual improvement in the quality of the fit until @xmath1 reached a value of about 0.005 , suggesting that @xmath36 terms in the perturbative series may be important .",
    "the results and consequences of these cuts , particularly that in @xmath1 , will be dealt with in a future paper @xcite , but for the present analysis we take the conventional approach of not using any @xmath1 cut and investigate / suffer the consequences .",
    "the optimum global nlo fit is obtained with the starting parameterizations of the partons at @xmath23 given by @xmath37 the flavour structure of the light quark sea is taken to be @xmath38 with @xmath39 , as implied by the nutev data @xcite , and where @xmath40 the masses of the quarks are taken to be @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the former giving the best fit to the charm structure function data .",
    "the optimum fit corresponds to @xmath43 , i.e.  @xmath44 , in very good agreement with the world average.- and @xmath45-flavour couplings calculated in @xcite , and corrected in @xcite , up to nlo in @xmath0 . at this order",
    "the coupling is continuous across threshold but the derivative is discontinuous .",
    "more details may be found in section 3 of the first of @xcite .",
    "] we estimate the error in @xmath22 due to the errors on the data fitted in the global analysis to be about @xmath46 , as will be explained in detail later .",
    "the resulting partons are shown in fig . 1",
    ".    the improved hera data greatly increase the constraints on the gluon at small @xmath1 . the extra term in ( [ eq : a5 ] )",
    "is required to achieve an acceptable fit , and allows the starting gluon to become negative at small @xmath1 .",
    "a fixed @xmath47 behaviour is incorporated in this extra term so that only the small @xmath1 form of the gluon is affected .",
    "not including this additional term , which allows the input gluon to be negative at small @xmath1 , would lead to the input gluon being strongly valence - like and to a global increase in @xmath27 of about 100 .",
    "note that only half this increase comes from the data points at very low @xmath1 ( say @xmath48 ) , the rest coming from the hera and nmc points in the region @xmath49 , as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the gluon in the present analysis becomes positive for all @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and for @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "we note that while a negative gluon distribution may be slightly disturbing , there is no real reason for worry since the gluon distribution is not a real physical quantity , particularly in a somewhat unphysical factorization scheme such as @xmath54 .",
    "the implications for physical quantities will be discussed in the next section .",
    "recall that in the mrst99 analysis @xcite the uncertainties in the gluon were illustrated by presenting the optimal fit @xmath55 together with two fits @xmath56 and @xmath57 , with larger and smaller gluons at large @xmath1 , which represented the extremes of acceptable descriptions of the data .",
    "the present analysis , with greatly improved data , significantly reduces the uncertainty in the gluon distribution and yields an optimal solution with a large @xmath1 gluon nearer to @xmath56 than to @xmath55 . for this reason in fig .",
    "2 we compare the present partons with those of the @xmath56 set of mrst99 @xcite .",
    "we see that the major difference is in the gluon , or is a consequence of this changed gluon .",
    "first , we note the extended parameterization for the gluon , required by the new hera data , leads to a far smaller gluon at the lowest @xmath1 and @xmath25 . since the quarks are determined by evolution driven by the gluon in this range , they are also smaller than their mrst99 counterparts .",
    "the gluon is also smaller in the range @xmath58 than that for mrst99@xmath59  the jet data requiring less gluon in this range than the prompt photon data with no intrinsic @xmath60 included .",
    "both these reductions in the gluon allow for slightly more gluon in the range @xmath61 , giving an increased @xmath62 for @xmath1 a little below this .",
    "the shape of the charm ( and , to a lesser extent , the strange ) distribution simply follows the gluon since it is generated mainly by evolution from the gluon .",
    "finally we note that the down quark is slightly smaller at high @xmath1 than in mrst99 due to the effect of the extra deuterium data included in the present fit , and as a consequence it is slightly larger for values of @xmath1 in the region of @xmath63 .",
    "a good description of the hera data is obtained , as can be seen from figs .  3 - 6 .",
    "at the larger values of @xmath25 , i.e. we have corrected for our own values of @xmath64 rather than use those obtained by the fits by the experiments . ]",
    "compared to mrst99 , the curves for @xmath65 are flatter in @xmath25 for @xmath48 , but slightly steeper at higher @xmath1 .",
    "in fact for @xmath66 the data , particularly the high @xmath25 h1 and the nmc data , would prefer a higher @xmath67 , as can be seen in figs . 5 and 6 , where the low @xmath25 nmc data is consistently below the theory and the high @xmath25 h1 data is mostly above the theory . it appears as though the zeus data at high @xmath25 tend to lie below the h1 data , and are more consistent with the fit .",
    "however , we note that the preliminary zeus 98 - 99 data for @xmath68 @xcite seem to be more in line with the h1 data and prefer a steeper slope ( i.e. they lie consistently above mrst99 and hence would also be above mrst2001 ) .",
    "the systematic failure in this region of @xmath1 is a cause for concern regarding the validity of an nlo fit .",
    "in fact we note that the aforementioned improvement to the fit in this region , which comes from allowing the negative input gluon at small @xmath1 , is because this form allows there to be more gluon in the moderate @xmath1 region ( from the momentum sum rule ) , and hence a larger value of @xmath62 , as preferred by the data .",
    "we also note that although at the lowest @xmath1 and @xmath25 our gluon distribution is considerably negative , @xmath67 is quite clearly positive .",
    "this highlights the fact that the frequently quoted relationship @xmath69 is not even approximately true at small @xmath1 and @xmath25 when one works beyond leading order in perturbative qcd .",
    "qualitative arguments about evidence for saturation _ etc . _ which rely on this relationship should be treated with caution .",
    "the fits to hera data have been performed using the simplistic procedure of adding the systematic and statistical errors in quadrature .",
    "however , we have actually performed an analysis of the effects of the correlated errors . to be specific",
    "we have first performed fits to the data with only uncorrelated errors , then let the contributions of the correlated errors come into effect , and finally iterated .",
    "we find that the absolute value of the @xmath27 using this procedure increases for the zeus data , and stays more or less constant for the h1 data , but that somewhat surprisingly the position of the minima and incremental changes in @xmath27 when comparing different theoretical results stays much the same as when using the more simplistic addition in quadrature of all errors .",
    "hence , we decide to present the simpler procedure in determining the partons , and discuss details of the effects of correlated errors in an appendix since the results with full errors turn out to be an unnecessary complication . we do however let the zeus normalization go to its lower limit of @xmath70 in our fits in order to obtain the optimum description .",
    "the comparison with the charm data @xcite can be seen in fig .",
    "as one can see it is of a perfectly acceptable quality , and the errors on this data are still large .",
    "there is , however , a slight tendency to undershoot the data at the lowest values of @xmath1 and @xmath25 , and this may be a sign of the need to improve the theoretical treatment in this region . in this region of low @xmath1 and @xmath25 the prediction for the charm structure function is a little smaller than that for the mrst99 partons , which is entirely due to the smaller gluon we now find in this region",
    ". finally we note that the fit to the higher @xmath1 emc charm data @xcite is very similar to that for the default set in fig .",
    "27 of @xcite ( the high @xmath1 gluon is now a little larger , but @xmath71 is @xmath72 rather than @xmath73 ) , and hence is perfectly acceptable .",
    "the prediction for @xmath64 is shown in fig .",
    "8 , which also shows the prediction of the mrst99 partons .",
    "we see that the increased precision of the hera data and the increased flexibility of the gluon parameterization have led to a significant decrease in the prediction for @xmath64 at low @xmath1 and @xmath25 , replaced by a slight increase for @xmath74 .",
    "indeed , it now seems as though @xmath64 is taking a distinctly unphysical form for low @xmath1 and @xmath75 , and for part of this range is negative , and therefore certainly disallowed .",
    "data in a region where the predicted values of @xmath76 are negative , namely @xmath77 and @xmath78 . since",
    "only 6 points are affected , carrying practically no weight in the fit , we do not remove these points . ]",
    "this is a direct consequence of the negative nature of the gluon distribution at small @xmath1 and @xmath25 , and may be taken as another clear sign that the standard nlo fit is not working completely properly at small @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite since the different assumptions used in our fit lead to significantly different forms for the gluon and for @xmath22 , and hence different extrapolations into the high @xmath79 region .",
    "] as far as we are aware @xmath64 is the most direct probe of the gluon distribution at small @xmath1 and @xmath25 , and is the most appropriate quantity to examine in order to see the real pathological effects of the negative gluon distribution .",
    "@xmath80 is less sensitive since at low @xmath25 the kinematic constraint on charm production ( @xmath81 ) means one is probing the gluon at higher @xmath1 than for @xmath64 , and as seen in fig .",
    "7 , @xmath80 is perfectly well behaved down to @xmath82 .    at higher @xmath1",
    "the main change in our fit is due to the reanalysis of the ccfr data @xcite .",
    "their reanalysis no longer extracts @xmath83 by modeling both @xmath64 and @xmath84 , but now extracts either @xmath64 or @xmath84 ( there is a high degree of correlation between these ) and @xmath83 separately in a physics model independent manner .",
    "this has gone a long way towards resolving the apparent discrepancy between ccfr and nmc data on @xmath83 , where it had previously been impossible to simultaneously fit both for @xmath85 .",
    "the quality of the fit to the new ccfr @xmath83 data is shown in fig .",
    "overall the fit is very good .",
    "one might argue that there is still a systematic problem at the lowest @xmath25 , but this is far less pronounced than with previous analyses .",
    "there is also potentially a small error associated with the shadowing corrections ( details of which are found in @xcite ) which we do not account for .",
    "the reanalysis has also established the validity of the previous @xmath86 neutrino data .",
    "these data are essentially unaffected by the reanalysis , but we are now confident in using the data over the whole @xmath1 range , rather than just for @xmath87 .",
    "the fit is good over the whole range of @xmath1 . note that we normalize the complete set of ccfr data up by @xmath88 in order to obtain the best fit .",
    "other than this , the other new dis data ( at least new for our fit ) at high @xmath1 are simply the slac and bcdms deuterium data , which we have introduced for the first time .",
    "the fit to these data is shown in fig .",
    "it is of a perfectly acceptable quality , and one can see that , as with the proton data , the slac deuterium measurements prefer a rather steeper fall with @xmath25 than the bcdms data , and consequently a larger @xmath0 .",
    "the slac data are normalized up by @xmath89 and the bcdms down by @xmath90 .",
    "one of the major differences between the mrst2001 partons and our previous parton sets is the manner in which the high @xmath91 tevatron jets have been included . in the past",
    "@xcite we have simply checked that there is reasonable agreement with our predictions and the jet data .",
    "the difficulties in using the prompt photon data in order to determine the high @xmath1 gluon combined with the considerable improvement in tevatron jet data @xcite has led to a change in emphasis . besides the increase in precision , the d0 jet data are available in a range of rapidity intervals and so constrain the partons , and the gluon in particular , over a much wider @xmath1 range .",
    "we , therefore , now include the d0 and cdf jet data in the global fit on an equal footing with all other data sets .",
    "algorithm rather than the more usual cone algorithm @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the two methods is moderate , the major difference being at low @xmath91 .",
    "we use the original data since we feel these have been more extensively studied , and because they also cover a much wider range in pseudo - rapidity .",
    "] however , because in this case the correlated systematic errors are the dominant source of error , being much larger than the uncorrelated errors , it is imperative to deal with these in a correct manner .",
    "in fact we adopt the same method of fitting to the data as do the respective experimental collaborations when describing their own data .",
    "note , however , that rather than using some nlo prescription such as jetrad @xcite or eks @xcite to generate an nlo correction for each point , we derive a smooth nlo k - factor by fitting to a set of such points .",
    "since the nlo corrections generated from the above programs have some error and scatter , this means that our value of @xmath27 will not be identical to that obtained by the experiments themselves for the same parton set ( though it will be very close ) .",
    "in particular our values of @xmath27 for the cdf1b jet data are a little higher , while for the d0 jet data they are slightly lower .",
    "we find that for our best global fit we obtain a reasonable description of the combined jet data with a @xmath27 of 170 for 113 points .",
    "the quality of the fits is shown in figs .",
    "11 and 12  the error bars account for uncorrelated errors alone . in both cases it is clear that while at the low @xmath91 end the normalization is about correct , at higher @xmath91 ( and rapidity ) the theory lies below the data .",
    "an acceptable fit is then obtained by accounting for the correlated systematic errors .",
    "first , for the cdf1b fit the ( data@xmath92theory ) obtained is allowed to move by letting data move relative to theory by application of each of the sources of correlated error , i.e. the @xmath27 is obtained from @xmath93 with @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the theory prediction for data point @xmath96 , @xmath97 is the measurement with uncorrelated error @xmath98 , and @xmath99 is the one - sigma correlated systematic error for point @xmath96 from error source @xmath100 .",
    "hence , the data and theory move relative to each other at the cost of an increase in @xmath27 of @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the fraction of one - sigma which has been utilized for each error source . to 1 .",
    "this does not affect any results at all significantly . ] hence in fig .",
    "12 we see that the effect of introducing the error correlations @xmath103 has been to bring down the data at higher @xmath91 significantly in order to match the shape of the theory prediction .",
    "this large shift requires many of the @xmath102 to be of the order of 1 , and for them all to conspire to move the data in the same direction relative to the theory .    for the d0 jet data the fit",
    "is performed using the full error matrix , i.e. @xmath104^{-1}(e_j - t_j),\\ ] ] where @xmath105 are the covariance matrix elements defined by @xmath106 where @xmath100 runs over all sources of error , @xmath107 is the error of point @xmath96 and @xmath108 is the correlation between points @xmath96 and @xmath109 .",
    "this is actually a very similar way to obtain a @xmath27 to the previous method ( see appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "however , it accounts for the correlated systematic errors in a rather less transparent manner , though the good fit to the d0 jet data must clearly be obtained in much the same way .",
    "we illustrate the correlated errors in fig .",
    "11 simply by introducing a band with width given by adding each source of correlated error in quadrature .",
    "although this is not as explicit as in fig .",
    "12 , it indicates roughly how the data may move relative to the theory without a large cost in @xmath27 .    at the central value of @xmath22 of 0.119 ,",
    "this global fit ( including jet data ) allows a variation in @xmath110 of about @xmath111 for @xmath112 and @xmath113 , which corresponds to @xmath114 accuracy for @xmath112 and @xmath115 .",
    "this is a factor of 3 or so less than the mrst99 variation of the gluon ranging from the @xmath56 to the @xmath57 gluon , and hence we do not provide parton sets with gluon extremes . since the body of jet cross section data is ( very roughly ) @xmath116 , then @xmath117 for @xmath118 of order @xmath119 is roughly inversely proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "however , at high @xmath1 the gluon distribution decreases more rapidly with increasing @xmath25 , the larger the value of the coupling .",
    "this increase in speed of evolution with increasing @xmath0 more than compensates for the decrease in the high - scale gluon required by the jets with @xmath0 , and for low @xmath25 ( @xmath120 ) the high @xmath1 gluon increases as @xmath121 increases .",
    "we note , however , that these optimum global fits are not the best possible fits to the high @xmath91 jet data .",
    "the fit is only achieved by compensating for the smallness of the theory at high jet @xmath91 and @xmath122 ( both of which probe the highest @xmath1 ) using the correlated systematic errors .",
    "hence , the fit can be improved by an increase in the size of the high @xmath1 gluon . in principle",
    "it is possible to obtain a fit with a @xmath27 of about 120 for the 113 points ( see below ) rather than @xmath123 , the scatter of data points making this @xmath27 value about the lowest that is achievable . at the central @xmath22 value of",
    "0.119 it is possible to raise the high @xmath1 gluon sufficiently to improve the quality of the jet fit to @xmath124 , but only at the cost of @xmath125 for the rest of the data .",
    "this is mainly at the expense of the description of the moderate @xmath1 dis data , i.e. h1 , zeus and nmc data , since the increase of gluon at high @xmath1 is countered by a decrease at intermediate @xmath1 , and hence a decrease in @xmath62 . at lower @xmath0",
    "the price is even higher since the lower @xmath0 already impacts upon the behaviour of @xmath62",
    ".    however , as one goes to higher @xmath22 the situation changes . at @xmath126",
    "one can obtain a fit to the jet data with @xmath127 , and where this improvement is only marginally overcompensated by the deterioration in the rest of the fit compared to the best global fit .",
    "for this set of partons , denoted by mrst2001j or simply j , the fit to the jet data is shown in figs .",
    "13 and 14 . for the fit to the d0 data the shape is obviously",
    "greatly improved , both as a function of @xmath91 and of @xmath122 , demonstrating that the apparent excess @xmath27 in the description of the tevatron jet data is either a problem of parton distributions or of systematic errors , but is unlikely to be a sign of new physics .",
    "the normalization of the theory is a little high , but this is easily accounted for by the systematic error in normalization .",
    "the fit to the cdf1b data actually gives a slightly worse @xmath27 than before .",
    "but now the fit does not rely on a large shift of data due to systematic errors , and is perhaps more satisfactory in this sense .",
    "the problem with this j set of partons is the behaviour of the gluon .",
    "the input form at @xmath128 is @xmath129 which is shown in fig .",
    "15 , together with the behaviour at @xmath130 .",
    "we see that the input shape has a rather worrying `` kink '' which results in the distinct `` shoulder '' at @xmath21 . ) , the large power of @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath131 in this term , and the extra effect of the second term controlling the very small @xmath1 behaviour . this second term",
    "then effectively frees one parameter in the first term , which for previous parton sets represented the full parameterization of the input gluon , allowing more flexibility in the high @xmath1 form of the gluon . ]",
    "we do not deem this to be an acceptable gluon ( admittedly a subjective decision ) , and rule this fit out , although we do make the mrst2001j set of partons available .",
    "at @xmath132 we obtain a similar result , i.e. the best overall fit gives about @xmath124 for the jet data , but has a gluon with the same type of peculiarities ( though less severe ) .",
    "again we rule this fit out .",
    "hence , in our fits we impose the condition that @xmath133 does not change sign in the region of high @xmath1 which rules out the possibility of both kinks and shoulders in the high @xmath1 gluon distribution .",
    "imposing this condition results in a fit to the jet data within the global fit which is roughly independent of @xmath22 . with a gluon without peculiarities , but that this results in a fit to the rest of the data which is very poor .",
    "this problem is improved , though not completely rectified , when an @xmath1-cut is applied ( see @xcite ) . ]",
    "the fit to much of the rest of the data is very much along the lines discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the nutev data @xcite on single and double muon production do not qualitatively change the conclusions regarding the strange contribution to the sea already indicated by the ccfr dimuon data @xcite , i.e. that the strange distribution is acceptably obtained from half the average of the @xmath134 and @xmath135 distributions at @xmath23 .",
    "similarly the e866 collaboration @xcite have provided new data on the drell - yan asymmetry which is more accurate and extends the kinematic range slightly , but does not really change the relative @xmath136 behaviour of the partons . in particular , our simple parameterization of @xmath26 still suggests that @xmath137 for @xmath138 , but there is no evidence whether this is really true or not .",
    "the lepton rapidity asymmetry data from cdf @xcite ( related to the @xmath13 rapidity asymmetry ) also continue to give us important information on the @xmath139 ratio .",
    "finally the e605 drell - yan data @xcite still play an important role in pinning down the form of the sea quarks at high @xmath1 .",
    "however , they also play an important and unexpected role in influencing the fit to the jet data and determining @xmath22 .",
    "as we will see below , the quality of the description of these data deteriorates as @xmath22 increases .",
    "this is actually an indirect effect . as @xmath22 increases , the high @xmath1 gluon at lower @xmath25 increases so as to give the correct gluon normalization when evolved up to the scales appropriate for the description of the jet data .",
    "this larger high @xmath1 gluon ( and larger @xmath22 ) drives a positive evolution of the high @xmath1 sea quarks . as",
    "this effect becomes more significant it distorts the shape of the sea quark distribution in the range relevant for fitting drell - yan data , worsening the fit .",
    "therefore the e605 data prefer lower value of @xmath22 and a lower high @xmath1 gluon .",
    "indeed , for the mrst2001j type partons the fit to the drell - yan data deteriorates quite seriously compared to the best global fit .",
    "hence , these data have assumed a more important role in the context of the whole global fit than previously .",
    "the quality of the central fit for the major data sets is shown in table 1 below .",
    "for each of the smaller data sets , e.g. cdf @xmath13-asymmetry @xcite and e866 drell - yan asymmetry @xcite , the @xmath27 per degree of freedom is about 1 per point .",
    "for all the dis data sets the numbers are quoted for statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature .",
    "the quality of the fits to the individual data sets is satisfactory . for the e605 data the systematic errors are quoted in a slightly ambiguous manner , and are generally subdominant , and so we fit to statistical errors alone .",
    "hence , the quite large @xmath27 in this case .",
    "the treatment of the correlated systematic errors for the tevatron jet data has been discussed in section  4 .",
    ".quality of the fit for mrst2001 partons to different data sets .",
    "the first mrst column shows the @xmath27 values of the optimum fit with @xmath140 .",
    "also shown are the values for parton sets obtained from fits with @xmath141 and @xmath142 , as well as those for parton set j which has structure in the high @xmath1 gluon . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as a final point we note that the overall quality of the nlo - in-@xmath0 fit remains fairly good .",
    "the raised cut in @xmath28 , from @xmath31 to @xmath143 has removed some deficiencies in the high @xmath1 slope which may be due to higher twist or higher orders in @xmath144 .",
    "also , it is noticed that investigating cuts in @xmath25 implies little evidence for higher twist at general @xmath1 .",
    "however , some of the previous areas of concern have been increased rather than reduced .",
    "it is a worrying point that the minimum @xmath27 values for many individual data sets within the global fit ( fig .",
    "16 ) lie outside the range @xmath145 . also ,",
    "as in previous fits , there is also still a struggle to get a steep enough evolution of @xmath83 in the region @xmath146 as is seen in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "moreover , it is also difficult to obtain enough high @xmath1 gluon to get a very good fit to the jet data .",
    "these two points , coupled with the rather slow evolution of @xmath83 at the lowest @xmath1 , combine to produce a gluon which has gone from being valence - like to very negative at the input scale @xmath147 .",
    "while this is not necessarily a problem in itself , it has resulted in a prediction for @xmath64 that is worryingly small at very small @xmath1 ( fig . 8) .",
    "hence there are implications of problems at small @xmath1 .",
    "we have not really considered the effect of a lower @xmath1 cut in this paper , but will demonstrate in a future paper @xcite that investigating fits with low @xmath1 data cut out does have a serious effect on the partons and has strong implications on the real success of the standard nlo - in-@xmath0 fit at low @xmath1 .",
    "remember that in the same way that the high @xmath1 form of the gluon imposed by jet data influences small @xmath1 via the sum rule and convolutions , cutting out small @xmath1 data can influence the fit and partons at higher @xmath1 . however , the effect of varying the @xmath1 cut on the value of @xmath0 is minimal , since the major constraint comes from the evolution of the high @xmath1 partons .",
    "it is , therefore , not surprising that the value remains well within our quoted experimental error , @xmath148 . on a related point",
    "we have already noticed that extending the theory to ( an approximate ) nnlo - in-@xmath0 does lead to a general improvement in the quality of the fit , and to some significant changes in partons and predictions , particularly at small @xmath1 .",
    "we have not considered nnlo at all here , but will produce detailed results in a forthcoming paper @xcite .    in summary , in this paper we have used all deep inelastic and hadron collider data available in order to obtain the most accurate and precise determination of the nlo parton distributions currently in existence , and have also determined the value of the strong coupling constant @xmath22 with tight constraints .",
    "this enables us to probe the success of the conventional nlo perturbative qcd framework in describing hadronic collider physics , and we find that overall it is still working well .",
    "this then provides us with the necessary starting point for predicting and explaining new physics coming from present and future particle colliders .",

    "we have investigated the effects of fitting the hera data @xcite taking into account the systematic errors in a consistent fashion . in order to do this",
    "we have adopted the same procedure as for the cdf jet data , i.e. in order to obtain the @xmath27 we use ( [ eq : sys1 ] ) , which is also the procedure usually adopted by the h1 collaboration . as before we limit the size of each of the @xmath102 to be @xmath149 , though again this has little effect .",
    "let us discuss the fit to the zeus data first , since this is particularly simple .",
    "if we take our default fit and compare to the zeus data with uncorrelated errors only , we obtain a @xmath27 of 378 for the 242 points in @xcite .",
    "if we keep the theory fixed and let the @xmath102 for the sources of correlated errors vary then @xmath27 lowers to 331 .",
    "the way in which it does this is very simple  the majority of the data normalizes down to its minimum of @xmath70 , while that below @xmath150 takes its normalization down the further available @xmath88 .",
    "this seems to be essentially in order to bring the data into line with the h1 normalization ( which matches well with that of the nmc data ) .",
    "all further changes are a very minor perturbation to this .",
    "those error sources which could alter the shape , such as the positron energy scale and hadronic energy flow labeled type b , play no part , presumably because they would cause dramatic alterations in a few bins which would only lead to a deterioration of the fit .",
    "the effect for h1 data is a little more complicated .",
    "the default fit using uncorrelated errors alone gives a @xmath27 of 485 for the 400 points .",
    "if we let the @xmath102 for the sources of correlated errors vary , then @xmath27 lowers to 381 .",
    "this comes from 3 sources .",
    "some of the low @xmath1 and @xmath25 points move up @xmath151 , coming closer to the zeus data .",
    "some of the highest @xmath1 points use their large correlated errors to move up @xmath152 since they clearly fell below theory ( and the extrapolation of bcdms data ) .",
    "finally , the biggest improvement comes from the region @xmath153 , where the low @xmath25 points move up by up to @xmath154 , and the high @xmath25 points minimize their normalization to move down by @xmath155 .",
    "these effects combine to flatten the slope with @xmath25 at fixed @xmath1 and partially reconcile the data with the failure of the theory to have a large enough @xmath62 in this range of @xmath1 .",
    "thus the data shift from their central values to partially account for either the incompatibility between h1 and zeus data , or between data and theory . if the data are then moved from their central values to those imposed by the correlated systematic errors and the fit redone there is to all intents and purposes no change in either @xmath22 or the partons , i.e the iteration essentially converges at the first step . to be precise , the value of @xmath22 for the best fit moves by less than @xmath156 , the quark distributions change by less than @xmath157 at all @xmath1 and @xmath25 , and the gluon distribution changes by a maximum of @xmath158 at @xmath159 , lowering to @xmath88 at @xmath160 and @xmath157 at @xmath161 . in the precise region of @xmath1 where the gluon distribution becomes negative , but this is just due to the change in sign of the gluon here , and the absolute change is extremely small . ] hence , the correlated systematic errors simply allow the data to readjust themselves to best match the possible theory and other data sets , but rather surprisingly the parameters in the theory do not alter at all significantly to rematch the altered data .",
    "we summarize the major effects .",
    "first , the normalization change of the zeus measurements , and of low @xmath25 , low @xmath1 h1 measurements brings the data sets closer together , but does not change the best fit , which is a still a compromise between them .",
    "second , the raising of the high @xmath1 h1 data improves its description , but these data carry virtually no weight compared to nmc , bcdms and slac data .",
    "finally , the flattening of the intermediate @xmath1 data in @xmath25 again improves the fit quality , but @xmath62 is still too flat for these data even after the alteration , and also for nmc data , so the pull on the fit is only partly diminished .",
    "in fact we also notice that the increments in @xmath27 between different fits are very similar when the correlated systematic errors are used in full to when the simple addition in quadrature of statistical and systematic errors is used .",
    "this can be seen by examining the fits for @xmath162 to @xmath163 using the iterative procedure described above .",
    "we find that although the base points of the curves for hera data in the bottom right plot in fig .",
    "16 move ( significantly for zeus ) , the shape and scale of the curves is extremely similar to those shown  there is a very slight tendency for the low @xmath22 @xmath27 to be lower and the high @xmath164 @xmath27 to be higher , but only by a couple of units .",
    "the refit in the second stage of the iteration results in the @xmath27 for other data sets changing , but only by a couple of points each , and in such a way that the total change for non - hera data is only a couple of points in total .",
    "hence , the curve for the total @xmath27 in the top left of fig .",
    "16 is changed by at most 34 units at each @xmath22 , except for the common shift , and all conclusions on parton distributions for the best fit and uncertainty of @xmath22 are unaltered .",
    "we have also examined more significant changes in theory curves by comparing to a theoretical model designed to work better at small @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the fit to h1 data gives a better description of @xmath62 , with a @xmath27 of 420 , if uncorrelated errors alone are used .",
    "when correlated errors are allowed to contribute , no large correction is needed for intermediate @xmath1 so the improvement is of @xmath165 compared to @xmath166 above . in both cases",
    "the final @xmath27 values are within a 34 units of that obtained from the simplistic procedure . for zeus data",
    "the model gives a @xmath27 value 18 worse for quadrature , and 23 worse for the full treatment of errors , and in this case the increment when statistical errors alone are used is much the same .",
    "hence , the freedom of the data to move in the direction of preferred theory or other data when correlated systematic errors are properly accounted for lessens the pull on a fit compared to the use of uncorrelated errors alone , but for the present hera data this seems to have a rather similar effect to the lessening of the pull obtained by adding statistical and systematic errors in quadrature .",
    "the relative success of this approximation is presumably due to the fact that for the vast majority of the data points the uncorrelated error is easily dominant , and correlated shifts in the data are rather smaller than the uncorrelated errors of most points .",
    "this is in contrast to the tevatron jet data where , as we see in fig .",
    "12 , the correlated shift can be an order of magnitude greater than the uncorrelated error of some points .",
    "therefore , in our determination of the best fits , and the variations about these , we use the simple prescription for errors for the hera data , since it does not lead to unnecessary complications , and does not change any results to any significant degree , as quantified above ."
