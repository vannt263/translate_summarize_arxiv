    "the results for the integrated total cross sections , @xmath126 , @xcite including the initial state radiation and coulomb corrections , indicate that the off - shell contributions amount to a small relative correction lower than @xmath127 .",
    "alternatively , one may consider , after reconstructing the neutrino momentum from the missing energy , a procedure to impose suitable cuts on the @xmath128 invariant mass , aimed at suppressing the non resonant production background .",

    "if one performs a single @xmath136 quark tagging , the rates for the corresponding events , @xmath137 , are reduced by a branching fraction , @xmath138 , but this is compensated by the probability of misidentifying a light quark jet as a @xmath20 quark jet , which lies at the small value of @xmath139 with the current silicon vertex techniques . if no @xmath20 quark tagging is performed at all , then the above large rates may make it necessary to resort to an analysis of isolation cuts of the type to be discussed in the next subsection .      in order to separate the signal from background , we consider the same set of characteristic final state kinematical variables as proposed in the study by han and hewett .",

    "the distributions in these @xmath144 variables for the signal and background , at a center of mass energy , @xmath145 , are plotted in fig.[figtopp ] .",
    "these numerical results were obtained by means of the pythia @xcite event generator .",
    "one notices marked differences between signal and background .",
    "the maximum jet energy distribution is uniformly distributed for the background but sharply peaked for the signal , where the peak position is determined by the top mass and the incident energy as , @xmath146 .",
    "the minimum jet energy is uniformly distributed for both signal and background , but happily the corresponding intervals are very partially overlapping .",
    "the signal events rapidity distributions for the maximum energy jet are more central for signal than background .",
    "a similar trend holds for the lepton rapidity distributions .",
    "the dijet invariant mass is a most significant variable in discriminating against the background due to its pronounced peak at the @xmath147 mass . for the signal",
    ", the dijet invariant mass is uniformly spread out .",
    "although we do not show here the distributions for the top mass reconstruction , this also features a strong contrast between a strongly peaked signal and a uniform background .",
    "the lepton energy distributions for the signal and background are peaked at the opposite low and high energy ends of the physical interval , respectively .",
    "this is a familiar effect associated with the correlation between the w - boson spin polarization , which is predominantly longitudinal in the top decay and transverse in the direct w - boson decay , and the velocity of the emitted charged lepton . in the signal decay amplitude , @xmath148 ,",
    "the fact that the left handed b - quark must carry the top polarization , forces the lepton to travel with opposite velocity to that of top . in the background decay amplitude , @xmath149 ,",
    "the charged lepton is emitted with a velocity pointing in the same direction as that of the w - boson .",
    "thus , the lorentz boost effects on the emitted charged leptons act in opposite ways for the signal and background events .",
    "while the above distinctive features between signal and background events get further pronounced with increasing center of mass energy , opposite trends occur as the initial energy is lowered .",
    "the distributions at the lep - ii center of mass energy , @xmath150 are plotted in fig.[figtopp192 ] . at this energy , the monovalued distribution for the signal jet , which is now the softer lower energy jet ,",
    "is still well separated from the corresponding background jet distribution .",
    "so , this variable , along with the dijet invariant mass stand up as useful discrimation tests for the signal .",
    "by contrast , the energy and rapidity distributions for the maximum signal jet may not be easily distinguished from the background .",
    "similarly , the lepton energy distributions in the signal and background are overlapping due to the small lorentz boost effect .    the distributions obtained with the rpv interactions are rather similar to those found with the higher dimension operator mechanism .",
    "@xcite this is due to the formal structure of the rpv amplitude , involving an effective @xmath29-channel vector particle exchange .",
    "in fact , the selection cuts proposed by han and hewett @xcite appear to be quite appropriate also in the rpv case , and , for convenience , we recapitulate below the cut conditions used to characterize the selected events .    @xmath151 $ ]    @xmath152 $ ]    @xmath153 $ ]    the above listed variables correspond to the minimum and maximum energy of the two jets , @xmath154 the charged lepton energy , @xmath155 the distance between the dijet invariant mass and w - boson mass , @xmath156 the distance of the reconstructed top mass to the true mass , @xmath157 .",
    "the assigned numerical values are all expressed in gev units .",
    "besides the above cuts , we also impose the usual detection cuts on energies and rapidities , @xmath158 , aimed at removing the particles travelling too close to the beam pipe .",
    "we allow for the detection efficiency of the particle energies only in an approximate way , namely , by accounting for the following approximate uncertainties , @xmath159 , on the jets and lepton energies , respectively , at the level of imposing the above selection cuts , rather than by the usual procedure of performing a gaussian smearing of the particle energies .",
    "the numerically evaluated efficiencies on the signal and background events are , @xmath160 , with a very weak dependence on the center of mass energy and , for the signal , a weak dependence on the mass parameter @xmath70 , which was set at @xmath161 in the numerical simulations . after applying the cuts , the background rates are , @xmath162 \\ fb , $ ] and the signal rates , @xmath163 \\ fb $ ] , for @xmath164 \\ gev$ ] . the results for the cut signal and background rates , as given in table [ table1 ] , show that the background is very significantly reduced by the cuts .",
    "the situation is clearly far more favorable for the future linear colliders than for lep - ii .",
    "nevertheless , the number of surviving signal events is still one order of magnitude below that of the surviving background , so that the option of cutting down the background by means of a @xmath165 quark tagging procedure is to be preferred since the ensuing reduction would be much more drastic .",
    "an integrated luminosity of @xmath166 would lead to a number of signal events , @xmath167 .",
    "we have also performed an indicative event generator study of the background , @xmath168 , restricting consideration to the emitted charged leptons only .",
    "a jet reconstruction of the partonic level distributions is a task beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we focus on the first charged lepton emitted during the semileptonic decays of the produced @xmath169 mesons , since this carries the largest velocity . as seen on fig.[figtopp ]",
    ", the distribution for the first emitted charged lepton energy is peaked at low energies .",
    "one expects that the most energetic lepton is that produced in the semileptonic decays of the @xmath170 mesons .",
    "the rapidity distribution is less central than for the signal and nearly overlaps with that of the @xmath104 background .",
    "therefore , imposing the additional lower bound cut on the lepton energy , say , at @xmath171 , for @xmath172 , should be sufficient to appreciably suppress the @xmath173 background without much affecting the signal .",
    "we may infer the reach with respect to the free parameters by evaluating the statistical significance ratio for a discovery , as defined by , @xmath174 , where @xmath175 denotes the integrated luminosity . setting this at the value , @xmath176 , corresponding to a @xmath177 confidence level",
    ", one deduces a dependence of the rpv coupling constant as a function of the superpartner mass parameters for a fixed initial energy and integrated luminosity .",
    "the sensitivity reach contour plot for the relevant parameters , @xmath178 and @xmath179 , is shown in fig.[figsens ] .",
    "we note that the sensitivity limit on the product of coupling constants , @xmath180 , scales with the luminosity approximately as , @xmath181 .",
    "while the reach on the rpv coupling constants products , @xmath182 , lies well above the current indirect bounds , this covers a wide interval of the down squark mass which extends out to @xmath183 . to compare with analogous collider physics processes",
