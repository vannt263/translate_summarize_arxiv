    "our knowledge of globular cluster ( gc ) systems in spiral and disk galaxies is far more limited than those in elliptical galaxies , and consists primarily of the samples in the milky way and in m31 , along with a handful of more distant disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "these should be compared with the many extensive studies of the gc systems in elliptical galaxies , particularly the giant e s in which gcs can be found by the thousands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* to name only a few ) .",
    "but if we are to probe the systematic properties of the gcs themselves and to understand further the common nature of these classically ancient objects , we need to investigate them closely across all types of host galaxies .    the sombrero galaxy ( m104 = ngc 4594 ) , a giant sa system , is the disk galaxy with the largest known population of globular clusters ( gcs ) and for that reason alone is a particularly attractive system .",
    "the fact that it is distinctly closer ( @xmath3 mpc ) than the virgo cluster , and also nearly edge - on to our line of sight so that our view of its gc population is minimally affected by issues of reddening and contamination from the disk itself , makes m104 an almost unique target .",
    "@xcite , from wide - field ground - based imaging , derive a total gc population of 1900 clusters .",
    "they find that the spatial extent of the system is at least as large as 40 kpc in projected galactocentric distance .    in an earlier study ( * ? ? ?",
    "* which we refer to as paper i ) , a first round of hst - based photometry of m104 gcs and measurements of their scale sizes was presented .",
    "@xcite used the same material to evaluate the trend of mean gc density with galactocentric distance .",
    "the raw data consisted of a special imaging dataset of six fields taken with the acs wide field channel as part of a hubble heritage project on m104 ( pi : k.  noll , pid 9714 ) .",
    "this mosaic was observed in the standard @xmath4 filters ( f435w , f555w , f625w ) and covers a total field size of about @xmath5 centered on m104 . in paper",
    "i , photometry from the individual images was used to discuss the distribution of the gcs in luminosity and color , their spatial distributions around the galaxy , the differences between the red ( metal - rich ) and blue ( metal - poor ) gc subsystems , and the correlations of cluster sizes with gc luminosity and galactocentric distance .",
    "in addition , paper i also provided the first indication that the metal - poor gcs in disk galaxies showed a correlation between mass and metallicity that had already been uncovered for elliptical galaxies .",
    "in the present study , we use the reprocessed mosaic of acs images to measure the gcs in m104",
    ". a particular emphasis of this study is the use of newer algorithms to take a deeper look into the _ intrinsic scale sizes _ of the gcs , and carry out a more extensive set of comparisons with other galaxies .",
    "this work leads us into a physical model for the origin of the gc size distribution that we observe today .    in section 2",
    "we describe in detail the photometry and size measurements . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the correlations of gc scale size with luminosity , metallicity , and galactocentric distance , and show that versions of the `` fundamental plane '' of structural parameters can be accurately constructed for gcs in galaxies this distant . in section 4 ,",
    "we introduce a quantitative model for the physical origin of the gc size distribution .",
    "the present - day gc size must be the result , not only of the slow dynamical evolution of the cluster in the tidal field of the galaxy , but also of the expansion of the protoclusters during their early phase of star formation and rapid gas expulsion .",
    "the key parameters in this model are the original protocluster size , the star formation efficiency , and ( just as importantly ) the dispersions in these two quantities . finally , in section 5 we redetermine the correlations of gc color ( metallicity ) with luminosity for both the bimodal sequences with our new photometry .",
    "we conclude more strongly than before that this galaxy has a mass / metallicity relation quite similar to those in the giant ellipticals .",
    "section 6 gives a brief summary of our findings .",
    "( readers interested primarily in the results may skip directly to section 3 without loss of continuity . )    throughout this paper , we adopt the distance modulus @xmath6 ( @xmath7 mpc ; see table 4 in paper i ) along with a foreground reddening @xmath8 from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) . at the adopted distance ,",
    "the image scale is 1 pixel @xmath9 parsecs .",
    "the most prominent focus of the present discussion is the characteristic scale size of the gcs ( the effective or half - light radius , denoted @xmath10 ) .",
    "we refer to the _ distribution function _ of their sizes ( effective radii ) as the sdf . at the 9-mpc distance of m104 , a gc with a typical size",
    "@xmath11 pc subtends an angular diameter of about @xmath12 , which is similar to the acs / wfc point - spread function width of fwhm @xmath13 . in the sense defined by @xcite , the clusters are therefore in the _ partially resolved _ regime : their individual profiles are easily distinguished from stars , and their effective radii are clearly measurable .",
    "extensive tests of gc profile - fitting for galaxies ranging out to distances of @xmath14 mpc show that gc effective radii can be accurately measured as long as the stellar psf is precisely known and the cluster size @xmath10 is no smaller than about 10% of the psf fwhm @xcite . as will be seen below , the clusters in m104 are far above this resolution limit .",
    "we use our new measurements to establish the sdf more accurately , and to define the `` fundamental plane '' of gc structural parameters in comparison with other galaxies .",
    "the half-_mass _ radius @xmath15 is an interesting and important quantity for gc dynamics because it remains relatively constant over many internal relaxation times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thus represents an intrinsic scale size that was established closer to its formation time . as we will discuss in section 4 below , the physical origin of the sdf is likely to be sensitively dependent on a combination of the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) and the original scale size ( @xmath16 ) of the protoclusters .",
    "the fact that the sdf has a near - universal form among globular cluster systems can then be turned around to place surprisingly close limits on the sfe and @xmath16 .",
    "the hst cameras , beginning with wfpc2 , have provided the key instrumental tools that have allowed us to resolve gcs in galaxies well beyond the local group and to measure their scale sizes accurately .",
    "pioneering work of this type began a decade ago @xcite and the changeover from wfpc2 to the acs camera soon led to faster gains and large databases of cluster sizes ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these surveys of resolved gc populations have started to reveal that @xmath10 also depends weakly on three other cluster properties .",
    "first of these is a gradual increase in mean @xmath10 with _ galactocentric distance _ @xcite .",
    "this trend is generally interpreted as the result of the weaker external tidal field of the host galaxy with increasing distance ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , raising the intriguing possibility that the gc sizes can provide a tracer of the galaxy potential well independently of other approaches .    secondly , in most galaxies a detectable difference in mean size with cluster _",
    "metallicity _ has been found , with the red gcs being typically 15 - 20% smaller than the blue ones ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and paper i ) .",
    "this second trend has been variously interpreted as ( a ) a geometric - projection byproduct of the fact that the metal - richer clusters usually lie in a more centrally concentrated spatial distribution than the metal - poor ones , coupled with the growth in mean @xmath10 with @xmath17 @xcite ; ( b ) a result of metallicity - dependent stellar evolution times and dynamical mass segregation within the clusters @xcite ; or ( c ) a residual of the cluster formation epoch , in which the gas within a metal - richer protocluster could cool and collapse further than in a metal - poor one before forming stars @xcite . combinations of these effects are of course not ruled out .    a third empirically established trend is the correlation of gc scale size with cluster _",
    "luminosity _ or mass .",
    "even though there is obvious cluster - to - cluster scatter in intrinsic sizes , their median scale size differs little with absolute magnitude from a global value of @xmath18 pc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is only at the high - luminosity end ( @xmath19 solar masses and above ) that a trend towards somewhat larger @xmath10 seems to emerge",
    ". this _ mass / radius relation _ may , possibly , bridge the sequence of normal gcs to other kinds of compact stellar systems such as ucds ( ultra - compact dwarfs ) that have scale sizes of typically @xmath20 pc @xcite .",
    "these somewhat more massive compact systems ( variously called ucds , dwarf - globular transition objects ( dgtos ) , or intermediate - mass objects ( imos ) ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) obey a different scaling rule @xmath21 or higher ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "globular clusters luminous enough to lie in this intriguing transition region of @xmath22 are so rare that it is not yet clear whether there is a `` universal '' mass / radius relation for them , or what its detailed form is .    for all the reasons outlined above",
    ", high - quality measurements of gc scale sizes and structural parameters are of great value . because of its proximity and large gc population",
    ", m104 provides one of the few best opportunities for this kind of measurement outside the local group .",
    "preprocessing of the raw image data is described in paper i. the mosaics of six pointings in each filter were constructed at stsci and are publicly available .",
    "paper i also lays out in detail the selection of the many hundreds of individual gcs in m104 field and rejection of contaminating non - gcs scattered across the field .",
    "the contaminants are mostly small , faint background galaxies , but also include any starlike objects ( @xmath23 ) according to the profile fits .",
    "selection also included the use of color , magnitude , and the distribution of objects in a similar control field .",
    "there are some 658 identified high - probability gcs brighter than @xmath24 plus one ucd in the final selected list , and we start the present paper with that list in hand .    in paper",
    "i , the ishape code of @xcite was used to determine the gc effective radii through convolution of @xcite model profiles with the stellar psf . in each of the six original acs / wfc fields a single mean psf",
    "was defined , and a profile with a central concentration parameter @xmath25 was adopted . for each individual cluster the intrinsic profile width @xmath10 ( in practice , the fwhm ) is varied until a best fit between the convolved profile and the real gc is obtained .    .",
    "the 659 gc candidates are shown as open circles , while the 179 stars used for the psfs are marked as small dots .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , it does not easily handle situations where the psf may depend on position on the image , and at a more fundamental level it uses only analytic fitting functions to describe the gc profiles .",
    "although the @xcite function was constructed to match real gcs in the first place , it does not capture the full range of actual profile shapes for gcs , ucds , and related objects .",
    "for the present work , we use the profile - fitting code of @xcite .",
    "this code has been applied previously to gcs in the milky way , the magellanic clouds , m31 , and ngc 5128 @xcite . for the intrinsic gc profile",
    ", this algorithm can employ either the @xcite or @xcite profiles , both of which are true dynamical models constructed from simple but realistic assumptions about the energy distribution function of the stars within the cluster . in the discussion",
    "below , we refer to these models as `` k66 '' and `` w75 . ''",
    "although these non - analytic models require a much larger investment in computing time , their best - fit solutions lead immediately to physically relevant quantities such as relaxation times , mean densities , binding energies , and fundamental - plane parameters @xcite .",
    "a roughly similar code ( kingphot ) has been used for gcs in the virgo galaxies @xcite .",
    "although the king model is quite familiar in the literature and describes most real gcs satisfactorily , the wilson model has some distinct advantages in its ability to handle real clusters that have symmetric but _ radially extended _",
    "light profiles which ( within the confines of the king model ) would nominally be thought to have `` extra - tidal light '' . as is extensively discussed by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the key difference in the wilson model is its smoother ramp - down of the stellar energy distribution function towards higher energies , which can handle relatively larger numbers of stars near the escape energy and a more extended envelope with a nominally larger tidal radius .",
    "it is important to note that for small to moderate radii within the cluster ( that is , out to a few @xmath10 ) , both the king and wilson models give very similar profile shapes and do equally well at fitting most real clusters .",
    "these inner regions are populated by the low - energy stars far inside the tidal ( escape ) radius where the difference in the energy distribution function between the two models is small . for the clusters in the nearby local group galaxies where",
    "the profiles can be thoroughly sampled over large radii , the wilson model often performs better , but ( as is shown in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) there is no blanket ruling ; decisions are made on a cluster - by - cluster basis .",
    "the sombrero acs mosaic field does , however , offer a particularly vivid case where there is a strong difference between these two models .",
    "there is a single clearly identifiable luminous ucd belonging to the galaxy , whose profile has an extended outer envelope which is accurately fit by the wilson model but where the king model completely fails . we have discussed this special object in detail in @xcite . in the present study , we apply both of these two dynamical model profiles to the complete sample of gcs in the galaxy and explicitly compare their quality of fit .",
    "the profile - fitting code is the same one described fully in @xcite . for each object ,",
    "a stellar psf ( either an analytic function or an empirical numeric profile ) is convolved with the k66 or w75 model , and the model parameters are adjusted until the convolution fits the observed surface brightness profile of the cluster .",
    "we carried out all the measurements on the complete wide - field mosaic for the entire field , rather than the six individual fields as in paper i. the measurements were done from smoothed ( median - filtered ) images in each filter with the large - scale light gradients removed .",
    "a @xmath26 px box filter was used for the median filtering .",
    "we then used _ stsdas / ellipse _ to measure the radial profile for each gc in our list , out to a radius determined by the point past which the gc surface brightness fell well below the sky noise ; this limit ranged from @xmath27 for the most luminous objects to @xmath13 for the very faintest ones .    to define the psf profile that needs to be paired up with each gc , we chose here to select the _",
    "nearest star _ to each individual gc , as we did in @xcite . in this way we circumvent trying to model the small but potentially complex variation in psf properties across the complete mosaic of six acs fields .",
    "the stars are , in turn , empirically defined as those objects in our paper i study that turned out to have negligible intrinsic widths ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we drew the psf stars from a candidate list of 179 stars with sufficiently high s / n , so the average projected separation between any one gc and its accompanying psf star is @xmath29 .",
    "the profiles of the stars were also measured through _",
    "stdas / ellipse _ with the same parameters , and each gc / psf pair was then run through the fitting code to find the best - fit solutions .",
    "the locations of the 658 target gcs and one ucd measured previously , along with the 179 candidate psf stars , are shown in figure [ xyplot ] . as is evident from the figure",
    ", we deliberately avoid the parts of the galaxy projected on or near the plane of the disk , where the profile fits would be badly compromised by complex background light gradients and crowding .",
    "lastly , we re - derive integrated magnitudes @xmath30 for all the gcs with aperture photometry individually adjusted for cluster profile width .",
    "the approach we use is similar in principle to @xcite , where in this case we start with a fixed - aperture magnitude measured through 5 px radius ( @xmath31 ) and then apply a magnitude correction to `` large '' radius ( 20 px ) @xmath32 that depends in turn on the cluster s scale size @xmath10 . by direct comparison of the aperture magnitudes from ishape through these two apertures ( figure [ apcorr ] ) , we find that @xmath33 increases nearly linearly with log ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath34 and does not differ significantly with bandpass .",

    "if the number of datapoints in the bin is less than about 50 , the solutions need to be partially constrained for convergence ; here , we choose in such cases to fix the dispersions @xmath40 because these do not change noticeably along the sequence and we are primarily interested in tracing the mean colors themselves . by using the total data over @xmath41 we find @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "the blue and red clusters make up nearly equal proportions of the total population ; the @xmath45 ratio increases steadily toward higher luminosity and the blue sequence reaches a bit higher at the top end . as expected from both the previous literature and the self - enrichment model , the red sequence does not show a significant change in mean color with luminosity ( that is , it has a `` zero '' mmr ) .",
    "by contrast , the blue sequence shows a clear slope toward the red that is nearly linear in form .",
    "an unweighted linear fit to the mean points in table [ rmixtab ] gives a highly significant slope @xmath46 , almost identical with what was derived in paper i. in terms of heavy - element abundance @xmath47 this slope corresponds to a scaling @xmath48 ( see below ) .",
    "the slope of the linear fit becomes progressively less significant as the higher - luminosity bins are removed .",

    "detailed comparisons with the self - enrichment model of @xcite show that a close first - order match to the data can be obtained with the same choice of star formation efficiency and protocluster size that are required to successfully model the sdf . however , a potential problem for the model may lie in whether or not the mmr extends further down the blue sequence below the point where self - enrichment can be expected to work .",

    "<S> images from the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys are used to carry out a new photometric study of the globular clusters ( gcs ) in m104 , the sombrero galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the primary focus of our study is the characteristic distribution function of linear sizes ( sdf ) of the gcs . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the effective radii for 652 clusters with psf - convolved king and wilson dynamical model fits . </S>",
    "<S> the sdf is remarkably similar to those measured for other large galaxies of all types , adding strong support to the view that it is a `` universal '' feature of globular cluster systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the sombrero and milky way data and the formation models of baumgardt & kroupa ( 2007 ) to develop a more general interpretation of the size distribution function for globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the shape of the sdf that we see today for gcs is strongly influenced by the early rapid mass loss during their star forming stage , coupled with stochastic differences from cluster to cluster in the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) and their initial sizes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the observed sdf shape can be accurately predicted by a simple model in which the protocluster clouds had characteristic sizes of @xmath0 pc and sfes of @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the colors and luminosities of the m104 clusters show the clearly defined classic bimodal form . </S>",
    "<S> the blue sequence exhibits a mass / metallicity relation ( mmr ) , following a scaling of heavy - element abundance with luminosity of @xmath2 very similar to what has been found in most giant elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative self - enrichment model provides a good first - order match to the data for the same initial sfe and protocluster size that were required to explain the sdf .    </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss various forms of the globular cluster fundamental plane ( fp ) of structural parameters , and show that useful tests of it can be extended to galaxies beyond the local group . </S>",
    "<S> the m104 clusters strongly resemble those of the milky way and other nearby systems in terms of such test quantities as integrated surface density and binding energy .    </S>",
