    "among the most remarkable discoveries made during the early days of the vlbi technique was the apparent superluminal motion exhibited by the jets of some extragalactic radio sources ( e.g. , whitney et al . 1971 ; cohen et al .",
    "1971 ) , which can be explained as a relativistic jet moving nearly along the line of sight ( e.g. , blandford & knigl 1979 ) .",
    "multi - epoch studies of various individual sources began soon after the discovery of this phenomenon , with different research groups taking the responsibility for monitoring different sources with ad hoc vlbi arrays .",
    "however , the need was soon recognized for multi - epoch surveys of many sources so that the apparent speeds of relativistic jets could be studied in a uniform manner , both to learn about the jets themselves , and to use in applications ranging from unified models of agn to cosmology .",
    "early efforts to assemble multi - epoch data for many sources relied on collecting single - source results from the literature ( e.g. , vermeulen & cohen 1994 ) , but such assemblages can be biased because they include only the data that observers have elected to publish .",
    "observing and reducing multiple epochs of vlbi data on many sources is a time consuming task that became manageable with the advent of dedicated vlbi arrays such as the national radio astronomy observatory s very long baseline array ( vlba ) and the european vlbi network ( evn ) , and the past few years have seen publication of results from two large multi - epoch vlbi surveys ( here ` large ' is defined as exceeding about 500 images in the survey ) , which we summarize below .",
    "the caltech - jodrell bank flat - spectrum survey ( cjf ) is a complete flux - limited sample of 293 flat - spectrum radio sources , drawn from the 6  cm and 20  cm green bank surveys .",
    "the cjf survey has obtained 3 - 5 epochs of vlbi data at 5 ghz spanning 4 - 8 years on each of these 293 sources , over the years 1990 - 2000 ( vermeulen et al .",
    "2003 ) , with a typical separation between observations of about two years ( britzen et al .",
    "some results on the measured apparent speeds , including statistics derived from 597 component speed measurements in 262 sources , are given by vermeulen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the 2  cm survey ( kellermann et al . 1998 ; zensus et al . 2002 ; kellermann et al . 2004 ; kovalev et al . 2005 ) observed a smaller number of sources than the cjf survey , but at a higher angular resolution because the observations were at a higher frequency of 15 ghz ( wavelength of 2  cm ) .",
    "this survey consisted of multi - epoch observations with the vlba of over 100 sources between the years 1994 and 2001 .",
    "the jet kinematics derived from these observations are presented by kellermann et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( hereafter k04 ) . that paper presents apparent speeds for 208 jet features in 110 sources , measured from an average of 6 epochs per source over the years 1994 to 2001 , yielding a typical epoch spacing for each source of about one observation per year . since 2001",
    ", the 2  cm survey has continued as the mojave survey , with polarization observations added , and with a somewhat altered source list to ensure a statistically complete sample .",
    "first epoch results from the mojave survey are presented by lister & homan ( 2005 ) ( linear polarization measurements ) and homan & lister ( 2006 ) ( circular polarization measurements ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present results from a new multi - epoch vlbi kinematic survey , drawn from the u.s .",
    "naval observatory s radio reference frame image database ( rrfid ) .",
    "the radio reference frame image database is the result of an ongoing program to image radio reference frame sources on a regular basis .",
    "the goal is to establish a database of images of all radio reference frame sources at the same wavelengths as those used for precise astrometry .",
    "the multi - epoch vlbi data allow the monitoring of sources for variability or structural changes so that they can be evaluated for continued suitability as radio reference frame objects .",
    "rrfid observations are performed with the full ten - station vlba with the addition of up to ten geodetic vlbi antennas for global vlbi coverage .",
    "observations are performed simultaneously at frequencies of 8 and 2 ghz .",
    "observations began in 1994 and have continued through the present , however the rrfid image database is currently well - filled only through the end of 1998 , covering the first five years of observations . at this writing ,",
    "the database contains 4164 images of 517 sources .",
    "imaging results from this database have been presented by fey , clegg , & fomalont ( 1996 ) ; fey & charlot ( 1997 ) ; and fey & charlot ( 2000 ) .",
    "the rrfid has also recently begun to include multi - epoch vlba observations at higher frequencies of 24 and 43  ghz ( k- and q - band ) .",
    "the rrfid is not a flux - limited sample , and membership in the database is limited to those sources useful for astrometry or geodesy .",
    "sources selected for astrometry and geodesy have historically been the brightest known compact sources .",
    "the source list has evolved over time as the arrays used evolved and included longer baselines and became more sensitive , thus rejecting sources previously considered compact in favor of weaker , more core dominated sources that are known to produce consistent geodetic results .",
    "there has also been an attempt to select sources as uniformly distributed on the sky as possible  this can only be carried so far , but gets easier as the sensitivity to weaker sources increases .",
    "the final result is that while the rrfid contains many observations of well - known sources ( for example , bl lac ) , there are other well - known sources ( for example , 3c  273 ) that are not well - represented in the database . on the other hand ,",
    "some strong sources that may have been only sparsely observed by the astronomical community have very good coverage in the rrfid .",
    "because of this historical evolution of the source list , the exact nature of the biases that this lack of pre - defined selection criteria may introduce into statistical quantities calculated from the rrfid is not known .",
    "this paper presents the results of a vlbi kinematic survey ( hereafter the rrfid kinematic survey ) , selected as a subset of the currently available observations in the rrfid . for this paper",
    ", we have selected all 8 ghz observations of all sources observed at 3 or more epochs between the beginning of the database in 1994 july through the last nearly contiguous epoch in the database in 1998 december  this subset covers 19 astrometric vlba experiments .",
    "these selection criteria yield a total of 87 sources with a total of 966 8 ghz images . for these 87 sources , there are then an average of 11 epochs per source over this five year timespan , with the best observed sources being observed at all 19 epochs .",
    "this survey thus covers a slightly smaller number of sources than the 2  cm survey , but with about twice the average number of epochs per source .",
    "the epoch spacing in the rrfid is not evenly distributed  there are six astrometric vlba experiments from the three years 1994 - 1996 ( yielding an average epoch spacing of about 0.5 years for sources observed at all epochs ) , and thirteen astrometric vlba experiments from the two years 1997 - 1998 ( yielding an average epoch spacing of about 2 months for sources observed at all epochs ) .",
    "astrometric vlba experiments ( the rdv series ) have continued to use an epoch spacing of about 2 months since 1998 .",
    "this survey thus explores the jet kinematics using a much smaller average epoch spacing than has been used in previous large vlbi surveys , and this is potentially quite important ( jorstad et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and homan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used similarly short time spacing , but for smaller numbers of sources ) .",
    "a persistent problem in the interpretation of multi - epoch vlbi images is in the identification of jet ` components ' from epoch - to - epoch across the series of images  this is arguably the most subjective step in the usual process of measuring jet apparent speeds .",
    "a subset of sources may exhibit clear motions of bright well - separated features , but in other sources there can be ambiguities in the identification of features that can be influenced by the epoch spacing of the observations .",
    "( in particular , a ` strobing ' effect can cause a larger number of rapidly moving features to be interpreted as a smaller number of slower moving features . )",
    "this general problem of component identifications is discussed in the context of the cjf survey by vermeulen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . about half of the sources included in this paper are also included in the 2  cm survey ( many of the other half have not previously been observed with multi - epoch vlbi ) , and for those sources that are common to both surveys we are able to perform a detailed comparison of our apparent speed measurements with those of k04 over the same time range , in order to determine if different epoch spacings influence the measurement of jet speeds .",
    "this is the first time known to us that such a large comparison of kinematic results for the same sources from different vlbi surveys has been attempted , and such a comparison is important for assessing the repeatability of apparent speed measurements .",
    "we note that the application of geodetic or astrometric vlbi data to astrophysics is not new , see , for example , the study of geodetic vlbi observations of egret blazars by piner & kingham ( 1997a ; 1997b ; 1998 ) .",
    "what is different about this application of geodetic vlbi data is that now the data are drawn from observations with the vlba that have been designed for accurate imaging of the source structure , so that the images are of much higher quality than the images in those earlier papers that relied solely on data from dedicated geodetic antennas .    in this paper",
    "we present only the jet apparent speeds from the first five years of 8 ghz data in the rrfid .",
    "future papers in this series will study other aspects of jet astrophysics from both the 8 and 2 ghz data in the rrfid such as : correlations of the jet apparent speeds with other source properties , bending of the parsec - scale jets and their misalignment with kiloparsec - scale structures , transverse structures ( or lack thereof ) in the parsec - scale jets , and measurements of jet apparent speeds using an expanded time baseline of data ( once observations from the years after 1998 are added to the rrfid ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in @xmath2[obs ] we describe the rrfid observations in detail , in @xmath2[data ] we describe the procedures used in calibrating , imaging , and model fitting the data , in @xmath2[results ] we present the kinematic results , and in @xmath2[comp ] we compare those kinematic results to those obtained by the 2  cm survey ( k04 ) for the common sources . throughout this paper",
    "we assume cosmological parameters @xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "when results from other papers are quoted , they have been converted to this cosmology .",
    "observations were made using the 10 antennas of the vlba ( napier et  al .",
    "1994 ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) , along with an array consisting of up to 7 geodetic antennas ( gilcreek  fairbanks , ak ; nrao20  green bank , wv ; kokee  kokee park , hi ; medicina  medicina , italy ; nyales20  ny alesund , norway ; onsala60  onsala , sweden ; & westford  westford , ma ) .",
    "eight intermediate frequencies ( ifs ) were recorded simultaneously , each eight mhz wide , with four at s - band ( 2.24 , 2.27 , 2.36 , & 2.38 ghz ) and four at x - band ( 8.41 , 8.48 , 8.79 , & 8.90 ghz ) for a total bandwidth of 32  mhz in each frequency band .",
    "observations were made in a dual - frequency bandwidth synthesis mode to facilitate delay measurements for geodesy and astrometry .",
    "the multiplicity of channels allows for the determination of a precise group delay ( rogers 1970 ) , while simultaneous observations in two bands allows for an accurate calibration of the frequency dependent propagation delay introduced by the ionosphere .",
    "results of the precise geodesy and astrometry afforded by these observations has been presented elsewhere ( e.g. , petrov & ma 2003 ; fey et  al . 2004 ) . observations in this mode also allow simultaneous dual - frequency imaging , which is the focus of the work discussed here .",
    "of order 100 sources are observed in a single 24-hour experiment , for an average time on source per experiment of about 15 minutes .",
    "this time on source is divided into scans of a minute to a few minutes in length that are spread throughout the 24-hour observing period .",
    "table  [ obstab ] shows the 19 vlba experiments that are included in this paper .",
    "as can be seen from this table , the earlier experiments ( 1994 - 1996 ) are spaced more sporadically in time and used only the 10-station vlba .",
    "the later vlba experiments , corresponding with the beginning of the rdv series in 1997 , are spaced roughly every two months in time , and these used the full vlba plus up to seven geodetic antennas .",
    "the rdv experiment series has continued to observe every two months through the present ( and is currently up to rdv57 ) , but the epochs after rdv12 are not yet fully integrated into the rrfid .    [ obstab ]",

    "the vlba beam size is about a factor of two larger at 8 ghz than at 15 ghz , thus the rrfid images that are vlba - only ( the first eight epochs in table  [ obstab ] ) have about a factor of two worse angular resolution than the 2  cm survey images .",
    "however , the global vlbi beam size at 8 ghz is approximately equal to the vlba beam size at 15 ghz , so that the later epochs in the rrfid that used global vlbi networks have similar angular resolution to the 2  cm survey observations .",
    "the rrfid observations use about one - quarter of the time on source and half the bandwidth of the 2  cm survey observations , and this implies a loss of sensitivity by a factor of a few relative to the 2  cm survey .",
    "however , these factors are compensated for by the greater number of antennas in most of the rrfid observations , the lower sefd ( system equivalent flux density ) of the antennas at 8 ghz relative to 15 ghz , and the higher flux of the jet components at 8 ghz .",
    "the result of all of these factors is that the dynamic range of the jet detections in the two surveys is similar .",
    "because of their very different setups , it is fortuitous that the rrfid images and the 2  cm survey images are similar in angular resolution and jet dynamic range ; this similarity greatly facilitates the comparisons between the results of the two surveys in @xmath2[comp ] .",
    "gaussian models were fit to the self - calibrated _ visibility data _ on a source - by - source basis using difmap in an interactive mode .",
    "the number of gaussian components and the choice between elliptical components or circular components was subjective , but motivated by consideration of the simplicity of the resulting model .",
    "thus , elliptical components were used sparingly , and only to represent the core or a very bright jet component when the residuals remaining from a circular gaussian fit were so large as to hinder further model fitting using the residual map .",
    "although the agreement between the fitted models and the data is not as good as that produced by the hybrid images ( models with many clean components ) , inspection of plots of residuals in the image plane , after subtracting the gaussian models from the visibility data , revealed that the gaussian models generally describe the visibility data quite well .",
    "however , because of incomplete sampling in the @xmath12-plane , these models may not be unique .",
    "they represent only one _ possible _ deconvolution of complex source structure .",
    "such deconvolutions can be misleading .",
    "the models were fit to the self - calibrated visibility data corresponding to the publicly available images in the radio reference frame image database , no further processing of the visibility data was performed , so others should be able to reproduce the models given here from the publicly available data . the models published here were done independently from the previously published models of five epochs of rrfid data by fey et al .",

    "any difference between these model fits lies in the presence of an additional component or components in one or the other of the fits , i.e , any difference results from a differing decision of when to stop adding components to the residual map ; and in these cases one model is basically a subset of the other . in a small number ( @xmath15 ) of cases",

    "the above procedure was used to set the default value for @xmath25 , but since there are other factors that influence the model - fitting accuracy , such as the presence or absence of other confusing components , @xmath25 was adjusted from this default value if the error bars were obviously way too large or too small ( based on the significance of the fit ) , on a case - by - case basis .",
    "we also computed all apparent speeds and associated errors a second time with no errors applied to the individual position measurements , and the speed error calculated from the dispersion about the linear fit , as was done for the 2  cm survey data by k04 .",

    "we retain the method described in the previous paragraph , because , while the data in figure  3 from which the flux dependence is derived is somewhat sparse , it at least takes into account the changing resolutions from the early to the late epochs ( which went from vlba - only to global vlbi , see table  [ obstab ] ) by assigning beam - based errors , and it is consistent with the values obtained from the dispersion about the linear fits .",
    "an inspection of table  4 shows a significant number of negative apparent speeds ( about 25% of component speeds ) .",
    "a negative apparent speed corresponds to inward motion toward the presumed core , and would be physically important if convincingly detected . however , all of the negative apparent speeds in table  4 are under 3@xmath145 significance , and we regard these as most likely due to stationary or slowly moving components that happen to have a formally negative best - fit apparent speed .",
    "in fact , when we look at the distribution of significances of the negative apparent speeds , they match closely a normal distribution centered at zero ( 34% have over 1@xmath145 significance , 8% have over 2@xmath145 significance ) , supporting the interpretation in terms of stationary or slowly moving components .",

    "note that there are some apparent speeds listed in table  4 with extremely large associated errors ( e.g. , the two components in 1255 - 316 , with formal errors on the measured apparent speeds of about 50@xmath1 ) .",
    "this has usually occurred because the rrfid is not a survey that was specifically designed to measure jet kinematics , so occasionally a source may be observed for only a few epochs over a period of a few months . observing a component over a period of only a few months at 8 ghz yields large errors on the measured apparent speeds .",
    "we include these components in table  4 for completeness , and to show the current state of the rrfid observations of these sources , but we caution that there is little or no information contained in those particular speed measurements , so that _ they should not be used by anyone for any reason_.    to aid in the comparison to the 2  cm survey presented in @xmath2  [ comp ] , we assigned quality codes to each component motion using the same criteria used by k04 .",
    "these criteria are :    1 .",
    "the component is observed at four or more epochs .",
    "2 .   the component is a well - defined feature in the images .",
    "the uncertainty in the fitted proper motion is @xmath146 mas yr@xmath4 , or the proper motion has a significance @xmath147 .",

    "g ( good ) for motions that satisfy any two of the above criteria .",
    "f ( fair ) for motions that satisfy only one of the above criteria . 4 .",

    "this selection criterion excludes 90 of the 184 measured apparent speeds in table  4 , leaving a total of 94 apparent speeds in 54 sources that are used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "we note that because of the difference between the time baseline of the currently analyzed rrfid data ( 5 years ) and that of the 2  cm survey ( 8 years ) , our typical uncertainty in fitted proper motions is about a factor of 8/5 larger than the typical uncertainty from k04 , causing a smaller yield of excellent and good components ( about 50% of our components ) compared to k04 ( about 75% of their components ) , due to the application of criterion ( 3 ) above .",

    "such stationary components are also observed to be common in the other large multi - epoch vlbi surveys , including the radio - selected 2  cm and cjf surveys ( k04 ; vermeulen 1995 ) , and the vlbi survey of egret blazars by jorstad et al .",

    "( 2001 ) suggested that multiple slowly - moving conical shocks formed from the interaction of superluminal components with the underlying jet could also produce apparently stationary components on vlbi maps .",
    "we have quantitatively compared the distribution shown in figure  4 with the apparent speed distributions obtained by other authors using the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test . a direct comparison of the histogram in figure  4 with the corresponding histogram for the 2  cm survey from k04 shows a difference at the 95% significance level ; however , this difference is solely the result of the greater scatter toward negative apparent speeds of the presumably stationary components caused by the approximately 8/5 greater statistical uncertainty in the rrfid proper motions mentioned above .",
    "if the negative apparent speeds from both surveys are grouped in their respective @xmath150 bins , then the k - s test finds no significant difference between the distribution of apparent speeds measured here and that measured by the 2  cm survey .",
    "note that even though the general shapes of the overall apparent speed distributions agree quite well between this paper and k04 , specific results for some individual sources shared by the two surveys do differ , see @xmath2[comp ] for a full discussion .",

    "this type of difference is expected if the gamma - ray emission is more highly beamed than the radio emission ; however , see the further discussion of this issue in @xmath2[gamma ] .    different components within the same jet can have different apparent speeds , as obviously demonstrated by the co - existence of fast moving and stationary components in the same source .",
    "approximately one - third of the sources that have multiple components in figure  4 have apparent speeds that are different from each other at greater than 99% confidence . however , the dispersion of apparent speeds for individual sources is typically less than that for the sample as a whole , as was also found by k04 for the 2  cm survey .",
    "for the 27 sources that have multiple components in figure  4 , all but five have a dispersion of their apparent speeds that is less than the dispersion of all components in figure  4 taken together ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "this demonstrates the existence of a ` characteristic speed ' associated with individual jets .",
    "analysis of correlations between the fastest observed apparent speed in a source and other source properties using the 2  cm and mojave survey samples ( lister 2006 ) has suggested that the fastest observed pattern speed in a source is a good indicator of bulk apparent speed .",
    "the ` characteristic speed ' mentioned above may then be the bulk flow speed of the jet , with individual components moving at pattern speeds ranging from zero up to this bulk flow speed .",
    "a scenario such as this would be consistent with jet simulations such as those of agudo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , where primary disturbances moving at the jet flow speed spawn secondary ` components ' that move at slower pattern speeds ( or are stationary ) . in this interpretation ,",
    "the maximum apparent speed in a source , measured over a time interval of many years , would be the most reliable indicator of bulk lorentz factor . in figure  5",
    ", we show the distribution of maximum apparent speeds for the rrfid sample .",
    "the figure shows a histogram of the fastest measured pattern speed in each of the 54 sources represented in figure  4 .",
    "the mean fastest apparent speed in a source is @xmath153 .",
    "note that an excess of stationary components could still be produced in such a plot if some sources had not yet been observed over a long enough time interval to see a component moving at the apparent bulk speed .",
    "figure  6 shows the distribution in figure  5 separated by the optical type given in table  [ sources ] into quasars and bl lac objects .",
    "( because only three sources in figure  5 are classified as galaxies , we do not show a separate histogram for the galaxies . )",

    "why this difference should be statistically more significant for the groups of gamma - ray selected quasars and bl lac objects than for the radio - selected groups is unclear .          in this subsection",
    ", we check for two different types of apparent accelerations in the modeling data .",
    "first , we perform second - order fits to @xmath17 versus @xmath156 ( three free parameters ) , to check for apparent radial accelerations or decelerations that could be caused by a changing lorentz factor , angle to the line - of - sight , or direction of motion . the thirteen closely spaced epochs during 1997 and 1998 should give some sensitivity to such second - order terms in the apparent radial motion .",
    "secondly , we perform first order fits to @xmath157 versus @xmath156 and @xmath158 versus @xmath156 ( four free parameters ) , which allows us to fit for a direction of motion of the component that may be different from its mean position angle , or nonradial . with the current time baseline and resolution of the rrfid data ,",
    "higher - order fits with more free parameters do not give meaningful results , although they will as the time baseline of the rrfid continues to be extended in future papers .",
    "we fit all components that were observed at four or more epochs ( 161 components ) with a second - order polynomial for @xmath159 . to check for significant accelerations , we considered all components where the second - order term had greater than 2@xmath145 significance .",
    "there were 17 such components , where @xmath160 such @xmath161 detections are expected by chance alone , suggesting some detections of real accelerations . from those 17 components ,",
    "we exclude those with ` fair ' or ` poor ' quality codes , and those where the extremum of the second - order function occurs within the time range of the component observations .",
    "such fits would represent a component that reverses its direction of motion during the observed time interval  we consider this physically unlikely , and expect that these results are caused by a statistically abnormally high or low point or points in the midst of the component position data .",
    "there remain three components that we consider to be the most likely detections of radial accelerations : component c2 in 0234 + 285 ( @xmath162 mas yr@xmath163 ) , component c1 in 1308 + 326 ( @xmath164 mas yr@xmath163 ) , and component c1 in 2200 + 420 ( @xmath165 mas yr@xmath163 ) .",
    "two of these accelerations are positive and one is negative . a positive apparent radial acceleration could be due to an increase in the bulk lorentz factor of the component ( as is suggested to occur on parsec scales in some models , such as the accelerating mhd jet model of vlahakis & knigl 2004 ) , or to a bend toward the critical viewing angle for maximum apparent speed .",
    "negative apparent radial accelerations could be caused by a decrease in the bulk lorentz factor , a bend away from the critical angle , or a curved trajectory that acquires a significant nonradial component .",
    "in fact , two of these three sources do have detectable nonradial motions , as discussed below .",
    "these various scenarios will also produce variations in the apparent brightness of the component as the beaming factor changes , but such variations are complicated by not knowing the true viewing angle or intrinsic variability of the component .",
    "the second - order radial fits discussed above are limited to detecting apparent acceleration of a component in the radial direction . in order to check for possible nonradial ( non - ballistic ) trajectories of components",
    ", we have also fit first - order linear functions separately to @xmath166 and @xmath167 , as was also done for the 2  cm survey sources by k04 .",
    "these fits then determine a direction of motion , as well as the magnitude of the vector velocity .",
    "they allow determination of possible nonradial trajectories by comparison of the fitted direction of motion with the average position angle of the component .",
    "such non - ballistic trajectories may be caused by flow of the jet plasma along a curving channel , and such trajectories have previously been detected in numerous individual source studies ( dating back to at least zensus , cohen , & unwin [ 1995 ] , for quasar 3c  345 ) . for consistency , we use here the same criteria as k04 for determining what constitutes a significant detection of non - radial motion ; namely , that the fit must meet the following conditions : the component must be detected at at least five epochs , the vector velocity magnitude must be of at least 5@xmath145 significance , and the fitted direction of motion must differ from the mean position angle of the component by at least 3@xmath145 .",
    "a total of eighteen components satisfy the first two criteria , and of these six have significant nonradial motion according to the third criterion .",
    "a third of the best - determined motions in the current rrfid sample are nonradial , the same fraction that was found for the 2  cm survey by k04 .",
    "the fit values for these six components are tabulated in table  [ nonradialtab ] .",
    "some components that are apparently stationary when only radial motion is considered may turn out to have significant velocity magnitudes when the total velocity is taken into account ( e.g. , c2 in 0823 + 033 and c1 in 1611 + 343 ) . of the six sources listed in table  [ nonradialtab ] , five are also in the 2  cm survey ( all except for 1622 - 253 ) , but for 1611 + 343 and 2136 + 141",

    "regardless of the agreement or lack thereof on specific sources , these two large vlbi surveys agree that roughly one third of well - measured component trajectories are nonradial , conclusively ruling out a purely ballistic model of the motion of radio - emitting components .",

    "interestingly , many very bright radio blazars were _ not _ detected above the egret threshold in gev gamma - rays ( including , for example , 4c  39.25 from this survey ) , raising the question of why many radio - loud blazars had strong , detectable gamma - ray emission while others did not .",
    "one possible explanation for this is that the gamma - ray and radio emission are relativistically beamed by different powers of the doppler factor , with the gamma - ray emission being the more highly beamed .",
    "this enhancement of doppler beaming in gamma - rays occurs in the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model for gamma - ray emission simply because of the steeper spectral index in the gamma - ray portion of the spectrum . in the external - radiation compton ( erc )",

    "if the gamma - ray emission is more highly beamed than the radio emission , then the egret blazars should be biased toward higher doppler factors than radio - selected samples . assessing the effect of differing doppler factors on observed apparent speeds is not trivial  interior to the critical angle that maximizes apparent speed the doppler factor will be negatively correlated with apparent speed , while outside this angle the correlation will be positive ; so that one can not simply conclude that higher doppler factors will produce faster jets . instead",
    ", these effects must be studied through monte - carlo simulations of the populations under consideration .",
    "simulations by lister ( 1999 ) , assuming a linear relation between radio and gamma - ray luminosity , have shown that , in a radio - selected flux - limited sample , the egret detected subset should indeed have systematically faster apparent speeds than the non - detections .",

    "is problematic , and ideally the gamma - ray and radio - selected samples should be observed at the same frequencies .",
    "k04 split the 2  cm survey sources into two groups based on their egret detection or non - detection , and found that the apparent speed distributions of the two groups differed , but at a relatively low significance level of 90% . here",

    "a k - s test also shows no significant difference between the fastest apparent speeds of the egret and non - egret sources",
    ". however , neither the 2  cm survey nor the rrfid survey represent a complete sample of gamma - ray sources , so both will be biased toward those egret sources with higher radio fluxes .",
    "the issue is likely to remain open until large flux - limited samples in both wavebands are studied with vlbi with identical experimental setups .",

    "of the 77 sources included in table  4 , 36 , or about half , also have measured apparent speeds published by k04 from the 2  cm survey data .",
    "this provides a unique opportunity to compare the results from the two surveys for the common sources , in order to see if the standard procedure of vlbi model - fitting , component identification , and linear fitting yields reproducible results for the apparent speeds when the same sources are analyzed using different datasets by different groups . to aid in this comparison , all kinematic results in this paper",
    "were produced ` blind ' with respect to the 2  cm survey results , and the comparisons in this section were not made until after the kinematic results in @xmath2[appspeed ] had been finalized .",

    "* different component identification schemes : * a subset of sources exists where both the 2  cm survey and the rrfid kinematic survey have measured similar positions for model - fit components at similar epochs , but where the components have been identified differently from epoch to epoch to yield different sets of ` components ' with different speeds . the source 1606 + 106 in figure  8 provides an example of this . if one considers the data for component 3 in this source from the rrfid kinematic survey ( black triangles on figure  8 and associated black - line fit ) , then it can be seen that there is a matching 2  cm survey component in 1996 ( identified as their component d ) , another in 1997 ( identified as their component c ) , and another in 1999 ( identified as their component b ) .",
    "this is typical of this general problem  one survey has interpreted the position data as a smaller number of more slowly moving components , while the other has interpreted it with a larger number of faster components . in these cases , it is the spacing of the epochs in time that is the major influence on component identification . for 1606 + 106 , the dense spacing of the rrfid position data during 1997 and 1998 seems to preclude the faster interpretation of k04 .",
    "four other sources where differing component identification schemes have yielded significantly different apparent speed measurements are indicated by the ` i d ' code in the final column of table  [ comptab ] .",
    "none of these components were recorded as ` distinct features ' in _ both _ surveys , so that seeing a component as a distinct rather than a blended feature on the images evidently helps prevent ambiguities in component identification .",
    "in addition , there are five other sources where components were identified differently by the two surveys , but where the motions did not meet the criteria for inclusion in table  [ comptab ] , or where this did not result in apparent speed differences at the cutoff significance level specified for the analysis in this section . in total",
    ", different component identification schemes were used for 10 of the 36 common sources . for those discrepant sources that have densely spaced rrfid observations during 1997 and 1998",
    ", we expect that the more densely spaced rrfid data should better resolve potential ambiguities in component identification .",
    "ambiguities in identifying vlbi components from epoch to epoch has long been discussed as a potential problem for multi - epoch vlbi observations ( see , for example , the discussion of this issue in the context of the cjf survey by vermeulen et al . [ 2003 ] ) . however ,",
    "this is the first time that this issue has been quantitatively addressed using independently analyzed datasets for a sizable number of common sources .",
    "if the results from this paper can be extrapolated to similar multi - epoch vlbi studies , then roughly 25% of the apparent speed measurements in the literature may not be repeatable , in the sense that other observers using a similar but independent set of vlbi observations may have reached different conclusions about the apparent speeds .",
    "component identification should be considered more reliable for distinct features on the images , and should also become more robust as the time - density of epochs increases , because there are fewer consistent ways in which the components can be identified . for multi - epoch vlbi surveys then , the distribution of apparent speeds seems to be a robust and repeatable measurement ( witness the statistical agreement between the apparent speed distributions measured by the 2  cm survey and this paper , as discussed in @xmath2[appspeed ] ) , but we would caution against relying overly much on the apparent speed measured for a particular source , unless the component identification in that source is well constrained by having many more observed epochs than model components , or by seeing that particular component as a strong , distinct feature on the images .    whether or not two series of vlbi observations agree on their measurements of component motions is a separate question from whether or not those motions are a realistic portrayal of what is going on in the jet .",
    "comparison of vlba observations with simulations of relativistic jets by gomez ( 2005 ) led to the conclusion that the interpretation of vlbi images as a series of gaussian moving components is an overly simplistic idealization of more intricate jet emission patterns .",
    "some of the disagreements on ` component ' motions discussed above then probably arise from different approximations to an underlying complex flow that can not be fully resolved .",
    "however , because the vlbi data are only partially resolved , models consisting of a series of gaussians with a few free parameters do fit the observed visibilities with reasonable reduced chi - squareds , so unless the linear resolution of jet observations increases , it will be difficult to constrain fits to the more complex emission patterns suggested by the numerical simulations . despite these problems , the moving gaussian approximation does provide some valuable information about the sources . as shown here ,",
    "the apparent speed measurements in this approximation are repeatable for about 75% of the sources , and correlations between the measured apparent speeds and other source properties ( in , for example , the mojave survey [ lister 2006 ] ) have shown that the fastest measured apparent speeds in the gaussian approximation are a good realization of the bulk apparent speeds of the jets .",
    "some of the major conclusions from the present work are as follows :    1 . : :    the radio reference frame image database has been validated as    valuable tool for studying jet kinematics .",
    "all 8 ghz vlba images in    the rrfid for all 87 sources observed at 3 or more epochs over the    years 1994 - 1998 were considered , and in total we identified and    measured apparent speeds for 184 jet components in 77 of these    sources , with an average of 11 epochs of observation per source .",
    "about    half of these sources are not present in other large multi - epoch vlbi    surveys , so that these results represent the first information on the    jet kinematics in these sources .",
    "2 . : :    the measured apparent speed distribution for the 94 best - measured    components ( figure  4 ) shows a peak at low apparent speeds that is    consistent with a population of stationary components , a tail    extending out to apparent speeds of about @xmath0 , and a    mean apparent speed of 3.6@xmath1 .",
    "the distribution is    statistically consistent with the apparent speed distribution found by    the radio - selected 2  cm survey , but differs significantly from the    apparent speed distribution in gamma - ray blazars measured by jorstad    et al .",
    "3 . : :    for the 36 sources in common between this survey and the 2  cm survey ,    we made a component - by - component comparison of the measured apparent    speeds .",
    "significant disagreements are found in about 25% of the    apparent speed measurements , usually due to different assumed    component identification schemes .",
    "this first large - scale test of the    repeatability of apparent speed measurements shows that component    identification can be a significant problem that is probably best    avoided by short spacings between observing epochs .",
    "4 . : :    there is a difference between the fastest measured apparent speeds in    the quasars and bl lac objects , with the quasar jets being faster , but    the significance of this result is a rather low 94% . 5 . : :    we checked for accelerated radial motion and nonradial trajectories in    the individual component position data .",
    "we found significant nonradial    motion for six components , and report a tentative detection of    accelerated radial motion for three components .",
    ": :    there was no significant statistical difference in the apparent speed    distributions of the egret - detected and non - detected sources ; however ,    this survey does not contain a complete gamma - ray or radio - selected    sample .",
    "this paper has presented some of the first astrophysical results to be derived from the radio reference frame image database , and it is clear that this database can provide scientific results that compare favorably with those of other large vlbi surveys .",
    "however , we reiterate that the rrfid in not a complete flux - limited sample , and that the exact nature of the biases that this lack of pre - defined selection criteria may introduce into statistical quantities calculated from the rrfid is not known . this paper has only presented the apparent jet speed measurements made from the first five years of the rrfid ( 1994 - 1998 ) , with a minimal amount of further analysis .",
    "many more studies are possible with the current set of reduced rrfid data , and some of these will be pursued in future papers .",
    "such studies include a paper in preparation on the misalignment angles between the parsec and kiloparsec scale structures in the rrfid sources , and a future study of possible transverse jet structures .",
    "those studies will take advantage of the 2 ghz data present in the rrfid in addition to the 8 ghz data that was used in this paper , and will not be limited to the sources observed at three or more epochs that we have restricted ourselves to here .",
    "in addition , astrometric and geodetic vlba observations ( the rdv experiment series ) have continued at the rate of six epochs per year since the end of the rrfid data included in this paper in december 1998 .",
    "we are presently working as part of a collaborative effort to complete the imaging of the 30 rdv experiments observed during the years 1999 - 2003 , which will make the rrfid complete over a ten - year time baseline , with approximately 50 epochs per source for the best - observed sources .",
    "once the rrfid has been updated with a longer time baseline , we can update the apparent speed measurements given in this paper , significantly reducing the random errors .",
    "those updated apparent speeds can then be used for more detailed studies of jet physics , including studies of correlations with other source properties , radio source evolution and unification , and cosmology . with a long time baseline and dense epoch spacing providing up to 50 observed epochs per source , the continuation of the rrfid kinematic survey will continue to provide a valuable comparison to other active vlbi surveys such as the mojave and mojave - ii surveys .",

    "<S> this subset , referred to as the rrfid kinematic survey , comprises 966 images of 87 sources . </S>",
    "<S> the sources in this subset have an average of 11 epochs of observation over the years 1994 - 1998 , with the best - observed sources having 19 epochs . </S>",
    "<S> we have measured apparent speeds for a total of 184 jet components in 77 sources , of which the best - measured 94 component speeds in 54 sources are used in the final analysis . about half of the sources in the rrfid kinematic survey have not been previously studied with multi - epoch vlbi observations . </S>",
    "<S> a table containing all gaussian model components that were fit to the observed visibilities ( a total of 2579 model components ) is presented in machine - readable form .    </S>",
    "<S> the apparent speed distribution shows a peak at low apparent speeds ( consistent with stationary components ) , a tail extending out to apparent speeds of about @xmath0 , and a mean apparent speed of 3.6@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this apparent speed distribution is statistically consistent with the apparent speed distributions found by other radio - selected multi - epoch vlbi surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the fastest measured apparent speeds in the bl lac objects are slower than in the quasars , but at a relatively low confidence level of 94% . </S>",
    "<S> significant nonradial motion is found for six individual jet components , and a tentative detection of accelerated radial motion is reported for three individual components . </S>",
    "<S> there is no significant difference found between the fastest measured apparent speeds in the egret - detected and non - detected sources ; however , our samples of those populations are not complete .    a total of 36 of the sources in this paper are also included in the 2  cm vlba survey by kellermann et al . , with similar angular resolution , sensitivity , and time range . </S>",
    "<S> for those sources , we present a detailed component - by - component comparison of the apparent speeds measured by the 2  cm survey and those measured in this paper . many of the independent apparent speed measurements agree very well , but for approximately 25% of the components we find significant differences in the apparent speeds measured by the two surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the leading cause of these discrepancies are differences in how the two surveys have identified jet ` components ' from epoch - to - epoch , which is influenced by the different epoch spacings in the two surveys . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first such large - scale test of the repeatability of vlbi apparent speed measurements , and it has important implications for the interpretation of multi - epoch vlbi kinematic results . </S>"
