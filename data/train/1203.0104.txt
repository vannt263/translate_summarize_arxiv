    "recent advances in tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) in magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) with a single - crystal mgo barrier and bcc fe ferromagnetic electrodes make possible the fabrication of ultrahigh - speed and high - density magnetic random access memory(mram ) devices@xcite . in fe",
    "/ mgo / fe(001 ) mtjs , the crystal momentum parallel to the layer is conserved because of the 2-d periodicity of the system , and the tunneling conductance strongly depends on the symmetry of the propagating states in the bcc fe electrode because of the complex band structures of mgo , which causes a slow decay of the evanescent @xmath2 state in the barrier layer .",
    "furthermore , electrons with an in - plane wave vector @xmath4 ( normal incidence with respect to the plane ) dominate the tunneling , and bcc fe has a 100% spin polarization in the @xmath2 state at the fermi level .",
    "thus , fe / mgo / fe(001 ) mtjs act as spin filters for the current , yielding much larger tmr ratios of over 1000% in their ground state@xcite .",
    "achieving a high tunneling magnetoresistive ( tmr ) ratio in mgo - based mtjs requires epitaxial growth of the mgo layer with a correct crystalline orientation on ferromagnetic electrodes ( bcc fe and co@xmath5fe@xmath6 ) .",
    "however , it has been difficult to grow fe / mgo / fe(001 ) mtjs epitaxially owing to the relatively large lattice mismatch ( 5% ) between rock - salt - type mgo and bcc fe .",
    "recently , an off - stoichiometric , normal spinel mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 barrier was grown epitaxially on a single - crystal co@xmath0feal@xmath7si@xmath7 and bcc fe to explore new materials for the barrier layer of mtjs@xcite . since normal spinel mgal@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "has a lattice constant @xmath8 of 8.16 , the lattice mismatch with bcc - type ferromagnetic metals such as bcc fe and co - based full heusler alloys is very small , i.e. , less than 1% for a 45@xmath9 ( 001 ) in - plane rotation , indicating that mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 has the potential to overcome the problem associated with mgo barriers .",
    "in fact , a large room - temperature tmr ratio of over 100% was reported in co@xmath0feal@xmath7si@xmath7/mgal@xmath0o@xmath1/cofe(001 ) and fe / mgal@xmath0o@xmath1/fe(001 ) mtjs .",
    "furthermore , a relatively large bias voltage for one - half the zero - bias tmr ratio was obtained at room temperature ( rt ) , which is about twice that reported for mgo - based mtjs .",
    "the band structures of bulk mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 were investigated by first - principles density functional calculations@xcite , and the results were compared with experimental data from vacuum ultraviolet measurements@xcite .",
    "normal spinel mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 has an indirect band gap of about 7.8ev ( 6.5 ev in calculations ) , and the mg - o bond length ( 1.919 ) is shorter than that in mgo ( 2.102 ) , implying a stronger bond , and hence a larger band gap .",
    "however , the coherent tunneling properties of mtjs are still unknown for mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "in particular , it is necessary to elucidate the symmetry - dependent tunneling through the evanescent states of mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 and the physical cause of the relatively large tmr ratio obtained in recent experiments involving fe / mgal@xmath0o@xmath1/fe(001 ) mtjs@xcite .",
    "this work aims to determine the coherent tunneling properties of mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 and the cause of the large tmr ratios in fe / mgal@xmath0o@xmath1/fe(001 ) mtjs .",
    "to this end , we investigated the spin - dependent transport properties of fe / mgal@xmath0o@xmath1/fe(001 ) mtjs on the basis of first - principles density functional calculations of the electronic structures and the ballistic conductance .",
    "we prepared a super cell of a fe / mgal@xmath0o@xmath1/fe(001 ) mtj containing 11 atomic layers of bcc fe and 9 atomic layers of mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the in - plane lattice parameter of the super cell was fixed at 5.733 , which corresponds to twice the lattice constant of bcc fe ( 2.865 ) .",
    "since the lattice constant of spinel - type mgal@xmath0o@xmath0o is @xmath8=8.16 , the lattice mismatch between bcc fe and mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 for a 45@xmath9 ( 001 ) in - plane rotation is less than 1.0% .",
    "we performed first - principles calculations of the super cell using density functional theory within the generalized - gradient approximation for exchange - correlation energy@xcite . in order to facilitate structure optimization , which is important for determining the interface structure",
    ", we adopted plane - wave basis sets along with the ultrasoft pseudopotential method by using the quantum code espresso @xcite .",
    "the number of * k * points was taken to be 5@xmath105@xmath101 for all cases , and methfessel - paxton smearing with a broadening parameter of 0.01ry was used .",
    "the cutoff energies for the wavefunction and charge density were set to 30ry and 300ry , respectively .",
    "these values are large enough to deal with all the elements considered here within the ultrasoft pseudopotential method .    for the conductance calculations",
    ", we considered an open quantum system consisting of a scattering region having a mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 barrier and junctions with bcc fe attached to left and right semi - infinite electrodes corresponding to bulk bcc fe .",
    "the conductance was obtained by solving the scattering equation with infinite boundary conditions in which the wavefunction of the scattering region and its derivative were connected to the bloch states of each electrode@xcite . since our system",
    "is repeated periodically in the @xmath11 plane and propagating states can be assigned by an in - plane wave vector @xmath12 index , different @xmath3 do not mix and can be treated separately .",
    "furthermore , we neglected the spin - orbit interaction and noncollinear spin configuration .",
    "thus , we solved the scattering equations for some fixed @xmath3 and spin index on the basis of choi and ihm s approach @xcite .",

    "this results in two types of termination for fe / mgal@xmath0o@xmath1(001 ) junctions , namely , the a - site ( mg ) termination and b - site ( al - o ) termination . on the basis of formation energy calculations for optimized surface structures of mgal@xmath0o@xmath1(001 )",
    ", we found that b - site termination is thermodynamically more stable than a - site termination .",
    "this was also reported for other normal spinel compounds , such as fe@xmath13o@xmath1(001)@xcite .",
    "thus , we considered only b - site termination for the fe / mgal@xmath0o@xmath1(001 ) interface . in b - site termination , there are four possible configurations , with the fe atoms positioned on top of the al atoms ( al - top ) , al - al hollow , al - o hollow and the o atoms ( o - top ) of mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 . in order to determine the stable interfacial configuration at fe / mgal@xmath0o@xmath1(001 ) junctions , we minimized the total energy by relaxing all atomic positions except for those in the electrode region by changing the longitudinal size of the super cell .",
    "figure 1 shows schematics of the fe / mgal@xmath0o@xmath1/mgo(001 ) interfacial structure with b - site termination .",
    "we found that the o - top configuration is the most stable because of the hybridization between the 3@xmath14 orbital of fe and the @xmath15 orbital of o. therefore , in the present study on spin - dependent conductance and the tmr effect , we adopted the o - top configuration for the b - site terminated fe / mgal@xmath0o@xmath1(001 ) interface .",
    "figure 2 shows the local density of states ( ldos ) of fe in mgal@xmath0o@xmath1/fe(001 ) , mgo / fe(001 ) and the bulk region .",
    "the interfacial ldos of fe at the interface with mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 are modified from those in the bulk region , owing to the appearance of the nonbonding fe-3@xmath16 and fe-3@xmath17 states around the fermi level .",
    "the spin moment of interfacial fe is 3.08@xmath18 , which is larger than that in the bulk region ( 2.49@xmath18 ) .",
    "similar results have been obtained for mgo / fe(001 ) interfaces@xcite .",

    "we confirmed in fig .",
    "3(a ) that the majority - spin conductance for the parallel magnetization has a broad peak around the center of the 2-d brillouin zone .",
    "this is the typical behavior of the coherent tunneling conductance of @xmath2 electrons at @xmath20=(0,0 ) .",
    "furthermore , we found in fig .",
    "3(b ) that the minority - spin conductance for the parallel magnetization also shows a broad peak at @xmath20=(0,0 ) .",
    "this result is very different from that for the fe / mgo / fe(001 ) mtj@xcite , where the @xmath20-dependence of the minority - spin conductance for the parallel magnetization shows hotspot - like peaked structures in the 2-d brillouin zone with no peak at @xmath20=(0,0 ) because of the absence of the @xmath2 band around the fermi level .",
    "since the tunneling conductance in the anti - parallel magnetization shows a combination of the features observed in the majority and minority spin channels , we obtained a broad peak at @xmath20=(0,0 ) in the @xmath20 dependence of the conductance for the anti - parallel magnetization as shown in fig .",

    "the positions of the fermi level in the band gap were determined from the ldos of oxygen atoms in the center of the barrier layer of fe / mgal@xmath0o@xmath1/fe(001 ) and fe / mgo / fe(001 ) mtjs . since propagating states in the metal electrode couple to evanescent states ( @xmath25 ) in the barrier layer and decay as @xmath26 , the evanescent state with the smallest decay parameter , @xmath27 , makes the largest contribution to the tunneling conductance in mtjs .",
    "we found that at ( @xmath21,@xmath22)=(0,0 ) , mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 has the smallest @xmath24 with @xmath2 symmetry in the gap connecting the top of the @xmath2 valence band to the bottom of the @xmath2 conduction band , which is similar to the case for rock - salt - type mgo .",
    "this could be due to the hybridization between o 2@xmath15 and mg 2@xmath15 , generating the energy gap along the @xmath28 line .",
    "furthermore , the lowest @xmath24 of mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 showed a @xmath29 dependence similar to that for mgo .",

    "these results are inconsistent with our calculation results , where the tmr ratio of the fe / mgal@xmath0o@xmath1/fe(001 ) mtj ( 160% ) was one order of magnitude smaller than that of the fe / mgo / fe(001 ) mtj ( 1600% ) .     as a function of real @xmath21 at the fermi levels for bulk mgo and mgal@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
