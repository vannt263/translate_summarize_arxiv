    "imagine a large chessboard , such as occasionally found in a park .",
    "it is fall , and all the master players have fled the cold a long time ago .",
    "you are taking a walk and enjoy the beautiful sunny afternoon , all the colors of the indian summer in the trees and in the falling leaves around you .",
    "looking at the chessboard , you see that some squares are already full of leaves , while others are still empty @xcite .",
    "the pattern of the squares which are covered by leaves seems rather random . as you try to cross the chessboard",
    ", you see that there is a way to get from one side of the board to the opposite side by walking on leaf - covered squares only .",
    "this is percolation  nearly .    before continuing and explaining in detail",
    "what percolation is about , let me outline the content of this paper . in sect .",
    "[ sec : percolation ] , i will review some of the most prominent and interesting results on classical percolation .",
    "percolation theory is at the heart of many phenomena in statistical physics that are also topics in this book . beyond the exact solutions of percolation in @xmath0 and @xmath1 dimensions , further exact solutions in @xmath2 only rarely exist .",
    "thus computational methods , using high - performance computers and algorithms are needed for further progress and in sects .",
    "[ sec : color ]  [ sec : gradient ] , i explain in detail some of these algorithms",
    ". section [ sec : renormalization ] is devoted to the real - space renormalization group ( rg ) approach to percolation .",
    "this provides an independent and very suggestive method of analytically computing results for the percolation problem as well as a further numerical algorithm .    while many applications of percolation theory are mainly concerned with problems of classical statistical physics , i will show in sect.[sec : qhe ] that the percolation approach can give useful information also at the quantum scale .",
    "in particular , i will show that aspects of the quantum hall ( qh ) effect can be understood by a suitably generalized renormalization procedure of bond percolation in @xmath3 .",
    "this application allows the computation of critical exponents and conductance distributions at the qh transition and also opens the way for studies of scale - invariant , experimentally relevant macroscopic inhomogeneities .",
    "i summarize in sect .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "from the chessboard example given above , we realize that the percolation problem deals with the spatial _ connectivity _ of occupied squares instead of simply counting whether the number of such squares has the majority of all squares .",
    "then the obvious question to ask is : how many leaves are usually needed in order to allow passage across the board ? since leaves normally do not interact with each other , and friction - related forces can be assumed small compared to wind forces , we can model the situation by assuming that the leaves are _ randomly _ distributed on the board",
    ". then we can define an occupation probability @xmath4 as being the probability that a site is occupied ( by at least one leaf ) .",
    "thus our question can be rephrased in modern physics terminology as : is there a threshold value @xmath5 at which there is a spanning cluster of occupied sites across an infinite lattice ?",
    "the first time this question was asked and the term _ percolation _ used was in the year 1957 in publications of broadbent and hammersley @xcite . since",
    "then a multitude of research articles , reviews and books have appeared on this subject .",
    "certainly among the most readable such publications is the 1995 book by stauffer and aharony @xcite , where also most of the relevant research articles have been cited .",
    "let me here briefly summarize some of the highlights that have been discovered in the nearly 50 years of research on percolation .",
    "the percolation problem in @xmath0 can be solved exactly .",
    "since the number of empty sites in a chain of length @xmath6 is @xmath7 , there is always a finite probability for finding such an empty site in the infinite cluster at @xmath8 and thus the percolation threshold is @xmath9 . defining a correlation function @xmath10 which measures the probability that a site at distance @xmath11 from an occupied site at @xmath12 belongs to the same cluster",
    ", we easily find @xmath13 and thus @xmath14 .",
    "thus close to the percolation threshold , the correlation length @xmath15 diverges with an exponent @xmath16 .    in @xmath3 ,",
    "the percolation problem provides perhaps the simplest example of a second - order phase transition .",
    "the order parameter of this transition is the probability @xmath17 that an arbitrary site in the infinite lattice is part of an infinite cluster @xcite , i.e. , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a critical exponent similar to the exponent @xmath20 of the correlation length . the distribution of the sites in an infinite cluster at the percolation threshold can be described as a fractal @xcite , i.e. , its average size @xmath21 in boxes of length @xmath22 increases as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the fractal dimension of the cluster . as in any second - order phase transition ,",
    "much insight can be gained by a finite - size scaling analysis @xcite .",
    "in particular , the exponents introduced above are related according to the scaling relation @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown to an astonishing degree of accuracy , that the values of the exponents and the relations between them are independent of the type of lattice considered , i.e. , square , triangular , honeycomb , etc . , and also whether the percolation problem is defined for sites or bonds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : perco - site - bond ] ) .",
    "this independence is called _ universality_. in the following , we will see that the universality does not apply for the percolation threshold @xmath5 .",
    "thus it is of importance to note that @xmath5 for site percolation on the triangular lattice and bond percolation on the square lattice is known exactly : @xmath26 .",
    "especially the bond percolation problem has received much attention also by mathematicians @xcite .",
    "clusters in each panel .",
    "the solid outline indicates the percolating cluster , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    for higher dimensions , much of this picture remains unchanged , although the values of @xmath5 _ and _ the critical exponents change .",
    "the upper critical dimension corresponds to @xmath27 such that mean field theory is valid for @xmath28 with exponents as given in table [ tab : critexp ] .",
    ".[tab : critexp ] critical exponents @xmath20 and @xmath19 and fractal dimension @xmath24 for different spatial dimensions . for a more complete list",
    "see @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as explained for the bond percolation problem we now apply the rg method to the cc model .",
    "the rg structure which builds the new super - saddle points is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : rg - struct ] .",
    "it consists of @xmath29 saddle points drawn as bonds .",
    "the links ( and phase factors ) connecting the saddle points are indicated by arrows pointing in the direction of the electron motion due to the magnetic field .",
    "each saddle point acts as a scatterer connecting the @xmath30 incoming @xmath31 with the @xmath30 outgoing channels @xmath32 @xmath33 with reflection coefficients @xmath34 and transmission coefficients @xmath35 , which are assumed to be real numbers .",
    "the complex phase factors enter later via the links between the saddle points . by this definition  including the minus sign  the unitarity constraint @xmath36 is fulfilled a priori .",
    "the amplitude of transmission of the incoming electron to another equipotential line and the amplitude of reflection and thus staying on the same equipotential line add up to unity ",
    "electrons do not get lost .    in order to obtain the scattering equation of the super - saddle point we now need to connect the @xmath29 scattering equations according to fig.[fig : rg - struct ] . for each link",
    "the amplitude of the incoming channels is defined by the amplitude of the outgoing channel of the previous saddle point multiplied by the corresponding complex phase factor @xmath37 .",
    "this results in a system of @xmath29 matrix equations , which has to be solved .",
    "one obtains an rg equation for the transmission coefficient @xmath38 of the super - saddle point @xcite analogously to eq .",
    "( [ eq : bond - rg ] ) , @xmath39 depending on the products @xmath40 , @xmath41 of transmission and reflection coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath34 of the @xmath42 saddle points and the @xmath43 random phases @xmath44 accumulated along equipotentials in the original lattice . for",
    "further algebraic simplification one can apply a useful transformation of the amplitudes @xmath45 and @xmath46 to heights @xmath47 relative to heights @xmath48 of the saddle points .",
    "the conductance @xmath49 is connected to the transmission coefficient @xmath50 by @xmath51 @xcite .      for the numerical determination of the conductance distribution , we first choose an initial probability distribution @xmath52 of transmission coefficients @xmath50 .",
    "the distribution is discretized in at least @xmath53 bins .",
    "thus the bin width is typically @xmath54 for the interval @xmath55 $ ] .    using the initial distribution @xmath56",
    ", we now randomly select many different transmission coefficients and insert them into the rg equation ( [ eq - qhrg ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the phases @xmath57 , @xmath58 are also chosen randomly , but according to a uniform distribution @xmath59 $ ] . by this method",
    "at least @xmath60 super - transmission coefficients @xmath38 are calculated and their distribution @xmath61 is stored .",
    "next , @xmath62 is averaged using a savitzky - golay smoothing filter @xcite in order to decrease statistical fluctuations .",
    "this process is then repeated using @xmath62 as the new initial distribution .     by three gaussians .",
    "inset : moments of the fp distribution @xmath63 .",
    "the dashed lines indicate various predictions based on extrapolations of results for small @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the dotted line denotes the moments of a constant distribution , scaledwidth=72.0% ]    the iteration process is stopped when the distribution @xmath65 is no longer distinguishable from its predecessor @xmath66 and we have reached the desired fixed - point ( fp ) distribution @xmath67 .",
    "however , due to numerical instabilities , small deviations from symmetry add up such that typically after @xmath68@xmath69 iterations the distributions become unstable and converge towards the classical fps of no transmission or complete transmission similar to the classical percolation case .",
    "figure [ fig : rg - conductance ] shows this behavior for one of the rg iterations .",
    "the fp distribution @xmath63 shows a flat minimum around @xmath70 and sharp peaks at @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "it is symmetric with @xmath73 .",
    "this is in agreement with previous theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite results whereas our results contain much less statistical fluctuations .",
    "furthermore we determine moments @xmath74 of the fp distribution @xmath63 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rg - conductance ] for small moments up to @xmath75 our results agree with the work of wang et al .",
    "@xcite , who computed moments @xmath76 .",
    "but more interesting is the fact that the obtained moments of the fp distribution can hardly be distinguished from the moments of a simple constant distribution thus indicating the influence of the broad flat minimum of the fp distribution around @xmath70 .    for the determination of the critical exponent , we next perturb the fp distribution slightly ,",
    "i.e. , we construct a distribution with shifted average @xmath77 .",
    "then we perform an rg iteration and compute the new average @xmath78 of @xmath79 . tracing the shift of the perturbed average @xmath80 for several initial shifts",
    "@xmath77 , we expect to find a linear dependence of @xmath80 on @xmath77 for each iteration step @xmath81 .",
    "the critical exponent is then related to the slope @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : rg - nu - l ] shows the resulting @xmath20 in dependence on the iteration step and thus system size .",
    "the curve converges close to @xmath83 , i.e.  the value obtained by lee et al.@xcite .",
    "note that the system size \" is more properly called a system magnification , since we start the rg iteration with an fp distribution valid for an infinite system and then magnify the system in the course of the iteration by a factor @xmath84 .",
    "as a function of magnification factor @xmath84 for rg step @xmath81 .",
    "the dashed line shows the expected result @xmath85 .",

    "the dashed lines indicate linear fits to the data , scaledwidth=72.0% ]",
    "the percolation model represents the perhaps simplest example of a system exhibiting complex behavior although its constituents  the sites and bonds  are chosen completely uncorrelated .",
    "of course , the complexity enters through the connectivity requirement for percolating clusters .",
    "i have reviewed several numerical algorithms for quantitatively measuring various aspects of the percolation problem .",
    "the specific choice reflects purely my personal preferences and i am happy to note that other algorithms such as breadth- and depth - first algorithms @xcite have been introduced by p.  grassberger in his contribution @xcite .",
    "the real - space rg provides an instructive use of the underlying self - similarity of the percolation model at the transition .",
    "furthermore , it can be used to study very large effective system sizes .",
    "this is needed in many applications . as an example",
