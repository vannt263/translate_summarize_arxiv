    "before proceeding further , we briefly underline the methodology relating the elements of the mass matrices to those of the mixing matrix . in the flavor basis , wherein the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath7 is diagonal , the majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath8 can be expressed in terms of three neutrino masses @xmath9,@xmath10 , @xmath11 and the flavor mixing matrix v as @xmath12 the mixing matrix v can be written as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa sakata ( pmns ) @xcite neutrino mixing matrix consisting of three flavor mixing angles and one dirac - like cp violating phase , whereas , the matrix @xmath15 is a diagonal phase matrix , i.e. , @xmath15=diag(@xmath16 ) with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being the two majorana cp violating phases .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix @xmath8 can then be rewritten as @xmath17 + where @xmath18    for the purpose of calculations , we have adopted the parameterization of the mixing matrix @xmath14 considered by ref .",
    "@xcite , e.g. , @xmath19 + where @xmath20 for i , j=1,2,3 and @xmath1 is the cp violating phase .",
    "before discussing the results of the analysis , we summarize the experimental information about various neutrino oscillation parameters . for both normal mass ordering ( no ) and inverted mass ordering ( io ) , the best fit values and the latest experimental constraints on neutrino parameters at 1@xmath3 , 2@xmath3 and 3@xmath3 confidence level ( cl ) , following ref .",
    "@xcite , are given in table ( [ data ] ) .    .[data]1@xmath3",
    ", 2@xmath3 and 3@xmath3 cl ranges of neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "no ( io ) refers to normal ( inverted ) neutrino mass ordering . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to this end , in table 3.3 we have summarized the allowed ranges of dirac - like cp violating phase @xmath1 , the majorana phases @xmath6 and three neutrino masses @xmath21 for the experimentally allowed classes .",
    "a few interesting points are as follows :    * as is obvious from the table , the matrices belonging to class a are ruled out for io , whereas for no , although both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are compatible , however , one is not able to obtain any useful constraints for either of the cp violating phases . *",
    "all the matrices belonging to class b are viable for both no and io . for both the mass orderings , phase @xmath1 takes values close to @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the majorana phases @xmath2 and @xmath3 are both quite small , in particular for io these take values smaller to the corresponding values for no . for no",
    ", these conclusions have already been shown graphically in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3](a ) , ( b ) .",
    "the corresponding graphs pertaining to io are similar and hence not shown here .",
    "* again the matrix belonging to class c is viable for both no and io . unlike the matrices of class b , now one finds significantly different constraints on cp violating phase @xmath1 for no and io . in particular , for no , @xmath1 takes values from @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "however for io , the lower limit of @xmath1 becomes considerable higher , in particular @xmath1 takes values from @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "further , regarding the majorana phases , for no , the phases @xmath3 as well as @xmath2 lie between @xmath32 to @xmath33 and @xmath34 . however , for io , although phase @xmath3 remains unconstrained , the phase @xmath2 gets considerably constrained to @xmath35 .",
    "+ for no , these conclusions have already been shown graphically in figs .",
    "[ figc ] and [ figcphases](a ) , ( b ) . for io , mixing angle @xmath0 versus phase @xmath1 graph is shown in fig .",
    "[ figcio ] . from the graph",
    ", one finds that corresponding to the 3@xmath3 cl experimental range of angle @xmath0 i.e. @xmath36 to @xmath37 , one obtains a slight constraint on phase @xmath1 , in particular it largely lies between @xmath38 .",
    "+ : mixing angle @xmath0 versus phase @xmath1 for io .",
    "all the parameters are in degrees . ] + again for io , in fig . [",
    "figcphasesio](a ) and ( b ) , we have shown the correlation plots of dirac - like cp violating phase @xmath1 and majorana phases phases @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , we find that although for phase @xmath3 we do not obtain any useful constraint , i.e. , it takes values from @xmath39 , however , phase @xmath2 gets narrowed down considerably , i.e. , it lies between @xmath40 .",
    "also , one finds that phase @xmath2 shows considerable dependence on dirac - like cp violating phase @xmath1 .",
    "to summarize , in the light of recent refinements of mixing angle @xmath0 , we have re - investigated all the possible texture structures of three zero and two zero neutrino mass matrices for both majorana and dirac neutrinos in the flavor basis . in particular , we have examined implications of angle @xmath0 on the parameter space of three cp violating phases @xmath6 , @xmath1 . for the case of texture three zero mass matrices , in confirmation with the earlier results , we find that all possible structures remain ruled out even with the recent data . for a particular texture structure , this has been shown using correlation plots between angles @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the constraints obtained from real and imaginary parts of ratios of complex neutrino mass eigenvalues .",
    "these graphs show that @xmath4 obtained here has no overlap with its experimental range , therefore , ruling out the present texture specific case .    for the case of texture two zero mass matrices , out of the 15 possible structures , the matrices belonging to classes d ,",
    "e and f remain ruled out even with the latest data . for the classes a , b and c ,",
    "analysis has been carried out for both no and io .",
    "the analysis shows that the matrices of class a are ruled out for io , whereas , for no , one does not obtain any useful constraints on the cp violating phases . for the class b matrices , all these are viable for both no and io . for both the mass orderings , phase @xmath1 takes values close to @xmath24 and @xmath25 , however , the majorana phases @xmath2 and @xmath3 both acquire quite small values .",
    "the matrix belonging to class c is again viable for both no and io . for no , phase @xmath1 has lower limit @xmath41 , whereas , for io the lower limit is @xmath42 .",
    "the majorana phases also acquire different constraints for different mass orderings .",
