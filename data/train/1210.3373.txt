    "for the first time since the discovery of the top quark in the 1990s , a new fundamental particle has been discovered .",
    "data from both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite , collected during the 2011 and 2012 lhc runs indicates the presence of a new neutral boson with mass around 126 gev and whose properties are strongly suggestive of the long - sought standard model ( sm ) higgs boson . to establish this identification , it is vital to measure the couplings of this resonance to the rest of the sm particles .",
    "the lhc experiments have already made remarkable progress on this front , with published measurements of the branching ratios to gauge bosons , as well as to taus .",
    "in fact , a number of theoretical attempts to process the relatively limited number of experimental results into determinations of couplings have recently appeared @xcite .",
    "one sector that is particularly challenging to establish are the couplings of the light quarks ( up , down , and strange ) .",
    "indeed , in the sm , these couplings are all very tiny , leading to no expected visible phenomena at colliders .",
    "in addition , light quarks manifest as  unflavored \" jets of hadrons in detectors , and are very difficult to distinguish from each other as well as from gluons .",
    "if the newly discovered resonance is not precisely the sm higgs , one could imagine that ( with some coincidences such that the rate works out to be approximately sm - like ) it is actually being produced by some combination of the light quarks in addition to by gluon fusion . while perhaps not the most likely scenario , it is worthwhile to explore how we can be sure that such a coincidence is not obscuring our understanding of the new resonance .",
    "excluding the more exotic possibilities is an important step which is necessary to put the detailed program of measuring the higgs couplings in the framework of more aggressive assumptions ( such as the studies mentioned above ) on more solid footing .",
    "we choose to focus our attention on the coupling to the strange ( @xmath3 ) quark .",
    "this is not because the strange is particularly more likely to be responsible for the kind of conspiracy that we have in mind than the up ( @xmath4 ) or down ( @xmath5 ) quarks .",
    "rather , the strange quark is an interesting proxy for any light quark s coupling to the new resonance , and since the strange has somewhat smaller , sea parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) whose shape is more reminiscent of the gluon than the valence @xmath4 or @xmath5 quarks , it would be more likely to exploit kinematic degeneracy with production by gluon fusion .",
    "finally , the strange quark is expected in the sm to couple more strongly to the higgs by about an order of magnitude compared to @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "thus , if there is something peculiar about the light quark couplings , it _ could _",
    "reasonably reveal itself more readily in the strange coupling .    a much enhanced coupling to strange leads to several modifications to the properties of a higgs - like particle .",
    "first , it opens a new contribution to the ( typically unobservable at the lhc @xcite ) decay mode into jets which if sufficiently enhanced can compete with other interesting decays , such as into photons or weak bosons . just as it has been noted that a sm higgs of mass 125 gev provides many interesting decay modes of comparable branching fraction to study , a new or subtly modified decay mode can more effectively hide at such a mass since several precise measurements are required to account for all of the decay modes .",
    "second , it enhances the production of the boson through strange quark fusion , which is expected to be negligible in the case of the sm higgs . if the coupling to gluons is also modified commensurately , it may be that the rate of production alone does not provide enough information to isolate the two couplings .",
    "we will allow for both couplings to gluon and to the strange quark to vary , in order to explore how rigorously one can determine both couplings in light of this potential degeneracy .",
    "some interesting studies in a similar spirit ( but asking different questions ) can be found in refs .  @xcite .",
    "we study an effective field theory consisting of the sm fermions and vector bosons , and the newly observed resonance , which we denote as @xmath6 .",
    "it is very useful to contrast the couplings of @xmath6 with those of the sm higgs at the same mass , which we denote as @xmath7 .",
    "we begin by reviewing the sm @xmath7 couplings to quarks and gluons ( which is completely dominated in the sm by the contribution from the top loop ) .",
    "the sm quark interactions with higgs are given by , _",
    "q|qh & = & -   _ q  |q q h , where @xmath8 is the quark mass and @xmath9  gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "these couplings generate an effective coupling to gluons of the form @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the strong coupling , @xmath12 is the gluon field strength tensor , and the factor @xmath13 is , @xmath14 in the heavy quark mass limit @xmath15 ( which is a good approximation for @xmath16  gev compared to the top quark of mass @xmath17  gev ) we have @xmath18 , and the effective coupling in the sm @xmath19",
    ". it will be useful for later convenience to note that for the quark masses @xmath20 mev , @xmath21 gev , and @xmath22 gev , we have @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "we parameterize the @xmath6 couplings relative to their sm counter - parts via parameters @xmath26 , where we are particularly interested in @xmath27 .",
    "the strange and top quark couplings , we write as : _",
    "s|s & = & -_s   |s s [ eq : ssh_coupling ]  , + _ t|t & = & -_t    |t t  . similarly , the coupling to gluons is written as , @xmath28 because the gluon coupling results primarily from a top loop , there is in general a connection between @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in principle , for very large values of @xmath31 , it may also contribute , as will any exotic colored particle with substantial coupling to the higgs . in the absence of such colored particles and for @xmath32",
    ", one arrives at the relationship @xmath33 .",
    "we derive results both assuming this relationship holds , and also for the case @xmath30 is fixed to one , and allowing @xmath29 to vary independently .",
    "though not of foremost interest here , large enhancements of @xmath30 will also be reflected in an enhancement of the associated production of @xmath6 with a pair of top quarks .",
    "a recent cms search for associated production @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 ) finds an upper limit on this process of 8.5 times the sm expectation at @xmath1 confidence level ( cl ) @xcite . assuming a standard br into @xmath36 , this requires @xmath37 .",

    "modifications to the coupling to strange quarks and/or gluons also implies that the production rate will be modified .",

    "observation of the decay into diphotons provides powerful information about @xmath31 : for @xmath63 , at @xmath89 the data requires @xmath93 and at @xmath90 , @xmath94 .",
    "somewhat counter - intuitively , a smaller value for the diphoton ratio permits _ larger _ modifications of the strange coupling to the higgs .",
    "we can safely rule out the possibility that the observed higgs - like state is being produced solely by strange fusion as opposed to gluon fusion .",
    "going beyond the inclusive rate , one can imagine that more exclusive measurements could shed light on the @xmath31-@xmath29 degeneracy .",
    "for example , the rate of additional hard jet radiation should be larger for gluon - initiated processes than for quarks , and the balance of flavor content will likewise be different .",

    ", width=8 ]    a simple inclusive feature that one can exploit is the fact that the lhc provides data at multiple collider energies , and look at the inclusive rate and how it changes with energy . because the strange and gluon pdfs have slightly different slopes , the production rates for each case exhibit a small difference in their energy dependence .",
    "unfortunately , the dependence turns out to be rather weak . if one defines the difference between two hypotheses for @xmath31 to be @xmath98 , @xmath99 where the subscript @xmath100 refers to the relative difference between the cross section at @xmath101 with that for which @xmath95 . in figure",

    "in this article , we have examined the dependence on the inferred properties of the newly discovered boson with mass around 125 gev on assumptions concerning its coupling to the strange quark .",
    "somewhat counter - intuitively , we find that the largest impact of an enhanced strange coupling is to increase the total width , and thus depress the branching ratio into @xmath64 . as a result",
    ", a measurement of the diphoton rate which is enhanced compared to the sm expectation actually provides a stricter upper bound on the strange coupling than a rate which is more consistent with the sm expectation .",
    "we find that the current observation of decays into diphotons at an enhanced rate places a rather strong bound that the strange coupling be enhanced by no more than @xmath105 at the @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) level , if one assumes @xmath2 modification to the coupling to gluons .",
    "a rate into diphotons which was closer to the sm expectation would have resulted in a weaker bound .",
    "we examined the energy dependence of the diphoton cross section , and found that the energy dependence of scenarios which saturate the @xmath31 limit is typically too small to resolve given the intrinsic theoretical uncertainties .",
    "as we unravel the properties of the newly discovered boson , it may well turn out to be consistent with a vanilla , sm higgs .",
    "however , it is important to explore alternatives , even those that may seem unlikely , in order to avoid the pitfall of scenarios that look superficially sm - like , but are in fact exotic . in the current work",
    ", we found , somewhat to our surprise , that there is not a large slop in the strange quark couplings to the higgs , and one can place a relatively strong bound given some mild assumptions .",
