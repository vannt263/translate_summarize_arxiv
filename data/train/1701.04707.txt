    "the theory that describes the fundamental interaction between quarks and gluons is called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "ever since its formulation people have speculated on the qcd phase diagram .",
    "qcd is constructed as a non abelian gauge theory and posses two most astonishing features : asymptotic freedom @xcite and a global symmetry ( chiral symmetry ) that is spontaneously broken at small temperatures and net baryon number densities @xcite .",
    "these are the principles that not only guide our thinking of the spectrum of qcd bound states in vacuum , but give also rise to a rich and fascinating phase structure of qcd .",
    "even before the fundamental properties of qcd had been fully revealed , it was realized that the spectrum of hadronic resonances that becomes exponentially dense at high energies , would naturally lead to the concept of a limiting temperature in a gas of hadrons @xcite .",
    "later on , with the analysis of the running qcd coupling that due to asymptotic freedom vanishes in the high energy limit , it was quickly understood that hadronic matter undergoes a transition to a new state of matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite . at low temperatures and net baryon number densities the coupling constant is so large , that quarks are tightly bound into hadrons",
    "the static quark potential is in fact linear rising with distance , thus quarks are confined into hadrons .",
    "however , once the density of hadrons increases coursed by thermal fluctuations or a large baryon chemical potential , they start to overlap and the potential gets screened .",
    "hence , the quarks get liberated and are allowed to move over macroscopic distances @xcite .    it was also speculated that the deconfinement transition of qcd goes along with the global restoration of chiral symmetry , that is manifest in the qcd lagrangian @xcite .",
    "based on the symmetries of qcd many effective models have been designed and analyzed at non zero temperature and baryon number density , which greatly enhanced our understanding of the qcd phase diagram . from these model calculations a complex phase structure with various homogeneous as well as in - homogeneous phases",
    "has emerged @xcite . at very high net - quark number densities ,",
    "several different pairing mechanisms among quarks have been proposed , that would lead to various color super - conducting phases , similar to electrical super - conductors in condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , details of those phases are highly model dependent and could so far not be addressed with first principle qcd calculations . for this reason we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdiag ] a simplified version of the qcd phase diagram that mainly features a speculative critical point , that appears as a critical end - point ( cep ) of a line of first order transitions .",
    "this cep is currently subject to many lattice qcd calculations as well as experimental heavy ion programs .",
    ", scaledwidth=42.5%,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the framework of lattice regularized qcd provides a non perturbative method , which has proven to be very successful since its inception @xcite . as the qcd coupling constant is rather large at temperatures close to the qcd transition @xcite and since it is running logarithmically",
    ", it becomes small only at exponentially high energy scales .",
    "this is the reason why ordinary perturbation theory is expected to be reliable only at very high temperatures and net baryon number densities .",
    "using appropriate re - summation schemes , as hard thermal loop ( htl ) perturbation theory @xcite or electric qcd ( eqcd ) @xcite the range of validity can be extended down to a few times the transition temperature ( @xmath0 ) . however , close to @xmath0 qcd is deeply non perturbative . here",
    "lattice qcd is the only known method that  after a proper continuum extrapolation  can address the thermodynamics of quarks and gluons .",
    "this is definitely true for the case of a vanishing net baryon number , or equivalently , a vanishing baryon chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) . at non zero chemical potential ,",
    "lattice qcd suffers from the infamous sign problem . at small @xmath1 ,",
    "however , this problem can be overcome by a taylor expansion in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "other methods that have the potential to solve the sign problem completely are currently being developed @xcite .    at the same time , huge experimental effort is undertaken to create and measure the thermal properties of qgp . shortly after the formation of man - made qgp matter in a heavy ion experiment",
    "was first announced at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) at cern @xcite , the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl went in operation . at rhic",
    "the envisaged goal was exactly to crate and study qgp .",
    "also at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) a dedicated heavy ion program is conducted .",
    "related to the dynamical expansion of the qgp medium , after its creation in the central collision region of two heavy nuclei , rhic discovered a few very remarkable transport properties of qgp .",
    "based on the observation of elliptic flow and jet quenching effects , it is believed that in a short temperature range directly above @xmath0 , the qgp behaves as an almost perfect fluid , with a small shear viscosity and small transport coefficients such as electrical conductivity and diffusion coefficients .",
    "it is tempting to study those transport properties also on the lattice , which will provide crucial input to the modeling of the expansion of the qgp .",
    "more recently , rhic initiated a beam energy scan program ( bes ) aiming on the exploration of the qcd phase diagram and the discovery of the postulated cep .",
    "reducing the bombarding energy of the collision , leads to a variation of the initial conditions at which the qgp is created .",
    "lower bombarding energies translate into colder but more dense systems at formation times . with the planed future facilities fair and nica ,",
    "one wants to increase the density even further .",
    "approximate initial conditions of various heavy ion experiments are sketched in fig .",

    "the discretization that has been performed in order to perform the mc integration eq .",

    "the most obvious is certainly the introduction of discretization errors of the action functionals .",
    "the gauge action as given in eq .",

    "these discretization errors can be systematically removed by adding additional terms to the gauge action that are composed of wilson loops of length greater than that of the plaquette @xcite .",

    "such a symanzik improved gauge action is correct up to correction of order @xmath56 .    with in the fermionic sector",
    "the problems are more severe . here",
    "the naive nearest - neighbor discretization of the covariant derivative in the dirac operator not only introduces discretization errors of order @xmath57 it also gives rise to unphysical degrees of freedom .",
    "this is due to the fact that a finite lattice spacing introduces a cut - off in momentum space and thus a periodicity in the lattice dispersion relation .",
    "the fermion modes that are associated with the roots of the dispersion relation in the @xmath58 corners of the brillouin zone are known as fermion doublers . moreover ,",
    "the fermion doublers are intimately connected with the explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry on the lattice @xcite .",
    "several discretization schemes have been invented to deal with these problems . among them",
    "are wilson @xcite and staggered @xcite fermions which are most commonly used due to their moderate computational costs , but also domain wall @xcite and overlap @xcite fermions .    in lattice calculations at nonzero temperature ,",
    "the consequences of the chosen fermion discretization scheme are three - fold . for a study of universal critical behavior that arises due to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry of qcd ,",
    "it is most important to use an action that possess at least a remnant of this symmetry .",
    "the situation here is the following : the wilson action breaks the chiral symmetry completely at any finite lattice spacing .",
    "the staggered action preserves a @xmath59 subgroup of the symmetry , _ i.e. _ the fermion fields on even and odd sides can be multiplied separately by a phase .",
    "domain - wall fermions are chiral in the limit of a large fifth dimension and overlap fermions posses an exact ( albeit modified ) chiral symmetry at any finite lattice spacing .",
    "the latter two action are so costly that so far no scaling study close to the chiral limit has been possible .",
    "first studies of the transition temperature @xcite , thermodynamic quantities @xcite and the anomalously broken axial symmetry @xmath60 and the dirac spectrum @xcite have , however , been performed recently .    for studies of bulk thermodynamic quantities such as the pressure @xmath61 and the energy density @xmath62 the high and the low temperature regimes suffer from two different types of discretization errors . at very high temperatures , deviations from the stefan - boltzmann ( sb )",
    "limit stem from the discretization errors of the covariant derivative .",

    "it is interesting to note that even though the standard wilson action features cutoff errors of @xmath57 , corrections to bulk thermodynamic quantities are universal to standard wilson and standard staggered actions and start at @xmath55 . to summarize , an expansion of the dimensionless quantity @xmath63 around the ideal gas limit yields @xcite @xmath64    at low temperatures , bulk thermodynamic quantities are",
    ", as we will see , mainly determined by the hadronic spectrum of qcd .",
    "due to the existence of fermion doublers on the lattice  also called fermion tastes ",
    "the hadronic states are duplicated as well .",
    "moreover , high energy gluons that scatter fermions from one corner of the brillouin zone to another , introduce a nontrivial interaction between different fermion tastes , which leads to the so called taste splitting of hadronic states .",
    "this splitting is most prominent in the light pion sector . within the staggered fermions formulations ,",
    "the doublers are reduced from 16 to 4 tastes .",
    "consequently , with these 4 tastes many more ( 15 ) pions can be formed , which become degenerated only in the continuum limit . in order to suppress large momentum modes of the gluons and thus reduce the taste splitting ,",
    "smeared gauge fields are used in the dirac operator .",
    "popular staggered type actions are the 2stout and 4stout actions , that use 2 and 4 levels of stout - smearing @xcite , respectively as well as the hisq ( highly improved staggered quark ) action @xcite .",
    "the latter combines two levels of 5- and 7-link smearing with the naik - term that also improves the high - t limit of this action . in terms of taste splitting , which can be measures , _",
    "e.g. _ , by the root - mean - square mass @xmath65 of the pions , it is found that the 4stout actions performs similarly well as the hisq action .",
    "having understood the leading correction in the lattice spacing @xmath10 , we eventually extrapolate to the continuum limit ( @xmath66 ) by using calculations performed at several lattice spacings and fitting appropriate polynomials to it .",

    "later on , a number of positive results have been reported from calculations with the canonical partition function @xcite , which suffer from small volumes , large cut - off effects and large quark masses .",
    "more recent calculations are based on estimating the radius of convergence of the taylor expansion in @xmath1 of some suitable observables @xcite .",
    "the problems here are twofold , first , only a few expansion coefficients are available which makes the estimate of the radius of convergence difficult .",
    "second , the first few expansion coefficients are in agreement with calculations from the hadron resonance gas model for @xmath130 .",
    "this models exhibits an infinite convergence radius and thus no critical point .",
    "nevertheless two groups report estimates for the convergence radius @xcite .      according the the scaling hypothesis",
    ", the free energy has a singular part that is responsible for the power laws that thermodynamic response functions exhibits near the critical point . for two degenerate light flavors of mass @xmath131 and one heavier strange quark mass @xmath132",
    ", we thus make the ansatz @xmath133 where the singular part @xmath134 will become a generalized homogeneous function of its arguments once the correct scaling fields have been chosen as its natural variables . in general , all @xmath135 and @xmath136 models exhibit two relevant scaling fields , the temperature - like ( @xmath137 ) and external field - like scaling fields ( @xmath138 ) . considering a critical point in the chiral limit ( @xmath139 ) and at zero chemical potentials ( @xmath140 ) the leading order dependence of the scaling fields on @xmath141 are determined by symmetry arguments , _",
    "i.e. _ to leading order @xmath138 depends only on couplings that break chiral symmetry in the light quark sector , while @xmath137 depends on all other couplings .",
    "we find @xmath142 where @xmath0 is the phase transition temperature and @xmath143 are non - universal scale parameters . here",
    "we have adopted the @xmath144 basis and assume @xmath145 as a finite isospin chemical potential @xmath146 would break the flavor symmetry in such a way that a different symmetry breaking pattern would arise . with the above scaling fields we can exploit the property of homogeneity of the function @xmath134 to obtain @xmath147",
    "the function @xmath148 is a universal scaling function that depend on a single scaling variable @xmath149 . in this way we have singled out the leading order singular behavior , but",
    "have neglected sub - leading terms that are produced by irrelevant scaling variables and are known as corrections to scaling . from here we can easily obtain the magnetic equation of state @xmath150 by taking a derivative with respect to @xmath151 , where the scaling function @xmath152 is connected to @xmath148 by @xmath153 note that this scaling form is not the famous widom - griffiths from , as the scaling variables do not depend on the magnetization .",

    "we obtain @xmath169 @xcite , which translates into a curvature of @xmath170 , associated with a change of the baryon chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "this result is not yet continuum extrapolated , but ultimately linked the critical behavior in the chiral limit .",
    "other results based on imaginary chemical potential or a taylor expansion of chiral and deconfining order parameter are in the range @xmath171 @xcite .",
    "we have reviewed selected results on the qcd phase structure and bulk thermodynamics , obtained by recent lattice calculations .",
    "we have discussed results on derivatives of the logarithm of the qcd partition function ( @xmath52 ) with respect to temperature and quark mass ( @xmath172 ) and various chemical potentials @xmath173 .",
    "results on correlation - functions have been not touched and are beyond the scope of this review .",
    "we have argued that the qcd equation of state ( eos ) , _ i.e. _ the pressure , energy and entropy density as a function of temperature , obtained by the integral of the temperature derivative of @xmath52 , has been reliably determined in the temperature interval of @xmath174 mev .",
    "the eos is the basis for every hydro dynamical model of the fireball created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we find that its low and high temperature limits seem to be in good agreement with hrg model calculations and ( re - summed ) perturbative qcd calculations , respectively .",
    "however , more refined calculations in both of these temperature limits are needed .",
    "we have shown that the behavior of the chiral condensate and ( mixed ) chiral susceptibility exhibit universal critical behavior in the chiral limit of ( @xmath175)-flavor qcd , which is taken by sending the quark mass of the two light flavors to zero while keeping the strange quark mass constant .",
    "matching qcd to the universal theory through the determination of a set of non - universal parameter , yields valuable informations on the qcd phase diagram . as an example we have discussed the pseudo - critical line as function of @xmath176 and @xmath1 .",
    "although we find a scaling behavior that is consistent with an @xmath118 symmetric critical point in the chiral limit , the possibility of a first order transition in the chiral limit and correspondingly a critical @xmath123 end - point at very small but finite quark masses is not excluded yet .",
    "this issue is closely related with the possibility of a sufficiently restored axial anomaly ( @xmath108-symmetry ) close to @xmath0 , which is currently subject to many lattice qcd calculations with chiral fermions .",
    "most studies do , however , support the opposite scenario that @xmath108 is strongly broken around @xmath0 .",
    "finally we have discussed derivatives of @xmath52 with respect to various chemical potentials ( generalized susceptibilities ) .",
    "we have introduced combinations of these generalized susceptibilities which allow for the disentanglement of the partial pressures of different hadronic sectors and thus lead to a better understanding of the relevant microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "we presented evidence for experimentally not yet measured strange and charmed hadrons and showed that also flavored hadrons start to melt at the chiral transition temperature .",
    "vise versa , we used similar combinations of these generalized susceptibility to investigate the approach to the free gas behavior .",
    "we find that the temperature range of @xmath177 can be characterized by a strongly interacting plasma of quarks , gluons and some remnants of hadron like states , while above @xmath178 the quasi - particle spectrum resembles that of quarks and gluons alone .",
    "the same generalized susceptibilities also encode the fluctuations of conserved charges , which are measured at rhic and lhc .",
    "we discussed certain ratios of cumulants of conserved charges and showed that from a fit to the corresponding experimentally measured data , the freeze - out temperature , as well as the freeze - out curvature can be obtained .",
    "we find that the so determined freeze - out line is in good agreement with current determinations of the pseudo - critical line .",
    "we emphasize that several of the @xmath179 and @xmath180 order susceptibilities that are used in the above summarized studies are not yet continuum extrapolated .",
    "although we do not expect large cut - off effects for these observables , continuum extrapolations are necessary to consolidate our findings and are currently work in progress .",
    "this will also allow to extent the range of the qcd equation of state to @xmath181 , which corresponds to the full range of the energy scan program at rhic @xcite .",
    "even though some results on @xmath182 order susceptibilities are already available and will be refined in future , it is evident that there are many interesting aspects on the qcd phase diagram that will never be in reach by a taylor expansion method .",
    "therefore a reformulation of qcd in terms of other variables that allows for direct simulations at nonzero chemical potential will be needed .",

    "<S> we review recent results on the phase structure of qcd and bulk qcd thermodynamics . in particular </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how universal critical scaling related to spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry manifests itself in recent lattice qcd simulations and how the knowledge on non - universal scaling parameter can be utilized in the exploration of the qcd phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how various ( generalized ) susceptibilities can be employed to characterize properties of qcd matter at low and hight temperatures , related to deconfining aspects of the qcd transition . </S>",
