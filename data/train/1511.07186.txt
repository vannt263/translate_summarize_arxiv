    "certain observational evidence seems to indicate that dark energy and dark matter , considered as dominant components of the cosmic fluid , can interact @xcite or perhaps an interaction between dynamical vacuum energy and matter it is also possible @xcite",
    ". appears unnatural to think that cosmic fluids coexist and do not interact with each other as is usual in the standard @xmath2 model ( both components evolve independently and satisfy usual energy conservation equations ) . as we know",
    ", @xmath2 , despite their successes , is theoretically unappealing because of several well known shortcomings , among other , a negative energy density for the dark energy at @xmath3 @xcite and the case @xmath4 ( phantom dark energy , which is not ruled out by the observational data ) , an interesting issue which it seems very difficult to understand within the @xmath2-framework .    on the other hand ,",
    "dark energy and dark matter , both , seen as ordinary fluids ( perfect fluids ) , is a simple assumption which is consistent to describe them . in other words , here , dark energy and dark matter",
    "are described under a representation of perfect fluids and in the literature we see nothing against this assumption .",
    "any case , it is an interesting approach if we are thinking that a perfect fluid is something that we know how to handle .",
    "components under interaction lead to a new perspective for describing / visualizing the cosmic evolution .",
    "there is a rich literature on the subject and for describing that interaction , for instance , various ansatzes for @xmath0 ( defined before ) are used . in other words , the @xmath0 function is put by hand given that the field equations so require .",
    "that is a first approximation to describe the interaction required by the observational data , but there is not formalism that allow us to obtain @xmath0 from first principles .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze thermodynamical aspects from the aforementioned interaction in the framework of two interacting fluids . and as already said , we will use the holographic philosophy for modeling the dark energy where the emphasis will put on the temperature evolution , during the cosmic evolution , from each fluid ( dark energy and dark matter .",
    "phase transitions ( seen as sign changes in the heat capacity ) will be also discussed .",
    "@xmath5 @xmath6 units will be used .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we present a brief description of two non - interacting fluids and we revise the behaviour of its temperatures through the cosmic evolution . in section iii we incorporate interaction and we revise the involved thermodynamics bearing in mind the second law . in section",
    "iv we we discuss the interaction under holographic considerations and we show the presence of phase transitions ( sign changes in its heat capacities ) experienced by both fluids during the evolution .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we have added an appendix in order to show explicitly the sign changes in the heat capacities of the interacting fluids .",
    "we consider , in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) , the non - interacting flat - flrw scheme between two components @xmath7 and @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the dark energy density , @xmath10 denotes the dark matter density , @xmath11 is the hubble parameter and dot denotes derivative with respect to the cosmic time .",
    "we assume that both components can be amenable to study by using a description under the rigorous scope of the thermodynamic laws .",
    "then , by using the equation @xmath12 , for a generic fluid , where @xmath13 is the temperature , @xmath14 the entropy , @xmath15 the energy density , @xmath16 its pressure and @xmath17 the physical volume , besides the integrability condition @xmath18 , we can obtain the following equation for the temperature during the cosmic evolution @xcite @xmath19 we have used @xmath20 , @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the redshift parameter and @xmath23 the cosmic scale factor with @xmath24 . since @xmath25 ( for a spatially flat section @xmath26 , see @xcite ) , we obtain @xmath27 . by considering for dark energy @xmath28 and for non - relativistic dark matter @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where@xmath31 @xcite , we can obtain @xmath32 after using ( 3 ) .",
    "so , @xmath33 i.e. , @xmath34 grows and @xmath35 decreases when @xmath22 goes to the future .",
    "this fact appears to be unusual if we want to think in energy transference from dark energy to dark matter , at least from some @xmath36 in the past , and @xmath37 as is suggested by the observational data @xcite .",
    "this point will be discussed later .",
    "*  * we do @xmath38 @xmath39 ^{1/5}-1,\\ ] ] @xmath40 nowdays we would expect that @xmath41 ( see later ) and in this case @xmath36 belongs to the past .",
    "but the problem is * *  * * @xmath36 * *  * * at the future .",
    "if we do not have equilibrium through the evolution , we can think in two options : only one sign of @xmath0 and then only one option for the inequality between the temperatures , @xmath42 or @xmath43 . nevertheless , there are holographic arguments in order to justify , at least in a theoretical scope , both options for the sign of @xmath0 @xcite . as a second option",
    "we can imagine that even when there are sign changes in @xmath0 , the amount of energy transferred is not enough for generating changes in the relation between @xmath44 and @xmath35 .",
    "but the thermodynamical constraint given by the second law rejects the latter option .    by following the reference @xcite",
    ", we ascribe a temperature ( gibbs integrability condition ) to the dark energy in the form @xmath45 , and we see that if @xmath46 , @xmath47 increases when @xmath9 decreases and vice versa . if we assume that the given relationship between temperature and energy density is valid for @xmath48 ( phantom dark energy , not ruled out by the observational data ) we have that @xmath47 and @xmath9 , both increase with the time and dark energy increasing in the future appears to be not only a conjeture .    on other hand , if we write for dark matter @xmath49 , we can see that @xmath50 ( dust ) drives to @xmath51 and if this were the case , we would have , from a thermodynamical point of view , a fluid without the ability of interacting with other and , in this sense , we could accept the idea developed in the reference @xcite : there is interaction , but @xmath52 .",
    "so , if we accept that both temperatures @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we repeat , the above mentioned idea appears to be interesting .    in the next sections we introduce the interaction and discuss its consequences for the evolution of the temperatures",
    "by using the interacting scheme @xmath55 or , equivalently @xmath56 where @xmath57 the temperatures are , respectively , @xmath58 and @xmath59 and here we have considered a generic @xmath60 for dark matter without any special commitment with it . in section iv we will use @xmath61 ( dust ) .    on the other hand , in presence of interaction , the entropy production associated to the interaction",
    "is @xmath62 @xmath63 , or , by using the redshift parameter @xmath64 = \\left ( \\frac{1}{t_{dm}\\left ( z\\right ) } -\\frac{1}{t_{de}\\left ( z\\right ) } \\right ) vq\\left ( z\\right ) \\geqslant 0,\\ ] ] @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 at late times @xmath67 .",
    "however , at early times @xmath68 ( a reasonable assumption ) , then we should have @xmath69 in order to satisfy the second law . as was said before",
    ", it may seem strange that today @xmath34 grows with @xmath22 if dark energy is transferring energy to dark matter ( @xmath70 ) at least from some @xmath36 ( [ eq : eq5 ] ) . can be a signal of a negative heat capacity for the dark energy ?",
    "as we will see in the next section , the incorporation of interaction shows explicitly this fact .",
    "moreover , the dark matter shows also phase transitions , in the past and in the future",
    ". sign changes of @xmath0 ( one in the past and another in the future ) can be visualized in reference @xcite where a holographic modeling for the dark energy was used beside the linear - parametrization @xmath71 , and @xmath72@xcite .",
    "we end this section by making a consistency check . by using the usual concepts of thermodynamics ,",
    "we deduce the equation for the evolution of the temperature for a generic fluid denoted by @xmath73 .",
    "we start by setting @xmath74 and @xmath75 , a reasonable setup .",
    "so , @xmath76 and @xmath77 so that @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "on the other hand , from the second law besides the integrability condition given before , it is straightforward to obtain the expression @xmath80 .\\ ] ] by replacing this last expression in ( [ eq : eq13 ] ) and by using the non - conservation equation @xmath81 where @xmath82 for dark energy and @xmath83 for dark matter , we can obtain @xmath84 and by using the redshift parameter , we write the last equation in the form @xmath85 , \\ ] ] so that , for dark energy @xmath86 , \\label{eq : eq18}\\ ] ] and for dark matter @xmath87 .",
    "\\label{eq : eq19}\\ ] ] now , we compare the expressions given in ( [ eq : eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq18 ] ) , i. e. , @xmath88 , \\label{eq : eq20}\\ ] ] and @xmath89 , \\label{eq : eq21}\\ ] ] where we have done @xmath90  @xmath91 .",
    "the consistency between ( [ eq : eq20 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq21 ] ) indicates that @xmath92 and the same occurs if we compare ( [ eq : eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq19 ] ) @xmath93 as it is expected ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one approach for treating the @xmath0-function is by considering the following ansatz @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are both constant parameters to be determined by observations .",
    "according to observational settings , both parameters have equal sign and so there is not sign change in @xmath0 @xcite .    the second approach , which we will use from now on , is based on a holographic model @xmath97 , \\label{eq : eq25}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are both positive parameters which are well confined by the observational data : @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "the infrared cut - off given for @xmath9 @xcite can be understood as a generalization of the model @xmath101 @xcite , where @xmath102 is the ricci scalar given by @xmath103 or , as an extension of the holographic model @xmath104 proposed by m. li @xcite . _ _  _ _ in the last case , the key idea is to use the holographic principle @xcite and its possible role in cosmology .",
    "_  _ this approach is an open issue and , under this philosophy , the model given in ( [ eq : eq25 ] ) it is an interesting start point in order to visualize what we mean by dark energy .",
    "this is a crucial fact if we are thinking ( the usual ) in dark energy seen as a cosmological constant , although the observational data would indicate that @xmath9  is not necessarily a constant @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the _ _  _ _ @xmath105 model could be questioned , despite their successes .    by using ( [ eq :",
    "eq25 ] ) besides ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq6 ] ) , it is possible to write @xmath106 and so @xmath107 so that we can obtain an explicit expression for @xmath0 @xmath108 \\omega _ { de}+\\beta \\left ( 1+z\\right ) d\\omega _ { de}/dz } { \\left ( 2 + 3\\beta \\omega _ { de}\\right ) ^{2}}. \\label{eq : eq28}\\ ] ] the interaction sign can change through the evolution as can be seen from the ansatz @xmath109 ( see later ) .",
    "therefore , according to ( [ eq : eq28 ] ) and by using the ansatz given before , @xmath110 experiences two sign changes , one in the past and another in the future , as can be seen in @xcite .",
    "but , what does it mean a sign change of @xmath0 at late times ? , would we have dominion of dark matter again ? , the current accelerated expansion would be transient previous to a possible future collapse ?",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand , and under an entropic philosophy ( entropic cosmology )",
    "in which we have an amount of nonconservation energy , we can observe sign changes in it and , in particular , that sign is mainly dependent of the equation of state parameter ( @xmath111 ) in each stage of the cosmic evolution @xcite .",
    "but , models based in entropic considerations appear to be somewhat inconsistent with the observational data @xcite .    and",
    ", under a holographic philosophy also , if we are considering an interaction between the bulk and the boundary of the spacetime , we can see sign changes in @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "now , by using ( [ eq : eq28 ] ) besides ( [ eq : eq27 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq26 ] ) into ( [ eq : eq8 ] ) , we write @xmath112 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath113 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath110 can be written in the form @xmath114 and the temperatures are given , respectively , by @xmath115 and @xmath116 where @xmath117 and we have considered @xmath61 ( dust ) . the parameters involved are : @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "all these parameters were estimated by using an adjustment with type i supernovae ( union 2 ) @xcite and from them we have @xmath122 , and @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 ; @xmath126 and @xmath127 . in order to have a good vision of the figures shown below , the following limits can be obtained from ( [ eq : eq32]-[eq : eq33 ] ) @xmath128 and @xmath129 according to ( [ eq : eq29]-[eq : eq30 ] ) , we note that if @xmath130 and @xmath61 both temperatures are equal .",
    "this last situation does not appears to be consistent , is this a signal that @xmath131 through the evolution ?     and its two sign changes : for @xmath132 we have @xmath133 , and @xmath134 otherwise.,width=226 ]     in the range @xmath132 , i.e. , when @xmath135 and @xmath136 for @xmath137 , i.e. , when @xmath134 , in accord to the second law .",
    "however , in the range @xmath138 , when @xmath134 , the quotient @xmath139 diverges.,width=226 ]     always grows and the dark energy exhibits a negative heat capacity from @xmath140 to @xmath141 ( dark energy is heated while being delivered energy to dark matter ) .",
    "out the indicated range , we have a positive heat capacity .",
    "and @xmath47 diverges when @xmath22 goes to @xmath142.,width=226 ]     grows from @xmath143 to @xmath144 ( maximum of @xmath145 ) and goes to zero when @xmath146 .",
    "the dark matter heat capacity experiences a sign change , that is , from @xmath147 to @xmath148 we have a negative heat capacity ( dark matter is heated while being delivered energy to dark energy ) , from @xmath149 to @xmath150 the heat capacity is positive , from @xmath150 to @xmath151 its heat capacity is negative ( dark matter cools while receiving energy ) and from @xmath151 to @xmath152 the heat capacity is positive.,width=226 ]    so , sign changes in @xmath0 imply changes in the temperatures of dark energy and dark matter , as dictates the second law .",
    "additionally , we can visualize phase transitions , sign changes in its heat capacities , for both energy densities .",
    "see appendix for details .",
    "clearly , the observational data eventually will tell us if these changes will definitely occur .",
    "today , the observational data is only just showing signals of the presence of @xmath0 , but as we stated above , appears unnatural to think that cosmic fluids coexist and do not interact with each other . additionally , nothing we can say about values of @xmath153 and @xmath154 : future observations could elucidate this point .    and roughly speaking , * *  * * the sign change in the cosmic acceleration ( @xmath155 ) is located `` inside '' the zone where @xmath156 .",
