    ", we want to point out that the techniques portrayed in sections  [ s-1 ] ,  [ s-2 ] and in the present one apply as well to the more general situation examined in  @xcite : namely , for any two subspaces @xmath162 , @xmath163 , of a finite - dimensional @xmath14-vector space @xmath5 , we may associate an @xmath0-category with two objects , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath6 and @xmath7 , two @xmath0-algebras @xmath17 and @xmath18 and an @xmath0-@xmath17-@xmath18-bimodule @xmath3 .    more explicitly , @xmath17 , resp .",
    "@xmath18 , is the @xmath0-algebra associated to the graded vector space of global ( regular ) sections of the exterior algebra of the normal bundle of @xmath6 , resp .  of @xmath7 , in @xmath5 ( with obvious product and trivial differential ) ; @xmath3 is the graded vector space of global ( regular ) sections of the exterior algebra of the quotient bundle @xmath164 over @xmath165 , and the @xmath0-bimodule structure extends the natural left @xmath17- and right @xmath18-action : of course , @xmath17 , resp .",
    "@xmath18 , resp .",
    "@xmath3 , must be understood as the endomorphism space of @xmath6 , resp .  of @xmath7 , resp .",
    "the space of morphisms from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , declaring trivial the remaining one . we do not indulge in its explicit construction : suffice it to say that it involves ( once again ) kontsevich s diagrammatic techniques , and we observe that it reduces , when @xmath8 and @xmath9 , to the one we have made explicit in the previous computations .    as already remarked in  (",
    "* subsection 7.3 ) , there is also a koszul complex @xmath166 _ e.g. _ for @xmath17 , whose construction is similar to the one of @xmath4 in section  [ s-2 ] , with obvious due changes ; again , @xmath166 can be given the structure of a dg @xmath17-@xmath18-bimodule ( hence , of an @xmath0-@xmath17-@xmath18-bimodule ) .",
    "furthermore , there is a natural ( graded ) version of the quasi - isomorphism   from the koszul complex @xmath166 to the bar resolution of @xmath3 as a left @xmath17-module : then , a more involved vanishing lemma , proved in the same spirit of theorem  [ t - koszul - bar-1 ] , identity  , and a more refined version of identity  , imply that such a quasi - isomorphism extends to an @xmath0-quasi - isomorphism of @xmath17-@xmath18-bimodules .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ t - koszul - bar ] holds true in the more general situation of  @xcite .",
    "since keller s condition in  @xcite holds true in the more general situation already examined , _",
    "i.e. _ for a dg category with two objects @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and with spaces of morphisms given by @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( the endomorphisms of @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively ) and @xmath166 ( the morphisms from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ) , a natural question is , if it is possible to formulate and prove the main result of  @xcite in this more general setting , using tamarkin s results instead of kontsevich s ."
