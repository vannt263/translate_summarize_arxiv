    "concurrent observations of long - wavelength afterglow and ongoing gamma - ray burst ( grb ) activity should , in principle , yield important constraints on the nature of the physical processes of the emission ( eg . , @xcite ) .",
    "however , as a grb typically lasts less than 100  s , it is challenging for large ground - based optical / infrared follow - up facilities to react to a grb alert quickly and take data during the prompt phase . multi - color observations , which provide vital information on the emission mechanism , are even more difficult to obtain during the prompt phase because of the added overhead associated with changing filters .",
    "nevertheless , due to the coordinated efforts of recent space missions ( _ hete - ii _",
    ", @xcite ; _ swift _ , @xcite ) to detect grbs and various ground - based optical follow - up programs , observations during the prompt phase of grbs are no longer uncommon  the optical afterglows ( oas ) of several dozen grbs have been observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , while others have plateau ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) phases . even among grbs with relatively simple behavior",
    ", however , short - timescale features not predicted in the basic shock models often appear in sufficiently well - sampled data .",
    "various modifications to the standard picture have been proposed to explain such observations , including the presence of a jet with single ( e.g. , @xcite ) or multiple ( e.g. , @xcite ) components , refreshed shocks @xcite , central engine activity @xcite , gravitational microlensing @xcite , and density irregularity in the grb environment @xcite .",
    "observationally , constraints on the change in the afterglow color and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) play an important role in limiting the viability of models for a particular grb .",

    "the multi - color photometric evolution of the grb 071003 oa is shown in figure [ fig : lc ] , fitted by our preferred model ( described later ) .",
    "visual inspection of the light curves reveals what appear to be three distinct components : an overall power - law decline that has already set in by the very first measurement at 42  s , a small `` bump '' feature at @xmath40120600  s , and then a dramatic , but unfortunately not well sampled , rebrightening starting around 3000  s that dominates the remainder of the evolution .",
    "the bump feature appears to be additive only : fitting a single power law to measure the decay index ( @xmath119 ) for the clear - band data both before this period and after it , the power - law indices ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively ) are fully consistent with each other and with the overall decay index over both periods ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the rebrightening is more difficult to characterize .",
    "we have no observations between the keck i hires guider point at @xmath65 hr and our observations the second night ; moreover , the points reported in the gcns are highly discrepant .",
    "an optical @xmath9-band limit is reported at @xmath123  hr by @xcite , which seems to contradict the rebrightening trend suggested by the aeos data and guider point .",
    "it is unlikely that the oa would show such a dramatic drop ( @xmath124 mag ) in a short time interval at such late times , so we suspect that the oa might be heavily contaminated by the bright nearby star and was not resolved in the lulin 1-m telescope images of @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath125-band detection at @xmath126 hr reported by @xcite supports a rebrightening but is several magnitudes above the extrapolated light curve at this time , seemingly far too bright to be consistent with our observations .",
    "calibration and the contamination from the bright star are the likely causes of the discrepancy .",
    "the bat and xrt light curves we derive for grb  071003 are also shown in figure [ fig : lc ] . unfortunately , because _ swift _ was still in the process of returning to normal operations after its gyro failure @xcite , automatic slewing to grb  071003 was disabled at the time when the grb was detected . as a result",
    ", there were no prompt xrt observations for grb 071003 , leaving a long gap in the gamma - ray / x - ray light curve at @xmath12720000  s. in particular , there are no x - ray observations until approximately the peak of the rebrightening in the optical band .",
    "nevertheless , direct comparison of the data available reveals three relevant facts .",
    "first , there is no obvious optical prompt counterpart to the last spike of the gamma - ray light curve .",
    "however , this spike is nearly contemporaneous with the much more slowly rising optical bump feature ; we return to this possible connection in our later modeling (  4.5 ) .",
    "second , at late times the x - ray light curve declines as a power law with decay index consistent with that observed in the optical .",
    "a simple power law fits the data well , with a best - fit decay index of @xmath128 .",
    "in addition , the late - time oa behavior ( after @xmath129  s ) is consistent with a single power - law decay with an index of @xmath130 , fully consistent with this value .",
    "as we note later , an extrapolation of the x - ray spectral index is also consistent with the optical observations , suggesting that at late times there is no need for an additional x - ray contribution ( such as inverse compton ) or large amounts of host - galaxy extinction .    finally ,",
    "while the gamma rays are scaled arbitrarily in figure [ fig : lc ] , we note that if we extrapolate the gamma - ray spectrum into the x - rays to compare the bat and xrt light curves , the evolution between the end of the prompt emission and the start of the xrt observations is nearly consistent with a simple extension of the late - time xrt power law back to earlier times , without a need for a rebrightening or break .",
    "however , _",
    "swift _ has shown previously @xcite that early - time x - ray light curves can conceal a wide variety of complex features , so we will not speculate further as to whether or not this was actually the case .",
    "the procedure used to model the optical light curve is generally the same as that employed by @xcite , but further generalized . for our fit model , we employ an unbroken power - law decay ( component 0 ) plus two @xcite functions ( broken power - law pairs , components 1 and 2 ) , but allow for different values of the functional parameters for each filter and component .",
    "the functional form is    @xmath131    where for component 0 , @xmath132 is the power - law decay index , and @xmath133 is an adjustment to the _ swift_/bat trigger time . for cmponent 1 ,",
    "@xmath134 and @xmath135 are the power - law decay indices for the rising and declining components , respectively , @xmath136 is an adjustment to the _",
    "swift_/bat trigger time , @xmath137 is the time of the peak flux , and @xmath138 is the sharpness parameter .",
    "component 2 has a similar function as component 1 .",
    "fitting this function with no constraints generates unrealistic results because of non - uniform sampling in different filters .",
    "however , we can make the following physically motivated assumptions to tie specific parameters and produce more physically meaningful results .    1 .",
    "we assume that the temporal decay index at any given time is independent of the filter , as is implicit in the notation ( @xmath47 does not depend on @xmath17 ) .",
    "this means that the color of a component can not change except while the light curve of that component is breaking . 2 .",
    "most importantly , we assume that differences between the spectra of the various model components can be described by changes in the power - law index of the intrinsic spectrum , modified by an arbitrary , but fixed , extinction law .",
    "mathematically , this constraint is expressed as @xmath139 .",
    "physically , this assumption requires that external effects such as extinction , which might cause the spectrum of any component to deviate from a power law , affect all components equally and are not time - dependent .",
    "the extinction law itself ( as well as the _ absolute _ underlying index of any specific component ) is fully general and can be fitted according to various models later .",
    "3 .   in addition",
    ", we assume that the rising segments of each component are also power laws , but not necessarily the same power laws as the falling segment , to allow for chromatic breaks . this imposes the following condition : @xmath140 . here",
    "@xmath141 and @xmath142 refer to `` before '' and `` after '' the break of a specific component ( 0 , 1 , or 2 ) , where the component index is omitted for clarity , and @xmath143 and @xmath144 refer to two different filters .",
    "fitting is performed , under these assumptions , using the idl package mpfit.craigm/idl/idl.html . ]",
    "the assumptions involved in these constraints are , of course , oversimplifications for the full array of models that might be considered . in particular",
    ", this model allows only one break per component , but with an evolving synchrotron light curve plus a jet we may expect as many as three . however , it has the advantage of being simple and generates a single physically motivated parameter quantifying color change over each component .",
    "we perform a variety of fits under varying combinations of assumptions .",
    "some of the possibilities we considered include the following :    1 .   forcing the bump ( component 1 ) to have the same color as the uniform decay ( component 0 ) , or allowing it to be a different color overall .",
    "2 .   forcing the bump itself to be achromatic over its evolution , or allowing it to contain a chromatic break .",
    "3 .   forcing the late rebrightening ( component 2 ) to have the same color as the uniform decay , or allowing it to have a different color .",
    "4 .   fixing @xmath133 for the early steep decay to be zero ( the bat trigger time ) , or allowing it to be free to vary .",
    "5 .   fixing @xmath136 for the bump component to be zero , to be equal to the beginning of the prompt - emission pulse that is nearly contemporaneous with it , or allowing it to be free to vary .",
    "6 .   fixing @xmath145 for the late rebrightening to be zero , or allowing it to be free to vary .",
    "the results under various combinations of these assumptions are presented in tables [ tab : colorchange ] and [ tab : t0 ] .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results in the remainder of the paper .",
    "detection of a grb afterglow in filtered observations during prompt emission , as was the case here , is rare .",
    "the situation is even more intriguing since our multi - color prompt oa observations show an apparent bump feature ( component 1 ) that is nearly contemporaneous with a rebrightening pulse in the gamma - ray light curve .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to attempt to measure the color of component 1 . by the same token , we have good spectral coverage of the afterglow both during the primary normal decay and during the fading of the dramatic late rebrightening , and any color difference may shed light on the origin of these features .",
    "we tested for color differences in three places : between component 0 ( rapid decay ) and component 1 ( bump ) , between component 0 and component 2 ( rebrightening ) , and over the break of component 1 itself ( since the rising spectral index may differ from the falling spectral index ) .",
    "in all cases we find evidence for color variation , although in each case only at the @xmath146 level .",
    "the fading component of the bump is redder than the fading component of the uniform decay by @xmath147 = 0.75 @xmath99 0.34 , the bump feature is chromatic with a shift from the rising to falling component of @xmath147 = 1.11 @xmath99 0.47 , and the rebrightening ( for which we only have color information during the fading component ) is also redder , by @xmath147 = 0.84 @xmath99 0.31 .",
    "one must be somewhat cautious in interpreting these results  since different filters sample the data differently , systematic errors that affect only one portion of the light curve can masquerade as color change .",
    "data reduction for grb 071003 was also challenging due to the presence of the nearby bright star , as detailed in  3 .",
    "in addition , we note that the degree of spectral index shifts noted is dependent on the model . in spite of these considerations ,",
    "however , we feel that our conclusion of color change is reasonably secure in each case .",
    "it is often unclear what time is most appropriate to use as @xmath148 when fitting a power law to a grb afterglow .",
    "thanks to the extremely early - time clear - band data , it is possible to fit @xmath148 and constrain this within a few seconds in the case of grb 071003 .",
    "this fit , notably , gives a @xmath148 of exactly the trigger time ( @xmath149  s ) .",
    "the gamma - ray light curve ( figure [ fig : grblc ] ) fluence is strongly dominated by the initial pulse , which rises sharply and peaks within a few seconds , so this is not necessarily surprising .",
    "some authors @xcite have presented evidence of an optical component rising coincident with the prompt emission , although significantly longer lasting .",
    "we can analyze whether the bump component observed in grb  071003 may be such a feature by determining whether or not it can be fitted with a pulse that rises abruptly , contemporaneous with the prompt emission . while our power - law model is somewhat simplified and the sampling of the rise is extremely poor , we find that it generally does not : the best - fit @xmath148 is intermediate between the trigger time and the time of the prompt emission spike ( @xmath40125  s ) at @xmath150  s. this is a model - independent result , although it rests mostly on one data - point : the initial @xmath7-band measurement , representing an integration from 97 to 117  s after the bat trigger ( @xmath4018  s before the rise of the prompt emission spike ) , lies 0.14 mag above a simple power - law extrapolation from regions of the data excluding the bump , compared to a photometric error of only 0.03 mag . while it is possible to envision scenarios where a relatively slow optical rise might follow a gamma - ray pulse ( any broadband feature with hard - to - soft evolution , or perhaps a late internal shock that later collides with and energizes the external shock )",
    ", no model to our knowledge can explain why an optical flare would precede a gamma - ray pulse , so we take this as evidence that the two features are physically unconnected .",
    "while our sampling around the rise and peak of the late - time rebrightening is poor ( and dominated by the difficult - to - calibrate aeos and hires guider images ) , we can also attempt to fit the @xmath148 for the rebrightening component .",
    "this is significantly different from @xmath151 , with a best - fit initial time of @xmath152  s. ( this is well short of its peak time of approximately 20  ks , so the effect on the light curve is minor . )",
    "no prompt - like fluctuations or other features are observed in the light curve in this region .",
    "grb 071003 is rare among _ swift _ bursts for having a bright radio afterglow .",
    "we were able to successfully detect the afterglow at two frequencies and several epochs spanning @xmath40220  days after the burst , including observations nearly contemporaneous with our optical data .",
    "the data are plotted in figure [ fig : vlalc ] .",
    "this grb is not far off the galactic plane , and the radio observations are affected by scintillation .",
    "following @xcite , the afterglow is in the strong scattering regime for both x and c bands .",
    "an approximate modulation index ( which estimates the fractional rms variation ) is 0.4 in the c band and 0.6 in the x band , over a refractive timescale of @xmath400.5  days in the x band and 2  days in the c band .",
    "this is longer than any integration ( so the error is not reduced by integration time ) but shorter than the interval between exposures ( so errors are uncorrelated ) .",
    "radio data were fitted using both an unbroken power - law model and a singly broken power - law model .",
    "we attempted the fit both before including uncertainties due to scintillation and with an additional 40% flux error added to all c - band points and 60% error added to all x - band points .        without the additional flux errors ,",
    "the unbroken model is a poor fit , with @xmath153 .",
    "a single , monochromatic break improves the fit dramatically ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "this improvement is significant at 97.4% confidence .",
    "a monochromatic radio break of this nature is very difficult to explain physically .",
    "however , with scintillation flux errors folded into the light curve , we find that a simple power law is a more than adequate fit to the data ( @xmath155 ) , which may suggest that we have overestimated the degree of modulation somewhat .",
    "( this is to be expected : the modulation index calculated is an upper limit as it strictly applies only for a point source .",
    "the afterglow has a physical size , which quenches the scintillation modulation somewhat . ) therefore , as a final modification , we scaled down this additional error until the final @xmath156 .",
    "properties of the temporal fits are given in table [ tab : radiomodel ] .",
    "the uncertainty due to scintillation is in any event too large to allow any firm conclusions about the light curve .",
    "however , since only refractive scintillation is expected to be significant , the refractive timescale is much longer than the several - hour timescale of individual observations , and the c - band observations were in all cases taken immediately after the x - band observations , we do consider the measurement of the radio spectral index ( @xmath157 ) to be trustworthy regardless of any scintillation uncertainty .",
    "if our modeling assumptions are accurate ( or nearly so ) , we can use our model to calculate the sed at any time using a combination of all the data available , rather than restricting the measurement to a small subset of the photometry and filters , even if the data were acquired at very different times in the evolution of the grb and the color is not constant .",
    "we calculate the sed at two epochs .",
    "first , we calculate the sed at @xmath158  days after the burst , the time of our four - color gemini - south observations . in calculating this",
    "sed , we perform a slightly modified light - curve fit : we do not perform any filter transformations ( e.g. , to convert @xmath69 to @xmath9 ) , but we fix all non - sed parameters to that derived from the light - curve analysis . in addition , we add in quadrature a calibration uncertainty equal to 5% in all filters , with a few exceptions . for @xmath71 , we use a 15% uncertainty . for @xmath68 ,",
    "we use a 30% uncertainty , for reasons described earlier .",
    "finally , for @xmath159 , we use a large extra uncertainty of 50% due to the possibility of a temporal break sometime between our last optical observations and the ao observations .",
    "( however , if such a break is absent , then the @xmath159 observation is much more precise than is given on the plots . )",
    "unfiltered observations are not used .",
    "we also calculate an early - time sed during the `` normal '' power - law decay at @xmath160  s , using a fit excluding late - time measurements and measurements during the ( possibly chromatic ) bump .",
    "addition of uncertainties is as for the late - time sed .",
    "the resulting seds are plotted in figures [ fig : sed1000 ] and [ fig : sed2day ] . after removing the effects of galactic extinction ( but not yet considering non - galactic extinction ) , both seds are a reasonable fit to a power law , providing a general confirmation of our assumptions as well as indicating that the host or intervening galaxies do not impose a great deal of frequency - dependent extinction . in support of our analysis from the light - curve modeling ,",
    "the spectral indices appear to differ from early to late times : @xmath161 = 0.62 @xmath99 0.33 , while @xmath162 = 1.25 @xmath99 0.09 .",
    "( these values are direct fits to the data and do not include the effects of the small amount of extragalactic extinction we do believe to be present , which we discuss shortly . )    unfortunately there were no early - time observations outside the optical band , since _ swift _ was unable to slew rapidly .",
    "however , this grb was observed nearly simultaneously in x - rays , optical , and radio during the declining phase of the late rebrightening .",
    "therefore , it is possible to calculate a coeval late - time spectrum at all wavelengths simultaneously .",

    "2008 , submitted ) the bright nearby star , however , poses a formidable obstacle for non - ao ground - based observations .",
    "the measured gamma - ray fluence of 5.32 ( @xmath840.67 , + 0.30 ) @xmath194 erg @xmath20 ( konus , 20  kev4  mev : @xcite ) can be converted to an isotropic - equivalent total energy release in the host frame : @xmath195 @xmath196 3.4 ( @xmath840.6 , + 0.2 ) @xmath197 erg  well in the upper range of _ swift _ events .",
    "no clear jet break is observed over the course of our observations , in either the optical bands or the x - ray , out to at least 6 @xmath44 @xmath198  s. there is a possible monochromatic break in the radio bands at around 8  days ( @xmath199  s ) , but it appears likely to be a scintillation artifact ( see  4.6 ) .",
    "using this limit , and following @xcite , for a uniform circumburst medium we can calculate the minimum jet opening angle and minimum collimation - corrected energy . using standard values for the radiative efficiency ( @xmath200 ) and circumburst density ( @xmath201 @xmath202 ) ( the end result is nearly insensitive to these parameters ) , we have    @xmath203    however , as we discuss later , the late - time afterglow behavior in this case favors a wind model .",
    "thus , following @xcite we have    @xmath204    the upper limit on @xmath205 of 7  days gives a limit on the opening of at least 3.1 @xmath206 deg .",

    "therefore the collimation - corrected energy is at least @xmath208 @xmath209 2 @xmath210 @xmath211 erg .",
    "it is also possible that the jet break is hidden by the complicated evolution of the burst , including the rebrightening , which would imply more modest energetics for this burst .",
    "however , as the late - time slope is still relatively shallow ( @xmath212 ; generally we expect @xmath213 after a jet break ) we consider this relatively unlikely .",
    "we first turn our attention to the rapidly declining power law .",
    "the temporal behavior of this feature is quite simple , with a decay constant @xmath47 = 1.466 @xmath99 0.006 and no evident substructure before the `` bump '' or after it .",
    "there is no evidence of a rising component or any early break .",
    "the observed spectral index @xmath176 = 0.62 @xmath99 0.33 , although if the extinction measured at late times is also present at early times ( as we expect ) , the intrinsic index is actually shallower ; correcting this using our preferred extinction model , we derive @xmath176 = 0.29 @xmath99 0.49 .",
    "especially when the decay is observed to flatten later , very early - time decay of this nature is often interpreted as a reverse shock .",
    "this seems possible  the spectral and temporal indices are within the range of predictions for reverse - shock models ( specifically , the thick - shell case of @xcite ) .",
    "however , a forward - shock origin is also consistent . examining the standard closure relations between @xmath47 and @xmath176 ( as in , for example , @xcite ) , all environment models ( ism , wind , and jet ) are consistent with the constraints derived from the data , largely because the early - time constraint on @xmath176 is poor .",
    "( we discuss the forward vs.  reverse - shock models for this emission again in  5.3 , in connection with the late - time rebrightening . )",
    "the bump feature is of considerable interest , since it is nearly simultaneous with a prompt - emission pulse .",
    "however , as discussed earlier , the temporal analysis seems to disfavor the interpretation as a prompt reverberation : the bump seems to be already rising even before the prompt spike .",
    "another possible explanation for the origin of this feature is a large density variation in the surrounding medium ( a large clump or other discrete physical feature in the path of the expanding shock ) .",
    "the observed pulse width @xmath214 is consistent with a density variation , and the general appearance of the light curve over this region is reminiscent of simulations of a grb forward shock intersecting ism density enhancements ( e.g. , figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , our observation of possible color change across the bump would ( if real ) disfavor this hypothesis , at least in the simplest models : density variation will not change the intrinsic spectrum , unless either the microphysical parameters or cooling frequency suddenly and significantly change .",
    "we consider this unlikely , although some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have discussed the role of variable microphysics in previous grb afterglows .",
    "alternatively , the observation that the fast - declining component seems completely unaffected by the afterglow ( the temporal indices before and after are effectively identical ) leads us to interpret the bump as originating from a distinct emission episode  given the rapid rise and fall and the hint of blue - to - red evolution we suggest that it arises from internal - shock emission .",
    "hard - to - soft evolution and an underlying power - law decay not affected by the flare have also been seen in x - ray flares @xcite .",
    "we also note that earlier studies of grb prompt emission have shown pulses observed at lower energy to be broader than those at higher energy @xcite ; this trend may continue into the optical band .",
    "the broader , smoother profile of this pulse relative to the much faster - evolving x - ray flares may in this case illustrate important attributes of the emission  either from viewing effects or resulting from the physics of the emission itself .",
    "the rebrightening phase of this burst is quite dramatic .",
    "while our observations do not sample the peak of the emission , a fit with a reasonable assumption of the sharpness parameter suggests that the flux increased by approximately 1 mag , and the amount of integrated optical flux released during the rebrightening is comparable to or more than that emitted by the early afterglow .",
    "a rise in optical flux of more than a magnitude at intermediate times ( well after the end of prompt emission , but before any supernova component ) has to our knowledge been seen in only a handful of previous cases : grbs 970508 @xcite , 041219a @xcite , 060729 @xcite , 070420 @xcite , and 070311 @xcite .",
    "the rebrightening is also notable because it appears to differ subtly from the early decay , even though the evolution of both curves is generally quite simple .",
    "the decay index and spectral index both steepen , by @xmath215 = 0.25 @xmath99 0.14 and @xmath147 = 0.80 @xmath99 0.30 , respectively . assuming a synchrotron spectrum , there are only two possible origins for this  the optical band is in different synchrotron regimes at different times ( specifically , @xmath216 before cooling , and @xmath217 after cooling , consistent with the changes observed ) , or because of a shift in the electron index @xmath218 by approximately @xmath219 = + 0.4 .",
    "we consider several physical origins for the rebrightening feature : the appearance of the forward shock when the burst ejecta first decelerate against the ism , the late - time peak of a pre - existing forward shock due to evolution of the critical frequencies , impact of the forward shock through a density variation , and rebrightening caused by a refreshed shock .",
    "_ appearance of forward shock _",
    " when the grb ejecta first begin to sweep up an amount of matter from the ism comparable to the energy in the ejecta , they begin to decelerate , and reverse and forward shocks are propagated back into the ejecta and forward into the ism , respectively ; depending on the lorentz factor , both shocks can then rise very quickly .",
    "we consider this scenario extremely unlikely to be relevant , since by necessity the forward and reverse shocks must rise simultaneously , and there is no explanation for the bright early - time component in the burst  save for a prompt model connected with internal shocks , but as we have already shown , there is no evidence linking the early optical behavior with the high - energy emission .",
    "_ spectral peak of existing forward shock _ ",
    "a more reasonable model postulates that the reverse and forward shocks both formed extremely early , but because they evolve differently ( the reverse shock , whose synchrotron parameters are boosted down by factors of @xmath220 , begins to fade immediately , while the forward shock will rise at lower frequencies ) , the reverse shock fades rapidly , while the forward shock can rise and peak when the synchrotron frequency @xmath221 passes through the optical band .",
    "this model has , for example , been invoked to explain early - time bumps in the light curves of grb  021004 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , grb  050525a @xcite , and grb  080319b @xcite , which level off significantly ( but do not rebrighten ) at around @xmath222 s. however , this model is problematic here : although we have only sparse observations of the rebrightening , the observed rising temporal index of @xmath47 = @xmath841.12 @xmath99 0.16 is far too fast to be consistent with a rising phase of a forward adiabatic shock , which predicts @xmath223 (= @xmath224 for a constant - density ism and constant for a wind ) .",
    "therefore , the synchrotron peak of the forward shock alone can not explain this feature .    _ density variation _  a third possibility , not invoking the transition between reverse and forward shocks ,",
    "might be a dramatic density variation : for example , the impact of the shock wave into a previously ejected circumstellar shell , or emergence of the shock from a low - density cavity into a dense external medium .",
    "density fluctuations have been successfully invoked to explain low - level variations in several previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the timescale of the rebrightening ( @xmath225 @xmath62 1 ) is consistent with a density - fluctuation origin @xcite . however , in this case we would expect neither a change in the spectral index ( as is probably observed ) nor such a slow decline after the peak , with a temporal index that differs significantly but only slightly from the value of the initial decay .",
    "furthermore , detailed numerical studies by numerous authors @xcite have failed to reproduce anything but the smallest rebrightening signatures in previous grbs using density variations .",
    "_ multi - component jet _  the complicated light curve of grb  030329 has been interpreted @xcite as the result of two separate forward shocks , arising from two different jet components : a narrow , highly relativistic jet whose emission peaks extremely early , plus a wide , more mildly relativistic jet that dominates the late - time and radio evolution .",
    "could this model conceivably explain the observations of grb  071003 ? while a complete analysis is beyond the scope of this paper , we note that the observations do seem consistent : the similarities of late - time decay of both rapid and late - time components are naturally explained , the timescale of our rebrightening is similar to that observed in grb  030329 , and ( notably ) the most significant criticism of the two - jet interpretation of grb  030329 ( that the rebrightening rose too rapidly and peaked too sharply  @xcite ) does not apply here : the rebrightening in this case is much smoother than that observed for grb 030329 .    _",
    "refreshed shock _  finally , we consider the possibility that this feature is due to a discrete energy reinjection energizing the forward shock , such as via a slow - moving shell that catches up to the forward shock at late times after it decelerates .",
    "this seems consistent with all observations , although largely by virtue of not making strong predictions ; by invoking a customized pattern of energy reinjection at the right times , a very broad space of light curve behavior can be modeled @xcite .",
    "we do note that a large , sudden rebrightening of this nature may also produce a ( second ) reverse shock , which would be observable in radio and decline rapidly with time .",
    "the radio flux does in fact decay somewhat ( in contrast to the expectation from a forward - shock model , where the radio flux is constant or rising ) , and the measured @xmath226 is not far from the predicted decay constant for a reverse shock of @xmath227 in the @xmath228 frequency regime @xcite .",
    "however , the radio decay could conceivably be due to other effects ( e.g. , late jet break ) , and without an independent measurement of the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath221 and late - time lorentz factor @xmath229 we are unable to further constrain the presence or absence of such a feature with the limited observations available .",
    "we therefore find that only the multi - component jet and refreshed shock models are consistent with all available data .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have sufficient observations during the rising phase of the rebrightening to distinguish the two models ; in particular , we can set no constraints on the color evolution and lack a detailed light curve of the rise to peak of the rebrightening .",
    "we do note that the x - ray observations are already decaying well before the ( probable ) optical peak by an extrapolation of our observations ( figure [ fig : lc ] ) , which may suggest hard - to - soft evolution in this feature as well .",
    "however , as noted earlier , the x - ray decay extrapolates back to the bat light curve without explicit need for a rebrightening , so without earlier x - ray measurements this association is speculative .      in the simplest models ,",
    "the late - time light curve of any grb is fixed by a number of basic parameters : microphysical parameters @xmath230 ( the fraction of energy in magnetic fields ) , @xmath231 ( the fraction of energy in electrons ) , and @xmath218 ( the electron energy index ) ; macroscopic parameters @xmath232 ( the blastwave energy ) and @xmath233 ( the jet opening angle ) ; and a parameter quantifying the density of the surrounding medium , @xmath234 ( for a uniform density ) or @xmath235 ( for an @xmath236 density profile ) .",
    "our broadband observations ( spanning from radio to x - rays ) should , in principle , allow us to firmly constrain most of these parameters for grb  071003  or , more accurately , to its late rebrightening phase , as this component is dominant at late times .",
    "the indices @xmath47 and @xmath176 are both well constrained at late times in the optical through x - ray bands , thanks to the wide range of temporal and spatial sampling : @xmath237 = 1.71 @xmath99 0.14 , @xmath165 = 0.93 @xmath99 0.03 .",
    "two environment models satisfy these constraints within 90% confidence : a wind - driven medium ( @xmath238 ) in which @xmath239 , and a model in which the jet break has already occurred with @xmath240 ( but consistent with @xmath241 ) .",
    "notably , ism models are a poor fit : the late - time decay rate is too fast for the shallow spectral index .",
    "the radio observations appear to support this conclusion : the rising light curve predicted by the ism model is clearly ruled out , and while the slow radio decay ( @xmath242 ) is inconsistent in detail with the wind prediction of constant evolution as well , it is conceivable that variations from an exact @xmath243 profile , an additional source of radio emission at early times ( e.g. , a reverse shock ) , or a soft jet break at @xmath244  days may explain this difficulty .",
    "the apparent spectral index of @xmath245 observed in the radio is notable .",
    "a synchrotron spectrum is expected to have a self - absorbed @xmath246 spectrum below the self - absorption frequency @xmath247 and a spectrum of @xmath248 above it .",
    "the fact that the observed spectral index is intermediate between these values and consistent with neither ( to @xmath4090% confidence ) tells us that , if the spectrum is really synchrotron , the absorption break is likely to be very close to these frequencies , although exact constraints are difficult with only two frequencies since the break is likely to be quite soft .",
    "the radio evolution appears nearly achromatic , which would argue against this interpretation , but considering the relatively narrow time and frequency window of the observations and unknown break sharpness , we feel that this is not a major concern .",
    "because the ism model is notably discrepant with the measured values of @xmath47 and @xmath176 , we unfortunately can not use the afterglow as a probe of the ambient density .",
    "if the wind model , which is more consistent with the observations in this case , is correct , we can calculate the parameter @xmath235 using ( for example ) equation 2 in @xcite :    @xmath249    while we have no direct measurement of @xmath250 , it is constrained by the radio and optical observations ( see figure [ fig : bbsed ] ) to be @xmath401 mjy ( within a factor of @xmath403 ) .",
    "we therefore measure @xmath251 , an interestingly low value regardless of the value of @xmath230 .",
    "while @xmath230 is not strongly constrained , the absence of a cooling break between the x - ray and optical bands during the first 5 days ( the cooling frequency @xmath252 increases in a wind model ) requires @xmath253 .",
    "it is possible that the wind model is inappropriate and the rapid optical decay is due to a jet that broke before our multicolor late - time observations .",
    "( one possible criticism of the wind model is that in this case , the color transition between early and late times is hard to explain ; because the cooling frequency rises with time , if @xmath217 late it must have been early as well under standard synchrotron evolution . however , because the rebrightening appears to be either a separate phenomenon or a large energy impulse that could conceivably have `` reset '' the synchrotron parameters [ including @xmath252 ] to new values , this may not be a major concern . )",
    "no jet break is observed in the light curve , but it is possible that a jet signature was concealed by the rebrightening .",
    "this case would certainly rule out the wide - angle jet interpretation of the secondary peak and would significantly reduce the energetics .",
    "the late - time spectroscopy and imaging tell a coherent story : unlike the vast majority of grbs @xcite , grb  071003 did not occur in a gas - rich of the average solar abudance .",
    "however , we consider a highly subluminous host a more likely possibility",
    ". both effects may be in play : low - luminosity galaxies , and those with low equivalent widths , tend to be relatively metal - poor @xcite .",
    "the environment is more consistent with a progenitor located in an outer galactic halo , or in an extremely small ( even compared to `` normal '' long - duration grb hosts ) and gas - poor galaxy . while the possibility of line saturation prevents us from setting definitive upper limits , the column density through any host is consistent with being 3 orders of magnitude below typical grb - derived values , and the contrast to the overall grb population - which is dominated by subluminous galaxies to begin with ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is dramatic .",
    "while it is well established that long - duration grbs generally originate from massive stars , we should be careful to ensure that our prior experience does not blind us to the existence of rarer subclasses of events .",
    "we note that one other grb on record , grb  070125 , had very similar properties : extremely low absorption and no coincident host @xcite , as well as a very bright afterglow and extreme energetics ( @xmath208 = @xmath255 erg ; @xcite ) , and even a ( mild ) late - time rebrightening @xcite .",
    "both are also among the few _ swift _ bursts detected at radio wavelengths .",
    "however , grb  070125 and grb  071003 show evidence from their broadband light curves of origins typical of ordinary long grbs . in the case of grb  070125 ,",
    "a constant but very high circumstellar density suggested that it occurred in what was locally a dense environment , not an empty galactic halo , despite the near absence of a large - scale gas signature in the spectrum . in our case , for grb  071003 , we find evidence of a wind - like stratified environment , a characteristic of a massive star .",
    "together , these events appear to suggest an origin for these `` halo '' bursts similar to those of all other grbs .",
    "if grb  071003 did occur in a star - forming region , then there are two possibilities consistent with the extremely small metal absorption in the spectrum .",
    "first , the burst may simply have formed in an extremely subluminous galaxy  necessarily , the number or distribution of such objects at very high redshift is not observationally constrained , but most simulations predict an abundance of small , highly sub - galactic halos in the universe that could very well harbor limited star formation .",
    "alternatively , grb  071003 may have occurred in a tidally stripped tail from another , larger galaxy . in this case",
    ", further follow - up observations should reveal a disturbed , star - forming host in the close vicinity of the burst .",
    "either scenario seems plausible to explain the constraints derived on the burst environment . in either case , if grbs are shown to be reasonable tracers of star formation at high redshift , then future large - sample grb spectroscopy missions may be able to place important constraints on the star - formation history of the universe not possible by any other means . while the sample size of such low - column - density grbs is now small ( two events , with grb  061021 [ @xcite ] possibly constituting a third example ) , these results are already suggestive that this fraction may be significant ( on the order of a few percent ) , and systematic rapid afterglow spectroscopy should continue to increase the number considerably over the years and decades to come .",
    "it would be an interesting discovery if the distribution of equivalent widths turns out to be bimodal .    on a related note",
    ", the existence of grb  071003 and grb  070125 may have important implications regarding the escape fraction of ionizing photons and the reionization history of the universe .",
    "although the relatively low redshift of these systems keeps the lyman-@xmath47 and lyman - break absorption features out of our spectral range and prevents us from measuring the h  i column density directly @xcite , these grbs provide evidence that massive stars can form well outside of gas - dense hosts , where there is little to shield the intergalactic medium from their ionizing uv radiation .",
    "if the fraction of these events is more than a few percent at @xmath256 , then such `` halo '' stars may in fact be primarily responsible for the reionization of the universe .",
    "observationally , spectroscopy of such events at these high redshifts may allow accurate measurement of the neutral gas fraction @xmath257 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) without the interference of saturated line profiles originating from the host galaxy .",
    "although the temporal evolution of the optical afterglow of grb 071003 is complicated , our early through late - time photometric follow - up data clearly resolve the optical light curve into separate components .",
    "observations from kait during the prompt phase of the grb revealed a slowly rising , slowly falling bump or flare component , superimposed on a simple fading power law that has no observable correlation with the prompt emission , suggesting that while early internal - shock flares can be observed in the optical , they are not necessarily the same as those producing the high - energy signatures .",
    "our late - time observations revealed one of the most dramatic late rebrightenings ever recorded in a grb light curve , and suggest that this feature is not due to a reverse - forward shock transition or density variation , requiring either angular jet structure or very discrete late - time re - energizing of the optical afterglow .",
    "this may have important implications for the interpretation of other , less dramatic bumps and rebrightenings at similar timescales that appear to be common features in grb afterglows .",
    "the spectroscopic study of grb 071003 offers a cautionary tale about the standard use of to infer a redshift : while it is common practice to use the highest - redshift system observed ( especially in the cases when the absorption is quite strong ) under the assumption that the grb host system should show significant metal absorption , here we have a clear case where this assumption is fundamentally flawed .",
    "s / n of the spectrum worse , or the host - galaxy absorption even weaker by a factor of only 23 , it is likely that we would have missed the higher - redshift system entirely and proceeded with the assumption that this burst was at a redshift of 1.100 instead of 1.604 . in light of this fact ,",
    "previous and future grb redshift claims based solely on identification of absorption should be regarded with increased skepticism .",
    "the intervening absorption systems are nevertheless also remarkable . with three completely independent systems along the line of sight",
    ", grb  071003 is among the most dramatic examples yet of the bizarre overabundance of these systems in grb afterglows relative to those of quasars",
    ". further study of this sightline , especially using ao systems , may help shed light on this mysterious result .",

    "<S> the optical afterglow of long - duration grb 071003 is among the brightest yet to be detected from any grb , with @xmath0 mag in kait observations starting 42  s after the grb trigger , including filtered detections during prompt emission . </S>",
    "<S> however , our high s / n ratio afterglow spectrum displays only extremely weak absorption lines at what we argue is the host redshift of @xmath1  in contrast to the three other , much stronger absorption systems observed at lower redshifts . together with keck adaptive optics observations which fail to reveal a host galaxy coincident with the burst position , our observations suggest a halo progenitor and offer a cautionary tale about the use of for grb redshift determination . </S>",
    "<S> we present early through late - time observations spanning the electromagnetic spectrum , constrain the connection between the prompt emission and early variations in the light curve ( we observe no correlation ) , and discuss possible origins for an unusual , marked rebrightening that occurs a few hours after the burst : likely either a late - time refreshed shock or a wide - angle secondary jet . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the late - time afterglow is most consistent with a wind environment , suggesting a massive star progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> together with grb  070125 , this may indicate that a small but significant portion of star formation in the early universe occurred far outside what we consider a normal galactic disk . </S>"
