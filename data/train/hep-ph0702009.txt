    "( for @xmath220 , both the cut and the uncut correlators have a similar behavior @xmath221 . )    now , fixing @xmath198 and @xmath199 according to the standard procedure ( [ delta2 ] ) , we express these quantities via the binding energy of the heavy meson @xmath222 defined according to @xmath223 : turns out to be different from @xmath198 .",
    "this has the following origin : if we include @xmath224 terms in the lc expansion of the cut correlator ( [ cutlc ] ) , cut them at @xmath225 , and determine the latter from eqs .",
    "( [ delta ] ) and ( [ delta2 ] ) , then @xmath226 . since we have included only one @xmath227 term , we obtain @xmath228 . ]",
    "@xmath229+\\cdots ,   \\ ] ] leading to @xmath230 and thus @xmath231 in the expressions above the dots denote terms containing higher powers of @xmath232 .",
    "this example illustrates that the off - lc effects may play an essential role in the cut correlators , as their contribution is not suppressed by any large parameter : the quantites @xmath13 and @xmath222 have the same order of magnitude .",
    "let us emphasize that we compare the full and the light - cone correlators evaluated at different values of the cut parameters @xmath199 and @xmath198 . from our point of view",
    "this very comparison is relevant if one wants to understand the error due to taking into account only the light - cone @xmath233 contribution to the correlator and neglecting terms containing higher powers of @xmath6 .",
    "one could also compare the correlators for the same value of @xmath4 .",
    "the difference between the full and the lc correlators is only slightly reduced in this case , the ratio still remaining @xmath234 .",
    "this can be seen by setting @xmath235 in ( [ 4.8 ] ) .",
    "the following lessons may be drawn from the results presented in this section :    * the off - lc effects play an essential role in the cut correlator , as they are not suppressed by any large parameter . numerically , the difference between the full and the lc correlators , evaluated at the same value of the borel parameter , is 10@xmath23620% .",
    "this difference is due to the off - lc effects . * the functions @xmath237 and",
    "@xmath238 have the same shape , but @xmath237 lies well above @xmath238 , if the standard procedure of fixing @xmath199 and @xmath198 ( [ delta2 ] ) is used .",
    "the values of both ( th and lc ) correlators obtained with @xmath198 and @xmath199 tuned at @xmath204 gev ( left column in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) are greater than the values of the respective correlators obtained with @xmath198 and @xmath199 tuned at @xmath208 gev ( right column in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the local stability is better when one fixes @xmath4 from ( [ delta2 ] ) at a larger value of @xmath150 ( right column in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) . in this case , both borel curves for @xmath239 and @xmath240 show a good stability in @xmath150 . nevertheless , still @xmath239 is much larger than @xmath240 !",
    "this illustrates that the borel stability _ per se _ does not guarantee the extraction of the correct physical value . *",
    "the difference between @xmath239 and @xmath240 increases with increasing mass of the light quark .",
    "therefore , this difference is expected to be greater for the heavy mesons @xmath241 and @xmath242 , containing the strange @xmath101-quark , than for @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "in this paper , we studied the correlator @xmath245 which is one of the basic objects for extracting the heavy - to - light form factor within the method of sum rules .",
    "we have shown that to leading @xmath2-accuracy this correlator may be calculated through the bs amplitude of the light meson @xmath246 expanding the bs amplitude near the light cone @xmath0 generates the light - cone expansion of the correlator .    making use of the nakanishi representation for the bs amplitude , we obtained dispersion representations for the full and the lc correlators in terms of the kernel @xmath32 of the nakanishi representation .",
    "we studied the full and the light - cone correlators and their borel transforms depending on the properties of the kernel @xmath32 .",
    "we then made use of the known solution for @xmath32 in a model with light scalar particles interacting by an exchange of a massless boson .",
    "this relatively simple model provides a good laboratory for studying qcd since the corresponding bound - state wave functions have properties similar to the properties of hadron wave functions in qcd .",
    "we calculated the full and the light - cone correlators and their borel transforms in the variable @xmath77 , and studied these correlators for various prescriptions to fix the heavy - hadron continuum subtraction and in various regions of the parameters relevant for extracting the heavy - to - light form factors .",
    "this work thus represents the first systematic study of the off - light - cone effects in qcd sum rules for heavy - to - light form factors .",
    "* we have seen that  after performing the borel transform  the light - cone correlator provides numerically the bulk of the full correlator , although parametrically the off - lc effects are not suppressed compared to the lc contribution .",
    "this observation holds for various prescriptions of fixing the heavy - hadron continuum subtraction point ( i.e. , a cut applied to the correlator for isolating the contribution of the heavy hadron of interest in the initial state ) and a wide range of masses of particles involved in the decay process .",
    "* we demonstrated that , nevertheless , the difference between the cut full and the cut light - cone correlators always remains nonvanishing .",
    "for example , fixing the continuum subtraction points the by standard criteria , we have found the following relation for the cut borel transforms of the full and the lc correlators for @xmath151 , @xmath148 , and @xmath143 : @xmath247 the correction being always negative . here",
    "@xmath13 is the effective constituent mass of the light quark , which emerges from the bs equation , @xmath248 , and @xmath222 is the binding energy of the heavy meson @xmath162 .",
    "taking into account that the constituent quark mass remains finite in the chiral limit , we come to the following important conclusion : _ in heavy - to - light decays , there exists no rigorous theoretical limit in which the cut lc correlator coincides with the cut full correlator_. + thus , the off - light - cone effects in sum rules for heavy - to - light correlators are not negligible and should be taken into account .",
    "* we note that the borel curves for the full and the lc correlators have similar shapes .",
    "however the light - cone correlator systematically _ overestimates _ the full correlator , the difference at small @xmath79 being @xmath5% in a wide range of the heavy - quark mass relevant for charm and beauty decays .",
    "we want to point out that the similarity of the borel curves for the full and the lc correlators implies that the systematic difference between the correlators can not be diminished by a relevant choice of the criterion for extracting the heavy - to - light form factor . + the observed effect might suggest a systematic uncertainty in the results for form factors obtained within light - cone sum rules . as follows from the relation ( [ result ] ) , this uncertainty is expected to be larger for decays of heavy mesons containing the strange quark , @xmath241 and @xmath242 , than for the @xmath243 and @xmath244 mesons .",
    "this issue deserves further investigation .",
    "finally , we point out the following : although the model , discussed here , in many aspects differs from qcd , this model mimics correctly those features which are essential for the effects discussed",
    ". therefore , many of the results obtained in this paper are valid also for qcd .",
    "in particular , the expression ( [ result ] ) suggests the following relationship between the light - cone and the full correlators in qcd for large values of @xmath10 and @xmath110 : @xmath249 in numerical estimates , we used the parameters relevant for @xmath243 and @xmath244 decays .",
    "we therefore believe that also the numerical estimates for higher - twist effects obtained in this work provide a realistic estimate for higher - twist effects in qcd .    _",
