    "among the solvable models of quantum mechanics , the lieb - liniger system @xcite belongs to the selective class of models that are genuinely many - body . it is a system made up of identical bosons interacting through two - body contact force .",
    "it was later shown that the one - dimensional system of identical fermions with two - body contact interactions can be rigorously mapped to the lieb - liniger system with strong and weak coupling regimes interchanged @xcite .",

    "it has been shown that the coupling strength of the lieb - liniger system can be experimentally controlled through the feshbach resonance mechanism @xcite . in recent experiments by haller and collaborators",
    "@xcite , a smooth change of the coupling strength from large negative values to large positive values , where one finds the super - tonks - girardeau system @xcite , has been realized .    the continuous transition from",
    "a strongly repulsive to strongly attractive regimes of lieb - liniger model inspires us to propose following parametric cycle @xmath1 .",
    "we start with the noninteracting limit , increase the coupling strength adiabatically , reaching the strongly attractive regime crossing the @xmath2 coupling limit , then decrease the absolute value of negative coupling strength until it reaches the noninteracting limit again . in this paper , we show that the initial energy eigenstates of the cycle are different from the final eigenstates , although the initial and the final hamiltonians are identical .",
    "this phenomenon , the so - called _ exotic _ quantum holonomy , in which quantum eigenvalues and eigenstates do not come back to the original ones after a cyclic parameter variation @xcite , belongs to a wider class of quantum holonomy that comprises both the celebrated berry phase @xcite and the wilczek - zee holonomy @xcite which appears in systems with degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "the exotic quantum holonomy in the @xmath3-function potential system was considered in @xcite . here",

    "the function @xmath24 completely characterizes the parametric evolution of eigenenergies , as well as the `` adiabatic '' evolution of eigenvectors along @xmath1 .",
    "the analysis is decomposed into the three stages @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .    at the initial point @xmath18 of the first stage @xmath12 , @xmath25 takes an integer value . without loss of generality",
    ", we can choose the order of @xmath24 s so as to satisfy @xmath26 for small positive @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "this ensures @xmath27 .",
    "we introduce two quantized quantities which is conserved during the parametric evolution of @xmath24 along @xmath12 .",

    "the final energy and state after the adiabatic cycle , however , are different from the initial ones , showing that @xmath1 induces the eigenenergy and eigenspace anholonomies  @xcite",
    ". we also remark that @xmath65 holds at the end of @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that we can repeat the adiabatic cycle @xmath1 arbitrarily , and the repetition of @xmath1 will induce the further instances of the eigenenergy and eigenspace anholonomies .",

    "formally , @xmath71 corresponds to the inverse of the mapping @xmath72 [ eq .  ] on the sets of quasimomenta at @xmath18 : @xmath73 where we impose the ordering condition @xmath74 .",
    "when the distance between @xmath75 s are far enough , @xmath76 preserves the ordering .",
    "this is the case that @xmath71 can be realized , and the resultant energy and quantum state are the solution of the eigenvalue problem of @xmath20 [ eq .  ] at @xmath18 .",
    "on the other hand , when a pair of @xmath75 s is too close , @xmath76 breaks the ordering , which implies the emergence of the clustering of particles during the inverse cycle .",
    "there are two possible cases .",
    "the first case is where a pair of quasimomenta , say , @xmath75 and @xmath77 , are degenerate , i.e. , @xmath78 . by applying @xmath76 , the resultant quasimomenta satisfy @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , the eigenenergy diverges @xmath16 as @xmath80 during @xmath71 . the second case",
    ", @xmath81 , also leads the clustering of particles .",
    "the argument above is sufficient to determine the condition for the minimal states . when there is , at least , a pair of two quasimomenta at @xmath18 that satisfies @xmath82 states specified by @xmath75 and @xmath77 are minimal states .",
    "because of the existence of quantum holonomy , some states are reachable by the repetitions of parametric cycles @xmath1 and @xmath71 starting from one particular eigenstate , while other states are not .",
    "this offers the classification of whole eigenstates into families of states connected by quantum holonomy .",
    "such a family can be specified by a minimal state introduced above , because an arbitrary eigenstate with a finite energy can become minimal by a finite repetition of @xmath71 .    from one minimal state",
