    "these closely orbiting disks rain metals onto the stellar photosphere , and contaminate an otherwise pristine hydrogen or helium atmospheric composition . for any particular cool white dwarf , the timescales for individual heavy elements to sink below the high gravity photosphere differ by less than a factor of three , yet are always orders of magnitude shorter than the cooling age @xcite . with an appropriate treatment of the accretion history ,",

    "the star itself is polluted by at least 15 elements heavier than hydrogen and helium , in an arrangement that is rich in refractory elements and deficient in volatiles ; a pattern that broadly mimics the inner solar system , and comparable with the outer composition of the earth and moon @xcite . a recent analysis of the unusual atmospheric mix of hydrogen and helium , together with x - ray constraints on the current hydrogen accretion rate at gd362 , suggests that if a single parent body gave rise to both the currently observed disk and the panoply of heavy elements in its atmosphere , then its mass would be larger than callisto , and possibly larger than mars @xcite .",
    "observations of a large number and variety of metal - polluted white dwarfs are necessary to better understand and constrain the connection between rocky extrasolar parent bodies , the circumstellar dust and gas , and the subsequent photospheric pollutions they create in white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the lifetimes of the disks at white dwarfs are poorly constrained at present , though there is some indication their lifetimes do not significantly exceed @xmath7yr @xcite .",
    "another outstanding issue is the nature of the large metal abundances in stars lacking excess infrared emission ; tenuous , gaseous , or previously - accreted disks are strong possibilities . while the evolution of optically thick dust at white dwarfs should be dominated by viscous dissipation - spreading , to date only g166 - 58 stands out as a possible indicator of how competing mechanisms , such as additional impacts or gas drag at the inner disk edge , may play a role @xcite .",

    "the irac fluxes have changed marginally following analysis of the newly available @xmath20pixel@xmath141 mosaics for this star . the excess can be reproduced by a 500k blackbody , implying the inner dust disk edge can not be significantly warmer .",
    "the flat ring model then predicts the innermost dust is located at 0.28@xmath139 , and far from where silicate grains should rapidly sublimate .",
    "therefore , the dust disk appears to have an enlarged , dust - free inner region .",
    "interestingly , pg1225@xmath2079 appears to have an excess only at 7.9@xmath5 m and may also represent a dust disk with a large inner ` hole ' .",
    "an excess flux is difficult to confirm with the current data alone , yet the irac images are of good quality and free of neighboring sources . if the excess is confirmed , the dust - free , inner region at pg1225@xmath2079 should be around three times larger than that inferred for g166 - 58 , but still located well within the roche limit for kilometer size or larger solid ( rocky or icy ) bodies @xcite .",
    "there are two distinct possibilities for such large dust - free zones : 1 ) the region is dominated by gaseous matter emitting inefficiently in the infrared or , 2 ) the region is depleted relative to the dust inferred from the observed infrared excess .",
    "the first possibility can arise if the inner dust disk region is impacted by a moderate size asteroid whose solid mass and angular momentum is dissipated via collisions prior to vaporizing the entire disk @xcite . in saturn s rings , the observed radial dark lanes or spokes",

    ". similar impacts upon dust disks at white dwarfs should release kinetic energies 1000 times higher due to the difference in gravitational potential ; the model radii and sizes of dust rings at white dwarfs are very similar to those of saturn .",
    "this model is attractive because it can account for disks with enlarged , dust - free inner regions or small outer radii ( including narrow rings ) as well as high accretion rate daz white dwarfs that lack infrared excess out to 7.9@xmath5 m yet require a nearby , ongoing source of photospheric heavy element pollution .",
    "g166 - 58 has a relatively long diffusion timescale for a daz star , around 2000yr for the observed calcium @xcite .",
    "this calculated lifetime does not guarantee accretion is ongoing , but the presence of orbiting dust makes it likely .",
    "perhaps more important , the absence of detectable dust need not imply an absence of accretion and photospheric pollution .",
    "while the disks at g166 - 58 and pg1225@xmath2079 may be partly composed of dust particles which are detected in the infrared , and partly of gaseous heavy elements which remain unseen , most metal - contaminated white dwarfs lack infrared dust signatures altogether @xcite .",
    "in many of these cases accretion must be ongoing and can be accounted for by the presence of either tenuous dust rings or completely gaseous disks @xcite ; unseen brown dwarf companions have been ruled out @xcite .",
    "the second possibility for dust disks with large inner holes is a relative dearth of dust ( and gas ) due to prior accretion ; i.e. a partly consumed disk .",
    "pg1225@xmath2079 has a heavy element diffusion timescale typical of cooler dbz stars , over 1myr for calcium @xcite . in this case",
    "the lifetime of metals implies that accretion need not currently proceed at a high rate , and the observed metals may be residuals from an older event . although the presence of an infrared excess , and hence the possibility of orbiting dust , make an ongoing accretion scenario likely , it raises an important question about the disk depletion timescale at white dwarfs .",
    "a prediction of ceased accretion would be higher relative atmospheric abundances of lighter elements @xcite , and is testable with good abundance data for pg1225@xmath2079 .",
    "in the appendix , a simple calculation demonstrates that radiation drag ( the poynting - robertson effect ) on particles is insufficient to drive the infall of disk material and account for the distribution of inferred heavy element accretion rates at disk - polluted daz stars @xcite . at the inner disk edge ,",
    "viscous spreading due to collisions between differentially rotating ring annuli and random motions among solids @xcite must be boosted by the presence of gas ( via sublimated or collisionally vaporized dust ) ; such enhancement must be significant .",
    "@xcite have shown that grains within white dwarf disks will collide on a timescale at least an order of magnitude shorter than their poynting - robertson lifetime .",
    "therefore , high viscosity resulting from dust - gas interactions must be ultimately responsible for the implied accretion rates from observed disks . for a disk that is otherwise optically thick at all relevant wavelengths ,",
    "only a tiny fraction of its total volume  only the inner edge  will be illuminated by the central star .",

    "the new additions to the plots continue the trend that metal accretion rates @xmath142gs@xmath18 are those that are most likely to exhibit infrared excess @xcite ; the sole exception is g166 - 58 .",
    "two of the disks discovered in this work orbit relatively cool white dwarfs with cooling ages of 0.73 and 0.94gyr .",
    "these are somewhat older than the previous average cooling age of white dwarfs with disks as found in @xcite , and may indicate relative longevity for orbiting dust .",
    "viscous spreading among solids may allow optically thick dust rings at white dwarfs to persist for at least 10myr timescales , possibly orders of magnitude longer , analogous to planetary rings .",
    "the inner radius of saturn s rings represents the furthest inner extent of its spreading over a period up to a few gyr @xcite . for dust rings at white dwarfs",
    ", gas drag should decrease the viscous timescale by orders of magnitude , but the gas content in most white dwarf disks is presently unconstrained . at the inner edge of a typical dust disk , rapid sublimation of dust",
    "will produce significant gas , as may grain - grain collisions .",
    "such viscosity enhancements are necessary to reproduce the dust accretion rates inferred for stars with short photospheric metal lifetimes .",
    "dust rings at white dwarfs are unlikely to be as simple as modeled here ; calcium triplet emission lines at three metal - polluted stars can be approximately reproduced by orbiting disks , but there are asymmetries which indicate deviations from the model @xcite .",
    "yet it is noteworthy that the simple model works rather well given only three free parameters , two of which  the inner and outer radius  are physically well - motivated .",
    "significant orbital energy must be shed to transform an asteroid on a perturbed , eccentric orbit into a disk contained entirely within the roche limit of a white dwarf .",
    "the primordial energy may dissipate partially via collisions which initially widen the disk ( or perhaps not in the case of narrow rings ) , yet an efficient way to discard orbital energy is within a large fragment of the tidally disrupted parent body . surviving fragments may be responsible for warps invoked in some disk models , such as gd362 and gd56 @xcite .",
    "saturn s ring - moon daphnis  8 km in diameter and comparable to a small asteroid  causes 1 km vertical disturbances in the a ring ; 100 times larger than the height of the unperturbed rings @xcite .",
